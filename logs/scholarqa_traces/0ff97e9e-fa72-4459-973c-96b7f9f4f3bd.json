The tremendous success of mRNA vaccines in effectively combatting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) evidences the unlimited medical and therapeutic potential of mRNA technology. Overcoming challenges related to mRNA stability, immunogenicity, and precision targeting has been made possible by recent advancements in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). This review summarizes state-of-the-art LNP-mRNA-based therapeutics, including their structure, material compositions, design guidelines, and screening principles. Additionally, we highlight current preclinical and clinical trends in LNP-mRNA therapeutics in a broad range of treatments in ophthalmological conditions, cancer immunotherapy, gene editing, and rare-disease medicine. Particular attention is given to the translation and evolution of LNP-mRNA vaccines into a broader spectrum of therapeutics. We explore concerns in the aspects of inadequate extrahepatic targeting efficacy, elevated doses, safety concerns, and challenges of large-scale production procedures. This discussion may offer insights and perspectives on near- and long-term clinical development prospects for LNP-mRNA therapeutics.",

[69] engineered aerosolized LNPs for pulmonary delivery of mRNA.They optimized PEGylation parameters to achieve efficient mRNA delivery to the lungs.They found that increasing the PEG ratio in the LNP formulation not only reduced the size of LNPs but also decreased intracellular protein expression of mRNA.Therefore, precise consideration of the extent of PEG-anchored lipids is crucial when designing LNP-mRNA for lung therapeutics.This approach represents a significant advancement in developing noninvasive respiratory therapies with potential applications in treating various pulmonary diseases.\n\nThe protein corona phenomenon, mainly influenced by the surface properties of LNPs, has become popular among researchers in the field of nanosized drug delivery systems.After the administration of LNPs, serum proteins are adsorbed on the surface of the nanoparticles evidently, forming a protein corona.This corona may impede targeted efficacy by shielding surface ligands necessary for specific cell or receptor recognition.Surface-exposed PEGylated lipids play a crucial role in determining and regulating the composition of the corona proteins on LNPs.Parallelly, the compositions of the corona proteins can govern the distributions of the nanoparticles due to the organ-specific accumulations of the serum proteins, such as ApoE for the liver and complementary system-related proteins for the spleen.\n\nIn a recent study, Chen et al. [70] investigated the role of apolipoprotein-and vitronectin-enriched corona on LNPs for targeted delivery and transfection of oligonucleotides in murine tumor models.A slight change in the physicochemical properties of LNPs altered the corona pattern.For instance, the introduction of positive charge via cationic lipid 3\u03b2-{N-[2-(dimethylamino) ethyl]carbamoyl}cholesterol (DC-cholesterol) as a substitution for original cholesterol shifted the protein corona pattern from apolipoprotein-rich to vitronectin-rich.",

The tremendous success of mRNA vaccines in effectively combatting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) evidences the unlimited medical and therapeutic potential of mRNA technology. Overcoming challenges related to mRNA stability, immunogenicity, and precision targeting has been made possible by recent advancements in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). This review summarizes state-of-the-art LNP-mRNA-based therapeutics, including their structure, material compositions, design guidelines, and screening principles. Additionally, we highlight current preclinical and clinical trends in LNP-mRNA therapeutics in a broad range of treatments in ophthalmological conditions, cancer immunotherapy, gene editing, and rare-disease medicine. Particular attention is given to the translation and evolution of LNP-mRNA vaccines into a broader spectrum of therapeutics. We explore concerns in the aspects of inadequate extrahepatic targeting efficacy, elevated doses, safety concerns, and challenges of large-scale production procedures. This discussion may offer insights and perspectives on near- and long-term clinical development prospects for LNP-mRNA therapeutics.\n## PEGylated lipid-Modulating serum protein adsorption for tissue targeting\nThe study highlighted that pH-responsive PEG lipids facilitated improved active targeting and gene silencing efficacy in hepatocytes.Furthermore, the PEG content significantly affects targeting of extrahepatic tissues.For instance, Zhang et al. [69] engineered aerosolized LNPs for pulmonary delivery of mRNA.They optimized PEGylation parameters to achieve efficient mRNA delivery to the lungs.They found that increasing the PEG ratio in the LNP formulation not only reduced the size of LNPs but also decreased intracellular protein expression of mRNA.Therefore, precise consideration of the extent of PEG-anchored lipids is crucial when designing LNP-mRNA for lung therapeutics.This approach represents a significant advancement in developing noninvasive respiratory therapies with potential applications in treating various pulmonary diseases.\n\nThe protein corona phenomenon, mainly influenced by the surface properties of LNPs, has become popular among researchers in the field of nanosized drug delivery systems.After the administration of LNPs, serum proteins are adsorbed on the surface of the nanoparticles evidently, forming a protein corona.This corona may impede targeted efficacy by shielding surface ligands necessary for specific cell or receptor recognition.Surface-exposed PEGylated lipids play a crucial role in determining and regulating the composition of the corona proteins on LNPs.Parallelly, the compositions of the corona proteins can govern the distributions of the nanoparticles due to the organ-specific accumulations of the serum proteins, such as ApoE for the liver and complementary system-related proteins for the spleen.\n\nIn a recent study, Chen et al. [70] investigated the role of apolipoprotein-and vitronectin-enriched corona on LNPs for targeted delivery and transfection of oligonucleotides in murine tumor models.A slight change in the physicochemical properties of LNPs altered the corona pattern.For instance, the introduction of positive charge via cationic lipid 3\u03b2-{N-[2-(dimethylamino) ethyl]carbamoyl}cholesterol (DC-cholesterol) as a substitution for original cholesterol shifted the protein corona pattern from apolipoprotein-rich to vitronectin-rich.\n...\nFor instance, the introduction of positive charge via cationic lipid 3\u03b2-{N-[2-(dimethylamino) ethyl]carbamoyl}cholesterol (DC-cholesterol) as a substitution for original cholesterol shifted the protein corona pattern from apolipoprotein-rich to vitronectin-rich.In the aspect of transfection performance, nanoparticles with apolipoproteinrich corona showed better delivery to hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) as compared to those with vitronectin-rich corona.LNPs formulated with PEG-conjugated C18 lipids (either 3% or 6% molar ratio) were proved to be optimal for in vivo delivery to HepG2 tumor.The study revealed that the composition of the protein corona influenced the biodistribution and targeting efficiency of LNPs, highlighting the complex interplay between nanoparticle surface properties, including surface-coating PEG, protein interactions, and in vivo performance.\n\nIn conclusion, PEGylated lipids play multiple roles in enhancing the performance of LNPs as drug delivery systems for therapeutic mRNA.Through studies that examined PEG shedding rates, protein corona formation, and pH-labile PEGylation, researchers have gained valuable insights into optimizing the effectiveness of LNPs by manipulating surface PEG.These advancements in PEGylation strategies hold promise for the design of precise and efficient delivery systems for therapeutic nucleic acid, especially mRNA.\n\n## Emerging technologies boosting the tissue targeting efficacy\nIn the case of LNPs, PEG length and alkyl chain affect both surface chemistry and PEG shedding rate [67], thereby influencing the surface coronation and targeting tissues.Pegylation plays a crucial role in determining the in vivo destination of LNPs and their payloads, suggesting its significance for LNP-mRNA therapeutic applications.Despite all the strides made, the underlying mechanisms and relationships between tissue targeting properties of LNP and protein corona formation remain elusive.Certain occurrences, such as the alteration of corona formation, have resulted in changes in tissue accumulation, yet a proper explanation is lacking [70].\n\nPrevious attempts illustrated that specific protein may serve as the nutrition or major supplement for the organs or the cells.There is also an explanation related to the receptor-mediated recognition, for which the most commonly acknowledged one is LDLR-corona protein-ApoE assisted liver targeting of LNP.However, various LDL receptors were identified other than ApoE, such as ApoA1.Basic knowledge related to physiology and pharmacodynamics remains to be explored.Therefore, while we appreciate the creativity of the concept of corona, it currently serves no more than a hypothesis in a long journey to promote LNP-mRNA into clinical stage.The lack of a liable detection technique also hinders the understanding of the protein corona phenomenon and stalls its development.Enabling in situ analysis of protein corona formation is crucial since current post-analysis via centrifugation separation and mass spectrometry is insufficient to unveil the authentic situation of protein adsorption around LNPs in the blood circulation.In a recent work, Zhan and colleagues [97] optimized the extraction of the corona in incubating serum by applying chromatography containing PEG-scFv (single-chain variable fragment).This facilitated the separation of pegylated nanoparticles and proteins while minimizing the depletion of protein corona components.Last but not least, predicting the in vivo performance of the corona protein formation around LNP, especially the stereochemistry and conformation of the absorbed proteins, which are essential to the cell-specific internalizations and successful translation of actively targeted LNP-mRNA, remains challenging.",

            "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are leading mRNA delivery vehicles, with ionizable lipids (ILs) as their key component. However, the relationship between the IL structure and LNP endogenous organ-targeting is not well understood. In this study, we developed a novel library of biodegradable ILs featuring beta-propionate linkers, which, when incorporated into a four-component LNP formulation, show excellent extrahepatic selectivity and high protein expression. Methods: We explored the impact of structural modifications in the hydrophobic chains and polar-head groups in the ILs while keeping the linkers unchanged. In vivo results were evaluated to examine how structural changes influence the biodistribution to spleen or lungs. LNP formulations were assessed for their protein expression levels and organ-specific targeting. Additionally, protein corona formation by the best-performing LNPs was examined to provide further mechanistic insights. Results: Organ targeting was significantly influenced by structural changes in the ILs, allowing for precise control of the biodistribution between the spleen and lungs. Branched hydrophobic chains demonstrated a higher propensity for spleen targeting, while modifications in the polar-head group could drastically shift biodistribution from the lung to the spleen. This led to the identification of LNPs\u2019 zeta potential as a key determinant of their extrahepatic targeting properties. Notably, ionizable lipid A3T2C7, also known as CP-LC-1495, displayed strong lung selectivity (97%) and high protein expression in lung tissue (1.21 \u00d7 108 p/s). Similarly, several promising candidates for spleen-targeting LNPs displayed protein expression levels exceeding 1 \u00d7 107 p/s (selectivity >80%). Conclusions: This study elucidates the structure\u2013function relationships of ILs in passive organ-specific mRNA delivery, highlighting how the fine-tuning of hydrophobic chains, polar-head groups, and surface charge (zeta potential) allows for the precise control of LNP endogenous biodistribution, a mechanism influenced by protein corona formation. These findings enable the rational design of targeted LNP systems, enhancing their therapeutic potential for specific organs, such as the spleen and lungs.",

Our data show that the lipid composition strongly influences their protein adsorption patterns, affecting their physicochemical properties and ultimately controlling tissue tropism. Lung-targeting LNPs exhibited distinct protein enrichment, including of vitronectin and prothrombin, supporting previously described mechanisms of protein corona-mediated lung selectivity [35]. In contrast, the protein-corona composition of spleen-targeting LNPs lacked a clear correlation with known targeting pathways, suggesting an alternative, but as-yet unidentified, mechanism of action. \n\nIn conclusion, these findings provide a strong foundation for the rational design of LNP systems with enhanced organ-targeting precision, guided by the structure-activity relationships of ionizable lipids and the LNP zeta potential. Understanding the molecular basis of extrahepatic targeting, including the key protein interactions that drive LNP accumulation in extrahepatic tissue, will be critical for optimizing these formulations for clinical use. Future studies should aim to elucidate these mechanisms and to evaluate the full safety profile, stability, and therapeutic potential of these LNPs in clinically relevant models. This approach holds significant promise for improving the specificity and efficacy of mRNA-based therapies, enabling more precise extrahepatic delivery and expanding the therapeutic landscape for a broad range of clinical applications, including in vaccines, cancer immunotherapy, and treatments for genetic and inflammatory diseases.",

                    "text": "The composition of the protein corona that forms around LNPs upon exposure to biological fluids is a key factor in their organ selectivity and biodistribution [28,35]. Given this well-established relationship, we sought to investigate whether the differences in our extrahepatic lipid library were reflected in distinct protein corona compositions, which could potentially explain their selective accumulation in non-hepatic tissues. With that purpose, we selected and purified the two top-performing ionizable lipids for lung targeting (A1T2C3, also named CP-LC-1067, and A3T2C7, also named CP-LC-1495) and the highestperforming lipid for spleen targeting (A2T2C9, also named CP-LC-1465). As controls, we included MC3-DOTAP and MC3-18:1 PA, well-established SORT formulations known for targeting the lung and spleen, respectively, with previously characterized protein coronas [12]. Additionally, we incorporated liver-targeting LNPs using SM-102 as the ionizable lipid and a control without LNPs. Subsequently, to mimic the in vivo environment, we incubated LNPs with human plasma, allowing the natural formation of a protein corona similar to that occurring in the bloodstream (Figure 4A). After purification and LNP proteincorona isolation, we performed mass-spectrometry-based proteomic analysis to identify and quantify the adsorbed proteins. \n\nPharmaceutics 2025, 17, x FOR PEER REVIEW 14 of 19 potential was identified as a key factor in organ targeting by our ionizable lipid library, we further analyzed its influence on related protein properties such as isoelectric point (pI) and overall charge. We found that in lung-targeting LNPs, the isoelectric point distribution of adsorbed proteins was slightly shifted toward pI ~5.5 compared with liver-and spleen-targeting LNPs (Figure 4C). This may be attributed to their higher zeta potential, which likely influences protein binding. Notably, vitronectin [12], a key mediator of lung uptake, has a pI of ~5.5, suggesting a potential explanation for this enrichment.",

These findings suggest that lipid composition influences not only protein adsorption but also the physicochemical characteristics of the corona, impacting organ-specific delivery. \n\nTo further investigate protein-corona-driven targeting, we analyzed the top 30 most abundant proteins in lung-and spleen-targeting LNP coronas (Tables S5-S10). Additionally, to provide a clearer interpretation of the results, we focused on proteins that were highly enriched in one organ-specific LNP corona while being absent or barely detected in the other (Figure 4E,F). Results showed that the predominant proteins absorbed in spleentargeting LNPs are actin, myosin, and the immunoglobulin lambda-like protein. These proteins exhibit a low correlation and are typically nonspecific and are often found in negative mass spectrometry controls. Therefore, the mechanism underlying spleen targeting remains unclear. However, the protein-corona composition of lung-targeting LNPs was clearly distinct from that of liver-and spleen-targeting LNPs. Notably, vitronectin and prothrombin, both extensively reported as key protein-corona components influencing lung targeting, were among the most enriched proteins [12,13,27]. These findings suggest that lung-targeting LNPs in our ionizable lipid library follow previously described mechanisms of proteincorona-mediated lung selectivity.",

However, the relationship between the IL structure and LNP endogenous organ-targeting is not well understood. In this study, we developed a novel library of biodegradable ILs featuring beta-propionate linkers, which, when incorporated into a four-component LNP formulation, show excellent extrahepatic selectivity and high protein expression. Methods: We explored the impact of structural modifications in the hydrophobic chains and polar-head groups in the ILs while keeping the linkers unchanged. In vivo results were evaluated to examine how structural changes influence the biodistribution to spleen or lungs. LNP formulations were assessed for their protein expression levels and organ-specific targeting. Additionally, protein corona formation by the best-performing LNPs was examined to provide further mechanistic insights. Results: Organ targeting was significantly influenced by structural changes in the ILs, allowing for precise control of the biodistribution between the spleen and lungs. Branched hydrophobic chains demonstrated a higher propensity for spleen targeting, while modifications in the polar-head group could drastically shift biodistribution from the lung to the spleen. This led to the identification of LNPs\u2019 zeta potential as a key determinant of their extrahepatic targeting properties. Notably, ionizable lipid A3T2C7, also known as CP-LC-1495, displayed strong lung selectivity (97%) and high protein expression in lung tissue (1.21 \u00d7 108 p/s). Similarly, several promising candidates for spleen-targeting LNPs displayed protein expression levels exceeding 1 \u00d7 107 p/s (selectivity >80%). Conclusions: This study elucidates the structure\u2013function relationships of ILs in passive organ-specific mRNA delivery, highlighting how the fine-tuning of hydrophobic chains, polar-head groups, and surface charge (zeta potential) allows for the precise control of LNP endogenous biodistribution, a mechanism influenced by protein corona formation. These findings enable the rational design of targeted LNP systems, enhancing their therapeutic potential for specific organs, such as the spleen and lungs.\n## Proteomic Analysis of Top-Performing LNPs in Extrahepatic Targeting\nThe composition of the protein corona that forms around LNPs upon exposure to biological fluids is a key factor in their organ selectivity and biodistribution [28,35]. Given this well-established relationship, we sought to investigate whether the differences in our extrahepatic lipid library were reflected in distinct protein corona compositions, which could potentially explain their selective accumulation in non-hepatic tissues. With that purpose, we selected and purified the two top-performing ionizable lipids for lung targeting (A1T2C3, also named CP-LC-1067, and A3T2C7, also named CP-LC-1495) and the highestperforming lipid for spleen targeting (A2T2C9, also named CP-LC-1465). As controls, we included MC3-DOTAP and MC3-18:1 PA, well-established SORT formulations known for targeting the lung and spleen, respectively, with previously characterized protein coronas [12]. Additionally, we incorporated liver-targeting LNPs using SM-102 as the ionizable lipid and a control without LNPs. Subsequently, to mimic the in vivo environment, we incubated LNPs with human plasma, allowing the natural formation of a protein corona similar to that occurring in the bloodstream (Figure 4A). After purification and LNP proteincorona isolation, we performed mass-spectrometry-based proteomic analysis to identify and quantify the adsorbed proteins. \n\nPharmaceutics 2025, 17, x FOR PEER REVIEW 14 of 19 potential was identified as a key factor in organ targeting by our ionizable lipid library, we further analyzed its influence on related protein properties such as isoelectric point (pI) and overall charge. We found that in lung-targeting LNPs, the isoelectric point distribution of adsorbed proteins was slightly shifted toward pI ~5.5 compared with liver-and spleen-targeting LNPs (Figure 4C). This may be attributed to their higher zeta potential, which likely influences protein binding. Notably, vitronectin [12], a key mediator of lung uptake, has a pI of ~5.5, suggesting a potential explanation for this enrichment.\n...\nWhile surface charge impacts protein adsorption, it operates within a complex electrostatic environment, which could explain the subtler differences in protein-charge profiles compared with pI trends. These findings suggest that lipid composition influences not only protein adsorption but also the physicochemical characteristics of the corona, impacting organ-specific delivery. \n\nTo further investigate protein-corona-driven targeting, we analyzed the top 30 most abundant proteins in lung-and spleen-targeting LNP coronas (Tables S5-S10). Additionally, to provide a clearer interpretation of the results, we focused on proteins that were highly enriched in one organ-specific LNP corona while being absent or barely detected in the other (Figure 4E,F). Results showed that the predominant proteins absorbed in spleentargeting LNPs are actin, myosin, and the immunoglobulin lambda-like protein. These proteins exhibit a low correlation and are typically nonspecific and are often found in negative mass spectrometry controls. Therefore, the mechanism underlying spleen targeting remains unclear. However, the protein-corona composition of lung-targeting LNPs was clearly distinct from that of liver-and spleen-targeting LNPs. Notably, vitronectin and prothrombin, both extensively reported as key protein-corona components influencing lung targeting, were among the most enriched proteins [12,13,27]. These findings suggest that lung-targeting LNPs in our ionizable lipid library follow previously described mechanisms of proteincorona-mediated lung selectivity.\n\n## Conclusions\nFurthermore, we examined the protein corona profiles of our most effective ILs to gain insights into their targeting mechanisms. Our data show that the lipid composition strongly influences their protein adsorption patterns, affecting their physicochemical properties and ultimately controlling tissue tropism. Lung-targeting LNPs exhibited distinct protein enrichment, including of vitronectin and prothrombin, supporting previously described mechanisms of protein corona-mediated lung selectivity [35]. In contrast, the protein-corona composition of spleen-targeting LNPs lacked a clear correlation with known targeting pathways, suggesting an alternative, but as-yet unidentified, mechanism of action. \n\nIn conclusion, these findings provide a strong foundation for the rational design of LNP systems with enhanced organ-targeting precision, guided by the structure-activity relationships of ionizable lipids and the LNP zeta potential. Understanding the molecular basis of extrahepatic targeting, including the key protein interactions that drive LNP accumulation in extrahepatic tissue, will be critical for optimizing these formulations for clinical use. Future studies should aim to elucidate these mechanisms and to evaluate the full safety profile, stability, and therapeutic potential of these LNPs in clinically relevant models. This approach holds significant promise for improving the specificity and efficacy of mRNA-based therapies, enabling more precise extrahepatic delivery and expanding the therapeutic landscape for a broad range of clinical applications, including in vaccines, cancer immunotherapy, and treatments for genetic and inflammatory diseases.",

The development of a protein corona affects the chemical and physical characteristics of LNPs, increasing the hydrodynamic diameter and modifying the charge on the surface. Nevertheless, all protein coronas contained different patterns of proteins related with the immune response, the metabolism of lipids and the transport capacity, to modulate, in diverse ways, LNP-cell interactions [116]. The initial physicochemical characteristics, including particle size, surface properties, composition, and structure, predominantly determine the biological fate of LNPs within the gastrointestinal tract. Absorption primarily takes place in the small intestine. Notably, LNPs can be categorized as either digestible or indigestible based on their composition, resulting in two distinct biological paths for LNPs. Digestible LNPs undergo digestion initiated by lipases and subsequent hydrolysis across the GI tract upon ingestion. This process leads to the breakdown of lipids, resulting in lipid digestion products rich in fatty acids and monoglycerides. These products, along with encapsulated drugs, bile salts, and phospholipids, form mixed micelles. After absorption by enterocytes, these lipid digestion products and encapsulated drugs enter the systemic circulation through either the portal vein or the lymphatic system. The specific route taken depends on the lipid structure within the LNP formulation and the hydrophobic nature of the encapsulated drugs. Alternatively, indigestible LNPs can remain intact and potentially penetrate the mucus layer to reach epithelial surfaces. After penetration, these LNPs can be transported through the tight junction, or absorbed up by enterocytes or transported by M cells, to enter the circulation [117].",

Despite advancements in drug discovery and the development of novel therapeutics, the effective delivery of these agents to the CNS remains a serious challenge due to the restrictive nature of the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB). This underscores the need to develop a novel drug delivery system. Recent studies have identified oral lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) as a promising approach to efficiently deliver drugs across the BBB and treat neurological diseases. This review aims to comprehensively summarize the recent advancements in the development of LNPs designed for the controlled delivery and therapeutic modulation of CNS diseases through oral administration. Furthermore, this review addresses the mechanisms by which these LNPs overcome biological barriers and evaluate their clinical implications and therapeutic efficacy in the context of oral drug delivery systems. Specifically, it focuses on LNP formulations that facilitate oral administration, exploring their potential to enhance bioavailability, improve targeting precision, and alleviate or manage the symptoms associated with a range of CNS diseases.",

Zou, Jing Zhang, Longmin Chen, Qianqian Xu, Sheng Yao, Hong Chen\n## Abstract\nNeuroinflammation within the central nervous system (CNS) is a primary characteristic of CNS diseases, such as Parkinson\u2019s disease, Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and mental disorders. The excessive activation of immune cells results in the massive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which subsequently induce neuronal death and accelerate the progression of neurodegeneration. Therefore, mitigating excessive neuroinflammation has emerged as a promising strategy for the treatment of CNS diseases. Despite advancements in drug discovery and the development of novel therapeutics, the effective delivery of these agents to the CNS remains a serious challenge due to the restrictive nature of the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB). This underscores the need to develop a novel drug delivery system. Recent studies have identified oral lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) as a promising approach to efficiently deliver drugs across the BBB and treat neurological diseases. This review aims to comprehensively summarize the recent advancements in the development of LNPs designed for the controlled delivery and therapeutic modulation of CNS diseases through oral administration. Furthermore, this review addresses the mechanisms by which these LNPs overcome biological barriers and evaluate their clinical implications and therapeutic efficacy in the context of oral drug delivery systems. Specifically, it focuses on LNP formulations that facilitate oral administration, exploring their potential to enhance bioavailability, improve targeting precision, and alleviate or manage the symptoms associated with a range of CNS diseases.\n## Systemic Circulation\nLNPs possess high free energy due to their small size and large surface area, which promotes their interactions with biological macromolecules in biological fluids. Upon entering systemic circulation, NPs acquire a protein corona (PC), a layer of adsorbed proteins that alters their biological identity [121]. Protein adsorption on LNPs depends on both the surface charge and the type of coating used. Studies have shown that high surface charge density increases protein adsorption, while specific coatings, such as Poloxamers, can enhance selective protein adsorption [122] and facilitate the BBB uptake process [123]. Conversely, proteins from the complement system, known as opsonins, mark LNPs for recognition by the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS), thereby accelerating their clearance and reducing their systemic circulation time [124]. \n\nTo avoid rapid opsonization and MPS clearance, stealth NPs have been developed using PEG coatings, which delay PC formation and extend NP half-life in circulation. However, PEGylation has limitations, such as anti-PEG antibody production and reduced cellular internalization. Alternative strategies, including stimuli-responsive PEG derivatives, have been explored to address these challenges [125]. Other strategies have also been proposed to reduce or avoid PC formation, such as coating NPs with substances like glutathione or functionalizing their surfaces with polymers to minimize non-specific interactions [126]. Synthetic polymer conjugates, like amphiphilic N-(2-hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide (HPMA) copolymer, can provide NPs with an \"invisibility cloak\" against serum proteins [127]. Recent advancements suggest that using cell membrane fragments as nanoparticle surface coatings can enhance their circulation time and targeting capability [128]. These hybrid nanomaterials combine the properties of biological cell membranes with those of synthetic nanoparticles [129]. This approach provides immune camouflage, reduces leukocyte uptake, and offers the potential to target non-immune cells like astrocytes and neurons. Membrane-coated nanoparticles and cell membrane-derived nanovesicles are emerging strategies for novel diagnostic and therapeutic applications across various diseases.",

Moreover, the roles of different formulations in differential biological distribution, as well as the general relationship between lipid structure, formulation, and activity, are areas that require further exploration. 122 iScience Review Figure 6. Representative chemical structures of key lipids designed for organ-selective nucleic acids delivery Proteins from plasma are adsorbed onto the LNPs surface to form a protein corona in the blood circulation. The protein corona formed on LNPs after intravenous injection contains hundreds of biomolecules (mainly proteins and lipids). LNPs are cleared and extravasated from the circulation, and ultimately function intracellularly via cellular uptake and undergo organ, cellular, and molecular biological processes. 138 The composition of the protein corona is influenced by the chemical and molecular components of the surface of the LNPs, as well as its charge. This formation of protein coronas allows the fate of LNPs in vivo to be predicted, and even the targeting ligands can be shielded so that LNPs can be delivered less efficiently. Thus, understanding protein corona can help in the design of novel targeted LNPs. 20 sually, the formation of protein corona reduces the delivery efficiency of LNPs, and encapsulation of LNPs on the surface with PEG or other materials usually inhibits the formation of protein corona and prolongs the blood circulation of LNPs. 139 Recent studies have shown that apolipoproteins can be incorporated into protein corona, exerting endogenous targeting properties and playing an important role in organ-and cell-specific targeting of LNPs. 140",

Moreover, the roles of different formulations in differential biological distribution, as well as the general relationship between lipid structure, formulation, and activity, are areas that require further exploration. 122 iScience Review Figure 6. Representative chemical structures of key lipids designed for organ-selective nucleic acids delivery Proteins from plasma are adsorbed onto the LNPs surface to form a protein corona in the blood circulation. The protein corona formed on LNPs after intravenous injection contains hundreds of biomolecules (mainly proteins and lipids). LNPs are cleared and extravasated from the circulation, and ultimately function intracellularly via cellular uptake and undergo organ, cellular, and molecular biological processes. 138 The composition of the protein corona is influenced by the chemical and molecular components of the surface of the LNPs, as well as its charge. This formation of protein coronas allows the fate of LNPs in vivo to be predicted, and even the targeting ligands can be shielded so that LNPs can be delivered less efficiently. Thus, understanding protein corona can help in the design of novel targeted LNPs. 20 sually, the formation of protein corona reduces the delivery efficiency of LNPs, and encapsulation of LNPs on the surface with PEG or other materials usually inhibits the formation of protein corona and prolongs the blood circulation of LNPs. 139 Recent studies have shown that apolipoproteins can be incorporated into protein corona, exerting endogenous targeting properties and playing an important role in organ-and cell-specific targeting of LNPs. 140\n...\nRecent studies have shown that apolipoproteins can be incorporated into protein corona, exerting endogenous targeting properties and playing an important role in organ-and cell-specific targeting of LNPs. 140 Understanding the components of LNPs and the nature of the protein coronas will be more useful in understanding the subsequent fate of LNPs in vivo and in designing organ-targeted LNPs for treating specific diseases. 122 ince apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is involved in endogenous cholesterol transport, it binds to the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) overexpressed in hepatocytes and enters the cell via receptor-mediated endocytosis.

The scope of LNP applications in terms of RNA is not limited to antiviral vaccines but encompasses anticancer drugs and therapeutics for genetic (including rare) diseases.

SPR has been applied to study the interplay between NPs and isolated serum proteins in order to optimize LNP's formulation design (Table 1). SPR has contributed to study fibrinogen, human serum albumin and bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor adsorption onto both neutral and negatively charged PEG-decorated liposomes (Efremova et al., 2000). Interestingly, the observed reduction in protein adsorption as PEG densities in the nanovehicles increases agreed with theoretical predictions. These results suggest that SPR studies could contribute to establish the physical basis of the different interactions of LNPs with proteins and cells. Moreover, particular proteins of the NPs' corona were identified by means of SPR experiments on LNPs preincubated with serum (Canovi et al., 2012) and the real-time protein corona formation was followed on surface-immobilized NPs (Kari et al., 2017).",

Moreover, SPR has contributed to the obtention and characterization of LNPs, gathering information about the interplay between components of the formulations, their response to organic molecules and, more recently, the quantification and molecular characterization of exosomes. By the combination of available sensor platforms, assay quickness and straight forward platform adaptation for new carrier systems, SPR is becoming a high throughput technique for LNPs' characterization and analysis.\n## Interaction With Serum Proteins\nIt is well-known that the interaction of drug nanocarriers with serum proteins can alter the pharmacokinetics of the nanovehicles either affecting the cellular uptake or the clearance of the particles by the immune system (Pearson et al., 2014). SPR has been applied to study the interplay between NPs and isolated serum proteins in order to optimize LNP's formulation design (Table 1). SPR has contributed to study fibrinogen, human serum albumin and bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor adsorption onto both neutral and negatively charged PEG-decorated liposomes (Efremova et al., 2000). Interestingly, the observed reduction in protein adsorption as PEG densities in the nanovehicles increases agreed with theoretical predictions. These results suggest that SPR studies could contribute to establish the physical basis of the different interactions of LNPs with proteins and cells. Moreover, particular proteins of the NPs' corona were identified by means of SPR experiments on LNPs preincubated with serum (Canovi et al., 2012) and the real-time protein corona formation was followed on surface-immobilized NPs (Kari et al., 2017).",

            "abstract": "Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is used in Lipid Nanoparticles (LNPs) formulations to confer stealth properties and is traditionally anchored in membranes by a lipid moiety whose length significantly impacts the LNPs fate in vivo. C18 acyl chains are efficiently anchored in the membrane, while shorter C14 lipids are quickly desorbed and replaced by a protein corona responsible for the completely different fate of LNPs. In this context, a method to predict the biological behavior of LNPs depending on the lipid-PEG dissociation was developed using the Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA) method in serum. Two formulations of siRNA-containing LNPs were prepared including CSL3 or SM-102 lipids and were grafted with different lipids-PEG (C18, C14 lipids-PEG, and Ceramide-PEG). The impact of the lipid-PEG on the interactions between LNPs and serum components was demonstrated by monitoring the mean particle size and the concentration over time. In vitro, these formulations demonstrated low toxicity and efficient gene knockdown on tumor MDA-MB-231 cells, but serum was found to significantly impact the efficiency of C18-PEG-based LNPs, while it did not impact the efficiency of C14-PEG-based LNPs. The NTA method demonstrated the ability to discriminate between the behaviors of LNPs according to serum proteins\u2019 interactions. CSL3 lipid and Cer-PEG were confirmed to have promise for LNP formulation.",

                    "text": "Recently, the transfection of HepG2 cells with LNPs also showed the impact of C18 lipid-PEG in serum-containing medium. It was observed that the addition of FBS could decrease the transfection efficacy of C18 LNPs while increasing the efficacy of C14 LNPs. The authors discussed these results, suggesting that the protein corona could either hinder the uptake process or facilitate it due to other receptor-mediated phenomenon [4]. Even if the protein corona has been described to inhibit transfection, it now appears that some of the proteins included in this corona could specifically interact with cellular processes and particles trafficking [2]. Regarding the results obtained in this study, it could then be hypothesized that C14 lipids-PEG dissociate in serum, which can facilitate transfection, as PEG is known to prevent the cellular uptake and endosomal escape processes [6]. Following this desorption, PEG could be replaced by a protein corona, which could also play a positive role on transfection, depending on its composition. In contrast, C18 lipids-PEG have strong anchoring ability which allows for the prevention of protein corona formation, but could also be an obstacle to transfection. Moreover, as explained by Chen et al., PEG cannot completely eliminate the binding of proteins around LNPs, and that proteins could impact the transfection in serum. \n\nSeveral parameters must then be considered when designing LNPs. The use of long lipids-PEG can offer an efficient protection against protein corona formation, prolong the circulation of LNPs, and increase the accumulation in tumor. Nevertheless, the transfection efficacy of these LNPs could finally be lower than expected because of the barrier effect of PEG. However, this effect could be balanced by an intermediate proportion of C18 lipid-PEG in LNPs formulations if an equilibrium between efficient stealth properties and efficient transfection can be found. On the other hand, recent examples highlighted the interest in using short lipids-PEG in order to avoid long effect or to target hepatic diseases. In that case, the formation of the protein corona is intended, and recent studies demonstrated the high transfection efficacy of these LNPs.",

As shown in Figure 3, after incubation in FBS, the particle size distribution profiles (concentration/size curves) were completely different depending on the lipid-PEG included in the LNPs. A flattening and displacement of the curves was observed for the DMG-and DTA-PEG (C14)-based formulations (Figure 3G-J), indicating an increase in the mean size and a decrease in the total particle concentration over time in the presence of FBS. The increase in the mean size was related to the adsorption of proteins around LNPs.

Berger, Manon Degey, Jeanne Leblond Chain, E. Maquoi, B. Evrard, A. Lechanteur, G. Piel\n## Abstract\nPolyethylene glycol (PEG) is used in Lipid Nanoparticles (LNPs) formulations to confer stealth properties and is traditionally anchored in membranes by a lipid moiety whose length significantly impacts the LNPs fate in vivo. C18 acyl chains are efficiently anchored in the membrane, while shorter C14 lipids are quickly desorbed and replaced by a protein corona responsible for the completely different fate of LNPs. In this context, a method to predict the biological behavior of LNPs depending on the lipid-PEG dissociation was developed using the Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA) method in serum. Two formulations of siRNA-containing LNPs were prepared including CSL3 or SM-102 lipids and were grafted with different lipids-PEG (C18, C14 lipids-PEG, and Ceramide-PEG). The impact of the lipid-PEG on the interactions between LNPs and serum components was demonstrated by monitoring the mean particle size and the concentration over time. In vitro, these formulations demonstrated low toxicity and efficient gene knockdown on tumor MDA-MB-231 cells, but serum was found to significantly impact the efficiency of C18-PEG-based LNPs, while it did not impact the efficiency of C14-PEG-based LNPs. The NTA method demonstrated the ability to discriminate between the behaviors of LNPs according to serum proteins\u2019 interactions. CSL3 lipid and Cer-PEG were confirmed to have promise for LNP formulation.\n## Evaluation of the Protein Corona Formation\nThe evolution of LNP size distribution profiles after incubation in fetal bovine serum (FBS) was measured by NTA in order to assess the formation of a protein corona around particles. Two main parameters were considered: the average size (Mean) and the concentration of total particles (LNPs at the initial time, LNPs and serum particles during the incubation). As shown in Figure 3, after incubation in FBS, the particle size distribution profiles (concentration/size curves) were completely different depending on the lipid-PEG included in the LNPs. A flattening and displacement of the curves was observed for the DMG-and DTA-PEG (C14)-based formulations (Figure 3G-J), indicating an increase in the mean size and a decrease in the total particle concentration over time in the presence of FBS. The increase in the mean size was related to the adsorption of proteins around LNPs. On the contrary, the DSPE-and DSG-PEG (C18)-based formulations (Figure 3A-D) did not show any flattening of their curves over time. These formulations were characterized by maintaining a constant average size with no decrease in concentration during incubation.\n\n## Discussion\nRecently, the transfection of HepG2 cells with LNPs also showed the impact of C18 lipid-PEG in serum-containing medium. It was observed that the addition of FBS could decrease the transfection efficacy of C18 LNPs while increasing the efficacy of C14 LNPs. The authors discussed these results, suggesting that the protein corona could either hinder the uptake process or facilitate it due to other receptor-mediated phenomenon [4]. Even if the protein corona has been described to inhibit transfection, it now appears that some of the proteins included in this corona could specifically interact with cellular processes and particles trafficking [2]. Regarding the results obtained in this study, it could then be hypothesized that C14 lipids-PEG dissociate in serum, which can facilitate transfection, as PEG is known to prevent the cellular uptake and endosomal escape processes [6]. Following this desorption, PEG could be replaced by a protein corona, which could also play a positive role on transfection, depending on its composition. In contrast, C18 lipids-PEG have strong anchoring ability which allows for the prevention of protein corona formation, but could also be an obstacle to transfection. Moreover, as explained by Chen et al., PEG cannot completely eliminate the binding of proteins around LNPs, and that proteins could impact the transfection in serum. \n\nSeveral parameters must then be considered when designing LNPs. The use of long lipids-PEG can offer an efficient protection against protein corona formation, prolong the circulation of LNPs, and increase the accumulation in tumor. Nevertheless, the transfection efficacy of these LNPs could finally be lower than expected because of the barrier effect of PEG. However, this effect could be balanced by an intermediate proportion of C18 lipid-PEG in LNPs formulations if an equilibrium between efficient stealth properties and efficient transfection can be found. On the other hand, recent examples highlighted the interest in using short lipids-PEG in order to avoid long effect or to target hepatic diseases. In that case, the formation of the protein corona is intended, and recent studies demonstrated the high transfection efficacy of these LNPs.\n...\nIn that case, the formation of the protein corona is intended, and recent studies demonstrated the high transfection efficacy of these LNPs. For further experiments, the CSL3 lipid may be more interesting considering that CSL3 LNPs showed higher siRNA encapsulation levels, lower toxicity and higher efficacy in tumor cells. Moreover, the use of Cer-PEG could be highly interesting due to the high efficacy of Cer-PEG LNPs in serum, and the intermediate results observed in terms of protein corona formation. It could then be a good compromise between stealth properties and gene silencing efficacy.",

In this Review, we provide an overview of the current state of protein corona research in nanomedicine. We next discuss remaining challenges in the research methodology and characterization of the protein corona that slow the development of nanoparticle therapeutics and diagnostics, and we address how artificial intelligence can advance protein corona research as a complement to experimental research efforts. We then review emerging opportunities provided by the protein corona to address major issues in healthcare and environmental sciences. This Review details how mechanistic insights into nanoparticle protein corona formation can broadly address unmet clinical and environmental needs, as well as enhance the safety and efficacy of nanobiotechnology products. Understanding the protein corona can advance nanomedicinal developments and elucidate how nanomaterials impact the environment. This Review discusses the evolution and challenges in characterizing the protein corona, explores how artificial intelligence can supplement experimental efforts and exposes emerging opportunities in nanomedicine and the environment.",

Additionally, the corona profile can be influenced by ambient factors such as biomolecule concentration 60 , pH 61 , ionic strength 62 , temperature 63 and incubation time [64][65][66] . Upon corona formation, the identity of the NP is transformed; its physicochemical properties 67 , targeting abilities 20,28,68 and biological responses 17,22,65,69 change owing to the surrogated biological identity dictated by the adsorbed proteins. For example, characterization of the protein corona on core-shell NPs, composed of identical PEGylated lipid bilayer shells with varying core elasticities, revealed that apolipoprotein A1 preferentially adsorbs onto NPs with intermediate elasticity and the adsorption strongly correlates with longer NP elasticity-dependent in vivo systemic circulation lifetimes 70 . \n\nTime-dependent profiling of protein coronas, extracted from human plasma, revealed that the formation of protein corona fingerprints occurs rapidly (~30 s), and the amount of protein in the corona, but not the composition of the protein profile, can change over time 71 . Moreover, the rapid formation of the protein corona impacts the kinetic pathophysiology of the NPs. For example, both an increased NP uptake by microvascular endothelial cells and the inhibition of erythrocyte haemolysis were observed upon protein corona formation 71 . The study of in situ protein corona formation in complex biological matrices, such as whole blood and plasma, showed that PEGylated gold NPs do not aggregate in these fluidic environments 72 . \n\nProtein coronas incorporate both soft and hard coronas. The soft corona, comprising biomolecules such as proteins with low affinities to NP surfaces, endures dynamic and reversible exchanges that are dependent on the conditions of the surrounding biological fluid 58,73,74 . The hard corona develops gradually, is more stable and is composed of 'relatively immobile' proteins with substantial affinities to, and low tendencies to dissociate from, NP surfaces 57,60,64 .",

Landry, Anna Moore, Roxana Coreas\n## Abstract\nThe protein corona spontaneously develops and evolves on the surface of nanoscale materials when they are exposed to biological environments, altering their physiochemical properties and affecting their subsequent interactions with biosystems. In this Review, we provide an overview of the current state of protein corona research in nanomedicine. We next discuss remaining challenges in the research methodology and characterization of the protein corona that slow the development of nanoparticle therapeutics and diagnostics, and we address how artificial intelligence can advance protein corona research as a complement to experimental research efforts. We then review emerging opportunities provided by the protein corona to address major issues in healthcare and environmental sciences. This Review details how mechanistic insights into nanoparticle protein corona formation can broadly address unmet clinical and environmental needs, as well as enhance the safety and efficacy of nanobiotechnology products. Understanding the protein corona can advance nanomedicinal developments and elucidate how nanomaterials impact the environment. This Review discusses the evolution and challenges in characterizing the protein corona, explores how artificial intelligence can supplement experimental efforts and exposes emerging opportunities in nanomedicine and the environment.\n## Soft and hard coronas\nNPs possess unique physiochemical properties 56 , such as size 57,58 , shape 59 and surface chemistries 19,57,60 , that can affect the formation of the protein corona. Additionally, the corona profile can be influenced by ambient factors such as biomolecule concentration 60 , pH 61 , ionic strength 62 , temperature 63 and incubation time [64][65][66] . Upon corona formation, the identity of the NP is transformed; its physicochemical properties 67 , targeting abilities 20,28,68 and biological responses 17,22,65,69 change owing to the surrogated biological identity dictated by the adsorbed proteins. For example, characterization of the protein corona on core-shell NPs, composed of identical PEGylated lipid bilayer shells with varying core elasticities, revealed that apolipoprotein A1 preferentially adsorbs onto NPs with intermediate elasticity and the adsorption strongly correlates with longer NP elasticity-dependent in vivo systemic circulation lifetimes 70 . \n\nTime-dependent profiling of protein coronas, extracted from human plasma, revealed that the formation of protein corona fingerprints occurs rapidly (~30 s), and the amount of protein in the corona, but not the composition of the protein profile, can change over time 71 . Moreover, the rapid formation of the protein corona impacts the kinetic pathophysiology of the NPs. For example, both an increased NP uptake by microvascular endothelial cells and the inhibition of erythrocyte haemolysis were observed upon protein corona formation 71 . The study of in situ protein corona formation in complex biological matrices, such as whole blood and plasma, showed that PEGylated gold NPs do not aggregate in these fluidic environments 72 . \n\nProtein coronas incorporate both soft and hard coronas. The soft corona, comprising biomolecules such as proteins with low affinities to NP surfaces, endures dynamic and reversible exchanges that are dependent on the conditions of the surrounding biological fluid 58,73,74 . The hard corona develops gradually, is more stable and is composed of 'relatively immobile' proteins with substantial affinities to, and low tendencies to dissociate from, NP surfaces 57,60,64 .",

            "abstract": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have shown promise as a delivery system for nucleic acid-based therapeutics, including DNA, siRNA, and mRNA vaccines. The immune system plays a critical role in the response to these nanocarriers, with innate immune cells initiating an early response and adaptive immune cells mediating a more specific reaction, sometimes leading to potential adverse effects. Recent studies have shown that the innate immune response to LNPs is mediated by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and other pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which recognize the lipid components of the nanoparticles. This recognition can trigger the activation of inflammatory pathways and the production of cytokines and chemokines, leading to potential adverse effects such as fever, inflammation, and pain at the injection site. On the other hand, the adaptive immune response to LNPs appears to be primarily directed against the protein encoded by the mRNA cargo, with little evidence of an ongoing adaptive immune response to the components of the LNP itself. Understanding the relationship between LNPs and the immune system is critical for the development of safe and effective nucleic acid-based delivery systems. In fact, targeting the immune system is essential to develop effective vaccines, as well as therapies against cancer or infections. There is a lack of research in the literature that has systematically studied the factors that influence the interaction between LNPs and the immune system and further research is needed to better elucidate the mechanisms underlying the immune response to LNPs. In this review, we discuss LNPs\u2019 composition, physico-chemical properties, such as size, shape, and surface charge, and the protein corona formation which can affect the reactivity of the immune system, thus providing a guide for the research on new formulations that could gain a favorable efficacy/safety profile.",

Reprinted with permission [38]. \n\nMoreover, studies have shown that upon IV administration PEG-lipid with short lipid tails tend to desorb from LNPs, inducing a change in surface structure that allows ApoE adsorption to LNPs, with the formation of a protein corona that affects their endosomal escape and mRNA release. ApoE in blood serum showed specificity for hepatocytes leading to LNP accumulation in the liver as exploited in Onpattro \u00ae formulation. In this product, the drug patisiran is delivered using LNPs composed of ionizable lipid (DLin-MC3-DMA), phosphatidylcholine derivate (DSPC), cholesterol, and PEG-lipid (PEG2000-C-DMG). Once the drug is administered into the systemic circulation, the PEG-lipid is replaced by serum proteins, mainly ApoE, which interact with the cholesterol component of the lipid complex and target the drug to the liver [117,118]. Furthermore, PEG-lipids can be functionalized with specific ligands such as folate for siRNA delivery or N-acetylgalactosamine for targeting liver hepatocytes [80]. \n\nFor instance, the addition of PEG or poloxamine coatings to NPs has been found to reduce complement activation, while dextran coatings increase it.

                    "text": "When NPs enter the bloodstream, some biomolecules interact with the LNP surface, resulting in their encapsulation and leading to the formation of a corona. This corona is commonly known as protein corona (PC) due to the predominant presence of plasma proteins [38]. The PC formation is a spontaneous process that occurs rapidly thanks to noncovalent interactions between proteins and the LNP surface [119]. \n\nThe presence of PC influences many properties of LNPs such as surface charge, hydrophilic and hydrophobic characteristics, stability, targeting ability, aggregation phenomena, toxicity, and efficacy, and, when RNA or DNA are loaded in LNPs, the PC affected also their transfection efficiency [120,121]. Data published on PC-coated LNPs seem to conflict with each other; in fact, many researchers observed a reduction in the targeting ability of nanoparticles after the PC formation [122], an increase in LNP aggregation, a decrease in LNP stability, and the leakage of fluorophores used for LNP tracking in vivo [123] (Figure 6), while other researchers suggested that the PC formation could be favorable to obtain a specific LNP targeting [1]. \n\nThe PC composition is principally affected by the physico-chemical properties and the biological environment of LNPs; it is also important to underline that the administration of the same LNP formulation to different patients could result in a different interaction of LNP-PC, specific for everyone (depending, as example, on pathological conditions, gender, age, and administration site) [124,125]. The study of the PC seems to be important to obtain a better LNP formulation able to induce the desirable pharmacological effect on each patient [126]. \n\nMany studies demonstrated that a careful selection of the technique (or techniques) used to separate LNPs and PC components is one of the key factors in obtaining realistic results. In particular, LNPs resulted in low-dense soft materials that are hardly separable from the serum nanomaterials, including exosomes and HDL [123,127,128].",

Catenacci, Rachele Rossi, Francesca Sechi, Daniela Buonocore, Milena Sorrenti, S. Perteghella, Marco Peviani, M. Bonferoni\n## Abstract\nLipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have shown promise as a delivery system for nucleic acid-based therapeutics, including DNA, siRNA, and mRNA vaccines. The immune system plays a critical role in the response to these nanocarriers, with innate immune cells initiating an early response and adaptive immune cells mediating a more specific reaction, sometimes leading to potential adverse effects. Recent studies have shown that the innate immune response to LNPs is mediated by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and other pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which recognize the lipid components of the nanoparticles. This recognition can trigger the activation of inflammatory pathways and the production of cytokines and chemokines, leading to potential adverse effects such as fever, inflammation, and pain at the injection site. On the other hand, the adaptive immune response to LNPs appears to be primarily directed against the protein encoded by the mRNA cargo, with little evidence of an ongoing adaptive immune response to the components of the LNP itself. Understanding the relationship between LNPs and the immune system is critical for the development of safe and effective nucleic acid-based delivery systems. In fact, targeting the immune system is essential to develop effective vaccines, as well as therapies against cancer or infections. There is a lack of research in the literature that has systematically studied the factors that influence the interaction between LNPs and the immune system and further research is needed to better elucidate the mechanisms underlying the immune response to LNPs. In this review, we discuss LNPs\u2019 composition, physico-chemical properties, such as size, shape, and surface charge, and the protein corona formation which can affect the reactivity of the immune system, thus providing a guide for the research on new formulations that could gain a favorable efficacy/safety profile.\n## PEG-Lipids\nThe illustration underscores the primary challenges and drawbacks associated with LNP vaccines. One significant opportunity lies in the ability to modify the protein corona composition, which can help mitigate off-target accumulation and enhance the interaction of LNPs with antigenpresenting cells and dendritic cells. This, in turn, has the potential to significantly improve vaccine efficacy. Reprinted with permission [38]. \n\nMoreover, studies have shown that upon IV administration PEG-lipid with short lipid tails tend to desorb from LNPs, inducing a change in surface structure that allows ApoE adsorption to LNPs, with the formation of a protein corona that affects their endosomal escape and mRNA release. ApoE in blood serum showed specificity for hepatocytes leading to LNP accumulation in the liver as exploited in Onpattro \u00ae formulation. In this product, the drug patisiran is delivered using LNPs composed of ionizable lipid (DLin-MC3-DMA), phosphatidylcholine derivate (DSPC), cholesterol, and PEG-lipid (PEG2000-C-DMG). Once the drug is administered into the systemic circulation, the PEG-lipid is replaced by serum proteins, mainly ApoE, which interact with the cholesterol component of the lipid complex and target the drug to the liver [117,118]. Furthermore, PEG-lipids can be functionalized with specific ligands such as folate for siRNA delivery or N-acetylgalactosamine for targeting liver hepatocytes [80]. \n\nFor instance, the addition of PEG or poloxamine coatings to NPs has been found to reduce complement activation, while dextran coatings increase it. Furthermore, Figure 6. The illustration underscores the primary challenges and drawbacks associated with LNP vaccines. One significant opportunity lies in the ability to modify the protein corona composition, which can help mitigate off-target accumulation and enhance the interaction of LNPs with antigenpresenting cells and dendritic cells. This, in turn, has the potential to significantly improve vaccine efficacy.

This corona is commonly known as protein corona (PC) due to the predominant presence of plasma proteins [38]. The PC formation is a spontaneous process that occurs rapidly thanks to noncovalent interactions between proteins and the LNP surface [119]. \n\nThe presence of PC influences many properties of LNPs such as surface charge, hydrophilic and hydrophobic characteristics, stability, targeting ability, aggregation phenomena, toxicity, and efficacy, and, when RNA or DNA are loaded in LNPs, the PC affected also their transfection efficiency [120,121]. Data published on PC-coated LNPs seem to conflict with each other; in fact, many researchers observed a reduction in the targeting ability of nanoparticles after the PC formation [122], an increase in LNP aggregation, a decrease in LNP stability, and the leakage of fluorophores used for LNP tracking in vivo [123] (Figure 6), while other researchers suggested that the PC formation could be favorable to obtain a specific LNP targeting [1]. \n\nThe PC composition is principally affected by the physico-chemical properties and the biological environment of LNPs; it is also important to underline that the administration of the same LNP formulation to different patients could result in a different interaction of LNP-PC, specific for everyone (depending, as example, on pathological conditions, gender, age, and administration site) [124,125]. The study of the PC seems to be important to obtain a better LNP formulation able to induce the desirable pharmacological effect on each patient [126]. \n\nMany studies demonstrated that a careful selection of the technique (or techniques) used to separate LNPs and PC components is one of the key factors in obtaining realistic results. In particular, LNPs resulted in low-dense soft materials that are hardly separable from the serum nanomaterials, including exosomes and HDL [123,127,128].",

The number of multifunctional NPs has increased in the market and hundreds of NPs are in various stages of preclinical and clinical development. Thus, the mechanism underlying the effects of NPs on biological systems has received much attention. After NPs enter the body, they interact with plasma proteins, tumour cell receptors, and small biological molecules. This interaction is closely related to the size, shape, chemical composition and surface modification properties of NPs. In this review, the effects of the size, shape, chemical composition and surface modification of NPs on the biological effects of NPs were summarised, including the mechanism through which NPs enter cells, the resulting oxidative stress response, and the interaction with proteins. This review of the biological effects of NPs can not only provide theoretical support for the preparation of safer and more efficient NPs but also lay the foundation for their clinical application.",

                    "text": "Also, due to differences in the surface modification of chemical groups, the formation and composition of the protein corona were different. Proteins quickly coated the surface of the original MWCNT and MWCNT-COOH and made them more compact than MWCNT-PEG, and these compact forms were more effective in protecting cells from the MWCNT surface. Further investigation showed that hydrophobicity was the main reason for the increase in the cellular uptake of the original MWCNTs. However, the protein corona filled with dysoposnins was the major reason for the low uptake of MWCNT-COOH in RAW264.7 cells. The protein corona on MWCNT reduced the exposure of the surface to the medium and limited interactions with cells. As a result, fewer ROS or inflammatory cytokines were produced. Hence, protein binding played a key role in reducing toxicity (Zhang et al., 2019). \n\nSome studies have also shown that the number and types of proteins adsorbed on the surface of NPs are closely related to the properties of NPs. Li et al. synthesised several NPs with similar shapes, sizes, and surface characteristics but different elasticity (45 kPa-760 MPa). After mixing these NPs with mouse plasma, they found that the composition of the protein corona formation changed non-monotonically with the increase in the elasticity of the NPs (Li et al., 2022). For example, apolipoprotein AI was more likely to form the corona protein over NPs of intermediate elasticity (75-700 kPa). Cheng et al. found that changing the components of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) can make LNPs absorb specific proteins in the blood and target specific organs (Cheng et al., 2020). \n\nThe research team undertook a study to ascertain the relationship between the ligand-protein corona and its biological effects, utilizing Pearson's correlation coefficient analysis. They delved into the impact of the protein corona on how particles are internalised and the subsequent macrophage immune response. \n\nTheir findings revealed that the surface chemistry of AuNRs played a role in determining the protein corona's composition.",

The nanotechnology industry is developing rapidly. The number of multifunctional NPs has increased in the market and hundreds of NPs are in various stages of preclinical and clinical development. Thus, the mechanism underlying the effects of NPs on biological systems has received much attention. After NPs enter the body, they interact with plasma proteins, tumour cell receptors, and small biological molecules. This interaction is closely related to the size, shape, chemical composition and surface modification properties of NPs. In this review, the effects of the size, shape, chemical composition and surface modification of NPs on the biological effects of NPs were summarised, including the mechanism through which NPs enter cells, the resulting oxidative stress response, and the interaction with proteins. This review of the biological effects of NPs can not only provide theoretical support for the preparation of safer and more efficient NPs but also lay the foundation for their clinical application.\n## Protein corona\nAlso, due to differences in the surface modification of chemical groups, the formation and composition of the protein corona were different. Proteins quickly coated the surface of the original MWCNT and MWCNT-COOH and made them more compact than MWCNT-PEG, and these compact forms were more effective in protecting cells from the MWCNT surface. Further investigation showed that hydrophobicity was the main reason for the increase in the cellular uptake of the original MWCNTs. However, the protein corona filled with dysoposnins was the major reason for the low uptake of MWCNT-COOH in RAW264.7 cells. The protein corona on MWCNT reduced the exposure of the surface to the medium and limited interactions with cells. As a result, fewer ROS or inflammatory cytokines were produced. Hence, protein binding played a key role in reducing toxicity (Zhang et al., 2019). \n\nSome studies have also shown that the number and types of proteins adsorbed on the surface of NPs are closely related to the properties of NPs. Li et al. synthesised several NPs with similar shapes, sizes, and surface characteristics but different elasticity (45 kPa-760 MPa). After mixing these NPs with mouse plasma, they found that the composition of the protein corona formation changed non-monotonically with the increase in the elasticity of the NPs (Li et al., 2022). For example, apolipoprotein AI was more likely to form the corona protein over NPs of intermediate elasticity (75-700 kPa). Cheng et al. found that changing the components of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) can make LNPs absorb specific proteins in the blood and target specific organs (Cheng et al., 2020). \n\nThe research team undertook a study to ascertain the relationship between the ligand-protein corona and its biological effects, utilizing Pearson's correlation coefficient analysis. They delved into the impact of the protein corona on how particles are internalised and the subsequent macrophage immune response. \n\nTheir findings revealed that the surface chemistry of AuNRs played a role in determining the protein corona's composition.",

            "abstract": "Macrophages are multifunctional innate immune cells that play indispensable roles in homeostasis, tissue repair, and immune regulation. However, dysregulated activation of macrophages is implicated in the pathogenesis of various human disorders, making them a potential target for treatment. Through the expression of pattern recognition and scavenger receptors, macrophages exhibit selective uptake of pathogens and apoptotic cells. Consequently, the utilization of drug carriers that mimic pathogenic or apoptotic signals shows potential for targeted delivery to macrophages. In this study, a series of mannosylated or/and phosphatidylserine (PS) -presenting liposomes were developed to target macrophages via the design of experiment (DoE) strategy and the trial-and-error (TaE) approach. The optimal molar ratio for the liposome formulation was DOPC: DSPS: Chol: PEG-PE\u2009=\u200920:60:20:2 based on the results of cellular uptake and cytotoxicity evaluation on RAW 264.7 and THP-1 in vitro. Results from in vivo distribution showed that, in the DSS-induced colitis model and collagen II-induced rheumatoid arthritis model, PS-presenting liposomes (PS-Lipo) showed the highest accumulation in intestine and paws respectively, which holds promising potential for macrophage target therapy since macrophages are abundant at inflammatory sites and contribute to the progression of corresponding diseases. Organs such as the heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney did not exhibit histological alterations such as inflammation or necrosis when exposed to PC-presenting liposomes (PC-Lipo) or PS-Lipo. In addition, liposomes demonstrated hemobiocompatibility and no toxicity to liver or kidney for circulation and did not induce metabolic injury in the animals. Thus, the well-designed PS-Lipo demonstrated the most potential for macrophage target therapy.

In a recent study, Le ND et al. synthesized a series of poly(\u03b2-amino ester) (PBAE) derivatives and found that the protein corona on nanoparticles could help achieve organ targeting (lungs and spleen) [32]. Interestingly, their findings correlated closely with the study of Min Qiu et al. [33] , which demonstrated that the protein corona on lung-targeted nanoparticles had distinct characteristics that promoted lung accumulation. The protein corona formed on the surface of liposomes is primarily influenced by the physicochemical properties of the liposomes themselves. By selecting different lipid components or varying their ratios, it is possible to achieve targeting of different organs or cells. In 2020, Daniel Siegwart et al. reported a Selective Organ Targeting (SORT) delivery technology [34]. They introduced the cationic lipid DOTAP as a fifth component to the formulation 5A2-SC8/DOPE/DMG-PEG2000/Cholesterol, thereby altering the physicochemical properties of the LNPs, including their zeta potential. This modification influenced the formation of the protein corona during blood circulation, enabling intravenous delivery of mRNA to the lungs. Recently, Daniel Siegwart's team reporting the use of Lung SORT LNPs for delivering ABE mRNA/sgRNA to perform gene editing on lung stem cells, treating pulmonary cystic fibrosis [35]. These findings highlight the complexity and potential of manipulating nanoparticle properties and their protein corona to achieve targeted delivery to specific organs, including the lungs. Therefore, one promising avenue involves the introduction of cationic lipids into the liposomal formulation, which may introduce a more balanced surface charge to achieve lung-targeting. However, the exact mechanisms and optimal strategies require further investigation to enhance the efficacy of lung-targeted liposomal delivery systems. \n\nIn addition, pharmacokinetic experiment was conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetic profiles of PC-Lipo and PS-Lipo in mice. As shown in Fig. 5C, PS-Lipo exhibited a faster metabolic rate compared to PC-Lipo.",

However, dysregulated activation of macrophages is implicated in the pathogenesis of various human disorders, making them a potential target for treatment. Through the expression of pattern recognition and scavenger receptors, macrophages exhibit selective uptake of pathogens and apoptotic cells. Consequently, the utilization of drug carriers that mimic pathogenic or apoptotic signals shows potential for targeted delivery to macrophages. In this study, a series of mannosylated or/and phosphatidylserine (PS) -presenting liposomes were developed to target macrophages via the design of experiment (DoE) strategy and the trial-and-error (TaE) approach. The optimal molar ratio for the liposome formulation was DOPC: DSPS: Chol: PEG-PE\u2009=\u200920:60:20:2 based on the results of cellular uptake and cytotoxicity evaluation on RAW 264.7 and THP-1 in vitro. Results from in vivo distribution showed that, in the DSS-induced colitis model and collagen II-induced rheumatoid arthritis model, PS-presenting liposomes (PS-Lipo) showed the highest accumulation in intestine and paws respectively, which holds promising potential for macrophage target therapy since macrophages are abundant at inflammatory sites and contribute to the progression of corresponding diseases. Organs such as the heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney did not exhibit histological alterations such as inflammation or necrosis when exposed to PC-presenting liposomes (PC-Lipo) or PS-Lipo. In addition, liposomes demonstrated hemobiocompatibility and no toxicity to liver or kidney for circulation and did not induce metabolic injury in the animals. Thus, the well-designed PS-Lipo demonstrated the most potential for macrophage target therapy.

In a recent study, Le ND et al. synthesized a series of poly(\u03b2-amino ester) (PBAE) derivatives and found that the protein corona on nanoparticles could help achieve organ targeting (lungs and spleen) [32]. Interestingly, their findings correlated closely with the study of Min Qiu et al. [33] , which demonstrated that the protein corona on lung-targeted nanoparticles had distinct characteristics that promoted lung accumulation. The protein corona formed on the surface of liposomes is primarily influenced by the physicochemical properties of the liposomes themselves. By selecting different lipid components or varying their ratios, it is possible to achieve targeting of different organs or cells. In 2020, Daniel Siegwart et al. reported a Selective Organ Targeting (SORT) delivery technology [34]. They introduced the cationic lipid DOTAP as a fifth component to the formulation 5A2-SC8/DOPE/DMG-PEG2000/Cholesterol, thereby altering the physicochemical properties of the LNPs, including their zeta potential. This modification influenced the formation of the protein corona during blood circulation, enabling intravenous delivery of mRNA to the lungs. Recently, Daniel Siegwart's team reporting the use of Lung SORT LNPs for delivering ABE mRNA/sgRNA to perform gene editing on lung stem cells, treating pulmonary cystic fibrosis [35]. These findings highlight the complexity and potential of manipulating nanoparticle properties and their protein corona to achieve targeted delivery to specific organs, including the lungs. Therefore, one promising avenue involves the introduction of cationic lipids into the liposomal formulation, which may introduce a more balanced surface charge to achieve lung-targeting. However, the exact mechanisms and optimal strategies require further investigation to enhance the efficacy of lung-targeted liposomal delivery systems. \n\nIn addition, pharmacokinetic experiment was conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetic profiles of PC-Lipo and PS-Lipo in mice. As shown in Fig. 5C, PS-Lipo exhibited a faster metabolic rate compared to PC-Lipo.",

Yet, the ability of LNPs to effectively encapsulate large-size DNA molecules remains elusive. This is a significant limitation, as the successful delivery of large-size DNA holds immense potential for gene therapy. To address this gap, the present study focuses on the design of PEGylated LNPs, incorporating large-sized DNA, departing from traditional RNA and ionizable lipids. The resultant LNPs demonstrate a unique particle morphology. These particles were further engineered with a DNA coating and plasma proteins. This multicomponent bionanoconstruct exhibits enhanced transfection efficiency and safety in controlled laboratory settings and improved immune system evasion in in vivo tests. These findings provide valuable insights for the design and development of bionanoarchitectures for large-size DNA delivery, opening new avenues for transformative gene therapies.",

                    "text": "The stability of an artificial protein corona in a protein-rich environment (such as the bloodstream and the cytoplasm) is a key requirement for its effectiveness. This is because the corona stability influences its ability to maintain its composition and structure over time 1,2 . In a protein-rich environment, various proteins are present that can potentially interact with the corona. If the corona is not stable, it may undergo structural changes or disintegrate, leading to alterations in its composition. This can have significant implications for the corona's functionality, including its ability to influence interactions between the NP and biological systems. As an example, Qin et al. 3 demonstrated that an intracellular protein corona (IPC) can form on nanoparticles once they are taken up by cells. This IPC has the potential to significantly impact the intracellular transport network of these NPs. A stable protein corona is therefore crucial for maintaining the specific interactions and properties that were designed or intended. It helps ensure that the corona continues to serve its intended purpose, whether it is to enhance biocompatibility, modulate cellular uptake by engaging specific receptors, or influence other aspects of nanoparticle behavior. \n\nFor this purpose, we prepared coronated LNP and LNPi at different plasma percentages. Each batch was aliquoted into two portions. The first represents the formulation as synthesized in the laboratory, constituting the system ready for in vivo applications. This batch was kept as is for 1 hour at 37 \u00b0C. Simultaneously, the second batch was exposed to 50% HP, i.e., the percentage of plasma commonly used in literature to mimic the injection of NPs into the circulatory system. Finally, we employed SDS-PAGE to compare the corona composition of coronated LNP and LNPi before and after plasma exposure (the electrophoretic gel is shown in Supplementary Figure 6a). First, we observe that the electrophoretic profiles of coronated LNP (light gray) change as a function of protein concentration. This first observation is in line with previous results obtained with lipid gene vectors 4 , and other NP types 5 . After exposure to 50% high protein concentration (depicted in dark grey), LNP displayed very similar protein profiles.",

Caracciolo\n## Abstract\nLipid nanoparticles (LNPs) play a crucial role in addressing genetic disorders, and cancer, and combating pandemics such as COVID-19 and its variants. Yet, the ability of LNPs to effectively encapsulate large-size DNA molecules remains elusive. This is a significant limitation, as the successful delivery of large-size DNA holds immense potential for gene therapy. To address this gap, the present study focuses on the design of PEGylated LNPs, incorporating large-sized DNA, departing from traditional RNA and ionizable lipids. The resultant LNPs demonstrate a unique particle morphology. These particles were further engineered with a DNA coating and plasma proteins. This multicomponent bionanoconstruct exhibits enhanced transfection efficiency and safety in controlled laboratory settings and improved immune system evasion in in vivo tests. These findings provide valuable insights for the design and development of bionanoarchitectures for large-size DNA delivery, opening new avenues for transformative gene therapies.\n## Protein Corona Stability in Excess Protein Conditions.\nThe stability of an artificial protein corona in a protein-rich environment (such as the bloodstream and the cytoplasm) is a key requirement for its effectiveness. This is because the corona stability influences its ability to maintain its composition and structure over time 1,2 . In a protein-rich environment, various proteins are present that can potentially interact with the corona. If the corona is not stable, it may undergo structural changes or disintegrate, leading to alterations in its composition. This can have significant implications for the corona's functionality, including its ability to influence interactions between the NP and biological systems. As an example, Qin et al. 3 demonstrated that an intracellular protein corona (IPC) can form on nanoparticles once they are taken up by cells. This IPC has the potential to significantly impact the intracellular transport network of these NPs. A stable protein corona is therefore crucial for maintaining the specific interactions and properties that were designed or intended. It helps ensure that the corona continues to serve its intended purpose, whether it is to enhance biocompatibility, modulate cellular uptake by engaging specific receptors, or influence other aspects of nanoparticle behavior. \n\nFor this purpose, we prepared coronated LNP and LNPi at different plasma percentages. Each batch was aliquoted into two portions. The first represents the formulation as synthesized in the laboratory, constituting the system ready for in vivo applications. This batch was kept as is for 1 hour at 37 \u00b0C. Simultaneously, the second batch was exposed to 50% HP, i.e., the percentage of plasma commonly used in literature to mimic the injection of NPs into the circulatory system. Finally, we employed SDS-PAGE to compare the corona composition of coronated LNP and LNPi before and after plasma exposure (the electrophoretic gel is shown in Supplementary Figure 6a). First, we observe that the electrophoretic profiles of coronated LNP (light gray) change as a function of protein concentration. This first observation is in line with previous results obtained with lipid gene vectors 4 , and other NP types 5 . After exposure to 50% high protein concentration (depicted in dark grey), LNP displayed very similar protein profiles.",

The recent success of mRNA vaccines for combating the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the medical value of RNA drugs. However, one of the major challenges in realizing the full potential of RNA drugs is to deliver RNA into specific organs and tissues in a targeted manner, which is crucial for achieving therapeutic efficacy, reducing side effects, and enhancing overall treatment efficacy. Numerous attempts have been made to pursue targeting, nonetheless, the lack of clear guideline and commonality elucidation has hindered the clinical translation of RNA drugs. In this review, we outline the mechanisms of action for targeted RNA delivery systems and summarize four key factors that influence the targeting delivery of RNA drugs. These factors include the category of vector materials, chemical structures of vectors, administration routes, and physicochemical properties of RNA vectors, and they all notably contribute to specific organ/tissue tropism. Furthermore, we provide an overview of the main RNA-based drugs that are currently in clinical trials, highlighting their design strategies and tissue tropism applications. This review will aid to understand the principles and mechanisms of targeted delivery systems, accelerating the development of future RNA drugs for different diseases.",

Upon intravenous injection, the nanoparticles come into contact with the serum, leading proteins to adsorb on their surface and form a distinctive protein corona layer [121]. The presence of the protein corona may alter the properties of the nanoparticles, with profound influences for their tissue specificity. For instance, most LNPs exhibit hepatic specificity via intravenous administration, owing to the adsorption of ApoE by binding to the LDLR that are over-expressed on the hepatocytes [121]. Additionally, it has been validated that the knockdown of ApoE lowered the liver targeting of nanomaterials by delivering mRNA into a mouse model lacking ApoE expression [121]. Although the mechanism of endogenous targeting is still not fully explored, researchers have striven to investigate the rules. It is discovered that when the PEG-lipids desorb from LNPs, specific protein binding to LNPs is promoted. The desorption rate of PEG-lipids with longer hydrophobic chains is slower, which might not conducive to formulating appropriate protein coronas and achieving organ targeted delivery [121]. In parallel, nano-vectors with different structures and properties may adsorb different proteins, resulting in protein coronas with distinct components and properties. The formation of protein corona at the interface will alter the physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles, exhibiting a crucial impact on their biodistribution and endocytosis [162]. It has been demonstrated that LNPs with different pKa values can influence their organ targeting. More specifically, the preferred pK a range for liver, spleen, and lung targeting is 6.2~6.5, 2~6, and 7~9, respectively [121,174,175]. These theories have implications for guiding the design of other delivery systems as well.",

The recent success of mRNA vaccines for combating the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the medical value of RNA drugs. However, one of the major challenges in realizing the full potential of RNA drugs is to deliver RNA into specific organs and tissues in a targeted manner, which is crucial for achieving therapeutic efficacy, reducing side effects, and enhancing overall treatment efficacy. Numerous attempts have been made to pursue targeting, nonetheless, the lack of clear guideline and commonality elucidation has hindered the clinical translation of RNA drugs. In this review, we outline the mechanisms of action for targeted RNA delivery systems and summarize four key factors that influence the targeting delivery of RNA drugs. These factors include the category of vector materials, chemical structures of vectors, administration routes, and physicochemical properties of RNA vectors, and they all notably contribute to specific organ/tissue tropism. Furthermore, we provide an overview of the main RNA-based drugs that are currently in clinical trials, highlighting their design strategies and tissue tropism applications. This review will aid to understand the principles and mechanisms of targeted delivery systems, accelerating the development of future RNA drugs for different diseases.\n## Protein corona\nThe formation of protein coronas is believed to be closely associated with the biodistribution of nanoparticles in the body. Upon intravenous injection, the nanoparticles come into contact with the serum, leading proteins to adsorb on their surface and form a distinctive protein corona layer [121]. The presence of the protein corona may alter the properties of the nanoparticles, with profound influences for their tissue specificity. For instance, most LNPs exhibit hepatic specificity via intravenous administration, owing to the adsorption of ApoE by binding to the LDLR that are over-expressed on the hepatocytes [121]. Additionally, it has been validated that the knockdown of ApoE lowered the liver targeting of nanomaterials by delivering mRNA into a mouse model lacking ApoE expression [121]. Although the mechanism of endogenous targeting is still not fully explored, researchers have striven to investigate the rules. It is discovered that when the PEG-lipids desorb from LNPs, specific protein binding to LNPs is promoted. The desorption rate of PEG-lipids with longer hydrophobic chains is slower, which might not conducive to formulating appropriate protein coronas and achieving organ targeted delivery [121]. In parallel, nano-vectors with different structures and properties may adsorb different proteins, resulting in protein coronas with distinct components and properties. The formation of protein corona at the interface will alter the physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles, exhibiting a crucial impact on their biodistribution and endocytosis [162]. It has been demonstrated that LNPs with different pKa values can influence their organ targeting. More specifically, the preferred pK a range for liver, spleen, and lung targeting is 6.2~6.5, 2~6, and 7~9, respectively [121,174,175]. These theories have implications for guiding the design of other delivery systems as well.",

Varying degrees of heterogeneity in mRNA-LNPs can affect their biophysical and functional properties. Given the profound complexity of mRNA-LNPs, it is critical to develop comprehensive and orthogonal analytical techniques for a better understanding of these formulations. To this end, we developed a robust ultracentrifugation method for density-based separation of subpopulations of mRNA-LNPs. Four LNP formulations encapsulating human erythropoietin (hEPO) with varying functionalities were synthesized using two ionizable lipids, A and B, and two helper lipids, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) and 1,2-dierucoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DEPE), along with cholesterol and DMG-PEG-2K. Upon ultracentrifugation on a sucrose gradient, a distinct pattern of \u201cfractions\u201d was observed across the gradient, from the less dense topmost fraction to the increasingly denser bottom fractions, which were harvested for comprehensive analyses. Parent LNPs, A-DOPE and B-DOPE, were resolved into three density-based fractions, each differing significantly in the hEPO expression following intravenous and intramuscular routes of administration. Parent B-DEPE LNPs resolved into two density-based fractions, with most of the payload and lipid content being attributed to the topmost fraction compared to the lower one, indicating some degree of heterogeneity, while parent A-DEPE LNPs showed remarkable homogeneity, as indicated by comparable in vivo potency, lipid numbers, and particle count among the three density-based fractions. This study is the first to demonstrate the application of density gradient-based ultracentrifugation (DGC) for a head-to-head comparison of heterogeneity as a function of biological performance and biophysical characteristics of parent mRNA-LNPs and their subpopulations.",

For lipid A, formulations made with DEPE showed higher hEPO expression than those made with DOPE for both IV and IM routes of administration (p < 0.05, Figure 2A,B). On the other hand, for lipid B, LNPs made with DEPE showed higher hEPO levels over B-DOPE LNPs only for IV (p < 0.05) but not for the IM dosing route (Figure 2C,D). \n\nIn the context of systemic delivery, LNPs in circulation undergo dynamic interactions with serum proteins forming a protein corona, which has significant implications on the kinetics, interactions, and affinity of the LNPs with different cell types. 24 Composition and formulation changes in LNPs can alter the protein corona, thereby modulating LNP\u2212cell interactions. 25 For instance, the binding of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) affects LNP uptake by hepatocytes through the lowdensity lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). PC-and PE-based helper lipids formulated into LNPs can differentially influence their ApoE adsorption and thus hepatic delivery. 13 Recently, Zhou et al. demonstrated efficient dendritic cell (DC) uptake of ApoE3-incorporated biomimetic nanoparticles through the macropinocytosis pathway for cancer immunotherapy. 26 In this work, we observed that incorporating PE-based helper lipids with differing tail lengths into LNPs resulted in significant differences in their potencies through different routes of delivery. To investigate if these differences could be attributed to differential ApoE binding, the four LNPs were evaluated for their ApoE affinity using a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D). The dissipation and frequency shifts of all four sensors were monitored in real time (Figure 2E\u2212G).",

Karve, Frank DeRosa\n## Abstract\nRational design and robust formulation processes are critical for optimal delivery of mRNA by lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). Varying degrees of heterogeneity in mRNA-LNPs can affect their biophysical and functional properties. Given the profound complexity of mRNA-LNPs, it is critical to develop comprehensive and orthogonal analytical techniques for a better understanding of these formulations. To this end, we developed a robust ultracentrifugation method for density-based separation of subpopulations of mRNA-LNPs. Four LNP formulations encapsulating human erythropoietin (hEPO) with varying functionalities were synthesized using two ionizable lipids, A and B, and two helper lipids, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) and 1,2-dierucoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DEPE), along with cholesterol and DMG-PEG-2K. Upon ultracentrifugation on a sucrose gradient, a distinct pattern of \u201cfractions\u201d was observed across the gradient, from the less dense topmost fraction to the increasingly denser bottom fractions, which were harvested for comprehensive analyses. Parent LNPs, A-DOPE and B-DOPE, were resolved into three density-based fractions, each differing significantly in the hEPO expression following intravenous and intramuscular routes of administration. Parent B-DEPE LNPs resolved into two density-based fractions, with most of the payload and lipid content being attributed to the topmost fraction compared to the lower one, indicating some degree of heterogeneity, while parent A-DEPE LNPs showed remarkable homogeneity, as indicated by comparable in vivo potency, lipid numbers, and particle count among the three density-based fractions. This study is the first to demonstrate the application of density gradient-based ultracentrifugation (DGC) for a head-to-head comparison of heterogeneity as a function of biological performance and biophysical characteristics of parent mRNA-LNPs and their subpopulations.\n## \u25a0 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nFor both IV and IM dosing, LNPs made with lipids A and B, irrespective of the helper lipids used, showed significantly higher hEPO levels over the MC3 control (p < 0.005, Figure 2A\u2212D). For lipid A, formulations made with DEPE showed higher hEPO expression than those made with DOPE for both IV and IM routes of administration (p < 0.05, Figure 2A,B). On the other hand, for lipid B, LNPs made with DEPE showed higher hEPO levels over B-DOPE LNPs only for IV (p < 0.05) but not for the IM dosing route (Figure 2C,D). \n\nIn the context of systemic delivery, LNPs in circulation undergo dynamic interactions with serum proteins forming a protein corona, which has significant implications on the kinetics, interactions, and affinity of the LNPs with different cell types. 24 Composition and formulation changes in LNPs can alter the protein corona, thereby modulating LNP\u2212cell interactions. 25 For instance, the binding of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) affects LNP uptake by hepatocytes through the lowdensity lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). PC-and PE-based helper lipids formulated into LNPs can differentially influence their ApoE adsorption and thus hepatic delivery. 13 Recently, Zhou et al. demonstrated efficient dendritic cell (DC) uptake of ApoE3-incorporated biomimetic nanoparticles through the macropinocytosis pathway for cancer immunotherapy. 26 In this work, we observed that incorporating PE-based helper lipids with differing tail lengths into LNPs resulted in significant differences in their potencies through different routes of delivery. To investigate if these differences could be attributed to differential ApoE binding, the four LNPs were evaluated for their ApoE affinity using a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D). The dissipation and frequency shifts of all four sensors were monitored in real time (Figure 2E\u2212G).",

            "text": "Thus, the formation of protein corona and its impacts are considered one of the keystones to the gap between in vitro design and in vivo therapeutic effect. \n\nThus, there is a pressing need for the understanding of protein-NPs interactions to control the formation of protein corona. Several articles have suggested that the protein-NPs interactions are associated with the physicochemical properties of the NPs and the media 19,20 . To control the formation of protein corona, the directional modification of the physicochemical properties of the NPs is an effective strategy. The modifications of surface charge, hydrophobicity and morphology of NPs are complicated and costly, which makes the NPs even harder for industrialization 21 . Compared to other properties of NPs, the control of NPs size is the most mature and commonly used methods during NPs designing. Besides, the medium pH of the lesion varies with the disease type and condition. Hence, the medium pH is considered one of the key factors during the protein corona formation of NPs. \n\nA series of articles have been reported to illustrate the effect of particle size or media pH on protein corona formation in gold NPs 22e24 , silica NPs 25,26 and polymeric NPs 27 . It was suggested that the amount and types of adsorption protein were significantly affected by these factors. However, the systemic studies about the interaction between solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) and protein are still missing. The conclusions or experiences obtained from the previous studies are not sufficient for comprehensive understanding the protein corona formation of SLNs. Unlike inorganic NPs, SLNs is a lipid-based nanocarrier which bears a core-shell structure: a hydrophilic surfactant shell and a hydrophobic lipid core. In the past decades, SLNs was widely employed in the treatment of colon cancer 28 , cystic fibrosis 29 , bacterial infection 30 , sepsis 31 , etc., and great therapeutic effects were shown in these studies. Compared to metal or polymeric NPs, the clinical transformation of SLNs is also more promising for its simple and low-cost production process, high biocompatibility and excellent drug loading capacity. When the administrated SLNs absorbed into plasma and most human organs, they are exposed to near-neutral pH environment.",

            "text": "Changes in the surface properties of LNPs may compromise the stability of RNA-LNPs through corona. 25 It has been demonstrated that by designing novel ionizable lipids (ILs) and optimizing LNPs formulations, the type of proteins adsorbed onto the LNPs surface can be influenced, thereby achieving organ-specific delivery. 137 However, although targeting strategies designed via formulation optimization often result in preferential uptake by certain organs, achieving a high level of target cell specificity is rarely realized. Moreover, the roles of different formulations in differential biological distribution, as well as the general relationship between lipid structure, formulation, and activity, are areas that require further exploration. 122 iScience Review Figure 6. Representative chemical structures of key lipids designed for organ-selective nucleic acids delivery Proteins from plasma are adsorbed onto the LNPs surface to form a protein corona in the blood circulation. The protein corona formed on LNPs after intravenous injection contains hundreds of biomolecules (mainly proteins and lipids). LNPs are cleared and extravasated from the circulation, and ultimately function intracellularly via cellular uptake and undergo organ, cellular, and molecular biological processes. 138 The composition of the protein corona is influenced by the chemical and molecular components of the surface of the LNPs, as well as its charge. This formation of protein coronas allows the fate of LNPs in vivo to be predicted, and even the targeting ligands can be shielded so that LNPs can be delivered less efficiently. Thus, understanding protein corona can help in the design of novel targeted LNPs. 20 sually, the formation of protein corona reduces the delivery efficiency of LNPs, and encapsulation of LNPs on the surface with PEG or other materials usually inhibits the formation of protein corona and prolongs the blood circulation of LNPs. 139 Recent studies have shown that apolipoproteins can be incorporated into protein corona, exerting endogenous targeting properties and playing an important role in organ-and cell-specific targeting of LNPs. 140",

            "text": "When NPs enter the bloodstream, some biomolecules interact with the LNP surface, resulting in their encapsulation and leading to the formation of a corona. This corona is commonly known as protein corona (PC) due to the predominant presence of plasma proteins [38]. The PC formation is a spontaneous process that occurs rapidly thanks to noncovalent interactions between proteins and the LNP surface [119]. \n\nThe presence of PC influences many properties of LNPs such as surface charge, hydrophilic and hydrophobic characteristics, stability, targeting ability, aggregation phenomena, toxicity, and efficacy, and, when RNA or DNA are loaded in LNPs, the PC affected also their transfection efficiency [120,121]. Data published on PC-coated LNPs seem to conflict with each other; in fact, many researchers observed a reduction in the targeting ability of nanoparticles after the PC formation [122], an increase in LNP aggregation, a decrease in LNP stability, and the leakage of fluorophores used for LNP tracking in vivo [123] (Figure 6), while other researchers suggested that the PC formation could be favorable to obtain a specific LNP targeting [1]. \n\nThe PC composition is principally affected by the physico-chemical properties and the biological environment of LNPs; it is also important to underline that the administration of the same LNP formulation to different patients could result in a different interaction of LNP-PC, specific for everyone (depending, as example, on pathological conditions, gender, age, and administration site) [124,125]. The study of the PC seems to be important to obtain a better LNP formulation able to induce the desirable pharmacological effect on each patient [126]. \n\nMany studies demonstrated that a careful selection of the technique (or techniques) used to separate LNPs and PC components is one of the key factors in obtaining realistic results. In particular, LNPs resulted in low-dense soft materials that are hardly separable from the serum nanomaterials, including exosomes and HDL [123,127,128].",

The formation of a hard corona, a set of strongly bound biomolecules on the surface of NPs, is a possible source of interfering effects and adverse reactions in biological environments.\n\nThe protein corona has been indeed reported to affect cell interactions and the targeting selectivity of nanoparticles. 48 In addition, some NP-bound proteins could favor inflammatory or procoagulant effects and the clearance by RES macrophages, especially the liver Kupfer cells. 49 According to the most recent literature, polymer coating in many cases does not prevent protein binding, but controls the selective recruitment of a small pool of proteins that are, in turn, responsible for the nanoparticle's properties. 50\u221253 The protein corona formed on our nanoparticles was investigated using SDS-PAGE analysis followed by sensitive silver staining.

            "text": "The stability of an artificial protein corona in a protein-rich environment (such as the bloodstream and the cytoplasm) is a key requirement for its effectiveness. This is because the corona stability influences its ability to maintain its composition and structure over time 1,2 . In a protein-rich environment, various proteins are present that can potentially interact with the corona. If the corona is not stable, it may undergo structural changes or disintegrate, leading to alterations in its composition. This can have significant implications for the corona's functionality, including its ability to influence interactions between the NP and biological systems. As an example, Qin et al. 3 demonstrated that an intracellular protein corona (IPC) can form on nanoparticles once they are taken up by cells. This IPC has the potential to significantly impact the intracellular transport network of these NPs. A stable protein corona is therefore crucial for maintaining the specific interactions and properties that were designed or intended. It helps ensure that the corona continues to serve its intended purpose, whether it is to enhance biocompatibility, modulate cellular uptake by engaging specific receptors, or influence other aspects of nanoparticle behavior. \n\nFor this purpose, we prepared coronated LNP and LNPi at different plasma percentages. Each batch was aliquoted into two portions. The first represents the formulation as synthesized in the laboratory, constituting the system ready for in vivo applications. This batch was kept as is for 1 hour at 37 \u00b0C. Simultaneously, the second batch was exposed to 50% HP, i.e., the percentage of plasma commonly used in literature to mimic the injection of NPs into the circulatory system. Finally, we employed SDS-PAGE to compare the corona composition of coronated LNP and LNPi before and after plasma exposure (the electrophoretic gel is shown in Supplementary Figure 6a). First, we observe that the electrophoretic profiles of coronated LNP (light gray) change as a function of protein concentration. This first observation is in line with previous results obtained with lipid gene vectors 4 , and other NP types 5 . After exposure to 50% high protein concentration (depicted in dark grey), LNP displayed very similar protein profiles.",

            "text": "The formation of protein coronas is believed to be closely associated with the biodistribution of nanoparticles in the body. Upon intravenous injection, the nanoparticles come into contact with the serum, leading proteins to adsorb on their surface and form a distinctive protein corona layer [121]. The presence of the protein corona may alter the properties of the nanoparticles, with profound influences for their tissue specificity. For instance, most LNPs exhibit hepatic specificity via intravenous administration, owing to the adsorption of ApoE by binding to the LDLR that are over-expressed on the hepatocytes [121]. Additionally, it has been validated that the knockdown of ApoE lowered the liver targeting of nanomaterials by delivering mRNA into a mouse model lacking ApoE expression [121]. Although the mechanism of endogenous targeting is still not fully explored, researchers have striven to investigate the rules. It is discovered that when the PEG-lipids desorb from LNPs, specific protein binding to LNPs is promoted. The desorption rate of PEG-lipids with longer hydrophobic chains is slower, which might not conducive to formulating appropriate protein coronas and achieving organ targeted delivery [121]. In parallel, nano-vectors with different structures and properties may adsorb different proteins, resulting in protein coronas with distinct components and properties. The formation of protein corona at the interface will alter the physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles, exhibiting a crucial impact on their biodistribution and endocytosis [162]. It has been demonstrated that LNPs with different pKa values can influence their organ targeting. More specifically, the preferred pK a range for liver, spleen, and lung targeting is 6.2~6.5, 2~6, and 7~9, respectively [121,174,175]. These theories have implications for guiding the design of other delivery systems as well.",

Biological fluids have complex compositions and the molecular components interact and function together in intricate networks. Therefore, the process to isolate blood or the preparation of blood derivatives may lead to differences in the composition of the identified protein corona around nanoparticles. Here, we show distinct differences in the protein corona formed in whole blood, whole blood with EDTA, plasma, or serum. Furthermore, the ratio between particle surface area to protein concentration influences the detected corona. We also show that the nanoparticle size per se influences the formed protein corona due to curvature effects. These results emphasize the need of investigating the formation and biological importance of the protein corona in the same environment as the nanoparticles are intended for or released into.",

            "text": "It is vital to claim the biological fate of nanoparticles. \n\nRecently, evidence accumulates that protein corona has a great impact on the biological fate of nanoparticles [16][17][18][19][20][21][22]. Protein corona is a corona-like supramolecular structure formed around the surface of nanoparticles upon contact with biological fluids [23]. There are numerous types of proteins in biological fluids, which renders the composition of protein corona very complicated [24]. The formation of protein corona alters the surface chemistry of nanoparticles, i.e., change from the nanoparticulate coating layer into protein complex [25]. It is established that the surface chemistry of xenobiotics determines the cellular recognition and uptake processes [26]. Thus, protein corona will affect the cellular recognition and uptake of nanoparticles [27], and even the inflammatory [28] and cytotoxic pathways [29]. As to nanoparticles for drug delivery, premature cargo release may occur after protein corona formation [30]. The influence of protein corona can largely account for the failure of biological fate prediction. \n\nThe investigation on protein corona is necessary to interpret the biological fate of nanoparticles, and to finally promote the clinical translation. Since K. A. Dawson et al. proposed the concept of protein corona in 2007 [31], many efforts have been made in this region. The protein corona formation behaviors and mechanisms of lipid-based [32], polymeric [33], metal [34] silica [35] and other nanoparticles [36][37][38] have been comprehensively explored. With these works, relatively profound understanding of protein corona formation phenomenon is obtained. \n\nOf note, the protein corona study should be continuously paid attention to. For one thing, because of the complex physiological environment, the interaction modes between coronated nanoparticles and cells are still unclear, limiting the interpretation of the in vivo evolution of protein corona. For another thing, nanoparticles prepared from new materials are emerging rapidly, and the previously established models cannot be directly applied to the new cases.",

Interestingly, the PS-COOH and PS-PO 3 functionalized NPs were expeditiously taken up, whereas PS-NH 2 and PS-SO 3 had a lower uptake in both the cell lines, as shown in Figure 7A-C. Further, artificially anchored NPs with a single protein corona either by the apolipoproteins ApoA4 or ApoC3 demonstrated a significantly reduced cellular uptake as illustrated in Figure 8A, while pre-coating other corona proteins such as ApoH improved the cellular uptake, as shown in Figure 8B [62]. Further, to examine the impact of protein corona on the synthetic identity of lipidbased nanoparticles (LNP) in biological systems, Chen et al. detailed the analysis of PC NPs which revealed that there was a \"missing connection\" between the physicochemical properties of NPs and their biological identity. However, there is a limited understanding of the impact of protein corona on the targeted delivery of tumors. It was demonstrated that protein corona on the surface of NPs could be manipulated by the design and development of a formulation. The alteration in the composition of the lipid component in LNPs could potentially change the charge on the NPs' surface and finally change the formed corona patterns in the serum of nude mice. Thus, lipid surface charge manipulation and a specific lipid switch on the NPs could alter the PC profile. In spite of this fact, negatively charged NPs had no profound effect on the formation of protein corona, while the institution of positively charged lipids into the nanosystem dramatically switched the pattern of PC from apolipoprotein to vitronectin-rich. The composition of this variant of protein corona had a great impact on cell transfection, biodistribution in vivo, and the efficient active delivery to tumor tissues. The corona rich with apolipoprotein demonstrated improved delivery to hepatocellular carcinoma mediated via the LDL receptor which was equated with vitronectin-rich NPs.",

[52] Designed nanoparticle libraries have been used to investigate the influence of different physico-chemical parameters such as size, [53] surface polarity and charge, [54] or colloidal stability. [55] Unfortunately, most of these parameters cannot be varied independently, and thus, even after decades of research, it is not possible to fully predict the protein corona formation based on the nanoparticles' physicochemical properties. [56] or most types of nanoparticles, a pronounced protein corona formation in contact with biological fluids can be observed. It is driven by multiple unspecific interactions, e.g. 9,70] Thus, prediction of nanocarrier-cell interactions is only possible, if the protein corona is taken into account. \n\nOnly recently it was recognized that protein corona formation is not happening on all nanoparticular systems [71][72][73] and nanoparticles without significant protein corona (i.e., often less than one protein per nanoparticle, in average) are indeed accessible. This observation was, however, overlooked in the field of protein corona research, which focuses on investigations on nanoparticles for which protein corona formation occurs [7][8][9][26][27][28]68,74] and accounts for about 1.500 publications up to middle of 2022.

Although it is clear that serum proteins will be adsorbed onto the surface of LNPs following the desorption of PEG-lipids upon systemic injections, the protein corona of different ligand-modified LNPs is not well studied yet. A recent study has reported that the nanoparticle protein corona would achieve a maximum thickness in biological fluids when the protein adsorption and desorption rates reached an equilibrium (Stordy et al. 2022). And conjugating targeting ligands to the equilibrated protein corona of the nanoparticles enabled efficient delivery to target cells, while conjugating the ligands to the naked nanoparticles resulted in a 55% reduction of binding affinity to target cells in serum, indicating the potential negative impact of serum proteins on ligand-modified nanoparticles. \n\nWhile various types of ligands were incorporated into LNPs to improve the specific delivery of nucleic acids, the major accessible organs are still limited to the liver, lungs, spleen, and tumor tissues. Indeed, organspecific delivery is often dependent on passive distribution. Only when LNPs reach the organ of interest can they make full use of their targeting moieties to realize specific binding and enhanced uptake (Kedmi et al. 2018). Therefore, it is not surprising that the liver, lungs, and spleen, where LNPs distribute most, and tumors whose vascularization promotes LNP accumulation, are generally easier to reach than other organs. In our view, future directions in LNP-based targeted nucleic acid delivery will be mostly aimed at developing the targeted LNPs to reach the hard-to-access organs (e.g., the brain, kidneys, heart, eyes, and bone) and cell types. A recent study has shown that intraperitoneal administration of LNPs containing cationic helper lipids induced efficient and specific mRNA delivery in the pancreas, which was mediated by peritoneal macrophage exosome secretion (Melamed et al. 2023).",

            "text": "The protein corona, formed upon the interaction of nanomaterials with proteins present in the biological milieu, alters their surface properties and biological identity. This corona can influence cellular uptake, biodistribution, and immune responses, thereby modulating the overall behavior and functionality of the nanomaterials in biological environments. Mo et al. showed that the size of BP can influence the identity and quantity of plasma proteins that form the corona, and in return, the corona could define the shape of ultra-small 2D NMs-corona complexes but does not change the shape of large 2D NMs [97]. Owing to the enrichment of immune proteins and other opsonins on the surface of BP nanomaterials, the uptake efficiency of BP-corona complexes by macrophages is higher, and the size-dependent cellular uptake pattern of BP-corona complexes is different from that of native nanomaterials. \n\nMitigating the influence of protein coronas on nanomaterials involves employing various strategies aimed at reducing or altering the protein-nanomaterial interactions. Surface modification and functionalization techniques serve as effective approaches to minimize protein adsorption onto nanomaterials. Introducing specific coatings or bio-compatible molecules, such as PEG or serum albumin, can deter protein binding, thus diminishing the formation of protein coronas. Precise control over nanomaterial properties, including size, shape, surface chemistry, and charge, offers another avenue to mitigate protein corona formation. Selecting or optimizing nanomaterial structures that exhibit reduced protein adsorption in biological environments helps alleviate the adverse effects of protein coronas on nanomaterial functionality. Understanding the interplay between two-dimensional nanomaterials and protein structures, as well as the impact of protein coronas, is crucial for designing tailored nanomaterials with desired functionalities for various biomedical applications. This comprehension facilitates the development of nanomaterials with enhanced biocompatibility, improved targeting efficiency, and minimized adverse effects, contributing to their utility in drug delivery, diagnostics, and therapeutic interventions. However, continued research is imperative to unravel the complexities of these interactions and exploit them effectively in the design and application of nanomaterials in biomedicine.",

            "text": "When flowing through the blood stream, drug carriers such as nanoparticles encounter hundreds of plasma proteins, forming a protein layer on the nanoparticle surface, known as the \u201cprotein corona\u201d. Since the protein corona influences the size, shape, and surface properties of nanoparticles, it can modulate their circulating lifetime, cytotoxicity, and targeting efficiency. Therefore, understanding the mechanism of protein corona formation at the atomic scale is crucial, which has become possible due to advances in computer power and simulation methodologies. This review covers the following topics: (1) the structure, dynamics, and composition of protein corona on nanoparticles; (2) the effects of protein concentration and ionic strength on protein corona formation; (3) the effects of particle size, morphology, and surface properties on corona formation; (4) the interactions among lipids, membranes, and nanoparticles with the protein corona. For each topic, mesoscale, coarse-grained, and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations since 2020 are discussed. These simulations not only successfully reproduce experimental observations but also provide physical insights into the protein corona formation. In particular, these simulation findings can be applied to manipulate the formation of a protein corona that can target specific cells, aiding in the rational design of nanomedicines for drug delivery applications.",

            "text": "This hypothesis is supported by the finding that other cationic helper lipids (EPC and DDAB) within such LNPs cause similar protein expression in the pancreas (Melamed et al., 2023). For the LNPs based on lipid 306O i10 , the distribution among different types of liver cells has been assessed too (Hajj et al., 2020). The expression of the reporter protein proved to be distributed among hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, and endothelial cells at a 70:15:15 ratio. \n\nAnother area of research is assessment of a distribution of LNPs based on ionizable lipids containing an amino head group and an acrylamide tail with a disulfide bond (Qiu et al., 2022). In vivo efficiency of luciferase synthesis (by translation) when fourcomponent LNPs were employed improved with increasing acrylamide tail length, and all the nanoparticles got distributed to lungs. After replacement of helper lipid DOPC (1,2-dioleoyl-snglycero-3-phosphocholine) with either DSPC or DOPE, the lung distribution persisted for LNPs based on the most effective lipid: 306-N16B. Of note, LNPs based on a similar ionizable lipid, 306-O12B (containing an ester bond instead of an amide bond) got completely distributed to the liver. In an analysis of the protein corona of LNPs based on either lipid 306-N16B or lipid 306-O12B, it was found that the LNPs targeted to the liver contain albumin, ApoE, and complement component C1 in the protein corona at 9%, 5%, and 5%, respectively, of the total corona proteins, whereas LNPs targeted to lungs contain albumin, fibrinogen \u03b2-chain, and fibrinogen \u03b3-chain at 17%, 5%, and 5%, respectively, of the total corona proteins. It was also revealed that negatively charged proteins predominantly (80%) constitute the protein corona of the LNPs targeted to the lungs.",

            "text": "In the case of LNPs, PEG length and alkyl chain affect both surface chemistry and PEG shedding rate [67], thereby influencing the surface coronation and targeting tissues.Pegylation plays a crucial role in determining the in vivo destination of LNPs and their payloads, suggesting its significance for LNP-mRNA therapeutic applications.Despite all the strides made, the underlying mechanisms and relationships between tissue targeting properties of LNP and protein corona formation remain elusive.Certain occurrences, such as the alteration of corona formation, have resulted in changes in tissue accumulation, yet a proper explanation is lacking [70].\n\nPrevious attempts illustrated that specific protein may serve as the nutrition or major supplement for the organs or the cells.There is also an explanation related to the receptor-mediated recognition, for which the most commonly acknowledged one is LDLR-corona protein-ApoE assisted liver targeting of LNP.However, various LDL receptors were identified other than ApoE, such as ApoA1.Basic knowledge related to physiology and pharmacodynamics remains to be explored.Therefore, while we appreciate the creativity of the concept of corona, it currently serves no more than a hypothesis in a long journey to promote LNP-mRNA into clinical stage.The lack of a liable detection technique also hinders the understanding of the protein corona phenomenon and stalls its development.Enabling in situ analysis of protein corona formation is crucial since current post-analysis via centrifugation separation and mass spectrometry is insufficient to unveil the authentic situation of protein adsorption around LNPs in the blood circulation.In a recent work, Zhan and colleagues [97] optimized the extraction of the corona in incubating serum by applying chromatography containing PEG-scFv (single-chain variable fragment).This facilitated the separation of pegylated nanoparticles and proteins while minimizing the depletion of protein corona components.Last but not least, predicting the in vivo performance of the corona protein formation around LNP, especially the stereochemistry and conformation of the absorbed proteins, which are essential to the cell-specific internalizations and successful translation of actively targeted LNP-mRNA, remains challenging.",

            "text": "The interactions between nanoparticles and proteins have significant biological consequences to the original nanoparticle and to the native proteic environment. On the one hand, the formation of the protein corona on the nanoparticle surface changes the nanoparticle physicochemical properties. It changes the size, shape, and even the aggregation state of the nanoparticle, which in turn affects how proteins are oriented and presented to the biological targets [17]. On the other hand, interactions with nanoparticles may trigger protein aggregation or conformational changes, which may impact the protein functions and their interaction with other biomolecules, and may even result in an immune response to eliminate the circulating nanoparticles. In this regard, changes in protein stability and enzyme activity have been observed when immobilized on the nanoparticle surface [6]. \n\nUpon entrance in the biological media, nanoparticles are involved in a myriad of biological processes. The formation of the protein corona creates a different structure that will drive and influence the behavior and interaction of the nanoparticles with biological systems. Thus, the protein corona can alter the interactions of the nanoparticle with the cell surface moieties (e.g., antibodies), promoting or inhibiting the uptake of the nanoparticle by the cell [18]. For instance, in a case of study with silica nanoparticle, it was observed that the formation of the protein corona reduced the cell uptake by weakening their cell membrane adhesion [19]. The protein corona also plays an important role in targeting the nanoparticles to different organs [13]. \n\nThe biological impact of the nanoparticle interactions with proteins is particularly relevant in the development and use of the NPPC in biomedicine. The small size of nanoparticles gives them the ability to efficiently access cell compartments, which has important biomedical implications, leading to important developments in the field of nanomedicine [20,21]. The feature of the protein corona, which can direct the nanoparticles to specific organs or locations, can be used to design NPPC that can be placed anywhere desired in the organism or in the cell.",

            "text": "Nanoparticles' physicochemical properties control the formation and composition of the protein corona. Whereas the extent of the impact of each property on the protein corona composition and disposition is not completely understood, there is an extended consensus that no nanoparticle property alone drives the formation of the corona, but all of them together [23]. Nanoparticle protein adsorptions are mainly driven by non-covalent forces, affinity constants of proteins and protein structure thermodynamics [24]. Thus, the nanoparticle surface constitutes a major factor influencing the protein corona [25]. In contrast to the previously commented direct influence of nanoparticle surface charge in the toxicity and biodistribution of nanoparticles, this parameter does not seem to be so influential on the formation and eventual biological effect of NPPC [22,25]. \n\nThe hydrophobicity of a nanoparticle's surface is, on the contrary, a significant factor limiting the amount and identity of the proteins bound to the nanoparticle. In this regard, for instance, Lynch et al. found that when plasma is incubated with low hydrophobic copolymer particles, virtually no protein is retrieved, while significant amounts of protein are consistently bound to hydrophobic particles [26]. Nanoparticle surface chemistry is also a driving parameter in the formation of the characteristics of the protein corona, as it controls the number of possible binding sites [12]. Nanoparticles commonly need to be functionalized with ligands and biomolecules that affect their solubility, stability, and define and control their biocompatibility and biological interactions [27]. This functionalization eventually affects the formation of the protein corona (because it largely confers a stealth character on the nanoparticle, protecting it and making it inaccessible to proteins) and could be crucial when developing nanoparticles with biological or therapeutical applications [28].",

About 300-500 human plasma proteins could be bound to different nanoparticles. Nanomaterials are rapidly coated by proteins in physiological fluids. The formation of the protein corona leads to the change in the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles, including hydrodynamic size, surface charge, and aggregation [84]. The structure of protein corona depends primarily on the nanoparticle material, size and surface properties, as well as on the composition of protein environment and experimental/physiological conditions [84][85][86]. In addition, it contributes to the colloidal stability of the particle, that presents the aggregation of the nanoparticles and protective from aggressive environmental conditions [87,88]. Functionalization of silver nanoparticles surface significantly affects the formation dynamics of protein corona. The presence of a protein coating on the surface of the nanoparticles strongly reduces the binding degree to the protein. On the contrary, the formation of the corona on the uncoated nanoparticles improved significantly their stability in biological environment. The in vitro experiments showed that the physiological stability of AgNps caused by the corona formation may be directly associated with their binding to the cell, capture and toxicity [89]. The interaction between nanoparticles and different cells is determined by the composition of protein corona [90].",

Supplementary Fig. 6). No aggregates were found when incubating LNPs with 10% serum saline 4 h after incubation. However, decomposition of A6 LNPs were observed at 4 h, which may be attributed to the degradation of biodegradable A6 lipids in serum (Supplementary Fig. 6). We then used a size-exclusion column to isolate the \"hard protein corona\" with higher binding affinity of cKK-E12 LNPs, A6 LNPs, and Syn-3 LNPs (Fig. S7) 22,23 and used proteomics to analyze the composition of proteins on LNPs (Supplementary Table 1). Forty-six proteins were detected and quantified (Fig. 2a) on the LNPs. These proteins are involved in the function of complement activation, immune responses, coagulation, acute phase response and lipid metabolism (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Table 1). Previous studies identified apolipopro-teinE (ApoE) as an important protein for LNPs; which can mediate LNP delivery to the liver 24,25 . Consistent with this, we identified ApoE in the corona of all three LNPs, and as the dominant plasma protein in the corona of A6 LNPs. Although the amount of ApoE appears similar in the corona of all three LNPs, the corona of cKK-E12 and Syn-3 LNPs is dominated by a 5-6fold increase in serum albumin concentration, with ApoE composing a much smaller fraction of the corona of these LNPs (Fig. 2b). \n\nSerum albumin and ApoE-mediated cellular uptake.",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulations are a proven method for the delivery of nucleic acids for gene therapy as exemplified by the worldwide rollout of LNP-based RNAi therapeutics and mRNA vaccines. However, targeting specific tissues or cells is still a major challenge. After LNP administration, LNPs interact with biological fluids (i.e., blood), components of which adsorb onto the LNP surface forming a layer of biomolecules termed the \"biomolecular corona (BMC)\" which affects LNP stability, biodistribution, and tissue tropism. The mechanisms by which the BMC influences tissue-and cell-specific targeting remains largely unknown, due to the technical challenges in isolating LNPs and their corona from complex biological media. In this study, we present a new technique that utilizes magnetic LNPs to isolate LNP-corona complexes from unbound proteins present in human serum. First, we developed a magnetic LNP formulation, containing >40 superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs)/LNP, the resulting LNPs containing iron oxide nanoparticles (IOLNPs) displayed a similar particle size and morphology as LNPs loaded with nucleic acids. We further demonstrated the isolation of the IOLNPs and their corresponding BMC from unbound proteins using a magnetic separation (MS) system. The BMC profile of LNP from the MS system was compared to size exclusion column chromatography and further analyzed via mass spectrometry, revealing differences in protein abundances. This new approach enabled a mild and versatile isolation of LNPs and its corona, while maintaining its structural integrity. The identification of the BMC associated with an intact LNP provides further insight into LNP interactions with biological fluids.",

The biological identity could be determined by protein corona, but whether and how the preadsorbed molecules impact the composition of the corona and immunological response have rarely been reported. Here, the effects of preadsorbed chymotrypsin (Chy) on forming protein corona and subsequent immunological response are reported. We find that preadsorbed Chy on the surface of AuNPs results in a protein corona with enriched immunoglobulins and reduced human serum albumin protein, which further affect the polarization of macrophages into specific phenotypes.

However, the limited understanding of the interaction between nanoparticles and biological entities is currently hampering the development of new systems and their applications in clinical settings. Proteins and lipids in biological fluids are known to complex with nanoparticles to form a \u201cbiomolecular corona\u201d. This has been shown to affect particles' morphology and behavior in biological systems and their interactions with cells. Hence, understanding how nanomaterials' physicochemical properties affect the formation and composition of this biocorona is a crucial step. This work evaluates existing literature on how morphology (size and shape), and surface chemistry (charge and hydrophobicity) of nanoparticles influence the formation of protein corona. The latest evidence suggest that although surface charge promotes the interaction with proteins and lipids, surface chemistry plays a leading role in determining the affinity of the nanoparticle for biomolecules and, ultimately, the composition of the corona. More recently the study of additional nanoparticles' properties like shape and surface chirality have demonstrated a significant effect on protein corona architecture, providing new tools to tailor biomolecular corona formation.

They profoundly influence the aggregation of nanoparticles and their cellular uptake (Dominguez-Medina et al., 2016). Also, it has been demonstrated that the protein corona composition affects the internalization of gold nanoparticle coated with different polymers (Walkey et al., 2014). Recently, it was found that the \"stealth effect\" of poly(ethylene glycol) may be explained by the presence of specific proteins in their protein corona (Sch\u00f6ttler et al., 2016). As summarized by Moore et al. (2015) the type of basal medium can dictate the size and stability of nanoparticles. Results from Strojan et al. (2017) demonstrated that the medium in which silica nanoparticles were dispersed, had significantly affected nanoparticles protein corona composition, suggesting an important implication on nanoparticles potential biological effects. Ji et al. (2010) have found that titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) nanoparticles increased their hydrodynamic in the presence of cell culture media without serum. By contrast, the addition of bovine serum protein stabilized nanoparticles, as there was only a little change in size following the addition of proteins (Spadavecchia et al., 2016). Moreover, as previously reviewed, different surface modifications (i.e. by using biocompatible polymers coating) can be used for lessening the protein corona formation then improving the stability of nanoparticles in liquid media (Iijima and Kamiya, 2009). Based on and in agreement with literature findings (Colombo et al., 2016), we inferred that the small increase observed on 5Au@PT nanoparticle size, in all complete media tested, might due to the higher surface functionalization with T, which decreased the extent of serum protein adsorption. By contrast, the lower amount of antibody per nanoparticle on 2.5Au@PT and 3.5Au@PT may favor protein absorption then resulting in an",

            "text": "Neuronanomedicine harnesses nanoparticle technology for the treatment of neurological disorders. An unavoidable consequence of nanoparticle delivery to biological systems is the formation of a protein corona on the nanoparticle surface. Despite the well-established influence of the protein corona on nanoparticle behavior and fate, as well as FDA approval of neuro-targeted nanotherapeutics, the effect of a physiologically relevant protein corona on nanoparticle-brain cell interactions is insufficiently explored. Indeed, less than 1% of protein corona studies have investigated protein coronas formed in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the fluid surrounding the brain. Herein, we utilize two clinically relevant polymeric nanoparticles (PLGA and PLGA-PEG) to evaluate the formation of serum and CSF protein coronas. LC-MS analysis revealed distinct protein compositions, with selective enrichment/depletion profiles. Following incubation with brain cells, serum and CSF coronas on PLGA particles showed enhanced associations with all cell types as compared to their corresponding corona on PLGA-PEG particles. CSF-derived protein coronas on PLGA nanoparticles, specifically, showed the greatest nanoparticle-cell interactions, with Pearson\u2019s correlation analysis revealing that proteins associated with enhanced nanoparticle-cell interactions were exclusively enriched in this protein corona. This study demonstrates the importance of correct choice of physiologically relevant biological fluids, and its influence on the formation of the protein corona, subsequent nanoparticle-cell interactions.",

            "text": "Nanotechnology has experienced enormous growth in recent decades, bringing forward the surging use of engineered nanoparticles as advantageous novel materials in numerous fields such as biomedicine, cosmetics, pharmacology, food, or agriculture [1,2]. Its unrestrained used has resulted in the ubiquity of these nanomaterials in the environment [3] and biological systems [4], and thus nanoparticles may potentially be inhaled, ingested, or taken up through the skin into the body [5]. Then, when nanoparticles come in contact with biological fluids, they become covered by a complex layer of biomolecules, such as proteins, lipids, or sugars, forming a sort of \"bio-corona\" [6,7]. Within the biological corona complexes formed in biological systems, the predominant and most studied molecules are proteins, which on their own form the so-called nanoparticle protein corona complex (NPPC) [5,8]. The protein corona defines the biological identity of the nanoparticle, the NPPC being the entity that finally interacts with and is \"seen\" or recognized by the cell [6]. \n\nUpon introduction in a biological fluid, the process of protein adsorption is an almost instantaneous event given the higher binding energy of the nanoparticle surface compared to the surrounding biological environment (Gibbs free energy drives the complex stability) [9,10]. The formation of the corona, driven by non-covalent forces, is dynamic and changes over time because of continuous association and dissociation processes given the different affinity of the proteins. Initially, higher concentration proteins will interact with the nanoparticle, but will eventually be displaced by higher-affinity proteins until reaching an equilibrium, when protein exchanges would not affect the composition of the corona [6,9,11,12]. In fact, although the formation of the corona takes place over the period of an hour, occurring minor changes for around 12 h [13], plasma proteins have been found in the corona already within the first minute of exposure [14]. Interestingly, the composition of the corona at such early stages does not significantly change over time in protein identities, but in quantities [14].",

However, clinical translation is still largely hindered by several factors, and the rapidly formed protein corona on the surface of NPs is one of them. The formation of protein corona is complicated and irreversible in the biological environment, and protein corona will redefine the \u201cbiological identity\u201d of NPs, which will alter the following biological events and therapeutic efficacy. Current understanding of protein corona is still limited and incomplete, and in many cases, protein corona has adverse impacts on nanomedicine, for instance, losing targeting ability, activating the immune response, and rapid clearance. Due to the considerable role of protein corona in NPs\u2019 biological fate, harnessing protein corona to achieve some therapeutic effects through various methods like biomimetic approaches is now treated as a promising way to meet the current challenges in nanomedicine such as poor pharmacokinetic properties, off-target effect, and immunogenicity. This review will first introduce the current understanding of protein corona and summarize the investigation process and technologies. Second, the strategies of harnessing protein corona with biomimetic approaches for nanomedicine design are reviewed.

            "text": "Pharmaceutical and medical applications of nanosystems represent a growing area in the flourishing field of nanotechnology, including developments in advanced pharmaceutical nanocarriers and nanodiagnostics [1][2][3]. Nanosized carriers of very diverse composition are being actively investigated, including metallic, polymeric, ceramic, and lipidic nanoparticles and also hybrid systems by combining such materials [4,5]. \n\nOne of the main limitations of these kinds of delivery systems is their short circulation time due to the opsonization phenomenon and subsequent uptake by the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS). After exposure of nanocarriers to biological fluids, biomolecules are rapidly adsorbed onto their surface forming the protein corona. The corona composition determines the biological identity of the nanoparticle and influences its toxicity, biological fate, circulation time, cell uptake, and drug release kinetics [6,7]. At first, the protein corona includes considerable amounts of low-affinity proteins which abound in the biological medium. Over time, the composition of the corona is enriched with high affinity proteins [7]. Interestingly, some of the adsorbed proteins are opsonins which promote the uptake and degradation of the nanoparticles by the cells of the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS) (mainly located in the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes). Among the proteins commonly found in the corona, IgG and proteins involved in the complement pathway typically act as opsonins (promoting uptake by MPS) whereas serum albumin and apolipoproteins enhance circulation time [8]. The clearance of the nanoparticles by the MPS reduces the bioavailability of the encapsulated drug [9,10]. A considerable amount of evidence, however, indicates that this phenomenon can be reduced by coating the nanoparticles with different polymeric substances [11][12][13]. \n\nLipid-based nanosystems stand out because of their nontoxic, biocompatible and environmentally friendly composition.",

            "text": "Protein corona formation is an intrinsic property of nanoparticles that are exposed to biological environments and is often modulated by a nanoparticle's physicochemical properties [160][161][162][163]. Corona composition is dynamic, and protein mobility plays an important role in the desorption/adsorption process. The Vroman effect addresses protein corona formation in materials exposed to a physiological environment and postulates that protein exchange will change corona composition, while the overall quantity of proteins remains roughly the same [163,164]. As reported for many cellular types, the uptake levels and mechanisms of internalization of nanoparticles are affected by the composition of this protein corona [165][166][167][168]. Particle biodistribution and clearance are also significantly influenced by the protein corona. Proteins such as serum albumin, apolipoproteins, fibrinogen, clusterin, and Ig gamma and light chains are commonly found in the protein corona of nanoparticles [163]. Many of these proteins are relatively featureless in terms of targeting; however, some are well-described ligands that cross the BBB via receptormediated transcytosis, e.g., Apo E. There have been promising attempts of controlling the corona formation to improve brain delivery of NPs. For example, Zhang et al. reported the functionalization of PEG-liposomes with a short peptide that binds to the lipid-binding domain of apolipoproteins, leaving the receptor-binding domain available to interact with lipoprotein receptor-related proteins and scavenger receptors class B, which affected intracranial glioma accumulation and notable increases in brain distribution [169]. Even though the protein corona is of interest in brain delivery, it also poses challenges in the investigation of particle properties [170][171][172]. \n\nCoating nanoparticles with molecules that avoid protein adsorption is a broadly implemented strategy in nanotherapeutic systems, and PEGylation is the most common approach.",

            "text": "The composition of the protein corona that forms around LNPs upon exposure to biological fluids is a key factor in their organ selectivity and biodistribution [28,35]. Given this well-established relationship, we sought to investigate whether the differences in our extrahepatic lipid library were reflected in distinct protein corona compositions, which could potentially explain their selective accumulation in non-hepatic tissues. With that purpose, we selected and purified the two top-performing ionizable lipids for lung targeting (A1T2C3, also named CP-LC-1067, and A3T2C7, also named CP-LC-1495) and the highestperforming lipid for spleen targeting (A2T2C9, also named CP-LC-1465). As controls, we included MC3-DOTAP and MC3-18:1 PA, well-established SORT formulations known for targeting the lung and spleen, respectively, with previously characterized protein coronas [12]. Additionally, we incorporated liver-targeting LNPs using SM-102 as the ionizable lipid and a control without LNPs. Subsequently, to mimic the in vivo environment, we incubated LNPs with human plasma, allowing the natural formation of a protein corona similar to that occurring in the bloodstream (Figure 4A). After purification and LNP proteincorona isolation, we performed mass-spectrometry-based proteomic analysis to identify and quantify the adsorbed proteins. \n\nPharmaceutics 2025, 17, x FOR PEER REVIEW 14 of 19 potential was identified as a key factor in organ targeting by our ionizable lipid library, we further analyzed its influence on related protein properties such as isoelectric point (pI) and overall charge. We found that in lung-targeting LNPs, the isoelectric point distribution of adsorbed proteins was slightly shifted toward pI ~5.5 compared with liver-and spleen-targeting LNPs (Figure 4C). This may be attributed to their higher zeta potential, which likely influences protein binding. Notably, vitronectin [12], a key mediator of lung uptake, has a pI of ~5.5, suggesting a potential explanation for this enrichment.",

            "text": "Recently, the transfection of HepG2 cells with LNPs also showed the impact of C18 lipid-PEG in serum-containing medium. It was observed that the addition of FBS could decrease the transfection efficacy of C18 LNPs while increasing the efficacy of C14 LNPs. The authors discussed these results, suggesting that the protein corona could either hinder the uptake process or facilitate it due to other receptor-mediated phenomenon [4]. Even if the protein corona has been described to inhibit transfection, it now appears that some of the proteins included in this corona could specifically interact with cellular processes and particles trafficking [2]. Regarding the results obtained in this study, it could then be hypothesized that C14 lipids-PEG dissociate in serum, which can facilitate transfection, as PEG is known to prevent the cellular uptake and endosomal escape processes [6]. Following this desorption, PEG could be replaced by a protein corona, which could also play a positive role on transfection, depending on its composition. In contrast, C18 lipids-PEG have strong anchoring ability which allows for the prevention of protein corona formation, but could also be an obstacle to transfection. Moreover, as explained by Chen et al., PEG cannot completely eliminate the binding of proteins around LNPs, and that proteins could impact the transfection in serum. \n\nSeveral parameters must then be considered when designing LNPs. The use of long lipids-PEG can offer an efficient protection against protein corona formation, prolong the circulation of LNPs, and increase the accumulation in tumor. Nevertheless, the transfection efficacy of these LNPs could finally be lower than expected because of the barrier effect of PEG. However, this effect could be balanced by an intermediate proportion of C18 lipid-PEG in LNPs formulations if an equilibrium between efficient stealth properties and efficient transfection can be found. On the other hand, recent examples highlighted the interest in using short lipids-PEG in order to avoid long effect or to target hepatic diseases. In that case, the formation of the protein corona is intended, and recent studies demonstrated the high transfection efficacy of these LNPs.",

            "text": "The fate of a nanoparticle, i.e., the biological area that it will target, is known to be dependent upon the nature of the particle itself, i.e., its hydrophobicity, size, radius of curvature, charge, coatings, etc. These factors influence the protein coating that is formed around nanoparticles when it enters a biological fluid. This coated-protein structure of nanoparticles is called a protein corona. The coated protein may undergo conformational change, leading to the exposure of new epitopes and altered function. Protein corona interacts with certain biological membranes while showing no interaction with certain other biological membranes. It shows specificity, thus determining the fate of nanoparticles. Protein binding to nanoparticles also helps to increase the dissolution rate of nanoparticles [47,48]. As depicted in Figure 1, a protein corona forms once nanoparticles are injected inside the body, where it interacts with serum biomolecules, especially protein. Highaffinity proteins bind tightly with the nanoparticle surface, forming a first layer of hard corona followed by the reversible adsorption of low-affinity protein, forming an additional layer of soft corona [49]. The nature of nanoparticles, such as size, charge, hydrophobicity, etc., contributes to the formation of the corona. Various interactions take place between the corona and the surrounding environment and the corona dynamically changes. These interactions include steric hindrance, protein binding capability, available surface area, binding interaction and characteristic protein attachment/detachment. Steric hindrance prevents binding of the corona to other particles. The available surface area, surface coverage and angle of curvature determine the adsorption profile of nanoparticles. Binding interaction releases surface-free energy, leading to surface reconstruction of the corona. Competitive binding interaction depends upon protein composition and body fluid composition. Characteristic protein attachment/detachment depends upon the material type and protein characteristic. All these interactions help to change the corona dynamically. The corona changes when particles translocate from one biological compartment to another. In the process of formation of the protein corona, when the protein interacts with nanoparticles, they undergo potential changes in their structure and function. Basically, protein conformational change takes place, leading",

This phenomenon significantly influences the behavior, functionality, and biological interactions of nanoparticles with biosystems. Until now, conclusions regarding the role of the protein corona in specific biological applications have been based on establishing correlation rather than causation. By understanding causality, researchers can predict how changes in nanoparticle properties or biological conditions will affect protein corona composition, in turn affecting the nanoparticle interactions with the biosystems and their applications. This predictive capability is essential for designing nanoparticles with specific characteristics tailored for therapeutic and diagnostic nanomedicine applications. Here, we explore the concept of \u201cactual causality\u201d (by Halpern and Pearl) to mathematically prove how various small molecules, including metabolites, lipids, vitamins, and nutrients, spiked into plasma can induce diverse protein corona patterns on identical nanoparticles. This approach significantly enhances the depth of plasma proteome profiling. Our findings reveal that among the various spiked small molecules, phosphatidylcholine was the actual cause of the observed increase in the proteomic depth of the plasma sample. By considering the concept of causality in the field of protein corona, the nanomedicine community can substantially improve their ability to design safer and more efficient nanoparticles for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.",

The sizes of both types of NPs increased with more negatively charged interfaces upon being introduced into fetal bovine serum. Gel electrophoresis and label-free quantitative proteomics were performed to identify proteins recruited to the hard corona, and fewer proteins were found in albumin NPs than in liposomes, which is in accordance with isothermal titration calorimetry. The cellular uptake efficiency of the two NPs significantly differed in different serum concentrations, which was further scrutinized by loading an anticancer compound into albumin NPs. The presence of the hard protein corona increased the cellular uptake of albumin NPs in comparison with liposomes. In our simulation study, a specific receptor present in the membrane was greatly attracted to the albumin-apolipoprotein E complex. Overall, this study not only evaluated protein corona formation on albumin NPs, but also made promising advancements toward albumin- and liposome-based therapeutic systems.",

            "text": "In an attempt to understand the biomolecular corona, several studies have been reported wherein, the concentration of the protein in the medium was varied. It was suggested that exposure of NPs at a low protein concentration allows relatively few proteins to adhere and distribute on the NPs surface forming a stable NP-protein complex. The protein layers experience a higher degree of conformational changes while masking the NPs surface. However, when the exposure media contains a high concentration of proteins, dense layering occurs and in this case, the majority of the interactions are governed by the adjacent polypeptide fragments. Comparatively lesser conformational changes are noticed since the contact between the NPs surface and the proteins are minimized. 44,45 olystyrene-and silica-NPs (200 nm) demonstrated varied patterns of bound corona upon incubation with an increasing concentration of plasma (3-80%). Densitometric analysis showed that for polystyrene NPs increasing the protein concentration directly increased the amount of bound corona, whereas for silica NPs the amount of protein decreased. SDS-PAGE and LC-MS/MS analysis suggested that in a multiprotein system such a blood plasma, high binding proteins which are present in smaller amounts such as histidine-rich glycoprotein tends to replace low-binding affinity protein such as \ue103brinogen and proteins with a molecular weight in the 50-70 kDa range (present in comparatively much higher amounts in the blood plasma). 44 Similarly, for MNPs, for increasing serum concentration the apolipoprotein E-1 (ApOE-1) protein component signi\ue103cantly increased as compared to albumin and transferrin. 46 Analysis of potential protein adsorptive property of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles (PLGA-NPs) demonstrated that variation in the protein source such as fetal bovine serum (FBS) or human serum, can impact corona formation in terms of both quantity and quality. For 0.08 m 2 area of PLGA-NPs incubated with 50 mL human serum or FBS, the bound protein was observed to be 160.91 mg and 23.08 mg respectively.",

Lipid-based nanoparticles are, however, difficult to study analytically and so our understanding of the interaction between LNPs and biological systems remains obscure, particularly in terms of biomolecular corona formation and the impact this has on therapeutic efficacy and targeting. Ideally, we would like to engineer particles to acquire corona components that facilitate targeting, cargo delivery and improved safety. This requires studying the relationship between LNPs, biofluids and the resulting coronas. The particle-corona complexes are, however, fragile and biofluids also contain particles (such as lipoproteins) with sizes and biochemical characteristics similar to lipid nanoparticles, so contamination with biological components is a challenge. Here we describe a rapid, automated, and unbiased isolation method for LNP biomolecular coronas, coupled with proteomic and lipidomic analysis. Using these analytical methods, we systematically studied, in lean and obese rats, the variation in LNP-mediated mRNA delivery caused by individual physiology. A comprehensive multivariate model links LNP corona content to efficacy, identifying and validating high-density lipoproteins as a previously unidentified factor affecting particle efficacy.",

            "text": "Protein corona refers to the bound or adsorbed proteins around nanoparticles while they are exposed to various physiological fluids in the systemic circulation. Some of the most abundant proteins include transferrin, fibrinogen, albumin, complement C3, haptoglobin, \u03b1-2-macroglobulin, and immunoglobulins A, M, and G [158]. This exposure is inevitably responsible for altering their overall pharmacological and toxicological profile and ultimately triggers an unpredictable therapeutic function. Some of the physicochemical factors responsible for coronal protein adsorption include nanoparticle material hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity, surface charge, size, and shape [158][159][160][161][162]. Studies have shown that a decrease in nanoparticle size decreases the surface interaction impacting the protein conformation, and similarly, a spherical shape of nanoparticles offers increased mass/surface ratio that overall reduces interaction with the proteins in the environment [163][164][165]. Additionally, the nature of the nanoparticle also plays a crucial role in the formation of the protein corona such that hydrophilic nanoparticles attract charged proteins via electrostatic forces, while hydrophobic nanoparticles bind to hydrophobic proteins through van der Waal's or \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions [162,166]. Lastly, the surface charge promotes protein corona formation in instances where the nanoparticles are highly charged as compared to slightly negatively charged nanoparticles, which offer the least protein interactions and therefore avoid the corona formation [167,168]. \n\nOver the past few years, there has been progressive understanding regarding the effect of protein coronas on nanoparticles. Taking a glance at its formation, initially, when the nanoparticles encounter biological fluids, a \"soft\" corona is formed that represents a loosely bound and rapidly exchanging layer of the highly abundant proteins adsorbed during circulation. Following this, it is further coated with other proteins of high affinity as per the Vroman effect and is now termed as \"hard\" corona [169][170][171]. This leads to a decrease in enthalpy and displacement of the hydration layer surrounding the nanoparticles, subsequently enhancing entropy.",

            "text": "The adsorption of proteins on the surface of nanoparticles when they come in contact with the protein rich environment plays a vital role in deciding the fate of NPs. Several studies have described the role of protein adsorption in biological interactions [84] and have stated that \"Protein corona\" refers to the spontaneous self-assembly or biomolecular coating of the proteins on the surface of nanoparticles [85]. The formation of corona not only alters the physical properties of the nanomaterials such as size, surface charge, shape but also alerts the immune system of the body to recognize the nanoparticles as an intruder and hastens the process of opsonization [86]. Having said that, it becomes important to identify various characterization techniques to detect the extent of protein corona formation. Though several techniques such as quantitative and qualitative proteomic assays have been described to characterize the protein corona formation of the nanoparticles [87], very few studies have reported on its formation around BP nanomaterials. Here, we have discussed the techniques available to characterize the formation of protein corona around the BP nanomaterials. \n\nElectron microscopies, such as TEM, provide a clear picture of protein corona formation around the nanoparticles. For instance, in a previous study [88], the size of BPNSs was increased by 11.9 nm after being covered by plasma proteins and, in another study, the size increased by 30 nm [89]. The corona formation can also be detected by a change in surface charge. The surfaces of BPNSs coated with plasma proteins were entirely different from the native form and the charge changed to a positive value from negative. Liquid chromatography with a mass spectrometry detector was used to qualitatively analyze the compo-",

[69] engineered aerosolized LNPs for pulmonary delivery of mRNA.They optimized PEGylation parameters to achieve efficient mRNA delivery to the lungs.They found that increasing the PEG ratio in the LNP formulation not only reduced the size of LNPs but also decreased intracellular protein expression of mRNA.Therefore, precise consideration of the extent of PEG-anchored lipids is crucial when designing LNP-mRNA for lung therapeutics.This approach represents a significant advancement in developing noninvasive respiratory therapies with potential applications in treating various pulmonary diseases.\n\nThe protein corona phenomenon, mainly influenced by the surface properties of LNPs, has become popular among researchers in the field of nanosized drug delivery systems.After the administration of LNPs, serum proteins are adsorbed on the surface of the nanoparticles evidently, forming a protein corona.This corona may impede targeted efficacy by shielding surface ligands necessary for specific cell or receptor recognition.Surface-exposed PEGylated lipids play a crucial role in determining and regulating the composition of the corona proteins on LNPs.Parallelly, the compositions of the corona proteins can govern the distributions of the nanoparticles due to the organ-specific accumulations of the serum proteins, such as ApoE for the liver and complementary system-related proteins for the spleen.\n\nIn a recent study, Chen et al. [70] investigated the role of apolipoprotein-and vitronectin-enriched corona on LNPs for targeted delivery and transfection of oligonucleotides in murine tumor models.A slight change in the physicochemical properties of LNPs altered the corona pattern.For instance, the introduction of positive charge via cationic lipid 3\u03b2-{N-[2-(dimethylamino) ethyl]carbamoyl}cholesterol (DC-cholesterol) as a substitution for original cholesterol shifted the protein corona pattern from apolipoprotein-rich to vitronectin-rich.",

            "text": "Furthermore, we examined the protein corona profiles of our most effective ILs to gain insights into their targeting mechanisms. Our data show that the lipid composition strongly influences their protein adsorption patterns, affecting their physicochemical properties and ultimately controlling tissue tropism. Lung-targeting LNPs exhibited distinct protein enrichment, including of vitronectin and prothrombin, supporting previously described mechanisms of protein corona-mediated lung selectivity [35]. In contrast, the protein-corona composition of spleen-targeting LNPs lacked a clear correlation with known targeting pathways, suggesting an alternative, but as-yet unidentified, mechanism of action. \n\nIn conclusion, these findings provide a strong foundation for the rational design of LNP systems with enhanced organ-targeting precision, guided by the structure-activity relationships of ionizable lipids and the LNP zeta potential. Understanding the molecular basis of extrahepatic targeting, including the key protein interactions that drive LNP accumulation in extrahepatic tissue, will be critical for optimizing these formulations for clinical use. Future studies should aim to elucidate these mechanisms and to evaluate the full safety profile, stability, and therapeutic potential of these LNPs in clinically relevant models. This approach holds significant promise for improving the specificity and efficacy of mRNA-based therapies, enabling more precise extrahepatic delivery and expanding the therapeutic landscape for a broad range of clinical applications, including in vaccines, cancer immunotherapy, and treatments for genetic and inflammatory diseases.",

            "text": "Recent developments of new synthetic methodologies for NPs' synthesis have allowed a systematic investigation of the effects of NPs' shape on their properties (Wu et al., 2016), providing a potential tool to tailor the behavior of NPs both in vitro and in vivo (Da Silva-Candal et al., 2019;Zhao et al., 2017), however, the role that shape can play in influencing PC formation on NPs has yet to be fully explored. \n\nIn 2018, Garc\u00eda-Alvarez et al. demonstrated that for gold NPs, particle shape could influence the formation of a PC in vivo (Garc\u00eda-Alvarez et al., 2018). Rod or star-shaped gold NPs with a diameter of either 40 or 70 nm were injected in mice and the corona-coated particles were isolated from the animal's plasma through a previously validated chromatographic method (Hadjidemetriou et al., 2016). Total amount of proteins recovered from stars were significantly higher compared to rods of the same size, indicating that NPs shape significantly altered the affinity of the particles for serum proteins. Protein qualitative analysis via LC-MS/MS revealed that the composition of the PC was overall relatively similar for 70 nm NPs, with stars and rods sharing 82% and 72% of the proteins in their corona respectively. PC diversity increased with 40 nm NPs instead, with gold nanostars having a slightly more diverse corona (about 64% of common proteins) compared to gold nanorods (88%). This study features a comprehensive analysis of PC obtained from in vivo conditions and offers therefore a representative view on the effect of particle shape on the formation of PC. \n\nMore recently, particle shape was also found to affect the formation of PC on mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN). Visalakshan et al were able to show that the amount of proteins adsorbed on rods from serum was higher (6 mg/m 2 ) compared to spheres (1.5 mg/m 2 ; Visalakshan et al., 2020). Notably, the particle shape directly affected the composition of the adsorbed corona and in particular the relative amount of immunoglobulins, which were found to be 57% of the total corona in the case of rods as opposed to 42% for spheres.",

On th hand, the formation of the protein corona on the nanoparticle surface changes the n particle physicochemical properties.

On the other hand, interactions with nanoparticles may tr protein aggregation or conformational changes, which may impact the protein func and their interaction with other biomolecules, and may even result in an immune resp to eliminate the circulating nanoparticles. In this regard, changes in protein stability enzyme activity have been observed when immobilized on the nanoparticle surface Upon entrance in the biological media, nanoparticles are involved in a myriad ological processes.

            "text": "Although the constant improvements in nanoscience and nanotechnology are raising the bar of nanomaterial applications in biomedicine, the efforts of manufacturers are very often frustrated by the adverse effects of biological environments on nanomaterials. The main reason is that, upon exposure to a biological environment, the nanomaterial surface is subjected to competitive binding of different macromolecules, resulting in a biological shell, called protein corona, characterized by a composition that can be extremely variable depending on biological milieus and time. As a consequence, upon their introduction in vivo, engineered nanoparticles enter into an inevitable and hardly predictable progressive transformation that, in most cases, leads to their elimination. \n\nThe in-depth comprehension of the interactions and mutual influences between proteins and nanoparticles represents one of the main goals for the successful transfer of nanotechnologies into medicine [1,2] and, more specifically, for the control over protein corona formation in vivo, which can be pivotal for determining opposite scenarios: the elimination or the effective internalization of nanocarriers [3]. \n\nIn recent years, attempts to modulate the nature of the protein corona were carried out by designing tailored nanoparticle ligands and their distribution on the nanomaterial surface [4][5][6][7][8]. Specific ligands can ideally control the nature of the protein shell by the incorporation of suitable functionalities for the selection and orientation of proteins during the formation of soft or hard corona shells [9]. As an example, hydrophobic coatings on gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) induce protein denaturation and irreversible protein binding (hard corona), making proteins readily susceptible to proteolysis by endogenous enzymes [10]. Conversely, AuNPs coated with tetra(ethylene glycol) (TEG), which prevents hydrophobic interactions, formed soft coronas with retained protein structure while slowing proteolysis [9,11,12]. Furthermore, the zwitterionic sulfobetaine surfactant has been shown to provide \"stealth\" properties to AuNPs, leading to corona-free nanoparticles in serum [5].",

            "text": "NPs possess unique physiochemical properties 56 , such as size 57,58 , shape 59 and surface chemistries 19,57,60 , that can affect the formation of the protein corona. Additionally, the corona profile can be influenced by ambient factors such as biomolecule concentration 60 , pH 61 , ionic strength 62 , temperature 63 and incubation time [64][65][66] . Upon corona formation, the identity of the NP is transformed; its physicochemical properties 67 , targeting abilities 20,28,68 and biological responses 17,22,65,69 change owing to the surrogated biological identity dictated by the adsorbed proteins. For example, characterization of the protein corona on core-shell NPs, composed of identical PEGylated lipid bilayer shells with varying core elasticities, revealed that apolipoprotein A1 preferentially adsorbs onto NPs with intermediate elasticity and the adsorption strongly correlates with longer NP elasticity-dependent in vivo systemic circulation lifetimes 70 . \n\nTime-dependent profiling of protein coronas, extracted from human plasma, revealed that the formation of protein corona fingerprints occurs rapidly (~30 s), and the amount of protein in the corona, but not the composition of the protein profile, can change over time 71 . Moreover, the rapid formation of the protein corona impacts the kinetic pathophysiology of the NPs. For example, both an increased NP uptake by microvascular endothelial cells and the inhibition of erythrocyte haemolysis were observed upon protein corona formation 71 . The study of in situ protein corona formation in complex biological matrices, such as whole blood and plasma, showed that PEGylated gold NPs do not aggregate in these fluidic environments 72 . \n\nProtein coronas incorporate both soft and hard coronas. The soft corona, comprising biomolecules such as proteins with low affinities to NP surfaces, endures dynamic and reversible exchanges that are dependent on the conditions of the surrounding biological fluid 58,73,74 . The hard corona develops gradually, is more stable and is composed of 'relatively immobile' proteins with substantial affinities to, and low tendencies to dissociate from, NP surfaces 57,60,64 .",

In that context, given the place for protein adsorption (i.e., the NP-direct environment interface), it stands to reason that protein corona formation should depend on physical and chemical characteristics of both NPs and their biological surroundings (Piperigkou et al. 2016b). Protein adsorption on NP surface is therefore influenced by such determinants as NP components and configuration (Roach et al. 2005;Maiorano et al. 2010), their hydrophobic/ hydrophilic characteristics (Walczyk et al. 2010) and sedimentation (particularly in systems of in vitro exposure) (Dutta et al. 2007), whereas as regards the surrounding NP environment, one may mention among others factors such as the temperature, pH and incidence of certain functional groups.",

In that context, given the place for protein adsorption (i.e., the NP-direct environment interface), it stands to reason that protein corona formation should depend on physical and chemical characteristics of both NPs and their biological surroundings (Piperigkou et al. 2016b). Protein adsorption on NP surface is therefore influenced by such determinants as NP components and configuration (Roach et al. 2005;Maiorano et al. 2010), their hydrophobic/ hydrophilic characteristics (Walczyk et al. 2010) and sedimentation (particularly in systems of in vitro exposure) (Dutta et al. 2007), whereas as regards the surrounding NP environment, one may mention among others factors such as the temperature, pH and incidence of certain functional groups.",

            "text": "This review delved into the intricate interactions between proteins and nanogels and polymeric nanoparticles in protein-contacting environments like blood, serum, or cell cultures. To begin with, the conventional concepts of hard and soft coronas formed on nanoparticle surfaces were introduced. This was followed by a comprehensive discussion of fabrication methods of nanogels and PNPs, serving as drug carriers or nanoparticles to interact with serum. Critical factors such as size, surface charge, and hydrophobicity were thoroughly explored, as they significantly influence the composition of the protein corona. Surface modification techniques like PEGylation, enhanced hydrophilicity, and artificial protein corona addition were investigated for targeted protein corona formation. Protein separation and nanoproteomics emerged as intriguing applications of the protein corona, with promising potential for disease diagnosis and treatment. The review covered centrifugation, magnetism-, and chromatography-based techniques for isolating protein corona nanoparticles. While this review aimed to address the primary needs in the field of protein separation and nanoproteomics, several challenges still require consideration. \n\nIn the synthesis and fabrication realm, the use of stimuli-responsive PNPs and nanogels offers the potential for specific protein adsorption and desorption. The regulation of surface hydrophilicity in thermo-responsive materials through temperature holds promise for protein separation applications. Additionally, the synthesis of ultra-small nanoparticles (sub-10 nm) through single-chain polymer reactions presents attractive properties due to their high surface area, but their effects on the protein corona formation mechanism remain an unknown aspect. Scaling up the production of ultra-small nanoparticles poses a challenge, necessitating innovative fixes or regulations of existing methods. \n\nEvaluating the performance of nanoparticles in whole blood or human serum is crucial for identifying their strengths and weaknesses. Sustained microfluidic separation methods may prove useful in this regard. Size-based or spiral geometries for trapping protein coronas offer promising approaches, fostering collaboration among chemists, material scientists, and biological researchers. \n\nThe incorporation of magnetic nanoparticles in PNPs and nanogels holds potential for their efficient use in solution without protein loss and non-specific separation.",

            "text": "Since the beginning of the twentieth century [1], manufactured gold nanoparticles (GNP) have been constantly developed for biomedical applications, be it for diagnosis or therapy [2][3][4][5]. The enthusiasm aroused by their unique properties, among which spectroscopic and catalytic, and the possible progress they could generate, lead some to talk about a new \"Golden Age\" [4]. With years, the design of nanoparticles (NP) is complexifying, allowing multiple functionalities on the same object [6][7][8]. Such sophistication is not achievable with small organic molecules or metallic salts, which accounts for the impetus to consider NP as theragnostic platforms. However, once in a biological environment, NP are submitted to new interactions and constraints that could affect their performance (enzymatic digestion, mechanical stress due to rapid blood flow, corrosion, ligand exchange\u2026). In particular, NP are expected to interact with biomolecules, such as proteins, lipids, nucleic acids and even metabolites, in large extent because of their large surface-to-mass ratio. In fact, the awareness that the synthetic identity of NP could greatly differ from their biological identity is now spreading.\n\nBecause of proteins omnipresence in biological fluids and the increased number of highly sensitive analytical techniques, there has been a growing number of papers dealing with the formation of a protein corona at the surface of NP [9][10][11][12]. Usually, one distinguishes two components in this dynamic process: the soft and the hard coronas. Soft and hard coronas can be defined by their relative affinity for NP surface and exchange times. Hard corona is made by a protein fraction strongly bound to the surface while soft corona is formed by loosely-bound proteins, maybe via protein-protein interaction [10]. The protein corona can thus be multi-layered. NP surface may then get modified and the corona may substantially influence the biological response.\n\nIn this review, we will focus mainly on gold nanoparticles (GNP). In a first part, corona characterization will be summarized. We will attempt to draw the main findings regarding what happens to GNP in a biological fluid in terms of size, charge, aggregation state and corona composition.",

            "text": "Protein-IONP interactions can be characterized as covalent or non-covalent and may involve rearrangement of interfacial water molecules, or conformational changes in the protein or in the nanoparticle's surface. The interaction between the protein and the nanoparticle occurs through a special region of the protein known as the \"domain\" [75]. Essentially, the protein corona is a result of simultaneous adsorption of multiple proteins via protein-nanoparticle or protein-protein interactions. Proteins that adsorb with a high affinity, and are tightly bound form a hard corona. Conversely, proteins that adsorb with a low affinity, and are loosely bound form a soft corona. Hard corona proteins directly interact with the nanoparticle's surface, while soft corona proteins interact with the hard corona via protein-protein interactions [76,77]. The resultant protein corona, a composite of the hard and soft corona, induces a physiological response when exposed to biomolecules, biological barriers, and cells [77]. It has been recognized that protein corona formation is ubiquitous and independent of NP nature [78]. Researchers have uncovered protein corona formation in several studies. Rapid protein corona formation was observed in the presence of silica and polystyrene nanoparticles [79], and long lived corona were found on nanoparticles exposed to serum or plasma [80]. Other studies have investigated the biocompatibility of nanoparticles upon corona formation [81] as well as the nanoparticles aggregation and cell viability within the culture medium [82]. Consequently, reports have shown that the protein corona can alter the interactions between nanoparticles and produce aggregation, leading to the need and use of polymeric surface stabilizer that protect the nanoparticle surface from protein corona formation [57,[83][84][85][86]. Furthermore, stable polymer coated magnetic nanoparticles were reportedly used in biomedical applications [6,12] and for wastewater remediation [46]. \n\nNanoparticle coating characteristics and size are known to impact the cellular uptake of IONPs [84].",

Here, we investigate the impact of a bovine serum albumin corona on interactions between silica nanoparticles (SNPs) of two different sizes and giant lipid vesicles. The formation of the protein corona leads to a significant increase of the hydrodynamic size of the SNPs. Confocal microscopy imaging shows that the protein corona alters the morphological response of vesicles to SNPs. In addition, Laurdan spectral imaging show that the protein corona weakens the effect of SNPs on the lipid packing in the GUV membrane. Our results demonstrate that a protein corona can change the interaction mechanism between nanoparticles and lipid membranes.",

SPR has been applied to study the interplay between NPs and isolated serum proteins in order to optimize LNP's formulation design (Table 1). SPR has contributed to study fibrinogen, human serum albumin and bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor adsorption onto both neutral and negatively charged PEG-decorated liposomes (Efremova et al., 2000). Interestingly, the observed reduction in protein adsorption as PEG densities in the nanovehicles increases agreed with theoretical predictions. These results suggest that SPR studies could contribute to establish the physical basis of the different interactions of LNPs with proteins and cells. Moreover, particular proteins of the NPs' corona were identified by means of SPR experiments on LNPs preincubated with serum (Canovi et al., 2012) and the real-time protein corona formation was followed on surface-immobilized NPs (Kari et al., 2017).",

            "text": "The size of aggregates may be dependent on the concentration and they tend to be slightly larger in culture media than in PBS. Moreover, monovalent and divalent cations may affect aggregate formation. Adsorption of media components, serum proteins and Ca 2+ on nanoparticle surface determines NP aggregations and size distribution [14]. Agglomeration leads to cytotoxicity reduction, because of lower availability of inorganic NPs in contact with cells. In addition, the size of aggregates prevents their cellular internalisation [39]. Studies based on silica nanoparticles indicated that minimization of NP aggregation could be obtained by introducing an optimum balance of inert (e.g., methyl phosphonate) and active (e.g., hydroxyl and aldehyde) functional groups to the surface [41]. \n\nThe protein layer of several nanometres on particle surface is called protein corona and it can be divided into a peripheral soft corona (SC)-dynamic protein exchanges with the surrounding medium-and a hard corona (HC)-a layer of more or less temporal constant composition (Figure 2, Table 2) [34,42,43]. In blood plasma, the surface of nanoparticles mainly adsorbs proteins, but some minor traces of lipids have also been found in the corona structure. Adsorption of proteins on the nanoparticle surface is the result of protein-nanoparticle binding affinities and protein-protein interactions. Hard corona interacts directly with the nanomaterial surface. Soft corona proteins interact with the hard corona via weak proteinprotein interactions. Interestingly, the corona on the NP surface does not completely mask the nanomaterial surface or its functional groups [43]. The formation of protein corona and its thickness is a parameter that is also dependent on protein concentration, temperature, duration of particle-protein interaction, serum concentration and shear stress [34,44]. \n\nProtein corona formation strongly affects cellular uptake mechanism, cell-nanoparticle interactions, intracellular location as well as cellular response (e.g., biocompatibility) [34,35,44].",

After incubation in either 10% or 100% serum, the hard protein corona\u2013particle complexes were collected and analyzed by DLS, zeta-potential, and TGA, and the corona proteins were analyzed with SDS-PAGE. A good correlation between SDS-PAGE and TG results in terms of total amounts of proteins adsorbed was established. The results demonstrated that more proteins, especially apolipoproteins, were associated with the particles at higher serum concentration regardless of surface chemistry and morphological differences. Also, the mean molecular weight of the adsorbed proteins was clearly lower under full serum conditions modeling in vivo conditions as compared to under dilute conditions modeling in vitro conditions, but functionalization of the MSNs by carboxylic acid functionalities reduced protein adsorption. The influence of the structural characteristics of the MSNs on the protein adsorption was minor.",

For this purpose, it describes general concepts to control (guide/minimize) the interaction between artificial nanoparticles and plasma proteins to reduce protein corona formation. Thereafter, methods for the qualitative or quantitative determination of protein corona formation are presented, as well as the properties of nanoparticle surfaces, which are relevant for protein corona prevention (or formation). Thereby especially the role of grafting density of hydrophilic polymers on the surface of the nanoparticle is discussed to prevent the formation of a protein corona. In this context also the potential of detergents (surfactants) for a temporary modification as well as grafting\u2010to and grafting\u2010from approaches for a permanent modification of the surface are discussed. The review concludes by highlighting several promising avenues. This includes (i) the use of nanoparticles without protein corona for active targeting, (ii) the use of synthetic nanoparticles without protein corona formation to address the immune system, (iii) the recollection of nanoparticles with a defined protein corona after in vivo application to sample the blood proteome and (iv) further concepts to reduce protein corona formation.",

A relevant point to be considered in the design and development of nanovehicles intended for medical use is the formation of the \u201cprotein corona\u201d around the nanoparticle, that is, a complex biomolecular layer formed when the nanovehicle is exposed to biological fluids. The chemical nature of the protein corona determines the biological identity of the nanoparticle and influences, among others, the recognition of the nanocarrier by the mononuclear phagocytic system and, thus, its clearance from the blood. Recent works suggest that Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR), extensively employed for the analysis of biomolecular interactions, can shed light on the formation of the protein corona and its interaction with the surroundings. The synthesis and characterization of solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) coated with polymers of different chemical nature (e.g., polyvinyl alcohol, chitosans) are reported. The proof-of-concept for the use of SPR technique in characterizing protein-nanoparticle interactions of surface-immobilized proteins (immunoglobulin G and bovine serum albumin, both involved in the formation of the corona) subjected to flowing SLN is demonstrated for non-chitosan-coated nanoparticles. All assayed nanosystems show more preference for IgG than for BSA, such preference being more pronounced in the case of polyvinyl-alcohol-coated SLN.",

            "text": "Moreover, the adsorption of HSA and fibrinogen was more noticeable on hydrophobic particles as compared to hydrophilic ones at the early stages of interaction (Cedervall et al., 2007). It was also reported that hydrophilic particles dramatically reduce the complement activation level (Shreffler et al., 2019), and that the protein corona affects the plasmatic half-time (Bertrand et al., 2017), cell uptake and biodistribution (Chinen et al., 2017), oxidative stress (Jayaram et al., 2017), toxicity (Corbo et al., 2016) and host immune response (Lee et al., 2015) of nanoparticles. This causes a consequent modulation of their in vivo behavior and pharmacological outcome. \n\nIn this context, Behzadi et al. investigated the potential effect of the biological environment on the release profile of drugs encapsulated in different types of polymeric nanoparticles, demonstrating that the leakage of the active compounds was decreased when the particle surface was decorated with the protein corona (Behzadi et al., 2014). These data demonstrate that the release profile of the entrapped compounds should be properly investigated following the formation of a protein coating in order to predict a real in vivo fate of the formulation. Another recent study performed by Alberg et al. evaluated the influence of the protein corona on the physico-chemical properties of three polymeric nanoparticles characterized by long-circulation properties as a consequence of the surface decoration with poly(N-2-hydroxypropylmethacrylamide) (PHPMA), polysarcosine (pSar), and PEG (Alberg et al., 2020). They showed that the mean sizes of the nanosystems was not increased after incubation with human plasma and only a negligible amount of proteins was adsorbed onto the polymeric nanocarriers. This suggests that an intensive corona formation is not a general property of nanoparticles. These results are in contrast with those reported in other investigations (Kokkinopoulou et al., 2017;Weber et al., 2018).",

            "text": "Currently, the design of anticancer therapeutics is focused on creating new systems with low toxicity, e.g., those based on nanocarriers, enabling targeted delivery and high efficiency of the treatment [1]. Usually, it is assumed that immediately after being introduced into the blood, nanoparticles (NPs) are surrounded by plasma proteins that form a biological coating around the individual NPs, known as the protein corona [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10]. Various characteristics of NPs (their size and shape, surface properties, etc.) have an influence on a formation mechanism of the protein corona [5,7]. In this respect, two categories of proteins can be distinguished: opsonins, which can increase the recognition of the reticuloendothelial system and, as a result, lead to a rapid elimination from the organism, and dysopsonins, which can improve the blood circulation time of NPs [9][10][11]. Therefore, when creating targeted drug delivery systems (DDS), knowledge about the protein-NP interaction mechanism can be crucial. \n\nUp until now, the formation of a protein corona was described for NPs based on polystyrene, gold, silica, and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), and was frequently used for masking other NPs [3,4,6,12]. Another way to increase the lifetime of NPs in the bloodstream is to create a particle with \"stealth\" properties. The \"stealth\" effect can be described as a phenomenon of preventing the adsorption of proteins onto NPs. It allows for prolonging blood clearance and reduces non-specific cellular uptake [2][3][4]. \n\nThe presence of strong or weak interactions between nanoparticles and proteins determines the possibility of the occurrence and the mechanism of the corona formation. The presence of a corona is an important factor in determining the effectiveness of a nanoparticle as a drug carrier [13].",

            "text": "When nanoparticles (NPs) enter a biological fluid, such as serum, proteins and peptides adsorb onto the particle's surface, forming a nanoparticle-protein corona (NPPC) complex [1][2][3]. The protein cloud develops a new surface on the nanoparticle, impacting the interactions between the nanoparticle and the surrounding environment. The NPPC complex assumes the characteristics of a core-shell particle system, where the pristine particle is the \"core\" and the corona is the \"shell\" [4]. This creates a new interface between the pristine particle and the surrounding biological fluid. The formation of a protein corona has been shown to change the particle's biological effects [5][6][7][8]. In addition to this change in the particle's characteristics, the adsorbed proteins have the potential to undergo conformational changes. Changes in either set of properties are especially important for nanomaterial drug products [9][10][11][12][13]. The cloak of proteins around particles in biological fluids has been shown to enhance or diminish a particle's specificity to a desired location, incite or inhibit its ability to permeate into a cell, and heighten or mitigate a biochemical response. When a protein corona forms, it is more likely to distribute and become available due to the nano-bio interface that forms around the surface of the nanoparticle. This protein cloud can change the biodistribution of the nanoparticle system depending on the biomolecular composition formed around the surface. Consequently, if the drug is reliant on specific proteins binding to the surface of the nanoparticle, then the particle could be translocated into an unintended location if non-targeted proteins form around the particle. \n\nResearch efforts in the field of nanotoxicology have strived to relate (or correlate) particle properties to adverse health effects. There now exists a substantial amount of published literature on this topic; however, there is no general consensus on identifying physicochemical characteristics as predictors of toxicological responses.",

            "text": "After administration of nanoparticles in the bloodstream, they are exposed to numerous proteins, which mainly determine the NPs' final physiological response. Proteins' adsorption on the surface of nanoparticles, called \"protein corona\", depends on many factors, such as the pH, size, shape, and charge of the nanoparticles [1]. The influence of nanoparticles' size on the protein corona formation is probably the most investigated effect, and the general stance is that the NPs with lower diameter adsorb higher amounts of proteins [2,3]. On the other hand, the investigations of the influence of the NPs' shape pointed out that the shape might influence the conformation state of the adsorbed protein, while the influence on the amount of adsorption was not investigated [4,5]. In addition, the surface charge of NPs plays a crucial role in protein adsorption, and recent data suggest that functionalizing of NPs with negatively charged molecules has certain advantages. While the positively charged NPs are rapidly recognized by opsonins and eliminated from the body, the negatively charged and neutral NPs are retained for a longer time; additional, investigated in detail by performing kinetic, thermodynamic, and adsorption studies. Additionally, the influence of adsorption on the conformation of BSA was investigated using fluorescence and synchronous fluorescence studies. The authors believe that the obtained results could contribute to the further improvement of AgNPs' performances, to the understanding of the biological effects and safe application of AgNPs in a biological milieu, and also to the understanding of their in vivo behavior contributing to potential preclinical research.",

The properties of such a particle-protein complex differ significantly from those of the formulated particle. Hence, the further biological responses of the body as well as the biodistribution of the nanoparticles are expected to be influenced by the nanoparticle-protein complex [34]. Therefore, the PLA nanoparticles were incubated with human blood plasma for several time points and we examined the binding of plasma proteins to the nanoparticles. The protein binding profiles were visualized by SDS-PAGE, demonstrating that an exposure for five minutes was already sufficient for an efficient corona formation ( Figure 7A). Also, the amount of corona proteins increased over time, albeit the corona seems to change only quantitatively rather than qualitatively. Furthermore, we examined the presence of apolipoproteins in the protein corona ( Figure 7B). Apolipoproteins are part of the circulating lipoproteins and serve as receptor ligands for lipid and cholesterol uptake and metabolism, and it was suggested that apolipoprotein-modified nanoparticles are able to transport drugs across the BBB [35][36][37][38]. We observed that apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and apolipoprotein A4 (ApoA4) are already present in the nanoparticle-protein complex after five minutes of exposure, and that the amount of ApoA4 slightly decreased and the ApoE concentrations significantly increased over time. The formation of the apolipoprotein corona on the PLA nanoparticles indicates a potential transport route of the nanoparticles through a lipoprotein receptor transcytosis pathway [37,39].",

            "text": "A basic understanding of physicochemical properties of NP which impact the adsorption of protein is decisive for the design and development of well-characterized nanomaterials.These distinctive nanomaterials may be implemented in a number of areas, from sensing, where they can be employed for the detection of several biomolecules [1][2][3], to biomedical engineering, where they are utilized for targeted drug delivery to cancerous tissues [4][5][6][7][8].NPs are very attractive in new healthcare implementations such as vaccinations [9,10], cancer diagnosis and therapy [11][12][13][14][15]. NPs display distinctive features in the human body, but there is only a limited knowledge of how these NPs interact with cells and biomolecules such as proteins.Depending on the NP dimension, pH of the medium, surface chemistry and type of NPs and proteins, proteins can mediate the formation of a corona at the external surface of NPs [16][17][18].The unique protein coronas of differently modified or differently sized NPs affect all features of NP -biological systems interactions ranging from induced cytotoxicity to the mechanism of infiltration [19][20][21][22][23]. NPs after uptaking by a physiological environment are coated with biomolecules almost spontaneously [24,25].The long-lived protein or short-lived protein layers adsorbed tightly or weakly on the NP surface are considered as the hardest coronas (HC) or softest coronas (SC), respectively [26,27].Hard protein corona compounds allocate the biological identity of the NPs and coronas trigger NP bioactivities such as membrane adhesion, infiltration mechanism, cellular signaling pathways, biodistribution, and protection [28][29][30][31].Not only the surface features and dimension of NPs and pH of the medium mediate their behavior in vivo, but also the type of proteins attached on the NP [32].",

            "text": "It is now widely accepted that upon contact of nanoparticles with biological fluid (e.g., blood plasma) proteins rapidly adsorb to the surface forming the biomolecular corona [1,2]. On one side, this process highly affects the physico-chemical properties of the nanoparticles and on the other side; it eventually determines their biological behaviour [3][4][5]. \n\nDepending on the nanoparticle system, a direct link between cellular interaction and specific protein was proven. For example, poly(butyl cyanoacrylate) nanoparticles which were coated with apolipoprotein E were able to cross the blood-brain barrier [6,7]. Recently, for example, the dynamic interaction of a single protein (influenza A hemagglutinin) and exosomes was studied by high-speed high-speed atomic force microscopy [8]. Next to this, due to corona formation, the colloid stability and biocompatibility of inorganic Au@Fe 3 O 4 Janus particles was enhanced [9]. In strong contrast to this, several reports recognized that protein adsorption can significantly influence the targeting properties of nanoparticles [10,11]. Here, it was shown that there was no cellular recognition of transferrin-functionalized nanoparticle after corona formation, meaning that the targeting ligands is completely covered up by plasma proteins [12]. Therefore, it is of urgent need to understand and control the interaction of nanoparticles upon contact with blood proteins in order to improve their therapeutic efficiency [13]. \n\nMost in vitro studies utilize serum or plasma to investigate protein adsorption on nanoparticles [14]. Depending on the specific protein source (human vs. mice or serum vs. plasma) [15] there have been significant difference noticed in terms of cellular interaction and protein corona composition [16,17]. Therefore, it is of great importance to always use the respective plasma source of the chosen organism for in vitro studies (e.g., mouse cells = mouse plasma, human cells = human plasma). Overall, the in vitro experiments give the opportunity to characterize general interaction between nanoparticles and proteins.",

When nanocarriers come into contact with serum, proteins immediately adsorb onto their surface, forming a protein corona which defines their biological identity. Although the composition of the protein corona has been widely determined by proteomics, its morphology still remains unclear. In this study we show for the first time the morphology of the protein corona using transmission electron microscopy. We are able to demonstrate that the protein corona is not, as commonly supposed, a dense, layered shell coating the nanoparticle, but an undefined, loose network of proteins. Additionally, we are now able to visualize and discriminate between the soft and hard corona using centrifugation-based separation techniques together with proteomic characterization. The protein composition of the \u223c15 nm hard corona strongly depends on the surface chemistry of the respective nanomaterial, thus further affecting cellular uptake and intracellular trafficking. Large diameter protein corona resulting from pre-incubation with soft corona or Apo-A1 inhibits cellular uptake, confirming the stealth-effect mechanism. In summary, the knowledge on protein corona formation, composition and morphology is essential to design therapeutic effective nanoparticle systems.",

            "text": "It is thought that the protein corona confers a nanoparticle its biological identity, whereby cellular interactions take place based on the abundance and conformation of proteins bound on the particle's surface, rather than the bare surface itself (Alkilany et al. 2009;Lundqvist et al. 2004).However the properties of the underlying AuNP -that is, its size, shape, surface charge and subsequent functionalisation are thought to have bearing on the eventual corona that forms (Fig 1) (Casals et al. 2011;Rahman et al. 2013).Using this knowledge, it may be possible to design AuNP based therapies which target specific cell types, cellular locations, or indeed, even evade cellular uptake by linking these material properties with coronal formation behavior.This Chapter therefore attempts to correlate the effect of modifications in AuNP size, shape and surface characteristics with protein corona formation.\n\nThe so-called protein corona is the term given to the protein rich coating that is formed at the nanoparticle surface, during a process which commences almost immediately upon the introduction of inorganic materials such as AuNPs to biological fluids (Casals et al. 2010a;Lynch et al. 2007;Mahmoudi et al. 2011).The immediate phase, which is often invoked within seconds, involves the creation of a soft corona (Fig 2).During this initial period, highly mobile proteins within the surrounding environment decorate the surface of the particle.Over a longer time scale, via means of Vroman's effect these initial proteins are displaced by others (Ehrenberg et al. 2009).In what is deemed the hard corona, proteins which possess greater affinity for the surface of the particle replace the loosely bound species to form a more stable complex.\n\nThis kinetic process ensures that the nature of the corona will transition over time, with respect to the species bound and their relative abundance on the surface.While initially several hundred protein species may compete for a place on the particle's surface as part of the soft corona, it is thought that the hard corona has a more simplified composition, comprising of approximately 10-50 different proteins (Mahmoudi et al. 2011).",

Additionally, human plasma was depleted of immunoglobulins (IgG) as previously described. 29 'IgG depleted plasma' was isolated from human plasma via affinity chromatography using a Protein A column. The protein composition was determined by LC-MS and we were able to reduce the total amount of IgG from 28% down to 4% (Fig. S1 \u2020). Then, carboxy-and amino functionalized PS-NPs were incubated with IgG depleted plasma and characterized before and after incubation regarding size and \u03b6-potential (Table 1 and Fig. S2 \u2020). \n\nDynamic light scattering experiments (DLS) indicate a minor size increase (\u223c20 nm) after protein coating, which is attributed to protein corona formation. 29,33 Additional transmission electron microscopy images (TEM) confirmed the protein layer surrounding the nanoparticles as found in previous reports 33 (Fig. 1A). To characterize the biological identity of nanoparticles after protein coating, the exact protein corona composition was identified by LC-MS (Fig. 1B and C). \n\nTherefore, nanoparticles were incubated with IgG depleted plasma to allow corona formation, and afterwards centrifuged and washed (see material/methods). 9 As shown before, the surface functionalization of the nanoparticles strongly influences the protein adsorption pattern. 34,35 Coated carboxy-functionalized nanoparticles (PS-COOH) were surrounded by a protein layer, which was strongly enriched by fibrinogen (\u223c74%).

The particle size (i.e., surface curvature) influences the adsorption and binding strength of proteins to the particle, as well as the structural changes in adsorbed proteins, with these effects depending on the specific electrostatic properties of nanoparticles and proteins involved, as reviewed in this section. In particular, nanoparticle surfaces have recently been modified by attaching charged or hydrophilic molecules that can attract specific plasma proteins, thereby controlling the composition of the protein corona [68][69][70][71].",

The peaks on the DLS fractograms of nanoparticles incubated with plasma over the range of the retention times between 10 and 20 min are likely to be plasma proteins, suggested by an overlay of the chromatogram of 20% human plasma (Supplementary Figure S17). LNP-RNP particles show a significantly higher derived count rate after incubation with plasma (Figure 2D). These results indicate that these LNP do interact with the plasma components, suggesting formation of a protein corona on the surface of the LNP [32].

Here, we discuss the mechanistic parameters that are involved in the protein corona formation and the consequences of this corona formation for both, the particle, and the protein. We review consequences of corona formation for colloidal stability and discuss the role of functional groups and NP surface functionalities in shaping NP\u2013protein interactions. We also elaborate the recent advances demonstrating the strong involvement of Coulomb-type interactions between NPs and charged patches on the protein surface. Moreover, we discuss novel aspects related to the complexity of the protein corona forming under physiological conditions in full serum. Specifically, we address the relation between particle size and corona composition and the latest findings that help to shed light on temporal evolution of the full serum corona for the first time. Finally, we discuss the most recent advances regarding the molecular-scale mechanistic role of the protein corona in cellular uptake of NPs.",

Furthering the knowledge on the corona formed on NP exposed to mouse serum proteins can help in understanding what role it might have in in vivo studies at systemic, tissue, and cellular levels. To investigate biocorona formation, different sized polystyrene NP were exposed to mouse serum. Our data show a size- and time-dependent protein and lipid corona formation. Several proteins were identified and apolipoproteins were by far the most common group on the NPs surfaces. Moreover, we observed that cholesterol and triglycerides effectively bind to NP emphasizing that proteins are not the only biomolecules with high-affinity binding to nanomaterial surfaces. These results highlight that further knowledge on NP interactions with mouse serum is necessary regarding the common use of this model to predict the in vivo efficiency of NP.",

Although the presence of these protein crowns significantly reduced the cellular uptake of amphiphilic assemblies, they also significantly reduced the cytotoxic and hemolytic effects resulting from the contact of NPs with living cells [129]. The ability to control protein corona formation with ligand molecules has been used to regulate the intracellular activation of nanoenzymes through endosomal proteolysis of coronal proteins [130]. Nanoparticles modified with transition metal catalysts (nanozymes) were created to generate both \"hard\" irreversible and \"soft\" reversible coronas in serum. The hard corona induced nanozyme aggregation, effectively inhibiting nanozyme activity. However, only a modest loss of activity was observed with the nonaggregating soft corona nanozymes [131]. \n\nAdditional research focusing on nanoparticle surface design and the use of orthogonal chemistry will further elucidate the dynamic process of protein biocrown formation, its composition, and the potential for future nanomedicine.

            "text": "2][3] Inside the body, nanoparticles (NPs) non-specifically adsorb blood proteins (forming the so-called protein corona) which end up masking the outermost surface of the engineered NPs and represent one of the main mistargeting reasons. 4- 7 Furthermore, the protein corona is prone to induce NPs aggregation, limiting their ultimate application since the overall surface-area is drastically changed, reducing their biological outcome. 8][19][20] However, the colossal complexity behind these studies dealing simultaneously with NPs, protein coronas, and biological systems has made them rely on model systems where concentrations and conditions are far from those envisaged in real bloodstream applications. This strategy has definitively boosted an exponential advance on \"quasi-ideal\" protein corona understanding at the same time that these findings have found significant limitations in being correlated with medical reality resulting in low bench-to-market translation. 18,21 In addition, the desire for obtaining ideal systems for protein corona studies has somehow prevented an in-depth understanding of the ultimate role of this protein shell on triggering or preventing NPs aggregation in biological fluids. 8,12,22 This fact associated with the difficulty of distinguishing between protein corona and NPs aggregation has prevented a broader understanding and the possibility of establishing any correlation between these two phenomena. Also, the techniques and strategies currently available are usually more suitable for studying either protein corona or NPs aggregation. 12,23,24 Although many reports have tried to draw a correlation between protein corona and NPs aggregation, the amount of information is still sparse, and the correlation between them is not obvious. 22,25,26 ][32][33][34] Here we report an innovative experimental design that spans over an extensive proteinto-particle concentration range and provides an entire picture that considers protein corona formation and NPs partial or massive aggregation states close to natural medical conditions. Silica nanoparticles of ~ 25 nm were first synthesized and later incubated in buffers at distinct ionic strengths with either bovine albumin serum, bovine \u03b3-globulin, chicken egg lysozyme, or fetal bovine serum.",

The same trend was then observed with silica NPs by Satzer et al, who found that both BSA and myoglobulin were significantly denatured, when adsorbed in the corona of particles with size >150 nm (Satzer et al., 2016). Collectively, these studies on gold NPs and silica NPs, provide evidence that larger F I G U R E 5 Schematic representation of the effect of particle size on the formation of protein corona particles cause a more significant denaturation of the PC. This effect also plays an important role in the design of nanomaterials and in the ability to predict their physicochemical properties in biologically relevant media. For example, the presence of exposed hydrophobic regions in the structure of denatured proteins may facilitate further adsorption of proteins, thus, enriching the already existing PC and mediating the formation of a multilayer corona (Meersman & Heremans, 2003). \n\nAlthough the effect of particle size on the number of proteins adsorbed on the PC have been widely reported, the effects of particle size on the composition of the PC, especially on the diversity of proteins, are still the object of interesting studies. A pioneering work by Lundqvist et al. showed that neutral polystyrene NPs, with a size 50 or 100 nm, led to the formation of a highly homologous PC (homology >80%; Lundqvist et al., 2008). However, in the case of amineor carboxyl-functionalized polystyrene particles, the formed corona presented much lower level of homology (50%) between 50 and 100 nm size, suggesting that surface chemistry, and not NP size, plays a major role in determining PC composition.",

The development of a protein corona affects the chemical and physical characteristics of LNPs, increasing the hydrodynamic diameter and modifying the charge on the surface. Nevertheless, all protein coronas contained different patterns of proteins related with the immune response, the metabolism of lipids and the transport capacity, to modulate, in diverse ways, LNP-cell interactions [116]. The initial physicochemical characteristics, including particle size, surface properties, composition, and structure, predominantly determine the biological fate of LNPs within the gastrointestinal tract. Absorption primarily takes place in the small intestine. Notably, LNPs can be categorized as either digestible or indigestible based on their composition, resulting in two distinct biological paths for LNPs. Digestible LNPs undergo digestion initiated by lipases and subsequent hydrolysis across the GI tract upon ingestion. This process leads to the breakdown of lipids, resulting in lipid digestion products rich in fatty acids and monoglycerides. These products, along with encapsulated drugs, bile salts, and phospholipids, form mixed micelles. After absorption by enterocytes, these lipid digestion products and encapsulated drugs enter the systemic circulation through either the portal vein or the lymphatic system. The specific route taken depends on the lipid structure within the LNP formulation and the hydrophobic nature of the encapsulated drugs. Alternatively, indigestible LNPs can remain intact and potentially penetrate the mucus layer to reach epithelial surfaces. After penetration, these LNPs can be transported through the tight junction, or absorbed up by enterocytes or transported by M cells, to enter the circulation [117].",

            "text": "Progress in nanotechnology has led to the development of nanoparticles (NPs) with a wide range of applications in sensing [1], catalysis [2], and nanomedicine [3]. The use of nanomaterials as drug delivery systems, in particular, offers potential advantages such as improved stability and solubility of drugs [4], promoted drug transport across membranes [5], and site-specific targeting of therapeutics [6]. However, the application of NPs in clinical settings remains challenging, due to the potential issues with their long-term toxicity [7], and interactions with biomolecules such as proteins [8,9], lipids [10,11], sugars [12], and oligonucleotides [13]. In particular, protein corona formation has been shown to alter the morphology and structure of NPs, impacting on bioavailability [14,15], toxicity [16,17], and targeting [18][19][20][21][22], all factors that can affect their applications. However, recent data have highlighted how protein corona formation can also be tailored to become an advantage. Kim et al. modified the chemistry of DNA nanostructures to form an apolipoprotein-enriched protein corona, able to target liver tissue for the treatment of fibrosis [23]. Mosquera et al. used an external stimulus to control protein corona formation on gold NPs, to influence their cellular internalization in vitro [14]. Moreover, the study of nanoparticle-protein interactions has led to interesting applications in the development of sensors [24]. Thus, understanding how the chemistry and morphology of nanomaterials can be used to control the formation of protein corona is essential for developing successful applications. \n\nStudies of protein corona formation have traditionally involved the isolation of NPsprotein complexes prior to analysis [25,26], resulting in only the strongest interactions being evaluated, using a broad range of analytical techniques [27]. This is often referred to as the hard corona.",

            "text": "Also, due to differences in the surface modification of chemical groups, the formation and composition of the protein corona were different. Proteins quickly coated the surface of the original MWCNT and MWCNT-COOH and made them more compact than MWCNT-PEG, and these compact forms were more effective in protecting cells from the MWCNT surface. Further investigation showed that hydrophobicity was the main reason for the increase in the cellular uptake of the original MWCNTs. However, the protein corona filled with dysoposnins was the major reason for the low uptake of MWCNT-COOH in RAW264.7 cells. The protein corona on MWCNT reduced the exposure of the surface to the medium and limited interactions with cells. As a result, fewer ROS or inflammatory cytokines were produced. Hence, protein binding played a key role in reducing toxicity (Zhang et al., 2019). \n\nSome studies have also shown that the number and types of proteins adsorbed on the surface of NPs are closely related to the properties of NPs. Li et al. synthesised several NPs with similar shapes, sizes, and surface characteristics but different elasticity (45 kPa-760 MPa). After mixing these NPs with mouse plasma, they found that the composition of the protein corona formation changed non-monotonically with the increase in the elasticity of the NPs (Li et al., 2022). For example, apolipoprotein AI was more likely to form the corona protein over NPs of intermediate elasticity (75-700 kPa). Cheng et al. found that changing the components of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) can make LNPs absorb specific proteins in the blood and target specific organs (Cheng et al., 2020). \n\nThe research team undertook a study to ascertain the relationship between the ligand-protein corona and its biological effects, utilizing Pearson's correlation coefficient analysis. They delved into the impact of the protein corona on how particles are internalised and the subsequent macrophage immune response. \n\nTheir findings revealed that the surface chemistry of AuNRs played a role in determining the protein corona's composition.",

Undoubtedly, this protein (biological macromolecule) can mask several physicochemical properties (such as the surface charge and solubility) of nanoparticles and make them recognizable to the immune system, which may neutralize them before they reach the target site [65]. The covering of nanoparticles with these proteins largely determines their biological identities and further fate-their distribution through tissues and organs, their rate of excretion from the body, and their opsonization (phagocytosis involving membrane receptors). This is the key factor causing differences in the performance of nanoparticles within in vitro and in vivo [66] studies, where nanoparticles indicate good results in the first case and usually are worse or non-effective in living organisms [67,68]. \n\nHowever, the composition, density, and mechanism of formation of this macromolecular layer depends not only on the physicochemical characteristics of the nanoparticles, association/dissociation constants, competitive binding processes, and species of proteins in the biological medium but also on where the nanoparticle is located [69,70]. \n\nThe formation of this protein corona depends not only on the composition of the nanoparticle-its size, shape, surface state, and exposure time-but also on the type of media, the nanoparticle-to-protein ratio, and the presence of ions and other molecular species that interfere in the interaction between proteins and nanoparticles [71]. \n\nCareful modulation of the protein corona through the tuning of intrinsic and extrinsic parameters may allow nanoparticles to be delivered optimally in tumor tissue [72].",

            "text": "Nanoparticles are prone to interact with a myriad of biomolecules present in the bloodstream when delivered in vivo. This process usually generates two layers of proteins that are adsorbed onto the NPs' surface, namely hard and soft corona. The analysis and isolation of such adsorbed proteins have revealed that corona composition may change over time until reaching an equilibrium state [60] and is mainly composed of abundant proteins such as albumin and other less abundant ones that tend to interact selectively with the NPs' surface [41,61]. Interestingly, the presence of this corona layer may produce significant changes in their biological activity affecting the long-term fate of NPs. Consequently, a full understanding of the effect of such corona on the stability of NPs is essential for the appropriate design of nanotherapeutics. The formation of PC NPs between polymeric NPs (e.g., PLGA and PLGA-PEG) with plasma proteins (FBS), their biophysical characterization, and isolation have been reported [60,[62][63][64][65][66]. In these studies, NPs were mainly prepared via solvent emulsification-diffusion methods [66] using PVA as a stabilizer together with the use of high-energy methods (e.g., ultracentrifugation or high-speed homogenizer). \n\nThe adsorption process of serum proteins, as well as other kind of model proteins onto the surface of PLGA NPs prepared by nano-emulsion templates and low-energy methods, have been recently reported. These studies evaluated the colloidal stabilities of such PC NPs in the presence of different serum concentrations [64,65] as well the formation, isolation, and analysis of proteins adsorbed on the surface of different functionalized polymeric NPs using high-resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS) [41,62,63,66].",

            "text": "AuNS demonstrate higher enhancement factors than other shapes at their resonance wavelengths, enabling zeptomol detection [14,[23][24][25]. \n\nAlthough GNP designs and functional uses are rapidly developing, little is known about the changes that nanoparticles undergo and how they behave in complex biological systems. We know that interactions with different proteins in the cellular environment result in the formation of the \"protein corona\" (PC)-a layer of proteins formed around a nanoparticle. A PC can be characterized as \"hard\" or \"soft\", depending on the strength of protein adhesion (often dependent on the distance from the surface) to the nanoparticle's surface [26,27]. The PC formation on the GNPs induces variations in the SERS enhancement of the particles due to aggregation and morphology changes and simply precluding analyte binding to \"hot spots\". The PC also influences the targeting efficiency of the nanoparticles [28]. Literature reports suggest that less than 5% of the GNPs injected into a biological system reach targeted organs [29,30], due to aggregation, shape altering and surface chemistry changes to the particles and to the natural bio-distribution of GNPs into each organ [31,32]. Considering possible particle accumulation, toxicity also becomes important [33][34][35][36][37]. \n\nProtein binding to the GNP surface is a complex process that is affected by the structural properties of the protein [36,[38][39][40], and the size, shape and surface chemistry of the GNPs [41,42]. It may result in conformational changes of the protein. As the PC becomes the outer surface of the GNPs, it modulates the bio-identity of GNPs, and hence, their overall pharmacological and toxicological profiles. The investigation of protein interactions with GNPs is therefore an important step towards any biomedical application. \n\nIn this study, we first report the reproducible synthesis of anionic, citrate-capped spheroidal and ascorbate-capped star-shaped GNPs, which was required in order to be able to undertake a reliable protein corona study.",

            "text": "Background: When nanoparticles (NPs) are applied into a biological fluid, such as blood, proteins bind rapidly to their surface forming a so-called \u201cprotein corona\u201d. These proteins are strongly attached to the NP surface and confers them a new biological identity that is crucial for the biological response in terms of body biodistribution, cellular uptake, and toxicity. The corona is dynamic in nature and it is well known that the composition varies in dependence of the physicochemical properties of the NPs. In the present study we investigated the protein corona that forms around poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) NPs at different serum concentrations using two substantially different serum types, namely fetal bovine serum (FBS) and human serum. The corona was characterized by means of sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), Bradford protein assay, zeta potential measurements, and liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS/MS). Additionally, the time-dependent cell interaction of PLGA NPs in the absence or presence of a preformed protein corona was assessed by in vitro incubation experiments with the human liver cancer cell line HepG2. Results: Our data revealed that the physiological environment critically affects the protein adsorption on PLGA NPs with significant impact on the NP\u2013cell interaction. Under comparable conditions the protein amount forming the protein corona depends on the serum type used and the serum concentration. On PLGA NPs incubated with either FBS or human serum a clear difference in qualitative corona protein composition was identified by SDS-PAGE and LC\u2013MS/MS in combination with bioinformatic protein classification. In the case of human serum a considerable change in corona composition was observed leading to a concentration-dependent desorption of abundant proteins in conjunction with an adsorption of high-affinity proteins with lower abundance. Cell incubation experiments revealed that the respective corona composition showed significant influence on the resulting nanoparticle\u2013cell interaction. Conclusion: Controlling protein corona formation is still a challenging task and our data highlight the need for a rational future experimental design in order to enable a prediction of the corona formation on nanoparticle surfaces",

            "text": "Most of the colloidal suspensions tend to adsorb proteins on their surface when they are inserted into a biological fluid, thus leading to the formation of a superficial layer of proteins known as protein-corona. 1 The protein-corona can have a crucial impact on the stability of colloidal suspensions, avoiding the agglomeration of nanoparticles (NPs) and controlling their active surface area, which determine the diffusion characteristics of NPs. 2 Protein-corona can also alter the physiological properties of the NPs and their interaction with other molecules once in contact with the biological environment, 3,4 affecting the process of cellular uptake. 5,6 Mazzolini et al. 7 have demonstrated that lung-derived cells uptake of ceria NPs coated with serum proteins can be improved and a lower cytotoxic effect was evidenced. Depending on the NP size, chemistry or surface potential, the proteins can have different affinity for the NP surface, leading to the formation of a hard or a soft protein-corona, 8 which are defined by different dissociation constant, it being higher for the hard protein-corona, with respect to soft one. 9,10 The wettability properties of the NPs can also affect the formation of protein-corona by changing its relative affinity, association, and dissociation rates. 11 n this study, we investigate the formation of the proteincorona on aluminum doped zinc oxide (ZnO) and gallium nitride (GaN) semiconductor NPs by using bovine serum albumin (BSA). This choice takes into account the fact that among all the proteins present in human plasma, albumin is the most abundant one and is vital for the maintenance of plasma colloidal osmotic pressure and transport of certain drugs and nutrients. 12 ][15] The use of semiconductor NPs in biomedical applications has been actively explored in the last period, especially due to the potential utilization of NPs in controlled drug delivery and better imaging systems. Nevertheless, the knowledge about the interaction of NPs at biomolecular level is still rather limited and the subject requires deeper investigations. \n\nThe ability to remotely control the physical, chemical, or biological properties of some nanomaterials (NMs) using electromagnetic fields opens the way to the development of novel applications in nanomedicine.",

            "text": "The development of nanotechnology is opening a new avenue of research on drug-loading nanocarriers. By virtue of their unique physicochemical properties and biocompatibility, a wide variety of nanoparticles (NPs) like liposomes 1 , metaleorganic framework 2,3 , polymeric nanoparticles 4,5 and magnetic nanoparticles 6 have been reported to improve the therapeutic effect 7,8 . Multiple functions were designed and confirmed in these innovative NPs and great experimental outcomes were shown as well. \n\nHowever, only few of the NPs under development have processed into clinical or market up to now 9,10 . It is believed that the complicated in vivo environment may be the one to blame. When administrated in vivo, the NPs are exposed to complicated and diversified biological fluids with different pH, abundant biomolecules and immune cells, which dramatically impacts the biodistribution, metabolism, cellular internalization, and toxicity of administrated NPs 11 . Furthermore, the administration routes of NPs were diversified, and the biological environment the NPs exposed to varied from one disease to another. Hence, the specific physiological conditions must be taken into account when studying the NPs fate. \n\nAmong them, tremendous attentions have been paid to the formation of protein corona, a phenomenon where biomolecules in biological fluids like proteins inevitably bind to the surface of NPs and change the biological identity of the pristine NPs 12,13 . The surface identities of NPs will be more similar to that of proteins after the formation of protein corona. The in vivo fate of NPs with new identities endowed by protein corona may be less predictable 14 . It was reported that the NPs with protein corona may be eliminated by the mononuclear phagocytic system more quickly 15 , while other studies suggested that the protein adsorption may decrease the NPsecell membrane adhesion and reduces the cell uptake 16 . Moreover, the biodistribution, biodegradation, pharmacokinetics and drug release profile were also be proved to be affected by the protein corona 13,17,18 . Thus, the formation of protein corona and its impacts are considered one of the keystones to the gap between in vitro design and in vivo therapeutic effect.",

            "text": "The structure of PC is determined by the kinetic and equilibrium binding of protein with a nanoparticle, which depends on the medium composition and on the nanoparticles' properties, such as size, surface charge, surface composition, and functionality. (Lundqvist et al., 2011;Mahmoudi et al., 2013;Ritz et al., 2015;Lee, 2017). However, despite the extensive studies and the known influence of the NP physicochemical properties in the formation of the PC, only a few reports pay attention and focus on the influence of the NP roughness and pores in the formation of the PC, which is one of the keys in the final physiological response of the nanoparticle. (Ma et al., 2014;Gao et al., 2016). \n\nHerein, we have developed a new method to study on how the porosity of the nanoparticle affects the formation of the PC. For this purpose, nano-DSC and ITC techniques will be used. As model NP's, mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) have been chosen due to their wide application on drug delivery and their synthetic versatility (Ibrahim et al., 2010;Tu et al., 2016). Human serum albumin (HSA) Peng et al. (2013) and lysozymes have been used as protein models because of their presence in the human plasma and their different sizes (69 and 34 \u00c5, respectively). The methodology proposed in this article could be used in general to a more complete characterization of the protein corona formation process with a great variety of nanoparticles.

This is since protein adsorption is mediated (in part) by hydrophobic interactions. 57 As demonstrated by Maiorano et al. utilising Dulbecco's Modi\ue103ed Eagle medium (DMEM) and Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium (RPMI), supplemented with Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), bio\ue104uid composition is a prominent extrinsic in\ue104uencer of corona formation. The two media (which vary in their salt, glucose and amino acid content) induced dissimilar adsorption patterns, with citrate-stabilised gold nanoparticles gaining a more abundant and stable corona in DMEM at all tested sizes. 58 Consistently, an increase in plasma concentration (from 3% to 80%) corresponded to a notable increase in protein adsorption for polystyrene nanoparticles. For silica nanoparticles, increasing plasma concentration instead induced considerable changes in the protein pattern, illustrative of competitive adsorption by less-abundant, high-affinity proteins due to enhanced adhesion at higher plasma concentrations. 59 Finally, nanoparticles which interact with proteins electrostatically have been reported to experience pH-dependent corona formation by reason of an altered protein binding affinity. 60 The instantaneous adsorption of proteins by nanoparticles may alter their physicochemical attributes (including size and surface charge), thereby providing them with a new biological identity. Thus, it is not pristine nanoparticles, but those which are biomolecule-coated that largely govern physiological responses such as systemic circulation time, bioavailability, cellular uptake and cytotoxicity. 61 For instance, the formation of a protein corona around transferrin-functionalised silicon dioxide nanoparticles was shown to eliminate their transferrinmediated targeting capability due to masked receptor-binding sites (Fig. 3). In another study, the coating of gold nanoparticles with polyacrylic acid was shown to cause the unfolding of adsorbed \ue103brinogen which, consequently, evoked an in\ue104ammatory cascade. 11 By",

            "text": "The adsorption of proteins on the surface of nanoparticles when they come in contact with the protein rich environment plays a vital role in deciding the fate of NPs. Several studies have described the role of protein adsorption in biological interactions [84] and have stated that \"Protein corona\" refers to the spontaneous self-assembly or biomolecular coating of the proteins on the surface of nanoparticles [85]. The formation of corona not only alters the physical properties of the nanomaterials such as size, surface charge, shape but also alerts the immune system of the body to recognize the nanoparticles as an intruder and hastens the process of opsonization [86]. Having said that, it becomes important to identify various characterization techniques to detect the extent of protein corona formation. Though several techniques such as quantitative and qualitative proteomic assays have been described to characterize the protein corona formation of the nanoparticles [87], very few studies have reported on its formation around BP nanomaterials. Here, we have discussed the techniques available to characterize the formation of protein corona around the BP nanomaterials. \n\nElectron microscopies, such as TEM, provide a clear picture of protein corona formation around the nanoparticles. For instance, in a previous study [88], the size of BPNSs was increased by 11.9 nm after being covered by plasma proteins and, in another study, the size increased by 30 nm [89]. The corona formation can also be detected by a change in surface charge. The surfaces of BPNSs coated with plasma proteins were entirely different from the native form and the charge changed to a positive value from negative. Liquid chromatography with a mass spectrometry detector was used to qualitatively analyze the components of the BP-corona complex. The results revealed that the binding of proteins to BP directly depends on the protein size and, additionally, the BPNSs mainly bind with immune relevant proteins. The composition of the protein corona can also be evaluated using Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).",

There is a consensus that the outer surface of nanomaterials within biological systems is essentially covered by a protein corona as a result of non-specific adsorption and protein interactions. Furthermore, cellular and tissue responses of the nanomaterials depend on these corona compositions, which in turn have been demonstrated to be influenced by parameters such as size, shape, temperature, pH, surface charge, surface functional groups, and hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity of the nanoparticles (Gossmann et al., 2015;Yallapu et al., 2015). Even protein corona repellant membrane-wrapped nanoparticles have resulted in a non-specific protein adsorption (corona formation). However, selective cellular uptake of these nanoparticles has been observed in antigen presenting cells (Xu et al., 2016). Furthermore, the adsorption and unfolding of a single bovine serum albumin protein was found to trigger nanoparticle aggregation (Dominguez-Medina et al., 2016). Therefore, protein adsorption and associated conformation changes can play a major role in determining nanoparticle stability.",

            "text": "Once injected in a biological fluid, such as blood plasma, nanoparticles (NPs) are rapidly coated with a layer of proteins forming the so-called \"protein corona\" [57,58] in a dynamic process which does not reach the thermodynamic equilibrium [59]. The corona is typically composed of a \"hard\" portion formed by a thin inner layer of more closely bound proteins, and a \"soft\" outer layer with less tightly bound and fast exchanging proteins. Hydrophobic interactions, electrostatic interactions, van der Waals interactions, hydrogen bonds, and \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking can contribute in various degree to NP-protein interaction depending on the nature of both nanomaterials and protein media. The protein corona represents the new and dynamic NP interface with the external environment. Experimental studies investigating the nature and composition of the protein corona presented disparate outcomes, both because of the variety of NP and because of the different analytical methods used. A set of 125 plasma proteins has been found to associate with nanomaterials [60], and among these albumin, immunoglobulins, apolipoprotein A-I, and complement components have been frequently found in the nanomaterial corona [61]. If the proteins forming the corona undergo conformational changes with respect to their native structure, their functionality may be impaired, and their regular biological activity may be altered, causing abnormal interactions with other blood components [62]. Thus, the global NP-protein system is responsible for potential adverse events in the cardiovascular system, including thrombosis, complement and leukocyte activation, and hemolysis. Opsonization by complement components and immunoglobulins can, for example, cause the activation of the immune system and receptor-mediated phagocytosys, influencing the rapidity of clearance from the blood stream and/or the biodistribution in different target organs. The blood protein corona has also effects on NP dispersion/aggregation, as well as on circulation time, biodistribution and targeting efficiency of nanomedicines [63], and in some cases was hypothesized to contribute protecting RBC membrane from lysis [64].

            "text": "In the past few decades, it has been well shown that the protein corona formation on nanoparticles' surfaces influences their in vivo fate and may significantly interfere with the targeting yields, biodistribution, and cell internalization of nano-delivery systems [33,34]. Additionally, many research studies have confirmed that PC formation and evolution generally depend on nanoparticle properties, such as: size, surface charge, morphology, hydrophobicity, and the presence of ligands [35]. Therefore, it was important to obtain relevant information regarding the interactions between the prepared nano-carriers and human plasma proteins, in order to predict the process of PC formation in vivo. For this purpose, samples containing PEG (NLPEG and NLCPEG), nano-carriers covered with POL (NLPOL and NLCPOL), and formulations with no PEG or POL in the content (NL0 and NLC0) were prepared and incubated for 1 h in human plasma from healthy volunteers. The results from the protein adsorption studies are given in Table 2. From the results presented in Table 2, it can be concluded that the formulations prepared with no stealth polymer on their surface tended to have a significantly higher % of plasma protein adsorption (p = 0.0031 and p = 0.0290 for NL and NLC, respectively; p < 0.05; ANOVA) compared to the formulations containing PEG (NLPEG and NLCPEG) or POL (NLPOL and NLCPOL). The obtained results were expected, since PEGylation has been a traditionally used method for reducing the interaction of nanoparticles with plasma proteins [21,36]. Similar to PEG, the hydrophilic blocks of POL on the hydrophobic surfaces of lipid nanoparticles are capable of forming a hydrophilic barrier for protein adsorption, resulting in reduced mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) uptake and thus achieving a prolonged blood circulation time [20,[37][38][39].\n\nOn the other hand, it was revealed that there were no statistically significant differences between the percentage of the adsorbed plasma proteins onto the formulations covered with PEG (p = 0.1448; p < 0.05; t-test) and POL (",

Adsorption of biomolecules such as proteins is an inevitable process that takes place instantaneously upon contact with physiological fluid (e.g. blood). Therefore, strategies are needed to control this process in order to improve the properties of the nanoparticles and to allow targeted drug delivery. Here, we show that the design of the protein corona by a pre-formed protein corona with tailored properties enables targeted cellular interactions. Nanoparticles were pre-coated with immunoglobulin depleted plasma to create and design a protein corona that reduces cellular uptake by immune cells. It was proven that a pre-formed protein corona remains stable even after nanoparticles were re-introduced to plasma. This opens up the great potential to exploit protein corona formation, which will significantly influence the development of novel nanomaterials.",

            "text": "This phenomenon has been observed to interfere with NPs' antimicrobial activity, as the formation of a protein corona around the NPs, even in NPs exposed to culture media, has been shown to diminish their antibacterial activity. 139 Proteomic studies have identi\ue103ed common proteins that bind to NPs, including a-1-antiproteinase, a-2-HS-glycoprotein, apolipoprotein A-I, A-II, C-III, keratin, type II cytoskeletal, keratin type II cytoskeletal, and serum albumin. The presence of these proteins in the corona, similar to those found in serum, has been implicated in diminishing the antibacterial activity of NPs. This research 137 sheds light on the complex interinvolve among NPs, EPS, and microbial defence mechanisms, highlighting the potential impact of the protein corona on the antimicrobial activity of NPs. Understanding these interactions is crucial for developing effective strategies for applying NPs in antimicrobial and environmental contexts. Fig. 5 offers a comprehensive overview of the complex interactions among nanoparticles (NPs) and biological systems, focusing on forming protein coronas. The protein corona refers to the layer of proteins that adsorbs onto the surface of NPs when they enter a biological environment. This phenomenon has both advantages and disadvantages, clearly delineated in the image. On the disadvantage side, protein coronas may mask the intended functionality of NPs and potentially trigger unwanted immune responses, which could limit their therapeutic efficacy or cause adverse effects. However, the advantages are signi\ue103cant: precoating NPs with speci\ue103c proteins may help them escape immune recognition and prevent aggregation, improving their circulation time and stability. \n\nMoreover, this coating may upgrade targeting speci\ue103city, allowing NPs to reach their intended destinations more effectively. The ability to capture amyloids associated with various neurodegenerative diseases is another notable advantage. 141 he central green sphere represents the NP, surrounded via multiple elements that may be manipulated to control protein corona formation, including speci\ue103c ligands, surface charges, hydrophilic groups, and polymers.",

The addition of an anionic lipid reduced pK a , whereas the addition of a cationic lipid increased pK a , which affected the interaction with plasma proteins and the formation of the protein corona (Dilliard et al., 2021). Results of their proteomic analysis of the protein corona suggested that targeting to the liver takes place with predominance of the ApoE protein in the protein corona; to lungs, with predominance of the \u03b22-GPI protein; and to the spleen, with predominance of the VTN protein. Incubation of these proteins with the LNPs in vitro also enabled specific LNP targeting (Dilliard et al., 2021). \n\nThose authors proposed a three-stage mechanism underlying the targeting of a five-component LNP (Dilliard et al., 2021). The first stage is the dissociation of the PEGylated lipid from the surface of LNPs; the second is the binding of SORT-lipid to blood proteins; and the third stage is the binding of proteins (adhering to the  Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org 09 particle) to tissue-specific receptors. In the case of PEG with a longer aliphatic anchor, which shows worse desorption, the expression of the reporter protein in all organs was noticeably lower, thus confirming the above mechanism. In another study (Meyer et al., 2022), LNPs containing a positively charged group of the additional lipid and a PLGA polymer also got distributed into lungs and the spleen, and the distribution was influenced by the ratio of a cationic lipid (DOTAP) to an ionizable lipid (MC3).",

            "text": "). Protein coronas can concentrate proteins known as opsonins, such as complement proteins, coagulation proteins, and antibodies. Opsonins stimulate immune cell recognition and facilitate rapid clearance of nanoparticles from the bloodstream by immune cells such as macrophages [17,[39][40][41][42][43]. Opsonic properties are also shared by proteins involved in lipid transport such as apolipoprotein A-I and apolipoprotein E [41]. Alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein can act as an opsonin, enhancing macrophage-deactivating mechanisms [44]. Apolipoproteins or other proteins with dysopsonin-like properties, such as histidine-rich glycoprotein, clusterin (apolipoprotein J), and albumin, which are present in protein coronas of nanoparticles (Table 1, column 4), may prolong the time that nanoparticles circulate in blood [41].\n\nInterestingly, protein coronas have also been identified on nanoparticles whose surface has been chemically modified, e.g., through the attachment of hydrophilic polymers such as polyethylene glycol (Table 1, rows 3, 4, and 7), which is useful to lengthen blood circulation times and to decrease the hepatic uptake of the nanoparticles. Protein coronas have been described for nanoparticles both in vivo (as discussed) as well as in vitro (Table 1).\n\nNanoparticles in biological environments including saliva, lung fluid, and blood have been found to interact with phospholipids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and other metabolites, in addition to proteins and peptides [10,45,46]. As a result, a layer of biomolecules (biocorona) may end up coating the nanoparticles' surface giving nanoparticles a new biological identity [26,[30][31][32][33]36,47]. Ultimately, the biocorona mediates interactions between the nanoparticle and the host biological system [15,[30",

            "text": "Robust characterization of nanomaterials and biological fluids together with accurate methodological approaches to study the formation and subsequent analysis of the protein corona are essential steps in achieving a robust literature database towards designing NP-based therapeutics with higher translatability into clinical practice. Our comprehensive overview of the current protein corona literature on various types of NPs reveals the need for conducting studies with more robustness NP characterization, improving experimental repeats, and using methodologies that minimizes protein contamination and nanoparticle aggregation during the protein corona formation and collection processes. The NP corona formation in each class of nanomaterials has utmost importance specially if there is a potential of translation into a product. For example, amongst all class of NPs, lipid based NP are the most commonly utilized NPs in the clinic, yet their soft core structure often presents a hurdle for NP analysis. Hence, more reliable and accurate protein corona information for lipid-based NPs may enable scientists to develop safer and more efficient lipid-based nanoformulations. In particular, detailed information on the protein corona decoration at the surface of lipid-based NPs may improve our understanding of liver accumulation of these NPs [44] and could generally enable better design-based approaches to their bio-distribution, biocompatibility, and payload delivery outcomes in vivo. In another example, compositional variations in lipid-based NPs were shown to significantly change their targeting efficacies to specific organs. [45,46] The complete replacement of a conventional helper lipid with an alternative anionic or cationic lipid was shown to cause a pronounced and consistent shift of lipid NPs biodistribution in vivo from to either the mouse spleen or lung. [47] The proposed mechanism for such a striking shift in NP fate in vivo is that NPs formulated with neutral or anionic helper lipids can be uptaken by epithelial and immune cells to the spleen or lung, respectively. Robust information on the protein corona profiles of these NPs are essential to define the exact mechanism of action for these and other similar NPs. [48]",

            "text": "Conventional PEG lipids, such as distearoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (DSPE)-PEG2000, are known to remain firmly linked to LNPs and prohibit the release of the nucleic acid. Then, utilization of specific PEG lipids that possess short acyl chains (like ceramide-PEG lipids) may be advantageous to achieving high transfection efficiency because of their ability to gradually diffuse out of the LNPs, leading to the formation of destabilized LNPs that consequently release their nucleic acid contents [91,95]. \n\nThe formation of a bimolecular corona complex may change the surface properties of LNPs, and these changes can be adopted to enhance and/or target delivery of the loaded content [90,96]. It is well-documented that the type and quantity of the individual proteins employed in the formation of bimolecular corona will be determined by the intrinsic properties of nanoparticles as well as their biological activity [90]. LNPs are known to interact with blood proteins (opsonins), such as immunoglobulins (IgG and IgM), fibronectin, and a number of complement proteins. These interactions will facilitate recognition and uptake of nanoparticles by the phagocytic cells and, consequently, promote their elimination [97]. PEGylation of LNPs may diminish the recognition of nanoparticles and their rapid removal by phagocytic cells. It was reported that the inclusion of PEGylated lipids lowers the tendency of nanoparticles to adsorb complement proteins and immunoglobulins and, hence, allow nanoparticles to escape the macrophage system [94]. However, accelerated removal of PEGylated nanoparticles and stronger activation of complement interactions can be encountered upon infusion of these PEGylated nanoparticles in patients having anti-PEG antibodies [94,98].",

The characteristics of these proteins, which are one of the substantial factors in cellular response, are affected by the interactions between the nanomaterials and the biological systems. Many studies have investigated the biological behaviors of nanomaterials by conducting experiments in vitro and in vivo; however, the origin of the biological materials used is rather inconsistent. This is due to the fact that the composition of the protein coronas may differ depending on the animal origin, not on the composition or size of the nanoparticles. The resulting differences in the composition of the protein coronas can lead to different conclusions. To identify the differences in protein corona formation among sera of different species, we investigated protein coronas of gold and silica nanoparticles in serum obtained from various species. Using comparative proteomic analysis, common proteins adsorbed onto each nanoparticle among the three different sera were identified as highly abundant proteins in the serum. These findings indicate that protein corona formation is dependent on the serum population rather than the size or type of the nanoparticles. Additionally, in the physiological classification of protein coronas, human serum (HS) was found to be rich in apolipoproteins. In conclusion, our data indicate that HS components are different from those of bovine or mouse, indicating that the serum species origin should be carefully considered when selecting a biological fluid.",

The hydrodynamic diameter of corona particles was found to increase by 50 nm compared to thebare nanoparticles (Figure 4f). \n\nThe hard corona of sulphonated polystyrene (PSOSO 3 H, 100 nm, 200 nm) and SiO 2 (50 nm) nanoparticles are shown in Figure 5a-c. For bare PSOSO 3 H particles of diameter 100 nm in PBS, the monomer was consistent with the TEM image (Figure 5A) but the particle monomer peak was absent in the plasma mixture and the plasma intrinsic peak grew rapidly. The large cluster formation associated with a larger amount of protein (NP-protein complex) was confirmed in 100 nm sulfonated polystyrene, as shown in the TEM images, compared to the carboxylated NPs, where only a thin protein layer and no monomer complexes were detected (Figure 5B) [19]. The exposed charge surface of NPs in the biological milieu is a prominent feature for the determination of PC and their type of formation. The composition of PC is affected by the presence of the surface charge of NPs and their interaction with biomolecules restrains the fate of protein adsorption kinetics. To elucidate the impact of the surface charge of NPs on corona formation, Lundqvist and coworkers used polystyrene NPs withpositive (+) amine and negative (\u2212) carboxyl terminals incubated separately in human plasma and estimated the influence of the surface charge as a significant outcome [34]. The proteins susceptible to positive NPs were apolipoprotein F, mannose binding proteins, complement C1r, and the proteins susceptible to negatively charged NPs were majority of the Ig-gamma and Ig-kappa proteins. \n\nIn spite of the protein adsorption over the surface of NPs, the zeta potential remained unaltered in the range of \u221210 to \u221220 mV, indicating autonomous control over the physicochemical properties.",

Several studies have demonstrated that the surface of nanomaterials is immediately coated with suspended proteins after contact with plasma or other biological fluids to form protein corona-nanoparticle complexes. Cells react after exposure with these complexes. since, the biological fate and functions of nanomaterials are determined by physiological responses to protein -nanoparticle complexes in this article, we aimed to review some studies about the effects of the protein profiles and physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles in the biological environment on the formation of protein corona and subsequent the biological responses upon exposure to nanoparticles. Also, some used methods for of protein corona analysis has been reviewed. It has been shown that the biological impacts of protein corona may be both constructive and/or destructive in the biomedical applications of nanomaterials. The protein corona\u2013cell interactions can facilitate targeted delivery and cellular absorption of therapeutic nanomaterials and also, they mitigate the unfavorable cytotoxic effects of nanoparticles. On the other hand, these interactions may cause rapid clearance of nanoparticles from the body as well as the activation of undesirable inflammatory responses. Hence, the study of the formation mechanism and biological effects of protein corona plays an important role in the design of nanoparticles with specific physicochemical properties proportional with their intended biological activity.",

            "text": "Gold nanoparticles are surprising materials, in particular for their plasmonic properties which occur when they interact with light [1][2][3][4]. These properties are related to their nanoscale structure, depending on their shape, size, coating agent and assembly [5][6][7][8][9][10]. This implies that through an appropriate synthetic strategy, it is possible to obtain nanoparticles whose plasmonic properties adapt to the fields of application, which include, in biomedical, imaging, drug delivery, hyper-thermal and photothermal therapies [11][12][13]. While much remains to be understood about how nanoparticles interact with individual biological systems, it is generally believed that when nanoparticles come into contact with a biological medium, such as serum, the biomolecules within, mainly simple proteins and lipids, will adsorb on their surface. \n\nSerum proteins to a large extent include albumin, immunoglobulin G (IgG), fibrinogen and apolipoproteins [14][15][16][17]. The proteins that adsorb on the surface of the metal, based on their affinity with that surface, are divided into two classes: the ''hard'' corona proteins, that is tightly bound proteins, and the ''soft'' corona proteins, that is low-binding proteins. Among the various hypotheses formulated in the literature, the ''hard'' corona proteins interact directly with the metal surface, while the ''soft'' ones interact with the hard corona, and exploit the protein-protein interactions [18,19]. However, the chemical surface of the nanoparticles plays a key role in the formation of the protein corona; a stabilizing nanoparticle coating such as thiolate polyethylene glycol covalently bonded to the gold surface affects the formation of the protein corona. On the other hand, a citrate coating, which uses a negative electrostatic interaction to bind the metal surface, is easily replaceable and allows for spontaneous adsorption of proteins [20][21][22][23][24].",

The nanoparticle complexed with SA more strongly interacted with the lipid membrane than the nanoparticle alone did, implying that protein adsorption could enhance the nanoparticle-membrane binding [93]. Our group simulated the adsorption of lipids onto gold nanoparticles coated with phenylalanine (Phe), showing the formation of a lipid corona on the surface of gold nanoparticle via electrostatic interactions between charged lipid headgroups and terminal groups of phenylalanine. At low lipid concentrations, unsaturated lipids could form a complete lipid corona around a single gold-Phe nanoparticle, as observed in the experimental observation of lipid corona formation, while saturated lipids only partially coated all gold-Phe nanoparticles, causing them to aggregate [94]. Bai et al. found that the surface charge of nanoparticles significantly influenced their interactions with zwitterionic and anionic lipids, affecting how the lipid bilayer wrapped around the nanoparticle. In addition, differences in lipid composition between the corona and the bulk lipid structure were driven by the nanoparticle's lipid affinity and the intrinsic properties of the lipids themselves [95]. Li et al. found that the preadsorption of SA onto nanoparticles weakened the interactions between nanoparticles and complemented protein C3b and the nanoparticle-membrane binding (Figure 12). This supported experimental observations that SA corona on the nanoparticle surface could inhibit further protein adsorption, thereby prolonging the circulating lifetime [96].",

            "text": "The complexes formed by NPs with proteins and sugars are described as protein coronas (PCs). \n\nAs PCs travel through the body, interactions with different molecules occur and the coronas may dissolve, form conglomerates or even new compounds with unique properties. This process is known as \"from synthetic to biological identity\" and describes changes from the NPs properties designed in the laboratory to those gained by their interaction with a specific biological environment. This means that any NPs exposed to the body may form biological medium-related, unique coronas, which exert some impact on both antibacterial and toxicological activities. 7][78] Several factors play a role in the whole interaction process between NPs and protein-rich biological fluids. Lundqvist et al. 12 showed that the size of the NPs influenced this process due to the curvature effect in human blood serum. They proved this in a study where silica nanoparticles of the same type but of various sizes differently influenced the binding of A-lipoprotein from human blood. The smaller the NPs, the greater the number of proteins that bound as PCs. Also, they showed that the bigger the NP size, the more up-regulated the thrombin-generation assay. The authors, therefore, showed that the same NPs, but of various sizes, may affect the organism response in different ways. Also, Ajdar et al. 76 showed that gold nanoparticles added to human blood generated a faster prothrombotic response (in a nonlinear size dependent manner). They also showed the concentration dependent manner of the prothrombogenic effects and reduction of time until initial clot formation. Moreover, they noticed that clot strength decreased significantly in line with the size of the NPs added. 76 he aforementioned studies confirmed the extreme diversification of the interactions between NPs and biological fluids. Few studies have yet evaluated PC formation in the oral cavity, or sufficiently explained their impact on the oral mucosa and its permeability. 3",

            "text": "In conclusion, the present, comprehensive study has provided an illustration of the interplay between the synthetic and biological 'identities' of nanoparticles [8] and serves to underscore that the so-called corona of plasma proteins may influence both the magnetic and biological behavior of SPIONs, but also provides evidence that this is nanoparticle-dependent insofar as the corona was shown to promote cellular uptake of silica-coated, but not dextran-coated nanoparticles. Obviously, plasma proteins cannot be avoided when nanoparticles are administered intravenously in patients, and the grafting of PEG or other polymers onto nanoparticle surfaces may reduce, but will not completely prevent protein corona formation [35]. Therefore, the adsorption of proteins and other biomolecules needs to be taken into account in the design of any nanoparticle for clinical use, and the formation of a (specific) corona could also be exploited to confer novel advantageous properties to nanoparticles [11]. The present proteomics study has provided an inventory of human plasma proteins with affinity for silica-and dextran-coated SPIONs that may prove useful in further optimization of SPIONs for medical imaging.",

            "text": "Polymer-Coated NP with Protein Corona. Knowledge of the protein corona formed after contact with NPs plays a critical role in determining the zeta potential and, consequently, in characterizing the nature of NPs, including clearance of the mesosystem, biological fate, opsonization, or uptake of NPs 22 (Figure 1). Experimental studies confirm 1b,c,12,23 that these dynamic processes associated with corona formation can influence zeta potential (\u03b6), cellular uptake, and NP fate of NPs in the body, determining cellular responses, such as cytotoxicity. 23 For example, Vroman and Lukosevicius 1d demonstrated in the 1960s that the interaction of NPs with any biological medium leads to the formation of a protein corona. The arrangement of proteins that attach to the nanovectors depends on many factors, including (i) the properties of the NPs (including material type, size, and surface charge) and (ii) the composition of the biological substrate. Consequently, the protein coating imparts a biological identity to the NPs, determining their stability, biological distribution, interactions, and toxicity. This identity can be determined by the zeta potential (\u03b6) and the pH of the biological medium. 24 On the basis of the PNP characteristics, the composition of the biological medium in the developed nano-QSPR model (eq 1) is expressed by the core descriptors (AMW-P), the coating (nCsp2\u2212C), and corona (CC1rs, AA-I, kininogen-1) (Table 1). The results of the developed model (eq 1) clearly show that modelers should go beyond \"average\" and \"standard\" nanostructure descriptors when developing true models to provide key properties of true NPs (i.e., descriptors describing their temporal heterogeneity in the environment). One of the most common factors that determine NP heterogeneity over time (e.g., NP uptake into the cell and between cellular compartments in the biological system) is the formation of a protein corona.",

            "text": "The potential applications of nanomaterials as drug delivery systems and in other products continue to expand. Upon introduction into physiological environments and driven by energetics, nanomaterials readily associate proteins forming a protein corona (PC) on their surface. This PC influences the nanomaterial\u2019s surface characteristics and may impact their interaction with cells. To determine the biological impact of nanomaterial exposure as well as nanotherapeutic applications, it is necessary to understand PC formation. Utilizing a label-free mass spectrometry-based proteomics approach, we examined the composition of the PC for a set of four silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) including citrate-stabilized and polyvinlypyrrolidone-stabilized (PVP) colloidal silver (20 or 110 nm diameter). To simulate cell culture conditions, AgNPs were incubated for 1 h in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, washed, coronal proteins solubilized, and proteins identified and quantified by label-free LC-MS/MS. To determine which attributes influence PC formation, the AgNPs were characterized in both water and cell culture media with 10% FBS. All AgNPs associated a common subset of 11 proteins including albumin, apolipoproteins, keratins, and other serum proteins. 110 nm citrate- and PVP-stabilized AgNPs were found to bind the greatest number of proteins (79 and 85 respectively) compared to 20 nm citrate- and PVP-stabilized AgNPs (45 and 48 respectively), suggesting a difference in PC formation based on surface curvature. While no relationships were found for other protein parameters (isoelectric point or aliphatic index), the PC on 20 nm AgNPs (PVP and citrate) consisted of more hydrophobic proteins compared to 110 nm AgNPs implying that this class of proteins are more receptive to curvature-induced folding and crowding in exchange for an increased hydration in the aqueous environment. These observations demonstrate the significance of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions in the formation of the PC which may have broad biological and toxicological implications.",

            "text": "Nanomaterials adopt a new \"identity\" in the body through the adsorption of proteins and other biomolecules (Nel et al., 2009). This phenomenon, known as bio-corona formation, is dependent upon intrinsic properties of the nanomaterials including size or surface curvature and surface chemistry (Cedervall et al., 2007;Lundqvist et al., 2008;Tenzer et al., 2011) and on the physiological environment (i.e., the extracellular or intracellular milieu). Thus, the biological identity of nanomaterials is context dependent (Nystr\u00f6m & Fadeel, 2012). Importantly, while most publications are focused on the protein corona, one should not ignore other biomolecules including lipids, as lipid-binding proteins are commonly found in the bio-corona of nanoparticles (Hellstrand et al., 2009). \n\nThe environmental dimensions of the protein corona (often referred to as the \"eco-corona\") have been expertly covered (Wheeler et al., 2021) and will not be discussed here. \n\nIn our previous survey of bio-corona research, it was noted that we and others had deployed proteomics approaches to catalogue the proteins present on the surface of a wide range of nanomaterials including spherical particles such as superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) or polystyrene (PS) particles and fiber-like materials including single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) (Fadeel et al., 2013). The majority of these studies were carried out using human plasma or fetal bovine serum (FBS), and in many cases, several hundred proteins were identified in the biocorona (Tenzer et al., 2013). However, these results prompt several questions: first, why do so many different proteins congregate on the surface of nanoparticles? Indeed, as previously pointed out, it seems counterintuitive that \"proteins in the blood that evolved not to bind nonspecifically to each other would do so around nanoparticles\" (Lundqvist & Cedervall, 2020).",

Apart from the ability to harness protein corona and tumor targeting, the bio-inspired pre-coating could also increase the stability of this NP system under the lysosomal acid environment and reduce its cytotoxicity. The anti-cancer cell proliferation and anti-tumor proliferation effects were studied in vitro and in vivo, proving that precoating the functional biomimetic albumin is an excellent and promising strategy for better drug delivery efficiency and therapeutic effects. Han Yang et al. showed another bio-inspired NP system pre-coated with cyclic RGDyK peptide (cRGD) modified bovine serum albumin (BSA) for impeding the formation of the protein corona, enhancing targeting ability to tumor cells, increasing delivery efficiency of nucleic acid drugs and improving therapeutic effects [79]. By preventing the protein corona formation, the pre-coating in this system played a dual role: enhancing the targeting ability of cancer cells and reducing serum protein adsorption for a prolonged circulation time (Figure 8B). Apart from the ability to harness protein corona Other endogenous proteins are used for harnessing protein corona, for example, the ApoE protein. The role of ApoE in protein corona has been explored in the recent clinical approved lipid nanoparticle-based short interfering RNA drug Onpattro, and there are also other studies focusing on the role of ApoE coating. In the study of Xiang Lu et al., assisted by the combination of experimental and computational methods, they found that ApoE pre-coating on NP systems will change their pharmacokinetic characteristics and prolong the circulation time without increasing cytotoxicity, which could be mainly attributed to their influence on the formation and composition of protein corona [80].",

            "text": "When nanoparticles enter biological media, the number of proteins they may get in contact with is in the thousands. However, they cannot all fit onto the nanoparticle surface: typically, less than 100 proteins form the hard corona in nanoparticles of >10 nm [34,35], resulting in the possibility of subpopulations of a certain nanoparticle with different protein coronas, potentially showing different in vivo behavior [11]. The impact of the environment in the protein corona composition is not limited to the upfront formation of the corona, but when the NPPC changes its location, the composition of the corona is affected by the new environment, leading to changes in the identity and quantity of the proteins that formed the hard corona. Protein composition variation is even more pronounced in the soft corona, as they have lower and more variable resident times. Therefore, characterization and understanding the size and composition of the protein corona is critical to predicting the behavior of the NPPC in biological systems, and to design nanoparticles with specific properties, such as improved biocompatibility or targeted drug delivery. In this regard, the identification of both major and minor proteins that form the corona is essential, as is the study of their abundance and their affinity, e.g., to study their competition to bind when the system is under kinetic or thermodynamic influence, or understanding the NPPC fate in biological systems or role in biomedicine [8,18]. \n\nIt should be stressed that identification of the different proteins is not enough to obtain a comprehensive characterization of the protein corona. The dynamism in the protein corona composition (particularly the soft corona), as well as the reasonable assumption that the most abundant proteins will define the biological roles of the NPPC, demands quantitative data in order to achieve a comprehensive characterization. Additionally, considering that protein corona composition is driven by the affinity and interactions between nanoparticle and proteins, there is not necessarily a correlation in protein abundance in the media and in the corona [17,18]. Because of these challenges that entail the study of NPPCs in biological systems, unbound proteins present in the media must be removed prior to the proteomic study of the corona, without affecting or altering the NPPC composition.",

Nanoparticles will rapidly adsorb proteins forming what is known as the protein \"corona\" after enters the circulation system. The structure and composition of the protein corona depends on the synthetic identity of the nanomaterial, this would in uence the biological identity of nanoparticles [28] . The physiological functions of various proteins that comprise the protein corona generally involve lipid transport, coagulation, complement activation, pathogen recognition, or ion transport [29] . Understanding nanoparticle-protein interactions is a crucial issue in the development of targeted nanomaterial delivery in vivo [30] . The physiological environment to which nanoparticles are rst exposed after intravenous administration is the blood stream, and the cell-free portion of the blood (plasma) contains more than 1000 proteins. These proteins potentially interact with nanoparticles to exert different physiological functions, such as recognition by macrophages, causing in ammatory reactions, thrombosis and allergic reactions [31] . \n\nThe safety issues of biomaterials with exceptional biocompatibility and hemo-compatibility have also received extensive attention at the nanoscale. Numerous nanomaterials have been widely used as drug delivery systems and diagnostic contrast agents in treating cardiovascular diseases.

In the same cell model but using a different cationic lipid to formulate the LNP, Sahay et al. reported that downregulation of Cdc42 and Rac1 led to 80% decrease in LNP uptake, whereas inhibition of clathrin heavy chain-1 and caveolin-1 had little impact on LNP entry. 205 Together, these studies highlight areas in the design of LNP, which need further optimization and understanding to achieve efficient intracellular delivery.\n\nSince LNP delivery efficiency is influenced by the formation of a protein corona in biological media, one may expect that a healthy individual or a patient suffering of a pathology affecting the serum composition, will have different serum-protein diversity and concentration which could possibly affect the protein-corona composition of LNP and thus alter their activity in vivo, as observed for PLGA nanoparticles. 206 In addition, it is important to note that lipid self-assembly and therefore LNP morphology is driven by biophysical parameters including composition, temperature, pressure, electrostatics and lipid packing which have already been extensively reviewed and are therefore not addressed here. 207\u2212209 Therefore, the morphology and functional response of an RNA-LNP system administrated into a patient with abnormal body temperature (e.g., fever or low-body-temperature-related syndrome) may differ (e.g., protein-corona formation and delivery efficiency) when compared to a healthy volunteer. To date, LNPs have shown efficient delivery of RNA to the liver using passive cellular targeting (size control and protein adsorption). Compositional variations in LNPs have been demonstrated to enhance LNP accumulation in the lung and spleen; 210 however, delivery to other organs remains challenging. Like liposomal systems, LNPs can take advantage of \"natural\" and synthetic targeting processes to actively reach specific tissues and cells. The main strategies rely on proteins, peptides or natural ligands, antibodies or antibody fragments, as well as aptamers. Antibody-mediated targeting has demonstrated success in gene-silencing with LNP systems. As an example, Rameshetti et al. used an anti-CD4",

The interaction of nanoparticle formulations with cells and proteins in blood has long been discussed [39e41]. Recently, proteins bound to LNPs, called protein corona or biomolecular corona because of their shape, have been the subject of much research attention as factors that contribute greatly to LNP pharmacokinetics [42e45]. The latest findings concerning protein coronas of LNPs, including the analytical technical aspects, were recently reviewed [46]. Although there are still many unknowns owing to the immaturity of the technology, a list of constituents of protein coronas has been developed, that includes serum albumin, complement factors, immunoglobulins, and apolipoproteins. Proteins present in smaller quantities may be important; improving the methods of separation of LNP-protein corona complexes and the sophistication of proteomics technology are key to a more detailed analysis of the protein coronas. The physiological and pathological conditions of patients and animal models, and the route of administration, and their impact on pharmacokinetics are also important factors to consider.\n\nFor a detailed analysis of the intratissue distribution of LNPs, a method that makes use of the Cre/loxP recombinase system is beginning to be used [47e49]. This method uses transgenic mice that have reporter genes (especially fluorescent proteins) downstream of the loxP-flanked stop cassette, which blocks reporter gene expression in the absence of cyclization recombinase (Cre) in the cells, but in the presence of Cre, the stop cassette is removed, and the gene is expressed (Fig. 2) [50]. For example, the typical Ai14 mouse has Lox-Stop-Lox-tdTomato (LSL-tdTomato) inserted into the Rosa26 region, which is a known safe harbor locus for gene insertion into the mouse genome [50]. These",

            "text": "Nanoparticle drug delivery systems have shown promise in delivering therapeutics effectively within natural environments, including the complex milieu of the human body. In this natural environment, NPs encounter various physiological challenges, such as interactions with blood components, immune responses, and tissue-specific barriers. Their interactions with biomolecules are significantly influencing NP-based applications because they can change their biological identity. \n\nDue to their high surface free energy, nanostructures interact with proteins upon introduction into biological fluids (BFs). These interactions, including electrostatic, Van der Waals, hydrophobic, and hydrogen bonding, drive the adsorption of proteins onto the surface of NPs in the biological environment [52]. These protein layers were defined as the \"protein corona (PC)\" [53]. The PC can be categorized into different layers, encompassing the 'soft' and 'hard' corona, based on the binding affinity between the proteins and the NPs' surface [54]. The formation of PCs in biological fluids is a very dynamic process. Proteins with low affinity and reversible binding, such as serum albumin [55], may be replaced by proteins with low abundance but high affinity, such as immunoglobulins [56], apolipoprotein ApoA [57], and complement factors [58]. The phenomenon known as the \"Vroman effect\" involves a time-and concentration-dependent exchange to achieve dynamic equilibrium. The NP-protein complex eventually achieves a stable and irreversible minimum energy state as time progresses [55,59,60]. \n\nThroughout the adsorption process, proteins have the potential to experience conformational changes as they adjust to the surface of the nano-biosystem. This event possesses the capacity to induce modifications in the secondary/tertiary structures of proteins and their interactions with the surrounding media. The biological functions of proteins in BFs rely on their interactions with various biomolecules and substances. Therefore, even minor alterations in protein structure resulting from interactions with NPs can greatly affect their pharmacological activities and interactions with other proteins, resulting in varied biological responses [59]. \n\nThe existence of a responsive PC can significantly influence the uptake of NPs by cells and the activation of intracellular pathways [61].",

            "text": "Protein corona formation is an intrinsic property of nanoparticles that are exposed to biological environments and is often modulated by a nanoparticle's physicochemical properties [160][161][162][163]. Corona composition is dynamic, and protein mobility plays an important role in the desorption/adsorption process. The Vroman effect addresses protein corona formation in materials exposed to a physiological environment and postulates that protein exchange will change corona composition, while the overall quantity of proteins remains roughly the same [163,164]. As reported for many cellular types, the uptake levels and mechanisms of internalization of nanoparticles are affected by the composition of this protein corona [165][166][167][168]. Particle biodistribution and clearance are also significantly influenced by the protein corona. Proteins such as serum albumin, apolipoproteins, fibrinogen, clusterin, and Ig gamma and light chains are commonly found in the protein corona interaction with membrane and fusion pore formation followed by detachment from the membrane for sufficiently low ligand densities. Nanoparticles are considered rigid spheres and ligands are considered pH independent. The last condition guarantees that the number of bonds and receptors that is at the end of endocytosis is the same as the number that is at the beginning of exocytosis.

            "text": "Despite their potential, the adoption of nanotechnology in therapeutics remains limited, with only around eighty nanomedicines approved in the past 30 years. This disparity is partly due to the \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d approach in medical design, which often overlooks patient-specific variables such as biological sex, genetic ancestry, disease state, environment, and age that influence nanoparticle behavior. Nanoparticles (NPs) must be transported through systemic, microenvironmental, and cellular barriers that vary across heterogeneous patient populations. Key patient-dependent properties impacting NP delivery include blood flow rates, body fat distribution, reproductive organ vascularization, hormone and protein levels, immune responses, and chromosomal differences. Understanding these variables is crucial for developing effective, patient-specific nanotechnologies. The formation of a protein corona around NPs upon exposure to biological fluids significantly alters NP properties, affecting biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, cytotoxicity, and organ targeting. The dynamics of the protein corona, such as time-dependent composition and formation of soft and hard coronas, depend on NP characteristics and patient-specific serum components. This review highlights the importance of understanding protein corona formation across different patient backgrounds and its implications for NP design, including sex, ancestry, age, environment, and disease state. By exploring these variables, we aim to advance the development of personalized nanomedicine, improving therapeutic efficacy and patient outcomes. Graphical Abstract",

            "text": "The rapid development of nanotechnology provides new approaches to manufacturing food-related nanoparticles in various food industries, including food formulation, functional foods, food packaging, and food quality control. Once ingested, nanoparticles will immediately adsorb proteins in the biological fluids, forming a corona around them. Protein coronas alter the properties of nanoparticles, including their toxicity, cellular uptake, and targeting characteristics, by altering the aggregation state. In addition, the conformation and function of proteins and enzymes are also influenced by the formation of protein coronas, affecting the digestion of food products. Since the inevitable application of nanoparticles in food industries and their subsequent digestion, a comprehensive understanding of protein coronas is essential. This systematic review introduces nanoparticles in food and explains the formation of protein coronas, with interactions between proteins and nanoparticles. Furthermore, the potential origin of nanoparticles in food that migrate from packaging materials and their fates in the gastrointestinal tract has been reviewed. Finally, this review explores the possible effects of protein coronas on bioactive compounds, including probiotics and prebiotics. Understanding the formation mechanisms of protein coronas is crucial, as it enables the design of tailored delivery systems to optimize the bioavailability of bioactive compounds.",

[66] Blood is thicker than water -the impact of corona formation on blood system physiology As the perturbation of physiological systems by nanoparticles has recently been reviewed, 27,67,68 we here focus on novel insights into the role of the protein corona for the blood system. \n\nWhen designed for nanomedical applications, such as drug delivery or imaging, nanoparticle administration often requires intravenous injections. 2,69 Hence, detailed knowledge about the physical and chemical aspects associated with the behaviour of NPs in the complex protein-rich environment of the blood system is thus key for (re)shaping the future of nanobiomedicine. As the complete plasma proteome reference set contains more than two thousand different proteins, 70 such knowledge is particularly relevant for plasma proteins. 4,6,26,28,71 Indeed, the plasma protein corona has recently been shown to be indeed highly complex as well. 6 roteins involved in physiological as well as toxicological relevant processes in the blood system, such as to complement activation and coagulation, have been identified in the coronas of various NPs. 4,6,26,28,44,71,72 The identified proteins span about three to four orders of magnitude dynamic range, most likely covering most biologically relevant corona proteins. 6 Notably, the respective abundance of all of these proteins was affected by The early phase: a highly complex corona is established already in 30 sec, which may be composed of multiple coreshell structures ('new'). A corona of low complexity evolves slowly ('old'). (B) The late phase: corona composition ex situ remains stable and changes predominantly quantitatively rather than qualitatively over time with Vromaneffect dependent and independent binding kinetics ('new').",

Reliable characterization of the protein corona is, therefore, a vital step in the development of safe and efficient diagnostic and therapeutic nanomedicine products. 2134 published manuscripts on the protein corona are reviewed and a down-selection of 470 papers spanning 2000\u20132021, comprising 1702 nanoparticle (NP) systems is analyzed. This analysis reveals: i) most corona studies have been conducted on metal and metal oxide nanoparticles; ii) despite their overwhelming presence in clinical practice, lipid-based NPs are underrepresented in protein corona research, iii) studies use new methods to improve reliability and reproducibility in protein corona research; iv) studies use more specific protein sources toward personalized medicine; and v) careful characterization of nanoparticles after corona formation is imperative to minimize the role of aggregation and protein contamination on corona outcomes. As nanoparticles used in biomedicine become increasingly prevalent and biochemically complex, the field of protein corona research will need to focus on developing analytical approaches and characterization techniques appropriate for each unique nanoparticle formulation. Achieving such characterization of the nano-bio interface of nanobiotechnologies will enable more seamless development and safe implementation of nanoparticles in medicine.",

            "text": "With high surface energy, nanoparticles (NPs) incubated in biological fluids are quickly covered by surrounding biomolecules, mainly proteins, to form a new entity called the 'biomolecular corona' [1][2][3]. As the corona bestows NPs with a new biological identity, controlling the formation of the corona could provide a new strategy for nano-therapeutics, as well as for biomarker discovery [4][5][6][7]. Differences in the number of proteins and their relative concentrations between different coronas are undoubtedly linked to the physicochemical properties of NPs and the composition of biological fluids [8]. Considering the latter, it has been reported that the human plasma concentration in the incubation step affects the corona protein compositions of NPs with different surface chemistry, including commonly used nanomaterials silica and polystyrene NPs (3-80% plasma, v/v) [9,10], cationic liposomes (2.5-80% plasma) [11], gold NPs (10-80% plasma) [12] and graphene-based systems (0.1-100% plasma) [13,14]. The discrepancy in the corona protein compositions between different studies using similar NP types and plasma concentrations, however, indicates that other factors control the corona formation. \n\nNP stability refers to the preservation of a particular nanostructure property, including crystallinity, composition, size and shape [15]. In biological media, NP aggregation that forms large and irregularly shaped clusters is one of the most common issues related to NP stability [16]. As NP aggregates are usually irregular with an arbitrary random shape and a disordered structure, the aggregation has a negative impact on both in vitro and in vivo studies. For example, it could lead to misrepresentative and irreproducible results in the cellular uptake, and could influence the biodistribution, pharmacokinetics and toxicity of NPs in an undesirable manner [16][17][18]. \n\nCholesterol is an important component of human plasma that plays a critical role in different biological processes [19].",

            "text": "Nanostructures exposed to a biological environment (e.g., the bloodstream after systemic injection) can be rapidly covered by a large variety of biological molecules, particularly proteins. These molecules, associated with the nanostructure surface, form the so-called \"protein corona\" (PC). 1 PC represents a phenomenon of pivotal importance for understanding and predicting the interaction between nanostructures and living organisms. The PC is usually the first element of a nanostructure to be in contact with biological entities and cells, determining the \"biological identity\" of the nanostructures themselves. PC can hinder nanostructure properties and alter their performances: it has been shown that the presence of PC can reduce the stability in solution, cause aggregation, increase the nanostructure toxicity, reduce the efficiency of functional molecules associated with the surface of the particles, and lead to an undesired interaction with the biological environment, like an excessive stimulation of the immune \u2020 Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: Five supplementary figures depicting the BBB characterization, the time-dependent evolution of PC associated with LMNVs analyzed by confocal microscopy, and the co-localization analysis between LMNVs and, respectively, lysosomes, clathrin-positive vesicles, and caveolin-positive vesicles. Seven supplementary tables reporting the lists of proteins present in LMNV-PC after the BBB passage, of proteins present in LMNV-PC exposed just to FBS without the passage through the BBB, of proteins conserved before and after the BBB passage, of proteins associated with LMNVs exposed to the secretome of bEnd.3 cells, of proteins associated both with LMNVs that crossed the BBB and with LMNVs that were exposed to the bEnd.3 secretome, of proteins associated both with LMNVs exposed to only FBS and LMNVs exposed to the bEnd.3 secretome, and finally of proteins present under all experimental conditions.

            "text": "Nanoparticles have been studied for drug delivery and antitumor therapeutics [1][2][3][4][5]. Experimental and theoretical studies have mostly focused on modulating the size, structure, and surface properties of nanoparticles, in order to increase the targeting efficiency of nanoparticles [6][7][8][9][10]. However, when nanoparticles flow through the bloodstream, they interact with various plasma proteins and, thus, their surfaces are often covered by multiple protein layers, a process called protein corona [11,12]. The formation of protein corona influences conformations and surface properties of nanoparticles, which can significantly increase or decrease the targeting efficiency and cytotoxicity via electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions between nanoparticles and cell membranes [11, [13][14][15][16][17][18]. The mechanism of protein corona formation and the effect of protein corona on nanoparticle properties and interactions with cell membranes need to be studied at nearly the atomic scale in order to understand this and complement relevant experiments, as can be done using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Because the system containing multiple plasma proteins and nanoparticles is too large to simulate using all-atom models, theoretical studies, such as kinetic mean-field theory (MFT), density functional theory (DFT), and monte carlo (MC) simulations have been mainly performed until 2000s, but advances on computer power and force-field development make it possible to perform MD simulations of the nanoparticle complexed with plasma proteins for the past decade. Figure 1 shows that citations for research papers regarding MD simulations under the topic of protein corona have drastically increased, which will be thoroughly reviewed here, with a focus on plasma proteins, but not on other molecules, such as peptides and synthetic polymers. Zhdanov's review paper is highly recommended for MFT, DFT, and MC simulations of protein corona on nanoparticles [19]. In this review, we aim to show that MD simulations can successfully predict the experimentally observed compositions and structures of protein corona and their interactions with lipid membranes, as.",

A spectrum of technologies enables nanoparticles to be manufactured and engineered with a specific synthetic (material-intrinsic) identity including rational coating of their surface to facilitate specific applications including tissue targeting in biomedical applications [10][11][12][13] (see Table 1, column 2). For example, nanoparticles that have been covalently linked to macromolecules such as polyethylene glycol, antibodies, or peptides are designed to ensure desirable levels of solubility, stability, or biological activity in drug delivery (Table 1, columns 1-3).  One of the major aims in manipulating the surface properties of nanoparticles is to control their targeting and pharmacokinetics properties which are necessary for efficacious drug delivery [24,25]. When exposed to a physiological environment, such as the blood, nanoparticles interact with components of their environment. It is known that proteins in the blood convert naked nanoparticles into nanoparticles with a surface protein coat called a \"protein corona\" [26][27][28][29] (see Figure 1). The formation of a protein corona on nanoparticles is mediated by mutual electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonding, van der Waals forces, or \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking. The protein corona confers a new physical, chemical, and biological identity to the nanoparticles [28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36]. bonding, van der Waals forces, or \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking.

            "text": "In another study (Meyer et al., 2022), LNPs containing a positively charged group of the additional lipid and a PLGA polymer also got distributed into lungs and the spleen, and the distribution was influenced by the ratio of a cationic lipid (DOTAP) to an ionizable lipid (MC3). Of note, switching the method of mRNA introduction from encapsulation to adsorption made it possible to achieve up to 80% expression of a target protein in the lungs when composition with a DOTAP/MC3 ratio of 1:1 was employed, and up to 50% expression in the spleen with composition featuring a DOTAP/MC3 ratio of 3:1. Nanoparticles carrying adsorbed mRNA had a size of ~200 nm and did not accumulate in kidneys during excretion, likely indicating the suitability of such particles for subsequent pharmaceutical research and development. In addition, these nanoparticles did not contain cholesterol, and Cy5-labeled mRNA was detectable but not expressed in the liver; this finding may be predictive of the behavior of other cholesterolfree particles. These data are consistent with another study (Gueguen et al., 2024), where LNPs of five-component composition containing cationic lipid IM21.7c also got distributed into lungs and the spleen (and very little into the liver), and >95% of the reporter protein was expressed in the lungs when the LNPs were administered intravenously. The zetapotential of the LNPs containing cationic lipid IM21.7c was positive, in contrast to the previously obtained nanoparticles (Dilliard et al., 2021), which also got distributed into lungs and the spleen but had negative zeta-potential. We believe that zeta-potential has insufficient predictive value to determine a target organ. \n\nThus, the addition of a charged lipid into LNPs affects pK a of the particles, which in turn determines the formation of a protein corona on the surface of the LNPs and accordingly their subsequent distribution throughout organs, which is modulated by proteins of the corona.",

Saha et al. showed the correlation between macrophage uptake and class of corona proteins.

Herein, lipoproteins had higher abundance in protein corona composition of the PECs in compare with FBS. \n\ncellular in vitro study. Effects of serum and pH on uptake of nanoparticles. To find the correlation between structural parameters, medium condition, protein corona, and cellular uptake of PECs, this set of PECs was selected for in vitro tests to simultaneously evaluate effects of D/Ch ratio, thiolation of dextran, Ch Mw, PEC size, and their zeta potential on cellular uptake of the PECs. Furthermore, effects of FBS and pH of the medium on uptake of the PECs were studied. As shown in Fig. 4A, we found out that uptake of the PECs was noticeably enhanced by FBS (p < 0.05). However, it was not significant for the thiolated PEC composed of Ch18 with D/Ch ratio of 0.2 in acidic medium, and Ch-DNA complex in the medium with pH, 7.4. Previous researches indicated that serum proteins influence uptake of nanoparticles by cells as the structurally same nanoparticles can lead to very different biological outcomes in the presence or absence of protein corona 55 . Herein, different parameters have reverse effects on the test results. First, FBS lead to an increase in uptake of the PECs because cell function rises by addition of serum. Second, interaction of nanoparticles with serum proteins leads to an increase in size of the nanoparticles and changes their surface properties such as zeta potential, consequently, it decreases PEC uptake. Third, existence of some proteins in corona such as inter alpha-trypsin inhibitor chains and lipoproteins could enhance the cellular uptake 56,57 .",

            "text": "The corona detected for the 76 nm sample in the whole blood samples resembled apolipoprotein A-I with aprominent band, rather than the 9.5 nm sample. In serum, the detected corona was in a changeover from 9.5 to the 76 nm NPs i.e., the quantity of apolipoprotein A-I reduced with the increase in NP size due to the change in size or curvature of the NPs [33]. Besides the particle size, the PC detected around the NPs also depended upon parameters such as the composition of the biological medium, and the fraction of the particle surface area in direct contact with the biological medium. \n\nIf the surface area of the NPs is large i.e., if a large number of particles are present in a given area, a low affinity protein may bind and stabilize the interaction with the aggregates of NPs. The exposed surface area may also reflect the protein-compelled NP aggregation. The trapped protein in the complex can be analyzed after its release from the NP-protein corona complex although it is not a part of corona composition. The large surface area aggregates of the corona with diversified proteins have been explained in previous work [34,35]. \n\nWalczyk et al. conducted a study on several normal nanoparticles dispersed in blood plasma to investigate the formation and categorization of (hard or soft) PC assembly and their longevity. Herein, the authors used carboxylated polystyrene particles (PSCOOH), sulfonated polystyrene particles of sizes 100 and 200 nm, and silica particles of size 50 nm incubated in normal plasma. The results are shown in Figure 4a-f. In Figure 4a, it can be seenall the changes in the peaks during incubation were reproducible. Figure 4b shows that the protein complex monomer and the bigger protein-particle complexes were retained with unaltered sizes as in the plasma in situ. Figure 4c,d indicates that the particles werepolydisperse in nature, and that protein conformation is affected by the method of sample preparation. Moreover, the size of corona particle was observed to be 5 nm larger than the bare nanoparticle (Figure 4e).",

            "text": "It can be divided into two categories: a \"hard\" corona, and a \"soft\" corona. The \"soft\" corona is based on abundant proteins that firstly bind to the nanoparticle through low-affinity bonds, and the \"hard\" corona is more dense [17], based on sparse proteins that replace the \"soft\" proteins over time, due to their higher affinity bonds [11], which is known as the Vroman effect [18]. The composition of the corona is directly dependent on the biomolecular composition of the physiological environment that surrounds it [19,20], the time of exposure [11,17,21], and also incubation conditions (such as temperature or mild stirring), among others. Moreover, it is clear that the protein corona is not static and varies in the course of time; in other words, it's dynamic [17,21]. Eventually, it will reach a state of equilibrium, steady stochastic state, where the association and dissociation rates for each protein occur equally [21], unless it is further incubated in a different biological media or proximal biological fluid, with a formation of a new corona [22]. The great majority of the proteins that form the corona are independent of the size and surface charge of the nanoparticle but are very influenced by the chemical properties of the material that constitutes the nanoparticle [23]. However, there are still sensitive proteins to size and surface charge, whose nature can change and consequently alter the interactions between nanoparticles and cells with the consequent alteration of the biological outcome and biological impacts [23]. For instance, if opsonins bind to the nanoparticle in the protein corona, they will be recognized as a \"threat,\" and consequently are phagocytosed by macrophages [24]. It is crucial to prevent opsonization, \"camouflage\" the nanoparticle to avoid the phagocytosis, and keep the nanoparticles in circulation, which can be achieved by the application of a polymer coating, such as poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) [25].",

            "text": "This functionalization eventually affects the formation of the protein corona (because it largely confers a stealth character on the nanoparticle, protecting it and making it inaccessible to proteins) and could be crucial when developing nanoparticles with biological or therapeutical applications [28]. Walkey et al. observed that differently charged ligands have more adsorption capabilities than neutral ligands [17], whereas Galmarini et al. observed a higher number of proteins forming the corona when nanoparticles were initially functionalized with citrates rather than with DMSA, stating the influence of the nanoparticle functionalization on the corona protein composition [25]. Despite the clear relevance of the adequate characterization of nanoparticle functionalization, there are yet no standard methods available to determine nanoparticle/surface biomolecule ratios [29]. The surface charge of nanoparticles also seems to be a key parameter affecting nanoparticle-protein interactions. Indeed, Lundquist et al. studied the PC composition formed in three different polystyrene particles: with positive (amine-modified), neutral (the plain unmodified particles), or negative (carboxylmodified) charges. Remarkably, they found a certain dependence of the resultant protein corona depending on surface charge and zeta potential, and they were able to identify adsorption patterns and similarities [30]. \n\nInterestingly, several works have found that nanoparticle size seems to be more relevant than their functionalization in the formation of the protein corona. Tenzer et al., for instance, determined nanoparticle size to be dominant in the formation of the protein corona over surface functionalization, which in turn was dominant over exposure time [14]. When comparing nanoparticles of different sizes with the same functionalization, Walkey et al. observed that the steric hindrances formed in larger nanoparticles hindered the adsorption of proteins, which was more favored in smaller ones [17]. Nanoparticle shape is a key parameter that has, for some reasons, been disregarded in protein corona investigations. However, different studies evidenced that protein corona formation is also dependent on nanoparticle morphology.",

For the purpose of this chapter, we intend to consider the biological corona as the layer of organic molecules, typically proteins, derived from biological systems that bind to nanoparticle surfaces when nanoparticles are exposed to a biological environment. The protein corona has profound implications on cellular uptake and toxicity of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), though a deeper understanding of the properties that govern corona formation would provide a greater opportunity for scientists to create tailored AuNPs for specific applications. Specifically, the information provided in this chapter predominantly deals with AuNPs; however these principles are likely to be extended to other nanomaterials.",

            "text": "The formation of protein coronas around engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) in biological environments is critical in nanomedicine, as these coronas significantly influence the biological behavior of ENPs. Despite extensive research on protein coronas, understanding the in situ influence of whole (soft plus hard) protein coronas has remained challenging. In this study, we demonstrate a strategy to assess the in situ effects of whole coronas on the model biosensing of anti-IgG using IgG-conjugated gold nanoparticles (IgG-AuNPs) through fluorescence nanoparticle tracking analysis (F-NTA), which enables the selective tracking of fluorescent particles within complex media. In our approach, anti-IgG and IgG-AuNPs were labeled with distinct fluorescent dyes. The accordance in hydrodynamic diameter distributions observed at two different wavelengths verifies the successful capture of anti-IgG on the IgG-AuNPs. The counting of fluorescent anti-IgG within the size distribution allows for a quantitative assessment of biosensing efficiency. This method was applied to evaluate the effects of four protein coronas\u2014human serum albumin, high-density lipoproteins, immunoglobulin G, and fibrinogen\u2014as well as their mixture across varying incubation times and concentrations. The results suggest that the physical presence of whole protein coronas surrounding the IgG-AuNPs may assist the biosensing interaction in situ rather than screening it.",

Similar results have been obtained with other drugs aimed at brain tissue, such as methoxorubicin, using polysorbate 80-coated polybutylcyanoacrylate (PBCA) nanoparticles coated with polysorbate-80 and ApoE [43]. \n\nThe composition of the protein corona is very complex, variable and very dependent on the initial biological environment that comes in contact with the nanoparticles, which indicates the possibility of the existence of memory on exposure. Certain components of the so-called protein corona such as Opsonins (IgG,complement and many others) may accelerate the RES uptake of coated nanoparticles [44,45]. On the other hand, there are so-called proteins dysopsonins, such as albumin, which, if coated with particles, prevent the activation of the complement, thus prolonging the circulation time and reducing toxicity [46,47]. The rate of adsorbtion and desorption for each protein determines the retention time in the corona and the way it interacts with the nanoparticle surface. Prolonged or irreversible protein binding in nanoparticle leads to the formation of a \"solid corona\". Behind the solid corona lies the soft corona, which is a layer of proteins that have a high rate of adsorbtion/ desorption due to which their binding to the corona is reversible. Thus, the composition of the protein corona is dynamic and the proteins with high plasma concentrations and adsorbtion constants will be in the initial maturation of the corona. \n\nThis competitive process of protein adsorbtion, which depends on protein concentration, affinity, and incubation time, is known as the Vroman effect [48].",

            "text": "We initially determined that PLGA nanoparticles enter the body as foreign objects, triggering an in ammatory response in ApoE \u2212/\u2212 mice. These nanoparticles were then engulfed by macrophages, migrated to sites of in ammation and eventually aggravated the formation of plaque. \n\nDuring the injection process, nanoparticles are rapidly coated with macromolecules forming a \"protein crown or corona (PC)\", which alters the size, aggregation state, surface charge and interfacial properties of the nanomaterials to create a biological identity that is distinct from its original synthetic identity. PLGA nanoparticles adsorbed a certain amount of proteins to form the PLGA + PC, with larger diameter and less stability, after incubation with mouse serum. Nanoparticles with protein coronas show completely different cell recognition or biological effects in vitro compared with in vivo [30] . \n\nMacrophages are the most important in ammatory cells in the process of AS lesion formation, are important components of lipid plaques, and serve as an important source of foam cells [40] . Therefore, we studied the effects of PLGA nanoparticles on macrophages in vitro. According to the MTS assay results, the activity of Raw 264.7 cells decreased with increasing concentrations of PLGA nanoparticles and PLGA + PC. The presence of the protein corona inhibited the phagocytosis of PLGA nanoparticles by Raw 264.7 cells. Studies have shown that the role of the protein corona in biological systems can be divided into \"opsonins\" and \"dysopsonins\" [41] . Opsonins promote macrophage phagocytosis, while dysopsonins inhibit phagocytosis. The structure and composition of the corona depend on the synthetic identity of the nanomaterial, which includes the chemistry, topography and curvature of the nanomaterial. Polymer nanoparticles possess various chemical compositions, free residues and morphologies (such as spheres, rods, vesicles, tubules and lamellae), which provide them with more diverse synthetic identities. After PLGA nanoparticles enter the blood stream, the surface-adsorbed dysopsonins may be more abundant and more stable.",

            "text": "Using super-resolution optical microscopy (STORM), Feiner-Gracia et al. (2017) were able to visualize the protein corona formed on mesoporous silica nanoparticles with single protein sensitivity and found a significant heterogeneity in protein absorption within the same nanoparticle population. Moreover, the authors demonstrated that changes in the corona composition occurred over time due to the chemistry and degradability of the particles, thus adding a further level of complexity to our understanding of the biological identity of nanomaterials (Feiner-Gracia et al., 2017). \n\nThe second, non-technical (and non-trivial) question refers to the biological \"meaning,\" if any, of all these proteins. It is well understood that the presence or absence of proteins, regardless of their identity, may influence the degree of agglomeration of nanoparticles. The question is whether there is a role for specific proteins in the bio-corona? Tenzer et al. (2013) performed comprehensive studies using a panel of PS nanoparticles and silica nanoparticles of various sizes displaying different surface charges and could show that the rapid formation of a plasma protein corona could modulate distinct pathophysiological effects as evidenced by the ex vivo analysis of platelet activation/aggregation and red blood cell lysis (i.e., hemolysis). However, the complexity of the protein corona precluded the assignment of specific proteins to account for these effects (and perhaps the effects were related to a shielding of the particle surface, thereby passivating the nanoparticles) (see, e.g., Hu et al., 2011, Lesniak et al., 2012). Indeed, we have shown that the cytotoxicity of silica nanoparticles is mitigated in the presence of serum whereas ZnO nanoparticles that undergo rapid dissolution are cytotoxic both in the absence and presence of serum (Shi et al., 2012).",

These advances require a complete understanding of nanoparticles' fate once placed in the body. Upon exposure to blood, proteins adsorb onto the nanoparticles surface and form a protein corona, which determines the particles' biological fate. This study reports on the protein corona formation from blood serum and plasma on spherical and rod-shaped nanoparticles. These two types of mesoporous silica nanoparticles have identical chemistry, porosity, surface potential, and size in the y-dimension, one being a sphere and the other a rod shape. The results show a significantly larger amount of protein attaching from both plasma and serum on the rod-like particles compared to the spheres. Interrogation of the protein corona by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry reveals shape-dependent differences in the adsorption of immunoglobulins and albumin proteins from both plasma and serum. This study points to the need for taking nanoparticle shape into consideration because it can have a significant impact on the fate and therapeutic potential of nanoparticles when placed in the body.",

            "text": "There is limited understanding of the presence of lipid molecules and their adsorption on nanocarriers in the scientific research. In the blood, a lipid associated with protein is known as a lipoprotein. It is complex of apolipoprotein, cholesterol, triglycerides, and phospholipids [106]. Apart from the transportation of lipoprotein in a biological fluid, it is also associated with several other biological processes including tissue repair, coagulation, and immunological responses. \n\nThe proteomic data have suggested that a significant amount of apolipoproteins are present in the protein corona of nanomaterials in vivo. Hellstrand and associates highlighted a report of lipid and plasma protein interaction with nanocarriers. They first pointed out the interaction of lipoprotein complexes with nanomaterials [107]. The surfaceactive agent present in the pulmonary route constituted the outset host defense in deeper part of lungs. The inhaled nanoparticle primarily formed a different corona protein due to the interaction with the lipid and the surfactant-rich pulmonary surface, but the protein corona formed here was different from the PC formed by plasma protein. Further, Raesch and coworkers presented the proteomic analysis of corona formation on NPs using a porcine surfactant as a prototype. The study analyzed the adsorbed biomolecules using LC-MS on to the surface of NPs with varying characteristics viz. lipid-NP, PEG, and PLGA NPs with incubation in a porcine surfactant. The quantitative measurements showed specific lipid compositions in coronas of all investigated NPs. The hydrophilic PEG NPs only showed minimal lipid concentrations, while other NPs indicated high lipid surface binding to nanomaterials. However, the corona formed on NPs was different from corona of plasma protein [108]. \n\nFor the application of nanomaterials in clinics, the physico-chemical properties have to be critically evaluated in a biological medium and the estimation of the results of in vivo studies will greatly help in the clinical translation of nanomaterials. The mouse model is widely used in nanomedicine research to investigate the corona on NPs by incubation with mouse serum.",

            "text": "One key biological interaction is protein fouling, or protein corona formation, where proteins adsorb to the nanoparticle surface upon exposure to serum. This protein corona can cause instability, immune system recognition, or potentially beneficial adsorption of dysopsonins for prolonging circulation time (124). Feiner-Gracia et al. found that within a nanoparticle population there were significant differences in protein corona radius and identity, leading to the conclusion that even small differences in native nanoparticle surface chemistry were amplified upon protein adsorption to yield particles with distinct biological identity (84). Therefore, as was recently recognised, a better understanding and modulation of the complex surface interactions of nanomedicines in biological environments is key for aiding clinical translation (107,125). Utilising single particle the protein binding affinity and kinetics (85). An alternative FCS technique is to randomly label plasma and then to mix with unlabelled nanoparticles to detecting protein fouling, which is a highly sensitive method but requires using diluted plasma or studying individually labelled plasma proteins (70). Nevertheless, observed differences between PEG-decorated polymersomes and liposomes provided important links between the copolymer membrane material properties, particle PEG-density and resulting corona formation. Meanwhile, staining specific serum proteins with multiple fluorophores for SMLM visualisation enables quantification of the relative protein content in the corona formed on individual nanoparticle (126). \n\nBesides protein corona formation, there are many other nanoparticle-biological interactions that can be studied on a single particle level, including enzymatic changes to surface chemistry. SPARTA\u00ae was used to characterise the kinetics of enzymatic conversion of lipid headgroups from phosphatidylcholine to phosphatidic acid on a single particle level in Barriga et al. (69), including reaction kinetics (Fig. 5e). The ability to characterise stimuli-responsive compositional changes on the surface of nanoparticles provides the opportunity for optimisation of \"smart\" nanocarriers for targeted delivery prior to in vivo studies.",

            "text": "Nanoplastics (NPs), a major global environmental problem [1], are more damaging [2] due to their size and features and pose a potential threat to biosecurity [3], human health [4], and so on. Nanoparticles, including NPs, have a negative impact on plants and animals through the accumulation and transmission of food chains [5]. Because of their nanoscale, large specific surface area, and strong adsorption, nanoparticles may interact with biomolecules such as proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and other biological metabolites in the biological environment [6], forming a corona on their surface called \"protein corona\" [7]. On the one hand, the formation of the protein corona (PC) may alter the size, surface charge, aggregation state, and other structural properties of nanoparticles, directly or indirectly leading to biological properties that differ from the original ones [8,9], which is mainly because the adsorbed protein further modifies nanoparticles' surface [10], so the nanoparticles' interaction with protein is controlled [11]. On the other hand, the formation of the PC may alter protein conformation, exposing new novel epitopes and producing avidity effects arising from the close spatial repetition of the same protein [12]. The PC may also disrupt protein structures [13], causing a perturbed function triggered by structural effects or local high concentration, which may further affect its agglomeration, absorption, and toxicity [14]. For instance, the formation of the PC mitigates the toxic effects of different surface-modified PS NPs towards marine microalgae Chlorella sp. [15]. \n\nPolystyrene (PS) NPs have a unique adsorption capability, high surface area to volume ratio, high surface curvature, and high mobile properties. Thus, they are widely used to produce a variety of consumer products in life, such as food packaging, nanocomposites, nanomedicine, and cosmetics [16]. Additionally, it can be exposed to the environment for a long time, so it deserves widespread attention.",

            "text": "Identifying the function and composition of the protein corona (i.e., the set of host proteins interacting with nanoparticles) is considered a crucial step in the development of nanoparticles for medical and pharmacological applications. Evidence suggests that host proteins can alter NP stability, biocompatibility, and pharmacokinetics features. Therefore, in this review, we provide an updated conceptual, methodological, and experimental guideline for the study of the NP protein corona. We surveyed recent literature (2009\u20132024) focusing on in vitro and in vivo studies. We show that several methods, including shot-gun proteomics, protein identification after in-gel digestion, and TMT proteomics, must be carefully applied and integrated to shed light on this complex phenomenon. Hence, we discuss in detail the relative protocols, highlighting the importance of the experimental conditions, ranging from the administration route to basic, but determinant, parameters like the kind of biological host fluids, the incubation times and the NP concentrations. Additionally, we propose a series of protocols that involve studying the protein corona using purified serum or plasma proteins, as well as sera depleted of specific complement proteins, to investigate the role of their deposition on the nanoparticle surface. We also explore how the role of the protein corona in inducing uptake by phagocytic cells can be examined; finally, we discuss several methodological approaches to study the effects of different coatings on the composition of the protein corona. Available data indicated that it is possible to characterize and punctually study the differential adsorption of specific proteins onto the nanoparticle surface. This allows designing NP chemical coatings features to actively guide the protein corona formation, thus improving nanotheranostic development.",

            "text": "The interaction of nanoparticles with physiological systems-the so-called \"nano-bio interface\"-is a complex process. It is therefore important to understand this mechanism in some detail before we delve into strategies to bypass first-pass metabolism. As we discussed, a nanoparticle's inherent composition, shape, size, and surface chemistry plays a crucial part in deciding its fate in systemic circulation. In this section, we discuss the role of two external parameters that play equally vital roles to affect circulation stability and the final disposition of a nanoparticle to the tumor: (i) formation of a protein corona and (ii) the mechanism of interactions between the nanoparticle and cells. \n\nWhen a nanoparticle enters the blood, it is coated with various serum proteins, forming a protein corona that changes the nanoparticle's synthetic identity, exposes new epitopes, and alters its function. The concept of a protein corona is thus an important parameter in shaping the final biological identity of the nanoparticle-hydrodynamic size, surface chemistry, net charge, and aggregation behavior [30,32,64]. Although this has been known for a long time, it is only recently that researchers were able to decipher the complex mixture of adsorbed proteins on nanoparticles. This was mainly led by the advancement of instrumentation and analytical methods, coupled with the motivation to shake the existing stagnancy of clinical translation for nanomedicine delivery systems [65][66][67]. Albumin, apolipoprotein, immunoglobulins, transferrin, fibrinogen, complement C3, haptoglobin, and \u03b1-2-macroglobulin are some of the most abundant proteins that comprise the protein corona [32,68]. Nanoparticles interact with these proteins mainly through long range electrostatic Van der Waal's forces, as well as short-range hydrophobic interactions [33]. There are two types of proteins in the protein corona [65,66]: opsonin and dysopsonin.",

Cell membrane-coated nanoparticles' unique abilities to biomimic and biointerface with cell membranes not only give them certain physiochemical properties, such as high cargo loading and great stability under high shear-stress conditions [24,28,29], but also make them tunable to have certain biological functions, such as long circulation, targeted recognition, enhanced accumulation in disease sites, and deep tumor penetration [30][31][32]. \n\nIn addition, bare nanoparticles usually adsorb biomolecules in plasma and/or intracellular fluid in vivo and form a biological coating on their surface, namely protein corona owing to high surface free energy of nanomaterials [33]. The composition of protein corona varies depending on the composition, size, and surface modification of the nanomaterial, as well as the environment surrounding the nanomaterial. This protein corona may shield the specific surface structure and cover the targeting ligand, thus hindering the specific reaction between the nanoparticle and its target, which greatly affects the nanoparticles' fate and may results in removal of nanoparticles from the bloodstream [34][35][36]. Therefore, it is crucial to avoid the formation of protein corona in the development of nanomaterials for biological or biomedical application. However, having a cell membrane coating around the nanoparticles can successfully prevent nanomaterials from forming a protein corona. \n\nAs the interface between the cell and the outside world, the cell membrane is perfectly compatible with biofluids, effectively blocking the interactions between the nanomaterials and biological system. This strategy allows nanoparticles to navigate more effectively within the body, thereby limiting off-target side effects, significantly regulating immune responses and, ultimately, enhancing treatment efficacy and expanding the application range of nanomaterials [37,38].",

            "text": "Previous investigations have predominantly utilized nanoparticles that are considerably larger in size than serum proteins, leading to the characterization of nanoparticles as the \"carriers\" and the proteins as the \"cargo\" [74]. It has been postulated that this understanding of protein corona design and biological effects could be extended to ultra-small nanoparticles with diameters smaller than 10 nm [75]. Before delving into the interaction of proteins with ultra-small nanoparticles, we will briefly review the concept of single-chain PNPs and the existing methods for synthesizing such nanoparticles. \n\nDepending on the targeted particle size and desired applications, several synthetic techniques have been developed. The top-down technique involves mini-and microemulsion systems to produce crosslinked nanoparticles through nanoemulsified solvent methods, resulting in nanoparticles with diameters smaller than 50 nm. Conversely, a novel bottom-up strategy based on the crosslinking of self-assembled block copolymer micelles has yielded a broad spectrum of particles. However, the synthesis of extremely small particles requires more intricate methods, such as dendrimers, which range in size from 1 to 10 nm [76]. \n\nThe intra-molecular chain collapse method facilitates the production of higher quantities of nanoparticles in the 3-15 nm size range. The number of functionalities is regulated by the structure of the linear precursor, resulting in the extremely accurate fabrication of PNPs within a particularly restricted size range. Although the synthesis is carried out in an extremely diluted setting (0.5 \u00b5g L \u22121 ) at the outset, the use of highly effective crosslinking processes and permanent addition systems allows for the fabrication to be carried out at higher concentrations [77]. Stimuli-sensitive nanoparticles have been reported to be produced using this technique, involving supra-molecular reactions that facilitate swelling of the structures in response to UV irradiation and pH changes [78][79][80]. \n\nAs an important parameter in protein corona assembly, PNP or nanogel size affects the nature and composition of the protein corona. Moreover, the biological milieu around the nanosystem also influences the composition of the protein corona (Figure 6).",

            "text": "The question about the significance (and role) of a protein corona on different classes of nanoparticles cannot be answered in a \"general sense\". This is not due to an inherent issue with the nanodimensions of the particles. Instead, it arises from the nature of the nanosystem (nanoparticles and plasma proteins, forming a mixed colloidal system) having an especially large surface area. Thus the system is -to some extend-instable [7,9,74] and the deposition of some plasma proteins -with time-on the nanoparticles is \"likely\". As a result, the popular assertion that any nanoparticle forms a protein corona upon contact with blood plasma is generally true for nearly all nanoparticles. However, some nanoparticles designed for nanomedicine applications do not absorb any proteins and, therefore, do not form a protein corona. This occurs for well-understood reasons: the cores of these nanoparticles are coated with a dense layer of strongly hydrated, hydrophilic polymers, which effectively keep plasma proteins away. This is achieved through a combination of a bound water layer and entropic shielding. \n\nThe next question is: How important is the formation of a protein corona. Now, corona formation can be studied, and the results provides certain insights into highly complex systems. Work on this topic accounts for about 1.500 publications up to the middle of 2022. [7] It excludes, however, mostly the question, if corona formation is unavoidable. In our opinion, the real significance of corona formation has to come, however, from the interest to use nanoparticles in the broad field of nanomedicine. And here, the formation of a protein corona -at least in cases, when corona formation is strong-is disadvantageous. That is because nanomedicine wants to use nanoparticles in patients differing -to a certain extend-in serum protein composition. A central idea is thereby to decouple the pharmacological action of an active compound from its body distribution (e.g., to bring drugs into a tumor, or to bring an antigen and adjuvant to immune cells in the skin, spleen or lymph nodes.",

            "text": "To systematically study the LNPs and their newly formed corona, the unbound proteins must be separated after their in vivo administration or in vitro incubation with blood, plasma, or serum. However, a precise characterization of the BMC of soft nanomaterials, such as LNPs has proven difficult as the size and density of LNPs are similar to \"natural\" serum nanoparticles, for instance, chylomicrons, HDL, exosomes, and many more (19). \n\nCommon separation techniques such as size exclusion chromatography (SEC) or (ultra)centrifugation are based on, respectively, size or density, and therefore they can work well for the study of bigger or dense NPs (23) but do not allow an effective separation of LNP (30 to 100 nm) from lipoproteins and related nanostructures (7 to 80 nm) present in biological media (19). In addition, as a high g-force is commonly required in (ultra)centrifugation, proteins and LNP can aggregate and induce artifacts resulting in difficulty differentiating between unbound vs. adsorbed proteins. The lack of effective and high-throughput separation techniques for soft nanomaterials has led to alternative procedures such as cross-linking proteins on the LNP surface (24,25). This effectively removes the presence of unbounded proteins but potentially disrupts the proteins present on an intact LNP surface. Furthermore, a photoaffinity lipid probe is required in the LNP formulation which can also alter the BMC formation and profile due to deviations from clinically relevant lipid compositions. In some cases, affinity assays have been used for isolating the corona of PEGylated nanomedicines (26). However, since many affinity-based assays rely on ligand binding to the polyethylene glycol (PEG) lipid, LNPs that contains diffusible PEG that are engineered to shed from the particle surface (i.e., Onpattro) may not be suitable for this method. \n\nIn this work, we demonstrate a magnetic separation (MS) technique that enables the study of LNP's BMC in a manner that is independent of their surface properties.",

            "text": "11][12][13]. Pulmonary surfactant can be adsorbed by particulate matter producing a bio-nano interface referred as protein/lipid corona. Although most of studies focused on the protein/lipid corona formed by interactions of nanoparticles with plasma, more recently some attention has been paid also to other biological fluids such as ALF [13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22]. Unlike the protein corona formed in plasma, that is attributable to interactions between nanoparticles and proteins, the corona layer formed around inhaled nanoparticles proved to differ markedly, because it preserves a lipid composition regardless of nanoparticle surface properties. This finding was related to the high content of phospholipids (about 80-90%) present in the pulmonary surfactant [12,19]. Such a corona formed around the particles is described to be affected by particle size, shape, surface charge, covalent/coordinate bonding or hydrogen bonding propensity, hydrophobicity, and surface functional groups as well as environment composition and exposure duration. Among these parameters, the surface hydrophobicity and charge density play a more significant role [23,24]. It is known that corona can deeply influence the interaction of nanoparticles with cells and determine not only the nanoparticle fate, but also their properties such as aggregate formation, pulmonary clearance, receptor-mediated transport, and drug release behavior [15,16,18,19,[25][26][27], although some discordant results have also been reported. For example, corona layer was found to impair nanoparticle adhesion onto cell surface or to decrease particle uptake by macrophages [16,28,29]. On the other hand, some studies reported an improved cell internalization [14,[30][31][32]. Therefore, the implications of corona layer on AM targeting using inhalable carriers remain still an open issue that needs to be further explored.\n\nWithin this context, respirable Solid Lipid Nanoparticle assemblies (SLNas) loaded with rifampicin, a clinically useful anti-tuberculosis drug, were previously produced as inhaled",

However, most of these efforts proceed in a \"trial and error\" 423 manner. How these designs can affect delivery efficacy and tissue tropism is largely unpredictable, 424 particularly due to the tremendous diversity of pathophysiological conditions. This severely 425 hinders the development of personalized precision nanomedicine. Understanding corona formation 426 is, on the other hand, an emerging approach for optimizing nanomedicine design towards desirable 427 biological outcomes. 428\n\nOur study demonstrated that individual physiological states can affect LNP function through 429 corona formation. The heterogeneity amongst patients/diseases can hinder the success of clinical 430 nanomedicines, whereas most nanomedicine studies are carried out in unstratified patient 431 populations 52 and, our data suggest that corona composition is more predictive than plasma biomarkers. For example, although animal 12 was classified as obese using relevant biomarkers, 433 its plasma resulted in an LNP corona composition closer to lean plasma-derived corona and eGFP 434 expression similar to the lean group. Our study is the first to show wew LNP designs, informed by 435 corona composition generated in a stratified patient populations or individuals, can improve the 436 delivery of and response to, nanomedicine therapies. 437 Therefore, unbiased corona analysis is essential for decoding the relationships between LNP 438 composition, corona composition, and LNP function. Using a streamlined process for corona 439 isolation, multi-omics corona assessment, and multivariate analysis, we successfully pinpointed 440 HDL as a determinate of LNP mRNA delivery and expression efficacy and, we confirmed this by 441 adding exogenous HDL. Interestingly, we uncovered a relationship between how HDL is 442 associated with the LNP coronas, the amount of free HDL and the cellular capacity for HDL-443 mediated uptake. At higher plasma concentrations, free HDL functioned antagonistically, whereas 444 reduced plasma concentrations resulted in lower free HDL, greater particle uptake and, 445 subsequently, improved mRNA expression. At the lowest lean plasma concentrations, there was 446 not enough HD",

The interactions between NPs and plasma proteins at the nano-bio interface affect their biopharmaceutical properties and distribution in the organ and tissues due to protein corona (PrC) composition, and in turn, modification of the resulting targeting capability. Moreover, lipid and polymer NPs, at their interface, affect the composition of PrC and the relative adsorption and abundance of specific proteins. To investigate this latter aspect, we synthesized and characterized different liposomal formulations (LFs) with lipids and polymer-conjugated lipids at different molar ratios, having different sizes, size distributions and surface charges. The PrC composition of various designed LFs was evaluated ex vivo in human plasma by label-free quantitative proteomics. We also correlated the relative abundance of identified specific proteins in the coronas of the different LFs with their physicochemical properties (size, PDI, zeta potential). The evaluation of outputs from different bioinformatic tools discovered protein clusters allowing to highlight: (i) common as well as the unique species for the various formulations; (ii) correlation between each identified PrC and the physicochemical properties of LFs; (iii) some preferential binding determined by physicochemical properties of LFs; (iv) occurrence of formulation-specific protein patterns in PrC. Investigating specific clusters in PrC will help decode the multivalent roles of the protein pattern components in the drug delivery process, taking advantage of the bio-nanoscale recognition and identification for significant advances in nanomedicine.",

To fully exploit the potential of LNPs for the delivery of nucleic acid-based therapies across various indications, a better understanding of the mechanisms by which LNPs interact with the biochemical environment they are intended to function in is necessary. \n\nThe study of proteins adsorbed to NPs during circulation, also referred to as the protein corona, has been a hot topic for many years in the drug delivery field. However, protein corona studies are very challenging, particularly when studying lipid-based NPs such as liposomes and LNPs. This is partly due to: (i) the coexistence of compositional, mass density, and size-similar endogenous NPs in blood plasma, including high-density lipoproteins (HDL), low-density lipoproteins (LDL), very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), chylomicrons, and EVs complicating selective purification of exogenous lipid-based NPs from plasma 2 ; and (ii) inherent limitations in tools used for NP characterization. These limitations are put into context below by discussing some of the key findings presented by Liu et al. \n\nTo validate that their PEG affinity-based LNP isolation method avoids contamination by lipoproteins, EVs and other plasma components, Liu et al. analyzed pull-down fractions from rat blood plasma samples which were incubated with either pegylated LNPs or pure PEGlipids (non-LNP control) with dot blots based on PEG-antibody staining (Fig. 1a) 1 . LNPs isolated from plasma from either an obese (OP) or lean (LP) rat model with the pull-down method exhibit strong PEG-antibody signals, while pull-down fractions from the non-LNP control only show faint signals.",

Li et al. recently designed LNPs targeted to plasmalemma vehicle-associated protein (PV1), known to be associated with lung endothelial caveolae, through conjugation of DLin-MC3-DMA LNPs (DSPC:Chol:DMG-PEG:DSPE-PEG maleimide, 50:10:38:1.75:0.25) to a Fab-C4 caveolae-targeting nanobody, and demonstrated significantly higher targeting specificity of PV1-targeted LNPs to mouse lungs compared to the control LNPs after i.v. administration [ 208 ]. Interestingly, increasing LNP size from 70 to 160 nm in this study further directed LNPs out of the lymphatics towards the lungs. The fluidic nature of the LNPs is advantageous, here: nanoparticle elasticity has been shown to be crucial for effective PV1-targeting when vehicle size is over 100 nm [ 209 ]. Modulation of the mRNA:lipid ratio also impacted localization of the LNPs: a mRNA:lipid (N/P) ratio of 3 trafficked predominantly to lungs, whereas a mRNA:lipid (N/P) ratio of 10 localized similarly between the lungs and the spleen, likely consistent with a higher proportion of cationic lipid in a given formulation mix (i.e., at a mRNA:lipid ratio of 3) appearing to favor lung targeting and expression.",

This welldocumented phenomenon, observed with all nano-objects, is a rapid process, leading to the formation of a protein corona at the surface of nanovectors, with a dynamic remodeling over time in blood [78][79][80][81]. Proteomics analyses performed on various NPs incubated with serum demonstrated that numerous plasma proteins (>100 different proteins and peptides) bind onto nano-vectors, including immunoglobulins, lipoproteins, complement, coagulation factors, and many others [78][79][80][81]93]. Authors have brought evidence that the protein corona formation and dynamics might depend on the physicochemical features of the nanovectors, including rigidity, hydrophilic, or hydrophobic surface, as well as charged or neutral zeta potential [93]. Proteins interact with NPs by different mechanisms, mainly electrostatic, hydrophobic, and hydrogen-bonding [93]. Lipoproteins, especially apolipoproteins E and A-I, are particularly enriched in NP's protein corona, most likely through direct interaction with lipids, in case of liposomes and lipid NPs [94,95], as well as the hydrophobic core of polymeric NPs [78][79][80][81]. Interestingly, reports have recently shown that proteins within the corona, including the ApoE, induce structural rearrangements that may impact their cell internalization and overall biodistribution in vivo [93]. \n\nIn order to reduce opsonization and scavenging by MPS, NPs have been optimized through the modulation of their size, shape [2], surface charge [96], and chemical structure [97][98][99], including the synthesis of amphiphilic copolymers with a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) block.",

            "text": "This \ue103nding is not in agreement with previous studies where nanorods were reported to adsorb more proteins than nanospheres of similar size, thanks to their small curvature. 19,45 This discrepancy can be due to the fact that the nanoparticles used in these studies were of different chemical nature (gold and silica) and of different sizes (10 and 270 nm for nanospheres and 10-35 and 270-1100 nm for nanorods). The nanoparticle-surface area ratios used were also different (0.003 and 0.05 m 2 mL \u00c01 ). This argues for a complex picture where several parameters are concomitantly involved. \n\nS2 and P25 nanoparticles exhibited similar pattern suggesting that nanoparticle agglomeration state does not play a major role in the formation of the protein corona. On the contrary, by comparing the protein coronas of S2 and S4 (amine-functionalized form of S2) nanoparticles, we clearly observed a signi\ue103cant impact of the nanoparticle surface charge on the formation of a protein corona, con\ue103rming previous studies. However, it was quite surprising to observe that protein coronas were preferentially formed on negatively charged nanoparticles. Indeed, it is generally admitted that charged particles tend to adsorb more proteins than neutral nanoparticles. 12,16,17,20 The logical explanation is that, negatively charged particles attract positively charged proteins and vice versa. But, proteins contained in FBS are largely negative for a pH around 8, it should thus be reasonable to expect a larger protein binding to nanoparticles which surface is positively charged. However, this simpli\ue103ed statement does not \ue103t all circumstances. 12,46,47 And our \ue103nding is consistent with those of Bewersdorff et al. 48 who reported that serum proteins preferably bound to negatively charged nanoparticles compared to positively charged ones. Tenzer et al. 18 also demonstrated that, at physiological pH (7.3), proteins in general with negative charge were preferentially bound by negatively charged SiO 2 nanoparticles irrespective of their relative plasma abundance.",

            "text": "Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is used in Lipid Nanoparticles (LNPs) formulations to confer stealth properties and is traditionally anchored in membranes by a lipid moiety whose length significantly impacts the LNPs fate in vivo. C18 acyl chains are efficiently anchored in the membrane, while shorter C14 lipids are quickly desorbed and replaced by a protein corona responsible for the completely different fate of LNPs. In this context, a method to predict the biological behavior of LNPs depending on the lipid-PEG dissociation was developed using the Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA) method in serum. Two formulations of siRNA-containing LNPs were prepared including CSL3 or SM-102 lipids and were grafted with different lipids-PEG (C18, C14 lipids-PEG, and Ceramide-PEG). The impact of the lipid-PEG on the interactions between LNPs and serum components was demonstrated by monitoring the mean particle size and the concentration over time. In vitro, these formulations demonstrated low toxicity and efficient gene knockdown on tumor MDA-MB-231 cells, but serum was found to significantly impact the efficiency of C18-PEG-based LNPs, while it did not impact the efficiency of C14-PEG-based LNPs. The NTA method demonstrated the ability to discriminate between the behaviors of LNPs according to serum proteins\u2019 interactions. CSL3 lipid and Cer-PEG were confirmed to have promise for LNP formulation.",

            "text": "The physicochemical properties of the protein corona and its evolution with time have been shown to affect the behavior of nanoparticles in biological environments to a large extent [1,11,28,162]. Our current understanding suggests that initially a \"soft\" protein corona, with a highly dynamic exchange of proteins, is formed around NPs. Changing its composition over time, the \"soft\" corona slowly evolves to a \"hard\" corona with less dynamic exchange [112,162,163]. Previous studies investigating nanomaterial exposure to complex biological environments [3,8,41,112,162] have largely failed to allow for the highly dynamic situation of physiological systems. Coronacarrying NPs may need to instantly react to external stimuli under such conditions as exemplified by considering the blood system where processes controlling haemostasis and thrombosis may be triggered on a timescale of minutes [28]. \n\nTenzer and co-workers [10] recently developed a new experimental approach allowing for a time-resolved determination of NP-specific fingerprints. This method, based on label-free liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS), allows for an insight into the time-evolution of the full serum protein corona. Such information, especially for short exposure times, is urgently needed to understand the interactions between NPs and biological systems. Briefly, they used their LC-MS based method to measure time-resolved corona compositions on silica and polystyrene NPs in human serum. By using NPs of various sizes (diameters of about 35, 120, 140 nm), and surface functionalities (amine, carboxylate, unmodified), they were able to provide insights into the consequences of these factors for corona composition and dynamics. \n\nThey demonstrated in their study that coronas were formed very rapidly, and showed an unexpected complexity regarding composition and dynamics on all of the NPs under investigation. They quantitatively detected 166 different plasma proteins within the corona after 0.5 min. The number of individual proteins quantified in the corona increased to almost 300 on the different types of NPs at prolonged exposure times (up to 480 min).",

            "text": "It is now well understood that upon coming into contact with NPs in the biological medium, different biomolecules such as proteins, lipids, and glycans will compete to interact with the NP surface to form a layer called protein corona [23,24,29]. For instance, in the case of intravenous administration of the NPs, blood plasma proteins adsorb to the surface of NP to form protein corona [23,[30][31][32]. In the case of other administrative routes, NPs will react with other biomolecules of the body fluids primarily before reaching the blood plasma. Protein corona is a dynamic layer and its composition changes with time due to ongoing protein absorption and desorption [19,29]. It is worth remarking that protein corona is the primary contact to the cell. Therefore, what the biological entity sees when it comes into contact with NPs is the protein corona formed at that specific time [19,29,33]. The composition of protein corona for each nanomaterial is unique and is influenced by many parameters such as physicochemical properties of NPs and characteristics of the environment [25]. \n\nThe formation of protein corona causes a reduction in the surface energy and toxicity of the NP as compared to the \"bare\" particle. In general, protein corona changes the size, surface chemistry, and surface charge of the NP, thereby affecting its uptake, biodistribution, and cellular fate [18,24]. Protein corona is formed at the bio-nano interface by the aid of several forces such as hydrodynamic, electrodynamic, and electrostatic or steric forces and solvent and polymer bridging. These forces also determine the kind of structure that protein corona may form at these interfaces. Structure of protein corona can be evaluated in the physiological environment (i.e., in situ) or after isolation from the physiological environment (i.e., ex situ). Techniques such as differential centrifugation (DC) or size exclusion chromatography (SEC) are utilized for isolation of protein corona. Different parameters of protein corona such as thickness, protein identity, protein quantity density, protein-NP affinity, and protein conformation can be analyzed and quantified using various analytical tools [24,25].",

            "text": "While surface charge impacts protein adsorption, it operates within a complex electrostatic environment, which could explain the subtler differences in protein-charge profiles compared with pI trends. These findings suggest that lipid composition influences not only protein adsorption but also the physicochemical characteristics of the corona, impacting organ-specific delivery. \n\nTo further investigate protein-corona-driven targeting, we analyzed the top 30 most abundant proteins in lung-and spleen-targeting LNP coronas (Tables S5-S10). Additionally, to provide a clearer interpretation of the results, we focused on proteins that were highly enriched in one organ-specific LNP corona while being absent or barely detected in the other (Figure 4E,F). Results showed that the predominant proteins absorbed in spleentargeting LNPs are actin, myosin, and the immunoglobulin lambda-like protein. These proteins exhibit a low correlation and are typically nonspecific and are often found in negative mass spectrometry controls. Therefore, the mechanism underlying spleen targeting remains unclear. However, the protein-corona composition of lung-targeting LNPs was clearly distinct from that of liver-and spleen-targeting LNPs. Notably, vitronectin and prothrombin, both extensively reported as key protein-corona components influencing lung targeting, were among the most enriched proteins [12,13,27]. These findings suggest that lung-targeting LNPs in our ionizable lipid library follow previously described mechanisms of proteincorona-mediated lung selectivity.",

            "text": "Selection of an appropriate surface coating may increase the biocompatibility of QDs in physiological conditions. For example, polymer coatings, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), have been reported to successfully passivate the surface and increase the chemical stability of QDs, reducing their degradation (Wang et al., 2013). \n\nAnother important aspect to consider, when working with nanoparticles in complex environments, is the nonspecific interaction with proteins. Biological fluids contain a variety of proteins, which may adsorb on the surface of nanoparticles and create a layer called the protein corona (Ashraf et al., 2016;Motevalian et al., 2020;Nakatsuka et al., 2018c;Perng et al., 2019;Salvati et al., 2013;Song et al., 2020). Such protein coronas may trigger the aggregation of the nanoparticles, which consequently impairs their functionality and/or significantly reduces their retention time in blood (Salvati et al., 2013). The chemical nature of the surface coating of nanoparticles have been reported as key factors in the formation of the protein corona (Ashraf et al., 2016;Perng et al., 2019). For instance, while PEG coatings in general reduce the protein adsorption on QDs, amine-terminated PEG still induces protein corona formation, while carboxyl-decorated PEG significantly reduces protein adsorption (Perng et al., 2019). \n\nHowever, in some cases, protein corona formation may have beneficial effects on the properties of QDs (Frutiger et al., 2021). For example, the protein corona on thioglycolic acid-coated CdTe QDs increased their fluorescence by inducing the rearrangement of the surface coating and subsequently reducing surface defects (Motevalian et al., 2020). In addition, carefully regulated protein coronas has been harnessed to cloak nanoparticles from rapid clearance by the immune system for targeted drug delivery (Rampado et al., 2020;Oh et al., 2018). Further, human serum albumin protein corona formation has been shown to mitigate the toxicity of carbon QDs (Song et al., 2020).",

The mass spectrometric analysis revealed alterations in particle size, zeta potential, and the composition of the protein. The size of the corona particle was quantified by estimating the level of triglycerides and the cholesterol presence across the NPs' surface. Overall, the results showed that the lipid had a significant impact on the formation of bio-corona.

However, these strategies are still limited at conferring targeting specificity since an additional targeting ligand increases the propensity for protein corona formation to mask the targeting ability and inhibit the biological effects of nanoparticles [18][19][20][21][22][23][24] . This can explain why many nanoparticles with active targeting systems have failed in clinical trials 25 . Therefore, to design nanoparticle-based therapeutic agents, there is a considerable need to regulate protein corona formation on nanoparticles [26][27][28] and to obtain a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanism involved in regulating nanoparticle-biological interactions. Here, we present a targeting system in which nanoparticles are supramolecularly precoated with a protein corona shield (PCS) that reduce serum protein absorption while retaining targeting specificity (Fig. 1a).",

            "text": "Over the past few decades, nanoparticle-based therapeutic and diagnostic systems have gained immense recognition. A relative improvement in the status of the global cancer burden has been successful due to the advent of nanoparticle-based formulations. However, exposure of nanoparticles (NPs) to a real-time biological media alters its native identity due to the formation of the biomolecular corona. Such biological interactions hinder the efficiency of the NPs system. The parameters that govern such intricate interaction are generally overlooked while designing nano drugs and delivery systems (nano-DDS). Fabricating nano-DDS with prolonged circulation time, enhanced drug-loading, and release capacity along with efficient clearance, remain the primary concerns associated with cancer therapeutics. This present review firstly aims to summarize the critical aspects that influence protein coronation on therapeutic nanoparticles designed for anti-cancer therapy. The role of protein corona in modifying the overall pharmacodynamics of the nanoparticle-based DDS has been discussed. Further, the studies and patents that extend the concept of protein corona into diagnostics have been elaborated. An understanding of the pros and cons associated with protein coronation would not only help us gain better insights into the fabrication of effective anti-cancer drug-delivery systems but also improve the shortcomings related to the clinical translation of these nanotherapeutics.",

            "text": "Upon coming into contact with the biological environment, nanostructures are immediately covered by biomolecules, particularly by proteins forming the so-called \u201cprotein corona\u201d (PC). The phenomenon of PC formation has gained great attention in recent years due to its implication in the use of nanostructures in biomedicine. In fact, it has been shown that the formation of the PC can impact the performance of nanostructures by reducing their stability, causing aggregation, increasing their toxicity, and providing unexpected and undesired nanostructure\u2013cell interactions. In this work, we decided to study for the first time the formation and the evolution of PC on the surface of nanostructured lipid carriers loaded with superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles, before and after the crossing of an in vitro model of the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB). Combining confocal microscopy, direct STochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (dSTORM), and proteomic analysis, we were able to carry out a complete analysis of the PC formation and evolution. In particular, we highlighted that PC formation is a fast process, being formed around particles even after just 1 min of exposure to fetal bovine serum. Moreover, PC formed around particles is extremely heterogeneous: while some particles have no associated PC at all, others are completely covered by proteins. Lastly, the interaction with an in vitro BBB model strongly affects the PC composition: in particular, a large amount of the proteins forming the initial PC is lost after the BBB passage and they are partially replaced by new proteins derived from both the brain endothelial cells and the cell culture medium. Altogether, the obtained data could potentially provide new insights into the design and fabrication of lipid nanostructures for the treatment of central nervous system disorders.",

            "text": "Nanoparticle protein corona is the self-assembly of absorbed proteins on the particle surface. \n\nThe nanoparticle surface and size determine the amount, identity, polarity, and arrangement of the protein corona, while also influencing downstream effects of distribution, metabolism, and excretion [29,30,34]. Depending on the biomedical application, the formation of a protein corona could either be efficacious or produce an ineffective biological response [35,36]. Previous studies show that the protein corona can act as a cloaking shield during targeted drug delivery; a pre-coating of proteins may reduce the particle-protein interactions in vitro. In contrast, the development of the protein corona on the surface of the nanomedicine may render the therapeutic agent detrimental by routing the medicine to undesired targets [37]. \n\nScenario 2 represents interactions between nanoparticles and lung interstitial fluid after inoculation and incubation; the available information from the published literature indicates that nanoparticle surfaces can be exploited to promote lipid raft transport across membranes [38,39]. Interactions with lipids induce changes in surface properties as nanoparticles pass through cytoplasmic, mitochondrial, or nuclear membranes. Kang et al. (2008a and2008b) showed that positively charged AgNPs facilitate stable transport across olefin/paraffin separation membranes [40,41]. However, once internalized by the cell, the metal-based nanoparticles are likely to be shuttled into lysosomes, where ions dissociate and induce cellular toxicity. Recent efforts have been aimed at preparing nanoparticle surface coatings to shuttle active pharmaceutical ingredients into the cytoplasmic membrane and avoid cellular internalization. Identifying the surface charge and coating that partially interacts with lipid membranes while avoiding intracellular acidification aids in reducing adverse effects of nano-enabled drug carriers [42]. \n\nScenario 3 represents ingestion and digestion of orally administered nanoparticles. Most studies focus on AgNPs used in food products [43]. Cueva et al. (2019) showed that nanoparticles in simulated digestion fluid are structurally different post-digestion but do not alter the microbiota viability [44].",

            "text": "As mentioned before, the constitution of the protein corona is mainly dependent on the composition of the biological medium where it's inserted [19,20], as different physiological environments have different proteins that compose them. The protein corona is also dependent on the time of exposure [11,17,20], chemical properties of the nanoparticle applied [23], and, in some cases, size and surface of the nanoparticle [23]. It is impossible to have a standard protein corona for a given nanoparticle, as each one will have a different composition [15]. The best approach possible then is to characterize the most occurring proteins, in order to predict the behavior of the nanoparticle when inside the physiological system. This issue of research is still emergent, with promising outcomes to better adjust the nanoparticle to its function and environment. An example of protein corona evaluation is the work presented by Mirshafiee et al. [89], who assessed the differences between nanoparticles with different coatings without a protein corona and the same nanoparticles with it adsorbed. Three different types of nanoparticles were used: the bare nanoparticle (with no coating), a nanoparticle with human serum albumin coating (HSA), and a nanoparticle with gamma-globulin coating (GG). The results indicated that there was a different protein corona associated to each of the various coatings, identifying the proteins by LC-MS/ MS. For instance, a greater number of lipoproteins and a low quantity of complement factors and immunoglobulins were found in HSA-coated nanoparticles, while the opposite occurred in GG-coated nanoparticles, with higher levels of complement factors and opsonins, especially immunoglobulins, and low levels of lipoproteins. The presence of opsonins made the uptake more difficult, and when comparing with nanoparticles without protein corona, the differences in uptake were very significant, as nanoparticles without it entered the cells more easily.",

            "text": "In biological fluids, proteins bind to the surface of nanoparticles to form a biological coating around the nanoparticle, known as the protein corona. Over the time, this corona evolves and may modulate nanoparticle-induced processes such as opsonization which have direct consequences on the mode of interaction with cells, the efficacy of cellular NP uptake and thus, the organ targeting, biodistribution, and circulatio time of NP in vertebrates and non-vertebrates [22]. \n\nOur study indicates that the properties of the NP dictate the extent and specificity of protein binding profiles, which are complex, and in line with other studies may well consist of more than hundred different proteins [22,[27][28][29]. Albeit we did not perform a detailed identification of the protein corona composition by comprehensive proteomic methods, previous studies demonstrated that the coronae indeed contain (patho)biologically relevant proteins [22,[27][28][29]. Such proteins are not only involved in essential processes of the blood system and, thus, may act as opsonins or dysopsonins and modulate blood coagulation, but are also implicated in (cytoprotective) signal transduction pathways [22,28,29,46]. Facing the complexity of the plasma corona, one main challenge is clearly to determine to what extent the nanobiological effects observed are mediated directly by the biological activity of corona proteins, and to dissect the involved molecular mechanism. Additionally, the impact of the formation of a corona on transforming the primary properties of the formulated nanomaterials needs to be investigated. Notably, further studies need to consider also the impact of GI fluids or mucus on the biotransformation of ingested nanomaterials. Albeit these investigations will be challenging, the results of such studies are required to complete out understanding of the fate of nanomaterials in physiologically relevant environments. \n\nIn conclusion, based also on our study it is conceivable to speculate that depending on the type of nanomaterials the presence of proteins will have dual effects: For one, proteins may trigger the formation of a biologically active protein corona.",

            "text": "Magnetic nanoparticles (MNP) are interesting tools for a variety of applications for diagnosis and therapy in medicine [1,2]. Prominent examples are magnetic drug targeting [3,4], magnetic particle hyperthermia [5,6] or magnetic particle imaging [7,8]. For this purpose, aqueous MNP dispersions (ferrofluids) have to be administered to the body, which requires a reliable sterilization of the ferrofluids to exclude any risk for the patient from pathogens within the fluid. Typically, this sterilization is performed by exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation or autoclaving [9]. \n\nWhen injecting MNP into a biological system (e.g., the peripheral blood of a patient), a layer made of different proteins present in the biological system (serving as a protein source) is formed on the surface of the MNP-the so-called protein corona [10,11]. This protein layer of a few nanometers [12] can be divided into a peripheral soft corona and a hard corona on the interface to the particles [13,14]. In our previous investigations [15,16] we could demonstrate that the formation of the corona occurs within seconds and the corona composition is furthermore influenced by the temperature at which corona formation takes place, as well as the duration of particle-protein interaction. It should be recalled here that for most engineered nanoparticles, their dilution in biological fluids (such as peripheral blood or fetal bovine serum) leads to particle aggregation [17][18][19]. It is also known that different particle properties (e.g., size and surface charge) exhibit an influence on protein corona formation and the resulting corona composition [20][21][22]. Furthermore, the protein corona plays a crucial role for the biological fate of the particles within the body [22][23][24]. The protein corona affects the cellular uptake profoundly and has an impact on the cell response, for example, cytotoxicity [25][26][27][28].",

            "text": "Nanoparticles find increasing applications in life science and biomedicine. The fate of nanoparticles in a biological system is determined by their protein corona, as remodeling of their surface properties through protein adsorption triggers specific recognition such as cell uptake and immune system clearance and nonspecific processes such as aggregation and precipitation. The corona is a result of nanoparticle\u2013protein and protein\u2013protein interactions and is influenced by particle design. The state-of-the-art design of biomedical nanoparticles is the core\u2013shell structure exemplified by superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) grafted with dense, well-hydrated polymer shells used for biomedical magnetic imaging and therapy. Densely grafted polymer chains form a polymer brush, yielding a highly repulsive barrier to the formation of a protein corona via nonspecific particle\u2013protein interactions. However, recent studies showed that the abundant blood serum protein albumin interacts with dense polymer brush-grafted SPIONs. Herein, we use isothermal titration calorimetry to characterize the nonspecific interactions between human serum albumin, human serum immunoglobulin G, human transferrin, and hen egg lysozyme with monodisperse poly(2-alkyl-2-oxazoline)-grafted SPIONs with different grafting densities and core sizes. These particles show similar protein interactions despite their different \u201cstealth\u201d capabilities in cell culture. The SPIONs resist attractive interactions with lysozymes and transferrins, but they both show a significant exothermic enthalpic and low exothermic entropic interaction with low stoichiometry for albumin and immunoglobulin G. Our results highlight that protein size, flexibility, and charge are important to predict protein corona formation on polymer brush-stabilized nanoparticles.",

            "text": "It has also been described that zwitterionic nanoparticles lack a protein corona [29]. Nevertheless, corona formation cannot be completely prevented even with the presence of PEG that reduces protein adsorption without lack of cellular uptake [30]. \n\nThe determination of the corona and the comprehension of its dependence on the nanoparticle properties has become of capital importance in nanoscience as can be stated by the large amount of published papers in the last few years. In this aspect, Lundqvist et al. [31] have reported that even for a specific material type, the size of the particle, and its surface modification can completely alter the protein corona and probably their biological impact. Corona proteins can physically mask the nanoparticle surface, potentially affecting the therapeutic effect of the molecules bound to the nanoparticle surface [32]. On another hand, it has also been described that cellular uptake is strongly related to the nature of the proteins that constitute protein corona [33]. For instance, it has been found that albumin pre-loading increased the macrophage uptake of PPEylated(polyphosphoester) nanocarriers while it was decreased when these same nanocarriers where loaded with clusterin. Sch\u00f6ttler et al. [34] have found that, in presence of proteins, PEGylated nanocarriers incubated with 10% of fetal bovine serum were not taken up by HeLa cells in contrast with the high uptake observed in absence of a previous incubation. Not only altered plasma protein composition due to different diseases affects the protein corona but also, the composition of the corona varies among healthy individuals [35]. Thus, the protein source is a crucial factor in the formation of the corona. \n\nThe protein corona-nanoparticle conjunction has raised the interest of many groups regarding not only liposomes but other organic (nanorods, carbon nanotubes) or inorganic particles (superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles, gold nanobones) [36][37][38][39].",

            "text": "24 It is known that different nanoparticle properties such as size, charge, and shape can influence corona composition, and this can lead to different cellular responses to nanomaterials. 8,25,26 The corona composition also varies depending on the nature of the biological fluids in which nanoparticles are dispersed, such as fetal bovine serum, human serum, or plasma, 27 and even in the same fluid, when the ratio between nanoparticle and fluid concentration is changed. 28 It has also been shown that the composition of this layer evolves over time or for instance during nanoparticle exposure to cells, because of adsorption of biomolecules secreted by cells in the medium. 21,22,29,30 Importantly, several studies have highlighted that the corona composition affects nanoparticle\u2212cell association 31 and that corona proteins can engage with specific cell receptors. 10,20,32,33 For instance, it has been shown that the uptake of silica nanoparticles is mediated by the recognition of corona proteins by the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor. 10 However, it is not known yet whether the corona composition and the initial recognition of corona proteins by specific cell receptors also affect the following mechanism cells use to internalize the nanoparticles.\n\nTo this aim, in this work we characterized and compared the mechanisms of uptake of nanoparticles dispersed in media containing two very different serum concentrations, a high serum content close to protein concentration in blood (roughly 60 mg/mL) and a 5 times lower one. Silica nanoparticles (SiO 2 nanoparticles) of 50 nm diameter were used as a representative model system to form different coronas in the two conditions. It is known that varying serum amount can lead to formation of different coronas. 28 Then, the effect of serum content on the uptake efficiency in HeLa cells was investigated, and common pharmacological inhibitors of endocytosis were used in order to determine potential differences in the mechanisms of uptake in the two conditions. Next, RNA interference was used to silence the expression of the LDL receptor, here selected as a first illustrative example, given the previous reports on its involvement in the uptake of similar silica nanoparticles. 10 This allowed",

Two main parameters were considered: the average size (Mean) and the concentration of total particles (LNPs at the initial time, LNPs and serum particles during the incubation). As shown in Figure 3, after incubation in FBS, the particle size distribution profiles (concentration/size curves) were completely different depending on the lipid-PEG included in the LNPs. A flattening and displacement of the curves was observed for the DMG-and DTA-PEG (C14)-based formulations (Figure 3G-J), indicating an increase in the mean size and a decrease in the total particle concentration over time in the presence of FBS. The increase in the mean size was related to the adsorption of proteins around LNPs. On the contrary, the DSPE-and DSG-PEG (C18)-based formulations (Figure 3A-D) did not show any flattening of their curves over time. These formulations were characterized by maintaining a constant average size with no decrease in concentration during incubation.",

When GNPs enter a biological fluid like blood, proteins adsorb on the surface of GNPs, and GNP-protein corona formation occurs depending on the characteristics of both protein (protein corona) and local environment.A significant increase in biomedical applications of nanomaterials and their potential toxicity requires deverse analytical techniques to determine proteinnanoparticle (NP) interactions. Most important tecnhiques for the analysis of binding affinity, binding ratio, and binding mechanisms of NP-protein interaction, are based on spectroscopy. Since NP-protein binding is a dynamic event, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), Fluorescence spectroscopy and other methods are used. Understanding of the effect of NPs on the protein structure is crucial for nanomedicine application. Further studies on the formation and the composition of the protein corona needs to be done, including all the possible consequences that are incurred by the specific proteins.",

            "text": "The most important difficulty in obtaining a successful translation of innovative formulations in clinical practice is the lack of knowledge of their in vivo performance at systemic, tissue, and cellular levels (Tang et al., 2017). This large gap between the design of nanosystems and their effective clinical application is primarily due to the partial understanding of the in vivo fate of nanomaterials. Once systemically administered, nanoparticles are characterized by a significant modulation of their physicochemical characteristics. For this reason, a full characterization of nanosystems is a mandatory step in the preformulation phases of novel nanomaterials in order to improve the outcomes in the development of nanomedicines (Corbo et al., 2016). Upon exposure to biological fluids N of nanoparticles dynamically and often immediately (<0.5 min) interact with biomolecules such as proteins and lipids through a process defined as opsonization when injected into the blood stream, promoting the formation of the so-called \"biocorona\" on their surfaces (Cai and Chen, 2019;Lima et al., 2020). The adsorption of opsonins causes their recognition as non-self compounds, promoting their metabolism and elimination by the MPS, leading to a rapid clearance, low efficiency, and high liver accumulation. Notably, opsonins rapidly identify the positively-charged particles with respect to anionic systems (Neagu et al., 2017). \n\nSeveral types of serum proteins, such as serum albumin, immunoglobulin G, fibrinogen, clustering and apolipoproteins generally present in the biological milieu, can all interact with circulating nanosystems (Lee et al., 2015). It has been reported by several studies that the formation of a protein corona is a dynamic process, induced by the competition of various proteins adsorbed onto the surfaces of nanoparticles and it can be classified as either \"soft\" or \"hard\" as a function of the nature of the compounds and interactions involved. Namely, the hard corona presents the first tightly bound layer of proteins over an extended period (many hours), while the soft corona represents a second layer of protein (not directly bound to the nanosystems) facing rapid exchanges for shorter periods (i.e.",

            "text": "STRATEGIES FOR APPLICATION Though great progress has been made in size-tunable nanoparticles, there are still many challenges that hinder the efficacy, which need to be further optimized and solved. \n\n5.1. Protein Corona May Shield the Responsive Ligand. Protein corona acts as the main issue to affect the targeting efficiency. The corona is quickly formed once nanoparticles are introduced into biological fluid. As we have discussed previously, the composition, size, shape, and surface chemistry of nanoparticles, and even the different fluid environment in vivo, influence the formation of protein corona. 152 In addition to acting as opsonin to mark a nanodrug and alter its biodistribution, the adsorbed protein corona on the surface may also shield the responsive ligand from stimuli and affect the sensitivity of size changing. Among which, the mechanism that need direct contact such as enzymatic reaction, pH-induced protonation and GSH-dependent redox may suffer from the protein corona a lot, while the external stimuli such as light and temperature would not be bothered. Though PEGylation has been confirmed to facilitate nanoparticles with the \"stealth\" property, which can reduce the protein adsorption and decrease the effect of corona, there comes a new question whether the enzymatic reaction would also be affected by PEGylation, as the nature of enzyme is protein as well. The response sensitivity may be affected in the enzyme-induced size change after PEGylation. \n\n5.2. Accuracy of Measurement. As we are doing research studies about size changing, the detection of nanoparticles' size undoubtably requires very high accuracy. However, the size measured by DLS always displays a relatively wide peak. 153 anoparticles with an average DLS size of 100 nm probably have a peak ranging from 50 to 400 nm. It is not that convincing to confirm the success of size shrinkage (from 100 to 50 nm) or size aggregation (from 100 to 400 nm) as there is an overlap of size during the size change process. The corresponding distribution intervals can be compared separately instead of just comparing the average number, which is meaningless.",

            "text": "The surface chemistry of nanoparticles (NPs) plays a fundamental role on their interaction with biomolecules and their fate in biological matrixes. The engineering of the NP surface is the usual strategy followed to control cellular uptake and trafficking of NPs and to confer the NPs with specific recognition properties [1][2][3] . A key aspect in the interaction of NPs with biological fluids and their biological fate is the formation of the so-called protein corona (PC) 4 . The corona results from the association of proteins to the NPs, forming a coating that shields the NP surface. The PC composition, the size and the degree of coverage of the NP surface have been shown to depend on the surface chemistry of the NPs 5 . PC formation on NPs is basically an universal phenomena for NPs dispersed in biological fluids and it is even observed in NPs with a stealth coating, i.e. modified with molecules like polyethylene glycol or sugars that result in a limited interaction with proteins 6,7 . PC is the ultimate interface with the biological environment and plays a crucial role in cell-NPs interactions. Cell uptake, cytotoxicity and intracellular trafficking have been widely reported to be affected by changes in PC composition or stability [8][9][10][11] . In a recent work, we have shown that the intracellular aggregation of NPs correlates to the antifouling character of the coating 12 . Modulating the PC composition through changes in the chemistry of the NP surface seems to be a promising strategy to guide the in vivo behavior of NPs as the presence of certain proteins on their surface can direct NPs towards specific intracellular pathways 13,14 . \n\nHowever, little is known about the intracellular fate of the protein corona around NPs. Studies in vitro have shown that the PC is a dynamic entity 11,15,16 . The hard corona, the closest layer of proteins to NPs surface, is formed by the proteins that have the highest affinity for the NPs and exchange slowly with the surrounding media. On top of the hard corona, there are proteins weakly associated with the NPs that are easily exchanged; these are named as soft corona.",

A key aspect in the interaction of NPs with biological fluids and their biological fate is the formation of the so-called protein corona (PC) 4 . The corona results from the association of proteins to the NPs, forming a coating that shields the NP surface. The PC composition, the size and the degree of coverage of the NP surface have been shown to depend on the surface chemistry of the NPs 5 . PC formation on NPs is basically an universal phenomena for NPs dispersed in biological fluids and it is even observed in NPs with a stealth coating, i.e. modified with molecules like polyethylene glycol or sugars that result in a limited interaction with proteins 6,7 . PC is the ultimate interface with the biological environment and plays a crucial role in cell-NPs interactions. Cell uptake, cytotoxicity and intracellular trafficking have been widely reported to be affected by changes in PC composition or stability [8][9][10][11] . In a recent work, we have shown that the intracellular aggregation of NPs correlates to the antifouling character of the coating 12 . Modulating the PC composition through changes in the chemistry of the NP surface seems to be a promising strategy to guide the in vivo behavior of NPs as the presence of certain proteins on their surface can direct NPs towards specific intracellular pathways 13,14 . \n\nHowever, little is known about the intracellular fate of the protein corona around NPs. Studies in vitro have shown that the PC is a dynamic entity 11,15,16 . The hard corona, the closest layer of proteins to NPs surface, is formed by the proteins that have the highest affinity for the NPs and exchange slowly with the surrounding media. On top of the hard corona, there are proteins weakly associated with the NPs that are easily exchanged; these are named as soft corona.",

Expanding the circulation time of the nanoparticles means more contact with the blood proteins, a higher probability of thrombogenicity, and the activation of the complement system [92]. Since the corona depends on the characteristics of the nanoparticle (chemical surface, size, shape, and charge), these properties could be adjusted in such a way for the proteins that make it up to mitigate the immune response. Tuning the properties of affinity toward the corona could optimize the biocompatibility of the nanoparticles and reduce their toxicity. However, this process is not easy, and few researchers designing nanomaterials take corona formation into consideration. Ideally, nanoparticle development should encompass studies that provide data regarding nanoparticle-protein interactions, as is customary during the development of a new drug. There are few reports on this subject, and limited knowledge in this field may be a reason for the lack of successful clinical treatments.",

The apolipoprotein classes and quantities were also varied among PEC protein coronas. Previous studies demonstrated that the interplay of different parameters including nanoparticle surface chemistry, incubation condition, and serum protein physicochemical properties such as protein Mw, size, electrostatic charge, and chemical composition dictate the protein corona identity 48 . The interaction of proteins with nanoparticles occurs by covalent and non-covalent bonds. Herein, the studied PECs have negative zeta potential due to the neutralizing of Ch in serum condition with pH >6.5 and negative charge of dextran. Hemoglobin possesses the positive charge in serum condition and was adsorbed to the negative charge PECs. Furthermore it could be attached to the thiolated PECs via disulfide bonds between cysteine residues 46 . Apo-lipoproteins which are amphipathic molecules could also absorb on PECs. They are small proteins with negative charge in serum and bind to the lipid particles. Saha et al. demonstrated that levels of lipoproteins in protein corona depends on chemistry of nanoparticle surface as it decreased on functionalized gold nanoparticles in 10% FBS medium following increasing the hydrophobicity of nanoparticle surface 41 . Protein C which is a glycoprotein also dominantly covered the PECs. The surface of particles consists of large number of carboxyl, amine, hydroxyl and thiol (in case of using TD in PEC structure) groups that involve in interactions with protein functional moieties. Although albumin has the most percentage in serum, we assume that the mentioned proteins have more affinity to the PEC functional groups. \n\nMoreover, the interaction of the specific proteins can affect the biodistribution, clearance, and uptake of the nanoparticles by macrophages and target cells 49,50 .",

Under physiologic conditions, the corona may alter the NP properties by masking its surface characteristics [9,10]. e exposure time in the blood circulation has been recognized as a key factor that shapes the NP biomolecular corona; furthermore, the new properties that are imparted to the NPs by the corona are the main factor that controls the distribution, nanotoxicity, and the therapeutic effect of NPs in the body [11] (Figure 2). Some studies have suggested that the formation of the protein corona is an undesirable process; however, others have discussed the advantages of this formation, such as reducing the cytotoxic effect, eliminating undesirable interactions with the immune system, and facilitating cellular internalization [12]. e protein corona might reduce the targeting capability of the NPs by shielding the recognition site of the targeting ligands from the receptors [13]. Different disease types can have different effects on the corona composition, because for every disease, there are different types of proteins secreted in the body, and these proteins may affect the corona composition around the NPs [14]. ese considerations mean that patients with different types of cancer may have specific types of coronas [14]. is has led some authors to introduce a new concept for NP targeting called a \"personalized protein corona\" (PPC) [15], wherein precise information on corona composition is a must to produce optimum personalized nanomedicines for therapy and diagnosis of every type of cancer. Colapicchioni et al. [16] investigated whether the pathological alteration of plasma proteins influenced the protein corona. ey incubated liposomes with the plasma taken from patients with confirmed breast, pancreatic, and gastric cancer. e NPs were then isolated by centrifugation, and they found that the hard corona varied",

Actually, it has been shown that PEGylated surfaces acquire the ability to reduce clearance by immune cells thanks to the adsorption of specific proteins in their corona. 20 iven the many effects of the protein corona on the interactions of nanoparticles with cells, understanding which corona components and cellular receptors can affect the biological fate of nanoparticles is important for improving the design of nanocarriers. \u221213 This opens up new ways for the improvement of nanocarrier targeting by exploiting interactions mediated by their corona, as for instance, it was demonstrated for approved nanomedicines currently in the clinic. 21 \u221225 Thus, nanoparticles may be tailored to adsorb specific biomolecules in their corona and, in this way, be directed to specific cell receptors. 16,17 \u221228 Similarly, by correlating the composition of the corona formed on different nanoparticles and their cell uptake efficiency, corona proteins that can promote or reduce uptake by cells have been identified. 28,29 For instance, a previous study in which this approach was applied discovered that apolipoproteins (ApoH, ApoA4, and ApoC3) were responsible for regulating nanoparticle uptake in human mesenchymal stem cells. 29 ince different cell types may have different interactions with the protein corona, by comparing the association in multiple target cells new strategies for targeting specific cells may be discovered.",

            "text": "Fifteen years have elapsed since the term \"protein corona\" was introduced by Dawson, Linse, and their colleagues [1]. While the adsorption of proteins onto surfaces, such as particles, scaffolds, or implants, has been recognized for quite some time, its true significance in bio-nano research had not been thoroughly examined until the publication of the report. The concept of the protein corona can be likened to the halo of plasma surrounding the sun, where proteins in a solution containing serum form a coating around tiny particles. This analogy draws a parallel between the glowing halo surrounding the sun and the protein coats enveloping particles in serum-containing environments [2]. Recent discoveries have revealed that the formation of a protein corona is driven by thermodynamic reactions in water-based environments, with the goal of minimizing free enthalpy. The process is influenced by underlying physics. Throughout history, substantial efforts have been devoted to understanding the nature and properties of protein coronas, employing a diverse range of models and methods from the fields of chemistry, biology, and material sciences [3]. The exploration of protein coronas holds tremendous potential for diverse biomedical and nanotechnological applications, as it profoundly influences the behavior and interactions of nanoparticles within biological systems. By delving deeper into the complexities of protein corona formation, we can pave the way for more effective and targeted applications in medicine and beyond. In the biomedical domain, nanotechnology plays a crucial role in the development of materials for screening, smart delivery, and medication administration, driving extensive research in this area. When a nanoparticle is introduced into a complex biomedium, it undergoes the Vroman effect, where it initially acquires a temporary or \"soft\" corona composed of large-sized molecules that are present in high concentrations. Subsequently, the nanoparticle becomes enveloped in a \"hard\" corona, formed by molecules with a stronger affinity [4]. Figure 1 illustrates this phenomenon conceptually [5]. During protein binding, the enthalpy is lowered, and the nanoparticle's coat undergoes changes, increasing entropy. These interactions have diverse outcomes, including enhanced bioavailability and dispersion of particles in serumcontaining media.",

            "text": "In recent times, novel opportunities have emerged in the realm of bionano interactions, presenting new avenues for the development of targeted NPs. These interactions result in the encapsulation of NPs by biomolecules, leading to the formation of a biomolecular corona, commonly known as the protein corona, due to its predominant enrichment with plasma proteins. Initially, it was observed that the presence of a protein corona on NPs hinders the effectiveness of targeting ligands, 23 thereby impairing the NP's targeting ability. However, it was later recognized that complete avoidance of protein corona formation, even in PEGylated systems, is not feasible. 24 Consequently, efforts were redirected toward harnessing the protein corona as an inherent targeting moiety, as the proteins acquired from the bloodstream could potentially serve as targeting ligands. 25 ur research group has successfully provided direct evidence of targeted delivery of NPs by coating a cationic liposome with a protein corona enriched in vitronectin. 26 This plasma protein bestowed the liposome with the remarkable ability to selectively target and bind to cancer cells that exhibit an elevated level of expression of the vitronectin receptor. A recent scientific hypothesis has suggested that the high liver tropism and transfection potency exhibited by Onpattro may be attributed to the formation of a protein corona enriched with Apo-E. 2 This protein corona, in turn, enables the recognition of hepatocytes through the LDL receptor, potentially contributing to its liver-targeting capabilities. \n\nIn the context of vaccination, the translation of LNP vaccines into clinical practice faces challenges due to our limited understanding of their protein corona, which may influence the tissue accumulation of particles in physiological environments. Upon ID, LNP vaccines are exposed to the dermal interstitial fluid (DIF) 27 leading to the formation of a protein corona. Given that the protein source is a key determinant in shaping the composition of the protein corona, 28 we assert that conducting a thorough investigation of LNPs in the DIF is an essential and decisive step in advancing our comprehension of their mechanism of action upon intradermal injection.",

For more detailed information, reviews that are more extensive are highlighted in the beginning of the respective chapter. reviews addressing and focusing on the protein adsorption onto nanoparticles, [6][7][8] and the impact of the protein corona on nanomedicine 2 are available in the literature.\n\nThe process of protein corona formation is a competition between different proteins for interactions with the accessible surface of NPs. Result of this competition is a dynamic 'cloud' of proteins around the NPs, which continuously changes over time. In the beginning seconds to minutes of this interaction, the more abundant blood proteins such as albumin will be dominant in the corona. 9 Over time, proteins with higher affinity (and lower concentration) will take over the space close to the NP's surface and proteins with lower affinity will be attached more loosely in the outer layers around the NP. 9 This kinetically driven evolution of the corona over time is commonly referred to as 'Vroman-effect'. 10 Common nomenclature for the more tightly bound proteins is the so called 'hard' protein corona, while loosely bound proteins are considered 'soft' corona proteins. 11 Properties of proteins and nanoparticles alike influence their intermolecular interactions with each other. NPs' properties of interest include size, 12 surface charge and functionalization, 11 stabilizing surfactants, 13 and hydrophilicity. 14 On the other hand, the proteins' properties of interest address their amphiphilic character, which leads to screening of hydrophobic parts of the protein from the surrounding water. 15 Similarly, smaller hydrophobic molecules can be transported by amphiphilic proteins such as lipids attached to apolipoproteins. 16 This amphiphilic nature in turn also leads to preferred interaction with other surfaces such as nanomaterials. The main forces governing the interfacial interactions between nanomaterials and biological systems are listed in Fig. 1 and in Table 1. 8 Remaining questions in the field include (but are not limited to) the possibility of protein-multilayers in the corona, 17,18 the exact mechanism of the Vroman effect with influence of kinetics on the protein corona, 10,19,20 and",

            "text": "On its journey through the bloodstream, individual PTs will interact with a wide range of factors, leading to the formation of an adsorbed protein layer known as the protein corona [46,47] and opsonization, which can lead to enhanced PT clearance from the bloodstream, altered targeting (both inhibition and promotion) and the induction of toxicity [47]. Coronal factors include albumin, immunoglobulin G (IgG), transferrin, fibrinogen and apolipoproteins, while antibodies, complement proteins and circulating proteins such as pentraxins, collectins and ficolins can all act as opsonizing agents. For a wider aspect on the importance of the protein corona to nanomedicine, we direct the reader to a recent excellent review [48]. \n\nThe formation of the protein corona not only depends on the type of polymer used [49,50] but also the specific physiological environments encountered [51], the duration of exposure [52,53] and also on the state of the patient being treated [54]. The latter study demonstrated that while protein corona formation on various nanomedicines displayed similarities between control and breast cancer patients, blood cancer patients and smokers demonstrated differing protein corona patterns in comparison to healthy controls [54]. Furthermore, genetic background, sex, life-style and race also strongly influence plasma protein levels in healthy individuals [55,56], which all contribute to patient-specific corona formation. \n\nAs mentioned, the formation of the protein corona on PT formulations can significantly affect PT targeting and, therefore overall efficiency. Meister et al. discovered that polylactide (PLA) nanoparticles containing the A\u03b242 lowering drug flurbiprofen (as a potential therapy for Alzheimer's disease (AD)) became quickly decorated with bioactive proteins, including apolipoprotein E, which actually aided the passage of the nanoparticle through the blood-brain-barrier [57]. Furthermore, a study by Papi et al. discovered that protein corona formation also increased cellular uptake of PEGylated liposomal irinotecan in the pancreas ductal adenocarcinoma cell line (PANC-1) [58].",

Recently, multifunctional iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles have shown great success in biomarker detection, proteomic trails, and other biomedical applications. The iron oxide NPs form the protein corona due to higher compatibility with unique and specific oncogenic biomarkers. 28 Different sets of trials using green synthesized iron oxide NPs and various modification exhibited phenomenon results in biomarker detection and theragnostic. 29,30 Many researchers investigated the protein corona around nanoparticles for efficient detection of diseases at a very early stage for their proper treatment. 31,32 Previously, researchers found interesting results after incubating nanoparticles in various nutrient media for determination of their composition in the hard and soft corona. 33 In other studies, proteomics analysis of human serum was carried out after interaction of serum with silver, gold, and platinum nanoparticles to explore how the types of nanoparticles change the nature of protein interaction. 28,34 However, there is no documentation of data regarding the surface coating of natural biomolecules on the surface of nanoparticles for interaction and harvesting key and unique biomarkers. Interestingly, we aim to synthesize iron oxide NPs using the Withania coagulans extract that yields rod-shaped nanoparticles, detected through high-resolution microscopy analysis. In the next round, the green synthesized iron oxide NPs were treated with nine different cancerous serums (brain, breast, liver, muscles, neck, ovary, rectum, stomach, and testicular cancer) that were also examined under the microscopy technique for the conformation of the protein corona, where the most abundant carcinoma-treated particles were investigated through proteomics analysis techniques. Resultantly, the set of extracted oncogenic proteins were obtained and classified as common and differential proteins that were extracted using iron oxide NPs and serum-treated iron oxide NPs. This provided a pool of biomarkers that directly and indirectly triggered oncogenic pathways.",

There were no significant differences in the surface charges after corona formation of the various nanoparticles, which was also reported in the literature. 41 In order to understand the reason for the inhibited cellular uptake of protein-coated NCs, the composition of protein corona was further analyzed. The corona pre-formed SiNCs were centrifuged to remove the loosely bound proteins, which comprise the \"soft corona\". The proteins adsorbed on SiNC surfaces were desorbed and subsequently separated by SDS-PAGE ( Figure 5A). The silver-stained gel revealed different \"hard corona\" patterns for the 7 different SiNCs. Some small proteins in the size of 6-16 kDa were only found in the corona of NC(i)-LUT with and without NH 2 -functionalization. These results indicate that the physicochemical properties of the NCs had a strong effect on corona composition. Furthermore, the total protein amount adsorbed per m 2 SiNC was calculated ( Figure 5B). The NC(o) had a higher amount of protein adsorbed on the surface compared to NC(i). In our previous work we showed by NMR that the oil-water exchange results in further hydrolysis of the alkoxysilanes. 42 Therefore, this process has an influence on the silica network. Based on this, we assume that NC(i) are more hydrophilic compared to NC(o), which affects the adsorption of blood proteins. In literature, it was shown that a hydrophobic surface of nanoparticles also results in an increased adsorption of proteins compared to a hydrophilic surface. 42 Among the hydrophilic core, NC(i)-CTAC had the highest amount of protein adsorbed. It can be observed that the protein amount was decreased with increasing NH 2 -functionalization.\n\nIn \"hard corona\", proteins were analyzed by LC-MS. Proteins involved in the coagulation cascade (e.g. histidinerich glycoprotein, kininogen, plasminogen, and vitronectin) were the dominant protein group for all SiNCs ( Figure 5C and D",

            "text": "The first principle of nanoparticle delivery to tumors posits that nanoparticles will interact with biomolecules, including proteins, lipids, and ions, after in vivo administration. Nanoparticles may also stick to cells in circulation. The most well-studied nanoparticle interactions are with serum proteins. A protein corona is called the layer of serum proteins that coats the nanoparticle surface [10,11]. We also use the term biological identity to describe the overall physicochemical properties of nanoparticles in biological media because there may be additional changes in the nanoparticle properties than the surfaceadsorbed proteins [12]. For example, the nanoparticle may agglomerate into multimers. A cell sees the protein corona and unique particle morphology. \n\nNanoparticles instantaneously adsorb serum proteins after intravenous administration to form a protein corona. The corona composition can change when they travel in the bloodstream until the proteins reach an exchange equilibrium on the nanoparticle surface [13,14]. Researchers theorize that the bound serum proteins mediate the nanoparticles' cellular interactions as they travel through the bloodstream. Chithrani et al. [15] provided the first reported impact of serum protein adsorption on nanoparticles and cellular uptake. They proposed that serum proteins would affect the size-dependent uptake of gold nanoparticles in cultured HeLa cells. They showed the serum protein presence on the nanoparticles by showing a shift in the agarose gel bands of nanoparticles incubated with and without serum. Cedervall et al. [16,17] used polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to show that polystyrene nanoparticles bound many different serum proteins. They coined the term protein corona to describe the adsorbed proteins. They further described the corona as being hard or soft, referring to the strength of the nanoparticle-protein interaction. A hard corona usually has strong interactions between the nanoparticle and serum proteins, while a soft corona refers to nanoparticles that can readily adsorb and desorb from the surface. A soft corona can be called a transient protein corona.",

            "text": "In recent years, significant efforts have been drawn focusing on designing nanoenabled drug delivery and biocompatible therapeutically active agents. These systems offer many advantages in drug delivery, such as improved efficacy, biosafety, and stability of the drugs. (Hamidi et al., 2008;Mudshinge et al., 2011;Singh and Lillard, 2012;Balcells et al., 2019). However, all these advances are still far to be translated into clinic. Many factors account for this drawback. However, one of the main issues is the interaction of the nanoparticles (NPs) with the biological medium. When NPs enter the blood stream, they immediately adsorb proteins on their surface. (Lynch and Dawson, 2008;Gao and He, 2014). This coating on the NP's surface is known as the protein corona (PC). Depending on the affinity of the protein absorbed, this coating is known as the \"hard\" corona when the affinity is high and the proteins are tightly bound or \"soft\" corona consisting of loosely bound proteins, probably interacting with hard corona proteins. The nature of the PC determines the biological fate of the nanoparticle, such as cellular uptake, circulation time, bioavailability, and even toxicity, and it is crucial to achieve the goal as a drug delivery system. (Ferrari, 2005;Castillo et al., 2013). In this sense, recently, the importance of the PC in the biodistribution (Sarparanta et al., 2012) or targetability of the mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN) (Rosenholm et al., 2010) as well as the biocompatibility (Tang et al., 2012), among other effects has been shown. Hence, a precise understanding of the parameters that govern the PC formation is of critical importance for the design of efficient nanovehicles for drug delivery. (Hadjidemetriou et al., 2015;An and Zhang, 2017). \n\nThe structure of PC is determined by the kinetic and equilibrium binding of protein with a nanoparticle, which depends on the medium composition and on the nanoparticles' properties, such as size, surface charge, surface composition, and functionality.",

            "text": "Nanoparticles have shown great promise in the treatment of cancer and as synthetic nano-vaccines. However, these systems face issues concerning stability under physiological conditions, protein corona formation, and accumulation in the target tissue. One of the biggest limitations for nanoparticle-based therapies is the formation of a protein corona (PC) on the nanoparticle surface and its effect on their biological performance. Therefore, it is fundamental to include systematic studies on NP-PC complexes and to define the biological identity of the final nano-formulation in the field of nano-therapy [107,108]. These studies will be useful in order to predict the physicochemical changes, such as protein absorption, of the NPs that could affect NP-based immunotherapies causing \"immune blinding\" or immune reactivity. \n\nEven though protein adsorption and PC formation appear to be two of the biggest limitations for nanoparticle-based therapies, there is a possibility to revert this situation to a positive scenario. This is the case of the personalized protein corona (PPC) [109][110][111]. Recently, it has been shown that the protein corona is strongly affected for example by specific diseases in patients from which the plasma is obtained. Therefore, the same nanomaterial incubated with plasma proteins from patients with different pathologies generates protein coronas with different compositions, giving rise to the concept of personalized protein corona [109]. In recent years, the PPC has become a very interesting approach to screen protein biomarkers in plasma for early diagnosis and treatment of different diseases [102,112]. Specially, the PPC could be revolutionary in the field of cancer immunotherapy. In this sense, one of the best examples of NP-PPC based cancer immunotherapy was designed taking into account a key clinical approach to improve cancer immunotherapy: the combination of radiotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors.",

            "text": "Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have been broadly applied to various biomedical fields such as biosensing assays and clinical diagnoses, due to the unique physicochemical properties and biocompatibility which are distinctly different from those of their bulk counterparts at the nano-scale. Today, AuNPs are emerging as promising therapeutic agents for treatment of AIDS [1], tumor [2,3], and Parkinson's disease [4] and are being developed as a new form of drug carriers based on their own bioactivity, photo-thermal effect, and high drug-load capacity and membrane permeability. Additionally, more and more nanogold-containing products become readily available on the market, thus increasing the chance of exposure to and the health risks of engineered nanogold in food, cosmetics, and other consumer products through the skin, lungs, or gastrointestinal tract. As ultrasmall nanoparticles enter a biological system, their impact on and binding with biological components, especially tissue proteins are inevitable in both in vitro and in vivo biological exposure. It is now well established that, in biological fluids such as blood, the surface of nanoparticles becomes coated with a complex mixture of proteins to form the so-called 'protein corona, ' which affects the NP-protein interactions and eventually determines their fate in the body. Extensive studies have been carried out on the NP-induced protein corona phenomenon, and the intrinsic characteristic of NPs (e.g., chemical composition, heterogeneity, size, shape and surface charge, curvature and functionalization) and the complex non-covalent forces occurring at the nano-bio interface (e.g., hydrogen bond, hydrophobic, electrostatic, Van der Waals, steric force, solvent and polymer bridging) are generally considered as the main factors controlling the surface adsorption and interactions [5,6]. However, Dominguez-Medina et al. hold an opposite view that formation of a protein layer is almost independent of NP shape [7] and ionic strength of a solution is an essential element in the formation of bovine serum albumin (BSA)corona with NPs [8]. More recently, some corona proteins in serum have been determined by using quantitative proteomics analysis, but the adsorption",

We offer a direct demonstration of how protein corona can dramatically change the interaction mode between NPs and lipid bilayers. To this end, we choose the most extreme case of NP surface modification: nanostructures in the form of rigid spikes of 10-20 nm length at the surface of gold nanoparticles. In the absence of proteins we observe the formation of reversible pores when spiky NPs absorb on lipid bilayers. In contrast, the presence of bovine serum albumin (BSA) proteins adsorbed at the surface of spiked NPs, effectively reduce the length of spikes exposed to the interaction with lipid bilayers. Thus, protein corona changes qualitatively the dynamics of pore formation, which is completely suppressed at high protein concentrations. These results suggest that protein corona can not only be critical for interaction of NPs with membranes, it may change their mode of interaction, thus offsetting the role of surface chemistry and ligands.",

            "text": "LNPs possess high free energy due to their small size and large surface area, which promotes their interactions with biological macromolecules in biological fluids. Upon entering systemic circulation, NPs acquire a protein corona (PC), a layer of adsorbed proteins that alters their biological identity [121]. Protein adsorption on LNPs depends on both the surface charge and the type of coating used. Studies have shown that high surface charge density increases protein adsorption, while specific coatings, such as Poloxamers, can enhance selective protein adsorption [122] and facilitate the BBB uptake process [123]. Conversely, proteins from the complement system, known as opsonins, mark LNPs for recognition by the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS), thereby accelerating their clearance and reducing their systemic circulation time [124]. \n\nTo avoid rapid opsonization and MPS clearance, stealth NPs have been developed using PEG coatings, which delay PC formation and extend NP half-life in circulation. However, PEGylation has limitations, such as anti-PEG antibody production and reduced cellular internalization. Alternative strategies, including stimuli-responsive PEG derivatives, have been explored to address these challenges [125]. Other strategies have also been proposed to reduce or avoid PC formation, such as coating NPs with substances like glutathione or functionalizing their surfaces with polymers to minimize non-specific interactions [126]. Synthetic polymer conjugates, like amphiphilic N-(2-hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide (HPMA) copolymer, can provide NPs with an \"invisibility cloak\" against serum proteins [127]. Recent advancements suggest that using cell membrane fragments as nanoparticle surface coatings can enhance their circulation time and targeting capability [128]. These hybrid nanomaterials combine the properties of biological cell membranes with those of synthetic nanoparticles [129]. This approach provides immune camouflage, reduces leukocyte uptake, and offers the potential to target non-immune cells like astrocytes and neurons. Membrane-coated nanoparticles and cell membrane-derived nanovesicles are emerging strategies for novel diagnostic and therapeutic applications across various diseases.",

            "text": "Typically, the characteristics of CPP-nucleic acid nanoparticles like size, zeta potential and morphology are analysed in media used for assembly of particles, e.g., in diluted buffer solution or water (Table 2) [49,50,52,61]. Therefore, next we attempted visualisation of protein corona on CPP-nucleic acid nanoparticles to assess, whether the morphology or aggregation of particles could change upon contact with biologically relevant environment that has been demonstrated earlier for other types of nanoparticles [51,62]. We associated PF14 with biotin-labelled SCO and tagged the formed complexes with 10 nm gold particles via neutravidin (black dots in Figure 2) [63] for facilitating detection by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In water, mostly single nanoparticles of characteristic shape [49] formed and some had gathered to small clusters as verified by TEM in specimens with negative staining with uranyl acetate (Figure 2a). Analogously, in unstained specimen of PF14-SCO nanoparticles, the gold label was randomly distributed, and due to low electron density, the localisation of nanoparticles can only be assigned based on localisation of the gold label ( Figure 2b). However, after incubation with serum, single or slightly clustered PF14-SCO nanoparticles had formed conglomerates with size of several hundred nanometres. Furthermore, the adsorbed proteins had increased the electron density of clusters to level detectable by TEM even in unstained specimens (Figure 2d-f), corroborating formation of extensive protein corona. Still, the electron density of adsorbed proteins was not sufficient for analysing the actual or detailed morphology of protein corona formed around nanoparticles. The shape of conglomerates induced by the formation of protein corona resembled rather a cloud of loosely associated proteins than a regular layer with uniform thickness as was also observed earlier for other nanoparticles [33].\n\nUnfortunately, negative staining that might resolve the morphology of protein corona on nanoparticles, produced abundant artefactual structures with serum proteins that interfered with the visualisation of protein corona as has been reported earlier [64].

Here, the corona may have an important role as plasma proteins have been shown to block ligands attached to the nanoparticle surface or compete with the interaction between ligands and cell receptors [20][21][22]. Dell'Orco et al. have previously modelled targeted delivery in the presence of an exchanging corona, to identify factors that are important for successful targeting [20,21,23]. The size of the bound proteins and their binding affinity for the particle surface were identified as very important. However, the particle size was found to be even more crutial. In the current work, this feature is addressed in experiments and confirmed to be important. \n\nTo the best of our knowledge, all studies characterizing the protein corona are performed in serum or plasma stabilized with different agents. In this work we investigate the corona composition as a function of the source of the plasma proteins, i.e. dependent on the treatment of blood after withdrawal. Blood can, after withdrawal, be treated in different ways to generate different liquids, conventionally named as: whole blood, whole blood with EDTA or Citrate, blood plasma or blood serum. We find that the protein corona composition differ between these four different biological fluids. As the protein corona is important for target delivery, this will have implications for the in vitro evaluation of a target-specific nanoparticle system. \n\nWe also show that the ratio between particle surface area and biological macromolecules in a sample affect the composition of the corona. \n\nKnowledge about composition and dynamics of protein coronas is vital for the development of successful future nanoparticle-based medical applications. However, our current methods to analyze the corona may not be the optimal ones. In this paper, the limitations of the current methods are highlighted and the research fields is encouraged to find new suitable methods.",

In addition, cationic nanoparticles are cleared from circulation much faster than neutral or anionic counterparts [46]. Thus, one of the potential obstacles for cellular uptake of CPP-nucleic acid nanoparticles in vivo might be their inefficient association with cells due to the formation of protein corona on the surface of particles after introduction into physiological environment [47].\n\nCondensation of differently sized nucleic acid molecules to nanoparticles using various cell-penetrating peptides has been well documented [48][49][50][51]. Although the properties of such nanoparticles might significantly change after formation of protein corona on its surface, the composition of protein corona and its impact have not been studied so far. Only the increase of the nanoparticle's size in the presence of serum [48,50,[52][53][54] and the decrease in protein quantity associating with particle upon reducing CPP/nucleic acid molar ratio have been reported [55].\n\nIn this study, we characterised the composition and effect of the protein corona that formed on the surface of CPP-nucleic acid nanoparticles. Analysed particles contained plasmid DNA (pDNA) or splice-correcting oligonucleotide (SCO) that were non-covalently complexed with three CPPs: PepFect 14 (PF14), PF14 modified with a 22-carbon fatty acid tail (C22-PF14) [56] or NickFect 55 (NF55) [57]. We studied the formation of protein corona on different nanoparticles in bovine serum as a representative of cell culture systems, in murine serum as a typical animal model used in the development and testing of such nanoparticles, and in human serum as a representative of the actual target for drug development (Scheme 1). We observed that dissimilar protein corona forming in different sera translates to unequal uptake of studied nanoparticles by cultured cells and varying biological response to nucleic acid cargo. Our results emphasize that, as expected, the features of protein corona on CPP-nuclei",

            "text": "Targeted drug delivery using nanoparticles can minimize the side effects of conventional pharmaceutical antibacterial agents and increase their effectiveness. However, the introduction of nanoparticle-based antibacterial agents into clinical use still remains a challenge, due to difficulties in regulating interactions at interfaces between nanoparticles and biological systems [124]. \n\nWhen creating antibacterial nanosystems and nanocomposites, it is necessary to take into account that nanomaterials in biological media interact with all occurring biomolecules and form a protein \"biocorona\". The biocorona is a very dynamic structure, and its composition changes over time. Biocorona generation affects the effectiveness of the nanopreparation, the \"accuracy\" of targeted delivery, and it also directs the actions of innate and adaptive immunity. Understanding the process of corona formation is critical to predicting the behavior of NPs in biological systems, including nanotoxicology applications and the development of drug delivery platforms at the nanoscale. \n\nThe formation of a protein crown should depend on the physical and chemical characteristics of both NPs and their biological environment [125]. \"Corona\" formation can be influenced by the nanoparticles used by varying such factors as their constituent components, size, presence of functional groups, coatings, charge, hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity, etc. [126,127]. \n\nFor unwanted protein uptake, mechanisms can be introduced to prevent or control the composition of the protein corona. One of these mechanisms is to give the NP surface certain functions by including various chemical groups that \"hide\" it from the \"view\" of immune cells [128]. A second similar mechanism would be the coating of the NP surface with polymers such as polyethylene glycol (PEGylation), in order to prevent recognition of the NP by the reticuloendothelial system. \n\nHowever, the protein crown should not always be seen as an artifact to be avoided. In the case of carbohydrate-decorated amphiphilic nanoparticles, a protein crown is formed in the biological environment based mainly on human serum albumin, complement proteins, apolipoproteins, and proteins involved in the coagulation cascade.",

Here, the authors track the protein corona and nanoparticles in cells and describe the separation and different processing within different cellular compartments. The formation of the protein corona is a well-known effect when nanoparticles (NP) are exposed to biological environments. The protein corona is the most important factor, which determines the rate and route of endocytosis, and decisively impacts cellular processes and even the release of the active pharmaceutical ingredient from the nanoparticles. While many studies concentrate on the effect of the protein corona formation extracellularly or the uptake consequences, little is known about the fate of the protein corona inside of cells. Here, we reconstruct for the first time the separation of the protein corona from the NPs by the cell and their further fate. Ultimately, the NPs and protein corona are separated from each other and end up in morphologically different cellular compartments. The cell directs the NPs towards recycling endosomes, whereas the protein corona gathers in multivesicular bodies. From this, we conclude that the NPs are prepared for subsequent exocytosis, while the protein corona remains in the cell and is finally metabolized there.",

            "text": "The formation of the protein corona significantly alters the surface characteristics of nanoparticles, thus greatly affecting their interactions with organs and cells. In a recent study, Le ND et al. synthesized a series of poly(\u03b2-amino ester) (PBAE) derivatives and found that the protein corona on nanoparticles could help achieve organ targeting (lungs and spleen) [32]. Interestingly, their findings correlated closely with the study of Min Qiu et al. [33] , which demonstrated that the protein corona on lung-targeted nanoparticles had distinct characteristics that promoted lung accumulation. The protein corona formed on the surface of liposomes is primarily influenced by the physicochemical properties of the liposomes themselves. By selecting different lipid components or varying their ratios, it is possible to achieve targeting of different organs or cells. In 2020, Daniel Siegwart et al. reported a Selective Organ Targeting (SORT) delivery technology [34]. They introduced the cationic lipid DOTAP as a fifth component to the formulation 5A2-SC8/DOPE/DMG-PEG2000/Cholesterol, thereby altering the physicochemical properties of the LNPs, including their zeta potential. This modification influenced the formation of the protein corona during blood circulation, enabling intravenous delivery of mRNA to the lungs. Recently, Daniel Siegwart's team reporting the use of Lung SORT LNPs for delivering ABE mRNA/sgRNA to perform gene editing on lung stem cells, treating pulmonary cystic fibrosis [35]. These findings highlight the complexity and potential of manipulating nanoparticle properties and their protein corona to achieve targeted delivery to specific organs, including the lungs. Therefore, one promising avenue involves the introduction of cationic lipids into the liposomal formulation, which may introduce a more balanced surface charge to achieve lung-targeting. However, the exact mechanisms and optimal strategies require further investigation to enhance the efficacy of lung-targeted liposomal delivery systems. \n\nIn addition, pharmacokinetic experiment was conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetic profiles of PC-Lipo and PS-Lipo in mice. As shown in Fig. 5C, PS-Lipo exhibited a faster metabolic rate compared to PC-Lipo.",

            "text": "There are two types of proteins in the protein corona [65,66]: opsonin and dysopsonin. Adsorption of opsonin at the nanoparticle surface results in its recognition by mononuclear macrophages, which rapidly clear it from circulation through first-pass metabolism. Adsorption of dysopsonin, on the other hand, has the opposite effect-it prolongs the circulation of a nanoparticle. The formation of a protein corona is a dynamic process and is affected by the affinity of the proteins to nanoparticles, as well as by the protein concentration in a biological medium. The hard corona is the inner layer, irreversibly bound to nanoparticle surface, and exchanges with the physiological medium within a matter of hours. The soft corona is the outer layer, reversibly bound to nanoparticle, and exchanges with the physiological medium on a timescale of seconds to minutes [67]. Since the hard corona remains bound to the surface until the degradation of the nanoparticle, it plays a more profound role than the soft corona in governing the downstream processing of the i.v. administered nanoparticle, such as endocytosis and translocation to different organs. The composition of the protein corona undergoes constant changes in circulation: albumin and fibrinogen, proteins that are abundant in serum, dominate the composition of the protein corona of an i.v. administered nanoparticle for a short period of time. In the long run, relatively scarce proteins with higher affinities and slower kinetics-such as apolipoprotein-may replace them [31]. The total amount of adsorbed protein, however, remains relatively constant [32]. \n\nFormation of a protein corona not only changes the pharmacokinetics, but also the pharmacodynamics of a nanoparticle by affecting its interaction with the various cells and subcellular organelles. As is the case for all foreign substances, nanoparticles are cleared from the bloodstream by cells of the RES. This part of the immune system consists of phagocytes such as monocytes and macrophages, which are mainly located in the liver, spleen, lungs, and lymph nodes.",

            "text": "Extracellular and intracellular interactions due to the protein corona's structural changes are further explained in Figure 17. \n\nMBGs are applied in anticancer therapeutic approaches owing to their drug delivery potential. Despite extensive in vitro investigation of these nanoparticles for active and passive anticancer targeted therapy, in vivo tumor targeting ability and therapeutic efficiency of these platforms is still a challenge leading to few clinical trials and even fewer clinical practices. [218] Protein corona formation affects both active and passive drug delivery mechanisms. Protein accumulation buries nanoparticles targeting ligands such as antibodies, aptamers, and peptides resulting in limited accessibility of targeting ligands to cell receptors and consequent loss of targeting to the tumor site. Protein corona formation decreases nanoparticles leaking to the tumor site, diminishing the efficiency of the passive drug delivery platform. [219] Dependent on the nature of the adsorbed protein, the protein corona can enhance or decrease nanoparticles susceptibility to clearance by the systemic circulation through phagocytosis by the mononuclear phagocyte system. Accumulation of opsonin proteins, such as fibrinogen and immunoglobulin G, on nanoparticles surface, enhances their recognition and ingest by macrophages resulting in prompt clearance from systemic circulation. Antithetically, protein corona composed of dysopsonin proteins, such as albumin and apolipoproteins, enhance nanoparticles' systemic circulation. [109] fective anticancer drug delivery is achievable by a proper protein corona design, and for this purpose, various strategies have been investigated based on three main approaches. The biomimetic approach uses different ligands to elude clearance by the mononuclear phagocyte system, thereby enhancing their systemic circulation. For instance, A 1-42 (SP) biocompatible peptide, which can interact with apolipoproteins, has been employed for liposome surface functionalization. This designed liposomal system potentially adsorbs plasma apolipoproteins, especially Apolipoprotein E, when exposed to biological fluids. The functionalized liposomal system showed better distribution and enhanced drug delivery efficacy compared to the plain liposomal system. [220]",

[95,112] Accordingly, their corresponding toxicity varies in different solvents. Besides, it is also well accepted that nanoparticles display different sizes or agglomeration state in biological media because of the formation of protein corona. [113] Such protein corona also changes the size and surface properties of nanoparticles, so as to influence their absorption, transportation, as well as toxicity.

Structures of lipids are presented in Figure S1. This resulted in testing three formulations: MC3/DSPC/Cholesterol/PEG (referred as DSPC/Chol), MC3/DOPE/Cholesterol/PEG (referred as DOPE/Chol), and MC3/DOPE/\u03b2-sitosterol/PEG (referred as DOPE/\u03b2S). \u03b2S possesses an additional ethyl group at the C24 position. All formulations resulted in LNPs of 76-95 nm with a neutral zeta potential (Table 1). Complexation of mRNA was verified by gel electrophoresis, with no free mRNA detectable (Figure 1A). Interestingly, DSPC containing LNPs exhibited a lower polydispersity index (0.066 for MC3/DSPC/Cholesterol/PEG vs. 0.16 for MC3/DOPE/Cholesterol/PEG and 0.13 for MC3/DOPE/\u03b2-sitosterol/PEG). These results indicate similarly low polydispersity for the three types of LNPs. We also monitored the size of LNPs after incubation with serum and at 37 \u2022 C by dynamic light scattering (Figure 1B). Proteins in serum could interact with the surface of LNPs and induce their aggregation. The three types of LNPs remained stable during incubation confirming the PEG-mediated stabilization of the nanoparticles in serum as previously reported [38,45,46]. The size of DOPE/\u03b2S LNPs moderately increased from 90 nm to 120 nm over 8 h.",

Whether the ionizable surface lipids drive the ''Protein adsorption/uptake\" has not yet been thoroughly investigated but they are likely involved in protein/apoE corona formation on the LNP surface. Note that many structural and biological properties of LNPs should be ascribed not to a single lipid component but rather a combination of lipids, as illustrated above. This is illustrated by all the LNP components that contribute to the structure/morphology of LNPs. The PEG-lipids dictate the LNP size, and thus, influence the ratio of the surface to core distribution of the remaining components, and thereby ultimately their packing motif. The light blue highlight illustrates that PEG-lipids containing a long lipid tail improve the in vivo stability of LNPs.

            "text": "The generally accepted view in nanomaterial research for biological applications is that the biologically relevant unit is not the pristine particle, but a nano-composite of specified size, shape, and selective protein corona structure. It has been extensively elucidated how NP size and functional groups can significantly shape the protein corona of the same bulk material nanoparticles [12,16,38,39] and here we address the effect of a protein coating on the formation of the corona in a biological fluid. Our results clearly show how functional groups determine the stability of physically adsorbed protein-NP conjugates much more than the bulk material. In fact, if NP incubation with Tf succeeds in the formation of stable, monodisperse monomer Tf coated conjugates, for both sulphonated and carboxylated polystyrene NPs (see Figure 2 and Table 1), DCS results on FC and HC protein complexes clearly indicate that physical Tf pre-coating inhibits the formation of a robust protein corona in the biological environment for sulphonated NPs (see Table 2 and Figure 3), but not for carboxylated ones. These structural findings are strongly supported by the biological investigation (SDS-PAGE, WB and MS analysis) reflecting very little exchange of Tf with the environmental proteins for Tf@ PSOSO 3 H NPs. Tf@PSCOOH NPs, instead, exhibit a rearrangement at the bionano interface with a big loss of Tf and consequent formation of a multi-protein corona after instantaneous contact with environmental proteins. The composition of this protein corona, although Tf-enriched, resembles the protein corona of pristine carboxylated NPs. As expected, Tf covalent linkage to the surface of carboxylated NPs provides a stable coating with the formation of monomer bio-conjugates whose structure and composition is almost invariant on  Table 4. The fluorescence intensity for positive interaction hits for Tf@PSOSO 3 H in 10%plasma and PBS.",

            "text": "Upon interaction with physiological/biological fluids, nanoparticles get covered by biological macromolecules forming a protein corona. The adsorption of proteins onto the surface of nanoparticles is modulated by Columbic and van der Waal's forces, hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding 109 . Further, the amount and chemical nature of proteins adsorbed onto nanoparticles is directly correlated with the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles and the cell type 110 . The protein corona comprises of a double layer comprising of hard inner shell (irreversible binding) and dynamic outer shell which interacts weakly with the adsorbed proteins 109 . The most common proteins involved in corona formation include opsonins (immunoglobulin, complement factor and fibrinogen) which are responsible for macrophage recognition and rapid clearance of nanoparticles from the circulation 111 . Reduced efficacy, denaturation and conformational changes can be introduced in the nanocarriers following protein corona formation 112 . Additionally, increased particle size significantly reduces cellular uptake and cell adhesion. However, reports also suggest that protein corona might be beneficial. Precoating of nanoparticles with human serum albumin prevents rapid clearance by RES and also modulates transient endocytic uptake switching the internalization of nanoparticles from macropinocytosis to CME leading to an altered intracellular trafficking 113 . Adsorption of apolipoproteins onto nanoparticles also improves transport across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) 114 . This was exemplified by transport of loperamide and dalargin across the blood brain barrier encapsulated in poly(butyl cyanoacrylate) nanoparticles coated with apolipoproteins. Results indicated significant anti-nociceptive action in comparison to uncoated nanoparticles confirming efficient transport across BBB. Moreover, the presence of preformed corona also contributed towards lowered nanoparticle aggregation and reduced toxicity.",

We saw that the in vivo protein corona highly differed compared to in vitro incubated nanoparticles, into account the dynamic biodistribution process and interaction with different biological structure and organs. Additionally, we noticed that the chosen anticoagulant should be carefully considered, as we observed significant differences in the corona composition after incubation with serum or plasma supplemented with heparin, EDTA, and citrate. For our here presented ex vivo approach, we demonstrated that the corona composition was comparable to the in vivo situation. Therefore, with this study we aimed to improve the understanding of in vivo corona formation, which is urgently needed in order to reveal the nanoparticles behaviour under physiological conditions.",

            "text": "Nanoparticles typically refer to tiny particles ranging from 1 to 100 nm, with their larger surface area and nanoscale size endowing them with unique physicochemical properties [73]. These nanoparticles can consist of single substances such as titanium dioxide, silver nanoparticles, gold nanoparticles, iron oxides, or complexes such as polymer-drug complexes, and nucleic acid-nanoparticle complexes, among others [74][75][76][77]. When nanoparticles enter living organisms, they first come into contact with biological fluids (e.g., blood, tissue fluids, etc.). Various components in biofluids, such as proteins, lipids, sugars, etc., quickly adsorb to the surface of the nanoparticles, forming the so-called \"protein corona\". The composition and structure of the protein corona depend on the physicochemical properties of the nanoparticles (e.g., size, shape, surface charge, hydrophilicity, etc.) and the environment of the biofluid (e.g., protein concentration, pH, ionic strength, etc.) [78,79]. For example, gold nanoparticles are smaller in size but have a relatively large specific surface area, which can provide more binding sites for proteins and make it easier to adsorb some low-molecular-weight proteins, such as albumin and transferrin [80]. Polymer nanoparticles with a diameter of several hundred nanometers may bind more to macromolecular proteins such as immunoglobulins [81]. The formation of protein corona will change the surface properties of nanoparticles and affect their subsequent interactions with biological systems, such as biorecognition, immune response, and cellular uptake of nanoparticles [82,83]. Nanoparticles may be recognized by the immune system as a foreign body, triggering an immune response. Immune cells such as macrophages and monocytes can ingest nanoparticles through phagocytosis, which can lead to the removal of nanoparticles before they reach the target site, reducing the efficiency of drug delivery.",

            "text": "After entering the biological system, nanoparticles interact with the biomolecules in the body and will give rise to a layer called the \"corona\". This happens within seconds of nanoparticle exposure by a process called the Vroman effect. This layer consists of many biomolecules with increased adsorption and enhanced properties compared to those in the normal biological environment. Thus, this has a high impact on the ultimate performance of these nanoparticles. The liquid profile and protein composition of this corona layer have been extensively studied with respect to various works. According to the adsorption rate of proteins to their surface, the corona can be classified into two main categories: a hard corona and a soft corona. High affinity proteins tightly and directly associated with nanoparticles will form a hard corona, and low affinity proteins loosely and indirectly associated with nanoparticles will form a soft corona. While taking this into consideration, a hard corona is more convenient in terms of nanotechnology. The structure and composition of the corona layer can be studied by various techniques, such as DLS, SEC, DCS, TEM, PAGE, LC-MS/MS, DC, SPR, ITC, etc. Parameters like the number of bonds, thermodynamic feasibility of interaction, rearrangements of molecules, temperature, conformational changes, solvation, influence of other proteins, etc., determine the nanomaterial\u2212 protein adsorption effect. 11 Generally, there are 3 steps in the protein adsorption to nanoparticles, especially for gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) (Figure :2): \n\n\u2022 Region 1: characterized by protein\u2212NP surface interaction only with original protein conformation. \n\n\u2022 Region 2: characterized by protein\u2212protein interactions and protein\u2212NP interactions with changes in its structural conformations. \n\n\u2022 Region 3: characterized by protein\u2212protein interactions only, along with structural alterations and protein multilayer formation. \n\nThe composition of the corona is formed by different types of plasma proteins, viz., immunoglobulins, tissue leakage proteins, complement factors, coagulants, lipoproteins, and other serum components. They are collectively called \"adsorbomes\" after the adsorption mechanism.",

AuNPs were prepared from Fusarium oxysporum at two different temperatures and characterized by spectrophotometry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The zeta potential of AuNPs was determined using a Zetasizer. AuNPs were incubated with 3 different concentrations of mouse plasma, and the hard protein corona was detected first by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and then by electrospray liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The profiles were compared to AuNPs alone that served as control. The results showed that round and oval AuNPs with sizes below 50 nm were produced at both temperatures. The AuNPs were stable after the formation of the protein corona and had sizes larger than 86 nm, and their zeta potential remained negative. We found that capping agents in the control samples contained small peptides/amino acids but almost no protein(s). After hard protein corona formation, we identified plasma proteins present on the surface of AuNPs. The identified plasma proteins may contribute to the AuNPs being shielded from phagocytizing immune cells, which makes the AuNPs a promising candidate for in vivo drug delivery. The protein corona on the surface of biologically produced AuNPs differed depending on the capping agents of the individual AuNP samples and the plasma concentration.",

            "text": "The small hydrodynamic diameter and unique structure of NPs offer increased adsorption and catalytic efficiency. The NP surface potential plays an essential role in the interaction between protein and NPs as opposite charges produce strong interaction and result in high conformational changes [76]. The conjugation of antibodies on nanoparticle surfaces enhances the delivery of drug cargo specifically to disease sites. Once NPs enter the blood stream, they instantly absorb proteins to form a protein corona, which may prominently impede the binding of antibodies to their receptors [77]. There is increasing evidence that NPs conjugated with antibodies, peptides, and aptamers lose the ability to recognize or bind with specific receptors after protein corona formation. Also, NPs that adsorb opsonins, such as immunoglobulins, complement components, and fibrinogen, on their surface are cleared from the body effortlessly by the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS) [78]. The targeting efficiency of antibody-conjugated NPs is directly affected by their physicochemical properties, including hydrodynamic diameter, surface potential, shape, functional groups, and hydrophobicity. The protein corona reduces the targeted delivery of NPs by disturbing or inhibiting the binding of target molecules to their receptors. Mirshafiee et al. used a copper-free click reaction to decorate fluorescent silica NPs with bicyclononyne. They exposed the NPs to media that mimicked in vitro culture conditions (10% serum) and biological fluids present in vivo (100% serum). They observed an increase in size and a slight decrease in negative charge in serum-containing media, which confirmed protein corona formation. The protein corona establishes a barrier between the ligand and the target, significantly reducing the NP targeting efficiency as compared to bare NPs [79]. Salvati et al. developed transferrin (Tf)-modified fluorescent silica NPs to evaluate the effect of the protein corona on active targeting. Differential centrifugal sedimentation and immunological dot-blot studies revealed that increased serum concentration significantly reduced the binding of Tf-modified NPs to their receptors.",

In addition, our analysis revealed that a considerable portion of the employed protein source for protein corona studies is human plasma, which is the most relevant protein source for clinical translation of nanotechnologies. However, more detailed information on the plasma donors should be provided in future studies, as many factors including health spectrum and sex can significantly affect the composition and function of protein corona. [26,32,57] Achieving such robust nano-bio information will help the scientific community design safer and more efficient therapeutic/diagnostic NPs [4] and also address the thus-far inadequately explained [58] biological outcomes of clinically relevant NPs. [59] The nanomedicine community also needs to develop standard methods for mass spectroscopy analysis of protein coronas, as very recent findings revealed the critical role of heterogeneity in proteomics analysis of nanoparticle protein corona. [36] Finally, a more robust understanding of the protein corona formed on the surface of lipid-based NPs may facilitate development of efficient, safe, and immune-cell-specific mRNA delivery systems that could pave the way for introduction and widescale use of both current and next-generation robust mRNA-based immunotherapeutics.

Searching the PubMed database with keywords \"nanoparticle\" and \"corona\" within 20 years yielded 2134 manuscripts, which were included in the initial database. Review manuscripts and papers related to the coronavirus were excluded, resulting in 1594 papers. Papers investigating protein corona formation with a single protein or just a few pre-determined proteins were also excluded, as were papers lacking physical, chemical or biological characterization of the formed protein corona around nanoparticles. A final 470 research manuscripts involving 1702 different NPs were identified and analyzed by application of three main analysis criteria: NPs characterization, nano-bio parameters, and biosystem elements (28 parameters).",

The cell sees the protein-coated NPs as the synthetic identity is masked by protein surfacing. The PC formation ultimately has a substantial impact on various biological processes including drug release, drug targeting, cell recognition, biodistribution, cellular uptake, and therapeutic efficacy. Further, the composition of PC is largely influenced by the physico-chemical properties of NPs viz. the size, shape, surface charge, and surface chemistry in the biological milieu. However, the change in the biological responses of the new substrate depends on the quantity of protein access by the NPs. The PC-layered NPs act as new biological entities and are recognized as different targeting agents for the receptor-mediated ingress of therapeutics in the biological cells. The corona-enveloped NPs have both pros and cons in the biological system. The review provides a brief insight into the impact of biomolecules on nanomaterials carrying cargos and their ultimate fate in the biological milieu.",

            "text": "Nanoparticle (NP) size represents a critical parameter defining the blood circulation, biodistribution, tumor accumulation, and cellular uptake of NADS.Notably, NPs size profoundly influences their fate in vivo.For example, small NPs (< 5 nm) are extremely easy to pass through the renal filtration membrane and are eliminated by the kidney, whereas NPs greater than 10 nm can be enriched with tumors through EPR effects.Furthermore, NPs within the size range of 50-200 nm exhibit a propensity for spleen accumulation, likely due to \"protein coronas\" formed by proteins adsorbed on the surface of the NPs (Figure 3) [25].Particle size is a key physicochemical property of NADS that directly affects the contact area of NADS interaction with blood components, thereby influencing protein corona formation and blood circulation time of NADS [26].In general, the protein adsorption of NPs is size-dependent, especially for lipid-based vectors.Larger NPs with a larger volume tend to adsorb more proteins, resulting in greater protein coverage, while smaller NPs exhibit reduced interactions with blood proteins due to their higher surface curvature [27].For instance, Cui et al. [28] found that the 150 nm automated LNPs had higher mRNA lacking efficacy and stronger serum adsorption ability during blood circulation than the smaller ones (70 nm), highlighting the contribution of particle size to protein corona formation and excellent mRNA delivery.This underscores the role of particle size in protein corona formation and efficient mRNA delivery.These automated LNPs could facilitate cytoplasmic mRNA encoding luciferase (Luc-mRNA) delivery and mediate efficient and prolonged luciferase expression in vivo.However, there are exceptions, as suggested by Partikel's [29] study, which indicates that polymeric NPs exhibit protein adsorption independent of particle size within the 100-200 nm range.Therefore, the influence of the particle size of NADS on its protein crown adsorption is intricately related to the properties of the carrier itself.\n\nParticle size also has a significant influence on the distribution and accumulation of NADS in tumors.",

            "text": "The significance of protein coronas on the biological fates of nanoparticles has been widely recognized. Therefore, the alterations on biological effects caused by protein coronas need systemic study and interpretation in order to design novel safe and efficient nanomedicines. In the present study, we present a comprehensive quantitative analysis of the protein coronas on gold nanorods coated with various surface ligands of different chemical composition and charge. The design of surface ligands is the most importance for the functionization of nanoparticles and further the ligand-induced biological identity determines the fate of nanoparticles in human body. We found that the surface chemistry influences the composition of the protein corona more profoundly than surface charge. Since the first and most important challenge for administrated nanomedicines is navigating the interaction with macrophages, we further investigated how the surface chemistry-induced specific biomolecular corona affects the phagocytosis and immune responses of macrophages exposed to the corona-nanoparticle complexes. Our results reveal that the protein corona alters the internalization pathways of nanorods by macrophages via the interactions of the predominant coronal proteins with specific receptors on the cell membrane. The cytokine secretion profile of macrophages is also highly dependent on the adsorption pattern of the protein corona. The more abundant proteins involved in immune responses, such as acute phase, complement, and tissue leakage proteins, present in the acquired nanoparticle corona, the more macrophage IL-1\u03b2 released is stimulated. The ligand-protein corona composition-immune response coefficient analysis may serve next-generation nanomedicines with high-efficiency and good-safety for better clinical translation.",

            "text": "While arguably holding equal importance to the effect of size, the effect of shape on the evolution of a protein corona around AuNPs is less understood.Spherical nanoparticles are often seen by researchers as a logical starting point for biological studies and thus, there are markedly less number of studies performed on AuNPs of differing shape.\n\nFurthermore, synthesizing AuNPs of varying shape brings an additional layer of complexity to the synthesis process, particularly when doing comparative studies.For the observation of true shape effects, parameters such as chemical structure, surface charge and to an extent, surface area must be kept constant.In this way, only systematic studies which keep these factors constant while solely varying the particle shape can be treated as true indicators of the effect of AuNP shape on protein corona formation.From the small pool of studies conducted, it has been observed that the geometric properties that determine shape such as curved surfaces, planar sides, sharp edges, corners, ridges and pores affect the way in which proteins interact with a given particle (Fig 6).The relationship does not appear to be governed by general rules but rather by the specific nature of each protein and nanoparticle, respectively.In this way, geometric features have been described as exhibiting both blocking and assistive effects for the binding of proteins depending on protein size and conformation (Mahmoudi et al. 2011).\n\nDue, in part to the difficulty of performing highly precise systematic studies in vitro, in silico simulations are utilized as a predictive tool to observe the way in which different shaped AuNPs and proteins may interact.Ramezani and coworkers performed a dynamic simulation study to probe the interaction of HSA binding to cubic and spherical AuNPs (Ramezani et al. 2014).The study maintained the common idea that curved surfaces such as those found on spherical AuNPs better accommodate the binding of HSA molecules.Furthermore, this study calculated the distance which would theoretically separate the protein molecule from the AuNPs should they interact.These calculations determined that HSA molecules are indeed able to position closer to the surface of a spherical particle when compared to the cubic particle.However despite the increased distance, the planar surfaces which confine the cubic particle cause the albumin to unfold, generating structural changes much more strongly than spherical AuNPs.",

            "text": "Increased exploitation of nanotechnology in biomedical applications has led to significant progress in the field of cancer diagnosis, mirroring the potential of nanostructured biomaterials in personalized medicine [1]. In recent years, the arena of bio-nano interactions has given hope for new perspectives on cancer detection [2]. In the early history of this field, pioneering investigations by Dawson and coworkers clarified that nanoparticles (NPs) immersed in biological fluids are coated with a protein-enriched layer that was termed the \"protein corona\" (PC) [3]. In the scientific community, many efforts have been made to understand the principles that regulate the formation, structure, and equilibrium composition of the PC. The practically endless number of combinations between NPs with different chemical-physical properties and biological fluids (e.g., blood, saliva, gastric fluids, interstitial fluids) [4], made rationalizing the results a difficult task. The scenario was also complicated by our understanding that the PC is affected by environmental factors such as exposure time, temperature, and shear stress. Looking back over the past 15 years, we highlight the fact that the PC arises from a complex interplay of the NPs' physical-chemical properties, the protein source, and the environmental factors. Many review papers have examined these aspects in detail [5][6][7][8] and, therefore, we refer the reader to these contributions for more in-depth information. We want to focus on the fact that the protein corona gives the NPs a new identity, referred to as \"biological identity\", which drastically affects its performance in a physiological environment (e.g., biodistribution, toxicity, off-target accumulation, targeted delivery, etc.) [9]. Furthermore, the PC may contain information about a patient's proteome, and decoding this code has become a priority in biomedical research. After a decade of research, we are now aware that the PC does not merely reflect the composition of the human proteome but preferentially includes plasma proteins with a high affinity for particle surface [10]. This finding had immediate implications in the research of tumor biomarkers.",

With ITC it is possible to study the binding or adsorption behavior of proteins towards nanoparticles in situ. 9,36 We observed a strong binding of plasma proteins towards uncoated PS-COOH NPs (black circles). This interaction was diminished when NPs were pre-coated (red circles), which further highlights the stealth properties of the pre-formed protein corona. This is in accordance with the cellular uptake that was shown to be strongly reduced if nanoparticles were pre-coated (Fig. 2). \n\nAs described in previous work, interactions of NPs with plasma proteins can cause aggregation of NPs hereby highly affecting their in vivo biodistribution. 37 With multi angle dynamic light scattering (DLS) it is possible to monitor the size of nanoparticles incubated with plasma. 29,38 This method allows studying direct interactions of proteins and nanoparticles without applying any washing step. When uncoated PS-COOH nanoparticles were applied to plasma, an overall size increase of \u223c100 nm was measured indicating aggregation formation (Fig. 3E and raw data Fig. S6 and S7 \u2020). In strong contrast to this, we did not observe any size increase for precoated PS-COOH nanoparticles after plasma incubation. This underlines that the pre-formed protein corona remains stable after re-exposure to plasma. \n\nOverall, we were able to present here a set of different analytical methods that can be generally applied to investigate if a defined pre-coating can enable targeted cell interaction. \n\nFor the here chosen model system using IgG depleted plasma we were able to prove that pre-coating offers the possibility to tailor the biological properties of the nanoparticles. \n\nAs highlighted above (Fig. 1) and intensively studied in literature the nanoparticle charge can significantly influence protein corona formation 34 and cellular uptake behavior. 17 herefore, we additionally explored the influence of precoating with IgG depleted plasma for amino-functionalized nanoparticles (PS-NH 2 ) (Fig. 4).",

We selected this second approach to separate the protein corona from the surface of the nanoparticles because this is a stronger method of separation and it can also be used easily and is highly reproducible.\n\nDerived from Tables S1 and S2, Table S3 shows the proteins detected in the soft and hard corona grouped according to their biological function. Proteins from different functional categories and/or cell components, lipoproteins, complement, coagulation, immunoglobulins, enzymes and transport proteins were identified in all samples. In order to investigate how the coating of the particles determines their biointeractions and how it governs their biological fate, the protein amounts were semi-quantitatively analysed by applying the spectral-counting method. The NpSpCk represents the total number of the MS spectra for all peptides attributed to a matched protein divided by its molecular weight (Mw) in Da. This ratio takes into account the protein size and evaluates the real contribution of each protein to the corona composition [29].\n\nAs shown in Figure 5, the relative abundance of proteins on the surface of both types of nanoparticles was comparable. In general, it is assumed that PEGylation extends blood circulation times through a significant reduction in protein binding, which is responsible for its \"stealth\" behaviour in vivo [66,67]. In line with this idea, different studies have correlated the amount of bound proteins (as an indicator of opsonization) with cell internalization or half-life circulation and measured reduced protein adsorption to nanoparticles incorporating PEGylated components [68][69][70]. In contrast, other studies have demonstrated that PEGylation increases half-life in the blood but does not reduce protein adsorption. In fact, several studies have reported that PEGylation increases protein binding [67].\n\nOverall, PEGylation of the nanoparticles did not show a significant variation in their interactions with the proteins according to their biological function. However, the analysis of the relative abundance of the top three most represented proteins in the corona of the nanoparticles (serum albumin, apolipoprotein A-I and Ig kappa",

            "text": "recently been used as immunomodulators, enzyme inhibitors, and transporters of therapeutic proteins. These new applications are associated with the protein-nanoparticle interaction, a phenomenon termed as \"protein corona.\" The layer of proteins adsorbed on NPs functions as a biological module in vivo and is difficult to understand at the level of a single protein. The process underlying corona formation is complicated and involves complex kinetics and dynamics. Thus, the in vivo behavior of NPs relies on protein corona formation, which defines the biological activity or toxicity of NPs. Protein corona formation is highly diverse depending on the sources and/or production methods of NP systems, including metals, metal oxides, polymers, composites, and CNTs. For example, gold nanoparticles affected albumin in the circulating system, 17 while those produced by enzymatic method showed binding to cellular RNAs and proteins. 18 Caseincoated gold NP can translocate across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), resulting in corona formation with Abeta42. 19 Magnesium oxide (MgO) NPs spontaneously form an albumin complex upon introduction, 20 while MgO NPs produced through green synthesis can also interact with cellular proteins such as superoxide dismutase 1 (Sod1) and p53 after internalization into cells. 21 Regarding protein corona formation, the structural changes in proteins on NPs should be noted and studied to enhance the in vivo availability of NPs. The correct structure of the protein is necessary for its proper function. Various biological systems, including chaperons, proteasome, autophagy, and ER-associated degradation monitor the quality of the protein structure and tightly regulate the fate of proteins in cells depending on their conformational state. 22 Uncontrolled disruption of the folding pathway can lead to disease onset. For example, the unfolding or misfolding of proteins is directly related to amyloid-associated diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, [23][24][25] Parkinson's disease, 26,27 type 2 diabetes, 28 and familial amyloidosis. 29,30 The immunoglobulin light-chain in the blood stream occasionally forms aggregates, accumulates at various sites, and causes a significant problem in the body, which may be due to",

Reprinted with permission [38]. \n\nMoreover, studies have shown that upon IV administration PEG-lipid with short lipid tails tend to desorb from LNPs, inducing a change in surface structure that allows ApoE adsorption to LNPs, with the formation of a protein corona that affects their endosomal escape and mRNA release. ApoE in blood serum showed specificity for hepatocytes leading to LNP accumulation in the liver as exploited in Onpattro \u00ae formulation. In this product, the drug patisiran is delivered using LNPs composed of ionizable lipid (DLin-MC3-DMA), phosphatidylcholine derivate (DSPC), cholesterol, and PEG-lipid (PEG2000-C-DMG). Once the drug is administered into the systemic circulation, the PEG-lipid is replaced by serum proteins, mainly ApoE, which interact with the cholesterol component of the lipid complex and target the drug to the liver [117,118]. Furthermore, PEG-lipids can be functionalized with specific ligands such as folate for siRNA delivery or N-acetylgalactosamine for targeting liver hepatocytes [80]. \n\nFor instance, the addition of PEG or poloxamine coatings to NPs has been found to reduce complement activation, while dextran coatings increase it.

Moreover, PVP (polyvinylpyrrolidone) has been used in this research to reduce the amount of protein bound to the filling. The PEI-coated Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles were further coated with (1.0-2.5%) PVP solution at about 4 \u2022 C with 200 rpm for overnight to (1.0-2.5%) PVP-PEI-Fe 3 O 4 . Shielding with 2% PVP improved the elution of lipases with 1 M NaCl as eluent. The elution of Mucor miehei lipase increased from 56.8% to 68.3%. Similar results were observed for lipase from Candida rugosa. \n\nGr\u00e4fe et al. [157] and Calatayud et al.

Materials designed for biomedical and therapeutic applications generally come into contact with protein reach body fluids. Proteins are usually adsorbed on the surface of material to form an enveloping layer known as the \"protein corona\". This process can be thought of as physical immobilization. The protein corona, which is formed as soon as nanoparticles come into contact with biological systems, plays a key role in the biological role of nanoparticles. Gr\u00e4fe et al. describe a strategy to control the amount of adsorbed proteins on the surface of nanoparticles and the effect of such corona proteins on particle-cell interactions.

            "text": "When NPs are exposed to biofluids such as plasma and serum, proteins (as well as other biomolecules) may be dynamically adsorbed onto their surface, forming a so-called protein corona (Monopoli et al. 2012;Walkey and Chan 2012). This alters the size, aggregation state, and interfacial properties of the nanomaterial, endowing it with a biological identity that is quite distinct from its native synthetic one (Docter et al. 2015). It is this biological identity that elicits physiological responses (namely agglomeration, cellular uptake, circulation lifetime, signaling, kinetics, accumulation, and toxicity) by mediating the interaction of the nanomaterial with biomolecules, membranes, and physical barriers (Setyawati et al. 2015). \n\nThe precise mechanism(s) of formation of the protein corona is still far from being adequately explained, since it is a complex process that depends on numerous parameters pertaining to the nanomaterial (size, shape, charge, hydrophobicity, composition, surface functionalization, and topography), the proteins (size, shape, charge, surface functionality, isoelectric point, and conformational flexibility), the physiological environment (polarity, ionic strength, pH, and temperature), and the exposure time (Mahmoudi et al. 2011(Mahmoudi et al. , 2013;;Shemetov et al. 2012). \n\nThe use of targeted NPs in bio-nanotechnology could therefore be improved by manipulating their surface properties to bind proteins selectively in order to modulate or control effects on signaling, uptake kinetics, transport, accumulation, and toxicity (Mahmoudi et al. 2011;Schick et al. 2014). Meanwhile, the NP itself may alter the structure of the adsorbed proteins, leading to significant conformational changes-up to denaturation-with concomitant loss of their biological function and potentially hazardous consequences (Chen et al. 2014;Kim et al. 2013;Kopp et al. 2017;Saptarshi et al. 2013;Wang et al. 2017).",

For lipid A, formulations made with DEPE showed higher hEPO expression than those made with DOPE for both IV and IM routes of administration (p < 0.05, Figure 2A,B). On the other hand, for lipid B, LNPs made with DEPE showed higher hEPO levels over B-DOPE LNPs only for IV (p < 0.05) but not for the IM dosing route (Figure 2C,D). \n\nIn the context of systemic delivery, LNPs in circulation undergo dynamic interactions with serum proteins forming a protein corona, which has significant implications on the kinetics, interactions, and affinity of the LNPs with different cell types. 24 Composition and formulation changes in LNPs can alter the protein corona, thereby modulating LNP\u2212cell interactions. 25 For instance, the binding of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) affects LNP uptake by hepatocytes through the lowdensity lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). PC-and PE-based helper lipids formulated into LNPs can differentially influence their ApoE adsorption and thus hepatic delivery. 13 Recently, Zhou et al. demonstrated efficient dendritic cell (DC) uptake of ApoE3-incorporated biomimetic nanoparticles through the macropinocytosis pathway for cancer immunotherapy. 26 In this work, we observed that incorporating PE-based helper lipids with differing tail lengths into LNPs resulted in significant differences in their potencies through different routes of delivery. To investigate if these differences could be attributed to differential ApoE binding, the four LNPs were evaluated for their ApoE affinity using a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D). The dissipation and frequency shifts of all four sensors were monitored in real time (Figure 2E\u2212G).",

            "text": "Many experimental techniques have been used to investigate the binding of proteins to nanoparticles and some models have been proposed to rationalize the experiments [10,32]. The most accepted view on protein corona formation is that proteins that adsorb with high affinity form a \"hard\" corona, do not readily desorb and show larger exchange times in the order of several hours. The \"soft\" corona is formed by proteins that adsorb with low affinity, are loosely bound, and are in permanent exchange with other proteins [9,28]. However, the mechanisms of protein corona formation are still debated and no existing model can fully explain it [6,10,29]. Comparing different NPs in blood plasma, it has been shown experimentally that the physicochemical properties of a given nanoparticle determine also their individual \"adsorbome\" [10]. \n\nIn the present study we used polymer-coated monodisperse SPIOs (11 nm core, total hydrodynamic diameter about 25 nm), as well as PEGylated variants as model nanoparticles. The iron oxide cores were labelled with 59 Fe and we used an iodination kit to label also transferrin or albumin with 125 I to trace the exchange of corona proteins in vitro and also in vivo in mice. These two proteins are of physiological relevance with albumin as the most abundant plasma protein and transferrin with a well understood function in iron transport and already widely used in transferrin-conjugated nanoparticles [20,21,23]. As shown in a recent metaanalysis of adsorbed corona proteins from 63 different nanoparticles in 26 studies, our chosen test proteins were also among the group of adsorbed plasma proteins which show a high abundance (>10%) in coronas from many NPs [10]. \n\nMost of the results on the composition, structure, and binding kinetics of the protein corona were so far performed ex situ and required the adequate isolation of the NPs from an artificial or physiological environment for example by differential centrifugation (DC) of size exclusion chromatography (SEC) [30,31]. \n\nThese techniques are easy to perform and allow the use of modern measuring technology to analyze parameters of the protein corona.",

Several contributions reported zeta potential of nanoparticles in water or in buffered media. In the case of silica, zeta potential gradually decreases by addition of electrolytes. 44 Nevertheless, this information may only be relevant when toxicological tests will be conducted in serum-free media. Thus, once NPs come into contact with biological environmental fluid they become rapidly surrounded by other molecules like vitamins and proteins. 28 herefore, NPs-medium interface and dispersivity in the suspension media may be the most critical characteristics which are altered going from stock solution to real suspension media. Fortunately, in the last years, first reports on the direct biological influence of proteins on the biological activity of nanoparticles have been published. For instance, Lesniak et al. 102 showed that serum proteins critically affect cell adhesion and internalization of silica nanoparticles. Rezwan et al. reported the change in zeta potential for silica upon adsorption of bovine serum albumin and lysosome. 103 Interestingly, in our previous work 25 we showed that serum content substantially affects the colloidal stability and toxicity of 30 nm silica nanoparticles on eukaryotic cells in XTT assays (Fig. 6). On the other hand, Tenzer et al. 104 showed that particle size substantially affects the composition of the serum corona. Dutta et al. 105 showed that 10 nm amorphous silica coated with albumin induced anti-inflammatory responses in macrophages. Interestingly, a pre-coating of the nanoparticles with the nonionic surfactant Pluronic F127 inhibits the antiinflammatory properties of the nanoparticles, indicating once again that proteins modulate the uptake of amorphous SNPs. \n\nThus, the presence of proteins affects the biological activity related to silica nanoparticles.",

Much more proteins were strongly adsorbed to all particles studied at higher serum concentrations, and although incubation time, surface roughness, and particle surface chemistry did have an in\ue104uence on the amount of proteins adsorbed, the in\ue104uence of these parameters remained small as compared to the serum concentration. Importantly, the relative amount of smaller proteins was clearly higher under full serum conditions as compared to 10% serum, and especially the amounts of apolipoproteins was increasing with increasing serum concentration. Our results thus highlight the necessity to carry out protein adsorption studies under full serum conditions if a link between the protein adsorption and the in vivo performance of nanoparticles is aimed for.",

            "text": "Gold nanoparticles have the potential to be used in biomedical applications from diagnostics to drug delivery. However, interactions of gold nanoparticles with different biomolecules in the cellular environment result in the formation of a \u201cprotein corona\u201d\u2014a layer of protein formed around a nanoparticle, which induces changes in the properties of nanoparticles. In this work we developed methods to reproducibly synthesize spheroidal and star-shaped gold nanoparticles, and carried out a physico-chemical characterization of synthesized anionic gold nanospheroids and gold nanostars through transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), zeta potential (ZP), nanoparticles tracking analysis (NTA), ultraviolet-visible (UV\u2013Vis) spectroscopy and estimates of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) signal enhancement ability. We analyzed how they interact with proteins after pre-incubation with bovine serum albumin (BSA) via UV\u2013Vis, DLS, ZP, NTA, SERS, cryogenic TEM (cryo-TEM) and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. The tests demonstrated that the protein adsorption on the particles\u2019 surfaces was different for spheroidal and star shaped particles. In our experiments, star shaped particles limited the protein corona formation at SERS \u201chot spots\u201d. This benefits the small-molecule sensing of nanostars in biological media. This work adds more understanding about protein corona formation on gold nanoparticles of different shapes in biological media, and therefore guides design of particles for studies in vitro and in vivo.",

Native SiO2, amine (-NH2) and carboxy (-COO(-)) modified NP were examined following incubation in mammalian growth media containing fetal bovine serum (FBS) for 1, 4, 24 and 48 hours. The protein corona transition from its early dynamic state to the later more stable corona was evaluated using mass spectrometry. The NP diameter was 22.4 \u00b1 2.2 nm measured by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). Changes in hydrodynamic diameter and agglomeration kinetics were studied using dynamic light scattering (DLS). The initial surface chemistry of the NP played an important role in the development and final composition of the protein corona, impacting agglomeration kinetics and NP toxicity. Particle toxicity, indicated by changes in membrane integrity and mitochondrial activity, was measured by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and tetrazolium reduction (MTT), respectively, in mouse alveolar macrophages (RAW264.7) and mouse lung epithelial cells (C10). SiO2-COO(-) NP had a slower agglomeration rate, formed smaller aggregates, and exhibited lower cytotoxicity compared to SiO2 and SiO2-NH2. Composition of the protein corona for each of the three NP was unique, indicating a strong dependence of corona development on NP surface chemistry. This work underscores the need to understand all aspects of NP toxicity, particularly the influence of agglomeration on effective dose and particle size. Furthermore, the interplay between materials and local biological environment is emphasized and highlights the need to conduct toxicity profiling under physiologically relevant conditions that provide an appropriate estimation of material modifications that occur during exposure in natural environments.",

The presence of this corona strongly affects the following interactions at cell and organism levels. It has been shown that corona proteins can be recognized by cell receptors. However, it is not known whether the composition of this acquired layer can also affect the mechanisms nanoparticles use to enter cells. This is of particular importance when considering that the same nanoparticles can form different coronas for instance in vitro when exposed to cells in different serum amounts or in vivo depending on the exposure or administration route. Thus, in this work, different coronas were formed on 50 nm silica by exposing them to different serum concentrations. The uptake efficiency in HeLa cells was compared, and the uptake mechanisms were characterized using transport inhibitors and RNA interference. The results showed that the nanoparticles were internalized by cells via different mechanisms when different coronas were formed, and only for one corona condition was uptake mediated by the LDL receptor. This suggested that coronas of different composition can be recognized differently by cell receptors, and this in turn leads to internalization via different mechanisms. Similar studies were performed using other cells, including A549 cells and primary HUVEC, and different nanoparticles, namely 100 nm liposomes and 200 nm silica. Overall, the results confirmed that the corona composition can affect the mechanisms of nanoparticle uptake by cells.",

However, when nanoparticles are injected into the bloodstream, their surface is instantly modified upon interaction with blood components, principally with proteins. It is well known that a dynamic and multi-layered protein structure is formed spontaneously on the nanoparticle upon contact with physiological media, which has been termed protein corona. Although several determinant factors involved in protein corona formation have been identified from in vitro studies, specific relationships between the nanomaterial synthetic identity and its ensuing biological identity under realistic in vivo conditions remain elusive. We present here a detailed study of in vivo protein corona formation after blood circulation of anisotropic gold nanoparticles (nanorods and nanostars). Plasmonic gold nanoparticles of different shapes and sizes were coated with polyethyleneglycol, intravenously administered in CD-1 mice and subsequently recovered. The results from gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry analysis revealed the formation of complex protein coronas, as early as 10 minutes post-injection.

This corona may be expressed as a durable, stabilizing coating of the bare surface of nanoparticle (NP) monomers, or it may be reflected in different subpopulations of particle assemblies, each presenting a durable protein coating. Using the approach and concepts of physical chemistry, we relate studies on the composition of the protein corona at different plasma concentrations with structural data on the complexes both in situ and free from excess plasma. This enables a high degree of confidence in the meaning of the hard protein corona in a biological context. Here, we present the protein adsorption for two compositionally different NPs, namely sulfonated polystyrene and silica NPs. NP-protein complexes are characterized by differential centrifugal sedimentation, dynamic light scattering, and zeta-potential both in situ and once isolated from plasma as a function of the protein/NP surface area ratio. We then introduce a semiquantitative determination of their hard corona composition using one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrospray liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, which allows us to follow the total binding isotherms for the particles, identifying simultaneously the nature and amount of the most relevant proteins as a function of the plasma concentration. We find that the hard corona can evolve quite significantly as one passes from protein concentrations appropriate to in vitro cell studies to those present in in vivo studies, which has deep implications for in vitro-in vivo extrapolations and will require some consideration in the future.",

The corona has a dynamic nature with the adsorbed proteins constantly exchanging with the free proteins in the matrix at various rates. The rapidly exchanging proteins compose the soft corona, which responds more dynamically to environment changes than the hard corona established by the ones with slow exchange rates. In the present study, the corona formed on the superparamagnetic iron oxide NPs (SPIONs) in human serum was studied by flow field-flow fractionation and ultracentrifugation, which rapidly differentiated the corona proteins based on their exchange rates. By varying the surface hydrophobicity of the SPIONs with a core size around 10 nm, we found out that, the more hydrophobic surface ligand attracted proteins with higher surface hydrophobicity and formed a more dynamic corona with a larger portion of the involved proteins with fast exchange rates. Increasing the core diameter of the SPIONs but keeping the surface ligand the same could also result in a more dynamic corona. A brief investigation of the effect on the cellular uptake of SPIONs using one selected corona protein, transferrin, was conducted. The result showed that, only the stably bound transferrin could significantly enhance cellular uptake, while transferrin bound in a dynamic nature had negligible impact. Our study has led to a better understanding of the relationship between the particle properties and the dynamic nature of the corona, which can help with design of nanomaterials with higher biocompatibility and higher efficacy in biosystems for biomedical applications.",

Adsorption of proteins could be influenced by chiral surfaces of nanoparticles; however, very few quantitative studies are available on the interaction of protein with the chiral surface of nanoparticles, and the underlying mechanism remains largely unresolved. We have developed a strategy to quantitatively analyze the adsorption and conformational features of transferrin on gold nanoparticles that are functionalized with d, l, and racemic penicillamine. We used a quartz microbalance platform to monitor the interaction of the adsorbed transferrin with transferrin receptors in HEK cell-derived liposomes. Results show that the chiral surface of nanoparticle determines the orientation and conformation of transferrin, which subsequently affects the interaction and recognition of transferrin with its receptor on the cellular membrane. Transferrin is widely used as a tumor-targeting ligand in cancer treatment and diagnosis since the transferrin receptor is overexpressed on the cell membrane of various types of cancer cells. Thus, the present results will help to expand the knowledge on biological identity of nanoparticles with chiral surfaces in a physiological environment and provide an insight into the rational design of therapeutic nanoparticles.",

For particles with different diameters, surface hydrophilicity appears to mediate early clearance. Densities above a critical value of approximately 20 poly(ethylene glycol) chains (MW 5\u2009kDa) per 100\u2009nm2 prolong circulation times, irrespective of size. In knockout mice, clearance mechanisms are identified for nanoparticles with low and high steric protection. Studies in animals deficient in the C3 protein showed that complement activation could not explain differences in the clearance of nanoparticles. In nanoparticles with low poly(ethylene glycol) coverage, adsorption of apolipoproteins can prolong circulation times. In parallel, the low-density-lipoprotein receptor plays a predominant role in the clearance of nanoparticles, irrespective of poly(ethylene glycol) density.

As expected, the red-shift of the surface plasmon resonance peak, as well as the drop of surface charge and the increase of the hydrodynamic diameter indicated the conjugation of proteins to NPs. Remarkably, an evolution from a loosely attached toward an irreversible attached protein corona over time was observed.

Here, we characterize the adhesion toward the cell membrane of nanoparticles of different material and size and study how this is modulated by the presence or absence of a corona on the nanoparticle surface. The results are corroborated with adsorption to simple model supported lipid bilayers using a quartz crystal microbalance. We conclude that the adsorption of proteins on the nanoparticle surface strongly reduces nanoparticle adhesion in comparison to what is observed for the bare material. Nanoparticle uptake is described as a two-step process, where the nanoparticles initially adhere to the cell membrane and subsequently are internalized by the cells via energy-dependent pathways. The lowered adhesion in the presence of proteins thereby causes a concomitant decrease in nanoparticle uptake efficiency. The presence of a biomolecular corona may confer specific interactions between the nanoparticle-corona complex and the cell surface including triggering of regulated cell uptake. An important effect of the corona is, however, a reduction in the purely unspecific interactions between the bare material and the cell membrane, which in itself disregarding specific interactions, causes a decrease in cellular uptake. We suggest that future nanoparticle-cell studies include, together with characterization of size, charge, and dispersion stability, an evaluation of the adhesion properties of the material to relevant membranes.",

Dynamic formation of protein coating around nanoparticles is a key molecular event, which may strongly impact the biological response in nanotoxicological tests. In this work, by using citrate-capped gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) of different sizes as a model, we show, by several spectroscopic techniques (dynamic light scattering, UV-visible, plasmon resonance light scattering), that proteins-NP interactions are differently mediated by two widely used cellular media (i.e., Dulbecco Modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium (RPMI), supplemented with fetal bovine serum). We found that, while DMEM elicits the formation of a large time-dependent protein corona, RPMI shows different dynamics with reduced protein coating. Characterization of these nanobioentities was also performed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and mass spectroscopy, revealing that the average composition of protein corona does not reflect the relative abundance of serum proteins. To evaluate the biological impact of such hybrid bionanostructures, several comparative viability assays onto two cell lines (HeLa and U937) were carried out in the two media, in the presence of 15 nm AuNPs. We observed that proteins/NP complexes formed in RPMI are more abundantly internalized in cells as compared to DMEM, overall exerting higher cytotoxic effects. These results show that, beyond an in-depth NPs characterization before cellular experiments, a detailed understanding of the effects elicited by cell culture media on NPs is crucial for standardized nanotoxicology tests."

The presence of the protein corona may alter the properties of the nanoparticles, with profound influences for their tissue specificity. For instance, most LNPs exhibit hepatic specificity via intravenous administration, owing to the adsorption of ApoE by binding to the LDLR that are over-expressed on the hepatocytes (Dilliard et al., 2021). Additionally, it has been validated that the knockdown of ApoE lowered the liver targeting of nanomaterials by delivering mRNA into a mouse model lacking ApoE expression (Dilliard et al., 2021). Although the mechanism of endogenous targeting is still not fully explored, researchers have striven to investigate the rules. It is discovered that when the PEG-lipids desorb from LNPs, specific protein binding to LNPs is promoted. The desorption rate of PEG-lipids with longer hydrophobic chains is slower, which might not conducive to formulating appropriate protein coronas and achieving organ targeted delivery (Dilliard et al., 2021). In parallel, nano-vectors with different structures and properties may adsorb different proteins, resulting in protein coronas with distinct components and properties. The formation of protein corona at the interface will alter the physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles, exhibiting a crucial impact on their biodistribution and endocytosis (Eygeris et al., 2021). It has been demonstrated that LNPs with different pKa values can influence their organ targeting. More specifically, the preferred pK a range for liver, spleen, and lung targeting is 6.2~6.5, 2~6, and 7~9, respectively (Dilliard et al., 2021)(Jayaraman et al., 2012)(Xiong et al., 2020).",

These vesicles are widely used in small-molecule drug and nucleic acid delivery and recently gained much attention because of their remarkable success as a delivery platform for COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. Nonetheless, the utility of transient protein expression induced by mRNA extends far beyond vaccines against infectious diseases\u2500they also hold promise as cancer vaccines, protein replacement therapies, and gene editing components for rare genetic diseases. However, naked mRNA is inherently unstable and prone to rapid degradation by nucleases and self-hydrolysis. Encapsulation of mRNA within LNPs protects mRNA from extracellular ribonucleases and assists with intracellular mRNA delivery.In this Account, we discuss the core features of LNPs for RNA delivery. We focus our attention on LNPs designed to deliver mRNA; however, we also include examples of siRNA-LNP delivery where appropriate to highlight the commonalities and the dissimilarities due to the nucleic acid structure. First, we introduce the concept of LNPs, the advantages and disadvantages of utilizing nucleic acids as therapeutic agents, and the general reasoning behind the molecular makeup of LNPs. We also briefly highlight the most recent clinical successes of LNP-based nucleic acid therapies. Second, we describe the theory and methods of LNP self-assembly. The common idea behind all of the preparation methods is inducing electrostatic interactions between the nucleic acid and charged lipids and promoting nanoparticle growth via hydrophobic interactions. Third, we break down the LNP composition with special attention to the fundamental properties and purposes of each component. This includes the identified molecular design criteria, commercial sourcing, impact on intracellular trafficking, and contribution to the properties of LNPs. One of the key components of LNPs is ionizable lipids, which initiate electrostatic binding with endosomal membranes and facilitate cytosolic release; however, the roles of other lipid components should not be disregarded, as they are associated with stability, clearance, and distribution of LNPs. Fourth, we review the attributes of LNP constructs as a whole that can heavily influence RNA delivery. These attributes are LNP size, charge, internal structure, lipid packing, lipid membrane hydration, stability, and affinity toward biomacromolecules. We also discuss the specific techniques used to examine these attributes and how they can be adjusted. Finally, we offer our perspective on the future of RNA therapies and some questions that remain in the realm of LNP formulation and optimization.",

Following intravenous injection, specific proteins in the blood are recruited to the nanoparticle\u2019s surface based on its molecular composition and they endow it with a unique biological identity that governs its ultimate fate in the body. An innovative paradigm emerges from this mechanistic understanding of nanoparticle delivery\u2014endogenous targeting\u2014wherein the molecular composition of a nanoparticle is rationally engineered to interact with specific proteins in the blood to overcome liver accumulation and to target specific organs. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a clinically mature technology for the delivery of genetic medicines but have limited therapeutic applications due to liver accumulation. Recently, our laboratory developed selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles that expand the therapeutic applications of genetic medicines by enabling delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) and gene editing systems to non-liver tissues. SORT nanoparticles include a supplemental SORT molecule whose chemical structure determines the LNP\u2019s tissue-specific activity. To understand how SORT nanoparticles surpass the delivery barrier of liver hepatocyte accumulation, we studied the mechanistic factors which define their organ-targeting properties. We discovered that the chemical nature of the added SORT molecule controlled biodistribution, global/apparent pKa, and serum protein interactions of SORT nanoparticles. Additionally, we provide evidence for an endogenous targeting mechanism whereby organ targeting occurs via 1) desorption of poly(ethylene glycol) lipids from the LNP surface, 2) binding of distinct proteins to the nanoparticle surface because of recognition of exposed SORT molecules, and 3) subsequent interactions between surface-bound proteins and cognate receptors highly expressed in specific tissues. These findings establish a crucial link between the molecular composition of SORT nanoparticles and their unique and precise organ-targeting properties and suggest that the recruitment of specific proteins to a nanoparticle\u2019s surface can enable drug delivery beyond the liver.",

These interactions result in the encapsulation of NPs by biomolecules, leading to the formation of a biomolecular corona, commonly known as the protein corona, due to its predominant enrichment with plasma proteins. Initially, it was observed that the presence of a protein corona on NPs hinders the effectiveness of targeting ligands, 23 thereby impairing the NP's targeting ability. However, it was later recognized that complete avoidance of protein corona formation, even in PEGylated systems, is not feasible. (Pozzi et al., 2014) Consequently, efforts were redirected toward harnessing the protein corona as an inherent targeting moiety, as the proteins acquired from the bloodstream could potentially serve as targeting ligands. (Caracciolo, 2015) ur research group has successfully provided direct evidence of targeted delivery of NPs by coating a cationic liposome with a protein corona enriched in vitronectin. (Caracciolo et al., 2013) This plasma protein bestowed the liposome with the remarkable ability to selectively target and bind to cancer cells that exhibit an elevated level of expression of the vitronectin receptor. A recent scientific hypothesis has suggested that the high liver tropism and transfection potency exhibited by Onpattro may be attributed to the formation of a protein corona enriched with Apo-E.

Unfortunately, opsonins are also adsorbed. These proteins are immediately recognized by the phagocyte system with rapid clearance of the NPs from the bloodstream. Polyethyleneglycol (PEG) coating of NPs (PEGylation) is the most efficient anti-opsonization strategy. Linear chains of PEG, grafted onto the NP surface, are able to create steric hindrance, resulting in a significant inhibition of protein adsorption and less recognition by macrophages. However, excessive PEGylation can lead to a strong inhibition of cellular uptake and less efficient binding with protein targets, reducing the potential of the delivery system. To reach a compromise in this regard we employed a multi-component (MC) lipid system with uncommon properties of cell uptake and endosomal escape and increasing length of PEG chains. Nano liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS/MS) analysis allowed us to accurately determine the corona composition showing that apolipoproteins are the most abundant class in the corona and that increasing the PEG length reduced the protein adsorption and the liposomal surface affinity for apolipoproteins. Due to the abundance of apolipoproteins, we exploited the \"protein corona effect\" to deliver cationic liposome-human plasma complexes to human prostate cancer PC3 cells that express a high level of scavenger receptor class B type 1 in order to evaluate the cellular uptake efficiency of the systems used. Combining laser scanning confocal microscopy with flow cytometry analysis in PC3 cells we demonstrated that MC-PEG2k is the best compromise between an anti-opsonization strategy and active targeting and could be a promising candidate to treat prostate cancer in vivo."

Initially, it was observed that the presence of a protein corona on NPs hinders the effectiveness of targeting ligands, 23 thereby impairing the NP's targeting ability. However, it was later recognized that complete avoidance of protein corona formation, even in PEGylated systems, is not feasible. (Pozzi et al., 2014) Consequently, efforts were redirected toward harnessing the protein corona as an inherent targeting moiety, as the proteins acquired from the bloodstream could potentially serve as targeting ligands. (Caracciolo, 2015) ur research group has successfully provided direct evidence of targeted delivery of NPs by coating a cationic liposome with a protein corona enriched in vitronectin. (Caracciolo et al., 2013) This plasma protein bestowed the liposome with the remarkable ability to selectively target and bind to cancer cells that exhibit an elevated level of expression of the vitronectin receptor. A recent scientific hypothesis has suggested that the high liver tropism and transfection potency exhibited by Onpattro may be attributed to the formation of a protein corona enriched with Apo-E. (Akinc et al., 2019) This protein corona, in turn, enables the recognition of hepatocytes through the LDL receptor, potentially contributing to its liver-targeting capabilities."

To improve their efficacy, a better understanding is required regarding how LNPs are trapped and processed at the anionic endosomal membrane prior to mRNA release. We used surface-sensitive fluorescence microscopy with single LNP resolution to investigate the pH dependency of the binding kinetics of ionizable lipid-containing LNPs to a supported endosomal model membrane. A sharp increase of LNP binding was observed when the pH was lowered from 6 to 5, accompanied by stepwise large-scale LNP disintegration. For LNPs preincubated in serum, protein corona formation shifted the onset of LNP binding and subsequent disintegration to lower pH, an effect that was less pronounced for lipoprotein-depleted serum. The LNP binding to the endosomal membrane mimic was observed to eventually become severely limited by suppression of the driving force for the formation of multivalent bonds during LNP attachment or, more specifically, by charge neutralization of anionic lipids in the model membrane due to their association with cationic lipids from earlier attached LNPs upon their disintegration. Cell uptake experiments demonstrated marginal differences in LNP uptake in untreated and lipoprotein-depleted serum, whereas lipoprotein-depleted serum increased mRNA-controlled protein (eGFP) production substantially. This complies with model membrane data and suggests that protein corona formation on the surface of the LNPs influences the nature of the interaction between LNPs and endosomal membranes."

Nonetheless, the therapeutic effects of systemically administered anti-VEGF antibodies are often hindered in NSCLCs because of their limited distribution in the lungs and their adverse effects on normal tissues. These challenges can be overcome by delivering therapeutic antibodies in their mRNA form to lung endothelial cells, a primary target of VEGF-mediated pulmonary angiogenesis, to suppress the NSCLCs. In this study, we synthesized derivatives of poly(\u03b2-amino esters) (PBAEs) and prepared nanoparticles to encapsulate the synthetic mRNA encoding bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF antibody used in the clinic. Optimization of nanoparticle formulations resulted in a selective lung transfection after intravenous administration. Notably, the optimized PBAE nanoparticles were distributed in lung endothelial cells, resulting in the secretion of bevacizumab. We analyzed the protein corona on the lung- and spleen-targeting nanoparticles using proteomics and found distinctive features potentially contributing to their organ-selectivity. Lastly, bevacizumab mRNA delivered by the lung-targeting PBAE nanoparticles more significantly inhibited tumor proliferation and angiogenesis than recombinant bevacizumab protein in orthotopic NSCLC mouse models, supporting the therapeutic potential of bevacizumab mRNA therapy and its selective delivery through lung-targeting nanoparticles. Our proof-of-principle results highlight the clinical benefits of nanoparticle-mediated mRNA therapy in anticancer antibody treatment in preclinical models."

Using the approach and concepts of physical chemistry, we relate studies on the composition of the protein corona at different plasma concentrations with structural data on the complexes both in situ and free from excess plasma. This enables a high degree of confidence in the meaning of the hard protein corona in a biological context.

NP-protein complexes are characterized by differential centrifugal sedimentation, dynamic light scattering, and zeta-potential both in situ and once isolated from plasma as a function of the protein/NP surface area ratio. We then introduce a semiquantitative determination of their hard corona composition using one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrospray liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, which allows us to follow the total binding isotherms for the particles, identifying simultaneously the nature and amount of the most relevant proteins as a function of the plasma concentration.

Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a clinically mature technology for the delivery of genetic medicines but have limited therapeutic applications due to liver accumulation. Recently, our laboratory developed selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles that expand the therapeutic applications of genetic medicines by enabling delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) and gene editing systems to non-liver tissues. SORT nanoparticles include a supplemental SORT molecule whose chemical structure determines the LNP\u2019s tissue-specific activity. To understand how SORT nanoparticles surpass the delivery barrier of liver hepatocyte accumulation, we studied the mechanistic factors which define their organ-targeting properties. We discovered that the chemical nature of the added SORT molecule controlled biodistribution, global/apparent pKa, and serum protein interactions of SORT nanoparticles. Additionally, we provide evidence for an endogenous targeting mechanism whereby organ targeting occurs via 1) desorption of poly(ethylene glycol) lipids from the LNP surface, 2) binding of distinct proteins to the nanoparticle surface because of recognition of exposed SORT molecules, and 3) subsequent interactions between surface-bound proteins and cognate receptors highly expressed in specific tissues. These findings establish a crucial link between the molecular composition of SORT nanoparticles and their unique and precise organ-targeting properties and suggest that the recruitment of specific proteins to a nanoparticle\u2019s surface can enable drug delivery beyond the liver."

This corona is commonly known as protein corona (PC) due to the predominant presence of plasma proteins (Amici et al., 2023). The PC formation is a spontaneous process that occurs rapidly thanks to noncovalent interactions between proteins and the LNP surface (Tomak et al., 2021). \n\nThe presence of PC influences many properties of LNPs such as surface charge, hydrophilic and hydrophobic characteristics, stability, targeting ability, aggregation phenomena, toxicity, and efficacy, and, when RNA or DNA are loaded in LNPs, the PC affected also their transfection efficiency (Simonsen, 2024)(Renzi et al., 2024). Data published on PC-coated LNPs seem to conflict with each other; in fact, many researchers observed a reduction in the targeting ability of nanoparticles after the PC formation (Salvati et al., 2013), an increase in LNP aggregation, a decrease in LNP stability, and the leakage of fluorophores used for LNP tracking in vivo (Francia et al., 2020) (Figure 6), while other researchers suggested that the PC formation could be favorable to obtain a specific LNP targeting (Qiu et al., 2022). \n\nThe PC composition is principally affected by the physico-chemical properties and the biological environment of LNPs; it is also important to underline that the administration of the same LNP formulation to different patients could result in a different interaction of LNP-PC, specific for everyone (depending, as example, on pathological conditions, gender, age, and administration site) (Lundqvist et al., 2017)(Straten et al., 2024).",

To efficiently deliver the nucleic acid payload to its target tissue, the genetic material needs to be combined with a delivery platform. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have proven to be excellent delivery vectors for gene therapy and are increasingly entering into routine clinical practice. Over the past two decades, the optimization of LNP formulations for nucleic acid delivery has led to a well-established body of knowledge culminating in the first-ever RNA interference therapeutic using LNP technology, i.e. Onpattro\u00ae, and many more in clinical development to deliver various nucleic acid payloads. Screening a lipid library in vivo for optimal gene silencing potency in hepatocytes resulted in the identification of the Onpattro\u00ae formulation. Subsequent studies discovered that the key to Onpattro\u00ae's liver tropism is its ability to form a specific \"biomolecular corona\". In fact, apolipoprotein E (ApoE), among other proteins, adsorbed to the LNP surface enables specific hepatocyte targeting. This proof-of-principle example demonstrates the use of the biomolecular corona for targeting specific receptors and cells, thereby opening up the road to rationally designing LNPs. To date, however, only a few studies have explored in detail the corona of LNPs and how to efficiently modulate the corona remains poorly understood. In this review, we summarize recent discoveries about the biomolecular corona, expanding the knowledge gained with other nanoparticles to LNPs for nucleic acid delivery. In particular, we address how particle stability, biodistribution, and targeting of LNPs can be influenced by the biological environment. Onpattro\u00ae is used as a case study to describe both the successful development of an LNP formulation for gene therapy and the key influence of the biological environment. Moreover, we outline the techniques available to isolate and analyze the corona of LNPs, and we highlight their advantages and drawbacks. Finally, we discuss possible implications of the biomolecular corona for LNP delivery and we examine the potential of exploiting the corona as a targeting strategy beyond the liver to develop next-generation gene therapies.",

However, there is still a lack of clarity about the relationships between physiological conditions and corona composition over time, and how this controls biological activities/interactions. Here we review recent progress in characterizing the structure and composition of protein corona as a function of biological fluid and time. We summarize the influence of nanoparticle characteristics on protein corona composition and discuss the relevance of protein corona to the biological activity and fate of nanoparticles. The aim is to provide a critical summary of the key factors that affect protein corona formation (e.g. characteristics of nanoparticles and biological environment) and how the corona modulates biological activity, cellular uptake, biodistribution, and drug delivery. In addition to a discussion on the importance of the characterization of protein corona adsorbed on nanoparticle surfaces under conditions that mimic relevant physiological environment, we discuss the unresolved technical issues related to the characterization of nanoparticle-protein corona complexes during their journey in the body. Lastly, the paper offers a perspective on how the existing nanomaterial toxicity data obtained from in vitro studies should be reconsidered in the light of the presence of a protein corona, and how recent advances in fields, such as proteomics and machine learning can be integrated into the quantitative analysis of protein corona components.",

Here, we have developed a library of N-series lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) that could specifically regulate the protein composition of protein corona on the surface of LNPs, which allows specific delivery of mRNA to the lung. We further demonstrated that our lung-targeting LNP could effectively deliver mouse tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (Tsc2) mRNA into TSC2-null cells and restore its function, resulting in enhanced control of tumor burden in a preclinical model of lymphangioleiomyomatosis, a destructive lung disease caused by loss-of-function mutations in the Tsc2 gene. Safe and efficacious systemic delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) to specific organs and cells in vivo remains the major challenge in the development of mRNA-based therapeutics. Targeting of systemically administered lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) coformulated with mRNA has largely been confined to the liver and spleen. Using a library screening approach, we identified that N-series LNPs (containing an amide bond in the tail) are capable of selectively delivering mRNA to the mouse lung, in contrast to our previous discovery that O-series LNPs (containing an ester bond in the tail) that tend to deliver mRNA to the liver. We analyzed the protein corona on the liver- and lung-targeted LNPs using liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry and identified a group of unique plasma proteins specifically absorbed onto the surface that may contribute to the targetability of these LNPs. Different pulmonary cell types can also be targeted by simply tuning the headgroup structure of N-series LNPs. Importantly, we demonstrate here the success of LNP-based RNA therapy in a preclinical model of lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), a destructive lung disease caused by loss-of-function mutations in the Tsc2 gene. Our lung-targeting LNP exhibited highly efficient delivery of the mouse tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (Tsc2) mRNA for the restoration of TSC2 tumor suppressor in tumor and achieved remarkable therapeutic effect in reducing tumor burden. This research establishes mRNA LNPs as a promising therapeutic intervention for the treatment of LAM.",

Biological fluids have complex compositions and the molecular components interact and function together in intricate networks. Therefore, the process to isolate blood or the preparation of blood derivatives may lead to differences in the composition of the identified protein corona around nanoparticles. Here, we show distinct differences in the protein corona formed in whole blood, whole blood with EDTA, plasma, or serum. Furthermore, the ratio between particle surface area to protein concentration influences the detected corona. We also show that the nanoparticle size per se influences the formed protein corona due to curvature effects. These results emphasize the need of investigating the formation and biological importance of the protein corona in the same environment as the nanoparticles are intended for or released into."

This corona is commonly known as protein corona (PC) due to the predominant presence of plasma proteins (Amici et al., 2023). The PC formation is a spontaneous process that occurs rapidly thanks to noncovalent interactions between proteins and the LNP surface (Tomak et al., 2021). \n\nThe presence of PC influences many properties of LNPs such as surface charge, hydrophilic and hydrophobic characteristics, stability, targeting ability, aggregation phenomena, toxicity, and efficacy, and, when RNA or DNA are loaded in LNPs, the PC affected also their transfection efficiency (Simonsen, 2024)(Renzi et al., 2024). Data published on PC-coated LNPs seem to conflict with each other; in fact, many researchers observed a reduction in the targeting ability of nanoparticles after the PC formation (Salvati et al., 2013), an increase in LNP aggregation, a decrease in LNP stability, and the leakage of fluorophores used for LNP tracking in vivo (Francia et al., 2020) (Figure 6), while other researchers suggested that the PC formation could be favorable to obtain a specific LNP targeting (Qiu et al., 2022). \n\nThe PC composition is principally affected by the physico-chemical properties and the biological environment of LNPs; it is also important to underline that the administration of the same LNP formulation to different patients could result in a different interaction of LNP-PC, specific for everyone (depending, as example, on pathological conditions, gender, age, and administration site) (Lundqvist et al., 2017)(Straten et al., 2024)."

The functional mapping of opsonins and dysopsonins is instrumental to design long-circulating and nanotoxicologically safe next-generation nanotheranostics. In this review, we critically analyze functional data identifying specific proteins with opsonin or dysopsonin properties. Special attention is dedicated to the following: (1) the simplicity or complexity of the NP proteome and its modulation, (2) the role of specific host proteins in mediating the stealth properties of uncoated or polymer-coated NPs, and (3) the ability of the innate immune system, and, in particular, of the complement proteins, to mediate NP clearance by phagocytes. Emerging species-specific peculiarities, differentiating humans from preclinical animal models (the murine especially), are highlighted throughout this overview. The operative definition of opsonin and dysopsonin and the measurement schemes to assess their in vitro efficacy is critically re-examined.

The physicochemical assay was held in water HPLC-grade and Foetal Bovine Serum (FBS), in order to determine whether these systems can be used as drug or antigen delivery nanosystems. Dynamic and electrophoretic light scattering (DLS/ELS) techniques were used for the measurement of the hydrodynamic diameter, the polydispersity index, and the \u03b6-potential of the prepared nanosystems. The incorporation of the P407 resulted in a size reduction of all systems. A decrease in the hydrodynamic diameter and polydispersity index were also found as a result of increasing the storage temperature from 4\u2009\u00b0C to 25\u2009\u00b0C, attributed to P407. The experiments that were carried out in FBS, showed that the addition of P407 improved systems stealth properties. Concluding, we propose P407 as a promising alternative to PEG in the development of lipid nanoparticles with optimized bio- and shelf-stability."

To efficiently deliver the nucleic acid payload to its target tissue, the genetic material needs to be combined with a delivery platform. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have proven to be excellent delivery vectors for gene therapy and are increasingly entering into routine clinical practice. Over the past two decades, the optimization of LNP formulations for nucleic acid delivery has led to a well-established body of knowledge culminating in the first-ever RNA interference therapeutic using LNP technology, i.e. Onpattro\u00ae, and many more in clinical development to deliver various nucleic acid payloads. Screening a lipid library in vivo for optimal gene silencing potency in hepatocytes resulted in the identification of the Onpattro\u00ae formulation. Subsequent studies discovered that the key to Onpattro\u00ae's liver tropism is its ability to form a specific \"biomolecular corona\". In fact, apolipoprotein E (ApoE), among other proteins, adsorbed to the LNP surface enables specific hepatocyte targeting. This proof-of-principle example demonstrates the use of the biomolecular corona for targeting specific receptors and cells, thereby opening up the road to rationally designing LNPs. To date, however, only a few studies have explored in detail the corona of LNPs and how to efficiently modulate the corona remains poorly understood. In this review, we summarize recent discoveries about the biomolecular corona, expanding the knowledge gained with other nanoparticles to LNPs for nucleic acid delivery. In particular, we address how particle stability, biodistribution, and targeting of LNPs can be influenced by the biological environment. Onpattro\u00ae is used as a case study to describe both the successful development of an LNP formulation for gene therapy and the key influence of the biological environment. Moreover, we outline the techniques available to isolate and analyze the corona of LNPs, and we highlight their advantages and drawbacks. Finally, we discuss possible implications of the biomolecular corona for LNP delivery and we examine the potential of exploiting the corona as a targeting strategy beyond the liver to develop next-generation gene therapies."

This protein coating significantly alters the \"biological identity\" of LNPs, which differs from their original \"synthetic identity\" and ultimately determines how these nanoparticles interact with cells and tissues. The protein corona typically forms within seconds to minutes after exposure to biological fluids and evolves over time, with high-affinity proteins eventually displacing those with lower affinity (the Vroman effect). The corona consists of two layers: a tightly bound \"hard\" corona of high-affinity proteins and a loosely associated \"soft\" corona that exchanges more rapidly with the environment. For LNPs, which have emerged as crucial delivery systems for nucleic acid therapeutics including mRNA vaccines, the protein corona directly influences critical functional properties including cellular uptake, endosomal escape, biodistribution, circulation time, and immunogenicity. The specific design features of LNPs\u2014including lipid composition, surface chemistry, PEGylation, and particle size\u2014all play determinative roles in which proteins adsorb to the nanoparticle surface and how they are arranged, ultimately affecting the therapeutic efficacy and safety profile of LNP-based medicines. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">",

When LNPs encounter biological fluids, their lipid components determine which proteins adsorb to their surface, ultimately affecting their biological fate and tissue tropism.

While their primary function is to complex with nucleic acids, they likely participate in protein adsorption and apolipoprotein E (ApoE) corona formation on the LNP surface <Paper corpusId=\"250244349\" paperTitle=\"(Albertsen et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. The incorporation of different helper lipids also influences protein adsorption patterns; for instance, phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)-based helper lipids differentially affect ApoE adsorption, consequently impacting hepatic delivery <Paper corpusId=\"268690018\" paperTitle=\"(Vaidya et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe surface charge of LNPs, modulated by lipid composition, has emerged as a key determinant of protein corona formation and subsequent organ targeting. Research has shown that introducing charged lipids can alter the apparent pKa of LNPs, which in turn affects their interaction with plasma proteins <Paper corpusId=\"273570097\" paperTitle=\"(Vasileva et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.

However, it is currently impossible to rationally design nanoparticles that selectively target specific tissues. Here, we report a strategy termed selective organ targeting (SORT) wherein multiple classes of lipid nanoparticles are systematically engineered to exclusively edit extrahepatic tissues via addition of a supplemental SORT molecule. Lung-, spleen- and liver-targeted SORT lipid nanoparticles were designed to selectively edit therapeutically relevant cell types including epithelial cells, endothelial cells, B cells, T cells and hepatocytes. SORT is compatible with multiple gene editing techniques, including mRNA, Cas9 mRNA/single guide RNA and Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complexes, and is envisioned to aid the development of protein replacement and gene correction therapeutics in targeted tissues. The addition of selective organ targeting molecules to nanoparticles allows the specific targeting of extrahepatic tissues, enabling gene editing of distinct cell populations outside the liver."

                            "Significance Liver accumulation represents a significant barrier in the development of therapeutically efficacious nanoparticle drug delivery systems. Using a series of lipid nanoparticles with distinct organ-targeting properties, we provide evidence for a plausible mechanism of action for nanoparticle delivery to non-liver tissues. Following intravenous injection, specific proteins in the blood are recruited to the nanoparticle\u2019s surface based on its molecular composition and they endow it with a unique biological identity that governs its ultimate fate in the body. An innovative paradigm emerges from this mechanistic understanding of nanoparticle delivery\u2014endogenous targeting\u2014wherein the molecular composition of a nanoparticle is rationally engineered to interact with specific proteins in the blood to overcome liver accumulation and to target specific organs. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a clinically mature technology for the delivery of genetic medicines but have limited therapeutic applications due to liver accumulation. Recently, our laboratory developed selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles that expand the therapeutic applications of genetic medicines by enabling delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) and gene editing systems to non-liver tissues. SORT nanoparticles include a supplemental SORT molecule whose chemical structure determines the LNP\u2019s tissue-specific activity. To understand how SORT nanoparticles surpass the delivery barrier of liver hepatocyte accumulation, we studied the mechanistic factors which define their organ-targeting properties. We discovered that the chemical nature of the added SORT molecule controlled biodistribution, global/apparent pKa, and serum protein interactions of SORT nanoparticles. Additionally, we provide evidence for an endogenous targeting mechanism whereby organ targeting occurs via 1) desorption of poly(ethylene glycol) lipids from the LNP surface, 2) binding of distinct proteins to the nanoparticle surface because of recognition of exposed SORT molecules, and 3) subsequent interactions between surface-bound proteins and cognate receptors highly expressed in specific tissues. These findings establish a crucial link between the molecular composition of SORT nanoparticles and their unique and precise organ-targeting properties and suggest that the recruitment of specific proteins to a nanoparticle\u2019s surface can enable drug delivery beyond the liver."

                            "The protein corona phenomenon, mainly influenced by the surface properties of LNPs, has become popular among researchers in the field of nanosized drug delivery systems. After the administration of LNPs, serum proteins are adsorbed on the surface of the nanoparticles evidently, forming a protein corona. This corona may impede targeted efficacy by shielding surface ligands necessary for specific cell or receptor recognition. Surface-exposed PEGylated lipids play a crucial role in determining and regulating the composition of the corona proteins on LNPs. Parallelly, the compositions of the corona proteins can govern the distributions of the nanoparticles due to the organ-specific accumulations of the serum proteins, such as ApoE for the liver and complementary system-related proteins for the spleen.\n\nIn a recent study, Chen et al. [70] investigated the role of apolipoprotein-and vitronectin-enriched corona on LNPs for targeted delivery and transfection of oligonucleotides in murine tumor models. A slight change in the physicochemical properties of LNPs altered the corona pattern. For instance, the introduction of positive charge via cationic lipid 3\u03b2-{N-[2-(dimethylamino) ethyl]carbamoyl}cholesterol (DC-cholesterol) as a substitution for original cholesterol shifted the protein corona pattern from apolipoprotein-rich to vitronectin-rich. In the aspect of transfection performance, nanoparticles with apolipoproteinrich corona showed better delivery to hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) as compared to those with vitronectin-rich corona. LNPs formulated with PEG-conjugated C18 lipids (either 3% or 6% molar ratio) were proved to be optimal for in vivo delivery to HepG2 tumor. The study revealed that the composition of the protein corona influenced the biodistribution and targeting efficiency of LNPs, highlighting the complex interplay between nanoparticle surface properties, including surface-coating PEG, protein interactions, and in vivo performance.\n\nIn the case of LNPs, PEG length and alkyl chain affect both surface chemistry and PEG shedding rate [67], thereby influencing the surface coronation and targeting tissues."

                            "Gene therapy holds great potential for treating almost any disease by gene silencing, protein expression, or gene correction. To efficiently deliver the nucleic acid payload to its target tissue, the genetic material needs to be combined with a delivery platform. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have proven to be excellent delivery vectors for gene therapy and are increasingly entering into routine clinical practice. Over the past two decades, the optimization of LNP formulations for nucleic acid delivery has led to a well-established body of knowledge culminating in the first-ever RNA interference therapeutic using LNP technology, i.e. Onpattro\u00ae, and many more in clinical development to deliver various nucleic acid payloads. Screening a lipid library in vivo for optimal gene silencing potency in hepatocytes resulted in the identification of the Onpattro\u00ae formulation. Subsequent studies discovered that the key to Onpattro\u00ae's liver tropism is its ability to form a specific \"biomolecular corona\". In fact, apolipoprotein E (ApoE), among other proteins, adsorbed to the LNP surface enables specific hepatocyte targeting. This proof-of-principle example demonstrates the use of the biomolecular corona for targeting specific receptors and cells, thereby opening up the road to rationally designing LNPs. To date, however, only a few studies have explored in detail the corona of LNPs and how to efficiently modulate the corona remains poorly understood. In this review, we summarize recent discoveries about the biomolecular corona, expanding the knowledge gained with other nanoparticles to LNPs for nucleic acid delivery. In particular, we address how particle stability, biodistribution, and targeting of LNPs can be influenced by the biological environment. Onpattro\u00ae is used as a case study to describe both the successful development of an LNP formulation for gene therapy and the key influence of the biological environment. Moreover, we outline the techniques available to isolate and analyze the corona of LNPs, and we highlight their advantages and drawbacks. Finally, we discuss possible implications of the biomolecular corona for LNP delivery and we examine the potential of exploiting the corona as a targeting strategy beyond the liver to develop next-generation gene therapies."

For instance, more hydrophobic surface ligands tend to attract proteins with higher surface hydrophobicity and form more dynamic coronas with faster protein exchange rates <Paper corpusId=\"31345982\" paperTitle=\"(Ashby et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>. Similarly, chiral surfaces can influence not only which proteins adsorb but also their orientation and conformation, which subsequently affects receptor recognition and cellular interactions <Paper corpusId=\"32343932\" paperTitle=\"(Wang et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>. These findings highlight how subtle differences in surface chemistry can profoundly impact biological outcomes.\n\nThe presence of a protein corona generally reduces nanoparticle adhesion to cell membranes compared to bare particles, consequently affecting cellular uptake efficiency <Paper corpusId=\"7805637\" paperTitle=\"(Lesniak et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper>. This reduced adhesion represents a fundamental mechanism by which the protein corona modulates nanoparticle-cell interactions, regardless of specific molecular targeting. However, the composition of the corona can lead to different mechanisms of cellular internalization, as demonstrated by studies showing that nanoparticles with different corona compositions can be recognized differently by cell receptors and consequently follow distinct uptake pathways <Paper corpusId=\"202673667\" paperTitle=\"(Francia et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe type of biological fluid also significantly influences corona formation. Research has shown distinct differences in protein corona composition when nanoparticles are exposed to whole blood, plasma, or serum, and even different cell culture media can elicit dramatically different protein corona profiles <Paper corpusId=\"9085989\" paperTitle=\"(Maiorano et al., 2010)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"274333034\" paperTitle=\"(Catenacci et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.

Additionally, the corona profile can be influenced by ambient factors such as biomolecule concentration, pH, ionic strength, temperature and incubation time. Upon corona formation, the identity of the NP is transformed; its physicochemical properties, targeting abilities and biological responses change owing to the surrogated biological identity dictated by the adsorbed proteins. For example, characterization of the protein corona on core-shell NPs, composed of identical PEGylated lipid bilayer shells with varying core elasticities, revealed that apolipoprotein A1 preferentially adsorbs onto NPs with intermediate elasticity and the adsorption strongly correlates with longer NP elasticity-dependent in vivo systemic circulation lifetimes."

Under in vitro cell culture conditions, zeta potential measurements, UV-vis spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscope analysis were used to monitor the time evolution of the inorganic NP-protein corona formation and to characterize the stability of the NPs and their surface state at every stage of the experiment. As expected, the red-shift of the surface plasmon resonance peak, as well as the drop of surface charge and the increase of the hydrodynamic diameter indicated the conjugation of proteins to NPs. Remarkably, an evolution from a loosely attached toward an irreversible attached protein corona over time was observed. Mass spectrometry of the digested protein corona revealed albumin as the most abundant component which suggests an improved biocompatibility."

                            "Upon intravenous injection, the nanoparticles come into contact with the serum, leading proteins to adsorb on their surface and form a distinctive protein corona layer (Dilliard et al., 2021). The presence of the protein corona may alter the properties of the nanoparticles, with profound influences for their tissue specificity. For instance, most LNPs exhibit hepatic specificity via intravenous administration, owing to the adsorption of ApoE by binding to the LDLR that are over-expressed on the hepatocytes (Dilliard et al., 2021). Additionally, it has been validated that the knockdown of ApoE lowered the liver targeting of nanomaterials by delivering mRNA into a mouse model lacking ApoE expression (Dilliard et al., 2021). Although the mechanism of endogenous targeting is still not fully explored, researchers have striven to investigate the rules. It is discovered that when the PEG-lipids desorb from LNPs, specific protein binding to LNPs is promoted. The desorption rate of PEG-lipids with longer hydrophobic chains is slower, which might not conducive to formulating appropriate protein coronas and achieving organ targeted delivery (Dilliard et al., 2021). In parallel, nano-vectors with different structures and properties may adsorb different proteins, resulting in protein coronas with distinct components and properties. The formation of protein corona at the interface will alter the physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles, exhibiting a crucial impact on their biodistribution and endocytosis (Eygeris et al., 2021). It has been demonstrated that LNPs with different pKa values can influence their organ targeting. More specifically, the preferred pK a range for liver, spleen, and lung targeting is 6.2~6.5, 2~6, and 7~9, respectively (Dilliard et al., 2021)(Jayaraman et al., 2012)(Xiong et al., 2020)."

                            "Nanoparticles (NPs) adsorb proteins when in the biological matrix, and the resulted protein corona could affect NP-cell interactions. The corona has a dynamic nature with the adsorbed proteins constantly exchanging with the free proteins in the matrix at various rates. The rapidly exchanging proteins compose the soft corona, which responds more dynamically to environment changes than the hard corona established by the ones with slow exchange rates. In the present study, the corona formed on the superparamagnetic iron oxide NPs (SPIONs) in human serum was studied by flow field-flow fractionation and ultracentrifugation, which rapidly differentiated the corona proteins based on their exchange rates. By varying the surface hydrophobicity of the SPIONs with a core size around 10 nm, we found out that, the more hydrophobic surface ligand attracted proteins with higher surface hydrophobicity and formed a more dynamic corona with a larger portion of the involved proteins with fast exchange rates. Increasing the core diameter of the SPIONs but keeping the surface ligand the same could also result in a more dynamic corona. A brief investigation of the effect on the cellular uptake of SPIONs using one selected corona protein, transferrin, was conducted. The result showed that, only the stably bound transferrin could significantly enhance cellular uptake, while transferrin bound in a dynamic nature had negligible impact. Our study has led to a better understanding of the relationship between the particle properties and the dynamic nature of the corona, which can help with design of nanomaterials with higher biocompatibility and higher efficacy in biosystems for biomedical applications."

                            "When nanoparticles are exposed to a physiological environment, a \"protein corona\" is formed that greatly determines their biological fate. Adsorption of proteins could be influenced by chiral surfaces of nanoparticles; however, very few quantitative studies are available on the interaction of protein with the chiral surface of nanoparticles, and the underlying mechanism remains largely unresolved. We have developed a strategy to quantitatively analyze the adsorption and conformational features of transferrin on gold nanoparticles that are functionalized with d, l, and racemic penicillamine. We used a quartz microbalance platform to monitor the interaction of the adsorbed transferrin with transferrin receptors in HEK cell-derived liposomes. Results show that the chiral surface of nanoparticle determines the orientation and conformation of transferrin, which subsequently affects the interaction and recognition of transferrin with its receptor on the cellular membrane. Transferrin is widely used as a tumor-targeting ligand in cancer treatment and diagnosis since the transferrin receptor is overexpressed on the cell membrane of various types of cancer cells. Thus, the present results will help to expand the knowledge on biological identity of nanoparticles with chiral surfaces in a physiological environment and provide an insight into the rational design of therapeutic nanoparticles."

                            "The interactions between nanosized particles and living systems are commonly mediated by what adsorbs to the nanoparticle in the biological environment, its biomolecular corona, rather than the pristine surface. Here, we characterize the adhesion toward the cell membrane of nanoparticles of different material and size and study how this is modulated by the presence or absence of a corona on the nanoparticle surface. The results are corroborated with adsorption to simple model supported lipid bilayers using a quartz crystal microbalance. We conclude that the adsorption of proteins on the nanoparticle surface strongly reduces nanoparticle adhesion in comparison to what is observed for the bare material. Nanoparticle uptake is described as a two-step process, where the nanoparticles initially adhere to the cell membrane and subsequently are internalized by the cells via energy-dependent pathways. The lowered adhesion in the presence of proteins thereby causes a concomitant decrease in nanoparticle uptake efficiency. The presence of a biomolecular corona may confer specific interactions between the nanoparticle-corona complex and the cell surface including triggering of regulated cell uptake. An important effect of the corona is, however, a reduction in the purely unspecific interactions between the bare material and the cell membrane, which in itself disregarding specific interactions, causes a decrease in cellular uptake. We suggest that future nanoparticle-cell studies include, together with characterization of size, charge, and dispersion stability, an evaluation of the adhesion properties of the material to relevant membranes."

                            "Nanosized objects, such as nanoparticles and other drug carriers used in nanomedicine, once in contact with biological environments are modified by adsorption of biomolecules on their surface. The presence of this corona strongly affects the following interactions at cell and organism levels. It has been shown that corona proteins can be recognized by cell receptors. However, it is not known whether the composition of this acquired layer can also affect the mechanisms nanoparticles use to enter cells. This is of particular importance when considering that the same nanoparticles can form different coronas for instance in vitro when exposed to cells in different serum amounts or in vivo depending on the exposure or administration route. Thus, in this work, different coronas were formed on 50 nm silica by exposing them to different serum concentrations. The uptake efficiency in HeLa cells was compared, and the uptake mechanisms were characterized using transport inhibitors and RNA interference. The results showed that the nanoparticles were internalized by cells via different mechanisms when different coronas were formed, and only for one corona condition was uptake mediated by the LDL receptor. This suggested that coronas of different composition can be recognized differently by cell receptors, and this in turn leads to internalization via different mechanisms. Similar studies were performed using other cells, including A549 cells and primary HUVEC, and different nanoparticles, namely 100 nm liposomes and 200 nm silica. Overall, the results confirmed that the corona composition can affect the mechanisms of nanoparticle uptake by cells."

                            "The development of appropriate in vitro protocols to assess the potential toxicity of the ever expanding range of nanoparticles represents a challenging issue, because of the rapid changes of their intrinsic physicochemical properties (size, shape, reactivity, surface area, etc.) upon dispersion in biological fluids. Dynamic formation of protein coating around nanoparticles is a key molecular event, which may strongly impact the biological response in nanotoxicological tests. In this work, by using citrate-capped gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) of different sizes as a model, we show, by several spectroscopic techniques (dynamic light scattering, UV-visible, plasmon resonance light scattering), that proteins-NP interactions are differently mediated by two widely used cellular media (i.e., Dulbecco Modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium (RPMI), supplemented with fetal bovine serum). We found that, while DMEM elicits the formation of a large time-dependent protein corona, RPMI shows different dynamics with reduced protein coating. Characterization of these nanobioentities was also performed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and mass spectroscopy, revealing that the average composition of protein corona does not reflect the relative abundance of serum proteins. To evaluate the biological impact of such hybrid bionanostructures, several comparative viability assays onto two cell lines (HeLa and U937) were carried out in the two media, in the presence of 15 nm AuNPs. We observed that proteins/NP complexes formed in RPMI are more abundantly internalized in cells as compared to DMEM, overall exerting higher cytotoxic effects. These results show that, beyond an in-depth NPs characterization before cellular experiments, a detailed understanding of the effects elicited by cell culture media on NPs is crucial for standardized nanotoxicology tests."

                            "When NPs enter the bloodstream, some biomolecules interact with the LNP surface, resulting in their encapsulation and leading to the formation of a corona. This corona is commonly known as protein corona (PC) due to the predominant presence of plasma proteins (Amici et al., 2023). The PC formation is a spontaneous process that occurs rapidly thanks to noncovalent interactions between proteins and the LNP surface (Tomak et al., 2021). \n\nThe presence of PC influences many properties of LNPs such as surface charge, hydrophilic and hydrophobic characteristics, stability, targeting ability, aggregation phenomena, toxicity, and efficacy, and, when RNA or DNA are loaded in LNPs, the PC affected also their transfection efficiency (Simonsen, 2024)(Renzi et al., 2024). Data published on PC-coated LNPs seem to conflict with each other; in fact, many researchers observed a reduction in the targeting ability of nanoparticles after the PC formation (Salvati et al., 2013), an increase in LNP aggregation, a decrease in LNP stability, and the leakage of fluorophores used for LNP tracking in vivo (Francia et al., 2020) (Figure 6), while other researchers suggested that the PC formation could be favorable to obtain a specific LNP targeting (Qiu et al., 2022). \n\nThe PC composition is principally affected by the physico-chemical properties and the biological environment of LNPs; it is also important to underline that the administration of the same LNP formulation to different patients could result in a different interaction of LNP-PC, specific for everyone (depending, as example, on pathological conditions, gender, age, and administration site) (Lundqvist et al., 2017)(Straten et al., 2024)."

In a recent study, Le ND et al. synthesized a series of poly(\u03b2-amino ester) (PBAE) derivatives and found that the protein corona on nanoparticles could help achieve organ targeting (lungs and spleen) (Le et al., 2024). Interestingly, their findings correlated closely with the study of Min Qiu et al. [33] , which demonstrated that the protein corona on lung-targeted nanoparticles had distinct characteristics that promoted lung accumulation. The protein corona formed on the surface of liposomes is primarily influenced by the physicochemical properties of the liposomes themselves. By selecting different lipid components or varying their ratios, it is possible to achieve targeting of different organs or cells."

                            "Therapeutic antibodies that block vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) show clinical benefits in treating nonsmall cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) by inhibiting tumor angiogenesis. Nonetheless, the therapeutic effects of systemically administered anti-VEGF antibodies are often hindered in NSCLCs because of their limited distribution in the lungs and their adverse effects on normal tissues. These challenges can be overcome by delivering therapeutic antibodies in their mRNA form to lung endothelial cells, a primary target of VEGF-mediated pulmonary angiogenesis, to suppress the NSCLCs. In this study, we synthesized derivatives of poly(\u03b2-amino esters) (PBAEs) and prepared nanoparticles to encapsulate the synthetic mRNA encoding bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF antibody used in the clinic. Optimization of nanoparticle formulations resulted in a selective lung transfection after intravenous administration. Notably, the optimized PBAE nanoparticles were distributed in lung endothelial cells, resulting in the secretion of bevacizumab. We analyzed the protein corona on the lung- and spleen-targeting nanoparticles using proteomics and found distinctive features potentially contributing to their organ-selectivity. Lastly, bevacizumab mRNA delivered by the lung-targeting PBAE nanoparticles more significantly inhibited tumor proliferation and angiogenesis than recombinant bevacizumab protein in orthotopic NSCLC mouse models, supporting the therapeutic potential of bevacizumab mRNA therapy and its selective delivery through lung-targeting nanoparticles. Our proof-of-principle results highlight the clinical benefits of nanoparticle-mediated mRNA therapy in anticancer antibody treatment in preclinical models."

                            "Significance The current application of messenger RNA (mRNA)-based technology has largely been confined to liver diseases because of the lack of a specific and efficient extrahepatic in vivo systemic mRNA delivery system. Here, we have developed a library of N-series lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) that could specifically regulate the protein composition of protein corona on the surface of LNPs, which allows specific delivery of mRNA to the lung. We further demonstrated that our lung-targeting LNP could effectively deliver mouse tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (Tsc2) mRNA into TSC2-null cells and restore its function, resulting in enhanced control of tumor burden in a preclinical model of lymphangioleiomyomatosis, a destructive lung disease caused by loss-of-function mutations in the Tsc2 gene. Safe and efficacious systemic delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) to specific organs and cells in vivo remains the major challenge in the development of mRNA-based therapeutics. Targeting of systemically administered lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) coformulated with mRNA has largely been confined to the liver and spleen. Using a library screening approach, we identified that N-series LNPs (containing an amide bond in the tail) are capable of selectively delivering mRNA to the mouse lung, in contrast to our previous discovery that O-series LNPs (containing an ester bond in the tail) that tend to deliver mRNA to the liver. We analyzed the protein corona on the liver- and lung-targeted LNPs using liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry and identified a group of unique plasma proteins specifically absorbed onto the surface that may contribute to the targetability of these LNPs. Different pulmonary cell types can also be targeted by simply tuning the headgroup structure of N-series LNPs. Importantly, we demonstrate here the success of LNP-based RNA therapy in a preclinical model of lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), a destructive lung disease caused by loss-of-function mutations in the Tsc2 gene. Our lung-targeting LNP exhibited highly efficient delivery of the mouse tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (Tsc2) mRNA for the restoration of TSC2 tumor suppressor in tumor and achieved remarkable therapeutic effect in reducing tumor burden. This research establishes mRNA LNPs as a promising therapeutic intervention for the treatment of LAM."

                "tldr": "PEGylation serves as a critical design feature in LNPs that reduces protein adsorption, particularly of opsonins that trigger immune clearance, thereby extending circulation time. The protective effects depend on PEG density, chain length, and lipid anchor stability, with longer lipid anchors (C18) providing superior stability against serum protein adsorption compared to shorter chains (C14). (10 sources)",
                "text": "\nPEGylation represents one of the most widely employed surface modification strategies for lipid nanoparticles, playing a crucial role in modulating protein corona formation and subsequent biological behavior. When LNPs enter the bloodstream, PEG molecules create a hydrophilic shield that significantly alters protein adsorption patterns. Studies using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) have demonstrated that increasing PEG densities on liposome surfaces correlates with reduced protein adsorption, confirming theoretical predictions about PEG's protective effects <Paper corpusId=\"231149926\" paperTitle=\"(Chain et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe primary mechanism by which PEGylation influences protein corona formation is through the reduction of interactions with specific blood proteins, particularly opsonins such as immunoglobulins (IgG and IgM), fibronectin, and complement proteins. These opsonins typically facilitate nanoparticle recognition by phagocytic cells, leading to rapid clearance from circulation. PEGylated LNPs show diminished adsorption of these proteins, allowing them to evade macrophage recognition and achieve extended circulation times <Paper corpusId=\"231820159\" paperTitle=\"(Aldosari et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"261730930\" paperTitle=\"(Monopoli et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"277127044\" paperTitle=\"(Zou et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"222296237\" paperTitle=\"(Papini et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe structural characteristics of PEG-lipids significantly impact their effectiveness in controlling protein corona formation. Both the PEG chain length and the lipid anchor play crucial roles in determining surface chemistry and PEG shedding rates, which directly influence which proteins adsorb to the LNP surface <Paper corpusId=\"269120128\" paperTitle=\"(Huang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. The lipid anchor length, in particular, has been shown to affect LNP stability in serum environments. Studies comparing PEG-lipids with different lipid tail lengths revealed that formulations with longer C18 chains (DSPE-PEG and DSG-PEG) maintained consistent particle size and concentration during serum incubation, while shorter C14 chains (DMG-PEG and DTA-PEG) showed increased mean size and decreased particle concentration, indicating greater protein adsorption <Paper corpusId=\"256802846\" paperTitle=\"(Berger et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe positioning and density of PEG-lipids on LNP surfaces also influence their structural properties. PEG-lipids primarily dictate LNP size, which in turn affects the distribution ratio of surface to core components and their packing arrangement. Importantly, PEG-lipids with longer lipid tails enhance the in vivo stability of LNPs, likely by creating a more persistent barrier against protein adsorption <Paper corpusId=\"250244349\" paperTitle=\"(Albertsen et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nDespite its advantages in reducing opsonization and extending circulation time, PEGylation presents certain limitations for targeted delivery applications. The protein corona can potentially shield targeting ligands on LNP surfaces, impeding their ability to recognize specific cellular receptors. Recent research has demonstrated that conjugating targeting ligands directly to the equilibrated protein corona resulted in more efficient target cell delivery compared to conjugating ligands to naked nanoparticles, which suffered from a 55% reduction in binding affinity when exposed to serum proteins <Paper corpusId=\"268147071\" paperTitle=\"(Lin et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nAdditionally, while PEGylation remains the dominant approach for creating \"stealth\" nanoparticles that evade immune recognition, it has limitations including potential anti-PEG antibody production and reduced cellular internalization. Alternative coating strategies, such as using Poloxamers (triblock copolymers), have shown promise in enhancing selective protein adsorption and facilitating specific tissue targeting, such as blood-brain barrier uptake <Paper corpusId=\"277127044\" paperTitle=\"(Zou et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"244713297\" paperTitle=\"(Tsakiri et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.",

It is well-documented that the type and quantity of the individual proteins employed in the formation of bimolecular corona will be determined by the intrinsic properties of nanoparticles as well as their biological activity (Monopoli et al., 2012). LNPs are known to interact with blood proteins (opsonins), such as immunoglobulins (IgG and IgM), fibronectin, and a number of complement proteins. These interactions will facilitate recognition and uptake of nanoparticles by the phagocytic cells and, consequently, promote their elimination (Moghimi et al., 2017). PEGylation of LNPs may diminish the recognition of nanoparticles and their rapid removal by phagocytic cells. It was reported that the inclusion of PEGylated lipids lowers the tendency of nanoparticles to adsorb complement proteins and immunoglobulins and, hence, allow nanoparticles to escape the macrophage system (Sch\u00f6ttler et al., 2016)."

Protein adsorption on LNPs depends on both the surface charge and the type of coating used. Studies have shown that high surface charge density increases protein adsorption, while specific coatings, such as Poloxamers, can enhance selective protein adsorption [122] and facilitate the BBB uptake process [123]. Conversely, proteins from the complement system, known as opsonins, mark LNPs for recognition by the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS), thereby accelerating their clearance and reducing their systemic circulation time [124].\n\nTo avoid rapid opsonization and MPS clearance, stealth NPs have been developed using PEG coatings, which delay PC formation and extend NP half-life in circulation. However, PEGylation has limitations, such as anti-PEG antibody production and reduced cellular internalization."

Among the NP-adsorbed proteome, some factors mediate cell binding, endocytosis, and clearing by macrophages and other phagocytes (opsonins), while some others display few affinities for the cell surface (dysopsonins). The functional mapping of opsonins and dysopsonins is instrumental to design long-circulating and nanotoxicologically safe next-generation nanotheranostics. In this review, we critically analyze functional data identifying specific proteins with opsonin or dysopsonin properties. Special attention is dedicated to the following: (1) the simplicity or complexity of the NP proteome and its modulation, (2) the role of specific host proteins in mediating the stealth properties of uncoated or polymer-coated NPs, and (3) the ability of the innate immune system, and, in particular, of the complement proteins, to mediate NP clearance by phagocytes. Emerging species-specific peculiarities, differentiating humans from preclinical animal models (the murine especially), are highlighted throughout this overview. The operative definition of opsonin and dysopsonin and the measurement schemes to assess their in vitro efficacy is critically re-examined. This provides a shared and unbiased approach useful for NP opsonin and dysopsonin systematic identification."

                            "The protein corona phenomenon, mainly influenced by the surface properties of LNPs, has become popular among researchers in the field of nanosized drug delivery systems. After the administration of LNPs, serum proteins are adsorbed on the surface of the nanoparticles evidently, forming a protein corona. This corona may impede targeted efficacy by shielding surface ligands necessary for specific cell or receptor recognition. Surface-exposed PEGylated lipids play a crucial role in determining and regulating the composition of the corona proteins on LNPs. Parallelly, the compositions of the corona proteins can govern the distributions of the nanoparticles due to the organ-specific accumulations of the serum proteins, such as ApoE for the liver and complementary system-related proteins for the spleen.\n\nIn a recent study, Chen et al. [70] investigated the role of apolipoprotein-and vitronectin-enriched corona on LNPs for targeted delivery and transfection of oligonucleotides in murine tumor models. A slight change in the physicochemical properties of LNPs altered the corona pattern. For instance, the introduction of positive charge via cationic lipid 3\u03b2-{N-[2-(dimethylamino) ethyl]carbamoyl}cholesterol (DC-cholesterol) as a substitution for original cholesterol shifted the protein corona pattern from apolipoprotein-rich to vitronectin-rich. In the aspect of transfection performance, nanoparticles with apolipoproteinrich corona showed better delivery to hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) as compared to those with vitronectin-rich corona. LNPs formulated with PEG-conjugated C18 lipids (either 3% or 6% molar ratio) were proved to be optimal for in vivo delivery to HepG2 tumor. The study revealed that the composition of the protein corona influenced the biodistribution and targeting efficiency of LNPs, highlighting the complex interplay between nanoparticle surface properties, including surface-coating PEG, protein interactions, and in vivo performance.\n\nIn the case of LNPs, PEG length and alkyl chain affect both surface chemistry and PEG shedding rate [67], thereby influencing the surface coronation and targeting tissues."

The increase in the mean size was related to the adsorption of proteins around LNPs. On the contrary, the DSPE-and DSG-PEG (C18)-based formulations (Figure 3A-D) did not show any flattening of their curves over time. These formulations were characterized by maintaining a constant average size with no decrease in concentration during incubation."

This is illustrated by all the LNP components that contribute to the structure/morphology of LNPs. The PEG-lipids dictate the LNP size, and thus, influence the ratio of the surface to core distribution of the remaining components, and thereby ultimately their packing motif.

The physicochemical assay was held in water HPLC-grade and Foetal Bovine Serum (FBS), in order to determine whether these systems can be used as drug or antigen delivery nanosystems. Dynamic and electrophoretic light scattering (DLS/ELS) techniques were used for the measurement of the hydrodynamic diameter, the polydispersity index, and the \u03b6-potential of the prepared nanosystems. The incorporation of the P407 resulted in a size reduction of all systems. A decrease in the hydrodynamic diameter and polydispersity index were also found as a result of increasing the storage temperature from 4\u2009\u00b0C to 25\u2009\u00b0C, attributed to P407. The experiments that were carried out in FBS, showed that the addition of P407 improved systems stealth properties. Concluding, we propose P407 as a promising alternative to PEG in the development of lipid nanoparticles with optimized bio- and shelf-stability."

Additionally, the corona profile can be influenced by ambient factors such as biomolecule concentration, pH, ionic strength, temperature and incubation time. Upon corona formation, the identity of the NP is transformed; its physicochemical properties, targeting abilities and biological responses change owing to the surrogated biological identity dictated by the adsorbed proteins. For example, characterization of the protein corona on core-shell NPs, composed of identical PEGylated lipid bilayer shells with varying core elasticities, revealed that apolipoprotein A1 preferentially adsorbs onto NPs with intermediate elasticity and the adsorption strongly correlates with longer NP elasticity-dependent in vivo systemic circulation lifetimes."

                            "When nanoparticles are exposed to a physiological environment, a \"protein corona\" is formed that greatly determines their biological fate. Adsorption of proteins could be influenced by chiral surfaces of nanoparticles; however, very few quantitative studies are available on the interaction of protein with the chiral surface of nanoparticles, and the underlying mechanism remains largely unresolved. We have developed a strategy to quantitatively analyze the adsorption and conformational features of transferrin on gold nanoparticles that are functionalized with d, l, and racemic penicillamine. We used a quartz microbalance platform to monitor the interaction of the adsorbed transferrin with transferrin receptors in HEK cell-derived liposomes. Results show that the chiral surface of nanoparticle determines the orientation and conformation of transferrin, which subsequently affects the interaction and recognition of transferrin with its receptor on the cellular membrane. Transferrin is widely used as a tumor-targeting ligand in cancer treatment and diagnosis since the transferrin receptor is overexpressed on the cell membrane of various types of cancer cells. Thus, the present results will help to expand the knowledge on biological identity of nanoparticles with chiral surfaces in a physiological environment and provide an insight into the rational design of therapeutic nanoparticles."

                            "Nanoparticles (NPs) adsorb proteins when in the biological matrix, and the resulted protein corona could affect NP-cell interactions. The corona has a dynamic nature with the adsorbed proteins constantly exchanging with the free proteins in the matrix at various rates. The rapidly exchanging proteins compose the soft corona, which responds more dynamically to environment changes than the hard corona established by the ones with slow exchange rates. In the present study, the corona formed on the superparamagnetic iron oxide NPs (SPIONs) in human serum was studied by flow field-flow fractionation and ultracentrifugation, which rapidly differentiated the corona proteins based on their exchange rates. By varying the surface hydrophobicity of the SPIONs with a core size around 10 nm, we found out that, the more hydrophobic surface ligand attracted proteins with higher surface hydrophobicity and formed a more dynamic corona with a larger portion of the involved proteins with fast exchange rates. Increasing the core diameter of the SPIONs but keeping the surface ligand the same could also result in a more dynamic corona. A brief investigation of the effect on the cellular uptake of SPIONs using one selected corona protein, transferrin, was conducted. The result showed that, only the stably bound transferrin could significantly enhance cellular uptake, while transferrin bound in a dynamic nature had negligible impact. Our study has led to a better understanding of the relationship between the particle properties and the dynamic nature of the corona, which can help with design of nanomaterials with higher biocompatibility and higher efficacy in biosystems for biomedical applications."

This is illustrated by all the LNP components that contribute to the structure/morphology of LNPs. The PEG-lipids dictate the LNP size, and thus, influence the ratio of the surface to core distribution of the remaining components, and thereby ultimately their packing motif.

                            "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have emerged as potent carriers for mRNA delivery, but several challenges remain before this approach can offer broad clinical translation of mRNA therapeutics. To improve their efficacy, a better understanding is required regarding how LNPs are trapped and processed at the anionic endosomal membrane prior to mRNA release. We used surface-sensitive fluorescence microscopy with single LNP resolution to investigate the pH dependency of the binding kinetics of ionizable lipid-containing LNPs to a supported endosomal model membrane. A sharp increase of LNP binding was observed when the pH was lowered from 6 to 5, accompanied by stepwise large-scale LNP disintegration. For LNPs preincubated in serum, protein corona formation shifted the onset of LNP binding and subsequent disintegration to lower pH, an effect that was less pronounced for lipoprotein-depleted serum. The LNP binding to the endosomal membrane mimic was observed to eventually become severely limited by suppression of the driving force for the formation of multivalent bonds during LNP attachment or, more specifically, by charge neutralization of anionic lipids in the model membrane due to their association with cationic lipids from earlier attached LNPs upon their disintegration. Cell uptake experiments demonstrated marginal differences in LNP uptake in untreated and lipoprotein-depleted serum, whereas lipoprotein-depleted serum increased mRNA-controlled protein (eGFP) production substantially. This complies with model membrane data and suggests that protein corona formation on the surface of the LNPs influences the nature of the interaction between LNPs and endosomal membranes."

Under in vitro cell culture conditions, zeta potential measurements, UV-vis spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscope analysis were used to monitor the time evolution of the inorganic NP-protein corona formation and to characterize the stability of the NPs and their surface state at every stage of the experiment. As expected, the red-shift of the surface plasmon resonance peak, as well as the drop of surface charge and the increase of the hydrodynamic diameter indicated the conjugation of proteins to NPs. Remarkably, an evolution from a loosely attached toward an irreversible attached protein corona over time was observed. Mass spectrometry of the digested protein corona revealed albumin as the most abundant component which suggests an improved biocompatibility."

Here, we use a library of polymer nanoparticles to show how physicochemical characteristics influence blood circulation and early distribution. For particles with different diameters, surface hydrophilicity appears to mediate early clearance. Densities above a critical value of approximately 20 poly(ethylene glycol) chains (MW 5\u2009kDa) per 100\u2009nm2 prolong circulation times, irrespective of size. In knockout mice, clearance mechanisms are identified for nanoparticles with low and high steric protection. Studies in animals deficient in the C3 protein showed that complement activation could not explain differences in the clearance of nanoparticles. In nanoparticles with low poly(ethylene glycol) coverage, adsorption of apolipoproteins can prolong circulation times. In parallel, the low-density-lipoprotein receptor plays a predominant role in the clearance of nanoparticles, irrespective of poly(ethylene glycol) density. These results further our understanding of nanopharmacology. Understanding the interaction between nanoparticles and biomolecules is crucial for improving current drug-delivery systems. Here, the authors shed light on the essential role of the surface and other physicochemical properties of a library of nanoparticles on their in vivo pharmacokinetics."

                            "It is now clearly emerging that besides size and shape, the other primary defining element of nanoscale objects in biological media is their long-lived protein (\"hard\") corona. This corona may be expressed as a durable, stabilizing coating of the bare surface of nanoparticle (NP) monomers, or it may be reflected in different subpopulations of particle assemblies, each presenting a durable protein coating. Using the approach and concepts of physical chemistry, we relate studies on the composition of the protein corona at different plasma concentrations with structural data on the complexes both in situ and free from excess plasma. This enables a high degree of confidence in the meaning of the hard protein corona in a biological context. Here, we present the protein adsorption for two compositionally different NPs, namely sulfonated polystyrene and silica NPs. NP-protein complexes are characterized by differential centrifugal sedimentation, dynamic light scattering, and zeta-potential both in situ and once isolated from plasma as a function of the protein/NP surface area ratio. We then introduce a semiquantitative determination of their hard corona composition using one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrospray liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, which allows us to follow the total binding isotherms for the particles, identifying simultaneously the nature and amount of the most relevant proteins as a function of the plasma concentration. We find that the hard corona can evolve quite significantly as one passes from protein concentrations appropriate to in vitro cell studies to those present in in vivo studies, which has deep implications for in vitro-in vivo extrapolations and will require some consideration in the future."

                            "For this purpose, we prepared coronated LNP and LNPi at different plasma percentages. Each batch was aliquoted into two portions. The first represents the formulation as synthesized in the laboratory, constituting the system ready for in vivo applications. This batch was kept as is for 1 hour at 37 \u00b0C. Simultaneously, the second batch was exposed to 50% HP, i.e., the percentage of plasma commonly used in literature to mimic the injection of NPs into the circulatory system. Finally, we employed SDS-PAGE to compare the corona composition of coronated LNP and LNPi before and after plasma exposure (the electrophoretic gel is shown in Supplementary Figure 6a). First, we observe that the electrophoretic profiles of coronated LNP (light gray) change as a function of protein concentration. This first observation is in line with previous results obtained with lipid gene vectors (Caracciolo et al., 2011) , and other NP types (Monopoli et al., 2011) . After exposure to 50% high protein concentration (depicted in dark grey), LNP displayed very similar protein profiles."

Here we investigate the compositional evolution of the protein corona of 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium propane (DOTAP) cationic liposomes (CLs) and DOTAP/DNA lipoplexes over a wide range of plasma concentrations (2.5-80%). The composition of the hard corona of lipoplexes is quite stable, but that of CLs does evolve considerably. We show that the protein corona of CLs is made of both low-affinity and competitive-binding proteins whose relative abundance changes with the plasma concentration. This result may have deep biological implications for the application of lipid-based gene vectors both in vitro and in vivo."

                            "The interactions between nanosized particles and living systems are commonly mediated by what adsorbs to the nanoparticle in the biological environment, its biomolecular corona, rather than the pristine surface. Here, we characterize the adhesion toward the cell membrane of nanoparticles of different material and size and study how this is modulated by the presence or absence of a corona on the nanoparticle surface. The results are corroborated with adsorption to simple model supported lipid bilayers using a quartz crystal microbalance. We conclude that the adsorption of proteins on the nanoparticle surface strongly reduces nanoparticle adhesion in comparison to what is observed for the bare material. Nanoparticle uptake is described as a two-step process, where the nanoparticles initially adhere to the cell membrane and subsequently are internalized by the cells via energy-dependent pathways. The lowered adhesion in the presence of proteins thereby causes a concomitant decrease in nanoparticle uptake efficiency. The presence of a biomolecular corona may confer specific interactions between the nanoparticle-corona complex and the cell surface including triggering of regulated cell uptake. An important effect of the corona is, however, a reduction in the purely unspecific interactions between the bare material and the cell membrane, which in itself disregarding specific interactions, causes a decrease in cellular uptake. We suggest that future nanoparticle-cell studies include, together with characterization of size, charge, and dispersion stability, an evaluation of the adhesion properties of the material to relevant membranes."

                            "Nanosized objects, such as nanoparticles and other drug carriers used in nanomedicine, once in contact with biological environments are modified by adsorption of biomolecules on their surface. The presence of this corona strongly affects the following interactions at cell and organism levels. It has been shown that corona proteins can be recognized by cell receptors. However, it is not known whether the composition of this acquired layer can also affect the mechanisms nanoparticles use to enter cells. This is of particular importance when considering that the same nanoparticles can form different coronas for instance in vitro when exposed to cells in different serum amounts or in vivo depending on the exposure or administration route. Thus, in this work, different coronas were formed on 50 nm silica by exposing them to different serum concentrations. The uptake efficiency in HeLa cells was compared, and the uptake mechanisms were characterized using transport inhibitors and RNA interference. The results showed that the nanoparticles were internalized by cells via different mechanisms when different coronas were formed, and only for one corona condition was uptake mediated by the LDL receptor. This suggested that coronas of different composition can be recognized differently by cell receptors, and this in turn leads to internalization via different mechanisms. Similar studies were performed using other cells, including A549 cells and primary HUVEC, and different nanoparticles, namely 100 nm liposomes and 200 nm silica. Overall, the results confirmed that the corona composition can affect the mechanisms of nanoparticle uptake by cells."

                            "The development of appropriate in vitro protocols to assess the potential toxicity of the ever expanding range of nanoparticles represents a challenging issue, because of the rapid changes of their intrinsic physicochemical properties (size, shape, reactivity, surface area, etc.) upon dispersion in biological fluids. Dynamic formation of protein coating around nanoparticles is a key molecular event, which may strongly impact the biological response in nanotoxicological tests. In this work, by using citrate-capped gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) of different sizes as a model, we show, by several spectroscopic techniques (dynamic light scattering, UV-visible, plasmon resonance light scattering), that proteins-NP interactions are differently mediated by two widely used cellular media (i.e., Dulbecco Modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium (RPMI), supplemented with fetal bovine serum). We found that, while DMEM elicits the formation of a large time-dependent protein corona, RPMI shows different dynamics with reduced protein coating. Characterization of these nanobioentities was also performed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and mass spectroscopy, revealing that the average composition of protein corona does not reflect the relative abundance of serum proteins. To evaluate the biological impact of such hybrid bionanostructures, several comparative viability assays onto two cell lines (HeLa and U937) were carried out in the two media, in the presence of 15 nm AuNPs. We observed that proteins/NP complexes formed in RPMI are more abundantly internalized in cells as compared to DMEM, overall exerting higher cytotoxic effects. These results show that, beyond an in-depth NPs characterization before cellular experiments, a detailed understanding of the effects elicited by cell culture media on NPs is crucial for standardized nanotoxicology tests."

                "text": "\nWhen lipid nanoparticles encounter biological fluids, the formation of a protein corona significantly alters their biological behavior and therapeutic outcomes. This transformation changes the physicochemical properties of LNPs, increasing their hydrodynamic diameter and modifying their surface charge, which ultimately affects how they interact with cells and tissues <Paper corpusId=\"267076387\" paperTitle=\"(John et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"254658641\" paperTitle=\"(Aliakbarinodehi et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. The protein corona serves as the biological interface between LNPs and cellular systems, mediating critical processes including cellular recognition, uptake mechanisms, and intracellular trafficking.\n\nParticularly significant is the role of specific proteins within the corona in determining organ targeting and biodistribution. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) plays a crucial role in mediating LNP binding to LDL receptors on plasma membranes, significantly contributing to cellular uptake and liver targeting <Paper corpusId=\"267076387\" paperTitle=\"(John et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"268690018\" paperTitle=\"(Vaidya et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. The presence of ApoE in the protein corona is largely responsible for the high liver tropism observed with many LNP formulations, including the clinically approved Onpattro <Paper corpusId=\"263607931\" paperTitle=\"(Amici et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"206788144\" paperTitle=\"(Caracciolo et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper>. This understanding has led to a significant paradigm shift in nanoparticle design, moving from attempting to prevent protein corona formation to strategically leveraging it for targeted delivery.\n\nThe concept of \"endogenous targeting\" has emerged as a promising approach for overcoming the predominant liver accumulation of LNPs. By rationally engineering LNP composition to interact with specific proteins in the bloodstream, researchers can achieve organ-specific delivery beyond the liver <Paper corpusId=\"261091800\" paperTitle=\"(2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"245405261\" paperTitle=\"(Dilliard et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. This strategy has demonstrated that different protein corona compositions can direct LNPs to specific organs: ApoE-rich coronas target the liver, \u03b22-GPI-rich coronas target the lungs, and vitronectin-rich coronas target the spleen <Paper corpusId=\"273570097\" paperTitle=\"(Vasileva et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"245405261\" paperTitle=\"(Dilliard et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe protein corona can also significantly impact the immune response to LNPs. LNPs are known to interact with opsonins such as immunoglobulins and complement proteins, which facilitate recognition and clearance by phagocytic cells <Paper corpusId=\"231820159\" paperTitle=\"(Aldosari et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"16024780\" paperTitle=\"(Neagu et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"261730930\" paperTitle=\"(Monopoli et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper>. PEGylation can diminish these interactions, reducing recognition and rapid clearance by the mononuclear phagocytic system <Paper corpusId=\"231820159\" paperTitle=\"(Aldosari et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"277127044\" paperTitle=\"(Zou et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"222296237\" paperTitle=\"(Papini et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. However, PEGylated surfaces can still adsorb proteins, and the specific composition of this corona influences how cells recognize and process the nanoparticles <Paper corpusId=\"3328751\" paperTitle=\"(Pozzi et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nRecent research has revealed that subtle changes in LNP composition can dramatically alter protein corona patterns. For example, substituting traditional cholesterol with cationic DC-cholesterol shifts the protein corona from apolipoprotein-rich to vitronectin-rich, significantly affecting transfection performance in different cell types <Paper corpusId=\"269120128\" paperTitle=\"(Huang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. Similarly, different surface charges can alter the isoelectric point distribution of adsorbed proteins, directing LNPs to specific organs based on distinct pKa ranges: 6.2-6.5 for liver targeting, 2-6 for spleen targeting, and 7-9 for lung targeting <Paper corpusId=\"261091800\" paperTitle=\"(2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"40205755\" paperTitle=\"(Jayaraman et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe biological consequences of protein corona formation extend to cellular internalization mechanisms. The presence of a protein corona generally reduces nanoparticle adhesion to cell membranes compared to bare particles, affecting cellular uptake efficiency <Paper corpusId=\"274333034\" paperTitle=\"(Catenacci et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. However, the specific composition of the corona can lead to distinct uptake pathways based on which cellular receptors recognize the corona proteins <Paper corpusId=\"273531369\" paperTitle=\"(Renzi et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. This highlights the importance of understanding not just which proteins adsorb but also how they interact with cellular machinery.\n\nNotably, the biological environment significantly influences corona formation and subsequent biological outcomes. Distinct differences in protein corona composition arise when nanoparticles are exposed to different biological fluids such as whole blood, plasma, or serum <Paper corpusId=\"7055332\" paperTitle=\"(Lundqvist et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>. Even individual variation in blood composition can result in patient-specific protein coronas with unique biological consequences, depending on factors such as pathological conditions, gender, age, and administration site <Paper corpusId=\"274333034\" paperTitle=\"(Catenacci et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nEmerging research has demonstrated the potential of leveraging these insights for developing targeted therapies. For example, lung-targeting LNPs with specific protein corona compositions have shown promising results in treating nonsmall cell lung cancers through the delivery of therapeutic mRNAs to lung endothelial cells <Paper corpusId=\"271918870\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"268261037\" paperTitle=\"(Le et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. Similarly, LNP-based mRNA therapies have been successfully applied in preclinical models of lymphangioleiomyomatosis, a destructive lung disease, by exploiting specific protein corona patterns to achieve lung-targeted delivery <Paper corpusId=\"246902168\" paperTitle=\"(Qiu et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. These examples illustrate how the controlled formation of specific protein coronas can be harnessed to develop next-generation targeted therapies that overcome the traditional limitations of liver accumulation.",

                            "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have emerged as potent carriers for mRNA delivery, but several challenges remain before this approach can offer broad clinical translation of mRNA therapeutics. To improve their efficacy, a better understanding is required regarding how LNPs are trapped and processed at the anionic endosomal membrane prior to mRNA release. We used surface-sensitive fluorescence microscopy with single LNP resolution to investigate the pH dependency of the binding kinetics of ionizable lipid-containing LNPs to a supported endosomal model membrane. A sharp increase of LNP binding was observed when the pH was lowered from 6 to 5, accompanied by stepwise large-scale LNP disintegration. For LNPs preincubated in serum, protein corona formation shifted the onset of LNP binding and subsequent disintegration to lower pH, an effect that was less pronounced for lipoprotein-depleted serum. The LNP binding to the endosomal membrane mimic was observed to eventually become severely limited by suppression of the driving force for the formation of multivalent bonds during LNP attachment or, more specifically, by charge neutralization of anionic lipids in the model membrane due to their association with cationic lipids from earlier attached LNPs upon their disintegration. Cell uptake experiments demonstrated marginal differences in LNP uptake in untreated and lipoprotein-depleted serum, whereas lipoprotein-depleted serum increased mRNA-controlled protein (eGFP) production substantially. This complies with model membrane data and suggests that protein corona formation on the surface of the LNPs influences the nature of the interaction between LNPs and endosomal membranes."

                            "In recent times, novel opportunities have emerged in the realm of bionano interactions, presenting new avenues for the development of targeted NPs. These interactions result in the encapsulation of NPs by biomolecules, leading to the formation of a biomolecular corona, commonly known as the protein corona, due to its predominant enrichment with plasma proteins. Initially, it was observed that the presence of a protein corona on NPs hinders the effectiveness of targeting ligands, 23 thereby impairing the NP's targeting ability. However, it was later recognized that complete avoidance of protein corona formation, even in PEGylated systems, is not feasible. (Pozzi et al., 2014) Consequently, efforts were redirected toward harnessing the protein corona as an inherent targeting moiety, as the proteins acquired from the bloodstream could potentially serve as targeting ligands. (Caracciolo, 2015) ur research group has successfully provided direct evidence of targeted delivery of NPs by coating a cationic liposome with a protein corona enriched in vitronectin. (Caracciolo et al., 2013) This plasma protein bestowed the liposome with the remarkable ability to selectively target and bind to cancer cells that exhibit an elevated level of expression of the vitronectin receptor. A recent scientific hypothesis has suggested that the high liver tropism and transfection potency exhibited by Onpattro may be attributed to the formation of a protein corona enriched with Apo-E. (Akinc et al., 2019) This protein corona, in turn, enables the recognition of hepatocytes through the LDL receptor, potentially contributing to its liver-targeting capabilities."

                            "Upon intravenous injection, the nanoparticles come into contact with the serum, leading proteins to adsorb on their surface and form a distinctive protein corona layer (Dilliard et al., 2021). The presence of the protein corona may alter the properties of the nanoparticles, with profound influences for their tissue specificity. For instance, most LNPs exhibit hepatic specificity via intravenous administration, owing to the adsorption of ApoE by binding to the LDLR that are over-expressed on the hepatocytes (Dilliard et al., 2021). Additionally, it has been validated that the knockdown of ApoE lowered the liver targeting of nanomaterials by delivering mRNA into a mouse model lacking ApoE expression (Dilliard et al., 2021). Although the mechanism of endogenous targeting is still not fully explored, researchers have striven to investigate the rules. It is discovered that when the PEG-lipids desorb from LNPs, specific protein binding to LNPs is promoted. The desorption rate of PEG-lipids with longer hydrophobic chains is slower, which might not conducive to formulating appropriate protein coronas and achieving organ targeted delivery (Dilliard et al., 2021). In parallel, nano-vectors with different structures and properties may adsorb different proteins, resulting in protein coronas with distinct components and properties. The formation of protein corona at the interface will alter the physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles, exhibiting a crucial impact on their biodistribution and endocytosis (Eygeris et al., 2021). It has been demonstrated that LNPs with different pKa values can influence their organ targeting. More specifically, the preferred pK a range for liver, spleen, and lung targeting is 6.2~6.5, 2~6, and 7~9, respectively (Dilliard et al., 2021)(Jayaraman et al., 2012)(Xiong et al., 2020)."

                            "Significance Liver accumulation represents a significant barrier in the development of therapeutically efficacious nanoparticle drug delivery systems. Using a series of lipid nanoparticles with distinct organ-targeting properties, we provide evidence for a plausible mechanism of action for nanoparticle delivery to non-liver tissues. Following intravenous injection, specific proteins in the blood are recruited to the nanoparticle\u2019s surface based on its molecular composition and they endow it with a unique biological identity that governs its ultimate fate in the body. An innovative paradigm emerges from this mechanistic understanding of nanoparticle delivery\u2014endogenous targeting\u2014wherein the molecular composition of a nanoparticle is rationally engineered to interact with specific proteins in the blood to overcome liver accumulation and to target specific organs. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a clinically mature technology for the delivery of genetic medicines but have limited therapeutic applications due to liver accumulation. Recently, our laboratory developed selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles that expand the therapeutic applications of genetic medicines by enabling delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) and gene editing systems to non-liver tissues. SORT nanoparticles include a supplemental SORT molecule whose chemical structure determines the LNP\u2019s tissue-specific activity. To understand how SORT nanoparticles surpass the delivery barrier of liver hepatocyte accumulation, we studied the mechanistic factors which define their organ-targeting properties. We discovered that the chemical nature of the added SORT molecule controlled biodistribution, global/apparent pKa, and serum protein interactions of SORT nanoparticles. Additionally, we provide evidence for an endogenous targeting mechanism whereby organ targeting occurs via 1) desorption of poly(ethylene glycol) lipids from the LNP surface, 2) binding of distinct proteins to the nanoparticle surface because of recognition of exposed SORT molecules, and 3) subsequent interactions between surface-bound proteins and cognate receptors highly expressed in specific tissues. These findings establish a crucial link between the molecular composition of SORT nanoparticles and their unique and precise organ-targeting properties and suggest that the recruitment of specific proteins to a nanoparticle\u2019s surface can enable drug delivery beyond the liver."

It is well-documented that the type and quantity of the individual proteins employed in the formation of bimolecular corona will be determined by the intrinsic properties of nanoparticles as well as their biological activity (Monopoli et al., 2012). LNPs are known to interact with blood proteins (opsonins), such as immunoglobulins (IgG and IgM), fibronectin, and a number of complement proteins. These interactions will facilitate recognition and uptake of nanoparticles by the phagocytic cells and, consequently, promote their elimination (Moghimi et al., 2017). PEGylation of LNPs may diminish the recognition of nanoparticles and their rapid removal by phagocytic cells. It was reported that the inclusion of PEGylated lipids lowers the tendency of nanoparticles to adsorb complement proteins and immunoglobulins and, hence, allow nanoparticles to escape the macrophage system (Sch\u00f6ttler et al., 2016)."

Protein adsorption on LNPs depends on both the surface charge and the type of coating used. Studies have shown that high surface charge density increases protein adsorption, while specific coatings, such as Poloxamers, can enhance selective protein adsorption [122] and facilitate the BBB uptake process [123]. Conversely, proteins from the complement system, known as opsonins, mark LNPs for recognition by the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS), thereby accelerating their clearance and reducing their systemic circulation time [124].\n\nTo avoid rapid opsonization and MPS clearance, stealth NPs have been developed using PEG coatings, which delay PC formation and extend NP half-life in circulation. However, PEGylation has limitations, such as anti-PEG antibody production and reduced cellular internalization."

Among the NP-adsorbed proteome, some factors mediate cell binding, endocytosis, and clearing by macrophages and other phagocytes (opsonins), while some others display few affinities for the cell surface (dysopsonins). The functional mapping of opsonins and dysopsonins is instrumental to design long-circulating and nanotoxicologically safe next-generation nanotheranostics. In this review, we critically analyze functional data identifying specific proteins with opsonin or dysopsonin properties. Special attention is dedicated to the following: (1) the simplicity or complexity of the NP proteome and its modulation, (2) the role of specific host proteins in mediating the stealth properties of uncoated or polymer-coated NPs, and (3) the ability of the innate immune system, and, in particular, of the complement proteins, to mediate NP clearance by phagocytes. Emerging species-specific peculiarities, differentiating humans from preclinical animal models (the murine especially), are highlighted throughout this overview. The operative definition of opsonin and dysopsonin and the measurement schemes to assess their in vitro efficacy is critically re-examined. This provides a shared and unbiased approach useful for NP opsonin and dysopsonin systematic identification."

                            "When nanoparticles (NPs) enter a physiological environment, medium components compete for binding to the NP surface leading to formation of a rich protein shell known as the \"protein corona\". Unfortunately, opsonins are also adsorbed. These proteins are immediately recognized by the phagocyte system with rapid clearance of the NPs from the bloodstream. Polyethyleneglycol (PEG) coating of NPs (PEGylation) is the most efficient anti-opsonization strategy. Linear chains of PEG, grafted onto the NP surface, are able to create steric hindrance, resulting in a significant inhibition of protein adsorption and less recognition by macrophages. However, excessive PEGylation can lead to a strong inhibition of cellular uptake and less efficient binding with protein targets, reducing the potential of the delivery system. To reach a compromise in this regard we employed a multi-component (MC) lipid system with uncommon properties of cell uptake and endosomal escape and increasing length of PEG chains. Nano liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS/MS) analysis allowed us to accurately determine the corona composition showing that apolipoproteins are the most abundant class in the corona and that increasing the PEG length reduced the protein adsorption and the liposomal surface affinity for apolipoproteins. Due to the abundance of apolipoproteins, we exploited the \"protein corona effect\" to deliver cationic liposome-human plasma complexes to human prostate cancer PC3 cells that express a high level of scavenger receptor class B type 1 in order to evaluate the cellular uptake efficiency of the systems used. Combining laser scanning confocal microscopy with flow cytometry analysis in PC3 cells we demonstrated that MC-PEG2k is the best compromise between an anti-opsonization strategy and active targeting and could be a promising candidate to treat prostate cancer in vivo."

After the administration of LNPs, serum proteins are adsorbed on the surface of the nanoparticles evidently, forming a protein corona. This corona may impede targeted efficacy by shielding surface ligands necessary for specific cell or receptor recognition. Surface-exposed PEGylated lipids play a crucial role in determining and regulating the composition of the corona proteins on LNPs. Parallelly, the compositions of the corona proteins can govern the distributions of the nanoparticles due to the organ-specific accumulations of the serum proteins, such as ApoE for the liver and complementary system-related proteins for the spleen.\n\nIn a recent study, Chen et al. [70] investigated the role of apolipoprotein-and vitronectin-enriched corona on LNPs for targeted delivery and transfection of oligonucleotides in murine tumor models. A slight change in the physicochemical properties of LNPs altered the corona pattern. For instance, the introduction of positive charge via cationic lipid 3\u03b2-{N-[2-(dimethylamino) ethyl]carbamoyl}cholesterol (DC-cholesterol) as a substitution for original cholesterol shifted the protein corona pattern from apolipoprotein-rich to vitronectin-rich. In the aspect of transfection performance, nanoparticles with apolipoproteinrich corona showed better delivery to hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) as compared to those with vitronectin-rich corona. LNPs formulated with PEG-conjugated C18 lipids (either 3% or 6% molar ratio) were proved to be optimal for in vivo delivery to HepG2 tumor. The study revealed that the composition of the protein corona influenced the biodistribution and targeting efficiency of LNPs, highlighting the complex interplay between nanoparticle surface properties, including surface-coating PEG, protein interactions, and in vivo performance.\n\nIn the case of LNPs, PEG length and alkyl chain affect both surface chemistry and PEG shedding rate [67], thereby influencing the surface coronation and targeting tissues."

                            "When NPs enter the bloodstream, some biomolecules interact with the LNP surface, resulting in their encapsulation and leading to the formation of a corona. This corona is commonly known as protein corona (PC) due to the predominant presence of plasma proteins (Amici et al., 2023). The PC formation is a spontaneous process that occurs rapidly thanks to noncovalent interactions between proteins and the LNP surface (Tomak et al., 2021). \n\nThe presence of PC influences many properties of LNPs such as surface charge, hydrophilic and hydrophobic characteristics, stability, targeting ability, aggregation phenomena, toxicity, and efficacy, and, when RNA or DNA are loaded in LNPs, the PC affected also their transfection efficiency (Simonsen, 2024)(Renzi et al., 2024). Data published on PC-coated LNPs seem to conflict with each other; in fact, many researchers observed a reduction in the targeting ability of nanoparticles after the PC formation (Salvati et al., 2013), an increase in LNP aggregation, a decrease in LNP stability, and the leakage of fluorophores used for LNP tracking in vivo (Francia et al., 2020) (Figure 6), while other researchers suggested that the PC formation could be favorable to obtain a specific LNP targeting (Qiu et al., 2022). \n\nThe PC composition is principally affected by the physico-chemical properties and the biological environment of LNPs; it is also important to underline that the administration of the same LNP formulation to different patients could result in a different interaction of LNP-PC, specific for everyone (depending, as example, on pathological conditions, gender, age, and administration site) (Lundqvist et al., 2017)(Straten et al., 2024)."

The first represents the formulation as synthesized in the laboratory, constituting the system ready for in vivo applications. This batch was kept as is for 1 hour at 37 \u00b0C. Simultaneously, the second batch was exposed to 50% HP, i.e., the percentage of plasma commonly used in literature to mimic the injection of NPs into the circulatory system. Finally, we employed SDS-PAGE to compare the corona composition of coronated LNP and LNPi before and after plasma exposure (the electrophoretic gel is shown in Supplementary Figure 6a). First, we observe that the electrophoretic profiles of coronated LNP (light gray) change as a function of protein concentration. This first observation is in line with previous results obtained with lipid gene vectors (Caracciolo et al., 2011) , and other NP types (Monopoli et al., 2011) . After exposure to 50% high protein concentration (depicted in dark grey), LNP displayed very similar protein profiles."

                            "The protein corona formed around nanoparticles in protein-rich fluids plays an important role for nanoparticle biocompatibility, as found in several studies during the last decade. Biological fluids have complex compositions and the molecular components interact and function together in intricate networks. Therefore, the process to isolate blood or the preparation of blood derivatives may lead to differences in the composition of the identified protein corona around nanoparticles. Here, we show distinct differences in the protein corona formed in whole blood, whole blood with EDTA, plasma, or serum. Furthermore, the ratio between particle surface area to protein concentration influences the detected corona. We also show that the nanoparticle size per se influences the formed protein corona due to curvature effects. These results emphasize the need of investigating the formation and biological importance of the protein corona in the same environment as the nanoparticles are intended for or released into."

                            "The formation of the protein corona significantly alters the surface characteristics of nanoparticles, thus greatly affecting their interactions with organs and cells. In a recent study, Le ND et al. synthesized a series of poly(\u03b2-amino ester) (PBAE) derivatives and found that the protein corona on nanoparticles could help achieve organ targeting (lungs and spleen) (Le et al., 2024). Interestingly, their findings correlated closely with the study of Min Qiu et al. [33] , which demonstrated that the protein corona on lung-targeted nanoparticles had distinct characteristics that promoted lung accumulation. The protein corona formed on the surface of liposomes is primarily influenced by the physicochemical properties of the liposomes themselves. By selecting different lipid components or varying their ratios, it is possible to achieve targeting of different organs or cells."

                            "Therapeutic antibodies that block vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) show clinical benefits in treating nonsmall cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) by inhibiting tumor angiogenesis. Nonetheless, the therapeutic effects of systemically administered anti-VEGF antibodies are often hindered in NSCLCs because of their limited distribution in the lungs and their adverse effects on normal tissues. These challenges can be overcome by delivering therapeutic antibodies in their mRNA form to lung endothelial cells, a primary target of VEGF-mediated pulmonary angiogenesis, to suppress the NSCLCs. In this study, we synthesized derivatives of poly(\u03b2-amino esters) (PBAEs) and prepared nanoparticles to encapsulate the synthetic mRNA encoding bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF antibody used in the clinic. Optimization of nanoparticle formulations resulted in a selective lung transfection after intravenous administration. Notably, the optimized PBAE nanoparticles were distributed in lung endothelial cells, resulting in the secretion of bevacizumab. We analyzed the protein corona on the lung- and spleen-targeting nanoparticles using proteomics and found distinctive features potentially contributing to their organ-selectivity. Lastly, bevacizumab mRNA delivered by the lung-targeting PBAE nanoparticles more significantly inhibited tumor proliferation and angiogenesis than recombinant bevacizumab protein in orthotopic NSCLC mouse models, supporting the therapeutic potential of bevacizumab mRNA therapy and its selective delivery through lung-targeting nanoparticles. Our proof-of-principle results highlight the clinical benefits of nanoparticle-mediated mRNA therapy in anticancer antibody treatment in preclinical models."

                            "Significance The current application of messenger RNA (mRNA)-based technology has largely been confined to liver diseases because of the lack of a specific and efficient extrahepatic in vivo systemic mRNA delivery system. Here, we have developed a library of N-series lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) that could specifically regulate the protein composition of protein corona on the surface of LNPs, which allows specific delivery of mRNA to the lung. We further demonstrated that our lung-targeting LNP could effectively deliver mouse tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (Tsc2) mRNA into TSC2-null cells and restore its function, resulting in enhanced control of tumor burden in a preclinical model of lymphangioleiomyomatosis, a destructive lung disease caused by loss-of-function mutations in the Tsc2 gene. Safe and efficacious systemic delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) to specific organs and cells in vivo remains the major challenge in the development of mRNA-based therapeutics. Targeting of systemically administered lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) coformulated with mRNA has largely been confined to the liver and spleen. Using a library screening approach, we identified that N-series LNPs (containing an amide bond in the tail) are capable of selectively delivering mRNA to the mouse lung, in contrast to our previous discovery that O-series LNPs (containing an ester bond in the tail) that tend to deliver mRNA to the liver. We analyzed the protein corona on the liver- and lung-targeted LNPs using liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry and identified a group of unique plasma proteins specifically absorbed onto the surface that may contribute to the targetability of these LNPs. Different pulmonary cell types can also be targeted by simply tuning the headgroup structure of N-series LNPs. Importantly, we demonstrate here the success of LNP-based RNA therapy in a preclinical model of lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), a destructive lung disease caused by loss-of-function mutations in the Tsc2 gene. Our lung-targeting LNP exhibited highly efficient delivery of the mouse tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (Tsc2) mRNA for the restoration of TSC2 tumor suppressor in tumor and achieved remarkable therapeutic effect in reducing tumor burden. This research establishes mRNA LNPs as a promising therapeutic intervention for the treatment of LAM."
