They are mainly responsible for removing particles and pathogens from the blood through phagocytosis [58]. To enhance the uptake of LNPs by Kupffer cells and their immunoregulation ability, research has explored various strategies, including increasing the size of LNPs and modifying the LNP surface with hydrophobic molecules [59]. Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) are located in the sinusoidal space of the liver, where they play important roles in blood filtration, metabolic regulation, antigen presentation, and lipid metabolism. LSECs have a unique structure and function, enabling them to play a crucial role in immune and metabolic processes in the liver [60]. Targeting LNPs to Kupffer cells and LSECs can lead to more effective drug or gene delivery, especially in the treatment of liver diseases. For example, in diseases that require liver-specific treatment, such as hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and liver cancer, this targeted delivery strategy can improve the therapeutic outcomes and reduce unnecessary side-effects. Paunovska et al. [61] explored the use of different types of cholesterol to modify LNPs and reported that the structure of the cholesterol significantly affects the targeting ability of the LNPs. In addition, by using the Fast Identification Nanoparticle Delivery (FIND) system, they screened LNPs formulated with different oxidized cholesterol and observed that LNPs containing oxidized cholesterol can efficiently deliver mRNA to cells in the liver microenvironment, including Kupffer cells and liver endothelial cells. This contrasts with conventional LNPs, which primarily target hepatocytes, and suggests that the targeting of LNPs to specific cell types can be improved by specific chemical modifications. This improved targeting has significant implications for the treatment of liver diseases and the application of immunotherapy.",

This would permit electrostatic interactions with targeted tissues since both structures would have complementary charges. This could selectively enhance the uptake of LNPs by tissues of interest with minimal distribution to others, in a process that is called ionic-based physical targeting. \n\n3][34][35][36][37][38] LNPs, especially those containing lipids, namely YSK05 and YSK13-C3, showed a high cellular uptake, strong endosomal escape, and efficient siRNA delivery and silencing activity, especially in hepatocytes. 33,34 We also found that the pKa value of the LNP membrane influences its intrahepatic distribution. For example, LNPs that contain lipids with low pKa values (eg, YSK05 and YSK13-C3 with pKa values of 6.50 and 6.45 pKa, respectively) are distributed in hepatocytes. Whereas, those containing lipids with higher pKa values (eg, YSK13-C4 and YSK15-C4 with pKa values of 6.80 and 7.10, respectively) are distributed in LSECs, 32 which are border cells that are located between hepatocytes and the blood stream. 16,17 However, due to the limited range of pKa values (5.70-7.25) that were tested in that previous study, 32 higher pKa values were not evaluated and the optimal pKa value for an LNP for uptake by LSECs was not confirmed. Furthermore, despite the enhanced pKa-dependent distribution of YSK13-C4-and YSK15-C4-LNPs in LSECs, the silencing activity in those cells was relatively weak, probably due to their inactivation by EL which are distributed in LSECs and have phospholipase activity that cleaves the ester linkage present in those lipids. 32,41",

LSECs, which are the physical barrier that separate liver tissues from the blood flow, 16,17 have significant roles under normal conditions, including providing a selective and permeable barrier, facilitating the transport of metabolites and waste clearance, [18][19][20] regulating hepatic blood flow, maintaining a low portal pressure, 21 and keeping hepatic stellate cells in their inactivated state to prevent fibrosis. 22 ][29][30][31] Therefore, LSECs are possible drug targets for preventing or treating related liver disorders, especially those associated with genetic disturbances. Based on our previous observations, LSECs take up LNPs with higher pKa values, in the pKa range tested (5.70-7.25). 32 However, higher pKa values were not examined and the optimum pKa value for targeting LSECs is not currently known. \n\nWe previously developed an LNP composed of different types of pH-sensitive cationic lipids, namely YSK lipids (referred to as YSK-LNP), to deliver siRNA in vitro and in vivo, particularly in hepatocytes. 33,34 In our previous study, slightly cationic LNP formulations that were composed of lipids with high pKa values, such as YSK13-C4 (pKa 6.80) and YSK15-C4 (pKa 7.10), were found to be highly localized in LSECs as opposed to hepatocytes. 32 Nevertheless, they showed a weak gene silencing activity in LSECs, possibly due to their inactivation by endothelial lipase (EL). 32 his prompted us to investigate the feasibility of targeting LSECs using lipase-resistant LNPs in which the membrane had optimized pKa values.",

The first strategy is the synthesis of various lipids with different chemical structures and pKa values for use in preparing LNPs with a wide range of membrane pKa values and screen the uptake and activity of each in LSECs. However, this method is time-and effort-consuming, not cost-effective, and results in limited pKa adjustments. Therefore, we adopted a more effective strategy, which involved mixing two lipids at different molar ratios with low and high pKa values in several LNP formulations to permit the pKa value of the final LNP membrane. These lipids are YSK05 (a pH-sensitive cationic lipid with a pKa value of 6.50), and YSK12-C4 (a highly cationic lipid with a pKa value of 8.00). Their chemical structures are shown in Figure 1. These lipids were chosen because they have a strong endosomal escape, strong activity (YSK05 in hepatocytes, in vivo, 33 and YSK12-C4 in dendritic cells, in vitro 36 ), and are resistant to the action of lipases.

Harashima\n## Abstract\nIntroduction The development of targeted drug delivery systems is a rapidly growing area in the field of nanomedicine. Methods We report herein on optimizing the targeting efficiency of a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) by manipulating the acid dissociation constant (pKa) value of its membrane, which reflects its ionization status. Instead of changing the chemical structure of the lipids to achieve this, we used a mixture of two types of pH-sensitive cationic lipids that show different pKa values in a single LNP. We mixed various ratios of YSK05 and YSK12-C4 lipids, which have pKa values of 6.50 and 8.00, respectively, in one formulation (referred to as YSK05/12-LNP). Results The pKa of the YSK05/12-LNP was dependent not only on the molar ratio of each lipid but also on the individual contribution of each lipid to the final pKa (the YSK12-C4 lipid showed a higher contribution). Furthermore, we succeeded in targeting and delivering short interfering RNA to liver sinusoidal endothelial cells using one of the YSK05/12-LNPs which showed an optimum pKa value of 7.15 and an appropriate ionization status (~36% cationic charge) to permit the particles to be taken up by liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. Conclusion This strategy has the potential for preparing custom LNPs with endless varieties of structures and final pKa values, and would have poten tial applications in drug delivery and ionic-based tissue targeting.\n## Introduction\nLiver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) are an example of a tissue that would be a suitable model for our study and could be targeted based on the ionic charge of their surface. LSECs, which are the physical barrier that separate liver tissues from the blood flow, 16,17 have significant roles under normal conditions, including providing a selective and permeable barrier, facilitating the transport of metabolites and waste clearance, [18][19][20] regulating hepatic blood flow, maintaining a low portal pressure, 21 and keeping hepatic stellate cells in their inactivated state to prevent fibrosis. 22 ][29][30][31] Therefore, LSECs are possible drug targets for preventing or treating related liver disorders, especially those associated with genetic disturbances. Based on our previous observations, LSECs take up LNPs with higher pKa values, in the pKa range tested (5.70-7.25). 32 However, higher pKa values were not examined and the optimum pKa value for targeting LSECs is not currently known. \n\nWe previously developed an LNP composed of different types of pH-sensitive cationic lipids, namely YSK lipids (referred to as YSK-LNP), to deliver siRNA in vitro and in vivo, particularly in hepatocytes. 33,34 In our previous study, slightly cationic LNP formulations that were composed of lipids with high pKa values, such as YSK13-C4 (pKa 6.80) and YSK15-C4 (pKa 7.10), were found to be highly localized in LSECs as opposed to hepatocytes. 32 Nevertheless, they showed a weak gene silencing activity in LSECs, possibly due to their inactivation by endothelial lipase (EL). 32 his prompted us to investigate the feasibility of targeting LSECs using lipase-resistant LNPs in which the membrane had optimized pKa values.\n\n## Discussion\nThe aim of this study was to improve the targeting efficiency of an LNP by optimizing the dissociation constant (pKa) value for its membrane, which reflects its ionization property or surface charge. This would permit electrostatic interactions with targeted tissues since both structures would have complementary charges. This could selectively enhance the uptake of LNPs by tissues of interest with minimal distribution to others, in a process that is called ionic-based physical targeting. \n\n3][34][35][36][37][38] LNPs, especially those containing lipids, namely YSK05 and YSK13-C3, showed a high cellular uptake, strong endosomal escape, and efficient siRNA delivery and silencing activity, especially in hepatocytes. 33,34 We also found that the pKa value of the LNP membrane influences its intrahepatic distribution. For example, LNPs that contain lipids with low pKa values (eg, YSK05 and YSK13-C3 with pKa values of 6.50 and 6.45 pKa, respectively) are distributed in hepatocytes. Whereas, those containing lipids with higher pKa values (eg, YSK13-C4 and YSK15-C4 with pKa values of 6.80 and 7.10, respectively) are distributed in LSECs, 32 which are border cells that are located between hepatocytes and the blood stream. 16,17 However, due to the limited range of pKa values (5.70-7.25) that were tested in that previous study, 32 higher pKa values were not evaluated and the optimal pKa value for an LNP for uptake by LSECs was not confirmed. Furthermore, despite the enhanced pKa-dependent distribution of YSK13-C4-and YSK15-C4-LNPs in LSECs, the silencing activity in those cells was relatively weak, probably due to their inactivation by EL which are distributed in LSECs and have phospholipase activity that cleaves the ester linkage present in those lipids. 32,41\n...\nHowever, EL inhibitors such as GSK264220A might induce systemic side effects due to their interference with the physiological roles of EL in lipid metabolism. 44 Therefore, it would be more efficient to develop an LNP formulation for which the pKa value of the membrane would be optimal for targeting LSECs using lipase-resistant lipids. \n\nThere are two possible strategies for optimizing the pKa of an LNP membrane for LSECs targeting. The first strategy is the synthesis of various lipids with different chemical structures and pKa values for use in preparing LNPs with a wide range of membrane pKa values and screen the uptake and activity of each in LSECs. However, this method is time-and effort-consuming, not cost-effective, and results in limited pKa adjustments. Therefore, we adopted a more effective strategy, which involved mixing two lipids at different molar ratios with low and high pKa values in several LNP formulations to permit the pKa value of the final LNP membrane. These lipids are YSK05 (a pH-sensitive cationic lipid with a pKa value of 6.50), and YSK12-C4 (a highly cationic lipid with a pKa value of 8.00). Their chemical structures are shown in Figure 1. These lipids were chosen because they have a strong endosomal escape, strong activity (YSK05 in hepatocytes, in vivo, 33 and YSK12-C4 in dendritic cells, in vitro 36 ), and are resistant to the action of lipases.

                    "text": "Upon entering the blood stream, nanoparticles rapidly absorb serum proteins on their surface. The effects of protein corona heavily control the biodistribution of nanoparticles. For some LNPs, ApoE adsorption is essential for the cellular uptake of LNPs. Akinc et al. (15) have described the role of ApoE in the in vivo uptake of LNPs by hepatocytes. They compared the uptake of LNPs by hepatocytes in wild-type and ApoE knockout mice. The activity of LNPs was remarkably reduced in ApoE knockout (ApoE \u2212/\u2212 ) mice compared to wild-type mice. Since the major cell population in the liver is hepatocytes and they overexpress LDLR, an alternative targeting ligand is necessary for LSEC-specific delivery of RNA other than the ApoE. Previously, specific targeting ligands were evaluated for enhancing the selective delivery of LNPs to target cells (15). Kumar et al. (36) showed decreased activity of LNPs with higher PEG-lipid content in hepatocytes due to reduced association of ApoE with LNPs. They showed that LNPs with 5% PEG-lipid have a lower binding affinity with ApoE compared to LNPs with 1.5% PEG-lipid. By introducing unique targeting ligands to the highly PEGylated LNPs, ApoE-mediated cellular uptake can be blocked and selective delivery of LNPs can be achieved. \n\nAmong various liver cells, LSECs are substantial targets for RNA therapeutics because LSECs are closely related to fetal liver diseases resulting from LSECs-derived gene products (17,19). To achieve the selective delivery of LNPs to LSECs, we introduced LSEC-specific ligands to highly PEGylated LNPs. Mannose receptor is one of the receptors that specifically expressed on human and mice LSECs (17). Mannose-conjugated nanoparticles have been investigated in various targeted delivery studies, and these nanoparticles have been proven to be safe (37,38).",

Although LNPs are particularly advantageous for in vivo delivery, systemic delivery of RNA therapeutics other than liver hepatocytes remains highly challenging. \n\nThe liver consists of two major types of cells, including parenchymal cells (e.g., hepatocytes) and nonparenchymal cells [e.g., liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), Kupffer cells, and stellate cells] (16)(17)(18)(19). Given their physiological differences, a cell type-specific delivery of RNA in the liver requires a precise engineering of LNPs. For example, LSECs have the highest endocytic capacity without a basement membrane, making them the most permeable among liver cells (20). LSECs have many fenestrae, allowing the facile transport of macromolecules between sinusoidal lumen and hepatocytes. Because of the average diameter of liver fenestrae (~100 nm in human and ~140 nm in mouse), only small nanoparticles can penetrate through these holes (21). Chen and coworkers (22) previously reported the effect of particle size on the in vivo potency of LNPs in the liver. They showed that the particle size heavily influenced the gene delivery efficacy of LNPs, as well as the stability of LNPs during blood circulation. \n\nNanoparticles that cannot penetrate through the fenestrae are taken up by different types of liver cells such as LSECs and Kupffer cells. It was shown that LNPs with larger particle size can be delivered to LSECs and induced Tie2 gene silencing (23). The size and composition of LNPs can help the endothelium-specific delivery; however, the detailed mechanism of cell-specific uptake is not well understood.",

                    "text": "The size and composition of LNPs can help the endothelium-specific delivery; however, the detailed mechanism of cell-specific uptake is not well understood. Therefore, targeting specific cells in the liver requires an alternative strategy other than adjusting the physical size and composition of the LNPs. Ligand incorporation can be an ideal approach for selective delivery of RNA therapeutics to targeted liver cells. LSECs play an important role in scavenger system and express selective receptors such as stabilin receptors, mannose receptors, and Fc-\uf067RIIb2 (17). These receptors are involved in the removal of blood-borne antigens by active endocytosis. For example, phosphorothioate-modified antisense oligonucleotides or hyaluronic acid-conjugated nanoparticles were successfully delivered to LSECs by targeting the scavenger receptors (24,25). \n\nIn this study, we report the engineered LNP formulations for the targeted delivery of RNA into different types of cells in the liver. Hepatocytes and LSECs are two major cells involved in various liver-related diseases. Hepatocytes are often associated with rare diseases in metabolism and endocrine dysfunctions, while LSECs are closely related with chronic liver diseases such as liver fibrosis and cirrhosis (19,26,27). It is important to selectively target the liver cells in different diseases, and its selectivity becomes more critical when introducing in vivo gene regulation and editing. Here, ionizable lipids were first synthesized and screened for their pK a (where K a is the acid dissociation constant) and endolytic activities. Selected lipid candidates were further evaluated for in vitro and in vivo gene expression after formulating LNPs with reporter mRNA [firefly luciferase (FLuc)]. Targeted delivery of LNPs with mRNA (Cre) in different types of cells in the liver was examined by controlling the particle size and PEG-lipid content of LNPs. In addition, engineered LNPs with mannose moieties were prepared for active targeting of LSECs. Optimized condition for the targeted delivery of mRNA to LSECs was lastly confirmed.",

                    "text": "A platform technology that delivers RNA therapeutics to targeted cells has great potential for treating various liver diseases associated with different types of cells in the liver. In particular, LSECs participate in initiation and progression of chronic liver diseases by change in their pathological characteristics in response to chemical toxins, cytokines, and inflammatory stimuli (17,19). Previous studies have shown that targeting endothelial sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor-1 and Bax in LSECs could also reduce apoptosis of LSECs and eventually reduced acute hepatic failure (43,44). The conjugation of hyaluronan, KLGR peptide, and mannose resulted in increased uptake of nano particles into LSECs compared to nonconjugated groups. Moreover, previously reported studies have confirmed that LNPs can be delivered to different tissue by changing LNP formulations. Some of these formulations showed increased mRNA delivery to LSECs without targeting ligands (45). Nevertheless, its selectivity remained not well understood (37). \n\nTo translate the targeted delivery to LSECs, ApoE-dependent cellular uptake must be replaced by alternative ligand selection and incorporation. Upon entering blood circulation system, LNPs can be readily delivered to hepatocytes and LSECs by ApoE-dependent cellular uptake. However, delivery efficacy of LNPs in LSECs is significantly less than that of hepatocytes (23). Here, we demonstrated a targeted delivery of RNA to LSECs by incorporating active ligands to LNPs. The mannose ligand can interact with specific receptors (CD206) expressed on LSECs. We have shown that incorporation of mannose to LNPs with high PEG-lipid content (3%) allowed selective delivery of mRNA/siRNA only to LSECs through mannose-CD206 interaction. It is likely that, when PEGlipid content is high enough, the ApoE-mediated cellular uptake is mostly reduced, while mannose-CD206 interaction becomes predominant for the cellular entry of LNPs. Moreover, mannoseincorporated LNPs showed bigger physical size than the diameter of the fenestrae.",

Kim, M. Jeong, S. Hur, Y. Cho, J. Park, H. Jung, Y. Seo, H. Woo, K. Nam, K. Lee, H. Lee\n## Abstract\nEngineered ionizable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) were developed for the LSEC-specific delivery of RNA therapeutics. Ionizable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been widely used for in vivo delivery of RNA therapeutics into the liver. However, a main challenge remains to develop LNP formulations for selective delivery of RNA into certain types of liver cells, such as hepatocytes and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). Here, we report the engineered LNPs for the targeted delivery of RNA into hepatocytes and LSECs. The effects of particle size and polyethylene glycol\u2013lipid content in the LNPs were evaluated for the hepatocyte-specific delivery of mRNA by ApoE-mediated cellular uptake through low-density lipoprotein receptors. Targeted delivery of RNA to LSECs was further investigated using active ligands. Incorporation of mannose allowed the selective delivery of RNA to LSECs, while minimizing the unwanted cellular uptake by hepatocytes. These results demonstrate that engineered LNPs have great potential for the cell type\u2013specific delivery of RNA into the liver and other tissues.\n## INTRODUCTION\nThe mechanism of cellular uptake was well investigated, and adsorption of serum ApoE (apolipoprotein E) on the surface of LNPs was a major effector facilitating the intracellular delivery of LNPs into hepatocytes through low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors (15). Although LNPs are particularly advantageous for in vivo delivery, systemic delivery of RNA therapeutics other than liver hepatocytes remains highly challenging. \n\nThe liver consists of two major types of cells, including parenchymal cells (e.g., hepatocytes) and nonparenchymal cells [e.g., liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), Kupffer cells, and stellate cells] (16)(17)(18)(19). Given their physiological differences, a cell type-specific delivery of RNA in the liver requires a precise engineering of LNPs. For example, LSECs have the highest endocytic capacity without a basement membrane, making them the most permeable among liver cells (20). LSECs have many fenestrae, allowing the facile transport of macromolecules between sinusoidal lumen and hepatocytes. Because of the average diameter of liver fenestrae (~100 nm in human and ~140 nm in mouse), only small nanoparticles can penetrate through these holes (21). Chen and coworkers (22) previously reported the effect of particle size on the in vivo potency of LNPs in the liver. They showed that the particle size heavily influenced the gene delivery efficacy of LNPs, as well as the stability of LNPs during blood circulation. \n\nNanoparticles that cannot penetrate through the fenestrae are taken up by different types of liver cells such as LSECs and Kupffer cells. It was shown that LNPs with larger particle size can be delivered to LSECs and induced Tie2 gene silencing (23). The size and composition of LNPs can help the endothelium-specific delivery; however, the detailed mechanism of cell-specific uptake is not well understood.\n...\nThe size and composition of LNPs can help the endothelium-specific delivery; however, the detailed mechanism of cell-specific uptake is not well understood. Therefore, targeting specific cells in the liver requires an alternative strategy other than adjusting the physical size and composition of the LNPs. Ligand incorporation can be an ideal approach for selective delivery of RNA therapeutics to targeted liver cells. LSECs play an important role in scavenger system and express selective receptors such as stabilin receptors, mannose receptors, and Fc-\uf067RIIb2 (17). These receptors are involved in the removal of blood-borne antigens by active endocytosis. For example, phosphorothioate-modified antisense oligonucleotides or hyaluronic acid-conjugated nanoparticles were successfully delivered to LSECs by targeting the scavenger receptors (24,25). \n\nIn this study, we report the engineered LNP formulations for the targeted delivery of RNA into different types of cells in the liver. Hepatocytes and LSECs are two major cells involved in various liver-related diseases. Hepatocytes are often associated with rare diseases in metabolism and endocrine dysfunctions, while LSECs are closely related with chronic liver diseases such as liver fibrosis and cirrhosis (19,26,27). It is important to selectively target the liver cells in different diseases, and its selectivity becomes more critical when introducing in vivo gene regulation and editing. Here, ionizable lipids were first synthesized and screened for their pK a (where K a is the acid dissociation constant) and endolytic activities. Selected lipid candidates were further evaluated for in vitro and in vivo gene expression after formulating LNPs with reporter mRNA [firefly luciferase (FLuc)]. Targeted delivery of LNPs with mRNA (Cre) in different types of cells in the liver was examined by controlling the particle size and PEG-lipid content of LNPs. In addition, engineered LNPs with mannose moieties were prepared for active targeting of LSECs. Optimized condition for the targeted delivery of mRNA to LSECs was lastly confirmed.\n\n## of 12\nindicated that higher PEG content hindered the ApoE adsorption, thus resulting in the decrease of luciferase expression in mFLuc-loaded LNP-injected mice (fig. S7). \n\nPotent tdTomato fluorescence in LSECs was observed for LNPs with 100 nm in size (1.0% PEG-lipid) that is similar to the diameter of fenestrae. However, the uptake of LNPs by LSECs was decreased correspondingly with the reduction in LNP size (60 nm). It is likely that more LNPs are directed to hepatocytes through fenestrae rather than interacting with LSECs for cellular entry. Again, with higher PEG-lipid content of 3% or more, a poor ApoE association would be the cause of reduced tdTomato fluorescence. These results confirmed the importance of size and PEG-lipid content of LNPs governing their delivery efficacy to hepatocytes and LSECs. Unfortunately, LNPs with 1.0% PEG-lipid content not only showed increased LNP delivery into LSECs but also resulted in potent cellular uptake by hepatocytes. It would be difficult to achieve LSECspecific delivery of RNA by controlling size and PEG-lipid content of LNPs. Therefore, a different strategy was needed.\n\n## Active targeting of LSECs using ligand-incorporated LNPs\nUpon entering the blood stream, nanoparticles rapidly absorb serum proteins on their surface. The effects of protein corona heavily control the biodistribution of nanoparticles. For some LNPs, ApoE adsorption is essential for the cellular uptake of LNPs. Akinc et al. (15) have described the role of ApoE in the in vivo uptake of LNPs by hepatocytes. They compared the uptake of LNPs by hepatocytes in wild-type and ApoE knockout mice. The activity of LNPs was remarkably reduced in ApoE knockout (ApoE \u2212/\u2212 ) mice compared to wild-type mice. Since the major cell population in the liver is hepatocytes and they overexpress LDLR, an alternative targeting ligand is necessary for LSEC-specific delivery of RNA other than the ApoE. Previously, specific targeting ligands were evaluated for enhancing the selective delivery of LNPs to target cells (15). Kumar et al. (36) showed decreased activity of LNPs with higher PEG-lipid content in hepatocytes due to reduced association of ApoE with LNPs. They showed that LNPs with 5% PEG-lipid have a lower binding affinity with ApoE compared to LNPs with 1.5% PEG-lipid. By introducing unique targeting ligands to the highly PEGylated LNPs, ApoE-mediated cellular uptake can be blocked and selective delivery of LNPs can be achieved. \n\nAmong various liver cells, LSECs are substantial targets for RNA therapeutics because LSECs are closely related to fetal liver diseases resulting from LSECs-derived gene products (17,19). To achieve the selective delivery of LNPs to LSECs, we introduced LSEC-specific ligands to highly PEGylated LNPs. Mannose receptor is one of the receptors that specifically expressed on human and mice LSECs (17). Mannose-conjugated nanoparticles have been investigated in various targeted delivery studies, and these nanoparticles have been proven to be safe (37,38).\n...\nNotably, compared with LNPs with 3.0% PEG-lipid, mannose-incorporated LNPs showed the substantial decrease of tdTomato fluorescence in hepatocytes. While some discussion exists about the expression of CD206 on the surface of mice Kupffer cells, in our data, incorporation of mannose seemed to have little effect on the uptake of the LNPs by the Kupffer cells. These results demonstrated a highly effective targeting strategy to LSECs using mannose-incorporated LNPs. \n\nNext, we confirmed the selective targeting of siRNA-loaded LNPs with mannose to LSECs. LNPs were formulated with 1.5% PEG-lipid (with 1.0% mannose-PEG lipid) and 3.0% PEG-lipid (with 2.5% mannose-PEG lipid) for targeting LSECs and compared the FVIII gene silencing efficiency to that of LNPs with PEG-lipid only. As shown in Fig. 8 (A and C), similar to that of mRNA-loaded LNPs, LNPs with mannose-PEG lipid resulted in slightly bigger size than LNPs with PEG-lipid only. The prepared LNPs with siFVIII were injected into C57BL/6 mice at the dose of 0.5 mg/kg. After 2 days of injection, blood was collected and the level of FVIII protein in serum was validated. As shown in Fig. 8B, addition of mannose-PEG lipid into LNPs with 3% total PEG-lipid content showed a more enhanced FVIII inhibition in LSECs. On the contrary, for 1.5% PEG-lipid, incorporation of mannose to LNPs was less significant. This could be due to high ApoE adsorption at lower PEG content that facilitated the ApoE/LDLR-mediated uptake of LNPs. In addition, we further compared the LNP uptake using mannose-PEG lipid with that of galactose-PEG lipid. As expected, galactose-incorporated LNPs showed similar diameter of mannose-incorporated LNPs.\n\n## DISCUSSION\nA platform technology that delivers RNA therapeutics to targeted cells has great potential for treating various liver diseases associated with different types of cells in the liver. In particular, LSECs participate in initiation and progression of chronic liver diseases by change in their pathological characteristics in response to chemical toxins, cytokines, and inflammatory stimuli (17,19). Previous studies have shown that targeting endothelial sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor-1 and Bax in LSECs could also reduce apoptosis of LSECs and eventually reduced acute hepatic failure (43,44). The conjugation of hyaluronan, KLGR peptide, and mannose resulted in increased uptake of nano particles into LSECs compared to nonconjugated groups. Moreover, previously reported studies have confirmed that LNPs can be delivered to different tissue by changing LNP formulations. Some of these formulations showed increased mRNA delivery to LSECs without targeting ligands (45). Nevertheless, its selectivity remained not well understood (37). \n\nTo translate the targeted delivery to LSECs, ApoE-dependent cellular uptake must be replaced by alternative ligand selection and incorporation. Upon entering blood circulation system, LNPs can be readily delivered to hepatocytes and LSECs by ApoE-dependent cellular uptake. However, delivery efficacy of LNPs in LSECs is significantly less than that of hepatocytes (23). Here, we demonstrated a targeted delivery of RNA to LSECs by incorporating active ligands to LNPs. The mannose ligand can interact with specific receptors (CD206) expressed on LSECs. We have shown that incorporation of mannose to LNPs with high PEG-lipid content (3%) allowed selective delivery of mRNA/siRNA only to LSECs through mannose-CD206 interaction. It is likely that, when PEGlipid content is high enough, the ApoE-mediated cellular uptake is mostly reduced, while mannose-CD206 interaction becomes predominant for the cellular entry of LNPs. Moreover, mannoseincorporated LNPs showed bigger physical size than the diameter of the fenestrae.\n...\nMoreover, mannoseincorporated LNPs showed bigger physical size than the diameter of the fenestrae. This additionally reduced the uptake of LNPs to hepatocytes and allowed more selective uptake into the LSECs. Collectively, our results successfully demonstrated the targeted delivery of RNA into different types of cells in the liver by controlling physical size of LNPs, PEG-lipid content, and incorporation of active targeting ligands. Overall, this approach may offer new strategies to develop cell type-specific delivery of RNA in the liver and other tissues.",

Inspired by the four-component formula of classical LNPs, the selective organ-targeting (SORT) strategy, first reported by Daniel J. Siegwart's group, has been reported, which involves the incorporation of a complementary component, known as the SORT molecule, in classical fourcomposition LNPs (Figure 1D). 42",

The mechanism by which these nanoparticles target and deliver nucleic acids to the lung may be due to association with a protein or group of proteins that binds to the surface of the nanoparticles and selectively delivers them to the pulmonary endothelium [95,190].

            "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) represent a significant global health burden, demanding innovative therapeutic approaches. In recent years, mRNA therapeutics have emerged as a promising strategy to combat CVDs effectively. Unlike conventional small-molecule drugs, mRNA therapeutics enable the direct modulation of cellular functions by delivering specific mRNA molecules to target cells. This approach offers unprecedented advantages, including the ability to harness endogenous cellular machinery for protein synthesis, thus allowing precise control over gene expression without insertion into the genome. This review summarizes the current status of the potential of cell-specific mRNA therapeutics in the context of cardiovascular diseases. First, it outlines the challenges associated with traditional CVD treatments and emphasizes the need for targeted therapies. Subsequently, it elucidates the underlying principles of mRNA therapeutics and the development of advanced delivery systems to ensure cell-specificity and enhanced efficacy. Notably, innovative delivery methods such as lipid nanoparticles and exosomes have shown promise in improving the targeted delivery of mRNA to cardiac cells, activated fibroblasts, and other relevant cell types. Furthermore, the review highlights the diverse applications of cell-specific mRNA therapeutics in addressing various aspects of cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and arrhythmias. By modulating key regulatory genes involved in cardiomyocyte proliferation, inflammation, angiogenesis, tissue repair, and cell survival, mRNA therapeutics hold the potential to intervene at multiple stages of CVD pathogenesis. Despite its immense potential, this abstract acknowledges the challenges in translating cell-specific mRNA therapeutics from preclinical studies to clinical applications like off-target effects and delivery.

In recent years, mRNA therapeutics have emerged as a promising strategy to combat CVDs effectively. Unlike conventional small-molecule drugs, mRNA therapeutics enable the direct modulation of cellular functions by delivering specific mRNA molecules to target cells. This approach offers unprecedented advantages, including the ability to harness endogenous cellular machinery for protein synthesis, thus allowing precise control over gene expression without insertion into the genome. This review summarizes the current status of the potential of cell-specific mRNA therapeutics in the context of cardiovascular diseases. First, it outlines the challenges associated with traditional CVD treatments and emphasizes the need for targeted therapies. Subsequently, it elucidates the underlying principles of mRNA therapeutics and the development of advanced delivery systems to ensure cell-specificity and enhanced efficacy. Notably, innovative delivery methods such as lipid nanoparticles and exosomes have shown promise in improving the targeted delivery of mRNA to cardiac cells, activated fibroblasts, and other relevant cell types. Furthermore, the review highlights the diverse applications of cell-specific mRNA therapeutics in addressing various aspects of cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and arrhythmias. By modulating key regulatory genes involved in cardiomyocyte proliferation, inflammation, angiogenesis, tissue repair, and cell survival, mRNA therapeutics hold the potential to intervene at multiple stages of CVD pathogenesis. Despite its immense potential, this abstract acknowledges the challenges in translating cell-specific mRNA therapeutics from preclinical studies to clinical applications like off-target effects and delivery. In conclusion, cell-specific mRNA therapeutics have emerged as a revolutionary gene therapy approach for CVD, offering targeted interventions with the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes.\n## Organ-Specific LNPs\nIn the context of systemic delivery for protein replacement therapy, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) in blood serum has been identified to facilitate liver homing of intravenously injected lipid nanoparticles (LNPs).

The results showed that intravenous delivery is the most commonly used route, demonstrating its effectiveness in targeting liver cells. Key observations, listed below, show the influence of lipid components, surface chemistry, and target cell interactions. \n\n(1) Ionizable lipids contributed to increased endosomal escape and liver-specific delivery. Lipids, such as MC3 and cKK-E12, had specific pKa values optimized for hepatocyte uptake. 32,67 Importantly, tail length affected organ distribution. For example, shorter tails targeted the spleen, and longer tails favored liver uptake. 67 Formulations such as 5A2-SC8 and 3A5-SC14 showed different targeting behavior; e.g., 5A2-SC8 enhanced ApoEmediated hepatocyte delivery, while 3A5-SC14 favored Kupffer cell uptake. 36 2) Helper lipids, such as DOPE and DSPC, impacted biodistribution. For example, DOPE improved ApoE-mediated liver uptake, while DSPC directed transport to the spleen, showing how fine-tuning LNPs allowed for specific targeting. 23,24 3) Cholesterol stabilizes LNPs and also influences targeting. Esterified cholesterol improved endothelial delivery, while oxidized cholesterol favored Kupffer cells and immune cells, reducing hepatocyte interaction. 68,69 Cationic cholesterol further facilitated delivery to both the liver and extrahepatic tissues, e.g., the lungs and heart. 70 (4) Surface chemistry was important for targeting efficiency. PEG lipids improved circulation, while sheddable variants (e.g., pH-sensitive or enzymatically cleavable PEG) helped target the liver. Mannose-PEG, on the other hand, enhanced receptor-specific delivery to LSECs. 23 pH-sensitive PEGylated lipids increased the stability of the formulation and enabled efficient liver genome editing. 71 Siloxane-incorporated lipidoids also improved endosomal escape and liver-specific mRNA delivery. 72",

LNPs accumulated broadly across these cell types, though functional mRNA delivery was notably higher in liver endothelial cells than in Kupffer cells or hepatocytes. Liver endothelial cells, with their distinctive discontinuous vasculature, act as a gateway, allowing LNPs to extravasate into the space of Disse, where they can interact with hepatocytes and other liver cells. Notably, endothelial cell subtypes, for example, CD32High (central venous zone) and CD32Low (periportal zone), showed different interactions with LNPs, with CD32Low cells exhibiting higher accumulation. This spatial distribution and receptor expression in liver endothelial cells influenced LNP uptake and processing, which in turn impacted biodistribution and functional delivery (Figure 3). 0][51] As part of the fibrotic matrix in liver disease, they may also influence how LNPs interact with the immune system. 34",

                    "text": "ECs are highly specified endothelial cells that line the liver sinusoids. Unlike other endothelial cells, LSECs are fenestrated, which allows them to facilitate the transfer of molecules, including LNPs, into the space of Disse, where hepatocytes reside. These fenestrae, small pores around 100-140 nm in diameter, make LSECs highly permeable to small nanoparticles. 34 Once in proximity to hepatocytes, LNPs that successfully bind to ApoE can be taken up via LDL receptors, promoting functional delivery. ApoE is essential for LNPs to target the liver. \n\nIn the bloodstream, ApoE binds to LNPs, forming a protein corona that allows them to be recognized by LDL receptors on hepatocytes. 22,43 The lipid composition of LNPs (e.g., ionizable and helper lipids) also influences ApoE binding efficiency. 22,44 In addition, the efficiency of ApoE-coated LNP uptake is influenced by hepatocyte zonation, as metabolic and cellular differences across liver zones determine the fate and distribution of LNPs. 16 wever, LNPs that fail to bind ApoE or that become coated with other serum proteins may be redirected to non-target cells or cleared by the spleen. 24,36 LSECs also express a variety of receptors, including scavenger receptors (e.g., stabilin-1 and stabilin-2) 45 and mannose receptors, 23 that can mediate the active uptake of functionalized LNPs. For MacParland et al. 34 example, mannose-modified LNPs can selectively bind LSECs, improving RNA therapeutic delivery. 23 In addition, the slow blood flow in liver sinusoids allows more time for LNPs to interact with LSECs. 15 Finally, altering the size, charge, and surface chemistry of LNPs can optimize their interaction with LSECs, with smaller particles (<100 nm) more readily translocated through the fenestrae and internalized. 23",

Understanding of biodistribution and liver-specific tropism\n# Venue: Molecular Therapy: Methods & Clinical Development\n# Authors: M. Hosseini-Kharat, K. Bremmell, C. Prestidge\n## Abstract\nNone\n## INTERACTIONS BETWEEN LIVER CELL TYPES AND LNPs\nECs are highly specified endothelial cells that line the liver sinusoids. Unlike other endothelial cells, LSECs are fenestrated, which allows them to facilitate the transfer of molecules, including LNPs, into the space of Disse, where hepatocytes reside. These fenestrae, small pores around 100-140 nm in diameter, make LSECs highly permeable to small nanoparticles. 34 Once in proximity to hepatocytes, LNPs that successfully bind to ApoE can be taken up via LDL receptors, promoting functional delivery. ApoE is essential for LNPs to target the liver. \n\nIn the bloodstream, ApoE binds to LNPs, forming a protein corona that allows them to be recognized by LDL receptors on hepatocytes. 22,43 The lipid composition of LNPs (e.g., ionizable and helper lipids) also influences ApoE binding efficiency. 22,44 In addition, the efficiency of ApoE-coated LNP uptake is influenced by hepatocyte zonation, as metabolic and cellular differences across liver zones determine the fate and distribution of LNPs. 16 wever, LNPs that fail to bind ApoE or that become coated with other serum proteins may be redirected to non-target cells or cleared by the spleen. 24,36 LSECs also express a variety of receptors, including scavenger receptors (e.g., stabilin-1 and stabilin-2) 45 and mannose receptors, 23 that can mediate the active uptake of functionalized LNPs. For MacParland et al. 34 example, mannose-modified LNPs can selectively bind LSECs, improving RNA therapeutic delivery. 23 In addition, the slow blood flow in liver sinusoids allows more time for LNPs to interact with LSECs. 15 Finally, altering the size, charge, and surface chemistry of LNPs can optimize their interaction with LSECs, with smaller particles (<100 nm) more readily translocated through the fenestrae and internalized. 23\n...\nFinally, altering the size, charge, and surface chemistry of LNPs can optimize their interaction with LSECs, with smaller particles (<100 nm) more readily translocated through the fenestrae and internalized. 23 Given their high endocytic capacity and strategic location in liver sinusoids, LSECs are essential to the liver's clearance of circulating LNPs. \n\nSago et al. 32 investigated how specific liver cell subtypes-Kupffer cells, liver endothelial cells, and hepatocytes-interacted with LNPs. LNPs accumulated broadly across these cell types, though functional mRNA delivery was notably higher in liver endothelial cells than in Kupffer cells or hepatocytes. Liver endothelial cells, with their distinctive discontinuous vasculature, act as a gateway, allowing LNPs to extravasate into the space of Disse, where they can interact with hepatocytes and other liver cells. Notably, endothelial cell subtypes, for example, CD32High (central venous zone) and CD32Low (periportal zone), showed different interactions with LNPs, with CD32Low cells exhibiting higher accumulation. This spatial distribution and receptor expression in liver endothelial cells influenced LNP uptake and processing, which in turn impacted biodistribution and functional delivery (Figure 3). 0][51] As part of the fibrotic matrix in liver disease, they may also influence how LNPs interact with the immune system. 34\n\n## ANALYSIS OF LIVER-TARGETED LNP STUDIES\nKey examples from the literature on liver-targeting LNPs are summarized in Table 2. The results showed that intravenous delivery is the most commonly used route, demonstrating its effectiveness in targeting liver cells. Key observations, listed below, show the influence of lipid components, surface chemistry, and target cell interactions. \n\n(1) Ionizable lipids contributed to increased endosomal escape and liver-specific delivery. Lipids, such as MC3 and cKK-E12, had specific pKa values optimized for hepatocyte uptake. 32,67 Importantly, tail length affected organ distribution. For example, shorter tails targeted the spleen, and longer tails favored liver uptake. 67 Formulations such as 5A2-SC8 and 3A5-SC14 showed different targeting behavior; e.g., 5A2-SC8 enhanced ApoEmediated hepatocyte delivery, while 3A5-SC14 favored Kupffer cell uptake. 36 2) Helper lipids, such as DOPE and DSPC, impacted biodistribution. For example, DOPE improved ApoE-mediated liver uptake, while DSPC directed transport to the spleen, showing how fine-tuning LNPs allowed for specific targeting. 23,24 3) Cholesterol stabilizes LNPs and also influences targeting. Esterified cholesterol improved endothelial delivery, while oxidized cholesterol favored Kupffer cells and immune cells, reducing hepatocyte interaction. 68,69 Cationic cholesterol further facilitated delivery to both the liver and extrahepatic tissues, e.g., the lungs and heart. 70 (4) Surface chemistry was important for targeting efficiency. PEG lipids improved circulation, while sheddable variants (e.g., pH-sensitive or enzymatically cleavable PEG) helped target the liver. Mannose-PEG, on the other hand, enhanced receptor-specific delivery to LSECs. 23 pH-sensitive PEGylated lipids increased the stability of the formulation and enabled efficient liver genome editing. 71 Siloxane-incorporated lipidoids also improved endosomal escape and liver-specific mRNA delivery. 72\n...\nSiloxane-incorporated lipidoids also improved endosomal escape and liver-specific mRNA delivery. 72 5) LNPs proved promising in liver-targeted therapies, enabling applications, e.g., cancer treatment, gene editing, metabolic restoration, and gene silencing. For example, circUGP2 LNPs inhibited tumor progression via p53 activation while partially targeting Kupffer cells. 33 Cre mRNA-loaded COATSOMESS-OP also achieved precise gene editing in hepatocytes (Cre mRNA encodes the Cre recombinase enzyme). 73 Biodegradable LNPs delivered ARG1 mRNA for metabolic restoration in arginase deficiency models, 74 and CL4H6 siRNA-loaded LNPs efficiently silenced hepatocyte genes with high specificity. 75 (6) Target cell specificity is a requirement for successful delivery. \n\nKupffer cells often sequester LNPs, reducing delivery to hepatocytes. However, depletion strategies have been shown to improve hepatocyte targeting by minimizing LNP clearance by Kupffer cells. 35 For example, depletion of Kupffer cells was shown to improve nanoparticle delivery to tumors by up to 150-fold, though the maximum tumor accumulation remains only 2% of the injected dose, demonstrating systemic challenges in nanoparticle targeting. LSECs, because of their fenestrations, facilitated selective delivery, such as for receptor-specific LNPs. 23 7][78] Similarly, targeted therapies using hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/epidermal growth factor (EGF) mRNA and NM-FGF19 mRNA-loaded LNPs successfully treated chronic liver injuries and metabolic dysfunction by delivering therapeutic payloads to specific hepatic cells. 79,80 ecent studies demonstrated new mechanisms for liver-targeted delivery.

However, a major problem remains: the delivery of these CRISPR-derived technologies to specific organs. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have emerged as a very promising delivery method. However, when delivering LNPs intravenously, most of the cargo is trapped by the liver. Alternatively, injecting them directly into organs, such as the brain, requires more invasive procedures. Therefore, developing more specific LNPs is crucial for their future clinical use. Modifying the composition of the lipids in the LNPs allows more specific deliveries of the LNPs to some organs. In this review, we have identified the most effective compositions and proportions of lipids for LNPs to target specific organs, such as the brain, lungs, muscles, heart, liver, spleen, and bones.",

As passive targeting with lipid nanoparticle is a vast subject in itself, in this review we will discuss the types of lipids to use, as well a their proportions, in order to deliver gene therapies to specific organs, especiall extrahepatic ones. By manipulating the composition of lipids (Figure 2) and their proportion in LNPs, it is possible to change their size and surface characteristics. Indeed, the size and charge of LNPs seem to have significant effects on their biodistribution. Therefore, the delivery of the LNPs can be more specific to certain organs. Unfortunately, we still do not clearly understand the precise mechanism that explains the relationship between the biodistribution of LNPs and their size, charge, and the types of lipids used. It would therefore be interesting to conduct fundamental research on this mechanism.

Tremblay\n## Abstract\nGene therapy holds great promise in the treatment of genetic diseases. It is now possible to make DNA modifications using the CRISPR system. However, a major problem remains: the delivery of these CRISPR-derived technologies to specific organs. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have emerged as a very promising delivery method. However, when delivering LNPs intravenously, most of the cargo is trapped by the liver. Alternatively, injecting them directly into organs, such as the brain, requires more invasive procedures. Therefore, developing more specific LNPs is crucial for their future clinical use. Modifying the composition of the lipids in the LNPs allows more specific deliveries of the LNPs to some organs. In this review, we have identified the most effective compositions and proportions of lipids for LNPs to target specific organs, such as the brain, lungs, muscles, heart, liver, spleen, and bones.\n## Introduction\nAlthoug the explanation behind the biodistribution of some LNPs is not fully understood, th scientific literature is replete with several formulations of LNPs having the ability to targe a specific organ. In this review, we have identified the most effective formulations of lipi nanoparticles for passive targeting of specific organs, such as muscles, brain, lungs, live heart, spleen, and bones. Active targeting is another strategy to target specific organs, bu it will not be discussed in this review. For more information on this strategy, Menon et a [37] have published an article on this subject. As passive targeting with lipid nanoparticle is a vast subject in itself, in this review we will discuss the types of lipids to use, as well a their proportions, in order to deliver gene therapies to specific organs, especiall extrahepatic ones. By manipulating the composition of lipids (Figure 2) and their proportion in LNPs, it is possible to change their size and surface characteristics. Indeed, the size and charge of LNPs seem to have significant effects on their biodistribution. Therefore, the delivery of the LNPs can be more specific to certain organs. Unfortunately, we still do not clearly understand the precise mechanism that explains the relationship between the biodistribution of LNPs and their size, charge, and the types of lipids used. It would therefore be interesting to conduct fundamental research on this mechanism. Although the explanation behind the biodistribution of some LNPs is not fully understood, the scientific literature is replete with several formulations of LNPs having the ability to target a specific organ. In this review, we have identified the most effective formulations of lipid nanoparticles for passive targeting of specific organs, such as muscles, brain, lungs, liver, heart, spleen, and bones. Active targeting is another strategy to target specific organs, but it will not be discussed in this review. For more information on this strategy, Menon et al.

The findings from these studies supported the supposition that systemic injection is the best administration route but that targeting sites beyond the liver faces challenges. The liver tropism of lipid nanovehicles is mainly attributed to the following reasons: 1) the blood flow rate through the liver is high, accounting for 27% of cardiac output; 2) sinusoidal membranes in the liver are extensively fenestrated; 3) Kupffer cells, liver-specific macrophages, are responsible for clearing most nanoparticles; and 4) liver endothelial cells present efficient uptake activity 60 .

The findings from these studies supported the supposition that systemic injection is the best administration route but that targeting sites beyond the liver faces challenges. The liver tropism of lipid nanovehicles is mainly attributed to the following reasons: 1) the blood flow rate through the liver is high, accounting for 27% of cardiac output; 2) sinusoidal membranes in the liver are extensively fenestrated; 3) Kupffer cells, liver-specific macrophages, are responsible for clearing most nanoparticles; and 4) liver endothelial cells present efficient uptake activity 60 . In addition to traditional active and passive targeting tactics, innovative strategies have been developed to achieve targeting sites outside the liver (e.g., targeting the spleen, lung, and tumors), including targeting by adjusting the lipid constituents and physicochemical properties of the lipid nanovehicles and biomimetic decoration.",

PEGylated nanocarriers greatly prolong the stability of nanocarriers and solve the nanocarriers' inability to circulate in the blood for a long time [9,10]. However, how to prevent nanocarriers from targeting other organs or tissues besides the liver is an unsolved problem. According to our current understanding, nanomedicines exhibit distinct liver affinity after systematic injection because of their natural physiological advantages, including slow blood flow [11,12] and discontinuous vasculature in hepatic sinusoids [13]. This targeting mechanism is similar to the tumor EPR effect mentioned above, which takes advantage of the discontinuity of vascular endothelium and the retention of nano-sized substances.\n\nIt is exciting to see new advances in the targeting of other organs and tissues besides the liver. James E. Dahlman previously reported a system called Fast Identification of Nanoparticle Delivery (FIND), which is capable of simultaneously quantifying >100 lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) delivering mRNA to multiple cell types in vivo [14]. They quantified more than 250 LNPs in vivo and identified two formulations that deliver RNA to endotheliocytes. The screening system uses designed DNA barcodes and the Cre-Lox animal model. After intravenous administration, flow cytometry and high-throughput sequencing systems are required to determine the cell distribution of different LNPs. Although this is a good screening platform, it is expensive and time consuming, and ordinary researchers may not have the capability to set up such a laboratory. Therefore, a predictable and efficient system to enhance the targeting ability and performance of nanocarriers to target organs is urgently needed.\n\nIn another study, Cheng et al. [15] proposed an intelligent approach called Selective Organ Targeting (SORT), which targets different organs, including the liver, spleen, and lung, based on charge regulation",

Saw, Na Kong\n## Abstract\n<jats:p>\n    \n   </jats:p>\n## SORTing the Fate of Nanodelivery Systems\nspecifically target \u03b1 V \u03b2 3 on the surface of nanocarriers, can significantly increase the tumor targeting ability of nanodrugs [8,9].\n\nOn the whole, to improve the targeting of liposomes, nano-micelles, or other nanocarriers, their stability and targeting should be improved through physical or biochemical methods. PEGylated nanocarriers greatly prolong the stability of nanocarriers and solve the nanocarriers' inability to circulate in the blood for a long time [9,10]. However, how to prevent nanocarriers from targeting other organs or tissues besides the liver is an unsolved problem. According to our current understanding, nanomedicines exhibit distinct liver affinity after systematic injection because of their natural physiological advantages, including slow blood flow [11,12] and discontinuous vasculature in hepatic sinusoids [13]. This targeting mechanism is similar to the tumor EPR effect mentioned above, which takes advantage of the discontinuity of vascular endothelium and the retention of nano-sized substances.\n\nIt is exciting to see new advances in the targeting of other organs and tissues besides the liver. James E. Dahlman previously reported a system called Fast Identification of Nanoparticle Delivery (FIND), which is capable of simultaneously quantifying >100 lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) delivering mRNA to multiple cell types in vivo [14]. They quantified more than 250 LNPs in vivo and identified two formulations that deliver RNA to endotheliocytes. The screening system uses designed DNA barcodes and the Cre-Lox animal model. After intravenous administration, flow cytometry and high-throughput sequencing systems are required to determine the cell distribution of different LNPs. Although this is a good screening platform, it is expensive and time consuming, and ordinary researchers may not have the capability to set up such a laboratory. Therefore, a predictable and efficient system to enhance the targeting ability and performance of nanocarriers to target organs is urgently needed.\n\nIn another study, Cheng et al. [15] proposed an intelligent approach called Selective Organ Targeting (SORT), which targets different organs, including the liver, spleen, and lung, based on charge regulation",

Hepatocytes comprise most of the liver, which also contains Kupffer cells and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). The liver is the main organ to take up synthetic nanoparticles administered systemically. Studies including [63] have shown that preference for hepatocytes over the reticuloendothelial system (RES), which includes Kupffer cells and LSECs, can be tuned by making LNP sizes either smaller or larger than the diameter of the fenestrations in the liver (50-300 nm [104] and 107 \u00b1 1.5 nm [57]). Kim et al. [105] show that grafting mannose onto LNPs allowed for selective delivery of RNA to LSECs while minimizing unwanted cellular uptake by hepatocytes. Interestingly, Saunders et al. [106] exploited the dimensions of the fenestrations in the liver, in an alternate way, to increase LNP accumulation in cells other than the Kupffer cells and LSECs that usually take up a significant portion of nanoparticles administered systemically [107]. Specifically, Saunders et al. [106] administered non-toxic liposomes, termed nanoprimers, that were larger than the fenestrae of the liver capillaries and designed to transiently occupy RES cells in the liver prior to LNP administration. This strategy improved LNP nucleic acid-mediated knockdown and translation efficiency of targets in hepatocytes.",

Kulkarni, D. Witzigmann, Marianne Lind, K. Petersson, J. Simonsen\n## Abstract\nNone\n## Liver targeting\nThe most successful liver-targeting LNPs is likely Onpattro \u00d2 , which was designed to exploit apoE binding to LNP in circulation to deliver siRNA to hepatocytes via the LDLR receptor. Hepatocytes comprise most of the liver, which also contains Kupffer cells and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). The liver is the main organ to take up synthetic nanoparticles administered systemically. Studies including [63] have shown that preference for hepatocytes over the reticuloendothelial system (RES), which includes Kupffer cells and LSECs, can be tuned by making LNP sizes either smaller or larger than the diameter of the fenestrations in the liver (50-300 nm [104] and 107 \u00b1 1.5 nm [57]). Kim et al. [105] show that grafting mannose onto LNPs allowed for selective delivery of RNA to LSECs while minimizing unwanted cellular uptake by hepatocytes. Interestingly, Saunders et al. [106] exploited the dimensions of the fenestrations in the liver, in an alternate way, to increase LNP accumulation in cells other than the Kupffer cells and LSECs that usually take up a significant portion of nanoparticles administered systemically [107]. Specifically, Saunders et al. [106] administered non-toxic liposomes, termed nanoprimers, that were larger than the fenestrae of the liver capillaries and designed to transiently occupy RES cells in the liver prior to LNP administration. This strategy improved LNP nucleic acid-mediated knockdown and translation efficiency of targets in hepatocytes.",

The addition of oxidized cholesterol to LNP shifted liver uptake away from hepatocytes and into the hepatic microenvironment, including Kupffer cells and hepatic endothelial cells [30]. The inclusion of constrained lipids in LNP, such as adamantyl phospholipids, has also been shown to target hepatic Kupffer cells [31]. Apart from charge and composition, size can also influence hepatocyte transfection, presumably due to the hepatic architecture, with narrow sinusoidal fenestration pores of ~100 nm [32]; LNP > ~200 nm dramatically diminishes hepatocyte transfection [33]. \n\nAlternatives to LNP modification have also been attempted to prevent liver accumulation. In one example, a liposome termed a \"nanoprimer\" was used to saturate Kupffer cell-mediated clearance 10 min prior to administration of LNP containing Cy5.5 labeled human erythropoietin mRNA or factor VII siRNA, resulting in increased systemic fluorescence at 1 h post-dose and increased erythropoietin or decreased factor VII protein expression at 48 h post-dose, respectively [34]. Clever mRNA modifications have also been made in an attempt to reduce off-target liver expression by the design of hepatic-selective, suppressive micro-RNA (miRNA) binding sites into the untranslated regions of the mRNA [35].",

The targeting is achieved by altering the inherent characteristics of the nanoparticles, such as their sizes, surface charges, and protein coronas. 147 For example, smaller, negatively charged LNPs translocate more efficiently and deeper into the lymph nodes. 147 7C1, a low molecular weight polyamine and lipid formulation preferentially delivers siRNA to endothelial cells in vivo when administered intravenously. 148 However, in comparison with active targeting strategies, the molecular reasoning behind why passive targeting strategies work remains unclear. A recently developed polylipoic acid PNP by Castellani et al. termed F127@PLA-NP was shown to preferentially accumulate in the myocardium when delivered intravenously in mice due to passive targeting. 149 Interestingly, the antioxidant properties of the lipoic acid were demonstrated to exhibit cardioprotection against post-ischemia reperfusion in vitro. Despite these findings, the authors were unable to elucidate the underlying mechanism resulting in the myocardial accumulation. \n\nWhile the search for active targeting strategies starts with a hypothetical modification that enhances targeting due to known interactions with cell types of interest, passive targeting strategies are better uncovered by systematically testing various modifications and molar ratios. Cheng et al. developed the novel strategy of selective organ targeting (SORT) LNPs, which were traditional LNPs modified with an additional supplemental component, termed SORT lipid (cationic, anionic, or uncharged). 150 By systematically testing various modifications of the SORT LNP components including the SORT lipid, they demonstrated tissue-specific targeting of the lung, spleen, or liver when injected intravenously. Similarly, Ni et al. systematically showed that utilizing specific types of piperazine-derived lipids, in combination with specific molar ratios for the individual components of LNPs, can deliver cargo preferentially to non-hepatocytes in vivo, most notably to liver and spleen immune cells at low dosage (0.3 mg/kg). 151",

Soh\n## Abstract\nNone\n## Review\nOn the other hand, passive targeting is the preferential targeting of the delivery systems to specific organs and cell types without the need for antibody fragments, peptides, or other ligands that bind cell-surface receptors. The targeting is achieved by altering the inherent characteristics of the nanoparticles, such as their sizes, surface charges, and protein coronas. 147 For example, smaller, negatively charged LNPs translocate more efficiently and deeper into the lymph nodes. 147 7C1, a low molecular weight polyamine and lipid formulation preferentially delivers siRNA to endothelial cells in vivo when administered intravenously. 148 However, in comparison with active targeting strategies, the molecular reasoning behind why passive targeting strategies work remains unclear. A recently developed polylipoic acid PNP by Castellani et al. termed F127@PLA-NP was shown to preferentially accumulate in the myocardium when delivered intravenously in mice due to passive targeting. 149 Interestingly, the antioxidant properties of the lipoic acid were demonstrated to exhibit cardioprotection against post-ischemia reperfusion in vitro. Despite these findings, the authors were unable to elucidate the underlying mechanism resulting in the myocardial accumulation. \n\nWhile the search for active targeting strategies starts with a hypothetical modification that enhances targeting due to known interactions with cell types of interest, passive targeting strategies are better uncovered by systematically testing various modifications and molar ratios. Cheng et al. developed the novel strategy of selective organ targeting (SORT) LNPs, which were traditional LNPs modified with an additional supplemental component, termed SORT lipid (cationic, anionic, or uncharged). 150 By systematically testing various modifications of the SORT LNP components including the SORT lipid, they demonstrated tissue-specific targeting of the lung, spleen, or liver when injected intravenously. Similarly, Ni et al. systematically showed that utilizing specific types of piperazine-derived lipids, in combination with specific molar ratios for the individual components of LNPs, can deliver cargo preferentially to non-hepatocytes in vivo, most notably to liver and spleen immune cells at low dosage (0.3 mg/kg). 151",

            "abstract": "Today, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are some of the main delivery systems for mRNA-based therapeutics. The scope of LNP applications in terms of RNA is not limited to antiviral vaccines but encompasses anticancer drugs and therapeutics for genetic (including rare) diseases. Such widespread use implies high customizability of targeted delivery of LNPs to specific organs and tissues. This review addresses vector-free options for targeted delivery of LNPs, namely the influence of lipid composition of these nanoparticles on their biodistribution. In the review, experimental studies are examined that are focused on the biodistribution of mRNA or of the encoded protein after mRNA administration via LNPs in mammals. We also performed a comprehensive analysis of individual lipids\u2019 functional groups that ensure biodistribution to desired organs. These data will allow us to outline prospects for further optimization of lipid compositions of nanoparticles for targeted delivery of mRNA therapeutics.",

In the last few years, many studies were focused on targeted delivery of LNPs to organs (mainly to the spleen and lungs) via changes in the charge of the nanoparticles, which is determined by the helper lipid. This strategy is called Selective ORgan Targeting (SORT), and the lipid responsible for the selective delivery of nanoparticles to organs is Lipids ensuring targeting of LNPs to desired organs. \n\nFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org 05 Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org 08 called a SORT-lipid (Cheng et al., 2020). Besides, the SORT strategy can be applied in two ways: complete replacement of a helper lipid or partial replacement (introduction of a fifth component). \n\nIn LoPresti et al. (2022), it was found that complete replacement of a zwitterionic helper lipid with an anionic one induces greater accumulation of LNPs in the spleen as compared to the liver, whereas replacement with a cationic helper lipid leads to LNP accumulation in lungs. It must be noted that the nature of the helper lipid in that report did not have as much influence on nanoparticle biodistribution as did the charge of the lipid's polar head. \n\nIn Cheng et al. (2020); LoPresti et al. ( 2022); Radmand et al. (2023), it has been convincingly proven that the use of a cationic helper lipid drives the accumulation of LNPs in lungs. Besides, in Radmand et al. (2023); Kauffman et al. (2018), it has been demonstrated that the greatest accumulation of LNPs occurs in endothelial cells, which are most accessible to the bloodstream. The effect of cationic lipid DOTAP's proportion in LNPs on the biodistribution of nanoparticles is intriguing, as described in Cheng et al. (2020).",

                    "text": "Improvements in RNA delivery systems based on LNPs yielded impressive results in the last few years. Nevertheless, the use of LNPs for targeted delivery to desired organs still requires optimization of lipid composition. In our review, we discussed successful examples of variations of lipid composition for targeted delivery to the spleen, lungs, pancreas, thyroid gland, placenta, and testes. Distribution of LNPs to the liver is the most typical after intravenous administration, especially for nanoparticles smaller than 100 nm. Through changes in lipid composition, it is possible to achieve preferential (in some cases, complete) redirection of nanoparticle accumulation to other organs. Apparent pK a of LNPs plays an important role in this effect. For instance, nanoparticles having pK a < 5 (they possess a negative charge in the bloodstream) tend to accumulate in the spleen, whereas particles with pK a > 11 (positive charge) in lungs. A desired value of apparent pK a of LNPs can be achieved by changing the helper lipid (SORT technology) and/or by using a combination of several ionizable cationic lipids. Application of bulkier lipids indirectly affects apparent pK a of LNPs by altering the packing of lipids in the nanoparticle and thereby changing the accessibility of ionizable groups of lipids to protonation. Redirection of LNP accumulation to the spleen can be accomplished via reductions in the amount of \"liver-specific\" cholesterol in the nanoparticles. On the other hand, for some organs, such as eyes and the brain, effective delivery systems based on LNPs have not yet been devised, and in this case, delivery to the target organ is achieved only via direct administration of the therapeutic agent. \n\nAt present, computer technologies are actively utilized to design and improve LNPs: from computer modeling to machine learning and artificial intelligence (Du et al., 2023;Maharjan et al., 2023;Cornebise et al., 2021). During the development of new ionizable lipids, the most time-consuming task is the screening of large numbers of diverse LNPs.",

For instance, for nanoparticles containing anionic phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylglycerol, or phosphatidic acid, researchers have observed more specific delivery to the spleen (60%, 50%, and 75%, respectively) than to the liver (20%, 45%, and 5%, respectively) (LoPresti et al., 2022). On the other hand, another group of authors (Pattipeiluhu et al., 2022) has reported that for LNPs containing phosphatidylglycerol, accumulation in the liver occurs predominantly in sinusoidal endothelial cells and Kupffer cells, in contrast to phosphatidylcholine-containing LNPs, whose accumulation takes place equally in hepatocytes, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, and Kupffer cells. \n\nThe introduction of an additional charged helper lipid as a fifth component also enables investigators to alter targeting efficiency of LNPs. Not so long ago (Dilliard et al., 2021), scientists achieved almost 100% reporter mRNA expression in the liver, spleen, or lungs by means of an additional neutral, negatively, or positively charged lipid, respectively. Targeting to an organ depended there on apparent pK a of nanoparticles: at pK a < 5, the particles accumulated mainly in the spleen; at pK a of 6.2-6.4, mainly in the liver; whereas at pK a > 11, mainly in lungs. It is noteworthy that at pK a of 6.5-11, there was selective distribution of LNPs into the lungs and spleen at different levels, indicating a nonobvious dependence of the LNP biodistribution on the charge. It is likely that pK a can serve as a good predictor of bioactivity. For classic fourcomponent LNPs, apparent pK a was 6.3-6.6 in the above study, depending on the ionizable cationic lipid used.",

Ivanov, V. Reshetnikov\n## Abstract\nToday, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are some of the main delivery systems for mRNA-based therapeutics. The scope of LNP applications in terms of RNA is not limited to antiviral vaccines but encompasses anticancer drugs and therapeutics for genetic (including rare) diseases. Such widespread use implies high customizability of targeted delivery of LNPs to specific organs and tissues. This review addresses vector-free options for targeted delivery of LNPs, namely the influence of lipid composition of these nanoparticles on their biodistribution. In the review, experimental studies are examined that are focused on the biodistribution of mRNA or of the encoded protein after mRNA administration via LNPs in mammals. We also performed a comprehensive analysis of individual lipids\u2019 functional groups that ensure biodistribution to desired organs. These data will allow us to outline prospects for further optimization of lipid compositions of nanoparticles for targeted delivery of mRNA therapeutics.\n## Helper lipids\nThe classic composition of LNPs for RNA delivery contains a zwitterionic (neutral) helper phospholipid. In the last few years, many studies were focused on targeted delivery of LNPs to organs (mainly to the spleen and lungs) via changes in the charge of the nanoparticles, which is determined by the helper lipid. This strategy is called Selective ORgan Targeting (SORT), and the lipid responsible for the selective delivery of nanoparticles to organs is Lipids ensuring targeting of LNPs to desired organs. \n\nFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org 05 Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org 08 called a SORT-lipid (Cheng et al., 2020). Besides, the SORT strategy can be applied in two ways: complete replacement of a helper lipid or partial replacement (introduction of a fifth component). \n\nIn LoPresti et al. (2022), it was found that complete replacement of a zwitterionic helper lipid with an anionic one induces greater accumulation of LNPs in the spleen as compared to the liver, whereas replacement with a cationic helper lipid leads to LNP accumulation in lungs. It must be noted that the nature of the helper lipid in that report did not have as much influence on nanoparticle biodistribution as did the charge of the lipid's polar head. \n\nIn Cheng et al. (2020); LoPresti et al. ( 2022); Radmand et al. (2023), it has been convincingly proven that the use of a cationic helper lipid drives the accumulation of LNPs in lungs. Besides, in Radmand et al. (2023); Kauffman et al. (2018), it has been demonstrated that the greatest accumulation of LNPs occurs in endothelial cells, which are most accessible to the bloodstream. The effect of cationic lipid DOTAP's proportion in LNPs on the biodistribution of nanoparticles is intriguing, as described in Cheng et al. (2020).\n...\nAs stated above, targeted delivery of LNPs to organs is determined by the charge, not by the nature of the polar group in a helper lipid. For instance, for nanoparticles containing anionic phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylglycerol, or phosphatidic acid, researchers have observed more specific delivery to the spleen (60%, 50%, and 75%, respectively) than to the liver (20%, 45%, and 5%, respectively) (LoPresti et al., 2022). On the other hand, another group of authors (Pattipeiluhu et al., 2022) has reported that for LNPs containing phosphatidylglycerol, accumulation in the liver occurs predominantly in sinusoidal endothelial cells and Kupffer cells, in contrast to phosphatidylcholine-containing LNPs, whose accumulation takes place equally in hepatocytes, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, and Kupffer cells. \n\nThe introduction of an additional charged helper lipid as a fifth component also enables investigators to alter targeting efficiency of LNPs. Not so long ago (Dilliard et al., 2021), scientists achieved almost 100% reporter mRNA expression in the liver, spleen, or lungs by means of an additional neutral, negatively, or positively charged lipid, respectively. Targeting to an organ depended there on apparent pK a of nanoparticles: at pK a < 5, the particles accumulated mainly in the spleen; at pK a of 6.2-6.4, mainly in the liver; whereas at pK a > 11, mainly in lungs. It is noteworthy that at pK a of 6.5-11, there was selective distribution of LNPs into the lungs and spleen at different levels, indicating a nonobvious dependence of the LNP biodistribution on the charge. It is likely that pK a can serve as a good predictor of bioactivity. For classic fourcomponent LNPs, apparent pK a was 6.3-6.6 in the above study, depending on the ionizable cationic lipid used.\n\n## Concluding remarks and prospects\nImprovements in RNA delivery systems based on LNPs yielded impressive results in the last few years. Nevertheless, the use of LNPs for targeted delivery to desired organs still requires optimization of lipid composition. In our review, we discussed successful examples of variations of lipid composition for targeted delivery to the spleen, lungs, pancreas, thyroid gland, placenta, and testes. Distribution of LNPs to the liver is the most typical after intravenous administration, especially for nanoparticles smaller than 100 nm. Through changes in lipid composition, it is possible to achieve preferential (in some cases, complete) redirection of nanoparticle accumulation to other organs. Apparent pK a of LNPs plays an important role in this effect. For instance, nanoparticles having pK a < 5 (they possess a negative charge in the bloodstream) tend to accumulate in the spleen, whereas particles with pK a > 11 (positive charge) in lungs. A desired value of apparent pK a of LNPs can be achieved by changing the helper lipid (SORT technology) and/or by using a combination of several ionizable cationic lipids. Application of bulkier lipids indirectly affects apparent pK a of LNPs by altering the packing of lipids in the nanoparticle and thereby changing the accessibility of ionizable groups of lipids to protonation. Redirection of LNP accumulation to the spleen can be accomplished via reductions in the amount of \"liver-specific\" cholesterol in the nanoparticles. On the other hand, for some organs, such as eyes and the brain, effective delivery systems based on LNPs have not yet been devised, and in this case, delivery to the target organ is achieved only via direct administration of the therapeutic agent. \n\nAt present, computer technologies are actively utilized to design and improve LNPs: from computer modeling to machine learning and artificial intelligence (Du et al., 2023;Maharjan et al., 2023;Cornebise et al., 2021). During the development of new ionizable lipids, the most time-consuming task is the screening of large numbers of diverse LNPs.",

Functionalization with the three peptide ligands resulted in stable formulations with a greater degree of in vivo internalization in LSECs than non-functionalized PMs. Administration of FPM-Sim in BDL rats reduced toxicity relative to free simvastatin, albeit with a moderate portal-pressure-lowering effect. In a less severe model of TAA-induced cirrhosis, treatment with FPM-CD32b-Sim nanoparticles for two weeks significantly decreased portal pressure, which was associated with a reduction in liver fibrosis, lower collagen expression as well as the stimulation of nitric oxide synthesis. In conclusion, CD32b-FPM stands out as a good nanotransporter for drug delivery, targeting LSECs, key inducers of liver injury.",

This effect was confirmed by the expected overexpression of KLF2 in healthy isolated LSECs treated with free or encapsulated simvastatin. We also ruled out any possible effect of the empty functionalized nanodevices acting only as an inert vehicle for the delivery of the loaded drug. \n\nIntravenous treatment of healthy rats with the different fluorescent formulations confirms that, in all cases, functionalization confers greater efficiency in entering the main liver cells than passive targeting; the capture of FPMs was clearly superior to that achieved by non-functionalized PMs, and LSECs were the liver cells with the highest uptake. Furthermore, in endothelial cells, all three types of functionalization were equally effective. In vivo cell internalization experiments also confirmed that the receptors selected as LSEC targets for our nanoparticles were also expressed in healthy Kupffer cells and hepatocytes, allowing functionalized nanoparticles to enter both cell types quite efficiently. This was expected for CD36 and integrin \u03b1 V \u03b2 3 , as their expression in the liver is elevated not only in LSECs, but also in other hepatic cell types [34,35]. However, CD32b, an Fc\u03b3R conferring LSECs the highest endocytic capacity of any cell in the human body, is known to be the most specific marker of these cells in the liver. Yet, recent studies have shown that CD32b is not only expressed in LSECs but also in Kupffer cells, with a liver level expression of 90% and 10%, respectively [36].",

Maximum tolerated dose assays were performed in healthy mice and efficacy studies of FPM-Sim were carried out in bile duct ligation (BDL) and thioacetamide (TAA) induction rat models of cirrhosis. Functionalization with the three peptide ligands resulted in stable formulations with a greater degree of in vivo internalization in LSECs than non-functionalized PMs. Administration of FPM-Sim in BDL rats reduced toxicity relative to free simvastatin, albeit with a moderate portal-pressure-lowering effect. In a less severe model of TAA-induced cirrhosis, treatment with FPM-CD32b-Sim nanoparticles for two weeks significantly decreased portal pressure, which was associated with a reduction in liver fibrosis, lower collagen expression as well as the stimulation of nitric oxide synthesis. In conclusion, CD32b-FPM stands out as a good nanotransporter for drug delivery, targeting LSECs, key inducers of liver injury.\n## Discussion\nIn vitro internalization in primary cultures of LSECs of the three FPM formulations with the specific ligands for CD32b, CD36 and integrin \u03b1 V \u03b2 3 receptors demonstrated that specific ligand-receptor interactions plus passive targeting promoted uptake by a greater number of healthy LSECs than the micelles conjugated with their scrambled variants. \n\nSimvastatin has been shown to reduce portal hypertension through the putative reduction in IHVR by means of several mechanisms, including the induction of KLF2 expression, related to the stimulation of a vasoprotective phenotype in LSECs [11,12,33]. This effect was confirmed by the expected overexpression of KLF2 in healthy isolated LSECs treated with free or encapsulated simvastatin. We also ruled out any possible effect of the empty functionalized nanodevices acting only as an inert vehicle for the delivery of the loaded drug. \n\nIntravenous treatment of healthy rats with the different fluorescent formulations confirms that, in all cases, functionalization confers greater efficiency in entering the main liver cells than passive targeting; the capture of FPMs was clearly superior to that achieved by non-functionalized PMs, and LSECs were the liver cells with the highest uptake. Furthermore, in endothelial cells, all three types of functionalization were equally effective. In vivo cell internalization experiments also confirmed that the receptors selected as LSEC targets for our nanoparticles were also expressed in healthy Kupffer cells and hepatocytes, allowing functionalized nanoparticles to enter both cell types quite efficiently. This was expected for CD36 and integrin \u03b1 V \u03b2 3 , as their expression in the liver is elevated not only in LSECs, but also in other hepatic cell types [34,35]. However, CD32b, an Fc\u03b3R conferring LSECs the highest endocytic capacity of any cell in the human body, is known to be the most specific marker of these cells in the liver. Yet, recent studies have shown that CD32b is not only expressed in LSECs but also in Kupffer cells, with a liver level expression of 90% and 10%, respectively [36].",

Major drawbacks of conventional therapies in liver metastasis were the lack of metastatic-targeting ability, predominant systemic toxicities and incapability of tumor microenvironment modulations. Lipid nanoparticles-based strategies like galactosylated, lyso-thermosensitive or active-targeting chemotherapeutics liposomes have been explored in liver metastasis management. This review aimed to summarize the state-of-art lipid nanoparticles-based therapies in liver metastasis management. Clinical and translational studies on the lipid nanoparticles in treating liver metastasis were searched up to April, 2023 from online databases. This review focused not only on the updates in drug-encapsulated lipid nanoparticles directly targeting metastatic cancer cells in treating liver metastasis, but more importantly on research frontiers in drug-loading lipid nanoparticles targeting nonparenchymal liver tumor microenvironment components in treating liver metastasis, which showed promise for future clinical oncological practice.",

Therefore, it would be a feasible approach to target nonparenchymal cells in the liver TME for the treatment of liver metastasis. Systemic drug delivery to hepatocytes has successfully led to the approval of Onpattro by the FDA. However, the delivery to other functional nonparenchymal cells in the liver microenvironment remained challenging. Surprisingly, Paunovska et al 75 found that LNPs would be delivered more potently in stromal cells of the liver microenvironment compared to hepatocytes. These findings suggested the feasibility of targeting the liver microenvironment using drugloading liposomal nanoparticles. One of the major deficiencies of the liposomal drug was that it would be easily taken by the reticuloendothelial system, which diminished its circulating time and anti-tumor effect. However, as reticuloendothelial systems were important components of liver TME, 76 the increased uptake of TME-targeting LNPs would increase the concentrations of liposomal therapeutics in hepatic nonparenchymal cells, which led to better therapeutic effects.",

To construct LSEC-targeted RNAi LNPs, Pattipeiluhu et al 80 generated modified Onpattro-like LNPs (srLNPs) which replaced the zwitterionic helper phospholipids in Onpattro with anionic phospholipids. The binding of anionic helper phospholipid on srLNPs to the scavenger receptor stabilin1/2 (stab1/2) on LSECs improved the LSECs-targeting ability. Furthermore, the anionic phospholipid would inhibit the binding of Apo-E on Onpattro to LDL-r on hepatocytes, which redirected the targeting from hepatocytes to LSECs. Cryo-electron microscope showed no major difference in size and ultrastructure between  Onpattro and srLNPs. In vivo biodistribution assay revealed an increased uptake of srLNPs in LSECs compared with Onpattro analog.

Major drawbacks of conventional therapies in liver metastasis were the lack of metastatic-targeting ability, predominant systemic toxicities and incapability of tumor microenvironment modulations. Lipid nanoparticles-based strategies like galactosylated, lyso-thermosensitive or active-targeting chemotherapeutics liposomes have been explored in liver metastasis management. This review aimed to summarize the state-of-art lipid nanoparticles-based therapies in liver metastasis management. Clinical and translational studies on the lipid nanoparticles in treating liver metastasis were searched up to April, 2023 from online databases. This review focused not only on the updates in drug-encapsulated lipid nanoparticles directly targeting metastatic cancer cells in treating liver metastasis, but more importantly on research frontiers in drug-loading lipid nanoparticles targeting nonparenchymal liver tumor microenvironment components in treating liver metastasis, which showed promise for future clinical oncological practice.\n## Liver Tumor Microenvironment Targeted LNP Strategies\nAs illustrated in Figure 2, the TME in the liver has its unique components like liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), Kupffer cells (KCs), and hepatic satellite cells (HSCs), 23 which played an important role in the progression of liver metastasis. 74 Nonparenchymal components of liver sinusoids, like LSECs and HSCs, would assumptively interact with metastatic tumor cells. Therefore, it would be a feasible approach to target nonparenchymal cells in the liver TME for the treatment of liver metastasis. Systemic drug delivery to hepatocytes has successfully led to the approval of Onpattro by the FDA. However, the delivery to other functional nonparenchymal cells in the liver microenvironment remained challenging. Surprisingly, Paunovska et al 75 found that LNPs would be delivered more potently in stromal cells of the liver microenvironment compared to hepatocytes. These findings suggested the feasibility of targeting the liver microenvironment using drugloading liposomal nanoparticles. One of the major deficiencies of the liposomal drug was that it would be easily taken by the reticuloendothelial system, which diminished its circulating time and anti-tumor effect. However, as reticuloendothelial systems were important components of liver TME, 76 the increased uptake of TME-targeting LNPs would increase the concentrations of liposomal therapeutics in hepatic nonparenchymal cells, which led to better therapeutic effects.\n\n## Procedure Liposomal Formulation\nTransarterial chemoembolization Liposomal doxorubicin 55 Bletilla striata polysaccharide polymer 56 Hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy PEG-coated 5-fluorouracil 57 Galactosylated doxorubicin liposomes 59 Radiofrequency ablation Liposomal doxorubicin 63,64 Lyso-thermosensitive Liposomal doxorubicin [65][66][67] Photodynamic therapy IR780@O 2 -SFNs/iRGD 71 ARISP 73 O 2 @PFOB@PGL LNPs 72 \n\nAbbreviation: LNP, lipid nanoparticles. \n\nInternational Journal of Nanomedicine 2023:18 also helped modulate the anti-tumor immune response in liver. 74 8][79] Collectively, LSECs would be a potential target in treating intra-hepatic metastases. To construct LSEC-targeted RNAi LNPs, Pattipeiluhu et al 80 generated modified Onpattro-like LNPs (srLNPs) which replaced the zwitterionic helper phospholipids in Onpattro with anionic phospholipids. The binding of anionic helper phospholipid on srLNPs to the scavenger receptor stabilin1/2 (stab1/2) on LSECs improved the LSECs-targeting ability. Furthermore, the anionic phospholipid would inhibit the binding of Apo-E on Onpattro to LDL-r on hepatocytes, which redirected the targeting from hepatocytes to LSECs. Cryo-electron microscope showed no major difference in size and ultrastructure between  Onpattro and srLNPs. In vivo biodistribution assay revealed an increased uptake of srLNPs in LSECs compared with Onpattro analog. In stab1-/-/stab2-/-mutant zebrafish embryos, srLNPs were found to be free-circulatory rather than taken up by LSECs.",

However, systemically delivering RNA drugs to nonliver tissues remains an important challenge. To increase the number of nanoparticles that could be studied in vivo, we designed a high-throughput method to measure how >100 nanoparticles delivered mRNA that was translated into functional protein in vivo. We quantified how >250 lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) delivered mRNA in vivo, identifying two LNPs that deliver mRNA to endothelial cells. One of the LNPs codelivered Cas9 mRNA and single-guide RNA in vivo, leading to endothelial cell gene editing. This approach can identify nanoparticles that target new cells. Dysfunctional endothelium causes more disease than any other cell type. Systemically administered RNA delivery to nonliver tissues remains challenging, in large part because there is no high-throughput method to identify nanoparticles that deliver functional mRNA to cells in vivo. Here we report a system capable of simultaneously quantifying how >100 lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) deliver mRNA that is translated into functional protein. Using this system (named FIND), we measured how >250 LNPs delivered mRNA to multiple cell types in vivo and identified 7C2 and 7C3, two LNPs that efficiently deliver siRNA, single-guide RNA (sgRNA), and mRNA to endothelial cells. The 7C3 delivered Cas9 mRNA and sgRNA to splenic endothelial cells as efficiently as hepatocytes, distinguishing it from LNPs that deliver Cas9 mRNA and sgRNA to hepatocytes more than other cell types. These data demonstrate that FIND can identify nanoparticles with novel tropisms in vivo.\n",

            "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are leading mRNA delivery vehicles, with ionizable lipids (ILs) as their key component. However, the relationship between the IL structure and LNP endogenous organ-targeting is not well understood. In this study, we developed a novel library of biodegradable ILs featuring beta-propionate linkers, which, when incorporated into a four-component LNP formulation, show excellent extrahepatic selectivity and high protein expression. Methods: We explored the impact of structural modifications in the hydrophobic chains and polar-head groups in the ILs while keeping the linkers unchanged. In vivo results were evaluated to examine how structural changes influence the biodistribution to spleen or lungs. LNP formulations were assessed for their protein expression levels and organ-specific targeting. Additionally, protein corona formation by the best-performing LNPs was examined to provide further mechanistic insights. Results: Organ targeting was significantly influenced by structural changes in the ILs, allowing for precise control of the biodistribution between the spleen and lungs. Branched hydrophobic chains demonstrated a higher propensity for spleen targeting, while modifications in the polar-head group could drastically shift biodistribution from the lung to the spleen. This led to the identification of LNPs\u2019 zeta potential as a key determinant of their extrahepatic targeting properties. Notably, ionizable lipid A3T2C7, also known as CP-LC-1495, displayed strong lung selectivity (97%) and high protein expression in lung tissue (1.21 \u00d7 108 p/s). Similarly, several promising candidates for spleen-targeting LNPs displayed protein expression levels exceeding 1 \u00d7 107 p/s (selectivity >80%). Conclusions: This study elucidates the structure\u2013function relationships of ILs in passive organ-specific mRNA delivery, highlighting how the fine-tuning of hydrophobic chains, polar-head groups, and surface charge (zeta potential) allows for the precise control of LNP endogenous biodistribution, a mechanism influenced by protein corona formation. These findings enable the rational design of targeted LNP systems, enhancing their therapeutic potential for specific organs, such as the spleen and lungs.",

                    "text": "Messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics have demonstrated significant potential in treating cancer, genetic disorders, and infectious diseases, as exemplified by the approval of COVID-19 mRNA or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccines [1][2][3][4]. A critical factor in their success is the use of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), which are among the most advanced and effective delivery systems for nucleic acid therapeutics. LNPs are formulated with a lipid mixture that usually includes an ionizable lipid, cholesterol, a phospholipid, and a polyethylene glycol (PEG)-lipid [5,6]. However, systemic administration of LNPs leads to predominant mRNA expression in the liver, highlighting the need for novel strategies capable of efficiently targeting extrahepatic tissues for therapeutic applications beyond liver-related diseases or vaccines [7][8][9]. \n\nSeveral approaches have been explored for achieving organ-specific mRNA-LNP delivery beyond the liver, focusing on passive (endogenous) and active (ligand-mediated or exogenous) targeting strategies [10]. Active targeting strategies rely on the addition of targeting ligands to the LNP surface, such as antibodies, peptides, or small molecules, to direct the LNP toward certain cell receptors [11]. Conversely, passive targeting depends on the meticulous design of LNPs, adjusting lipid ratios or incorporating additional lipids to promote the formation of a specific endogenous protein corona upon their introduction into the bloodstream. This protein corona effect has been attributed to different LNP properties such as size, apparent pKa, zeta potential, and PEGylation [12,13]. The passive targeting strategies are particularly promising, as they leverage a controlled structure without the need for additional ligands or modifications, hence reducing costs and regulatory hurdles and simplifying the scale-up process [14]. \n\nA well-established approach for passive targeting involves adding a fifth permanently charged lipid-cationic for lung targeting or anionic for spleen targeting-to enable selective organ targeting (SORT) [15,16]. However, this strategy has resulted in limited protein expression levels in targeted organs, indicating potential for further optimization.",

However, the relationship between the IL structure and LNP endogenous organ-targeting is not well understood. In this study, we developed a novel library of biodegradable ILs featuring beta-propionate linkers, which, when incorporated into a four-component LNP formulation, show excellent extrahepatic selectivity and high protein expression. Methods: We explored the impact of structural modifications in the hydrophobic chains and polar-head groups in the ILs while keeping the linkers unchanged. In vivo results were evaluated to examine how structural changes influence the biodistribution to spleen or lungs. LNP formulations were assessed for their protein expression levels and organ-specific targeting. Additionally, protein corona formation by the best-performing LNPs was examined to provide further mechanistic insights. Results: Organ targeting was significantly influenced by structural changes in the ILs, allowing for precise control of the biodistribution between the spleen and lungs. Branched hydrophobic chains demonstrated a higher propensity for spleen targeting, while modifications in the polar-head group could drastically shift biodistribution from the lung to the spleen. This led to the identification of LNPs\u2019 zeta potential as a key determinant of their extrahepatic targeting properties. Notably, ionizable lipid A3T2C7, also known as CP-LC-1495, displayed strong lung selectivity (97%) and high protein expression in lung tissue (1.21 \u00d7 108 p/s). Similarly, several promising candidates for spleen-targeting LNPs displayed protein expression levels exceeding 1 \u00d7 107 p/s (selectivity >80%). Conclusions: This study elucidates the structure\u2013function relationships of ILs in passive organ-specific mRNA delivery, highlighting how the fine-tuning of hydrophobic chains, polar-head groups, and surface charge (zeta potential) allows for the precise control of LNP endogenous biodistribution, a mechanism influenced by protein corona formation. These findings enable the rational design of targeted LNP systems, enhancing their therapeutic potential for specific organs, such as the spleen and lungs.\n## Introduction\nMessenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics have demonstrated significant potential in treating cancer, genetic disorders, and infectious diseases, as exemplified by the approval of COVID-19 mRNA or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccines [1][2][3][4]. A critical factor in their success is the use of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), which are among the most advanced and effective delivery systems for nucleic acid therapeutics. LNPs are formulated with a lipid mixture that usually includes an ionizable lipid, cholesterol, a phospholipid, and a polyethylene glycol (PEG)-lipid [5,6]. However, systemic administration of LNPs leads to predominant mRNA expression in the liver, highlighting the need for novel strategies capable of efficiently targeting extrahepatic tissues for therapeutic applications beyond liver-related diseases or vaccines [7][8][9]. \n\nSeveral approaches have been explored for achieving organ-specific mRNA-LNP delivery beyond the liver, focusing on passive (endogenous) and active (ligand-mediated or exogenous) targeting strategies [10]. Active targeting strategies rely on the addition of targeting ligands to the LNP surface, such as antibodies, peptides, or small molecules, to direct the LNP toward certain cell receptors [11]. Conversely, passive targeting depends on the meticulous design of LNPs, adjusting lipid ratios or incorporating additional lipids to promote the formation of a specific endogenous protein corona upon their introduction into the bloodstream. This protein corona effect has been attributed to different LNP properties such as size, apparent pKa, zeta potential, and PEGylation [12,13]. The passive targeting strategies are particularly promising, as they leverage a controlled structure without the need for additional ligands or modifications, hence reducing costs and regulatory hurdles and simplifying the scale-up process [14]. \n\nA well-established approach for passive targeting involves adding a fifth permanently charged lipid-cationic for lung targeting or anionic for spleen targeting-to enable selective organ targeting (SORT) [15,16]. However, this strategy has resulted in limited protein expression levels in targeted organs, indicating potential for further optimization.",

            "text": "Kupffer cells, as macrophages in the liver, play a key role in immune monitoring and the inflammatory response of the liver. They are mainly responsible for removing particles and pathogens from the blood through phagocytosis [58]. To enhance the uptake of LNPs by Kupffer cells and their immunoregulation ability, research has explored various strategies, including increasing the size of LNPs and modifying the LNP surface with hydrophobic molecules [59]. Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) are located in the sinusoidal space of the liver, where they play important roles in blood filtration, metabolic regulation, antigen presentation, and lipid metabolism. LSECs have a unique structure and function, enabling them to play a crucial role in immune and metabolic processes in the liver [60]. Targeting LNPs to Kupffer cells and LSECs can lead to more effective drug or gene delivery, especially in the treatment of liver diseases. For example, in diseases that require liver-specific treatment, such as hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and liver cancer, this targeted delivery strategy can improve the therapeutic outcomes and reduce unnecessary side-effects. Paunovska et al. [61] explored the use of different types of cholesterol to modify LNPs and reported that the structure of the cholesterol significantly affects the targeting ability of the LNPs. In addition, by using the Fast Identification Nanoparticle Delivery (FIND) system, they screened LNPs formulated with different oxidized cholesterol and observed that LNPs containing oxidized cholesterol can efficiently deliver mRNA to cells in the liver microenvironment, including Kupffer cells and liver endothelial cells. This contrasts with conventional LNPs, which primarily target hepatocytes, and suggests that the targeting of LNPs to specific cell types can be improved by specific chemical modifications. This improved targeting has significant implications for the treatment of liver diseases and the application of immunotherapy.",

            "text": "As the largest digestive organ in the body, the liver plays a central role in metabolism, mainly performed by hepatocytes, one type of parenchymal cells, in which lesion of hepatocytes often causes serious metabolic diseases, such as Wilson disease, Gilben syndrome, etc. In addition, some hepatic non-parenchymal cells, such as liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) also trigger serious hepatic diseases. For instance, LSECs play a key role in the initiation and progression of chronic liver diseases, cirrhosis, and even hepatocellular carcinoma development. 27 ucleic acid drugs offer unique advantages over conventional chemical and protein-based drugs and represent a new approach to treating liver diseases. Targeting hepatocytes is relatively straightforward because LNPs are naturally taken up by hepatocytes through the interaction of serum ApoE adsorbed on the LNPs' surface and LDLR on the hepatocyte surfaces, facilitating cellular endocytosis. 28 Consistent with the theory, unmodified LNPs have been found to be widely distributed in the liver after systemic administration. 29 In addition, the hepatocellular targeting ability of LNPs can be significantly enhanced by optimizing lipid composition and LNPs formulation. For instance, a study by H. Lee and colleagues found that LNPs containing 1.5% PEGylated lipids exhibited approximately 80% transfection efficiency, the highest hepatocyte uptake, among LNPs formulations containing PEGylated lipids ranging from 1 to 3%. 30 Also, it has been reported that by constructing helper lipids 31 and ILs libraries, it was possible to identify mRNA/siRNA-LNPs with superior liver targeting and enrichment properties. James E. Dahlman's group reported that LNPs containing stereopure 20a-hydroxycholesterol (20a) showed a more robust capacity to deliver mRNA to hepatocytes than control at a low dose. 32 However, passive targeting mechanisms via LNPs may not be efficient for patients lacking LDLR.",

            "text": "The most successful liver-targeting LNPs is likely Onpattro \u00d2 , which was designed to exploit apoE binding to LNP in circulation to deliver siRNA to hepatocytes via the LDLR receptor. Hepatocytes comprise most of the liver, which also contains Kupffer cells and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). The liver is the main organ to take up synthetic nanoparticles administered systemically. Studies including [63] have shown that preference for hepatocytes over the reticuloendothelial system (RES), which includes Kupffer cells and LSECs, can be tuned by making LNP sizes either smaller or larger than the diameter of the fenestrations in the liver (50-300 nm [104] and 107 \u00b1 1.5 nm [57]). Kim et al. [105] show that grafting mannose onto LNPs allowed for selective delivery of RNA to LSECs while minimizing unwanted cellular uptake by hepatocytes. Interestingly, Saunders et al. [106] exploited the dimensions of the fenestrations in the liver, in an alternate way, to increase LNP accumulation in cells other than the Kupffer cells and LSECs that usually take up a significant portion of nanoparticles administered systemically [107]. Specifically, Saunders et al. [106] administered non-toxic liposomes, termed nanoprimers, that were larger than the fenestrae of the liver capillaries and designed to transiently occupy RES cells in the liver prior to LNP administration. This strategy improved LNP nucleic acid-mediated knockdown and translation efficiency of targets in hepatocytes.",

            "text": "Kupffer cells play an important role in liver inflammation and immune tolerance, and they clear particles mainly through phagocytosis. It is reported that increasing the size of LNPs and surface modification of LNP with hydrophobic molecules could enhance the cellular uptake and promote immune regulation of Kupffer cells. 84 Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) reside in the liver sinusoids and are responsible for blood filtration, metabolism regulation, antigen presentation, and lipid metabolism. 85 To realize the Kupffer cell or LSECs specific mRNA delivery, Dahlem group applied many different kinds of cholesterol in the prescription of LNP, and found the structure of cholesterol has a great influence on the targeting ability of LNP. 86 They screened LNP formulated with different oxidized cholesterol with fast identification of nanoparticle delivery (FIND) system, and conclude that LNPs containing oxidized cholesterol will deliver mRNA to cells in the liver microenvironment, including Kupffer cells and liver endothelial cells, which is different from the traditional LNP that mainly target to hepatocyte. Considering the important role of Kupffer cells and LSECs in antigen presentation and anti-inflammation effects, this LNP could be further used for immunotherapy. Pattipeiluhu et al. prepared a scavenger receptor LNPs (srLNPs) that could specifically target sinusoidal endothelial cells. 87 Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and Kupffer cells (KCs) are the primary cell types of the hepatic blood vessel and sinusoids, which are responsible for liver homeostasis. Moreover, LSECs can function as antigen-presenting cells for regulating adaptive immunity and immunotolerance, considered a good target for immunotherapy. Based on the previous studies, anionic nanoparticles can be taken up by SECs, which are mediated by the stabilin receptors. Here, they prepared the srLNPs by referring to the composition of Onpattro. The only difference is the zwitterionic lipid DSPC was replaced by anionic lipid DSPG.",

Based on our previous observations, LSECs take up LNPs with higher pKa values, in the pKa range tested (5.70-7.25). 32 However, higher pKa values were not examined and the optimum pKa value for targeting LSECs is not currently known. \n\nWe previously developed an LNP composed of different types of pH-sensitive cationic lipids, namely YSK lipids (referred to as YSK-LNP), to deliver siRNA in vitro and in vivo, particularly in hepatocytes. 33,34 In our previous study, slightly cationic LNP formulations that were composed of lipids with high pKa values, such as YSK13-C4 (pKa 6.80) and YSK15-C4 (pKa 7.10), were found to be highly localized in LSECs as opposed to hepatocytes. 32 Nevertheless, they showed a weak gene silencing activity in LSECs, possibly due to their inactivation by endothelial lipase (EL). 32 his prompted us to investigate the feasibility of targeting LSECs using lipase-resistant LNPs in which the membrane had optimized pKa values.",

            "text": "Intravenous administration of lipid nanoparticles has been the most common route to deliver therapeutic genes to endothelial cells, as these cells are located in the inner surface of blood vessels and are in direct contact with the blood. However, when nanoparticles enter the blood circulation, they are often eliminated by cells of the reticuloendothelial system or preferentially transfect hepatocytes, which prevents nanoparticles from reaching and transfecting endothelial cells [69,94,[186][187][188][189]. As such, strategies have been developed to bypass hepatocytes in order to reach and transfect endothelial cells. Among the strategies developed, the use of cationic lipids or polymers to generate nanoparticles that target endothelial cells has made considerable progress. Dorkin et al. showed that incorporation of the permanently cationic lipid, DOTAP, to LNPs that otherwise target the liver could be redirected to transfect pulmonary endothelial cells [182]. Dorkin et al. also found that liver-targeted lipid nanoparticles, which are nanoparticles that preferentially transfect hepatocytes on their own, specifically C12-200, cKK-E12, and 503O13 nanoparticles, could have a shift in their tropism and transfect pulmonary endothelial cells by incorporating the lipid DOTAP in their formulation [182]. This finding was later expanded by Cheng et al. to include additional cationic lipids, such as DDAB and EPC, to other liver-targeted nanoparticles like 5A2-SC8 and DLin-MC3-DMA to enable transfection of pulmonary endothelial cells [181]. The mechanism by which these nanoparticles target and deliver nucleic acids to the lung may be due to association with a protein or group of proteins that binds to the surface of the nanoparticles and selectively delivers them to the pulmonary endothelium [95,190]. For example, lipid compositions can shift the protein corona abundance away from ApoE, which is a recognized driver of hepatocyte LNP uptake and transfection [191",

            "text": "The mechanism of cellular uptake was well investigated, and adsorption of serum ApoE (apolipoprotein E) on the surface of LNPs was a major effector facilitating the intracellular delivery of LNPs into hepatocytes through low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors (15). Although LNPs are particularly advantageous for in vivo delivery, systemic delivery of RNA therapeutics other than liver hepatocytes remains highly challenging. \n\nThe liver consists of two major types of cells, including parenchymal cells (e.g., hepatocytes) and nonparenchymal cells [e.g., liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), Kupffer cells, and stellate cells] (16)(17)(18)(19). Given their physiological differences, a cell type-specific delivery of RNA in the liver requires a precise engineering of LNPs. For example, LSECs have the highest endocytic capacity without a basement membrane, making them the most permeable among liver cells (20). LSECs have many fenestrae, allowing the facile transport of macromolecules between sinusoidal lumen and hepatocytes. Because of the average diameter of liver fenestrae (~100 nm in human and ~140 nm in mouse), only small nanoparticles can penetrate through these holes (21). Chen and coworkers (22) previously reported the effect of particle size on the in vivo potency of LNPs in the liver. They showed that the particle size heavily influenced the gene delivery efficacy of LNPs, as well as the stability of LNPs during blood circulation. \n\nNanoparticles that cannot penetrate through the fenestrae are taken up by different types of liver cells such as LSECs and Kupffer cells. It was shown that LNPs with larger particle size can be delivered to LSECs and induced Tie2 gene silencing (23). The size and composition of LNPs can help the endothelium-specific delivery; however, the detailed mechanism of cell-specific uptake is not well understood.",

Therefore, targeting specific cells in the liver requires an alternative strategy other than adjusting the physical size and composition of the LNPs. Ligand incorporation can be an ideal approach for selective delivery of RNA therapeutics to targeted liver cells. LSECs play an important role in scavenger system and express selective receptors such as stabilin receptors, mannose receptors, and Fc-\uf067RIIb2 (17). These receptors are involved in the removal of blood-borne antigens by active endocytosis. For example, phosphorothioate-modified antisense oligonucleotides or hyaluronic acid-conjugated nanoparticles were successfully delivered to LSECs by targeting the scavenger receptors (24,25). \n\nIn this study, we report the engineered LNP formulations for the targeted delivery of RNA into different types of cells in the liver. Hepatocytes and LSECs are two major cells involved in various liver-related diseases. Hepatocytes are often associated with rare diseases in metabolism and endocrine dysfunctions, while LSECs are closely related with chronic liver diseases such as liver fibrosis and cirrhosis (19,26,27). It is important to selectively target the liver cells in different diseases, and its selectivity becomes more critical when introducing in vivo gene regulation and editing. Here, ionizable lipids were first synthesized and screened for their pK a (where K a is the acid dissociation constant) and endolytic activities. Selected lipid candidates were further evaluated for in vitro and in vivo gene expression after formulating LNPs with reporter mRNA [firefly luciferase (FLuc)]. Targeted delivery of LNPs with mRNA (Cre) in different types of cells in the liver was examined by controlling the particle size and PEG-lipid content of LNPs. In addition, engineered LNPs with mannose moieties were prepared for active targeting of LSECs. Optimized condition for the targeted delivery of mRNA to LSECs was lastly confirmed.",

However, other cell types which are part of the hepatic reticuloendothelial system (RES), such as liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and Kupffer cells (KCs) also represent interesting targets for nucleic acid therapeutics. Although KCs are very effective in removing and destroying nanosystems, they are much more difficult to be productively transfected with commonly used nucleic acid carriers. Therefore, several attempts were made to enable nucleic acid delivery to these cell types, including receptor-targeting strategies as well as the development of novel lipids for LNPs aiming for chemical targeting (Fig. 4).",

            "text": "After establishing LNP delivery to hepatocytes, we examined the targeted delivery of mRNA-loaded LNPs to different types of liver cells by controlling their size and PEG-lipid content. Among these cells, we focused on LSECs, where many of liver-related diseases originated. First, we hypothesized that as LSECs reside in the liver blood wall, LNPs that cannot penetrate the fenestrae will be uptaken into the LSECs. We prepared various LNPs loaded with mCre, and their size was ranging from 50 to 100 nm by varying PEG-lipid (%) (Fig. 5, A and B). For a change in the mole ratio of PEG-lipid, the change must be replaced with the mole ratio of other components. Mole ratio of PEG-lipid was varied by expending that of cholesterol. We have chosen cholesterol because, first, cholesterol has the least effect on endosomal release compared to other lipids (35). Second, cholesterol accounts for a large mole ratio among the lipid compositions, so this small change only accounts for less than 10% of the original, which will have very little impact. LNPs with mCre (0.5 mg/kg) were intravenously injected into mice. Two-days after injection, the liver was extracted and tdTomato-positive cells were confirmed by histology evaluation and flow cytometry analysis. \n\nFigure 5C and fig. S9 (A to C) show that LNPs with 68 nm (1.5% PEG-lipid) exhibited potent tdTomato fluorescence in hepatocytes. Smaller LNPs with less than 100 nm in size could easily penetrate the fenestrae upon entering the liver blood vessel and showed maximum expression of tdTomato fluorescence in hepatocytes at PEG-lipid content of 1.5% with 60 nm in size. However, reduced tdTomato fluorescence throughout the liver cells was observed with LNP formulations with 3% PEG-lipid. The observed phenomenon of reduced tdTomato fluorescence in higher PEG-lipid content may be attributed to the reduced ApoE-mediated cellular uptake of LNPs (36).",

            "text": "A platform technology that delivers RNA therapeutics to targeted cells has great potential for treating various liver diseases associated with different types of cells in the liver. In particular, LSECs participate in initiation and progression of chronic liver diseases by change in their pathological characteristics in response to chemical toxins, cytokines, and inflammatory stimuli (17,19). Previous studies have shown that targeting endothelial sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor-1 and Bax in LSECs could also reduce apoptosis of LSECs and eventually reduced acute hepatic failure (43,44). The conjugation of hyaluronan, KLGR peptide, and mannose resulted in increased uptake of nano particles into LSECs compared to nonconjugated groups. Moreover, previously reported studies have confirmed that LNPs can be delivered to different tissue by changing LNP formulations. Some of these formulations showed increased mRNA delivery to LSECs without targeting ligands (45). Nevertheless, its selectivity remained not well understood (37). \n\nTo translate the targeted delivery to LSECs, ApoE-dependent cellular uptake must be replaced by alternative ligand selection and incorporation. Upon entering blood circulation system, LNPs can be readily delivered to hepatocytes and LSECs by ApoE-dependent cellular uptake. However, delivery efficacy of LNPs in LSECs is significantly less than that of hepatocytes (23). Here, we demonstrated a targeted delivery of RNA to LSECs by incorporating active ligands to LNPs. The mannose ligand can interact with specific receptors (CD206) expressed on LSECs. We have shown that incorporation of mannose to LNPs with high PEG-lipid content (3%) allowed selective delivery of mRNA/siRNA only to LSECs through mannose-CD206 interaction. It is likely that, when PEGlipid content is high enough, the ApoE-mediated cellular uptake is mostly reduced, while mannose-CD206 interaction becomes predominant for the cellular entry of LNPs. Moreover, mannoseincorporated LNPs showed bigger physical size than the diameter of the fenestrae.",

Therefore, it would be a feasible approach to target nonparenchymal cells in the liver TME for the treatment of liver metastasis. Systemic drug delivery to hepatocytes has successfully led to the approval of Onpattro by the FDA. However, the delivery to other functional nonparenchymal cells in the liver microenvironment remained challenging. Surprisingly, Paunovska et al 75 found that LNPs would be delivered more potently in stromal cells of the liver microenvironment compared to hepatocytes. These findings suggested the feasibility of targeting the liver microenvironment using drugloading liposomal nanoparticles. One of the major deficiencies of the liposomal drug was that it would be easily taken by the reticuloendothelial system, which diminished its circulating time and anti-tumor effect. However, as reticuloendothelial systems were important components of liver TME, 76 the increased uptake of TME-targeting LNPs would increase the concentrations of liposomal therapeutics in hepatic nonparenchymal cells, which led to better therapeutic effects.",

            "text": "Endothelial cell-specific Notch activation triggers maladaptation of LSEC and thereby aggravates NASH [24], where the adhesion molecule VCAM-1 is significantly upregulated in human subjects. Conversely, the inhibition of VCAM-1 [94] remarkably protects mice from the disease. Since VCAM-1 and Notch are also expressed in other tissues [95], specific targeting of LSEC to lower the expression of VCAM-1 or Notch is imperative for treating NASH with minimal detriments. Lipid nanoparticle (LNP) effectively deliver non-coding RNAs into liver and silence target pro-inflammatory genes. LNP can be conjugated with mannose that specifically binds to the membrane mannose receptors of LSEC and ionizable amine lipid scaffolds. VEGFR3 antibody conjugated LNP delivers siRNAs to the VEGFR3 \u00fe subpopulation of LSEC, which silences the pro-inflammatory RUNX1 expression and subsequently reduces the expression of VCAM-1, attenuating infiltration of immune cells and inflammation [56] (Figure 1E). Moreover, coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) plays a pathologic role in chronic liver disease, cirrhosis and inflammation [96]. In one study, the ionizable amine lipid scaffold is loaded with siRNA against FVIII gene in LSEC. The in vivo administration effectively silences FVIII in LSEC and attenuates inflammation in NASH [97] (Figure 1D). Repurposing current drugs may also contribute to LSEC-targeting strategies to treat NASH. Ablation of group IVA phospholipase A2 (IVA-PLA2) in endothelial cell/LSEC markedly suppresses activation of HSC and deposition of collagen in liver [98]. Notably, Phase 0 clinical trial to treat plaque psoriasis with inhibitors AVX001 has validated efficacy and safety in human subjects [99].",

            "text": "Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells are non-parenchymal cells, which form the sinusoidal wall and represent the interface between the blood and Kuffer cells on the one side and hepatocytes and HSCs on the other. In a healthy liver, LSECs are fully differentiated with high permeability. They are the most permeable endothelial cells in the mammalian body due to their association with fenestrae, absence of the diaphragm, and lack of the basement membrane. In human and rat fibrotic livers, LSECs lose their fenestrate and undergo capillarization. The capillarization of LSECs arises early in the course of NAFLD, probably as a result of LSEC exposure to dietary macronutrients. LSEC capillarization, in turn, encourages steatosis [15]. By keeping HSCs inactive through NO, healthy LSECs act as barriers against liver fibrosis, whereas changed LSECs (after capillarization and LSEC dysfunction) lose this capacity. Additionally, altered LSECs emit profibrogenic chemicals that stimulate HSCs, including TGF-b, Hedgehog molecules, laminin, and fibronectin [16]. Targeting LSECs to maintain the differentiation of LSECs is an interesting strategy in liver fibrosis therapy. Quantum dots (QDs) are used for imaging and transport of therapeutics [17]. A rapid absorption targets delivery of QDs with bound materials to the LSECs; 60% of an oral dose of QDs is rapidly distributed to the liver within 30 min, and this increases to 85% with FSA biopolymer coating. QDs coated with a biopolymer layer of FSA improve the bioavailability and delivery of metformin to LSECs.",

The liver has received the most attention so far, and several lipid formulations are in different clinical trial stages. 16) Recently, more attention has been given to LNPs-targeted delivery to the spleen as a promising tool for modulating the immune system for the treatment of various immune-related diseases, especially cancer immunotherapy. 20) An interesting alternate approach is to develop LNPs targeting the endothelial cells lining the blood vessels. This approach is particularly important for drug delivery to organs with a continuous endothelium (i.e., without fenestrations) since LNPs in the circulation are in direct contact with endothelial cells and this avoids the extravasation step required to transfer NPs out of blood vessels. \n\nIn this review, we discuss the recent advances in the use of LNPs for cell-specific in vivo targeted delivery of different nucleic acids. First, we describe the various types of LNPs available to date and follow the revolution of lipid materials used from conventional cationic lipids to more efficient ionizable lipids. Second, we discuss the targeted delivery of LNPs to specific cells after systemic administration. We focus mainly on liver hepatocytes and spleen immune cells, as these two organs are the most promising for gene therapy due to their physiological characteristics that facilitate the delivery of nucleic acids to different parenchymal cells. We also discuss endothelial cells as an alternate approach for targeting organs with a continuous endothelium.",

            "text": "LNPs are the most researched liver-specific targeting nanosystems loaded with mRNA. The main liver-specific targeting mechanisms are passive and endogenous targeting, owing to the structure and function of the liver. Research indicates that LNPs with a pKa value of six -seven are best-suited for mRNA delivery to the liver [114]. Among them, ionizable cationic lipids containing amino groups, such as DLin-MC3-DMA (MC3) [46], 5A2-SC8 [103], 306O i10 [104], and cationic lipid-modified aminoglycosides (CLAs) [105] exhibit high liver-targeting efficacy. The distribution of the LNPs with amino groups in liver can be as high as 81%, with the mRNA expression over 90% [104]. Nevertheless, the targeted precision delivery of mRNA should be carefully evaluated at the cellular level, as the degree of mRNA expression varies among different liver cell types in the above-mentioned research. \n\nHepatocytes account for about 80% of liver tissue and are implicated in many hereditary diseases, making them the primary targets for mRNA delivery. To enter the Disse space and directly contact hepatocytes, mRNA-LNPs for hepatocyte-targeted delivery are generally smaller than the fenestration of hepatic vascular endothelium, which measures approximately 150 nm. Hashiba et al. [115] synthesized a series of mRNA-LNPs with varying particle sizes and demonstrated that LNPs with sizes ranging from 60 to 100 nm can pass through the sinusoidal endothelial fenestrae of the liver, enhancing the hepatocyte targeting efficiency of mRNAs. Siegwart et al. [106,116,117] proposed a selector organ targeting (SORT) strategy (Fig. 7A). They synthesized 5A2-SC8-mRNA-LNPs with a particle size of approximately 122 nm. Incorporation of 20% ionizable cationic lipid 1,2-dioleoyl-3-dimethylammonium-propane (DODAP) into LNPs improved the uptake efficiency of hepatocytes to as high as 93% [106].",

Three different lipases have been described including the lipoprotein and endothelial lipase in LSECs and the hepatic lipase in hepatocytes [161]. LNP-siRNA systems that incorporate ionizable cationic lipids that are sensitive to endothelial lipase (e.g. ester linkages between head and tail functions) have enhanced gene silencing in hepatocytes but exhibit significantly reduced activity in LSECs [159]. Co-treatment with lipase inhibitors or incorporating lipase-resistant ionizable cationic lipids can recover gene silencing in LSECs [159].\n\nBased on microanatomical, subcellular, and (patho)physiological considerations, an ideal LNP for gene regulation in hepatocytes must satisfy the following design criteria: nanoparticle size < 80 nm to efficiently pass through liver fenestrae and improve LNP stability, apparent ionizable cationic lipid pKa value around 6.4, near neutral surface charge to prevent sequestration by the MPS, and lack of immune stimulation and toxic effects. Achieving these and other criteria facilitating efficient nucleic acid entrapment and LNP formulation are detailed in the following section.\n\nIt is important to mention that upon intravenous administration LNPs adsorb serum proteins on their surface. Many, if not all, of the abovementioned physiochemical characteristics impart distinct properties to the LNPs which ultimately influence protein adsorption. This \"biomolecular corona\" covering nanoparticles significantly impacts systemic circulation and nano-bio interactions [162][163][164]. Efficient targeting and gene regulation in hepatocytes stems from the presence of ApoE in the corona of LNPs and enabled the success of Onpattro\u00ae [33,76].

            "text": "The last few years have witnessed a great advance in the development of nonviral systems for in vivo targeted delivery of nucleic acids. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are the most promising carriers for producing clinically approved products in the future. Compared with other systems used for nonviral gene delivery, LNPs provide several advantages including higher stability, low toxicity, and greater efficiency. Additionally, systems based on LNPs can be modified with ligands and devices for controlled biodistribution and internalization into specific cells. Efforts are ongoing to improve the efficiency of lipid-based gene vectors. These efforts depend on the appropriate design of nanocarriers as well as the development of new lipids with improved gene delivery ability. Several ionizable lipids have recently been developed and have shown dramatically improved efficiency. However, enhancing the ability of nanocarriers to target specific cells in the body remains the most difficult challenge. Systemically administered LNPs can access organs in which the capillaries are characterized by the presence of fenestrations, such as the liver and spleen. The liver has received the most attention to date, although targeted delivery to the spleen has recently emerged as a promising tool for modulating the immune system. In this review, we discuss recent advances in the use of LNPs for cell-specific targeted delivery of nucleic acids. We focus mainly on targeting liver hepatocytes and spleen immune cells as excellent targets for gene therapy. We also discuss the potential of endothelial cells as an alternate approach for targeting organs with a continuous endothelium.",

            "text": "Upon entering the blood stream, nanoparticles rapidly absorb serum proteins on their surface. The effects of protein corona heavily control the biodistribution of nanoparticles. For some LNPs, ApoE adsorption is essential for the cellular uptake of LNPs. Akinc et al. (15) have described the role of ApoE in the in vivo uptake of LNPs by hepatocytes. They compared the uptake of LNPs by hepatocytes in wild-type and ApoE knockout mice. The activity of LNPs was remarkably reduced in ApoE knockout (ApoE \u2212/\u2212 ) mice compared to wild-type mice. Since the major cell population in the liver is hepatocytes and they overexpress LDLR, an alternative targeting ligand is necessary for LSEC-specific delivery of RNA other than the ApoE. Previously, specific targeting ligands were evaluated for enhancing the selective delivery of LNPs to target cells (15). Kumar et al. (36) showed decreased activity of LNPs with higher PEG-lipid content in hepatocytes due to reduced association of ApoE with LNPs. They showed that LNPs with 5% PEG-lipid have a lower binding affinity with ApoE compared to LNPs with 1.5% PEG-lipid. By introducing unique targeting ligands to the highly PEGylated LNPs, ApoE-mediated cellular uptake can be blocked and selective delivery of LNPs can be achieved. \n\nAmong various liver cells, LSECs are substantial targets for RNA therapeutics because LSECs are closely related to fetal liver diseases resulting from LSECs-derived gene products (17,19). To achieve the selective delivery of LNPs to LSECs, we introduced LSEC-specific ligands to highly PEGylated LNPs. Mannose receptor is one of the receptors that specifically expressed on human and mice LSECs (17). Mannose-conjugated nanoparticles have been investigated in various targeted delivery studies, and these nanoparticles have been proven to be safe (37,38).",

[5,10,[12][13][14][15] However, expanding the scope of LNP-based gene therapies to other hepatic cell types (or nonhepatic cells), and therefore gain access to many tissue-/cell-specific diseases, has so far proven more challenging. To meet this challenge, empirical screening of LNPs has revealed formulations that preferentially target extrahepatic tissues (e.g., bone marrow) [16,17] and cells (e.g., T-cells), [18,19] as well as individual hepatic (e.g., liver endothelial) cell types. [20,21] However, while these empirical discoveries have enriched our understanding of the structure-activity land-scape of LNP technologies, they have not revealed the biological mechanisms underpinning LNP transport and preferential cellular uptake in vivo. This knowledge is fundamental for rational design and should be the foundation of any future discovery efforts toward LNP-RNA therapies with target cell specificity beyond hepatocytes. [5,22] Besides hepatocytes (comprising \u224880% liver volume), the liver is composed of nonparenchymal liver cells, including Kupffer cells (KCs) and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). [23] Hepatic blood vessels, or sinusoids, connecting the hepatic artery and portal vein to the central vein, are primarily composed of LSECs (\u224870%) and KCs (\u224820%). [24,25] Together, these two cell types make up the hepatic reticuloendothelial system (RES) whose primary role is to maintain blood homeostasis through the scavenging of macromolecular waste and pathogens from blood. [26,27] LSECs, in particular, are specialized scavenger endothelial cells (SECs) and have one of the highest endocytic activities of any cell type in the body.

Specifically, the hepatic sinusoids contain a discontinuous vasculature 12 as well as slow blood flow 13 ; both increase nanoparticle extravasation and subsequent interactions with hepatocytes. To target non-hepatocytes, scientists have used three approaches 14 . The first is to pre-treat animals with systems that overwhelm the liver 15 or reduce drug activity 16 in specific cell types, thereby shifting tropism. However, it remains unclear whether this multistep strategy has clinical relevance. In the second approach, an LNP with tropism to hepatocytes is retargeted with an active targeting ligand. For example, LNPs made with DLin-MC3-DMA 17 , an ionizable lipid that is FDA approved for hepatocyte siRNA delivery 18 , have been retargeted to immune cells using a lipidbound antibody [19][20][21][22] . One potential limitation of this approach is that actively targeted nanoparticles containing RNA drugs have led to adverse events in clinical trials 23 ; one important caveat is that these were not LNPs. In a third approach, scientists identify nanoparticles that interact with natural trafficking pathways, thereby leading to endogenous targeting 24 . Although these approaches have led to an FDA approval 18 and promising phase 1 clinical data 25 , this approach also has a key limitation. After synthesizing a large, chemically diverse lipid library, scientists must evaluate how each nanoparticle delivers its payload into cells. Since injecting and sacrificing thousands of mice per library is unethical, this screening is performed in vitro (i.e., in cell culture). For example, across three representative papers [26][27][28] , labs tested 4,736 nanoparticles in vitro, using the data to select 14 nanoparticles for in vivo studies. However, this screening method is likely inefficient, given that in vitro nanoparticle delivery can be a poor predictor of in vivo nanoparticle delivery 29 .",

Although YSK05-LNP and YSK05/12-LNP have a similar biodistribution, as shown in Figure S2, in which the lipids and siRNA of both types of LNPs were visualized by Fluo-rVivo imaging and were found to be largely distributed to liver tissues, the intrahepatic distribution of those LNPs varied and was determined by their pKa value. The intrahepatic distribution was shifted substantially from hepatocytes (with YSK05-LNP [pKa 6.50; Figure 6, upper]) into LSECs (with YSK05/12-LNP [pKa 7.15; Figure 6, lower]). However, we observed that traces of the YSK05/12-LNP were distributed into hepatocytes and liver resident macrophages (Kupffer cells). Furthermore, the biodistribution of YSK05/12-LNP to the lung and spleen was minimal (only a weak siRNA fluorescent intensity was detected in lungs [Figure S2]) and its silencing activity in lung and spleen endothelia was weak (Figure S1). The selectivity of the YSK05/12-LNP for the liver endothelium over the lung or spleen endothelium can be attributed to the special scavenging character of LSECs, which have a very high endocytic capacity and are responsible for the uptake of soluble or colloidal materials and nanoparticles that are not large enough to be phagocytosed by Kupffer cells. 16,17,20,46,47",

For example, circUGP2 LNPs inhibited tumor progression via p53 activation while partially targeting Kupffer cells. 33 Cre mRNA-loaded COATSOMESS-OP also achieved precise gene editing in hepatocytes (Cre mRNA encodes the Cre recombinase enzyme). 73 Biodegradable LNPs delivered ARG1 mRNA for metabolic restoration in arginase deficiency models, 74 and CL4H6 siRNA-loaded LNPs efficiently silenced hepatocyte genes with high specificity. 75 (6) Target cell specificity is a requirement for successful delivery. \n\nKupffer cells often sequester LNPs, reducing delivery to hepatocytes. However, depletion strategies have been shown to improve hepatocyte targeting by minimizing LNP clearance by Kupffer cells. 35 For example, depletion of Kupffer cells was shown to improve nanoparticle delivery to tumors by up to 150-fold, though the maximum tumor accumulation remains only 2% of the injected dose, demonstrating systemic challenges in nanoparticle targeting. LSECs, because of their fenestrations, facilitated selective delivery, such as for receptor-specific LNPs. 23 7][78] Similarly, targeted therapies using hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/epidermal growth factor (EGF) mRNA and NM-FGF19 mRNA-loaded LNPs successfully treated chronic liver injuries and metabolic dysfunction by delivering therapeutic payloads to specific hepatic cells. 79,80 ecent studies demonstrated new mechanisms for liver-targeted delivery. For example, anionic LNPs targeted Kupffer cells and LSECs through stabilin receptors, 45 while GalNAc-LNPs entered hepatocytes through asialoglycoprotein (ASGP) receptor-mediated uptake, independent of LDL receptor. 81 (7) Some LNP formulations demonstrated extrahepatic targeting beyond the liver.",

After intravenous injection of a liver cell-targeted delivery system (nanoparticles) containing a therapeutic molecule, the nanoparticle binds to plasma proteins, particularly albumin. Plasma protein binding reduces liver-specific uptake of the nanoparticle delivery system. Nanoparticles can be delivered to hepatocytes through receptormediated endocytosis, into Kupffer cells by phagocytosis and receptor-mediated endocytosis, into stellate cells by receptormediated endocytosis and into LSECs by pinocytosis and receptor-mediated endocytosis. Of these endocytic routes, receptormediated endocytosis is the most commonly used method to deliver nanoparticles into the targeted liver cells. Most of the nanoparticles are taken up and removed by Kupffer cells and LSECs because they express a variety of receptors that limit the number of nanoparticles capable of reaching the hepatocytes and stellate cells. \n\nefficiency in vitro, their transfection efficiency is much lower in vivo because of the high endocytic capacity of Kupffer and LSECs. \n\nTo facilitate the selective transfer of therapeutic molecules into hepatocytes, the delivery system should have a small diameter to allow the delivery system to pass through the sinusoidal endothelial fenestrae (Rensen et al., 2001), which are 100 nm in diameter (Wisse et al., 1985). After passing through the fenestrae, the delivery systems can be internalized in hepatocytes. \n\nAsialoglycoprotein receptor-mediated delivery.

During screening, researchers discovered PPZ-A10, a lipid with shorter C10 carbon chains. They incorporated PPZ-A10, along with cholesterol, C18PEG2K, and DOPE, to create LNPs for efficient mRNA delivery to Kupffer cells. 160 Furthermore, a range of vector optimized strategies have been developed with the specific aim of improving the targeted delivery to liver parenchymal cells. A delivery vector designed by Finn et al. 161 achieved significant hepatic editing, with around 70% effectiveness at the mouse thyroxine transfer protein gene locus. This editing reached most hepatocytes in the mouse liver, including GS+ pericentral cells. 161 In another example, the reducible LNPs composed of disulfide bondcontaining hydrophobic tails have been screened for delivering Cas9 mRNA and single guide RNA (sgRNA) to hepatocytes to promote proprotein convertase subtilisin/Kexin type 9 (PCSK9) knockdown. 162,163 There was a design of LNPs targeting the hepatic reticuloendothelial system (RES) that enhanced mRNA expression in the liver, especially in RES cell types. 164 Such targeting approaches hold potential for ameliorating liver-related disorders by modulating specific cellular responses, thereby minimizing off-target effects and fostering therapeutic efficacy. \n\nUsing ligands to actively target delivery vectors to the liver and other organs of interest is a potential research area.",

For example, Perche et al. showed that mannosylated lipopolyplex can target splenic dendritic cells more efficiently than control lipopolyplex [159]. Similarly, Kim et al. found that LNPs with ionizable lipids 241C10 to 246C10 can efficiently target liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) [108]. Moreover, Liu et al. observed that ionizable lipids with different lengths of hydrocarbon tails or helper lipids with different charges can be used to guide organ-selective mRNA-LNP distributions [130]. Chen et al. also applied the lipid 113-O12B to formulate LNPs that can specifically target lymph nodes [36]. Researchers also observed that tuning the content of PEG lipids in LNPs causes mRNA-loaded LNPs to target different types of liver cells in vivo. The same study offered evidence that mRNA-LNPs with mannose-PEG lipid specifically target liver sinusoidal endothelial cells [108]. Additionally, it has been reported that encapsulating additional molecules in LNPs can direct the complexes to different tissues. For example, inclusion of DODAP, 18PA or DOTAP causes the LNPs to respectively target liver, spleen or lung [38,50]. Moreover, Veiga et al. intravenously injected leukocyte-targeted IL-10 mRNA encapsulated in an anti-Ly6c-antibody-decorated LNP into a mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This treatment increased the expression of IL-10 in colon, consequently reducing intestinal inflammation and preventing colitis pathogenesis [233]. Using a similar LNP design, Rosenblum et al. intraperitoneally injected anti-EGFR-antibody-decorated LNPs encapsulating Cas9 mRNA and PLK1 single guide RNA (sgRNA) to disseminated ovarian-tumor-bearing mice.",

            "text": "ECs are highly specified endothelial cells that line the liver sinusoids. Unlike other endothelial cells, LSECs are fenestrated, which allows them to facilitate the transfer of molecules, including LNPs, into the space of Disse, where hepatocytes reside. These fenestrae, small pores around 100-140 nm in diameter, make LSECs highly permeable to small nanoparticles. 34 Once in proximity to hepatocytes, LNPs that successfully bind to ApoE can be taken up via LDL receptors, promoting functional delivery. ApoE is essential for LNPs to target the liver. \n\nIn the bloodstream, ApoE binds to LNPs, forming a protein corona that allows them to be recognized by LDL receptors on hepatocytes. 22,43 The lipid composition of LNPs (e.g., ionizable and helper lipids) also influences ApoE binding efficiency. 22,44 In addition, the efficiency of ApoE-coated LNP uptake is influenced by hepatocyte zonation, as metabolic and cellular differences across liver zones determine the fate and distribution of LNPs. 16 wever, LNPs that fail to bind ApoE or that become coated with other serum proteins may be redirected to non-target cells or cleared by the spleen. 24,36 LSECs also express a variety of receptors, including scavenger receptors (e.g., stabilin-1 and stabilin-2) 45 and mannose receptors, 23 that can mediate the active uptake of functionalized LNPs. For MacParland et al. 34 example, mannose-modified LNPs can selectively bind LSECs, improving RNA therapeutic delivery. 23 In addition, the slow blood flow in liver sinusoids allows more time for LNPs to interact with LSECs. 15 Finally, altering the size, charge, and surface chemistry of LNPs can optimize their interaction with LSECs, with smaller particles (<100 nm) more readily translocated through the fenestrae and internalized. 23",

Kupffer cells, the liver's resident macrophage population, are known to phagocytose foreign particulates. Most of the nanoparticles are typically taken up by Kupffer cells in the liver, which preferentially interact with negatively charged NPs. Kupffer cells are responsible for immune and inflammatory responses and regulate liver diseases, including NAFLD. Hepatocytes, which are specialized epithelial cells, also interact with NPs but to a lower extent than the macrophages. ey activate other liver cells and are also involved in immune and inflammatory responses. In contrary to Kupffer cells, hepatocyte uptake of NPs increases with positive zeta potential. Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) are specialized endothelial cells that form the interface between blood cells and liver cells. Open fenestrations and lack of basal lamina of LSECs provide a mesh-like structure leading to the entrapment of NPs in the liver. Stellate cells are fat-storing cells that play a crucial role in liver fibrosis [17,19]. is preferential distribution to the liver is attributed to the presence of fenestrations along the endothelial barrier of the liver and the absence of basal lamina.

            "text": "It is well-known that statins have beneficial effects on dysfunctional sinusoidal cells by selectively NO bioavailability and inhibiting RhoA/Rho-kinase in the liver. This was confirmed in portal hypertension of rats with NASH (88). In addition, simvastatin administration for 15 days in aged cirrhotic rats improves the hepatic sinusoidal milieu, demonstrating its therapeutic potential in advanced chronic liver disease (93). Simvastatin restores the quiescence of aHSCs via stimulation of KLF2-NO signaling in LSECs (97). Treatment with the pan-peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (pan-PPAR) agonist lanifibranor demonstrates phenotypic improvement in a rat model of cBDL as well as in human hepatocytes from patients with cirrhosis (98). Although further validation is needed in human trials, it paves a way to develop novel drugs that target both HSCs and LSECs to treat liver fibrosis. \n\nThe property of containing numerous receptors to endocytose soluble macromolecules and small particles (20) makes LSECs suitable for specific drug delivery. To date, several modified polymers targeting LSECs have been developed to delivery drugs. Hide et al (99) designed simvastatin-loaded polymeric micelles to treat chronic liver disease and showed promising results, thus suggesting that nanoparticles are a promising therapeutic approach. On the other hand, liver sinusoidal capillarization and ECM deposition are dual pathological barriers to drug delivery (20), Zhang et al (100) constructed an efficient nanodrug delivery system with LSEC-targeting and fenestrae-repairing nanoparticles (named HA-NPs/SMV) on the basis of the modification with hyaluronic acid.",

Since endothelial cells express unique surface molecules such as sugars and proteins, lipid nanoparticles have been coated with molecules that target endothelial surface molecules. For example, Kusumoto et al. developed a lipid nanoparticle coated with GALA peptides on their surface to selectively target pulmonary endothelial cells [123]. The GALA peptides were capable of directing the nanoparticles to endothelial cells by targeting the sialic acid-terminated sugar chains on the pulmonary endothelium, which subsequently delivered the encapsulated nucleic acids to the endothelial cytosol via endosomal membrane fusion [123].\n\nSimilarly, Kim et al. reported that the addition of mannose to lipid nanoparticles enabled selective RNA delivery to liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, as mannose receptors are preferentially expressed in the liver endothelium and therefore nanoparticles containing mannose on their surface would be scavenged by liver endothelial cells [93]. In the same form, Parhiz et al. and Marquez et al. demonstrated that the addition of PECAM-1 antibody or chondroitin sulfate allowed the selective delivery of LNPs to endothelial cells by targeting proteins ubiquitously expressed on the endothelium [96,157].\n\nOther reports have demonstrated that the addition of antibodies or binding peptides that target adhesion proteins on an activated endothelium directs LNPs to endothelial cells from different organs. One example of such work was produced by Kowalski et al. who showed that addition of anti-VCAM-1 antibodies to the surface of SAINT-O-Some lipid nanoparticles facilitated the delivery of siRNA to inflamed renal endothelial cells [129]. In the brain, nanocarriers functionalized with antibodies that recognize VCAM-1 successfully delivered thrombomodulin (TM)-encoding mRNA and mitigated TNF\u03b1-induced cerebral edema in a rat model [192].

For example, a platform for mRNA delivery to activated hepatic stellate cells (aHSCs) was reported, from which a promising lipid candidate CL15A6 with high affinity to aHSCs was identified, and the biosafety with an in vivo dose up to 2 mg/kg was proven. 37 In addition, Frederick Campbell and colleagues rationally designed an anionic LNP that switched neutral LNPs surface charge into anionic based on the formulation of Onpattro, 38 which preferentially targeted mRNA delivery to the hepatic reticuloendothelial system (RES) made up of LSECs and KCs through scavenger receptors stabilin-1 and -2 mediating anionic recognition of LNPs with LSECs. 39 elective targeting of liver cells by using ligand-modified LNPs is another potential strategy. Mannose-modified LNPs can achieve selective delivery of nucleic acids to LSECs through the mannose receptor, which is specifically expressed on LSECs. 30,40 This strategy was employed by Andre E. Nel and his team, where they used mannose-modified DSPE-PEG 2000 as the PEGylated lipid moiety of LNPs (Figure 1A), enabling LSEC-specific delivery of GFP mRNA at the cellular level (Figure 1B), and also enhancing in vivo lung gathering of man-LNPs with the dose of 1 mg/kg (Figure 1C). 41 onventional LNPs mostly enrich the liver due to natural characteristics, making it difficult and necessary to target extra-hepatic tissue. Inspired by the four-component formula of classical LNPs, the selective organ-targeting (SORT) strategy, first reported by Daniel J. Siegwart's group, has been reported, which involves the incorporation of a complementary component, known as the SORT molecule, in classical fourcomposition LNPs (Figure 1D). 42",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are the leading nonviral technologies for the delivery of exogenous RNA to target cells in vivo. As systemic delivery platforms, these technologies are exemplified by Onpattro, an approved LNP\u2010based RNA interference therapy, administered intravenously and targeted to parenchymal liver cells. The discovery of systemically administered LNP technologies capable of preferential RNA delivery beyond hepatocytes has, however, proven more challenging. Here, preceded by comprehensive mechanistic understanding of in vivo nanoparticle biodistribution and bodily clearance, an LNP\u2010based messenger RNA (mRNA) delivery platform is rationally designed to preferentially target the hepatic reticuloendothelial system (RES). Evaluated in embryonic zebrafish, validated in mice, and directly compared to LNP\u2013mRNA systems based on the lipid composition of Onpattro, RES\u2010targeted LNPs significantly enhance mRNA expression both globally within the liver and specifically within hepatic RES cell types. Hepatic RES targeting requires just a single lipid change within the formulation of Onpattro to switch LNP surface charge from neutral to anionic. This technology not only provides new opportunities to treat liver\u2010specific and systemic diseases in which RES cell types play a key role but, more importantly, exemplifies that rational design of advanced RNA therapies must be preceded by a robust understanding of the dominant nano\u2013biointeractions involved.",

            "text": "The liver constitutes a vital organ that assumes a pivotal role in various physiological processes encompassing metabolism, detoxification, and immune modulation. However, liver diseases such as hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer are prevalent and can be life-threatening. LNPs have been shown to selectively accumulate in the liver due to their uptake and clearance by liver macrophages, the largest population of phagocytes in the body. Moreover, the interplay between LNPs and plasma proteins substantially influences their systemic clearance dynamics post-administration. Therefore, liver-targeted delivery using LNPs represents a promising avenue for the treatment of liver-related diseases, as it can minimize the occurrence of side effects and improve the efficacy of therapeutic agents. \n\nIn the past few years, LNPs always selectively accumulate in the liver, which correlates with nanoparticle uptake and clearance by liver macrophages, the largest population of phagocytes in the body. 152 In addition, the interaction of LNPs with plasma proteins plays an important role in the clearance process of LNPs after entering the body. 153 ost of the studies on carriers selectively delivered to the liver are conducted from ApoE, which promotes receptormediated cellular entry. 99 A recent study indicated that the binding of ApoE can induce the rearrangement of the shell and core lipids of LNPs containing mRNA. 154 According to Zheng et al., 155 the ability to attain liver targeting can be accomplished by systematically refining the nanoparticle vector formulation using the central composite design approach. \n\nThe human liver is primarily composed of parenchymal cells and nonparenchymal cells. Focusing on these specific cell types provides a precise approach to treating disease. Liver parenchymal cells are commonly implicated in hepatitis especially the HBV and other related diseases, whereas nonparenchymal cells, such as liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and hepatic stellate cells, 156 are closely associated with chronic liver conditions like liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. 157,158",

LNPs accumulated broadly across these cell types, though functional mRNA delivery was notably higher in liver endothelial cells than in Kupffer cells or hepatocytes. Liver endothelial cells, with their distinctive discontinuous vasculature, act as a gateway, allowing LNPs to extravasate into the space of Disse, where they can interact with hepatocytes and other liver cells. Notably, endothelial cell subtypes, for example, CD32High (central venous zone) and CD32Low (periportal zone), showed different interactions with LNPs, with CD32Low cells exhibiting higher accumulation. This spatial distribution and receptor expression in liver endothelial cells influenced LNP uptake and processing, which in turn impacted biodistribution and functional delivery (Figure 3). 0][51] As part of the fibrotic matrix in liver disease, they may also influence how LNPs interact with the immune system. 34",

            "text": "Depletion of Kupffer cells to minimize liver sequestration and enhance nanoparticle circulation to target tissues. For example, clodronate liposomes are used to selectively target macrophages, resulting in their depletion. [40] Hepatocytes are the main parenchymal cells of the liver, responsible for liver-specific metabolic functions, including the synthesis of proteins (e.g., albumin), detoxification, and lipid metabolism. Because of interactions with LDL receptors, these cells are highly permeable to LNPs, especially those smaller than 100 nm in diameter. ApoE-coated LNPs bind to LDL receptors and allow LNP uptake into hepatocytes. 23 The heterogeneity of hepatocytes is also remarkable; they exhibit zonation across the liver acinus, with different metabolic roles depending on their location. 34 Hepatocyte zonation influences LNP behavior. Zone 1 (periportal) hepatocytes perform oxidative metabolism, while Zone 3 (pericentral) hepatocytes specialize in detoxification and lipid metabolism. Zone 3 hepatocytes enhance ApoE-mediated LNP uptake through higher LDL receptor expression. 23 Smaller LNPs (<100 nm) use the fenestrations in LSECs to target Zone 3, while the proximity of Zone 1 to blood flow facilitates rapid uptake. 30,31 Therapeutic designs should consider the specific functions of hepatocyte zonation: for example, targeting Zone 3 for detoxification therapies due to its role in lipid and xenobiotic detoxification, and Zone 1 for metabolic disorders because of its focus on oxidative metabolism. 41 Moreover, variations in ploidy among hepatocytes are vital in their spatial and functional specialization. This adds another dimension to the complexity of liver zonation, shaping critical metabolic processes, for example, lipid metabolism and the clearance of nanoparticles. 34,42 ECs are highly specified endothelial cells that line the liver sinusoids.",

Because LSECs highly express the mannose receptor, which recognizes and binds endogenous glycoproteins and infectious microorganisms, functionalizing nanoparticles with mannose Review article moieties promotes targeting of LSECs. In one example, conjugating mannose to the end of the PEG lipid component of an LNP shifted mRNA delivery from hepatocytes to LSECs for Cre recombinase gene editing 165 . Further cell specificity was achieved by increasing the PEG density on the LNP surface to reduce ApoE binding and subsequent hepatocyte targeting.\n\nManipulating the molecular composition of nanoparticles also leads to LSEC delivery. For example, altering the pK a of LNPs away from 6.4, which is optimal for hepatocyte delivery, to approximately 7.1 corresponded to a shift in the intrahepatic biodistribution and gene-silencing efficacy of LNPs from hepatocytes to LSECs.

In addition, we compared a ligand-dependent mRNA delivery efficiency of LNPs using mannose-PEG lipid with that of galactose-PEG lipid. As shown in fig. S8, LNPs with mannose-PEG lipid and galactose-PEG lipid resulted in slightly bigger size than LNPs with PEG-lipid only. This phenomenon was previously reported among saccharideconjugated nanoparticles (41,42). The prepared mFLuc-loaded LNPs were injected intravenously into C57BL/6 mice at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg. Whole-body image showed substantial bioluminescence in the mice liver with mannose-incorporated LNPs and supported the liver tissue-specific expression of mFLuc. \n\nWe then examined the ability of LSEC-specific gene editing using mCre. mCre-loaded LNPs with mannose were injected to mice at a dose of mRNA at 0.5 mg/kg. As shown in Fig. 7A, ex vivo organ images also confirmed robust liver-specific tdTomato fluorescence. Next, cell type-specific fluorescence was quantified by imaging tissue sections. Notable tdTomato fluorescence was detected along the liver vessel (LSECs), and Kupffer cells rarely expressed tdTomato fluorescence (Fig. 7B). We further quantified this phenomenon by counting tdTomato fluorescence-positive cells with MetaMorph image software. As shown in Fig. 7C, 15% of hepatocytes, 70% of LSECs, and 15% of Kupffer cells were tdTomato fluorescence positive. tdTomato fluorescence-positive cells were also confirmed by flow cytometry analysis (fig. S9D). Notably, compared with LNPs with 3.0% PEG-lipid, mannose-incorporated LNPs showed the substantial decrease of tdTomato fluorescence in hepatocytes.",

Alternatively, researchers have sought to leverage the physiological role of the liver in secretion of molecules into the systemic circulation, treating hepatocytes as an endogenous bioreactor for producing therapeutic biomolecules.\n\nLNPs are the most advanced delivery system for targeting hepatocytes. Most notably, the first siRNA drug approved by the FDA, Onpattro, utilizes a four-component LNP carrier composed of an ionizable amino lipid (DLin-MC3-DMA), 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, cholesterol and 1,2-dimyristoyl-rac-glycero-3-methoxypolyethylene glycol-2000, to treat hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis 73 . The successful clinical translation of Onpattro and of the two LNP-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines 2,3 has established that LNPs are a safe, efficacious and scalable technology platform, laying a firm foundation that can ease the translation of other LNP-based therapeutics. Because of the extensive experience and varied applications of LNPs as delivery systems to liver hepatocytes, the remainder of this section focuses on LNPs.\n\nLNPs are now being utilized as delivery systems in a diverse array of preclinical and clinical studies of nucleic acid therapeutics to hepatocytes. Many of these studies focus on mRNA delivery in several clinical contexts including protein replacement therapy, such as in clotting disorders [147][148][149] or in-born errors of metabolism 35,[150][151][152][153][154][155][156] , in situ gene editing 49,157 and systemic secretion of monoclonal antibodies against infectious diseases or cancer 69,",

In particular, mannose receptors (CD206) have been attracting attention because they are expressed on immunocompetent cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells, as well as on vascular endothelial cells [90]. Applying this strategy, an attempt to modify the cell selectivity in the liver by mannose modification was also reported in LNPs [49]. The pharmacokinetics of general LNPs is determined by the formation of protein corona especially after systemic administration, as described above. To make active targeting dominant, it is necessary to inhibit the formation of protein corona. It has been reported that increasing the amount of PEG-lipids reduced the interaction with ApoE and the LDLR-mediated delivery to hepatocytes. Therefore, in the LNPs based on ionizable lipids, DOPE, cholesterol, and PEG-lipid, the amount of PEG-lipid was increased to 3%, which is higher than general LNPs, and 2.5% of it was replaced with mannose-modified PEG-lipid. In the evaluation of firefly luciferase mRNA as a reporter, the mannose modification of LNPs did not change the liver-specific protein expression. The cellular pattern of protein expression in the liver, however, changed significantly in an evaluation using LSL-tdTomato mice. In the original LNPs, the percentage of tdTomato-positive cells was~70% for hepatocytes,~10% for liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), and~5% for Kupffer cells; in the mannose-modified LNPs, the percentage was~15% for hepatocytes,~70% for LSECs, and~15% for Kupffer cells.

            "text": "With a blood flow of about 2 l/min and a sinusoidal blood lining surface area the size of a tennis court, the liver is one of the most vascularized tissues in the body. It is responsible for the clearance of large molecules and nanoparticles from blood, a function which is often counterproductive to the successful delivery of therapeutic compounds to other tissues or even specific cells within the liver. Several studies show that oligonucleotides (unmodified or conjugated) will end up in the liver to a far higher extent than the intended target tissue, although the rates vary between studies. In one study intravenous administration of an AON resulted in 40% and 18% accumulation in the liver and kidneys respectively (Bijsterbosch et al, 1997), whilst intravenous administration of CpG oligonucleotides resulted in 50% and 40% accumulation in the liver and kidneys respectively (Martin-Armas et al, 2006). The main cellular site of liver uptake are the extremely active scavenger liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) (Sorensen et al, 2015) followed by hepatocytes and Kupffer cells (KCs; (Bijsterbosch et al, 1997), however the degree of uptake in hepatocytes can vary from 40% in the first study to no apparent uptake in the CpG study. Similarly, a histological study revealed that phosphorothioate oligonucleotides accumulated mainly in KCs and LSECs (Butler et al, 1997). KCs specialize in phagocytic clearance of blood-borne particles larger than 200 nm while LSECs mediate the clearance of smaller particles such as oligonucleotides, peptides, large macromolecules and nanoparticles via rapid and powerful clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Sorensen et al, 2012). LSECs contain fenestrations with numerous open pores of 50-150 nm in diameter, enabling access into the underlying perisinusoidal space and therefore to hepatocytes. However, LSECs are also able to endocytose from the perisinusoidal space and do so at a",

As a consequence, the biodistribution shifted from hepatocytes to LSECs and KCs, respectively, using cholesterol-oleate or oxidized cholesterol [143,144]. Additionally, the distribution of commercial LNP formulations with DLin-MC3 compared to the ionizable lipid cKK-E12 was assessed, revealing that both formulations were not only delivered to hepatocytes but partly to LSECs and KCs [142]. Furthermore, variations within the alkyl chains of the phospholipids giving \"constrained\" adamantyl-phospholipids which delivered the cargo specifically to KCs and LSECs, but not to immune cells outside the liver were evaluated [145].\n\nRecently, Pattipeiluhu et al. developed LNPs for delivery of mRNA to hepatic RES resembling the Onpattro\u00ae formulation. By replacing the phospholipid within the LNP from the zwitterionic 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC) to the anionic 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (DSPG) a negative surface charge was created and specific uptake by LSECs under participation of Stabilin receptors in embryonic zebrafish and mice was achieved [146].",

            "text": "Innate immunoreactivity driven by PRR within the liver occurs in three main cell types: hepatocytes, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and Kupffer cells (KCs) (Figure 4). Within these cell types, oligonucleotide immune reactivity (TLR3/7/8/9) is most predominant in LSECs and KCs (Figure 4) [46][47][48]. PS modification of ASOs and NAPs drives their accumulation primarily in the liver and kidney [49][50][51][52] and is not affected by 2 ribose modification. Within the liver, the majority of ASO/NAP accumulation occurs in LSECs, with smaller accumulations in KC and hepatocytes (Figure 4) [53]. The PS modification is only very sparingly used in siRNA and as such, even when stabilized with a variety of 2 ribose modifications, very little accumulation occurs in the liver. First generation siRNA drugs used lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulation. LNP-siRNA complexes with apolipoprotein E (Apo E) following administration and transits LSECs and KCs silently to deliver naked siRNA with high specificity and selectivity into hepatocytes (Figure 4) [54][55][56]. Unfortunately, LNPs also have proinflammatory effects in the liver [57], ultimately resulting in their discontinuation in clinical development for more recent siRNA drugs. Modern ASO and siRNA drugs in development now employ conjugation with a triennial N-acetylglucosamine moiety (GalNAc) to achieve delivery to hepatocytes [58]. This conjugation approach significantly improves the fraction of ASOs accumulating in hepatocytes and circumvents the proinflammatory effects of LNPs. However, a significant minority (~30%) of GalNAc-conjugated ASOs and siRNAs are delivered to LSEC and KC [59,60].",

            "text": "Notably, the hepatic uptake process dynamics of LNPs differs between the ApoE-LDLR-mediated endogenous targeting pathway and the GalNAc-mediated active targeting pathway [92]. Specifically, in the endogenous targeting pathway, LNPs rapidly enter the Disse space from the blood and gradually accumulate, then being slowly absorbed by the cells. In contrast, in the active targeting pathway, LNPs exhibit slower and more sustained cellular uptake, remaining in the blood for a longer period. Although active targeting can enhance the specificity of the mRNA-LNPs by incorporating additional targeting ligands, its implementation for hepatocyte targeting is less common due to increased formulation complexity. Currently, liver-specific delivery research predominantly employs passive and endogenous targeting. \n\nBesides hepatocytes, other cells also play important roles in liver diseases and can serve as the target cells of mRNA NPs [121]. For example, HSCs are important effector cells in liver fibrosis [122], while liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) are significant in immunotherapy and a proposed target for immunomodulation [113,123]. \n\nHowever, HSCs are difficult to transfect, and the complexity of the liver microenvironment during liver fibrosis further compounds the difficulty of targeting HSCs. To address these challenges, Younis et al. designed a ligand-free mRNA-LNP containing CL15A6 lipid of hydrophobic scaffold structure (Fig. 7B) [108]. This formulation achieved successful transfection of over 80% of HSCs in vivo in liver fibrosis mice. The CL15A6-LNP had a diameter of approximately 80 nm, allowing it to pass through the fenestrated liver sinusoidal endothelium. Additionally, the LNP pKa was about 7.25, which made LNPs unrecognizable by ApoE, thus avoiding substantial interactions with hepatocytes. Further, CL15A6-LNP uptake by HSCs occurs through platelet-derived growth factor receptor \u03b2 (PDGFR\u03b2)-mediated CME.",

For example, lipid compositions can shift the protein corona abundance away from ApoE, which is a recognized driver of hepatocyte LNP uptake and transfection [191].\n\nKnowing that lipid nanoparticles can be directed to the pulmonary endothelium by introducing cationic lipids in their formulation established one of the first rational design strategies to target endothelial cells. This finding could accelerate the production of targeted nanoparticles to the endothelium, as most nanoparticles generated prior to this discovery were fabricated with lipids obtained from tedious library screens or novel chemical synthesis. Coincidentally, most lipids generated through those approaches turned out to be cationic. AtuFECT01, for example, is a cationic lipid that was derived from a novel chemical synthesis that was used to formulate nanoparticles with siRNA to knockdown genes of endothelial cells [179]. The nanoparticles made with the AtuFECT01 lipid were capable of transfecting endothelial cells in various organs, including the lung, heart, and liver [179]. These nanoparticles were later optimized to become selective to pulmonary endothelial cells by increasing the amount of AtuFECT01 lipid and introducing cholesterol in their formulation [122].\n\nAnother cationic lipid that was derived from a library screen and used in the formulation of siRNA containing nanoparticles to target endothelial cells is 7C1 [121,175]. This lipid, which was obtained from the conjugation of alkyl chains to low molecular weight polyethylenimine (PEI), formed nanoparticles that were highly selective for endothelial cells of mice and non-human primates, and was capable of transfecting the endothelium of various organs, including the lung where they had the highest transfection efficiency [121,175]. These 7C1 nanoparticles were later optimized to deliver Cas9 mRNA and sgRNA to splenic endothelial cells [94]. Khan [95,153,180]. Lastly, lipof",

            "text": "In vitro internalization in primary cultures of LSECs of the three FPM formulations with the specific ligands for CD32b, CD36 and integrin \u03b1 V \u03b2 3 receptors demonstrated that specific ligand-receptor interactions plus passive targeting promoted uptake by a greater number of healthy LSECs than the micelles conjugated with their scrambled variants. \n\nSimvastatin has been shown to reduce portal hypertension through the putative reduction in IHVR by means of several mechanisms, including the induction of KLF2 expression, related to the stimulation of a vasoprotective phenotype in LSECs [11,12,33]. This effect was confirmed by the expected overexpression of KLF2 in healthy isolated LSECs treated with free or encapsulated simvastatin. We also ruled out any possible effect of the empty functionalized nanodevices acting only as an inert vehicle for the delivery of the loaded drug. \n\nIntravenous treatment of healthy rats with the different fluorescent formulations confirms that, in all cases, functionalization confers greater efficiency in entering the main liver cells than passive targeting; the capture of FPMs was clearly superior to that achieved by non-functionalized PMs, and LSECs were the liver cells with the highest uptake. Furthermore, in endothelial cells, all three types of functionalization were equally effective. In vivo cell internalization experiments also confirmed that the receptors selected as LSEC targets for our nanoparticles were also expressed in healthy Kupffer cells and hepatocytes, allowing functionalized nanoparticles to enter both cell types quite efficiently. This was expected for CD36 and integrin \u03b1 V \u03b2 3 , as their expression in the liver is elevated not only in LSECs, but also in other hepatic cell types [34,35]. However, CD32b, an Fc\u03b3R conferring LSECs the highest endocytic capacity of any cell in the human body, is known to be the most specific marker of these cells in the liver. Yet, recent studies have shown that CD32b is not only expressed in LSECs but also in Kupffer cells, with a liver level expression of 90% and 10%, respectively [36].",

Besides special targeting of LSECs, there are other methods of liver fibrosis treatment that act via an indirect effect on LSECs, such as simultaneous consumption of LSECs and aHSCs (108), artificial control of the switch of the Erk1/2-Akt axis in LSECs to reverse LSECs from a proregenerative to a profibrotic phenotype (53), prevention of interstellar interaction of LSECs (109,110), selective enhancement of autophagy in LSEC in the early stages (111) and treatment of liver fibrosis with anti-angiogenic agents (112). Finally, a more detailed understanding of cytoskeletal structure and function of LSECs may help with the design of drugs that control fenestrae opening, which seems to be a simple and straightforward anti-liver fibrosis approach.",

This can be attributed to the difference in the type of siRNA used to target hepatocytes or LSECs (siFVII vs siCD31, respectively), which might have different gene silencing strengths. Furthermore, differences in cellular properties between hepatocytes and LSECs should also be considered. Another possible explanation is related to the low uptake of YSK05/12-LNP by Kupffer cells due to its cationic charge. However, this uptake is small compared with that of YSK12-C4-LNP (pKa 8.00), which could be taken up by Kupffer cells due to its highly cationic charge, and despite its strong activity in vitro, 36 it lost its activity completely in vivo. Moreover, the weak activity of the YSK12-C4-LNP could be attributed to its rapid disintegration in the blood stream and the leakage of siRNA. As shown in Figure S2, the siRNA was rapidly eliminated and detected in the kidney at 30 minutes after intravenous administration, possibly due to the high cationic charge of the LNP and its recognition by the reticuloendothelial system, while the lipids derived from LNPs were mostly distributed to lungs and, to a lower extent, the liver.",

            "text": "LSECs located in the hepatic sinusoids, are the first to contact hepatic blood flow and are also the earliest cells to be damaged in liver diseases. LSECs, unique endothelial cells with abundant window pore structures and no intact basement membrane constitute approximately 70% of the liver's NPCs. 100 LSECs secrete diverse cytokines that are crucial for inducing hepatocyte regeneration and maintaining the quiescence of HSCs. 101 Sources of LSECs in liver regeneration encompass bone marrow-derived sinusoidal endothelial precursor cells (BM-SPCs), mature LSECs and resident liver SPCs. Precise synchronisation between LSECs and hepatocytes is essential for liver regeneration. LSECs coordinate the release of cytokines and growth factors to promote hepatocyte proliferation, while hepatocytes also control the proliferation of LSECs. During PHx, there was an increase in hepatic vascular endothelial growth factor expression, leading to the recruitment of HGF-rich BM-SPCs through the stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1)/CXCR7 axis. 102 Nitric oxide (NO) secreted by LSECs sensitises hepatocytes to HGF, promoting liver regeneration. 103 During APAP-induced acute liver injury, LSECs secrete Wnt proteins and enhance HGF expression in the repair phase. This LSECs originated Wnt signal promotes \u03b2-catenin activation in hepatocytes, thus up-regulating target genes like cyclin D1 and driving hepatocyte proliferation. 104 In CCl 4 -induced acute liver injury, LSECs-mediated activation of c-Kit pathway facilitates liver repair via Wnt2-dependent manner. 105 In studies on NASH, LSECs secrete cytokines and extensively interact with cholangiocytes, HSCs and other NPCs. In LSECs of NASH livers, expression of genes related with lipid metabolism was up-regulated and those for vascular homeostasis were down-regulated, resulting in the destruction of capillaries in hepatic sinusoids.",

Fibrosis is an active research field and discoveries in the last years have contributed to the development of new antifibrotic drugs, although none of them have been approved yet. Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) are highly specialized endothelial cells localized at the interface between the blood and other liver cell types. They lack a basement membrane and display open channels (fenestrae), making them exceptionally permeable. LSEC are the first cells affected by any kind of liver injury orchestrating the liver response to damage. LSEC govern the regenerative process initiation, but aberrant LSEC activation in chronic liver injury induces fibrosis. LSEC are also main players in fibrosis resolution. They maintain liver homeostasis and keep hepatic stellate cell and Kupffer cell quiescence. After sustained hepatic injury, they lose their phenotype and protective properties, promoting angiogenesis and vasoconstriction and contributing to inflammation and fibrosis. Therefore, improving LSEC phenotype is a promising strategy to prevent liver injury progression and complications. This review focuses on changes occurring in LSEC after liver injury and their consequences on fibrosis progression, liver regeneration, and resolution. Finally, a synopsis of the available strategies for LSEC-specific targeting is provided.",

Apart from the above-mentioned methods, the use of quantum dot (QD) nanoparticles (1-20 nm) for the treatment of NAFLD has also emerged as an area of great interest [193]. An intravenous injection of mercaptosuccinic acid (MSA)-capped cadmium telluride/cadmium sulfide (CdTe/CdS/QDs) showed that negatively charged QDs were selectively taken up by sinusoidal cells (KCs and LSECs) in rat liver, indicating that CdTe/CdS/QDs can be used for drug delivery to the LSECs [194]. Furthermore, Zn-labelled CdSelenide/CdS/ZnS QDs were also found in the KCs and LSECs 2h after an intravenous injection of polymer-coated Qdots, indicating their efficiency in drug delivery to the sinusoidal cells [195]. In addition, via the usage of nanoparticles carrying honokiol or adenovirus with the endothelial-cell-specific arginylglycylaspartic acid-roundabout guidance receptor 4 (RGD-ROBO4), ERK1/2 activation was promoted, leading to induced liver regeneration and reduced hepatic fibrosis due to high degree of LSEC specificity [196]. \n\nThe main studies targeting endothelial dysfunction in animal models of NAFLD/NASH/cirrhosis are summarized in Table 1. \n\nTable 1.

Moreover, lipid NPs carrying procollagen \u03b1 I(I) siRNA remarkably reduced the total hepatic collagen content, leading to an alleviation of NASH progression and accelerating the regression of hepatic fibrosis in CCL4-induced NASH in Balb/c mice [191]. In another attempt, CXCR4-targeted lipid-based NPs carrying VEGF siRNA were used for the treatment of liver fibrosis and hepatic cellular carcinoma; a combination therapy using both AMD-NPs (CXCR4 inhibitor) and VEGF siRNA abolished the infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages and reduced HCC tumor growth [192]. Apart from the above-mentioned methods, the use of quantum dot (QD) nanoparticles (1-20 nm) for the treatment of NAFLD has also emerged as an area of great interest [193]. An intravenous injection of mercaptosuccinic acid (MSA)-capped cadmium telluride/cadmium sulfide (CdTe/CdS/QDs) showed that negatively charged QDs were selectively taken up by sinusoidal cells (KCs and LSECs) in rat liver, indicating that CdTe/CdS/QDs can be used for drug delivery to the LSECs [194].",

To expand the scope of LNPs to non-hepatic cells, Cheng et al. developed selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles and achieved spleen-and lungselective mRNA delivery by incorporating anionic phospholipids and permanently cationic lipids into conventional four-component LNPs, respectively (Cheng et al. 2020). SORT LNPs were reported to follow a similar mechanism to conventional LNPs for organ targeting, but they adsorbed different types of serum proteins by distinct surface charges, which might direct them to non-liver organs (Dilliard et al. 2021). Different from endogenous targeting via serum proteins, numerous ligands were utilized to functionalize LNPs to achieve targeted nucleic acid delivery through active targeting. In this section, we summarize the currently reachable organs and cell types by ligand-modified nucleic acid-LNPs (supplementary Table S2).",

The morphology of the LSECs was assessed on days 2 and 4 of culturing by immunofluorescence microscopy. The cells grew by static adherence; the cells exhibited a fusiform or polygon shape, resembling cobblestones (Fig. 1a). The cells were identified by immunofluorescence using an anti-CD31 antibody. Consistent with previous reports, 10,19,20 the results indicated that CD31 was constitutively expressed in cultured LSECs (Fig. 1b). ORO and HE staining for lipid droplets analysis revealed the presence of many lipid droplets in LSECs and liver tissue when treated with ox-LDL (Fig. 1c,d). In the control group, most LSECs had no lipid droplets, indicating a low intracellular lipid content. In the ox-LDL group, many lipid droplets could be observed in the cytoplasm.\n\n2. ERK inhibitor attenuates ox-LDL-induced hepatic scaffold structure damage.\n\nConsistently, compared with the control group, HE staining showed that the structure of hepatocytes in the ox-LDL group was loose with a disorderly arrangement. Many lipid droplets were observed in the cytoplasm, revealing obvious LSEC injury (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis), and the scaffold structure was broken (Fig. 1d). Compared with the ox-LDL group, PD98059 significantly improved liver injury and attenuated non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, improving the integration of the scaffold structure (Fig. 1d). GMS staining revealed that the ox-LDL group had a broken scaffold structure. In the control group, liver tissues showed intact scaffold structures with black continuous reticular fibers in parallel at the hepatic cords. The liver sections of the ox-LDL group exhibited severe broken hepatic scaffolds with fragmented silver nitrate deposits scattered in the hepatic tissue. In contrast, in the PD98059 group, the severe broken hepatic scaffold structure was not evident, and silver nitrate deposits",

However, we decided to compare their intrahepatic distribution by observing liver tissues that had been injected with DiI-labeled LNP encapsulating a mixture of siRNA (siGL4:siCy5-GFP 1:1 ratio) at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg of both siRNAs using CLSM. Although the injected siRNA dose was higher than that used for obtaining gene silencing (0.5 vs 0.1 mg/kg, respectively), it was selected to enable us to visualize hepatic distribution with high sensitivity and clarity. \n\nWe observed the LNP containing the YSK05 lipid only (YSK05-LNP) and a pKa of 6.50 was extensively taken up by hepatocytes (Figure 6, upper). In the image, the YSK05-LNP (represented in red color) is extensively distributed in hepatocytes, which are the most abundant cells in the liver and are defined in the image as the nonfluorescent areas that are infiltrated with LSECs which are shown in green color. On the other hand, the YSK05/12-LNP with a pKa value of 7.15 was highly taken up by LSECs (Figure 6, lower). In the image, YSK05/12-LNP (represented in red) is distributed on LSECs (the green color of LSECs turned into red or orange because of LNP accumulation in this area). These results suggest that, despite the similar hepatic biodistribution of YSK05-LNP and YSK05/12-LNP, as shown in Figure S2, their intrahepatic distribution varied depending on their pKa value.",

Recently a study showed that TiO 2 NPs could restore sinusoidal permeability by inducing transient leakiness in primary human hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells (HHSECs), which could improve hepatic recovery and upregulate drug uptake (Tee et al., 2018). \n\nMoreover, in blood, over 90% of hyaluronic acid (HA) is taken and metabolized by LSECs due to the receptors on them (DeLeve and Maretti-Mira, 2017). Therefore, HA modified delivery systems can be used for LSEC targeting in liver fibrosis. Ohya et al. developed biodegradable polyanion-coated polymeric micelles conjugated with HA by polyion complex (PIC) formation, which were taken up only into LSECs (Ohya et al., 2011). \n\nIt has been reported that rather than hepatocytes, LSECs play the key role in the initial uptake of virus into the liver in a hepatitis B virus model. Fluorescent viral particles and virus proteincoated gold particles exhibited a preferential uptake of the viral substrates into LSECs (Breiner et al., 2001). Thus, utilizing viral pathways of cell targeting in liver might be a candidate for drug delivery to fibrotic liver. Abel et al. prepared mouse CD105-specific lentiviral vectors (mCD105-LV) that can specifically transduce LSECs (Abel et al., 2013). Another work took use of the endocytic uptake by LSECs to deliver antigens to the liver (Liu et al., 2021). The tolerogenic nanoparticles (TNPs) attached ApoBP ligand presented antigens to regulate the differentiation of naive T-cells into Tregs (Figure 5). It seems that LSECs-targeting antigen delivery might be a hopeful candidate in the immune regulation for autoimmune disorders, such as autoimmune hepatitis.",

            "text": "The term \"liver gene therapy\" is often used to unilaterally describe all gene therapy approaches for treating diseases originating in hepatocytes. Although hepatocytes are the most prominent cell type within the liver, several other cell types can interact with nanoparticles and affect their performance [41][42][43][44]. It is therefore recommended that scientists expand their LNP studies to include single cell quantification rather than the whole liver. Every liver lobule comprises parenchymal (i.e. hepatocytes) and non-parenchymal liver cells (i.e. LSECs and Kupffer cells). In addition to these three major cell types, the liver consists of several other cell populations. A recent study revealed 20 discrete cell types ranging from stellate cells (also known as Ito cells) and cholangiocytes to immune cells such as B, T, or NK-like cells [45]. The human liver cell atlas revealed additional subtypes within the liver microenvironment [46]. The most relevant cell types and their implications for LNP-based gene therapy are discussed in the next sections, following the particle's journey in the body after systemic administration [47].\n\nFollowing intravenous injection, LNP-siRNA systems (composed of CLinDMA:Cholesterol:PEG-DMG; 50:44:6 mol%) accumulate in all major liver cell types (i.e. Kupffer cells, LSECs, and hepatocytes) in a time-and dose-dependent manner, as demonstrated by Shi et al. [49]. When LNP-siRNA were administered at 0.3 mg siRNA/kg, similar siRNA amounts were detected in Kupffer cells and hepatocytes. Doses of 1 mg/kg to 9 mg/kg siRNA delivered 50% to 83%, respectively, to hepatocytes. At 30 minutes post injection, LNPs were mainly localized in the space of Disse, whereas 2 hours post injection LNPs accumulated in hepatocytes. siRNAs delivered to Kupffer cells and LSECs were inactive, but delivery to hepatocytes resulted in efficient gene silencing.

            "text": "LNPs containing ionizable lipids have been studied for the systemic delivery of RNA therapeutics, but designing nanoparticles that can be delivered to target tissues beyond the liver remains challenging [38]. Most of the currently studied LNPs show affinity for the liver because it is a well-perfused organ that can take up intravenously injected cargo, and the slow blood flow and sinusoidal vasculature of the liver also play a role in aiding LNP distribution [39,40]. In addition, neutrally charged LNPs that enter the bloodstream bind to apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which is taken up through low-density lipoprotein receptors distributed in the liver [41]. Thus, neutral LNPs can rapidly accumulate in the liver without using ligands for molecules overexpressed by hepatocytes. Even if the LNP surface is PEGylated, it has been reported that PEGylated lipids and ApoE proteins are exchanged after injection into the bloodstream [42]. \n\nThe challenge in expanding the use of LNPs is evolving them to have different tropisms in vivo [39]. Attempts have been made to modulate the surface charge of LNPs in order to deliver drugs to organs other than the liver. Lung-specific mRNA delivery has been achieved by increasing the proportion of persistent cationic lipids in LNPs; conversely, spleen-specific mRNA distribution has been observed when the surface negative charge is high [32]. \n\nThe method of reducing the diameter of the nanoparticles for tumor penetration has also been studied. Using a microfluidic mixing technique, siRNA-LNPs with sizes of less than 50 nm were prepared and efficiently invaded the tumor microenvironment [20]. In another study, improved penetration into diseased tissues, such as tumors, was observed using LNPs with a diameter of 30 nm [18]. Recently, it was shown that LNPs as small as 20 nm in diameter can be produced by increasing the PEGylation ratio using microfluidic technology. These small LNPs are applicable not only to tumors but also to metastatic lymph nodes.",

One recent publication compared a series of synthesized ionizable LNPs in terms of their ability to target liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs); the LNPs had varied PEG percentages and nanoparticle sizes [120]. In another study, Siegwart's group designed Selective ORgan Targeting (SORT) nanoparticles by incorporating certain molecules into lipid nanoparticles comprised of ionizable lipids, cholesterol, DSPC and PEG. The resulting SORT nanoparticles tuned mRNA release based on modulation of internal charge and thereby facilitated delivery to specific tissue types [141]. Since tuning ionizable lipids based on organ or cell type may be difficult to achieve in clinical practice, targeting of LNPs with specific ligands may be the best strategy. Ligand-mediated targeting has been shown to mediate delivery nucleic acid cargos to specific cell types overexpressing the receptor [192]. Targeting of mRNA-LNPs can be achieved by introducing the targeting ligands during LNP production or by post-insertion of targeting ligands into the mRNA-LNP. Recent studies have shown that different targeting ligands can be inserted into mRNA-LNPs to specifically target immune cells, cardiac cells and liver cells. The research field of targeting mRNA-LNPs is still in its infancy, with relatively few publications available. Table 7 summarizes the different ligands utilized to target mRNA-LNPs to different cell types.",

In particular, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and Kupffer cells take up a large proportion of nanoparticles after systemic administration, decreasing their circulation time. To reduce nanovehicle capture, Saunders et al. 115 designed a liposome with a highly negative surface charge (\u00c099.4 mV) and large size (259 nm). After intravenous injection, liposomes with these unique physicochemical properties transiently occupied the MPS and thus decreased the uptake of siRNA-loaded LNPs by Kupffer cells and LSECs, prolonging their retention in blood. Ultimately, through the action of a nanoprimer, LNPs carrying human erythropoietin (hEPO) mRNA or factor VII (FVII) siRNA increased hEPO production (by 32%) or enhanced FVII silencing (by 49%).",

A similar intrahepatic distribution has recently been described for LNP-DNA barcode systems (composed of MC3 or cKK-E12) by Sago et al. [50]. However, direct comparison of datasets carried out with different LNP systems, including variations in the lipid composition, ionizable lipid, lipid-nucleic acid ratios, and nucleic acid type must be assessed with caution. At a dose of 0.3 mg DNA /kg, LNPs accumulated in all three major liver cell types, with higher doses in Kupffer cells and hepatocytes than endothelial cells. In sharp contrast, gene expression following LNP-mediated mRNA delivery demonstrated an inverse hierarchy among hepatic cells: endothelial cells > Kupffer cells > hepatocytes. Higher LNP doses corresponding to 1 mg/kg mRNA shifted expression slightly towards hepatocytes while keeping the same pattern. Transfection of all major liver cell types with equal potency was recently demonstrated for LNP-mRNA systems (composed of branched-tail 306O i10 ) at a dose of 2 mg RNA/kg by Hajj et al. [51].\n\nIndeed, targeting the right cell type with the right dose is crucial to developing effective therapeutics. It should be noted that the LNP compositions described in these preclinical studies deviate from those used in the clinic (except for MC3-based LNPs). Systematic studies are therefore needed to improve our fundamental understanding of LNPs' in vivo behavior. Rigorous control of physicochemical LNP characteristics such as size distribution, zeta potential, and entrapment will be crucial to assess the intrahepatic distribution of a single LNP composition with different payloads.",

The delivery approach that is both most widely used and most clinically advanced is to complex anionic oligonucleotides with cationic lipids thus forming lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) (161)(162)(163). This approach has been especially important for therapeutic use of siRNA (164) and good accounts of current clinical trials using siRNA LNPs are found in recent reviews (10,165). In addition to the cationic lipid, LNPs typically include a neutral lipid such as cholesterol, but a variety of compositions are possible. While simple LNPs are effective as cell culture transfection agents, they cannot be used in vivo because extensive interactions with opsonic proteins in blood lead to rapid clearance by RES phagocytes. LNPs for in vivo use are usually 100-200 nm in size and include a surface coating of a neutral polymer such as PEG to minimize protein binding and uptake by RES cells. This allows greater persistence in the circulation and the opportunity to interact with other cell types. However, because of their size, LNPs can only exit the circulation at sites where the endothelial barrier is fenestrated, particularly liver, spleen and certain tumors having a high EPR effect. Because of this, much of the work with siRNA-LNPs has focused on liver diseases including transthyrethrin-mediated amyloidosis, clotting disorders, liver cancer and disorders of lipid metabolism (11,166). \n\nThe action of LNPs involves initial uptake by endocytosis. In some cases this is mediated by the binding of apolipoprotein E and interaction with the LDL receptor (167). Once in endosomes, the cationic lipids of the LNP interact with anionic membrane lipids to disrupt membrane structure through the formation of a non-bilayer lipid phase termed inverted hexagonal (H II ). This leads both to increased membrane permeability and to dissolution of the LNP and is the basis for conveying the oligonucleotide to the cytosol (168).",

            "text": "Obesity and insulin resistance can cause NAFLD, which is characterized by liver metabolic dysregulation, such as hyperlipidemia (95). Recent epidemiology of NAFLD and its connection with CVD suggest that blocking endothelial dysfunction would be beneficial (96), since endothelial function is impaired in patients with NAFLD (97).\n\nLiver sinusoidal endothelial cells are highly specialized ECs, which form the wall of liver sinusoids and represent up to 20% of liver cells (98). LSECs are well known for their crucial roles in liver regeneration (99)(100)(101) and chronic liver diseases associated with obesity (e.g., fibrosis) (102). LSECs maintain hepatic stellate cells and hepatocytes in quiescence at basal condition but induce hepatocyte proliferation and angiogenesis during regeneration and undergo morphological and functional changes during fibrosis (103). It is believed that LSECs accomplish these by interacting with other hepatic cell types to maintain liver homeostasis. Since healthy LSECs facilitate the rapid transfer of fatty acids formed from cholesteryl esters to parenchymal cells, LSECs injury contributes to NAFLD (104). LSECs injury has been associated with NAFLD progression, where NAFLD may alter LSECs-mediated transport of nutrients, lipids, and lipoproteins. A recent study in choline-deficient, l-amino acid-defined, and high-fat diet models that mimic human NAFLD indicated that LSEC injury functions as \"gatekeeper\" in the progression from simple steatosis to the early non-alcoholic steatohepatitis stage, and LSEC injury may activate Kupffer cells and hepatic stellate cells, which in turn results in chronic liver injuries (105). In this regard, LSECs operate as a traffic-director at the crossroad of regeneration and fibrosis (106). It is yet to be determined whether LSEC-derived factors are required for this function.",

In addition, via the usage of nanoparticles carrying honokiol or adenovirus with the endothelial-cell-specific arginylglycylaspartic acid-roundabout guidance receptor 4 (RGD-ROBO4), ERK1/2 activation was promoted, leading to induced liver regeneration and reduced hepatic fibrosis due to high degree of LSEC specificity [196]. \n\nThe main studies targeting endothelial dysfunction in animal models of NAFLD/NASH/cirrhosis are summarized in Table 1.

Intravenously injected NPs are usually trapped in the liver owing to the special structure of hepatic sinusoids, resulting in high endocytosis by hepatocytes, hepatic endothelial cells, and Kupffer cells [62,133]. For example, LNPs were first opsonized by apolipoprotein E (ApoE) in the blood circulation after intravenous injection and entered the hepatocytes by binding to the ApoE receptor on the surfaces of hepatocytes [134,135].

FVII assays have been used to study hundreds of chemically distinct nanoparticles in vivo, leading to the discovery of an LNP that delivered siRNA to mice at a dose of 0.01 mg kg \u22121 , and subsequently patisiran. [74] Historically, it has been more challenging to evaluate cell typespecific delivery to other cell types in vivo. This may partially explain why other cells and tissues that share important physiological traits that promote delivery to the liver have not had the same degree of clinical success to date. For example, endothelial cells are physically accessible to nanoparticles injected into the blood; the bone marrow contains discontinuous endothelium, which could promote nanoparticle extravasation from the blood; and the spleen has a specialized structure that likely dramatically increases nanoparticle resonance time within the organ. Yet a growing number of publications have shown that effective nonliver delivery is possible in mice and nonhuman primates. In one example, screening epoxide-modified lipid-polymer hybrids at different lipid:RNA ratios in vitro resulted in the identification of an LNP containing a new lipid-bas ed compound, termed 7C1, that potently delivers siRNA to heart (ED 50 \u2248 0.05 mg kg \u22121 ) and lung (ED 50 \u2248 0.02 mg kg \u22121 ) endothelial cells in mice after a single systemic injection. [75] This same LNP was validated in NHPs, where researchers saw up to 80% protein silencing in lung endothelial cells after a 1 mg kg \u22121 systemic administration. [76] Other researchers have delivered RNA to the lung by altering the phospholipid molar ratio. Increasing the phospholipid molar ratio of LNPs formulated with the hepatocyte-targeting ionizable lipid cKK-E12 led to potent and specific mRNA delivery to the lungs with minimal off-target delivery detected in the liver and spleen. [77] More recently, selective organ targeting (SORT) was used to deliver mRNA to nonliver tissues by including a supplemental SORT lipid. [78] Researchers used SORT to demonstrate that increasing",

However, systemically delivering RNA drugs to nonliver tissues remains an important challenge. To increase the number of nanoparticles that could be studied in vivo, we designed a high-throughput method to measure how >100 nanoparticles delivered mRNA that was translated into functional protein in vivo. We quantified how >250 lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) delivered mRNA in vivo, identifying two LNPs that deliver mRNA to endothelial cells. One of the LNPs codelivered Cas9 mRNA and single-guide RNA in vivo, leading to endothelial cell gene editing. This approach can identify nanoparticles that target new cells. Dysfunctional endothelium causes more disease than any other cell type. Systemically administered RNA delivery to nonliver tissues remains challenging, in large part because there is no high-throughput method to identify nanoparticles that deliver functional mRNA to cells in vivo. Here we report a system capable of simultaneously quantifying how >100 lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) deliver mRNA that is translated into functional protein. Using this system (named FIND), we measured how >250 LNPs delivered mRNA to multiple cell types in vivo and identified 7C2 and 7C3, two LNPs that efficiently deliver siRNA, single-guide RNA (sgRNA), and mRNA to endothelial cells. The 7C3 delivered Cas9 mRNA and sgRNA to splenic endothelial cells as efficiently as hepatocytes, distinguishing it from LNPs that deliver Cas9 mRNA and sgRNA to hepatocytes more than other cell types. These data demonstrate that FIND can identify nanoparticles with novel tropisms in vivo.",

            "text": "Improvements in RNA delivery systems based on LNPs yielded impressive results in the last few years. Nevertheless, the use of LNPs for targeted delivery to desired organs still requires optimization of lipid composition. In our review, we discussed successful examples of variations of lipid composition for targeted delivery to the spleen, lungs, pancreas, thyroid gland, placenta, and testes. Distribution of LNPs to the liver is the most typical after intravenous administration, especially for nanoparticles smaller than 100 nm. Through changes in lipid composition, it is possible to achieve preferential (in some cases, complete) redirection of nanoparticle accumulation to other organs. Apparent pK a of LNPs plays an important role in this effect. For instance, nanoparticles having pK a < 5 (they possess a negative charge in the bloodstream) tend to accumulate in the spleen, whereas particles with pK a > 11 (positive charge) in lungs. A desired value of apparent pK a of LNPs can be achieved by changing the helper lipid (SORT technology) and/or by using a combination of several ionizable cationic lipids. Application of bulkier lipids indirectly affects apparent pK a of LNPs by altering the packing of lipids in the nanoparticle and thereby changing the accessibility of ionizable groups of lipids to protonation. Redirection of LNP accumulation to the spleen can be accomplished via reductions in the amount of \"liver-specific\" cholesterol in the nanoparticles. On the other hand, for some organs, such as eyes and the brain, effective delivery systems based on LNPs have not yet been devised, and in this case, delivery to the target organ is achieved only via direct administration of the therapeutic agent. \n\nAt present, computer technologies are actively utilized to design and improve LNPs: from computer modeling to machine learning and artificial intelligence (Du et al., 2023;Maharjan et al., 2023;Cornebise et al., 2021). During the development of new ionizable lipids, the most time-consuming task is the screening of large numbers of diverse LNPs.",

            "text": "administration [54]. Moreover, it has been extensively demonstrated that the physicochemical similarity of the commonly referred to as LNPs to VLDL and the propensity to adsorb ApoE in blood plasma, enhances the accumulation of this kind of lipid systems in the liver and the internalization into hepatocytes via the LDL receptor [81]. Although the reports identified here for active liver targeting highlight the extensive efforts and strategies employed to efficiently deliver therapeutic nucleic acids to hepatocytes, LNPs have emerged as the most advanced non-viral carriers for delivering nucleic acids to liver. However, the hepatocyte-targeting ability of LNPs relays on endogenous mechanisms, and for this reason, scarce studies involving LNPs have been identified in this systematic review, focused on active targeting. In this regard, LNPs lacking any active targeting ligand have been studied to deliver mRNA encoding \u03b1-Gal A to hepatocytes of Fabry mice and non-human primates after i.v. administration [82,83]. Despite further studies with these LNPs have not been reported up to date, initial results showed the production of functional \u03b1-Gal A in the liver, which then was secreted into the circulation. Secreted \u03b1-Gal A was taken up by distal tissues such as kidney, heart, and spleen and attenuated substrate accumulation in affected tissues. These hallmarks, while valuable for liver hepatocyte applications, severely limit the use of these LNP technologies beyond the liver. Recently, a methodology termed selective organ targeting (SORT) has been developed, which enables controllable delivery of nucleic acids to target tissues [65]. SORT LNPs involve the inclusion of SORT molecules, such as chargebased lipids, that accurately tune delivery to extrahepatic tissues after i.v. administration. This strategy, added to the recognized efficacy of LNPs, represents a great advance in the development of systems targeting extrahepatic organs, and it has been included in at least two patents [84,85].",

            "text": "The endothelial system of liver with fenestrae is different from other tissues, which endows nanodrugs with unique advantages for therapeutic purposes (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, modification of nanodrugs in terms of physical (including size, shape, and uniformity), chemical (including composition, charge, and surface coating) and biological (including encapsulated compounds and specific conjugated ligands) features facilitate their efficient and selective targeting of pathology sites [141,142]. Nanodrugs cannot penetrate the vascular endothelial system of normal non-hepatic tissues (Fig. 6B) and nanoparticles tend to accumulate and target lesions with incomplete endothelial lining and basement membrane [143][144][145][146]. Overall, 30-99% nanodrugs are reported to aggregate in the liver after administration into the body via different routes [147]. \n\nDue to the fenestrated sieve plates between LSECs, which range from 50 to 180 nm in humans or up to 280 nm in mice and rats [5], smaller nanodrugs directly pass the sinusoid into disse of space. Nanodrugs are also taken up by LSECs through receptor-ligand interactions and subsequently LSECs transported to disse of space if not consumed. Subsequently, nanodrugs in the disse interact with hepatocytes, leading to their uptake. Modification of nanodrugs, such as alterations in targeting molecules, PEGylation, and imparting positive charges on the surface, can also greatly increase uptake by hepatocytes [148,149]. In addition, larger nanoparticles tend to be captured by KCs after entering hepatic sinusoids through portal vein or hepatic artery due to their greater surface area for interactions [147,150]. Considering the critical role of KC-related inflammation in liver injury, enrichment of anti-inflammatory and antioxidant nanoparticles in KCs also provides favorable conditions for treatment (Fig. 6C). Notably, sinusoid capillarization occurs when LSECs are injured during liver injury, especially chronic liver injury and liver fibrosis.",

Additionally, it is involved in various pathological processes, including steatosis, inflammation, fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the rapid dedifferentiation of LSECs after culture greatly limits their use in vitro modeling for biomedical applications. In this study, we developed a highly efficient protocol to induce LSEC-like cells from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) in only 8 days. Using single-cell transcriptomic analysis, we identified several novel LSEC-specific markers, such as EPAS1, LIFR, and NID1, as well as several previously revealed markers, such as CLEC4M, CLEC1B, CRHBP and FCN3. These LSEC markers are specifically expressed in our LSEC-like cells. Furthermore, hiPSC-derived cells expressed LSEC-specific proteins and exhibited LSEC-related functions, such as the uptake of acetylated low density lipoprotein (ac-LDL) and immune complex endocytosis. Overall, this study confirmed that our novel protocol allowed hiPSCs to rapidly acquire an LSEC-like phenotype and function in vitro. The ability to generate LSECs efficiently and rapidly may help to more precisely mimic liver development and disease progression in a liver-specific multicellular microenvironment, offering new insights into the development of novel therapeutic strategies.",

However, no specific drug has been approved for clinical use to treat patients with NASH, though there are many promising candidates against NAFLD in the drug development pipeline. Recently, accumulated evidence showed that liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) play an essential role in the occurrence and development of liver inflammation in patients with NAFLD. LSECs, as highly specialized endothelial cells with unique structure and anatomical location, contribute to the maintenance of liver homeostasis and could be a promising therapeutic target to control liver inflammation of NAFLD. In this review, we outline the pathophysiological roles of LSECs related to inflammation of NAFLD, highlight the pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects of LSECs, and discuss the potential drug development strategies against NAFLD based on targeting to LSECs.",

            "text": "As stated above, targeted delivery of LNPs to organs is determined by the charge, not by the nature of the polar group in a helper lipid. For instance, for nanoparticles containing anionic phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylglycerol, or phosphatidic acid, researchers have observed more specific delivery to the spleen (60%, 50%, and 75%, respectively) than to the liver (20%, 45%, and 5%, respectively) (LoPresti et al., 2022). On the other hand, another group of authors (Pattipeiluhu et al., 2022) has reported that for LNPs containing phosphatidylglycerol, accumulation in the liver occurs predominantly in sinusoidal endothelial cells and Kupffer cells, in contrast to phosphatidylcholine-containing LNPs, whose accumulation takes place equally in hepatocytes, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, and Kupffer cells. \n\nThe introduction of an additional charged helper lipid as a fifth component also enables investigators to alter targeting efficiency of LNPs. Not so long ago (Dilliard et al., 2021), scientists achieved almost 100% reporter mRNA expression in the liver, spleen, or lungs by means of an additional neutral, negatively, or positively charged lipid, respectively. Targeting to an organ depended there on apparent pK a of nanoparticles: at pK a < 5, the particles accumulated mainly in the spleen; at pK a of 6.2-6.4, mainly in the liver; whereas at pK a > 11, mainly in lungs. It is noteworthy that at pK a of 6.5-11, there was selective distribution of LNPs into the lungs and spleen at different levels, indicating a nonobvious dependence of the LNP biodistribution on the charge. It is likely that pK a can serve as a good predictor of bioactivity. For classic fourcomponent LNPs, apparent pK a was 6.3-6.6 in the above study, depending on the ionizable cationic lipid used.",

            "text": "Our study showed that liver-derived cell models demonstrated greater sensitivity to endosomal disruption from MC3-LNPs than non-liver cell models without equivalent differences in the level of particle uptake, providing a more detailed understanding to the observation by Sayers et al. that LNPs are differently effective in liver-derived Huh7 compared to lung-derived NCI-H358 47 . Examination of a wider range of LNP formulations and cationic lipids will be important to determine whether this is an intrinsic sensitivity of these cell models to nanoparticle delivery or whether this is indicative of a composition-driven LNP selectivity for certain cell types. Similarly, integrating the mCherry-GAL9 into a broader range of cellular models will be important for screening particle formulations for the identification of parameters important for selective uptake to ultimately facilitate selective organ targeting in vivo. \n\nBy improving our understanding of LNP characteristics that are critical to achieve particle uptake and endosomal escape across cellular models, we can ideally achieve therapeutic doses using lower amounts of potentially immunogenic lipid carriers and reduce the costs for future potential treatments. Identification of novel particle formulations will undoubtably require considerable efforts to screen nanoparticle variations in a robust manner, we believe this assay forms a fundamental basis for future screening endeavours to progress the development of drug delivery systems.",

            "text": "Simple Summary Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome. With the prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes, NAFLD is becoming the most common liver disorder worldwide. More than 10% of NAFLD patients progress to an inflammatory and fibrotic form called nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which can lead to end-stage liver disease. Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) are highly specialized cells located at the interface between the flowing blood in the liver and the other liver cells. The current review highlights the recent knowledge of the role of LSEC in the development of NASH, and how LSEC change their structure and function during NAFLD progression. Moreover, the review discusses the pathogenic role of nanometer-sized particles called extracellular vesicles that mediate intercellular communication in the NASH liver. The current manuscript has a special emphasis on the role of adhesion molecules expressed on the LSEC surface in the recruitment of circulating leukocytes to the liver, a critical step in liver inflammation in NASH. Furthermore, the review shed some lights on LSEC-targeted potential therapeutic strategies in NASH. Abstract Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) has become a growing public health problem worldwide, yet its pathophysiology remains unclear. Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) have unique morphology and function, and play a critical role in liver homeostasis. Emerging literature implicates LSEC in many pathological processes in the liver, including metabolic dysregulation, inflammation, angiogenesis, and carcinogenesis. In this review, we highlight the current knowledge of the role of LSEC in each of the progressive phases of NASH pathophysiology (steatosis, inflammation, fibrosis, and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma). We discuss processes that have important roles in NASH progression including the detrimental transformation of LSEC called \u201ccapillarization\u201d, production of inflammatory and profibrogenic mediators by LSEC as well as LSEC-mediated angiogenesis. The current review has a special emphasis on LSEC adhesion molecules, and their key role in the",

            "text": "The liver constitutes one of the largest organs of the body and exerts numerous essential functions associated with digestion, metabolism, protein synthesis and the detoxification of xenobiotics [1]. Hence, the liver is a primary site of various metabolic disorders [2]. Further, chronic hepatitis [3] and metabolic disorders [4] may result in liver fibrosis or even cirrhosis. Cirrhosis is considered a premalignant state as 80% of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most frequent type of primary liver cancer, develop in cirrhotic livers [5]. In addition, due to anatomical reasons, the liver is also a primary organ of tumor metastasis [6]. The therapy of liver tumors is complicated by the default tolerogenic state of liver-resident non-parenchymal cells (NPCs) [7]. Hence, the liver, with its different specialized cell types, is a highly interesting target organ for cell-type-addressing nanoformulations, thereby avoiding adverse side effects, such as systemic toxicity [8]. However, as outlined in this review, the structure of the liver has proven a challenge for nano-based cell-targeting approaches. \n\nOn the one hand, the liver acts as a biological barrier and may sequestrate the vast majority of administered nanoparticles (NPs) from the bloodstream, when particles (>6 nm) are not eliminated by the kidney [9]. However, on the other hand, within the liver NPs need to pass several biological barriers hindering their successful uptake by the different liver cell populations [10]. In this regard, NPs intended to address hepatocytes need to cross the sinusoidal fenestrations of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) [11,12]. Furthermore, Kupffer cells (KCs), that constitute the major liver-resident macrophage population [13], and LSECs express various types of Fc and scavenger receptors [14] for the efficient uptake of larger KC [13] and smaller LSEC [15] macromolecules, and consequently also NPs [9].",

While AAV vectors exhibit tropism to specific cell types or tissues by using different capsid proteins, their specificity is not absolute [81,106]. Although lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) lack the tissue tropism of AAV vectors [107e109], their preferential accumulation in the liver, through an apoE-dependent process [110], is ideal for delivering VLDLR to the liver for the treatment of hyperlipidemia. To further enhance the specificity of this targeting, hepatocyte-specific ligands such as N-acetyl-D-galactosamine (GalNAc) can be incorporated into the LNPs to target hepatocyte receptors [111]. In addition, LNP-based delivery systems theoretically offer unlimited packaging capacity [112e114], while viral vectors have a cargo size limitation (4.7 kB for AAVs) [115]. Moreover, non-viral vectorsdsuch as cationic lipids and LNPsdare potentially safer than viral vectors due to the absence of immunogenic viral proteins.",

[31,32] In large part, LSEC clearance of macromolecular waste and pathogens is mediated through an array of scavenger receptors (e.g., hyaluronan and stabilin receptors), expressed on the luminal membrane of LSECs.

[37] Guided by a mechanistic understanding of the systemic clearance of i.v. administered anionic nanoparticles by hepatic RES cell types, [38] here, we rationally design anionic LNPs to preferentially target and transfect the hepatic RES, i.e., scavenger receptor LNPs (srLNPs). This required just a single lipid compositional change within the formulation of Onpattro. Using the embryonic zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a convenient, accurate, and cost-effective in vivo model, [39] we qualitatively describe LNP biodistribution, mRNA delivery, and expression of an exogenous fluorescent protein in vivo, at cellular resolution and in real time, focusing particularly on relative LNP uptake and mRNA expression within SECs, macrophages, and hepatocytes of the embryo.

LNPs, particularly those with ionizable lipids, exhibit tissue tropism influenced by their charge, as observed in ApoE-dependent hepatic uptake [64]. To address excessive liver homing, a selective organ-targeting (SORT) strategy has been explored, incorporating specific lipid classes into LNPs for tissue-specific gene delivery [65]. Manipulating the charge of formulated LNPs using SORT molecules, such as DOTAP or 18PA, allows for lung-or spleen-specific gene delivery, demonstrating adaptability for therapeutic goals. Additionally, strategies for targeting specific cell subsets in the liver, such as hepatocytes and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, have been pursued by adjusting particle size and incorporating targeting ligands [65]. \n\nNovel ionizable amino lipids and an ASSET system, utilizing cell-targeting antibodies, have been employed to enhance tissue specificity [66]. Although challenges persist in achieving systemic delivery into tumors, RNA-lipoplexes (RNA-LPX) have shown promise in cancer immunotherapy by targeting antigen-presenting cells and inducing T-cell activation. The modRNA, such as 1-methylpseudouridine (m1\u03a8) RNA, contributes to reduced inflammatory responses and improved therapeutic outcomes in autoimmune disease models [22,67]. These studies underscore the importance of careful LNP design and RNA modification for tissue-specific delivery and therapeutic efficacy, providing valuable insights for advancing RNA-based therapeutics.",

            "text": "The liver tropism limitation of conventional LNPs substantially drives the development of non-hepatic organ-and specific cell type-targeted LNPs by surface engineering with various targeting ligands. Recently, surface engineering strategies were also utilized to improve the performance and other properties of LNPs beyond the targeted delivery (supplementary Table S3). It was found that LNP accumulation in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) activated endothelial cells and neutrophilic inflammation, which might induce both hepatic and systemic toxicity. To address this issue, LNPs were modified with GalNAc ligands to maximize their hepatocyte specificity while reducing uptake by LSECs (Sato et al. 2017). The results showed that systemic administration of GalNAc-LNPs carrying siRNA against hepatitis B virus (HBV) circumvented hepatotoxicity and systemic toxicity in mice with no loss of therapeutic activity in persistent HBV infections (Fig. 5A). To improve the safety profile of LNPs, the \"stealth\" shell of PEG was replaced by a synthetic non-ionic hydrophilic polypeptoid, pSar 23 (polysarcosine) (Nogueira et al. 2020;Wilhelmy et al. 2023). Analysis of in vivo systemic toxicity revealed that pSar-LNPs induced similar or lower liver enzyme levels (e.g., alanine aminotransferase/ALT, aspartate transaminase/AST, lactate dehydrogenase/LDH, and total bilirubin) and reduced cytokine induction compared to their PEG-LNP counterparts (Nogueira et al. 2020). Furthermore, a higher and prolonged erythropoietin (EPO) secretion was observed in mice treated with pSar-LNPs containing DPL14 ionizable lipid (Fig. 5B). Enhanced transfection efficiency and cell-binding affinity to monocytes were also achieved with pSar-LNPs in vitro (Wilhelmy et al. 2023). \n\nIntracellular kinetics of nucleic acid-LNPs can also be affected through the surface engineering.",

            "text": "Although small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are specific silencers for numerous disease-related genes, their clinical applications still require safe and effective means of delivery into target cells. Highly efficient lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are developed for siRNA delivery, showcasing the advantages of novel pH-responsive lipoamino xenopeptide (XP) carriers. These sequence-defined XPs are assembled by branched lysine linkages between cationizable polar succinoyl tetraethylene pentamine (Stp) units and apolar lipoamino fatty acids (LAFs) at various ratios into bundle or U-shape topologies. Formulation of siRNA-LNPs using LAF4-Stp1 XPs as ionizable compounds led to robust cellular uptake, high endosomal escape, and successful in vitro gene silencing activity at an extremely low (150 picogram) siRNA dose. Of significance is the functional in vivo endothelium tropism of siRNA-LNPs with bundle LAF4-Stp1 XP after intravenous injection into mice, demonstrated by superior knockdown of liver sinusoidal endothelial cell (LSEC)-derived factor VIII (FVIII) and moderate silencing of hepatocyte-derived FVII compared to DLin-MC3-DMA-based LNPs. Optimizing lipid composition following click-modification of siRNA-LNPs with ligand c(RGDfK) efficiently silenced vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) in tumor endothelial cells (TECs).

Strategies for generating NPs with such attributes include cell membrane coating, protein modifications, and a nonfouling biomaterials layer. 111 However, these strategies need to be optimized so that there is no deleterious effect on cellular uptake and endosomal escape. 112,113 Another approach for the detargeting of LNPs was recently introduced by Saunders et al. where the authors developed a \"nanoprimer\" that serves as a pretreatment approach to transiently occupy liver cells, thereby facilitating the delivery of LNPs to other tissues. 114",

            "text": "The liver is the primary target of RNA-loaded LNPs because it is estimated that genetic disorders in hepatocytes, parenchymal cells in liver tissue are the cause of thousands of human diseases [31]. The unique structural and functional features in liver tissues enable LNPs to efficiently enter parenchymal cells from the blood stream. The structural features include the presence of small pores, referred to as fenestrae, in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and the absence of basement membranes between hepatocytes and the LSECs. Because it is known that the diameter of the fenestrae are approximately 107 nm and 141 nm in human and mouse, respectively [32], controlling size of LNPs to 100 nm or less in diameter is important in terms of delivering RNAs to hepatocytes [7,[33][34][35]. The functional feature is the presence of the apolipoprotein E/low-density lipoprotein receptor (ApoE/LDLR) mediated the endogenous cellular uptake pathway in hepatocytes. Upon the intravenous administration of LNPs, ApoE proteins are adsorbed on the surface of the LNPs and are recognized by LDLRs, which are expressed at high levels on hepatocytes, resulting in the endocytosis of ApoE-bound LNPs. ApoE proteins are typically found in endogenous lipoproteins, including very low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs), high density lipoproteins, (HDLs), and chylomicrons (CMs), and are involved in promoting the cellular uptake of CMs and VLDLs by hepatocytes to manage lipid metabolism in the body [36,37]. Yan et al. first demonstrated the involvement of ApoE proteins in the elimination of liposomes from the blood stream by hepatocytes in mice [38]. They showed a 3.6-fold faster blood clearance and over a 20-fold higher accumulation in hepatocytes of neutral liposomes in wild-type mice compared to ApoE-deficient mice, which was not observed for negatively-charged liposomes.

S7). \n\nPotent tdTomato fluorescence in LSECs was observed for LNPs with 100 nm in size (1.0% PEG-lipid) that is similar to the diameter of fenestrae. However, the uptake of LNPs by LSECs was decreased correspondingly with the reduction in LNP size (60 nm). It is likely that more LNPs are directed to hepatocytes through fenestrae rather than interacting with LSECs for cellular entry. Again, with higher PEG-lipid content of 3% or more, a poor ApoE association would be the cause of reduced tdTomato fluorescence. These results confirmed the importance of size and PEG-lipid content of LNPs governing their delivery efficacy to hepatocytes and LSECs. Unfortunately, LNPs with 1.0% PEG-lipid content not only showed increased LNP delivery into LSECs but also resulted in potent cellular uptake by hepatocytes. It would be difficult to achieve LSECspecific delivery of RNA by controlling size and PEG-lipid content of LNPs. Therefore, a different strategy was needed.",

            "text": "Current medicinal chemistry, combined with structural biology, has successfully improved the efficacy, pharmacokinetic properties and safety of NASH therapeutics. Some significant challenges that hamper the efficacy of the therapeutics still exist, and they can be addressed by multidisciplinary approaches. First of all, some pathogenic genes regulate NASH progression independent of ligands or their canonical function [117]. Secondly, the conventional pharmacological inhibition of pathogenic proteins elicits the activation of compensatory pathway [192]. These limitation prompts the creation of innovative proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTAC) technology that directly degrades the target protein via proteasome, or lysosome-dependent way [193,194]. PROTAC is potent and specific in vivo at much lower doses than conventional inhibitors and is currently under clinical investigation [195]. Modification of current NASH therapeutics into PROTAC can effectively enhance their efficacy and reduce adverse effects. \n\nAnother common problem in the therapeutics against NASH is the suboptimal liver-specific distribution. Nanoparticles that selectively deliver the therapeutics into liver have been extensively reviewed, as well as the cell subtype specific delivery of therapeutics into liver [196][197][198]. The combination of nanoparticle with drugs that reverse liver sinusoid capillarization is able to increase their efficacy and lower the adverse effects of treating NASH, especially it solves the most challenging problem: anti-fibrosis. For instance, pretreatment of liver cells with soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator, riociguat maintains a relatively normal liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) porosity. Subsequent hepatic stellated cell-specific absorption of the anti-fibrosis agent, JQ1 encapsulated in peptide-nanoparticles effectively resolves fibrosis in murine NASH models [199].",

            "text": "These generally vary in the range from 380 to 780 nm, but in less permeable tumors like the pancreatic adenocarcinoma, fenestration limits the passage to NPs of less than 50 nm [35]. In the liver, the fenestra diameter of about 100 nm limits the penetration of low-dimension nanoparticles, although liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) show higher endocytosis, so that they can be targeted by larger particles. \n\nJi and colleagues developed and compared three different lipid-based particle formulations, loaded with mRNA and characterized by three mean diameters: 90 nm (low LNPs), 300 nm (medium LNPs), and 1150 nm (micro LPs) [36]. Experimental results demonstrated that low LNPs and micro LPs showed higher in vitro transfection efficacy with respect to medium LNPs. In addition, it was demonstrated that low LNPs and micro LPs showed a similar robust immune response and excellent intracellular delivery ability. \n\nIn another study, LNPs loaded with siRNA and subcutaneously administrated resulted in different silencing FVII effects: in detail, LNPs with the lowest (30 nm) and highest (80 nm) dimensions presented lower silencing ability with respect to the intermediate-size LNPs (45 nm). The accumulation in the liver was, however, inversely proportional to the dimensions and, therefore, highest for 30 nm LNPs. These results can be explained by hypothesizing the better delivery of small LNPs to regional lymph nodes. Moreover, it is suggested that 30 nm LNPs can more easily penetrate tumors even if characterized by poor permeability [37]. \n\nIn light of these considerations, the optimal size range for LNPs is considered to be approximately 20-200 nm, as this size enables them to withstand fluid flow (e.g., blood and lymph) while crossing the interstitium and larger particles (>200 nm) accumulate in the liver, spleen, and lung cells, although distribution is influenced by a combination of size, shape, and surface charge effects [35,38].",

            "text": "mall interfering RNAs (siRNA) are double-stranded RNA molecules, 21-23 nucleotides long, which can downregulate the expression of practically any gene. Therapeutics based on siRNA offer the prospect to open up a vast array of novel drug targets for pharmacological inhibition. However, efficient delivery of macromolecular siRNA to the cytosol of target cells is challenging. Diverse delivery strategies have been explored, including viruses 1,2 , lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) 3 , and ligand-conjugated siRNAs 4,5 . \n\nPatisiran, an LNP-formulated siRNA targeting transthyretin (TTR) in the liver, was recently the first siRNA therapeutic to be approved for clinical use. LNPs preferentially target the liver, where the fenestrated endothelium enables extravasation and endocytosis by hepatic cells 6,7 . How siRNA exits the endosome and enters the cytosol, a process referred to as endosomal escape, has long been poorly understood. Lately, progress has been made in the elucidation of lipid-mediated endosomal escape of siRNA. Electron microscopy studies of liver tissues suggested that LNPs mediate siRNA release in the early stages of the endosomal system 8 . In addition, an endogenous family of \u03b2-galactoside-binding lectins-galectins-were shown to respond to endosomal membrane disruption and rapidly relocate to damaged vesicles during lipid-mediated endosomal escape, making detailed characterization of the process possible 9 . Lipids induce release of the siRNA payload in a narrow \"window of opportunity\" during the endosomal maturation process, after formation of early endosomes but before the siRNA reaches mature lysosomes, characterized by the lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) 9 . \n\nEfficient targeting of LNPs to extra-hepatic tissues has turned out to be challenging. To reach tissues without fenestrated endothelium, and in particular tumors, non-particulate siRNA formulations would be advantageous.",

Nevertheless, many of the targeted drug delivery systems do not necessarily be accumulated sufficiently in the intrahepatic target cell-type such as myofibroblasts, because of high non-specific uptake by hepatocytes and Kupffer cells that are mostly active in the uptake of (nano)particulates. In the liver, the drug first enters via blood circulation to sinusoids and then reaches perisinusoidal space, where hepatocytes are located. Hepatocytes, comprises of about 80% of the total resident hepatic cells in healthy liver, are strategic key cells in a wide range of liver diseases and are actively involved in the metabolism of numerous drugs entering the liver. In addition to hepatocytes, Kupffer cells (sinusoidal macrophages) accounts for 15% of total healthy liver cell population and constitutes 80-90% of the tissue-resident macrophages in the whole body. They are active in immune defenses by removing not only dangerous foreign compounds, but also many large molecular-weight drugs entering the liver via circulation [105]. Rapid uptake and complete degradation of many biological compounds by Kupffer cells make them challenging barriers to systemic delivery of therapeutics [106]. Also, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), present close to hepatocytes within the space of Disse, like Kupffer cells have high phagocytic ability which has a fundamental role in immune system and host defense. As already mentioned, HSCs are the important fibrogenic cells of liver, playing major role in liver fibrosis/cirrhosis. However, the drugs that enter the liver will not necessarily reach the intended target cell type. Since HSCs are located in the space of Disse between endothelial cells and hepatocytes, the (targeted) drug-conjugates should pass sinusoidal endothelial barriers, and escape Kupffer cells and hepatocytes uptake to be accumulated selectively in HSCs for therapeutic efficacy [107].",

Further to this, receptor expression varies between individuals and is often altered in diseased states, such as liver fibrosis or hepatocellular carcinoma, making precise targeting even more difficult. 84 When nanoparticles enter the bloodstream, they quickly acquire a protein corona-a layer of adsorbed proteins-that can obscure targeting ligands, reducing specificity and increasing off-target effects. 85,86 High doses of nanoparticles may also saturate receptors, further limiting their ability to appropriately reach target cells.",

Nanoparticles can be internalized through clathrin-mediated or caveolin-mediated endocytosis, macropinocytosis, and other endocytotic mode [188]. Similar as macrophages, LSECs possess phagocytic ability. Using scavenger receptors, mannose receptors, LSECs can directly take up materials from the bloodstream [112].

Hepatic stellate cells distribute within the space of Disse which is a narrow space between LSECs and hepatocytes [22].

            "text": "2][3][4] LNP technology has come a long way, starting with early liposomal drug systems and advancing to sophisticated formulations designed for precise nucleic acid delivery. [7][8][9] One key feature of LNPs is their preferential accumulation in the liver, a phenomenon that has been well exploited for treating liver disease. This liver-specific tropism depends on interactions with serum proteins (e.g., apolipoprotein E [ApoE]) as well as the liver's anatomy and physiology. 10,11 Upon systemic administration, LNPs rapidly bind to ApoE, which facilitates their targeting to hepatocytes via low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor. 12 As an additional driver of LNP accumulation, the liver's participation in the reticuloendothelial system (RES) is fundamental to ApoE-mediated targeting. 10 Kupffer cells, the liver's resident macrophages that filter nanoparticles from the bloodstream, contribute to liver tropism but can also reduce ther-apeutic efficacy by trapping LNPs before they reach hepatocytes. 13 To address this limitation, lipid compositions are optimized to evade macrophage uptake or to maximize delivery to hepatocytes. 14 e role of the RES in LNP biodistribution is exemplified by Wang et al., 15 who demonstrated how hard nanomaterials are sequestered in the liver through interactions with its microarchitecture and specific cellular components. They have shown that liver-resident Kupffer cells, B cells, and endothelial cells are responsible for nanomaterial accumulation, with Kupffer cells having the highest uptake. At the same time, nanomaterials enter the liver sinusoids at a slower flow rate than in systemic circulation, which increases their probability of uptake by these phagocytic cells, such as Kupffer cells. \n\nOnce inside hepatocytes, LNPs enable applications such as gene editing, gene expression, and gene silencing 16 (Figure 1), as previously reported. 17",

            "text": "7][8] Because mutated proteins are produced in specific cells, there is a critical need to develop organ specific delivery strategies to reach the full potential of genomic medicines. Non-viral synthetic nanoparticles represent a safe and efficacious approach that allows repeated administrations. Among carriers, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) represent a broad class of materials that can deliver therapeutic nucleic acids to the liver, 2, 4, 9 including a recently FDA-approved siRNA LNP therapy for transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis called Onpattro. 10 Despite these advances, it is currently impossible to predictably and rationally design nanoparticles for delivery to targeted tissues beyond the liver. \n\nWe report a strategy termed Selective ORgan Targeting (SORT) that allows nanoparticles to be systematically engineered for accurate delivery of diverse cargoes including mRNA, Cas9 mRNA / sgRNA, and Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes to the lungs, spleens, and livers of mice following intravenous (IV) administration (Fig. 1a). Traditional LNPs are composed of ionizable cationic lipids, amphipathic phospholipids, cholesterol, and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) lipids. Here we show that addition of a supplemental component (termed a SORT molecule) precisely alters the in vivo RNA delivery profile and mediates tissue-specific gene delivery and editing as a function of the percentage and biophysical property of the added SORT molecule. In this work, we provide evidences for tissue-specific delivery, establish that this methodology is applicable to various nanoparticle systems, and provide a new method for predictable LNP design to target therapeutically relevant cells. \n\n][13] This exhaustive focus on ionizable cationic lipids has produced highly effective carriers for liver hepatocytes, but has not yielded effective carriers capable of reaching other organs.",

The results showed that intravenous delivery is the most commonly used route, demonstrating its effectiveness in targeting liver cells. Key observations, listed below, show the influence of lipid components, surface chemistry, and target cell interactions. \n\n(1) Ionizable lipids contributed to increased endosomal escape and liver-specific delivery. Lipids, such as MC3 and cKK-E12, had specific pKa values optimized for hepatocyte uptake. 32,67 Importantly, tail length affected organ distribution. For example, shorter tails targeted the spleen, and longer tails favored liver uptake. 67 Formulations such as 5A2-SC8 and 3A5-SC14 showed different targeting behavior; e.g., 5A2-SC8 enhanced ApoEmediated hepatocyte delivery, while 3A5-SC14 favored Kupffer cell uptake. 36 2) Helper lipids, such as DOPE and DSPC, impacted biodistribution. For example, DOPE improved ApoE-mediated liver uptake, while DSPC directed transport to the spleen, showing how fine-tuning LNPs allowed for specific targeting. 23,24 3) Cholesterol stabilizes LNPs and also influences targeting. Esterified cholesterol improved endothelial delivery, while oxidized cholesterol favored Kupffer cells and immune cells, reducing hepatocyte interaction. 68,69 Cationic cholesterol further facilitated delivery to both the liver and extrahepatic tissues, e.g., the lungs and heart. 70 (4) Surface chemistry was important for targeting efficiency. PEG lipids improved circulation, while sheddable variants (e.g., pH-sensitive or enzymatically cleavable PEG) helped target the liver. Mannose-PEG, on the other hand, enhanced receptor-specific delivery to LSECs. 23 pH-sensitive PEGylated lipids increased the stability of the formulation and enabled efficient liver genome editing. 71 Siloxane-incorporated lipidoids also improved endosomal escape and liver-specific mRNA delivery. 72",

            "text": "These latter strategies have been tested in coeliac disease patients, showing initial signs of effectiveness (10,11). Here, we present an optimized clinical-stage nanoparticle-based approach that specifically targets liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). \n\nThe liver is widely recognized for its remarkable ability to tolerize foreign antigens, a necessity considering its constant exposure to antigens from the diet or gut microbiome (12). While various non-parenchymal liver cells (NPLCs) exhibit tolerogenic capacities, LSECs outnumber Kupffer cells by approximately 2.5 times and excel in promoting tolerance even under inflammatory conditions (12). \n\nDelivering disease-relevant peptides to LSECs by an early version of our nanoparticles significantly suppressed autoimmune pathology in relevant animal models (13). For clinical use, we subsequently optimized our particles with a new coating polymer to improve biodegradability and manufacturability. This updated version showed potent tolerizing effects on antigen-specific CD8 + T cells in mice (14). To warrant a broad range of clinical applications, we further refined the formulation and peptide carrier functions of these nanoparticles, now called \"Topas Particle Conjugates\" (TPCs). Here, we present the results of this optimization process using a proprietary linker technology for diverse peptide conjugation, confirming that the updated TPCs preferentially target LSECs and effectively induce peptide-specific T cell tolerance in clinically relevant CD4 + T cell-mediated disease models. Due to their unique physicochemical properties, TPCs provide a versatile platform for delivering diverse antigenic peptides to highly tolerogenic LSECs, leveraging the precision of nanomedicine to induce antigen-specific tolerance in ADs.",

            "text": "ApoE binds to LNP in circulation and facilitates binding to low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) on hepatocytes, allowing the endocytosis of LNP-mRNA to the cell. Thus, most of the currently existing preclinical and clinical RNA protein replacement, as well as rare disease studies, consider liver diseases or utilize the liver as a protein production factory by using classical LNP formulations of smaller diameter (<100 nm) that are naturally accumulating in hepatocytes. That the size of the LNP particle >100 nm may be a limiting factor for hepatocyte targeting, especially in humans, could be inferred from Wisse at al., who measured the sizes of fenestrae [153]. Fenestrae are the pores in liver sinusoids with the size of 107 \u00b1 1.5 nm in humans without liver pathology and with a significantly larger size in rodents: C57BL/6 mice (141 \u00b1 5.4 nm) and Sprague-Dawley rats (161 \u00b1 2.7 nm) [153]. To reach hepatocytes, LNP-mRNA must pass through the fenestrae, thus limiting the size of the LNP-mRNA to about 100 nm for hepatocyte targeting. \n\nThe localization of LNP to other organs typically requires the optimization of LNP or active targeting. The importance of LNP composition optimization in screening carried out by Sago et al. resulted in finding 7C2 and 7C3 LNPs that efficiently target endothelial cells, as previously noted [147]. Using the same screening methodology as Sago et al., Gan et al. recently tested a library of 109 LNPs composed of \"constrained phospholipids\" that contained an adamantylhydrocarbon chain [154]. This study identified a novel LNP that delivers mRNA to Kupffer cells instead of hepatocytes, without targeting ligands [154].",

            "text": "The liver is an important organ that participates in digestion, excretion, detoxification, and immunity. Liver diseases are clinically common and frequently occurring. Some liver diseases, such as viral hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer, greatly endanger hu-man health [90,91]. While many drugs are clinically used to treat liver diseases, most have limited clinical use owing to their poor distribution in the liver, significant toxic side-effects on other organs, and instability within the body. Consequently, there is an ongoing need to explore effective treatments for liver disease. Liver-targeted LNPs can effectively deliver drugs to lesion sites in the liver, reduce systemic distribution, decrease the dosage and frequency of medications, improve the therapeutic index of drugs, and reduce adverse reactions. \n\nThe success of patisiran (Onpattro \u00ae ) demonstrates the potential application of livertargeted LNPs in clinical treatment. This drug achieves efficient therapeutic effects by utilizing the natural uptake of LNPs by the liver and the expression of specific receptors on the surface of liver cells. During patisiran treatment, LNPs bind to apoE, which in turn binds to low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLRs). Given the high expression of LDLRs on the surface of liver cells, this binding mechanism enables LNPs to effectively deliver small interfering RNA (siRNA) to the liver, thereby silencing the expression of abnormal proteins associated with hereditary thyroxine transporter amyloidosis. The therapeutic strategy of using LNPs for liver-targeted delivery has shown significant advantages in treating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), liver fibrosis, and other liver diseases [92]. Xu et al. [60] explored the possibility of delivering epitope mRNA-LNPs by targeting hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), aimed at inhibiting allergic reactions to peanut crude protein extract. To achieve this goal, they developed mannose-modified LNPs that encapsulated mRNA-expressing peanut epitopes designed to enter the liver via biodistribution and be taken up by LSECs, which in turn induced a tolerance effect that effectively inhibited allergic reactions to crude peanut allergen extracts.",

In either case oligonucleotides may represent the active principle. \n\nLack of targeting control is a general challenge when these therapeutics are injected i.v. The main cause of targeting failure is unwanted uptake in liver [1]. Apart from the one noteworthy example of i.v. administered oligonucleotide therapeutics patisiran that successfully targets the major type of liver cells, the hepatocytes (HCs) [2], the general rule is that large molecules/nanoformulations are rapidly cleared from the circulation by specialized scavenger cells lining the wall of the several hundred million capillary-like liver vessels called liver sinusoids. The scavenger cells of the liver sinusoids represent two cell types: the liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and the Kupffer cells (KCs). The KCs are the resident mononuclear phagocytes of the liver and represent by far the largest population of macrophages in the body. These cells are geared to carry out phagocytosis of large blood-borne material (>200 nm). In contrast the LSECs, representing the great majority of endothelial cells of the liver, are unable to perform phagocytosis under normal conditions, but are among the most active endocytic cells of the body, using clathrin-mediated endocytosis and a set of unique endocytosis receptors [3]. \n\nAlthough the LSECs and KCs make up only 3.3% and 2.5% of the total liver volume, the numberwise distribution of same cells is 21% and 8.5% [4].",

[122]LNPs are known for their highly effective RNA delivery to liver hepatocytes.For example, Onpattro, an LNP formulation of siRNA, which was approved by FDA for treating polyneuropathies in 2018, delivers siRNA to hepatocytes with high potency. [123]To translate the clinically approved delivery platform to mRNA-based therapy, Wang et al. used liver-homing MC3 LNPs to selectively deliver mRNA to the liver with a high transfection efficacy while drastically less in other organs. [124]Similarly, Rybakova et al. used liver-targeting LNPs to deliver modified mRNA encoding an anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) antibody, trastuzumab, into the liver which reached the expression of full-size therapeutic antibodies to elicit potent antitumor effect. [125]Apart from targeting hepatocytes, transporting mRNA to liver microenvironmental cells represents an attractive strategy for treating liver cancer.Paunovska et al. formulated LNP with oxidized cholesterol which preferentially delivered mRNA into liver microenvironmental cells (e.g., liver endothelial cells, Kupffer cells), with a five-fold transfection rate than hepatocytes. [126]These liver-targeting mRNA-delivering platforms hold great potential in hepatoma immunotherapy.\n\nGiven that most of the systemically administrated mRNA delivery systems are intended to accumulate in the liver, [58,86c,124,127] transporting mRNA outside the liver is urgently needed for certain extrahepatic diseases, such as extrahepatic cancers. [128]By varying the lipid-to-mRNA weight ratio and subsequently adjusting the surface charges of LNP, Kranz et al. reported a pioneering study for surfacecharge dependent organ tropism of mRNA-LNP, opening the prelude to using LNP to deliver mRNA in vivo.

            "text": "Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) are highly specialised endothelial cells (ECs) lining the sinusoidal capillaries of the liver, where they reside along the space of Disse separating them from hepatocytes. LSECs have five main functions. First, LSEC fenestrations actively regulate the flow of macromolecules, such as lipids and chylomicron remnants towards the hepatocytes 1,2 . Second, LSECs endocytose larger lipid complexes, soluble macromolecules, hyaluronan, and glycosylation end products via the mannose receptor (MR or CD206), CD32B, stabilin-1 (STAB1), and stabilin-2 (STAB2) 3,4 . Third, in response to hepatic injury, LSECs regulate liver regeneration by releasing hepatocyte growth factor, WNT2, and angiopoietin-2 5,6 . Fourth, LSECs can clear a multitude of viruses [7][8][9][10][11][12] . Furthermore, LSECs clear bacterial compounds via the MR, STAB1, and STAB2 receptors. LSECs also express Toll-like receptors, as well as several proteins involved in inflammasome formation (such as NLRP-1, NLRP-3, and AIM2) 13 . Expression of CD32B allows uptake of IgG immunocomplexes, while STAB2 is involved in endocytosis of Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. Finally, LSECs have a major role in adaptive immunity. LSECs are antigen-presenting cells through MR-mediated antigen uptake and expression of MHC-I 14 .\n\nUpon antigen presentation by MHC-I, LSECs can activate CD8+ T cells. In addition, LSECs are the main cells in the liver responsible for the conversion of CD4+ T cells into CD4+ CD25+ Foxp3+ regulatory T cells 15 .\n\nIn pathological conditions, LSECs become dysfunctional and play a role in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and fibrosis [16][17][18][19",

Most strikingly, srLNPs yielded an approximately fivefold and an approximately threefold targeting enhancement to murine LSECs and KCs, respectively (Figure 6d). This confirmed that the incorporation of anionic DSPG into LNP-mRNA delivery systems not only enhanced liver tropism in general but led to a significant shift toward preferential LNP targeting and cellular uptake within hepatic RES cell types.\n\nTo confirm functional mRNA delivery to hepatic RES cells, LNPs entrapping capped mCherry-mRNA (0.25 mg kg \u22121 mRNA) were administered (Figure 6e). This dosage is in line with other systemically administered LNP-mRNA therapies, including those currently in clinical trials (e.g., NCT03829384). [85] Following organ isolation and cell separation at 24 hpi, srLNPs yielded significantly enhanced mRNA delivery to hepatic RES cell types relative to DSPC-LNPs (p < 0.001) (Figure 6f,g). Indeed, DSPC-LNP-mediated mCherry expression in hepatic RES cell types was indiscernible above background. Within hepatocytes, and despite comparatively low targeting efficiency to these cells, both srLNPs and DSPC-LNPs expressed significantly higher amounts of mCherry than in hepatic RES cells (Figure 6f). This apparent disparity between liver-cell-specific targeting and resultant mRNA expression levels can be explained by the very different physiologies and endogenous functions of hepatocytes versus hepatic RES cells. LSECs and KCs have very high endo-/phagocytic capacity (leading to significant mRNA degradation despite high LNP uptake), whereas hepatocytes have exceptionally high translational capacity (leading to significant mRNA expression despite comparably low LNP recognition and uptake).

            "text": "The liver is the major organ for protein synthesis and immune defense. Following intravenous injection, mRNA NPs tend to accumulate in liver, mainly due to its abundant blood supply, low flow velocities, and unique fenestrated type of hepatic sinusoidal endothelium (Fig. 6) [102]. Hepatic sinusoidal endothelium differs from the Fig. 6 Schematic illustration of the structure of the liver and the journey of mRNA NPs to all kinds of cells in the liver via intravenous injection. The passive and active targeting characteristics of hepatocytes, hepatic stellate cells and hepatic endothelial cells are also presented endothelia in other organs, with a fenestrae range of approximately 150 nm but lacking a basement membrane [89]. Consequently, hepatic sinus endothelium can act as an effective \"ultrafiltration system\" or \"sieve, \" allowing small-sized NPs to enter the Disse space where hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are located without restriction, and thereafter deliver mRNA into hepatocytes and HSCs. Conversely, large NPs will be absorbed by Kupffer cells (hepatic macrophages) around the hepatic sinus. This suggests that the size of mRNA NPs is an important factor that affects cellular targeted delivery. Moreover, the adhesion of protein coronas in blood is also a critical factor in the preferential accumulation of mRNA NPs in liver. Despite some progress made in hepatic targeted mRNA delivery through nanocarriers, challenges still exist in successfully delivering mRNA to specific liver cells. Accordingly, this section focuses on the specific cell types in the liver and, based on the LNP and polymer category, provides a comprehensive discussion of the targeting strategies for delivering mRNA to different cell types (Table 1).",

The physiological structure of different tissues varies significantly, which may heavily affect the efficiency of delivering mRNA to the immune cells residing in these tissues. For example, owing to the unique physiological characteristics of the liver, the blood velocity of the liver is reduced up to 1000fold, which increases the interaction between nanoparticles and hepatocytes, hepatic endothelial cells and Kupffer cells, leading to low transfection efficacy of other immune cells, such as DCs and T cells, in other tissues [62]. The blood enters the spleen through the afferent splenic artery, branching into central arterioles surrounded by white pulp, and then the blood leaves the arterioles into the red pulp where the blood flow rate slows down [62,63]. Nanoparticles larger than 200 nm are easily trapped and internalized by macrophages of the red pulp [64]. The blood-brain barrier (BBB), which is composed of highly connected vascular endothelial cells, is also a specific structure that impedes drug delivery into the brain. Current methods to cross the BBB mainly focus on adsorption-and receptor-mediated delivery, such as using cationic nanoparticles to enhance adsorption or ligand-modified nanoparticles to induce receptor-mediated endocytosis to cross the vascular endothelial cells [65].\n\nRecently, Dilliard et al. reported selective organ targeting nanoparticles (SORT nanoparticles) for tissue-specific mRNA delivery and provided a paradigm for optimizing the design of tissue-specific delivery system [66]. They synthesized the tissue-targeting SORT LNPs by formulating the additional fifth component (termed a SORT molecule) into the conventional LNPs, which are composed of four components: ionizable cationic lipids, amphipathic phospholipids, cholesterol, and PEG-lipids. The incorporation of SORT molecules alters the apparent pKa of nanoparticles and further affects the properties of nanoparticles to adsorb plasma proteins. Briefly, the liver-targeting SORT LNPs had an apparent pKa within the 6-7 range,",

            "text": "The ratio values are shown as mean \u00b1 SD. (B) Hierarchy of NP uptake in all types of NP-treated liver. Kupffer cells mainly took up NPs (38%), followed by HSCs (29%) LSECs (29%), and hepatocytes (4%) in hydrophilic-NP-PBS treated liver. LSECs were the primary cells taking up NPs (41%), followed by Kupffer cells (36%), HSCs (21%), and hepatocytes (2%) in hydrophobic-NP-PBS treated liver. The hierarchy of NP uptake in hydrophobic-NP-olive oil treated liver was LSECs (39%) > Kupffer cells (32%) > HSCs (26%) > hepatocytes (3%). \n\nLSECs are highly specialized endothelial cells compared with normal continuous endothelial cells in the vessels [27]. LSECs form a permeable barrier, at the interface between the sinusoidal vessels and the space of Disse [28,29]. Therefore, LSECs were regarded as an important barrier to overcoming NP delivery to HSCs or hepatocytes. NP delivery to HSCs and hepatocytes can be impaired by strong endocytosis of LSECs, as well as phagocytosis of Kupffer cells, as evidenced in a previous literature review [30]. This implies a possible convenience of Kupffer cells and LSECs for targeting by NPs, due to their location and strong phagocytic and endocytic activity [31,32]. Based on our results, hydrophobic NP surface modification would be appropriate for targeting LSECs. \n\nHydrophilic silica NPs seem to be more appropriate to target HSCs rather than LSECs. The number of NP-positive HSCs in the hydrophilic-NP-PBS treated liver was significantly highest among all NP-treated livers (Figure 5B), and so hydrophilic surface-modified NPs might be more likely to reach HSCs when compared with the hydrophobic surface-modified NPs.",

            "text": "Furthermore, the polymer poly(maleic anhydride-alt-1-octadecene) has also been used to coat superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles in order to direct them to the sinusoidal endothelium [272]. Besides that, adenovirus with the endothelial cell specific ROBO4 promoter have been seen to present a high degree of LSEC specificity and have been used to promote liver regeneration while bypassing fibrosis [218]. Finally, quantum dots (QDs), a type of nanoparticles with a size between 1-20 nm that present quantum effects [265] are also an area or interest [265]. Telluride/cadmium sulphide QDs [273] and Zn-labelled CdSelenide/CdS/ZnS QDs have been shown to effectively ameliorate LSEC delivery [274]. However, QDs may produce toxicity as they usually contain cadmium or other toxic elements [274]. \n\nBesides nanoparticle coating, particle size has to be taken into account since nanoparticles bigger than 250 nm are directly taken up by KC for being too big to pass through fenestrae. Contrarily, those with a diameter between 5-20nm particularly target LSEC [265,275]. \n\nFor the moment, LSEC targeting strategies have been employed in the context of cancer, autoimmunity, acute liver damage, ischemia-reperfusion injury and haemophilia [5,262,264,270,272,276], but they represent an attractive treatment also for liver fibrosis. \n\nIn fact, LSEC targeted delivery of drugs would represent an exceptional approach to specifically treat dysfunctional LSEC by selectively modifying their dysregulated pathways.",

            "text": "Although LNPs can be used to efficiently deliver nucleic acids in vivo, their preferential accumulation in the liver tissue poses a significant limitation. Strikingly, as much as 30-90% of systemically administered LNPs accumulate in the liver, which would constitute a severe off-target effect if treating non-hepatic diseases [251,252]. In order to transition mRNA-LNPs from prophylactic to therapeutic applications, researchers must overcome the crucial challenge of delivering mRNA payloads to non-hepatic tissues. Considerable efforts have been devoted to guiding mRNA-LNPs to specific tissues, as selective targeting remains a key obstacle to the advancement of precision medicine and mitigation of off-target and adverse effects associated with RNA-based therapeutics [185,186]. \n\nWhile non-targeting mRNA-LNPs tend to primarily accumulate in the liver after administration via intravenous, intramuscular and subcutaneous routes, targeting ligands may be used to more precisely direct LNPs to hepatocytes or other specific liver cell types. For example, one study utilized LNPs decorated with mannose ligands to deliver mRNA encoding epitope peptides of Arachishypogaea protein 2 (Ara h2), a primary allergen in peanuts, to LSECs [253]. In C3H/HeJ mice sensitized to and subsequently challenged with crude peanut allergen extract, the prophylactic administration of the LSEC-targeted mRNA-LNP could inhibit anaphylaxis. This effect was mediated by suppression of Th2-mediated cytokine production, IgE synthesis and mast cell release of inflammatory factors. In other work, antibodies against the endothelial cell surface marker, PCAM-1 (platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1; CD31) were utilized for LNP targeting [195]. Intravenous administration of anti-PCAM-1-conjugated mRNA-LNPs led to low levels of hepatic uptake accompanied by an approximately 200-fold elevation of mRNA delivery and 25-fold increase of protein expression in the lungs compared to non-targeted counterparts.",

            "text": "Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) are highly specialized endothelial cells that form a permeable barrier between blood and the liver parenchyma.Unlike other endothelial cells, LSECs lack a basement membrane and are fenestrated, which allows macromolecule transport from the blood to hepatocytes.In addition, they display very high endocytosis capacity important for nutrient exchange and clearance of waste products.Under physiological conditions, LSECs regulate and maintain hepatic vascular tone.They have important roles in innate and adaptive immunity to maintain immune tolerance, express toll-like receptors and inflammasome components, are involved in trafficking of leukocytes, and clear microbial antigens and viruses (reviewed in [106]).LSECs also play a major role in liver disease and regeneration [107,108].LSECs contribute to persistence of chronic viral infections.They drive initiation and exacerbation of fibrosis, wherein they undergo capillarization, characterized by loss of fenestrae, acquisition of a basement membrane and endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition.LSEC also secrete angiocrine factors that balance regeneration vs. fibrosis.\n\nDespite the important role of LSECs in liver homeostasis and disease, very few protocols have aimed to create cells with LSEC features from PSCs [103,109,110] (Table 2, Figure 2D), even if multiple methods have been described to create PSC-derived endothelial cells [111,112].Using mouse PSC, Arai et al. already demonstrated in 2011 that cells with LSEC features could be generated from embryoid bodies by the modulation of andrenomedullin-RAMP2 signaling.They showed that co-administration of adrenomedullin and SB431542, a TGF\u03b2 receptor type I inhibitor, resulted in an enhanced differentiation of LYVE1/STAB2 + EC population.These LSEC-like cells showed a robust endocytosis potential, expressed increased levels of F8, Fcgr2b and Mrc1 and possessed fenestrae-like structures [113].",

            "text": "The non-parenchymal cells (NPCs) consist of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), Kupffer cells (KCs) and stellate cells (169). The nutrient-rich blood from the hepatic portal vein and oxygen-rich blood from the hepatic artery meet in the sinusoidal blood vessels (170). During this process, the LSECs of the sinusoidal vessels assist in clearing macromolecular waste and regulating hepatic vascularity (171). Other than most endothelial cells, LSECs possess a higher endocytic ability. As an example, 45% of all pinocytic vesicles are attributed to LSECs and LSECs are shown to be more efficient in absorbing/internalizing circulating antigens than dendritic cells or macrophages of the spleen and Kupffer cells and dendritic cells of the liver (172)(173)(174). LSECs are able to filter the blood via selective exchange of molecules in the blood and underlying stellate and hepatocytes due to their fenestrated morphology (175). Due to the lack of a basement membrane or basal lamina, there is direct access to the space of Disse (perisinusoidal space) for interaction between blood and hepatocyte or stellate cells (176). The LECs fenestrae have the ability to change their diameter according to as a response to the cellular microenvironment (177). The fenestrae are maintained by cooperative paracrine and autocrine signalling of hepatocytes and stellate cells. VEGF, NO and serotonin pathways have been shown to be involved in the maintenance and regulation of contraction or dilation of the fenestrae (178,179). Loss or reduction fenestrae number in LSECs is referred to as defenestration (177). Defenestration leads to reduced hepatic uptake of lipoproteins which can cause hypolipoproteinemia (180). Subsequently, defenestration is involved in multiple disorders like liver fibrosis, atherosclerosis, or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).",

            "text": "The usage of the fast-shedding PEG-lipid allowed more hepatocyte targeting compared with Kupffer cells, the liver macrophages, thus improving the effectivity of LNP-siRNA drug [60]. This study is in agreement with the previous study by Judge et al. where the authors found less formed anti-PEG antibodies and a substantial reduction of side effects upon repetitive dosing in mice when PEGylated liposomes containing a shorter alkyl chain (C14) PEG-lipid versus a longer alkyl chain C16 PEG-lipid were used [151]. Studies directly examining the effects of anti-PEG antibodies on the efficacy and safety of LNP-mRNA drugs containing PEG lipids are still very limited. Recently, Nogueira et al. examined diverse chain lengths and molar fractions of stealth lipid Polysarcosine (PSar) and found efficient mRNA delivery with a lower cytokine pro-inflammatory profile, reduced complement activation, and liver toxicity markers, compared with PEG-containing LNPs [59]. \n\nLocalization to particular tissues and the active targeting of LNP-mRNA therapeutics to specific cell types and organs are a topic of particular interest that can improve current off-target effects and pave a route for novel applications in difficult-to-target tissues. As already discussed, localization to particular tissues can be achieved by optimization on the mRNA level by introducing cell type specific miRNA target sites to 3 UTRs leading to the degradation of the mRNA, leading to the loss of translation efficacy of LNP-mRNA in selected cell types [128]. However, optimization on the level of LNP is the main focus with diverse approaches based on changing LNP structural components and optimizing LNP composition or those actively targeting specific cells using a functionalized surface, for example, with targeting ligands or antibodies. Most of the currently developed LNPs largely localize to the liver through apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-mediated uptake [152]. ApoE binds to LNP in circulation and facilitates binding to low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) on hepatocytes, allowing the endocytosis of LNP-mRNA to the cell.",

            "text": "The FDA approval of ONPATTRO\u00d2, the first RNAi-based drug, has forged the pathway for next generation RNA-based therapeutics reaching the clinic. 3 It was enabled by the development of lipidbased nanoparticles (LNPs) that are used to deliver siRNA to hepatocytes preferentially. 2 This technology has received wide interest and is being deployed to deliver larger nucleic acids, such as messenger RNA and genome-editing components. 35,51 LNP-mediated intracellular delivery of nucleic acids occurs through its interactions with serum proteins, specifically apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which assists their cellular entry to hepatocytes via receptor-mediated endocytosis. 2,31 While LNPs enter hepatocytes in a highly efficient manner, effective cytosolic delivery of nucleic acids remains challenging. In particular, it has been consistently shown that most LNPs are sequestered and degraded in lysosomes 12 or removed to extracellular space, 44 significantly limiting their therapeutic effects. 19,34 In addition, it is difficult to target nonhepatic organs with LNPs due to high liver tropism. It was demonstrated that spleen 21,25 and lung endothelium 28,29 can be targeted by modification of LNP formulations. Nonetheless, the use of LNPs with regards to non-hepatic delivery is still limited, and is the area of focus for next generation therapeutics.\n\nTypically, LNPs consist of four lipids: (1) cationic lipid, (2) PEG lipid, (3) cholesterol, and (4) structural lipid. The first component i.e. the cationic lipid is generally composed of a cationic head group and lipid tails, and is located in the core of LNPs with nucleic acids. This component is extensively explored because of its ability to assemble negatively charged nucleic acids into particles via electrostatic forces, and also in causing cytosolic release of nucleic acid by its interactions with the endosomal membrane. 1,10,16,45 The second component is the PEG lipid which possesses a PEG chain anchored to a lipid headgroup. This molecule prevents aggregation and provides stability by causing ste",

As passive targeting with lipid nanoparticle is a vast subject in itself, in this review we will discuss the types of lipids to use, as well a their proportions, in order to deliver gene therapies to specific organs, especiall extrahepatic ones. By manipulating the composition of lipids (Figure 2) and their proportion in LNPs, it is possible to change their size and surface characteristics. Indeed, the size and charge of LNPs seem to have significant effects on their biodistribution. Therefore, the delivery of the LNPs can be more specific to certain organs. Unfortunately, we still do not clearly understand the precise mechanism that explains the relationship between the biodistribution of LNPs and their size, charge, and the types of lipids used. It would therefore be interesting to conduct fundamental research on this mechanism.

Nonetheless, minimal alteration of chemical structures of vectors in the same class might also achieve the goal of targeting, and the research on exploring targeted material structures is in full swing. Beyond Dlin-MC3-DMA, ALC-0315, and SM-102 approved by FDA for clinical use in LNP formulations, numerous advancements have been made in the development of various lipids, lipidoids, and polymers for delivering RNA to targeted organs. Here, we outline the relationship between the chemical structures of these materials and their specific targeting capabilities for different organs (Figure 2). 3D, and identified the top-performing lipid, cKK-E12, via iterative screening and structure-activity relationships (SAR) study. As a result, cKK-E12 LNPs delivered siRNA to liver and silenced Phosphatase and tensin homolog (Pten) in hepatocytes with high selectivity (Figure 3E) [107]. Furthermore, cKK-E12 LNPs were also utilized to co-deliver Cas9 mRNA and sgRNA for editing PCSK9 in hepatocytes of mice in a subsequent study [103]. \n\nSimilarly, Whitehead and colleagues synthesized a series of lipidoids by Michael Addition for siRNA delivery. And subsequent investigation revealed that the lead 306Oi10 LNPs resulted in much higher siRNA accumulation in liver than naked siRNA [108]. \n\nCurrently, LNPs have been increasingly employed for loading mRNA to achieve liver targeting, and applications such as gene editing and protein replacement are explored [109,110]. The mechanism underlying the liver-targeting of LNPs has been extensively studied and several findings are publicized. Upon entry into the body, LNPs can interact with proteins in the biological environment and adsorb proteins on the membrane surface to form the protein corona [55,111].",

            "text": "The liver is the primary organ of LNP accumulation following intravenous admin istration and is also observed to varying degrees following intramuscular and subcutane ous routes, with larger LNP having less liver uptake [26]. For example, after intramuscular administration of an mRNA LNP vaccine to mice, branched DNA analysis of tissue mRNA identified muscle > lymph node > liver > spleen > testis as the primary organs o LNP accumulation in descending order [27]. Interestingly, mRNA LNP uptake does no necessarily correlate with mRNA protein expression [26]. The cell populations involved in liver uptake are dependent upon the underlying uptake mechanism. A common mech anism of uptake for most nanoparticles, including LNP, is scavenger receptor-mediated uptake into the hepatic Kupffer cells and sinusoidal endothelium following opsonization by non-specific absorption of plasma proteins [28]. Alternatively, Akinc et al. discovered that adsorption of endogenous apolipoprotein E (ApoE) can direct the uptake of LNP to hepatocytes through interaction with the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) located in these cells [29]. These researchers characterized this uptake mechanism by using LDLR knockout mice and hepatocytes in vitro and went on to show that the N-acetylgalactosa mine (GalNAc) ligand covalently attached to LNP could also target hepatocytes through the asialoglycoprotein receptor (Table 1). The utility of GalNAc-mediated hepatocyte tar geting of LNP is demonstrated by the recent approval of Onpattro transthyretin siRNA for hereditary amyloidosis mentioned above. Clearly, delivery of nucleic acid to hepato cytes by LNP has therapeutic potential, but there are many disease indications that would benefit from non-hepatic LNP tissue and cell population targeting, such as cancer and neurological and cardiovascular disease.",

            "text": "To achieve this goal, they developed mannose-modified LNPs that encapsulated mRNA-expressing peanut epitopes designed to enter the liver via biodistribution and be taken up by LSECs, which in turn induced a tolerance effect that effectively inhibited allergic reactions to crude peanut allergen extracts. This tolerance effect was accompanied by the inhibition of the Th2 immune response, IgE antibody production, and degranulation of mast cells. Kim et al. [93] reported the development of engineered LNPs for the targeted delivery of mRNA to hepatocytes and LSECs. They evaluated the effects of the particle size and PEG-lipid content of LNPs on the specific delivery of mRNA in the liver. Targeted mRNA delivery to the LSECs was further explored by introducing active ligands. Interestingly, Saunders et al. [94] utilized the dimensions of fenestrations in the liver and administered nanoprimers to mice as a pretreatment. This strategy aimed to reduce LNP uptake, consequently enhancing LNP accumulation in cell types other than Kupffer cells and LSECs. \n\nLiver-targeted LNPs show potential for the treatment of hereditary diseases such as hemophilia and acute intermittent porphyria [95]. Studies have identified antithrombin (AT) as a negative regulatory factor that can be targeted to treat hemophilia A and B [96,97]. Restoration of the coagulation system balance has been achieved using the RNA interference drug fitusiran to selectively inhibit AT [98]. However, it is not a long-acting medication and requires repeated injections [99]. To seek long-acting treatments for hemophilia, Han et al. [69] developed LNPs encapsulating Cas9 mRNA and mouse AT-targeted singleguide RNA (sgRNA) for AT gene editing and inhibition. They evaluated therapeutic efficacy in hemophilia A and B mouse models by assessing thrombin generation mediated by mAT gene editing.",

The authors believe that the next successful use of mRNA vaccines is to be expected because LNPs are widely used in nucleic acid delivery research and clinical applications, and nearly 80 kinds of nucleic acid drugs based on LNPs have entered the clinical stage. 30 Although some clinical data are still available after approval and emergency use authorization (EUA) are obtained from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), LNPs still have many problems that cannot be bypassed. There are several obstacles inside and outside the cells that prevent the application of mRNA LNPs within a wide range. Liver enrichment is a common phenomenon in the mouths of LNP patients. LNPs require some effort to pass through the liver system, and nanoparticles must first be isolated from Kupffer cells (which are macrophages resident in the liver). Kupffer cells in the liver can absorb LNPs of different sizes. In addition, LNPs also interact with hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) to prevent LNPs from passing through the liver system (Figure 2). 31 A total of 30\u221290% of these drugs are concentrated in the liver, which leads to drug deviation during nonliver-targeted administration, 32 thus affecting the therapeu-tic efficacy.",

The binding of anionic helper phospholipid on srLNPs to the scavenger receptor stabilin1/2 (stab1/2) on LSECs improved the LSECs-targeting ability. Furthermore, the anionic phospholipid would inhibit the binding of Apo-E on Onpattro to LDL-r on hepatocytes, which redirected the targeting from hepatocytes to LSECs.

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNP) have emerged as an effective nonviral delivery system for nucleic acid payloads due to their high encapsulation efficiency, low toxicity, ability to facilitate intracellular delivery, and the possibility to modulate their size and surface properties (1)(2)(3). The technological advances carried out in the past three decades have enabled the clinical approval of the first LNP-based siRNA therapeutic, Onpattro (4)(5)(6), which quickly became a landmark formulation that paved the way for the widespread use of LNP as nucleic acid delivery systems (2,7,8) and for the worldwide rollout of the LNP-based vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 (9). However, like many other nanomedicines, LNP suffer from a low selectivity and specificity for target cells and organs and limits clinical translation (10,11). First of all, nanoparticles can be rapidly sequestered by macrophages into the liver and other secondary lymphoid organs, which impair their delivery to target tissues (12). Moreover, while ligand-targeted nanomedicines show a higher efficacy in vitro compared to their untargeted counterpart, this advantage is often lost in vivo due to masking from the formation of a biomolecular protein corona (BMC) (13). The formation of a BMC can be an advantage as several groups have shown that once i.v. administered, the BMC could enable LNPs to possess extrinsic targeting properties, directing them towards specific cell receptors (14-18). An early example of this includes Onpattro, as its ability to interact with specific serum proteins (Apolipoprotein E) after i.v. administrations, directs the LNP towards low-density lipoprotein receptors on the surface of hepatocytes (5,6,19). More recently, studies have focused on extrahepatic delivery by optimizing the physiochemical properties of LNPs to drive distinct BMC profiles, subsequently, enabling targeting of nonliver organs such as the spleen or lungs (20)(21)(22).",

            "text": "For therapeutic nanomaterials, tissue-targeted delivery systems can significantly reduce toxicity and improve bioavailability. Currently, liver-targeted delivery systems are commonly used for the treatment of NAFLD and chronic HBV infection. 36 The absence of a basement membrane and the presence of fenestrations in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) provide the physiological basis for the passive accumulation of nanomaterials in the liver. Besides, the mononuclear phagocyte system, including Kupffer cells, monocytes, and splenic macrophages, helps sequester the majority of nanomaterials in the liver. 37 hagocytosis by the mononuclear phagocyte system is influenced by the route of administration and the properties of nanomaterials, such as size, shape, charge, and rigidity. Nanomaterials ranging from 50 to 250 nm in size, with nonspherical shapes, high charge density, and surface hydrophobicity, are more likely to be captured by the hepatic mononuclear phagocyte system upon entering the bloodstream, thereby facilitating hepatic accumulation. 37,38 This effect may result from opsonization, in which opsonins bind to the nanomaterials, enhancing their recognition and uptake by macrophages. 38 dditionally, albumin-based formulations target the liver by leveraging the transcytosis of albumin through LSECs, facilitating precise delivery to the space of Disse. 39 Moreover, long half-life, high stability, and capacity to bind hydrophobic molecules enhance albumin's accumulation, making it an effective drug delivery vehicle for liver diseases. 40 everal characteristics of the liver can be utilized for active liver-targeted strategies: 36 (1) The larger pore size of LSECs compared to capillary walls in most tissues: Macromolecules can enter liver tissue and accumulate. For instance, the accumulation of dextran in the liver is tissue-dependent based on molecular weight.",

            "text": "Although reducing hepatic uptake of parenterally administered LNP has been a challenge, alterations in LNP composition and physicochemical characteristics have been shown to influence liver distribution (Table 1). The LNP surface charge has been shown to influence the liver accumulation of intramuscularly administered LNP, with negatively charged LNP having greater liver uptake [4]. Similarly, the inclusion of neutral lipids to LNP resulted in liver tropism following intravenous injection, while the addition of cationic lipids to net neutral LNP resulted in a shift to lung uptake and the addition of negatively charged lipids to net neutral LNP resulted in splenic uptake [17]. The addition of oxidized cholesterol to LNP shifted liver uptake away from hepatocytes and into the hepatic microenvironment, including Kupffer cells and hepatic endothelial cells [30]. The inclusion of constrained lipids in LNP, such as adamantyl phospholipids, has also been shown to target hepatic Kupffer cells [31]. Apart from charge and composition, size can also influence hepatocyte transfection, presumably due to the hepatic architecture, with narrow sinusoidal fenestration pores of ~100 nm [32]; LNP > ~200 nm dramatically diminishes hepatocyte transfection [33]. \n\nAlternatives to LNP modification have also been attempted to prevent liver accumulation. In one example, a liposome termed a \"nanoprimer\" was used to saturate Kupffer cell-mediated clearance 10 min prior to administration of LNP containing Cy5.5 labeled human erythropoietin mRNA or factor VII siRNA, resulting in increased systemic fluorescence at 1 h post-dose and increased erythropoietin or decreased factor VII protein expression at 48 h post-dose, respectively [34]. Clever mRNA modifications have also been made in an attempt to reduce off-target liver expression by the design of hepatic-selective, suppressive micro-RNA (miRNA) binding sites into the untranslated regions of the mRNA [35].",

            "text": "Apart from the above-mentioned methods, the use of quantum dot (QD) nanoparticles (1-20 nm) for the treatment of NAFLD has also emerged as an area of great interest [193]. An intravenous injection of mercaptosuccinic acid (MSA)-capped cadmium telluride/cadmium sulfide (CdTe/CdS/QDs) showed that negatively charged QDs were selectively taken up by sinusoidal cells (KCs and LSECs) in rat liver, indicating that CdTe/CdS/QDs can be used for drug delivery to the LSECs [194]. Furthermore, Zn-labelled CdSelenide/CdS/ZnS QDs were also found in the KCs and LSECs 2h after an intravenous injection of polymer-coated Qdots, indicating their efficiency in drug delivery to the sinusoidal cells [195]. In addition, via the usage of nanoparticles carrying honokiol or adenovirus with the endothelial-cell-specific arginylglycylaspartic acid-roundabout guidance receptor 4 (RGD-ROBO4), ERK1/2 activation was promoted, leading to induced liver regeneration and reduced hepatic fibrosis due to high degree of LSEC specificity [196]. \n\nThe main studies targeting endothelial dysfunction in animal models of NAFLD/NASH/cirrhosis are summarized in Table 1. muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) expression [190]. Moreover, lipid NPs carrying procollagen \u03b1 I(I) siRNA remarkably reduced the total hepatic collagen content, leading to an alleviation of NASH progression and accelerating the regression of hepatic fibrosis in CCL4-induced NASH in Balb/c mice [191]. In another attempt, CXCR4-targeted lipid-based NPs carrying VEGF siRNA were used for the treatment of liver fibrosis and hepatic cellular carcinoma; a combination therapy using both AMD-NPs (CXCR4 inhibitor) and VEGF siRNA abolished the infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages and reduced HCC tumor growth [192].",

            "text": "Notably, sinusoid capillarization occurs when LSECs are injured during liver injury, especially chronic liver injury and liver fibrosis. The capillarization process leads to loss of fenestrae and development of a basement membrane, which impedes the entry of nanoparticles through fenestrae to some extent [31]. Antioxidant and anti-inflammatory molecules are reported to prevent and alleviate sinusoid capillarization through protecting LSECs as potential therapeutic options to relieve chronic liver disease and its complications [151,152]. In the articles collected, cerium oxide nanoparticles are demonstrated to reduce portal hypertension, a kind of chronic liver disease complication promoted by sinusoid capillarization, and accumulate in liver parenchyma [153]. Therefore, the nanoparticles with RONS scavenging and anti-inflammatory effects could reach hepatocytes through alleviating ameliorating loss of fenestrae as one important aspect. But a further investigation is necessary to support the underlying mechanism. \n\nUsing the above pathways for transport into hepatocytes, nanodrugs significantly improve the bioavailability of drugs, prolong their therapeutic effects, and achieve combination or targeted therapy. For example, lipidized somatostatin analogue can integrate with the hepatocyte membrane to a greater extent, which promotes accumulation of drugs in the liver (by 3.8 times) [154]. The significant success of ONPATTRO, the first liver-targeted lipid nanodrug approved by the FDA, substantiates the potential application value of nanodrugs in the future [155].",

            "text": "Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), which comprise \u223c50% of liver non-parenchymal cells, are highly specialized endothelial cells containing many small pores or fenestrations, which provide open channels that facilitate the transfer of substrates between the blood and the liver parenchyma and regulate lipoprotein traffic to and from the hepatocytes (379,380). Their unique morphology gives to LSECs a high endocytic capacity, enabling them to act as effective scavengers and promote the clearance of lipids and macromolecules and small particulates from the blood. The impairment of their function is associated with the development of extra-hepatic pathologies, including atherosclerosis (380). LSECs exert a key role in the innate and adaptive immunity, promoting the presentation of antigens and favoring the removal and clearance of circulating antigens and viruses (381). In addition to their roles as pathogen recognition and antigenpresenting cells, LSECs also have a critical role in the recruitment of leukocytes into liver tissue, thus influencing the composition of hepatic immune population. The balance between tolerance and effector immune responses driven by LSECs might promote the resolution or the progression of the immune response, eventually leading to several chronic liver diseases, including NAFLD, cirrhosis, fibrosis, liver failure and HCC (381,382). \n\nIn LSECs, estrogens, even by modulating the levels and the nuclear occupancy of ER (372), enhance the production of nitric oxide (NO) and regulate the hepatic sinusoidal microcirculation (383,384), likely explaining the higher incidence of liver cirrhosis with portal hypertension in men and post-menopausal women than pre-menopausal women (385).",

            "text": "particular, we discovered for the first time that NG2/BMMSCs exhibit unique characteristics that differ from those of parental BMMSCs in terms of producing liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) to reconstruct injured blood vessels and sinusoidal structures in the diseased livers, which are important for initiating hepatocyte regeneration. This unique potential may also suggest that NG2/BMMSCs could be an novel off-liver progenitor of LSECs. Ex vivo studies revealed that the NG2/BMMSCs exhibited a similar trend to that of their in vivo in terms of functional differentiation responding to the DEN-diseased injured liver cues. Additionally, the obvious core role of NG2/BMMSCs in supporting the functions of BMMSCs in bile duct repair and BDC-mediated hepatocyte regeneration might also be a novel finding. Conclusions Overall, the PPWP-isolated NG2/BMMSCs could be a novel effective cell subset with increased purity to serve as a new therapeutic tool for enhancing treatment efficacy of BMMSCs and special seed cell source (BDCs, LSECs) also for bioliver engineering.

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have emerged as a viable, clinically-validated platform for the delivery of mRNA therapeutics. LNPs have been utilized as mRNA delivery systems for applications including vaccines, gene therapy, and cancer immunotherapy. However, LNPs, which are typically composed of ionizable lipids, cholesterol, helper lipids, and lipid-anchored polyethylene glycol, often traffic to the liver which limits the therapeutic potential of the platform. Several approaches have been proposed to resolve this tropism such as post-synthesis surface modification or the addition of synthetic cationic lipids. Methods: Here, we present a strategy for achieving extrahepatic delivery of mRNA involving the incorporation of bile acids, a naturally-occurring class of cholesterol analogs, during LNP synthesis. We synthesized a series of bile acid-containing C14-4 LNPs by replacing cholesterol with bile acids (cholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid, deoxycholic acid, or lithocholic acid) at various ratios. Results: Bile acid-containing LNPs (BA-LNPs) were able to reduce delivery to liver cells in vitro and improve delivery in a variety of other cell types, including T cells, B cells, and epithelial cells. Our subsequent in vivo screening of selected LNP candidates injected intraperitoneally or intravenously identified a highly spleen tropic BA-LNP: CA-100, a four-component LNP containing cholic acid and no cholesterol. These screens also identified BA-LNP candidates demonstrating promise for other mRNA therapeutic applications such as for gastrointestinal or immune cell delivery. We further found that the substitution of cholic acid for cholesterol in an LNP formulation utilizing a different ionizable lipid, C12-200, also shifted mRNA delivery from the liver to the spleen, suggesting that this cholic acid replacement strategy may be generalizable. Conclusion: These results demonstrate the potential of a four-component BA-LNP formulation, CA-100, for extrahepatic mRNA delivery that could potentially be utilized for a range of therapeutic and vaccine applications.",

Most LNPs are prone to target liver and usually be utilized to treat liver diseases. For instance, Onpattro with DLin-MC3-DMA LNP as the vector, is administrated intravenously and enables the inhibition of hepatic production of transthyretin [63]. Yang et al. demonstrated that LNPs encapsulating HNF4A mRNA could attenuate liver fibrosis in preclinical mouse model [64]. Finn et al. used a degradable lipid to formulate LNPs to deliver Cas9 mRNA/sgRNA for gene editing in vivo. The results showed that the editing efficiency was highly considerable for transthyretin gene editing in the liver, reducing serum protein levels by over 97% with a single dose [65]. Recently, some studies have revealed the rules of LNP targeting different liver cell subsets. It is reported that altering surface charge on the LNP in Onpattro formulation from neutral to anionic, the vector was prone to deliver mRNA to the hepatic reticuloendothelial system [66]. Additionally, researchers discovered that altering the size, adjusting PEG-lipid content, or incorporating ligands in LNPs affected the distribution of loaded cargoes in hepatocytes and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), or increased the delivery efficiency in extrahepatic organ. For instance, LNPs with 100 nm diameter in size are the most effective for targeting LSECs, while LNPs with smaller diameters, such as 60 nm, showed tropism for hepatocytes [67].",

It is a critical pre-stage condition of severe hepatopathy, characterized by excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix components and ongoing chronic inflammation. To date, early prevention of liver fibrosis remains challenging. As the most abundant non-parenchymal hepatic cell population, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) are stabilizers that maintain the intrahepatic environment. Notably, LSECs dysfunction appears to be implicated in the progression of liver fibrosis via numerous mechanisms. Following sustained liver injury, they lose their fenestrae (cytoplasmic pores) and change their crosstalk with other cellular interactions in the hepatic blood environment. LSEC-targeted therapy has shown promising effects on fibrosis resolution, opening up new opportunities for anti-fibrotic therapy. In light of this, the present study summarized changes in LSECs during liver fibrosis and their interactions with hepatic milieu, as well as possible therapeutic approaches that specially target LSECs.",

When loaded with RNA, LNPs not only protect their payload from degradation but are also capable of delivering it to cells and facilitate their intracellular entry (Whitehead et al., 2009). When injected intramuscularly or intravenously, LNPs deliver most of their payload to the liver where a dose as low as 2.5 mg/kg can effectively suppress hepatocyte gene expression for as long as 11 days after a single injection (Zimmermann et al., 2006). \n\nWhile to date all clinically approved LNP-base therapies target the liver (Love et al., 2010), there is an urgent need to develop LNP formulations that allow payload delivery to non-hepatic organs and tissues.

            "text": "The accumulation of any type of NPs in the liver is generally accomplished because of the central role of the liver itself as a main metabolic and excretory organ in the body. The presence of fenestrations in the layers of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and the absence of the impermeable basal lamina allow for rapid accumulation of NPs in the liver through passive targeting [24]. Complementing certain anatomic or pathophysiological features of the target organ, such passive accumulation also relies on nanoparticle properties including size, shape, surface charge, and hydrophilicity [25]. For instance, the passive liver targeting strategy highly depends on the size of nanocarriers as the endothelial fenestrations of liver sinusoids span approximately 50-200 nm in diameter (Figure 2a). In their study, Hirn and co-workers revealed that 50% of small gold NPs (around 1.4 nm) were accumulated in the liver after systemic administration. As the size was increased into 200 nm, the fraction of gold NPs accumulated in the liver was further increased to 99% [26]. The fact that around 80-90% of all macrophage population resides in the liver also contributes to the passive accumulation of NPs in the liver [27,28]. \n\nThe interaction of the nanocarriers with various types of cells is size-dependent [30]. Nanocarriers with a particle size bigger than 100 nm could be taken up by LSECs and Kupffer cells through endocytosis. With the increase of particle size, the uptake of nanocarriers by Kupffer cells is enhanced, leading to rapid accumulation of the nanocarriers in the liver with short blood circulation time [31]. In contrast, nanocarriers with a particle size smaller than 100 nm could avoid a capture by Kupffer cells. These nanocarriers then diffuse out of the sinusoids through the dynamic endothelial fenestrations to reach HSCs in the perisinusoidal space or even hepatocytes [24,29]. Smaller nanocarriers (10-20 nm) can be taken up rapidly by hepatocytes [32].",

Many structural and functional features have been elucidated by Braet and Wisse [54,[63][64][65][66][67]. LSECs line the hepatic sinusoids and form pores, so-called fenestrations, that are clustered in sieve plates (Fig. 2). Endothelial fenestrae range from 50 to 200 nm in diameter and differ between species (Table 1). Therefore, liver fenestrae physically restrict circulating LNPs' access to the perisinusoidal space and thus limit cellular interactions with hepatocytes according to size. Several research groups have investigated using pore-opening substances to modulate fenestrae size with limited success [64]. In addition to their structural characteristics, LSECs have high endocytic activity. A number of scavenger receptors, including stabilin-2, can efficiently sequester anionic nanoparticles [68].",

            "text": "Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) line the low shear, sinusoidal capillary channels of the liver and are the most abundant non-parenchymal hepatic cell population. LSECs do not simply form a barrier within the hepatic sinusoids but have vital physiological and immunological functions, including filtration, endocytosis, antigen presentation and leukocyte recruitment. Reflecting these multifunctional properties, LSECs display unique structural and phenotypic features that differentiate them from the capillary endothelium present within other organs. It is now clear that LSECs have a critical role in maintaining immune homeostasis within the liver and in mediating the immune response during acute and chronic liver injury. In this Review, we outline how LSECs influence the immune microenvironment within the liver and discuss their contribution to immune-mediated liver diseases and the complications of fibrosis and carcinogenesis.Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) represent the most abundant non-parenchymal hepatic cell population. In this Review, the authors explore the key roles that LSECs have in regulating hepatic immunity and their contribution to immune-mediated disease, liver fibrosis and carcinogenesis.Key pointsLiver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) that line the hepatic sinusoids have important physiological roles and mediate the filtration and scavenger functions of the liver.LSECs also have innate and adaptive immunological functions, including antigen presentation and maintenance of the balance between tolerance and effector immune responses.In inflammatory liver diseases, LSECs influence the composition of hepatic immune populations by mediating diapedesis of leukocyte subsets via distinct combinations of adhesion molecules and chemokines.LSECs play a crucial part in the cellular crosstalk that regulates progressive chronic liver disease, which leads to fibrosis and carcinogenesis.The role of LSECs in initiating immune responses and contributing to progressive liver disease makes them a potential therapeutic target for treating inflammatory liver diseases.",

Introduction Lipid nanoparticles (LNP) are invaluable carriers for drug and gene delivery, and they are classified as cationic, neutral and anionic depending on the electronic charges exist\u2010 ing on the surface of the vesicles [1]. These charges are originated from the charged lip\u2010 ids from which lipid nanoparticles are formulated. Cationic LNP are commonly used for DNA or RNA carriers due to their interaction with negatively-charged nucleotide. Both neutral and negatively-charged LNPs are used for drug delivery [2] and may be formu\u2010 lated as sterically stable LNPs (SSLNPs), which are amendable for cell type-specific or tissue-specific targeting delivery [3]. For liver drug delivery, tremendous efforts have been made to develop cell type-selective lipid-based drug carriers. Effective approaches in targeting hepatocytes, Kupffer cells and hepatic stellate cells have been evaluated in small animals [3, 4], and some of them may be translational to clinical application [5]. These approaches are referable when cationic LNPs are considered for cell type-selective gene delivery. A prerequisite for the success of gene therapy for liver disorders is the de\u2010 velopment of powerful gene carriers. Non-viral vectors have been very successful for gene transfer in an in vitro setting, in terms of efficiency of lipofection, applicability in variety of cell types, and amending ability of cell type-specific delivery (Fig. 1). The clini\u2010 cal application of LNP-mediated gene transfer has been hampered by low efficiency, in\u2010 stability in the bloodstream, short-term transgene expression and toxicity. These shortcomings are the bottle neck hindering the gene transfer employing LNPs as carriers for delivery of function gene(s) to solid organs, and are the challenges in moving from small to large animals of potential gene carriers and approaches, and in",

            "text": "The liver is the primary organ of LNP accumulation following intravenous administration and is also observed to varying degrees following intramuscular and subcutaneous routes, with larger LNP having less liver uptake [26]. For example, after intramuscular administration of an mRNA LNP vaccine to mice, branched DNA analysis of tissue mRNA identified muscle > lymph node > liver > spleen > testis as the primary organs of LNP accumulation in descending order [27]. Interestingly, mRNA LNP uptake does not necessarily correlate with mRNA protein expression [26]. The cell populations involved in liver uptake are dependent upon the underlying uptake mechanism. A common mechanism of uptake for most nanoparticles, including LNP, is scavenger receptor-mediated uptake into the hepatic Kupffer cells and sinusoidal endothelium following opsonization by non-specific absorption of plasma proteins [28]. Alternatively, Akinc et al. discovered that adsorption of endogenous apolipoprotein E (ApoE) can direct the uptake of LNP to hepatocytes through interaction with the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) located in these cells [29]. These researchers characterized this uptake mechanism by using LDLR knockout mice and hepatocytes in vitro and went on to show that the N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) ligand covalently attached to LNP could also target hepatocytes through the asialoglycoprotein receptor (Table 1). The utility of GalNAc-mediated hepatocyte targeting of LNP is demonstrated by the recent approval of Onpattro transthyretin siRNA for hereditary amyloidosis mentioned above. Clearly, delivery of nucleic acid to hepatocytes by LNP has therapeutic potential, but there are many disease indications that would benefit from non-hepatic LNP tissue and cell population targeting, such as cancer and neurological and cardiovascular disease. \n\nAlthough reducing hepatic uptake of parenterally administered LNP has been a challenge, alterations in LNP composition and physicochemical characteristics have been shown to influence liver distribution (Table 1).",

Therefore, a proposed <100 nm diameter has been suggested [24,113]. Hepatocyte-targeting has also been achieved with nanoparticle coating and compositions. Cholesterol-TWEEN 80 unilamellar vesicles and lipopeptide cKK-E12 showed preferential uptake by hepatocytes over sinusoidal cells while cKK-E12 lipoprotein NPs displayed gene silencing selectivity in hepatocytes over nonliver organs, liver endothelial cells, and liver leukocytes [113,114]. Hepatocyte-specific ligands have also been difficult to identify (Figure 4D). The most popularly implemented is the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) due to its primary expression on hepatocytes, at ~1.8 million receptors/cell, and minimal expression on extrahepatic cells [14]. With a high affinity for N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), galactose (Gal), and glucose, ASGPR has been tested for targeting with these and modified versions of these ligands, such as asialofetuin-PEG residue and galactosylated chitosan [115][116][117]. However, because Kupffer cells also demonstrate Gal/GalNAc scavenging, they could divert nanoparticles intended for hepatocytes [14]. Although less specific, glycyrrhizin/glycyrrhetinic acid receptors found on hepatocyte membranes, as well as kidney, stomach, and colon cells have also been targeted [118]. Glycyrrhizin-modified chitosan NPs, for example, have shown preferential endocytosis by hepatocytes over hepatic non-parenchymal cells [119].",

A recently developed polylipoic acid PNP by Castellani et al. termed F127@PLA-NP was shown to preferentially accumulate in the myocardium when delivered intravenously in mice due to passive targeting. 149 Interestingly, the antioxidant properties of the lipoic acid were demonstrated to exhibit cardioprotection against post-ischemia reperfusion in vitro. Despite these findings, the authors were unable to elucidate the underlying mechanism resulting in the myocardial accumulation. \n\nWhile the search for active targeting strategies starts with a hypothetical modification that enhances targeting due to known interactions with cell types of interest, passive targeting strategies are better uncovered by systematically testing various modifications and molar ratios. Cheng et al. developed the novel strategy of selective organ targeting (SORT) LNPs, which were traditional LNPs modified with an additional supplemental component, termed SORT lipid (cationic, anionic, or uncharged). 150 By systematically testing various modifications of the SORT LNP components including the SORT lipid, they demonstrated tissue-specific targeting of the lung, spleen, or liver when injected intravenously. Similarly, Ni et al. systematically showed that utilizing specific types of piperazine-derived lipids, in combination with specific molar ratios for the individual components of LNPs, can deliver cargo preferentially to non-hepatocytes in vivo, most notably to liver and spleen immune cells at low dosage (0.3 mg/kg). 151",

This trend holds true for many classes of nanoparticles including AuNPs [270], SiNPs [271], and polymeric nanoparticles [272] Conversely, smaller nanoparticles (<5 nm) are typically excreted in the urine. In nearly all cases, coating nanoparticles with polyethylene glycol (PEG) confers \"stealth\" properties for prolonged circulation and evasion of excretion. \n\nWith the successful launch of multiple LNP-delivered RNA drugs in the past few years, many have sought to modify LNP tropism to expand their therapeutic utility. For example, preferential organ accumulation of systemically administered ionizable LNPs can be modulated by the amount of cationic lipids used during formulation [172,173]. Moreover, differential delivery of RNA LNPs to cell types within the liver is also possible by adjusting the proportion of PEG-lipid [273]. Multiple reports have also demonstrated that both charge and size of LNPs affect their tropism and delivery to different immune cell subtypes [274]. \n\nFor bioinspired nanocarriers such as cell-derived exosomes, particle properties are less easily manipulated, as their composition is already defined at the time of harvesting. The protein and lipid composition of exosomes' outer membrane largely determines its specificity. Exosomes are preferentially taken up by target cells with similar membrane composition to the production cell. Thus, one strategy for targeting exosomes to the correct tissue is to isolate them from the same types of cells as the target.",

Despite some progress, delivery systems are still unable to fully achieve this. Here, we reformulate lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) through adjustments in lipid material structures and compositions to systematically achieve the pulmonary and hepatic (respectively) targeted mRNA distribution and expression. A combinatorial library of degradable-core based ionizable cationic lipids is designed, following by optimisation of LNP compositions. Contrary to current LNP paradigms, our findings demonstrate that cholesterol and phospholipid are dispensable for LNP functionality. Specifically, cholesterol-removal addresses the persistent challenge of preventing nanoparticle accumulation in hepatic tissues. By modulating and simplifying intrinsic LNP components, concurrent mRNA accumulation and translation is achieved in the lung and liver, respectively. This targeting strategy is applicable to existing LNP systems with potential to expand the progress of precise mRNA therapy for diverse diseases.",

This would permit electrostatic interactions with targeted tissues since both structures would have complementary charges.

For example, LNPs that contain lipids with low pKa values (eg, YSK05 and YSK13-C3 with pKa values of 6.50 and 6.45 pKa, respectively) are distributed in hepatocytes. Whereas, those containing lipids with higher pKa values (eg, YSK13-C4 and YSK15-C4 with pKa values of 6.80 and 7.10, respectively) are distributed in LSECs, 32 which are border cells that are located between hepatocytes and the blood stream. 16,17 However, due to the limited range of pKa values (5.70-7.25) that were tested in that previous study, 32 higher pKa values were not evaluated and the optimal pKa value for an LNP for uptake by LSECs was not confirmed. Furthermore, despite the enhanced pKa-dependent distribution of YSK13-C4-and YSK15-C4-LNPs in LSECs, the silencing activity in those cells was relatively weak, probably due to their inactivation by EL which are distributed in LSECs and have phospholipase activity that cleaves the ester linkage present in those lipids. 32,41",

Methods We report herein on optimizing the targeting efficiency of a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) by manipulating the acid dissociation constant (pKa) value of its membrane, which reflects its ionization status. Instead of changing the chemical structure of the lipids to achieve this, we used a mixture of two types of pH-sensitive cationic lipids that show different pKa values in a single LNP. We mixed various ratios of YSK05 and YSK12-C4 lipids, which have pKa values of 6.50 and 8.00, respectively, in one formulation (referred to as YSK05/12-LNP). Results The pKa of the YSK05/12-LNP was dependent not only on the molar ratio of each lipid but also on the individual contribution of each lipid to the final pKa (the YSK12-C4 lipid showed a higher contribution). Furthermore, we succeeded in targeting and delivering short interfering RNA to liver sinusoidal endothelial cells using one of the YSK05/12-LNPs which showed an optimum pKa value of 7.15 and an appropriate ionization status (~36% cationic charge) to permit the particles to be taken up by liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. Conclusion This strategy has the potential for preparing custom LNPs with endless varieties of structures and final pKa values, and would have poten tial applications in drug delivery and ionic-based tissue targeting.",

Interestingly, nanoparticles that were internalized into parenchymal liver cells did not co-localize with Slc10a1 fluorescent signals. Myr-preS2-31 still colocalized with Slc10a1 suggesting that the targeting ligand was separated from the nanoparticle during cellular internalization as already observed in in vitro experiments. This phenomenon was confirmed by a colocalization analysis ( Figure 6C). The observed cellular uptake is a surprising finding since HBV possesses pronounced host species specificity with regard to binding and infectivity. HBV binds to murine hepatocytes but cannot infect mice due to the lack",

            "text": "Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) are specific to the liver microcirculation. LSEC line the liver capillaries and transport blood from branches of the portal vein and the hepatic artery into the central vein of liver lobules. They provide a porous barrier between blood components and liver parenchymal cells, i.e., hepatocytes. Moreover their endocytic capacities make them effective scavengers for molecules such as albumin, acetylated low-density lipoproteins (Ac-LDL) and antigens in the bloodstream [1,2]. \n\nAt the interface between blood components and parenchymal cells, LSEC are able to interact with various cell types and participate in several physiological and pathological events. For example, LSEC dysregulation is believed to constitute a critical step in liver fibrosis [3] and in non-alcoholic steato-hepatitis progression [4]. Moreover, LSEC have dual roles in liver tissue in the surgical setting, having deleterious effects through involvement in ischemia-reperfusion injury during liver transplantation [5,6] and beneficial effects through regulating and orchestrating liver regeneration following partial hepatectomy [7]. Notably, we detailed in a recent review the potential role of the interactions between platelets and LSEC in the regenerative process [8,9]. \n\nTo study the biological functions of LSEC and to identify the interplay between LSEC and other blood or liver cells, techniques allowing for the isolation and purification of LSEC have been developed over the last decades. Early methods for liver cell dispersion relied on liver tissue mechanical disruption or on differences in cell-specific sensitivity to enzymatic digestion. LSEC enrichment was obtained by isopycnic gradient centrifugation or selective adherence to materials. Currently, published isolation protocols rely on liver tissue enzymatic digestion, discarding parenchymal cells and then further purification of LSEC from the non-parenchymal cell fraction.",

            "text": "Due to the direct contact with blood and its carried substances, it is not surprising that LSECs possess very efficient endocytic capacity that is superior to any professional APCs within the body (19,20). To fulfill their engulfing potential, LSECs express various scavenger receptors (e.g., Stabilin 1, 2, and B1), lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1, and a range of C-type lectin receptors (21)(22)(23). LSECs efficiently endocytose soluble molecules or particles under 200 nm, whereas KCs attached to LSECs within the sinusoids cover particles and debris exceeding 200 nm (24). Together, they create a well-controlled functional dichotomy for constantly probing the liver environment.\n\nLiver sinusoidal endothelial cells constitutively carry low level of MHC-II and are able to upregulate its expression upon exposure to inflammatory cytokines (25,26). Na\u00efve CD4 + T-cells primed by LSECs under steady state differentiate into regulatory T-cells (Tregs) that lack the transcription factor Forkhead-Box-Protein P3 (FoxP3), which is normally expressed by Tregs generated by professional APCs (27). These LSEC-induced CD25 low FoxP3 \u2212 T-cells are very immune suppressive (27). This aspect of LSEC-mediated antigen presentation could provide therapeutic benefits. Nanoparticles loaded with autoantigens are taken up by LSECs and lead to MHC-II presentation and to the consequent induction of regulatory CD4 + T-cells (28). Importantly, LSEC-targeted nanoparticles were able to reverse experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in vivo (28).\n\nLiver sinusoidal endothelial cells are not only able to present exogenous antigen on MHC-II but also on MHC-I and thus capable of cross-presentation ( Figure 1C) (29). Surprisingly, LSECs can cross-present soluble antigens even more efficiently than DCs (20,30). This antigen presentation, however, is only limited to a short time period due to the",

The underlying mechanisms breaking hepatic lipid homeostasis include decreased mitochondrial fatty acid b-oxidation, increased de novo lipogenesis, and enhanced uptake of fatty acids to the liver. 34,35 The excessive accumulation of lipid metabolites causes lipotoxicity and eventually induces liver injury. 36 Although the pathogenesis of fatty liver has received much attention over the past few decades, the primary study results are from adult animal models fed with a high-fat diet. 37,38 There still are large gaps in understanding the regulation of the transition from fetal liver to mature liver after birth.",

A notable functional characteristic of LSECs is their high endocytic capacity compared to other endothelial cells, playing a key role in the elimination of macromolecules and residual nanoparticles carried by the blood. LSECs have a structure with small pores that facilitate the passage of molecules between the blood and hepatocytes but also allows for the capture of larger particles. This helps filter substances present in the blood that circulate through the hepatic sinusoids. They express several types of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including scavenger receptors, which are particularly important for capturing modified lipoproteins, immune complexes, fragments of dead cells, and molecular debris. These receptors allow LSECs to identify and internalize substances that need to be eliminated from the bloodstream, capturing macromolecules, cellular debris, and nanoparticles. These cells recognize nanoparticles as foreign particles and phagocytize them before they reach the target tissue. This can reduce the amount of nanoparticles that reach the desired location, decreasing the effectiveness of the treatment. They can also reduce the circulation time of nanoparticles in the blood by capturing them quickly, especially if the nanoparticles do not have coatings that protect them from this capture. This is particularly problematic for treatments that require prolonged distribution or accumulation in specific target tissues [68,71]. \n\nTo avoid early capture by scavenger cells, nanoparticles can be modified with coatings that reduce recognition by these cells. Stealth nanocarriers are drug delivery systems designed to evade detection by the immune system, prolonging their circulation in the body and enhancing the efficiency of transporting active substances to target sites, such as specific tissues or cells [72]. These nanocarriers have the ability to escape elimination by the reticuloendothelial system, especially by phagocytic cells in the liver and spleen, which normally detect and remove foreign particles from the blood.",

The isolation of hepatocytes was performed using density gradientbased separation. Then, magnetic beads were used for the isolation of KCs and LSECs (Fig. 2O), respectively, and the rest of cells are considered as other nonparenchymal cells. As shown in Fig. 2 (P and Q) , the exosome positive rate of KCs, LSECs, hepatocytes, and other nonparenchymal cells were 64.5, 58.2, 22.9, and 26.7%, respectively. In addition, the relative mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of KCs (62.8) and LSECs (61.7) was also higher than those of hepatocytes (37.7) and other nonparenchymal cells (26.1). KCs and LSECs are the main composition of the hepatic reticuloendothelial system, and these two cell types are largely involved in the pathological process of liver diseases, including liver fibrosis, hepatic ischemia reperfusion injury, drug-induced injury, HCC, etc. (34)(35)(36). Hepatocytes are the predominant liver cells, comprising about 57% of total liver cells, followed by LSECs (23.2%), KCs (15%), and other liver cells (4.8%) (37). In considering both cell population and exosome uptake (relative MFI), most of the injected exosome RNP nanocomplexes were taken up by hepatocytes, which are related to metabolic disorders and HCC.",

Upon entering the cells through endocytosis, they become positively charged in the acidic environment of endosomes, facilitating the subsequent release of the RNAs into the cytoplasm. However, LNP-formulated mRNAs tend to accumulate in the liver, possibly due to the binding of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) onto the LNP surface followed by the ApoE receptor-mediated uptake to hepatocytes [50]. Most of the LNP-mRNA drugs are concentrated in the liver and spleen after tail vein administration, while a small amount is preserved in adipose tissues [87]. When administered intramuscularly, the expression of mRNA drugs is mainly found in the liver, muscle, and lymph nodes [88,89].\n\nIn addition, non-liver delivery of LNP may be achieved by modifying lipid compositions, which includes changing the lipid identities and/or adjusting lipid ratios. The LNP composition can substantially affect the intracellular delivery efficiency, determine cell specificity of delivery, and modulate immunogenicity.\n\nFor instance, the addition of SORT lipids to LNP changed the organ-targeting properties of LNP in vivo and achieved mRNA delivery to a lot of organs other than the liver [90]. Moreover, SORT is compatible with various gene-editing technologies, such as Cas9 mRNA/sgRNA and Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex. Changes in LNP surface chemistry through modulating PEG-lipid structure were found to assist LNP targeting of bone marrow endothelial cells in the hematopoietic stem cell niche [91], which may also be used in mRNA delivery. Interestingly, LNP technologies can achieve targeted delivery by adjusting the stoichiometry of LNP components, which was exemplified by the success in lymph node-targeting delivery of mRNA in mice [92].\n\nOther strategies, like additional non-lipid components in LNP formulation, also contribute to the",

Upon intravenous administration, most LNPs accumulate in the liver and spleen, where they are taken up by reticuloendothelial system (RES) cells or hepatocytes, restricting their distribution to other tissues (Shi et al., 2011;Sago et al., 2019). As a result, their therapeutic effectiveness at tumor sites may be compromised (El Moukhtari et al., 2023;Gomes-da-Silva et al., 2012). \n\nIn order to overcome such limitations, focus has been drawn to the development of new strategies to evade the RES clearance of nanoparticles (Ouyang et al., 2020).

Therefore LNPs are typically modified, e.g., by including PEG-lipids, to minimise renal clearance (63). This might of course be a counterproductive strategy in the development of any kidney-targeting therapy. Indeed, there are very few examples of LNPs that have been developed to deliver RNA to kidney cells, and certainly to rTECs. As proof of principle that this could be possible, one group were able to effect gene silencing in mesangial and glomerular endothelial cells in a mouse model of IgA nephropathy, using polyethyleneimine-containing, octa-arginine-coated liposomes (34).",

            "text": "Non-viral delivery of the gene editing system typically implies using lipid/polymeric materials for the formulation of RNA encoding the gene editing components or, in some cases, protein complexes that directly perform gene editing in nanoparticles. A lipid nanoparticle (LNP) is composed of (1) an ionizable, cationic lipid or polymeric material, which facilitates RNA entrapment in the nanoparticle; (2) a zwitterionic lipid; (3) cholesterol to stabilize the lipid layer; and (4) polyethylene glycol (PEG) to stabilize the LNP in the extracellular space [29,44]. This complex composition enables in vivo targeted delivery through several processes: stabilization of the cargo in the extracellular space; protection against immune system activation; LNP-mediated delivery to a particular cell type; and endosomal escape into the cytoplasm. Ultimately, hepatic delivery occurs through a combination of two mechanisms: passive targeting via endothelial fenestrae that are present in human liver sinusoids [45] and apolipoprotein binding to the LNP, which facilitates liver uptake [29,44]. \n\nCompared to viral delivery, LNPs elicit much weaker immune responses in vivo, which translates into their representing a safer technology and also provides potential for redosing the drug several times and increasing the efficacy of the treatment [29,30,44]. Furthermore, the expression of the gene editing component from the mRNA is transient and therefore is associated with lower immunogenicity and fewer off-target effects [44]. \n\nLNPs can be optimized for targeting different cell types in vivo; in particular, significant progress has been achieved in targeting hepatocytes [29]. Recent clinical data have shown the safety and efficacy of the gene editing therapy NTLA-2001 designed to treat hereditary amyloidosis through TTR gene knockdown in the liver [46].",

            "text": "We have shown that our biodegradable LNPs were successfully incorporated into liver hepatocytes and led to effective knockdown of target mRNA expression. 15 olipoprotein E (ApoE) and low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) are involved in the incorporation of LNPs into hepatocytes in vivo. 16 Plasma ApoE preferentially binds to PEG lipids of the LNP surface. LDLR proteins on hepatocytes recognize ApoE-LNP complexes, resulting in LNP incorporation via endocytosis. LNPs become cationic due to reduced pH during endosome maturation, leading to LNP fusion to the endosomal membrane. 17 siRNA is finally released into the cytoplasm, thereby inducing RNAi-mediated knockdown of target molecules in hepatocytes. \n\n3][24][25][26] Therefore, gene suppression in mononuclear phagocytes by LNPs may be an effective treatment strategy for such disorders. \n\nIn this study, we comprehensively analyzed the effects of our asymmetric ionizable lipid-based biodegradable LNPs on immune cells. LNPs were strongly incorporated into tissue-resident macrophages, including liver macrophages. Analysis of ApoE-deficient mice revealed that LNP uptake by liver macrophages is not dependent on ApoE expression. Administering LNPs encapsulating siRNA targeting interferon regulatory factor-5 (IRF5) (siIrf5-LNPs), an essential transcription factor in triggering inflammatory responses, reduced IRF5 expression in macrophages in vivo. Furthermore, prophylactic administration of siIrf5-LNPs was effective in preventing liver damage in concanavalin A (Con A)-induced hepatitis. These results indicate that our biodegradable LNPs are a useful tool for analyzing macrophage function in vivo, and they can be used in novel therapies for treating inflammatory diseases.",

            "text": "Notably, Phase 0 clinical trial to treat plaque psoriasis with inhibitors AVX001 has validated efficacy and safety in human subjects [99]. Meanwhile, combination of atorvastatin and endothelin-receptor-A antagonist ambrisentan significantly reverses the abnormal liver function, restores the HSC quiescent phenotype and improves insulin resistance [100]. Thus, it is intriguing if delivery of IVA-PLA2 inhibitors, or atorvastatin into LSEC cells with mannose-conjugated LNP could block NASH progression. \n\nThe current limitation of LSEC-targeting approaches is that it primarily diminishes hepatic inflammation, but not lipid accumulation. Therefore, its combination with other therapeutic modalities may be essential to resolve NASH. Here are the main hallmarks that innovative nanoparticles have to resolve NASH by enhancing liver-targeting capabilities. \n\n(1) The expanded diversity of drug targets Targeting the \"undruggable\" genes is challenging for small molecules. Nevertheless, non-coding RNAs and mRNA in nanoparticles effectively manipulate the genes, non-coding transcripts to treat liver diseases [101]. Thus, it significantly expands the scope of drug targets. \n\n(2) Cell and organelle-specificity to treat NASH Long-term safety, tolerability and blockade of compensatory pathways are critical for the success of novel NASH therapeutics [8]. The application of lipid nanoparticles on treatment of liver diseases has been reviewed previously [102]. Notably, cell and organelle-specific delivery based on specific ligand-receptor interaction is essential for further precise modulation of gene function. \n\n(3) The novel vectors to minimize long-term toxicity and accumulation in vivo \n\nMany of the recent delivery systems have exhibited potencies and safety in human subjects. Nevertheless, the long-term toxicity and accumulation of nanoparticles in vivo should be assessed cautiously. \n\nBiocompatible and biodegradable vectors will address the issues. \n\n(4) The feasibility of integrating different delivery tools \n\nTargeting the multiple hubs in NASH progression simultaneously, such as GIP/GLP-1 dual agonists tirzepatide [103], confers higher efficacy than mono-target therapies do.",

Conjugation of targeting ligands on the LNPs surface proved to be effective in facilitating the uptake by specific organs in small-scale settings. For instance, conjugated antibodies targeted against vascular cell adhesion molecules VCAM-1 or PECAM-1 and CD-4 were employed to redistribute the LNPs from liver to lung, cerebral endothelium during brain oedema and in all T cells (na\u00efve, memory, central, and effector) in both lymph and spleen, respectively [120].

            "text": "an intermediate near-neutral net charge [153]. Consistent with the above findings, highly positive LNPs targeted the lungs and highly negative LNPs targeted the spleen, while intermediate charge levels predominantly targeted the liver. Liver targeting has been shown to depend on Apo-E binding to near-neutral liposomes or LNPs [154], which does not occur for negatively charged liposomes [155].\n\nNotably, all of the above charge-mediated targeting studies have been done using IV administration and the routes typically used for vaccination, such as the intramuscular or intradermal routes, have not been examined. Most studies that analyze expression after intramuscular injection do, however, detect the systemic trafficking of mRNA LNPs, which are rapidly and strongly expressed in the liver, at the same time as they are expressed in muscle and draining lymph nodes [97,156,157]. These particular LNPs therefore seem to enter the vasculature and are subsequently expressed in liver hepatocytes due to passive ApoE-mediated targeting, which is not surprising since they were designed for hepatocyte targeting. This systemic distribution and expression of immunogens could, however, generate systemic cytokines, complement activation and lead to other potential undesirable effects that could amplify the frequency or severity of adverse events and/or impair immune response generation. Finally, only a limited number of studies have been carried out with ligand-mediated targeting of LNPs. Lung endothelial cell targeting was achieved by conjugating CD31 (PECAM) antibodies to the LNP and injecting intravascularly [158]. The liver hepatocyte-directed LNP then became largely redirected to the lung. A similar approach using a VCAM ligand successfully targeted LNPs to inflamed regions of the brain and alleviated TNF-\u03b1-induced brain edema [159]. Dendritic cells in vitro were also more efficiently transfected using a mannosylated liposome, which may be a strategy applicable to vaccination [160]. Higher throughput screening methods to identify ligands targeting specific cell types have also been developed and may be applicable for the targeting of specific dendritic cell subsets [161",

            "text": "This structural change allowed the GMC drug to penetrate into the LNPs' core, leading to effective encapsulation of the GMC. Furthermore, during the synthesis of LNPs, we added DSPE-mPEG2000, which effectively prevents LNPs from binding to plasma proteins and being prematurely cleared by the mononuclearphagocyte system, thereby extending the circulation time of LNPs [40]. LNPs can enter the liver through the pores of the liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. A portion of the LNPs may be phagocytosed by the hepatic reticuloendothelial system (RES) and delivered to lysosomes, where the drug is released after lysosomal dissolution. Another portion may bind to the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and other lipid-associated receptors on the surface of liver cells and enter the cells via endocytosis to exert its therapeutic effect [21]. \n\nOur results demonstrate that LNP-GMC exhibited minimal cytotoxicity in vitro and did not induce significant hemolysis in vivo, suggesting that LNPs are a biologically safe medium for hepatic drug delivery. This finding aligns with previous studies supporting lipid-based carriers for hepatic applications, citing their biocompatibility and minimal adverse effects [41]. However, some studies have noted that interactions between nanoparticles and immune cells may induce subtle immune responses, even when biocompatibility is high [42]. Although we observed no significant immune responses in our experimental model, future research could further assess potential immune interactions under a range of clinical conditions to ensure that LNP-GMC is suitable for broad application in ALI patients. \n\nLNPs of different sizes have different biological distribution and physical properties in vivo [43]. In the LNP synthesis process, we can control the particle size by optimizing factors such as lipid composition, ethanol-to-aqueous phase ratio, injection rate, and stirring speed [40]. In our study, to ensure both uniformity and a consistent diameter of approximately 200 nm, the synthesized mixture was subjected to physical extrusion through a 200 nm polycarbonate film.",

The CL4H6 lipid contains two very long hexyl oleate chains (C24 + O1) ( Fig. 2A). The CL4H6-LNPs exhibited an ED 50 of 0.0025 mg/kg in a mouse F7 model. We found that 4.2% of the siRNA was loaded in the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) at 24 h after intravenous administration, suggesting that endosomal escape was better compared to MC3. The CL4H6 also exhibited a better tolerability compared to MC3-LNPs due to the fact that the CL4H6 is biodegradable. It is known that phosphocholine (PC)-containing neutral lipids, including phosphatidylcholines and sphingomyelins (SMs), are cylindrical-shaped and therefore stabilize bilayers and strongly inhibit membrane fusion [52,57]. We revealed that the long hexyl oleate scaffolds can overcome the inhibitory effect of PC-containing neutral lipids on the fusogenicity of the LNPs",

            "text": "In this study, we developed functionalized polymeric micelles (FPMs) loaded with simvastatin (FPM-Sim) as a drug delivery system to target liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) for preserving liver function in chronic liver disease (CLD). Polymeric micelles (PMs) were functionalized by coupling peptide ligands of LSEC membrane receptors CD32b, CD36 and ITGB3. Functionalization was confirmed via spectroscopy and electron microscopy. In vitro and in vivo FPM-Sim internalization was assessed by means of flow cytometry in LSECs, hepatocytes, Kupffer and hepatic stellate cells from healthy rats. Maximum tolerated dose assays were performed in healthy mice and efficacy studies of FPM-Sim were carried out in bile duct ligation (BDL) and thioacetamide (TAA) induction rat models of cirrhosis. Functionalization with the three peptide ligands resulted in stable formulations with a greater degree of in vivo internalization in LSECs than non-functionalized PMs. Administration of FPM-Sim in BDL rats reduced toxicity relative to free simvastatin, albeit with a moderate portal-pressure-lowering effect. In a less severe model of TAA-induced cirrhosis, treatment with FPM-CD32b-Sim nanoparticles for two weeks significantly decreased portal pressure, which was associated with a reduction in liver fibrosis, lower collagen expression as well as the stimulation of nitric oxide synthesis. In conclusion, CD32b-FPM stands out as a good nanotransporter for drug delivery, targeting LSECs, key inducers of liver injury.",

These mice express membrane-targeted eGFP in the LSEC, while membranes of the other cell types of the liver remain red (Video 3). The LSECs line the sinusoidal lumen and their nuclei show only a weak Hoechst signal compared to hepatocytes. Remarkably, in Tie2 \u00d7 mT/mG reporter mice further cells in the sinusoidal lumen also express eGFP. Among them, platelets appear as small flakes rapidly flowing through the sinusoids, which is helpful for identification of the direction of the blood flow. These platelets can form transient aggregates (Video 3, 21-34 min).\n\nLSEC can also be stained by fluorescently labeled latex nanoparticles. Particles with a diameter larger than 500 nm are known to be exclusively taken up by macrophages. In contrast, smaller sized particles, below 100 nm, are taken up by macrophages as well as by LSEC (Fig. 3c). While fluorescent latex nanoparticles visualize both LSEC and Kupffer cells, lectins such as wheat germ agglutinin preferentially bind to glycoproteins of LSEC (Video 6). Injection of fluorescently labeled lectins is therefore an additional method that can be used to mark the sinusoidal network.",

An intravenous injection of mercaptosuccinic acid (MSA)-capped cadmium telluride/cadmium sulfide (CdTe/CdS/QDs) showed that negatively charged QDs were selectively taken up by sinusoidal cells (KCs and LSECs) in rat liver, indicating that CdTe/CdS/QDs can be used for drug delivery to the LSECs [194]. Furthermore, Zn-labelled CdSelenide/CdS/ZnS QDs were also found in the KCs and LSECs 2h after an intravenous injection of polymer-coated Qdots, indicating their efficiency in drug delivery to the sinusoidal cells [195]. In addition, via the usage of nanoparticles carrying honokiol or adenovirus with the endothelial-cell-specific arginylglycylaspartic acid-roundabout guidance receptor 4 (RGD-ROBO4), ERK1/2 activation was promoted, leading to induced liver regeneration and reduced hepatic fibrosis due to high degree of LSEC specificity [196]. \n\nThe main studies targeting endothelial dysfunction in animal models of NAFLD/NASH/cirrhosis are summarized in Table 1. NASH in Balb/c mice [191]. In another attempt, CXCR4-targeted lipid-based NPs carrying VEGF siRNA were used for the treatment of liver fibrosis and hepatic cellular carcinoma; a combination therapy using both AMD-NPs (CXCR4 inhibitor) and VEGF siRNA abolished the infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages and reduced HCC tumor growth [192].

In the last few years, many studies were focused on targeted delivery of LNPs to organs (mainly to the spleen and lungs) via changes in the charge of the nanoparticles, which is determined by the helper lipid. This strategy is called Selective ORgan Targeting (SORT), and the lipid responsible for the selective delivery of nanoparticles to organs is Lipids ensuring targeting of LNPs to desired organs. \n\nFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org 05 Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org 08 called a SORT-lipid (Cheng et al., 2020). Besides, the SORT strategy can be applied in two ways: complete replacement of a helper lipid or partial replacement (introduction of a fifth component). \n\nIn LoPresti et al. (2022), it was found that complete replacement of a zwitterionic helper lipid with an anionic one induces greater accumulation of LNPs in the spleen as compared to the liver, whereas replacement with a cationic helper lipid leads to LNP accumulation in lungs. It must be noted that the nature of the helper lipid in that report did not have as much influence on nanoparticle biodistribution as did the charge of the lipid's polar head. \n\nIn Cheng et al. (2020); LoPresti et al. ( 2022); Radmand et al. (2023), it has been convincingly proven that the use of a cationic helper lipid drives the accumulation of LNPs in lungs. Besides, in Radmand et al. (2023); Kauffman et al. (2018), it has been demonstrated that the greatest accumulation of LNPs occurs in endothelial cells, which are most accessible to the bloodstream. The effect of cationic lipid DOTAP's proportion in LNPs on the biodistribution of nanoparticles is intriguing, as described in Cheng et al. (2020).",

These non-parenchymal cells also secret EVs that have demonstrated contributions to the pathogenesis and progression of NASH. LSECs account for about 50% of non-parenchymal cells in the liver and are anatomically located near HSCs. Wang et al. found that LSECs-derived exosomes containing the sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1) protein can activate HSCs in vitro [41]. When HSCs are activated, they release exosomes containing CCN2 that promote hepatic fibrosis [42]. Cholangiocytes are also exosome-releasing cells. Studies have shown enrichment of the long non-coding RNA",

            "text": "In addition, uncontrolled accumulation of these compounds may result in hepatotoxic reactions (Godfrey et al., 2017). Hence, siRNA for silencing of gene expression, or mRNA for gene expression are loaded in nanoparticles to carry these oligonucleotides past the LSECs and the liver and bring them intact to the cellular site of their intended therapeutic activity. Much effort is therefore spent to generate nanoparticles that carry therapeutic RNA to the intended cellular site. Out of a plethora of different types of nanoparticles that have been previously tested as vehicles for therapeutic RNA and other drug candidates, it appears that specially designed lipid nanoparticles have particularly attractive properties. This includes ease of manufacture, reduced immune responses, multidosing capabilities, larger payloads, and flexibility of design (Kulkarni et al., 2018). Although much effort is directed toward designing nanoparticles that reach the intended target cells with high precision and enable the RNA cargo to enter the intracellular compartment, the true \"elephant in the room, \" that is uncontrolled clearance by LSECs, is still a serious challenge that must be overcome. A few of those nanoparticlecarried RNA therapeutics that have made it successfully to the market include gene correction drugs that target the hepatocytes (Roberts et al., 2020). The LSECs allow passage of these nanoparticles (50 nm) through their fenestrae (i.e., open pores of diameter 100-150 nm). Circulating ApoB binds to these lipid nanoparticles, which mediate binding to the hepatocyte low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (Akinc et al., 2010). The same authors showed that conjugation of the particle surface with N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), a ligand for the GalNAc receptor [aka asialoglycoprotein receptor, or Ashwell-Morell receptor, (Morell et al., 1971)] that are present on hepatocytes, but not on LSECs, strengthened the uptake of these lipid nanoparticles to the hepatocytes.",

            "text": "In old ages, the thickness of the sinusoidal endothelium increases, and the window rate of endothelium decreases which leads to endothelial dysfunction. 101 The area of perforated endothelial cells decreases by 30%-50%. This is associated with increased intramedullary endothelial cell thickness and ECM, including collagen and basal lamina. Caloric restriction (CR) has a significant effect on sinusoidal endothelial cells, suggesting that the aging process involves pseudocapillarization. 101 CR also improves the age-related increase in sinusoidal mucosa skin cell thickness and ECM. Caveolin-1 is found to be strongly expressed parasinusally in young, healthy livers. The expression of caveolin-1 decreases with age, which is associated with the reduction of the sinus window. These associations support the conclusion that the fossae are structurally related to the fenestration and that changes in caveolin-1 expression are important during aging. 101 R alleviates the decrease in age-related caveolin-1 parasinus-like expression. 101 In conclusion, senescence is related to the changes of hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells and endothelial dysfunction. The known role of CR in age-related pseudocapillarization suggests that CR may be a new therapeutic target for the control of age-related dyslipidemia.    They have plenty of clathrin-coated vesicles and numerous endocytic receptors such as mannose receptors, Fc gamma-receptor IIb2 and stabilin receptors. 4 Therefore, LSECs have also been exploited as a target for the uptake of nanoparticles, especially for those with a diameter of 5-20 nm. 102,103 Thus, nanoparticles have been suggested as an efficient way of drug delivery to LSECs and other liver cells, 104,105 decreasing dosages, adverse drug reactions, and off-target effects. This kind of drug delivery technology may be promising for therapeutic agents that regulate fenestrations in the LSEC. In addition, statins may improve liver endothelial dysfunction and help to alleviate portal hypertension.",

This interaction promotes the binding of LNPs to low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLr), which are highly expressed on the hepatocytes. Receptor-mediated endocytosis is a key mechanism for the internalization of LNPs by hepatocytes, partially explaining the preferential targeting of the liver by intravenously administered LNPs (Liu et al., 2023). The widespread clinical application of gene therapy has been impeded by the absence of delivery vectors capable of inducing protein expression in extrahepatic organs and tissues (LoPresti et al., 2022). Recent efforts have redirected nucleic acid delivery towards tissues beyond the liver (Kimura and Harashima, 2023). The type and proportion of helper lipids can modify the LNP structure, are essential for the stability and tissue targeting of LNPs. For instance, ester and amide bonds in lipid compounds enhance targeting to the liver and lungs, respectively. Samuel T. LoPresti et al. observed that the complete substitution of conventional helper lipids with anionic or cationic lipids led to significant and consistent transfer of lipid nanoparticles specifically to the spleen or lung, respectively (LoPresti et al., 2022). Beyond their role as delivery components, lipids may exert therapeutic effects synergistically with mRNA-encoded proteins. Multifunctional lipid materials encompass self-adjuvant lipids that enhance vaccine efficacy and paclitaxel-derived lipids enabling the combined treatment of chemotherapy and gene therapy for cancer (Hou et al., 2021;Johnson et al., 2022).",

            "text": "Liver sinusoids are lined by liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC), which represent approximately 15 to 20% of the liver cells, but only 3% of the total liver volume. LSEC have unique functions, such as fluid filtration, blood vessel tone modulation, blood clotting, inflammatory cell recruitment, and metabolite and hormone trafficking. Different subtypes of liver endothelial cells are also known to control liver zonation and hepatocyte function. Here, we have reviewed the origin of LSEC, the different subtypes identified in the liver, as well as their renewal during homeostasis. The liver has the exceptional ability to regenerate from small remnants. The past decades have seen increasing awareness in the role of non-parenchymal cells in liver regeneration despite not being the most represented population. While a lot of knowledge has emerged, clarification is needed regarding the role of LSEC in sensing shear stress and on their participation in the inductive phase of regeneration by priming the hepatocytes and delivering mitogenic factors. It is also unclear if bone marrow-derived LSEC participate in the proliferative phase of liver regeneration. Similarly, data are scarce as to LSEC having a role in the termination phase of the regeneration process. Here, we review what is known about the interaction between LSEC and other liver cells during the different phases of liver regeneration. We next explain extended hepatectomy and small liver transplantation, which lead to \u201csmall for size syndrome\u201d (SFSS), a lethal liver failure. SFSS is linked to endothelial denudation, necrosis, and lobular disturbance. Using the knowledge learned from partial hepatectomy studies on LSEC, we expose several techniques that are, or could be, used to avoid the \u201csmall for size syndrome\u201d after extended hepatectomy or small liver transplantation.",

            "text": "After preparing YSK05/12-LNPs in which the membranes have different pKa values, the in vivo knockdown activity of these LNPs was evaluated. Basically, the intrahepatic activity of YSK05/12-LNPs was compared with that of the original YSK05-or YSK12-C4-LNPs (the pKa values for all these preparations are shown in Figure 3). The formulation that induced the strongest knockdown activity in hepatocytes was YSK05-LNP (pKa 6.50), while the activities for the YSK05/12-LNPs and YSK12-C4-LNP, which have higher pKa values, were considerably lower (Figure 5A). A possible reason behind the hepatocyte uptake of YSK05-LNP might be related to the fact that hepatocytes preferentially take up neutral particles with lower pKa values through the apolipoprotein E-low density lipoprotein receptor pathway, and this coincides with previous reports. 32,43 On the other hand, in LSECs, despite the weak activity of both YSK05and YSK12-C4-LNPs, using mixtures in YSK05/12-LNP dramatically improved their activity in LSECs as the result of optimizing the pKa value for the LNP membrane to 7.15 (Figure 5B). A possible reason behind this is the preference of endothelial cells to take up slightly cationic particles which electrostatically interact with the slightly anionic charge of the endothelial membrane. \n\nThe YSK05/12-LNP formulation which is composed of YSK05/YSK12-C4/cholesterol/ m PEG 2k -DMG (50:20:30:2 mol%) and a pKa value of 7.15 was chosen for use in experiments to target LSECs and compared with YSK05-LNP.",

            "text": "49 Furthermore, the use of galactosylated PEI targeting the ASGPR proved to be very efficient in transducing human hepatic cell lines and the livers of mice and rats. PEI nanoparticles and derivatives have been used experimentally for the delivery of different drugs, including siRNA and microRNAs (miRNAs), for the treatment of liver malignancies, but no clinical studies have yet been performed. 50 Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have very similar composition to cell membranes. Th y are formed by amphiphilic lipids that when dispersed in an aqueous environment spontaneously form spherical structures with a hydrophilic interior. LNPs are a suitable carrier for nucleic acid delivery because of their excellent biocompatibility, biodegradability, low toxicity and immunogenicity, structural flexibility, and ease of large-scale preparation. The use of LNPs has experienced a significant resurgence in GT as vehicles for siRNA and mRNAs. 51 However, the major challenge when developing LNP-based gene therapies is finding effective, tissue-specific delivery strategies. 52 Traditionally, targeting is achieved by physically or chemically conjugating ligands for specific receptors onto the nanoparticle surface. A  geting approach was developed by binding a multivalent GalNAc-cluster to the LNP. These nanoparticles have been shown to deliver mRNA molecules to hepatocytes with high efficiency, correcting mouse models of genetic diseases such as methylmalonic acidemia (MMA), PH1, GSD1a, citrin deficiency, acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), maple syrup urine disease, arginase deficiency, OTC deficiency, and progressive familial cholestasis type 3 (PFIC3). [53][54][55][56][57][58][59] The duration of action of a single dose of mRNA-LNP lasted between 2-3 weeks, requiring repeat administration to prolong a curative effect. These encouraging results supported the initiation of a phase I/II trial for the treatment of MMA (Table 1).",

An intravenous injection of mercaptosuccinic acid (MSA)-capped cadmium telluride/cadmium sulfide (CdTe/CdS/QDs) showed that negatively charged QDs were selectively taken up by sinusoidal cells (KCs and LSECs) in rat liver, indicating that CdTe/CdS/QDs can be used for drug delivery to the LSECs [194]. Furthermore, Zn-labelled CdSelenide/CdS/ZnS QDs were also found in the KCs and LSECs 2h after an intravenous injection of polymer-coated Qdots, indicating their efficiency in drug delivery to the sinusoidal cells [195]. In addition, via the usage of nanoparticles carrying honokiol or adenovirus with the endothelial-cell-specific arginylglycylaspartic acid-roundabout guidance receptor 4 (RGD-ROBO4), ERK1/2 activation was promoted, leading to induced liver regeneration and reduced hepatic fibrosis due to high degree of LSEC specificity [196]. \n\nThe main studies targeting endothelial dysfunction in animal models of NAFLD/NASH/cirrhosis are summarized in Table 1. as demonstrated by reduced ALT and AST serum and decreased hepatic alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) expression [190].",

            "text": "Autoimmune diseases are caused by adaptive immune responses to self\u2010antigens. The development of antigen\u2010specific therapies that suppress disease\u2010related, but not unrelated immune responses in general, is an important goal of biomedical research. We have previously shown that delivery of myelin peptides to liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) using LSEC\u2010targeting nanoparticles provides effective protection from CD4 T\u2010cell\u2010driven autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Here, we investigated whether this methodology might also serve antigen\u2010specific treatment of a CD8 T\u2010cell\u2010driven autoimmune disease. As a model for CD8 T\u2010cell\u2010mediated autoimmunity, we used OT\u20101 T\u2010cell\u2010driven cholangitis in K14\u2010OVAp mice expressing the cognate MHC I\u2010restricted SIINFEKL peptide in cholangiocytes. To study whether peptide delivery to LSECs could modulate cholangitis, SIINFEKL peptide\u2010conjugated nanoparticles were administered intravenously one day before transfer of OT\u20101 T cells; five days after cell transfer, liver pathology and hepatic infiltrates were analysed. SIINFEKL peptide\u2010conjugated nanoparticles were rapidly taken up by LSECs in vivo, which effectively cross\u2010presented the delivered peptide on MHC I molecules. Intriguingly, K14\u2010OVAp mice receiving SIINFEKL\u2010loaded nanoparticles manifested significantly reduced liver damage compared with vehicle\u2010treated K14\u2010OVAp mice. Mechanistically, treatment with LSEC\u2010targeting SIINFEKL\u2010loaded nanoparticles significantly reduced the number of liver\u2010infiltrating OT\u20101 T cells, which up\u2010regulated expression of the co\u2010inhibitory receptor PD\u20101 and down\u2010regulated cytotoxic effector function and inflammatory cytokine production. These findings show that tolerogenic LSECs can effectively internalize circulating nanoparticles and cross\u2010present nanoparticle\u2010bound peptides on MHC I molecules. Therefore, nanoparticle\u2010mediated autoantigen peptide delivery to LSECs might serve the antigen\u2010specific treatment of CD8 T\u2010",

            "text": "Messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics have demonstrated significant potential in treating cancer, genetic disorders, and infectious diseases, as exemplified by the approval of COVID-19 mRNA or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccines [1][2][3][4]. A critical factor in their success is the use of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), which are among the most advanced and effective delivery systems for nucleic acid therapeutics. LNPs are formulated with a lipid mixture that usually includes an ionizable lipid, cholesterol, a phospholipid, and a polyethylene glycol (PEG)-lipid [5,6]. However, systemic administration of LNPs leads to predominant mRNA expression in the liver, highlighting the need for novel strategies capable of efficiently targeting extrahepatic tissues for therapeutic applications beyond liver-related diseases or vaccines [7][8][9]. \n\nSeveral approaches have been explored for achieving organ-specific mRNA-LNP delivery beyond the liver, focusing on passive (endogenous) and active (ligand-mediated or exogenous) targeting strategies [10]. Active targeting strategies rely on the addition of targeting ligands to the LNP surface, such as antibodies, peptides, or small molecules, to direct the LNP toward certain cell receptors [11]. Conversely, passive targeting depends on the meticulous design of LNPs, adjusting lipid ratios or incorporating additional lipids to promote the formation of a specific endogenous protein corona upon their introduction into the bloodstream. This protein corona effect has been attributed to different LNP properties such as size, apparent pKa, zeta potential, and PEGylation [12,13]. The passive targeting strategies are particularly promising, as they leverage a controlled structure without the need for additional ligands or modifications, hence reducing costs and regulatory hurdles and simplifying the scale-up process [14]. \n\nA well-established approach for passive targeting involves adding a fifth permanently charged lipid-cationic for lung targeting or anionic for spleen targeting-to enable selective organ targeting (SORT) [15,16]. However, this strategy has resulted in limited protein expression levels in targeted organs, indicating potential for further optimization.",

            "text": "The estimated mean annualized bleeding rate was significantly lower in the fitusiran prophylaxis group [3.1 (95% CI: 2.3-4.3)] than in the on-demand clotting factor concentrates group [31.0 (21.1-45.5); rate ratio 0.101 (95% CI: 0.064-0.159); p < 0.0001]. In the fitusiran group, 40 (51%) of 79 treated participants had no treated bleeds compared with 2 (5%) of 40 participants in the ondemand clotting factor concentrates group. [86] The size of LNPs can also influence their delivery in the liver. Clinically relevant LNPs typically have a small size of <60 nm. Since the average diameter of liver endothelial fenestrae is 107 \u00b1 1.5 nm, [87] LNPs with smaller sizes can easily pass through and be selectively taken up by hepatocytes. [1,79] Conversely, larger LNPs may have a greater propensity to accumulate in other cells in the liver, such as KCs and LSECs, which is helpful for a therapy-targeting liver fibrosis. Another strategy to enable LNP delivery to specific cell types in the liver is to engineer the LNP with surface-targeting ligands. For example, LSECs express high levels of mannose receptors on their surface, which can be used to selectively deliver LNP-mRNA to these cells by modifying the LNP surface with mannose. [88] Also, by adding a targeting peptide, LNPs have exhibited higher selectivity to HCC cells over normal liver tissues in an in vitro study. [89] Overall, the growing field of LNPs could accelerate the current challenges in liver disease treatment.",

            "text": "Lee et al. chemically synthesized 4A3-Cit as an ionizable cationic lipid. Synthesis by using unsaturated thiols showed improved transfection efficiency by 18-fold in vitro, and also a huge amount targeting the liver. 88 Unsaturation, like by Miao et al. helps target the liver more efficiently. Vitelline vein injection of the LNPs by Riley et al. targets fetal liver. 72 The targeted organ is decided by the structure of the polyamine-lipid core and the length of lipid epoxide, which are important for gene liver delivery. 72 NPs targeting other organs such as the spleen or lung are of value. Fenton et al. chemically synthesized new cationic lipids using EDC coupling and they succeeded in formulating lipid nanoparticles. 67 OF-Deg-Lin is the cationic lipid Fenton et al. synthesized. Because OF-Deg-Lin has improved electrophilicity and ester linkages in OF-Deg-Lin generate a nontoxic fatty acid, it is targeted to B lymphocytes of spleens. 67 Of-Deg-Lin mRNA LNPs are also delivered to the liver but protein translation does not proceed in liver cells. 67 This implies that mRNA with OF-Deg-Lin survives the enzymatic conditions in the spleen, but not in the liver. 67 The spleen is mainly composed of B cells and T cells. 131 Targeting T cells in the spleen is as valuable as targeting B cells. Lokugamage et al. synthesized a constrained adamantane cationic lipid, forming an armchair structure, which is able to deliver siRNA to T cells in vivo. 68 It is successfully targeted to T cells via natural trafficking, meaning an alternative to active targeting. 68 Li et al. developed a new lipid nanoparticle platform for COVID-19. TB-UC18 which targets the spleen showed that saturation and length of the lipid tail affect transfection efficiency, meaning that the more unsaturated and longer the lipid tail is, the higher the expression in the spleen. On the other hand, lipid nanoparticles could deliver genes to the lung efficiently.",

            "text": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a broad term covering a range of chronic liver diseases and is a major cause of conditions related to metabolic syndrome, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, and insulin resistance [1]. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is an advanced form of NAFLD and typically presents with steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis in the liver [2]. However, although several studies have tested various treatment approaches for NASH, there is no approved, effective therapy available to date [3][4][5]. \n\nThe vascular endothelium is the key barrier between the systemic circulation and tissues [6]. The liver endothelium is primarily composed of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) [7], which help maintain liver homeostasis and contribute to efficient nutrient and gas exchange [8]. Liver injury often begins with damage to the LSECs, and the importance of LSEC dysfunction in the pathogenesis of NAFLD and NASH has been described in detail [9,10]. After liver injury, LSECs increased sinusoidal capillarization and acquire pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic features [11][12][13]. Therefore, preventing LSEC capillarization may be an important factor in the treatment of NASH. \n\nTreatment with CU06-1004, a previously known as Sac-1004, ameliorates endothelial dysfunction and enhances endothelial barrier function through the cAMP/Rac/cortactin pathway in human vesicular endothelial cells (HUVECs) [14]. It has anti-hyperpermeability and antiinflammatory functions that help protect against EC dysfunction-related diseases such as cerebral ischemia, cancer, and diabetes [15][16][17]. However, the effects of CU06-1004 in animal models of NASH remain unclear. The choline-deficient, L-amino acid-defined (CDAA) dietinduced mouse model of NASH is commonly used to study aggressive NASH. Mice on the CDAA diet reliably develop hepatic steatosis, inflammation, liver fibrosis, and insulin resistance [18].",

            "text": "Notably, compared with LNPs with 3.0% PEG-lipid, mannose-incorporated LNPs showed the substantial decrease of tdTomato fluorescence in hepatocytes. While some discussion exists about the expression of CD206 on the surface of mice Kupffer cells, in our data, incorporation of mannose seemed to have little effect on the uptake of the LNPs by the Kupffer cells. These results demonstrated a highly effective targeting strategy to LSECs using mannose-incorporated LNPs. \n\nNext, we confirmed the selective targeting of siRNA-loaded LNPs with mannose to LSECs. LNPs were formulated with 1.5% PEG-lipid (with 1.0% mannose-PEG lipid) and 3.0% PEG-lipid (with 2.5% mannose-PEG lipid) for targeting LSECs and compared the FVIII gene silencing efficiency to that of LNPs with PEG-lipid only. As shown in Fig. 8 (A and C), similar to that of mRNA-loaded LNPs, LNPs with mannose-PEG lipid resulted in slightly bigger size than LNPs with PEG-lipid only. The prepared LNPs with siFVIII were injected into C57BL/6 mice at the dose of 0.5 mg/kg. After 2 days of injection, blood was collected and the level of FVIII protein in serum was validated. As shown in Fig. 8B, addition of mannose-PEG lipid into LNPs with 3% total PEG-lipid content showed a more enhanced FVIII inhibition in LSECs. On the contrary, for 1.5% PEG-lipid, incorporation of mannose to LNPs was less significant. This could be due to high ApoE adsorption at lower PEG content that facilitated the ApoE/LDLR-mediated uptake of LNPs. In addition, we further compared the LNP uptake using mannose-PEG lipid with that of galactose-PEG lipid. As expected, galactose-incorporated LNPs showed similar diameter of mannose-incorporated LNPs.",

            "text": "upregulated Warburg effect.)[17] The general strategy for heart targeting with glucose as a ligand has been recently validated in experimental animals for ischemic heart disease treated with poly-glucose nanoparticles.[18] Another important consideration is glycosylation of the tissue itself, i.e., the expression of glycoconjugates on cell surfaces, which has been shown to be important for AAV tropism.It is well known that many AAV serotypes utilize glycoconjugates, including sialic acid, as receptors [19].\n\nTo address the issues with off-targeting, various strategies have been developed that reduce phagocytic clearance by Kupffer cells (KCs) and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs).Unfortunately, there are only a few examples of non-AAV approaches that explored active liver detargeting applied to an i.v.-administered therapy.In one example, to improve gene therapy targeting, Robert Langer's group used a \"nano primer\" which is administered prior to lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) carrying mRNA.The nanoprimer is taken up by KCs and LSECs, which allows the LNPs to reach and transduce the hepatocytes [20].The mechanism of action is described as \"blocking the RES in the liver\" [20], which denotes the impairment of clearance mechanisms due to liver cells being \"overwhelmed\" by the high dose of the nano primer.A somewhat similar approach is described by Stephan Grabbe and colleagues, who injected an FcR-blocking agent prior to injecting NPs, resulting in a significant liver NP detargeting [21].Both approaches take advantage of an intrinsic ability of phagocytic liver cells to take up a bulk of non-therapeutic (sham) NPs to prevent the uptake of therapeutic cargo-carrying NPs.Remarkably, detargeting and targeting were accomplished in the same organ (i.e., the liver): the aforementioned liver detargeting technologies were developed to enable specific targeting of hepatocytes.",

Non-parenchymal liver cells (NPCs), largely comprising macrophages, dendritic cells, hepatic stellate cells and liver sinusoidal cells (LSECs), serve to induce immunological tolerance. Therefore, the liver is an important target for therapeutic approaches, in case of both (inflammatory) metabolic diseases and immunological disorders. This review aims to summarize current preclinical nanodrug-based approaches for the treatment of liver disorders. So far, nano-vaccines that aim to induce hepatitis virus-specific immune responses and nanoformulated adjuvants to overcome the default tolerogenic state of liver NPCs for the treatment of chronic hepatitis have been tested. Moreover, liver cancer may be treated using nanodrugs which specifically target and kill tumor cells. Alternatively, nanodrugs may target and reprogram or deplete immunosuppressive cells of the tumor microenvironment, such as tumor-associated macrophages. Here, combination therapies have been demonstrated to yield synergistic effects. In the case of autoimmune hepatitis and other inflammatory liver diseases, anti-inflammatory agents can be encapsulated into nanoparticles to dampen inflammatory processes specifically in the liver. Finally, the tolerance-promoting activity especially of LSECs has been exploited to induce antigen-specific tolerance for the treatment of allergic and autoimmune diseases.",

Located at the interface between blood and other liver cell types, LSECs mediate the exchange of substances between the blood and the Disse space, playing a crucial role in maintaining substance circulation and homeostasis of multicellular communication. As the initial responders to chronic liver injury, the abnormal LSEC activation not only changes their own physicochemical properties but also interrupts their communication with hepatic stellate cells and hepatocytes, which collectively aggravates the process of liver fibrosis. In this review, we have comprehensively updated the various pathways by which LSECs were involved in the initiation and aggravation of liver fibrosis, including but not limited to cellular phenotypic change, the induction of capillarization, decreased permeability and regulation of intercellular communications. Additionally, the intervention effects and latest regulatory mechanisms of anti-fibrotic drugs involved in each aspect have been summarized and discussed systematically. As we studied deeper into unraveling the intricate role of LSECs in the pathophysiology of liver fibrosis, we unveil a promising horizon that pave the way for enhanced patient outcomes.",

            "text": "Functional nucleic acids, such as siRNA, sgRNA and mRNA, were co-formulated into LNPs with a unique DNA barcode. They measured the functional Cre mRNA delivery of more than 250 LNPs to multiple cell types in vivo, and identified two LNPs that efficiently deliver siRNA, sgRNA and Cas9 mRNA to endothelial cells and mediate endothelial cell gene editing [195]. Combined with bioinformatics, the team performed in vivo directed evolution of RNA delivery, and identified one LNPs that effectively delivers siRNA and sgRNA to bone marrow endothelial cells (BMECs) in vivo [194]. Meanwhile, in vivo screening can help to reveal the relations between nanoparticle structures and activities. The tropism of BMEC was not related to the particle size, yet changed with PEG structure and the introduction of cholesterol. For example, the group found a targeting ligand-free LNP containing oxidized cholesterol delivered Cre mRNA into the liver microenvironment 5-fold more than to hepatocytes, suggesting that cholesterol chemical composition played an important role in LNP targeting [196]. By applying a siGFP/DNA-barcoded system in transgenic eGFP mice, the group found that constrained lipid nanoparticles (cLNPs) containing a conformationally constrained adamantane tail can deliver siRNA and sgRNA to splenic T cells in vivo at low doses [197], and in contrast to standard LNPs do not preferentially target hepatocytes. Based on this, the group further demonstrated cLNP containing adamantyl phospholipids can delivery Cre mRNA to liver immune cells at low doses [198]. Like reported before [188], delivery takes place in a size-independent and chemical composition-dependent manner, providing a potential alternative for further active targeting based on chemical modification and not targeting ligands. \n\nBy screening hundreds of nanoparticles simultaneously, the high throughput DNA barcodebased system helps the researcher to understand the delivery process of nanocarriers, elucidate chemical composition-activity relations and identify optimized nanoparticles for in vivo gene editing.",

These tiny engineered materials can effectively encapsulate and protect gene editing tools, enabling their safe delivery to target  (Jeong et al., 2023). These components collectively enable LNPs to effectively transport biologically active substances like nucleic acids and proteins into cells. The intracellular delivery efficiency of LNPs can be finely tuned through rational design and modification, by altering aspects such as lipid composition, particle size, and surface characteristics (Paunovska et al., 2022;Wang et al., 2023b). The key advantages of LNPs include their extremely small particle size, high stability, and biocompatibility, which enable effective drug protection and delivery efficiency. One of the characteristics of conventional LNPs is their resemblance to low-density lipoprotein (LDL), which leads to their recognition and uptake by LDL receptors predominantly present in liver cells (Raguram et al., 2022). This results in the accumulation of LNPs in the liver, posing a limitation for their use in targeting non-hepatic tissues or organs. To overcome this challenge and expand the utility of LNPs beyond hepatic applications, researchers have been developing various innovative strategies. One such approach involves localized LNP injections, where Palanki and colleagues have successfully identified the most effective LNPs in the perinatal mouse brain by administering intracerebroventricular (ICV) injections in fetal and neonatal mice (Palanki et al., 2023). Another strategy is the use of DNA barcoding to identify non-hepatic cell-tropic LNPs (Dahlman et al., 2017;Ni et al., 2022). This method leverages unique DNA barcodes to modify distinct LNPs, resulting in a highly selective and efficient nanodelivery system targeted towards specific cells or tissues. Targeted modification of LNPs to achieve redirection is also a promising approach.",

            "text": "The ability to modulate gene expression in endothelial cells (ECs) by localized delivery of nucleic acids has been a therapeutic goal for various disease challenges such as stroke, heart disease, diabetes, vascular disease, and severe infectious diseases and their treatment sequelae. 1 For this reason, delivery of therapeutic mRNA specifically to the ECs of specific organs and tissues has emerged as a new category of promising therapeutic agents. In nonviral gene delivery, a major advantage of mRNA compared to DNA cargoes is that mRNA does not require delivery into the cell nucleus. As a result, mRNA can achieve robust expression even of those proteins that are difficult to produce, especially in challenging cell types. However, for successful in vivo function, mRNA requires safe, effective, and stable delivery systems, which protect the nucleic acid from degradation and which allow for intracellular delivery of anionic nucleic acids, the latter known not to readily traverse the hydrophobic cell membrane lipid bilayer. A very potent delivery system for nucleic acids are lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), which were first approved as a small interfering RNA (siRNA) drug delivery vehicle in 2018 for the treatment of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis. 2 [4] However, the targeting scope of systemically administered LNPs coformulated with siRNA or mRNA has been expanded beyond their traditional tropism for hepatic and splenic tissues. Recognizing the vast therapeutic potential of mRNA-based interventions, researchers have pioneered strategies to guide mRNA delivery to extrahepatic sites. There has been a pronounced emphasis on devising RNA delivery systems that can selectively target and transfect ECs throughout the vasculature, with a heightened focus on the ECs of the pulmonary vasculature. A strategy that has demonstrated efficacy uses permanently charged cationic lipids and/or cationic lipidoids in the construction of nanoparticles tailored for EC targeting. [10][11] In recent advancements, the selective organ targeting (SORT) methodology has been introduced to refine neutral ionizable LNPs, originally designed for hepatocyte delivery. The biodistribution of these LNPs is modulated through the integration of an additional component, called the SORT lipid.",

            "text": "Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) line the liver microvasculature (sinusoids), providing a barrier between the hepatic blood flow and the hepatocytes. LSECs characteristically possess open fenestrae and unique in comparison to other endothelial cells, they lack an underlying basement membrane. These open fenestrae are 50-150 nm wide pores, which cluster together to act as a two-way channel for the flow of soluble molecules through the endothelial barrier between the blood and hepatocytes [38]. LSECs are also highly efficient scavengers, capable of clearing macromolecules, such as stabilin bound oxidized low density lipoprotein, by endocytic receptor-uptake and trans-cytosis to the Space of Disse, further contributing to the delivery of metabolic substrates from the blood to hepatocytes [39,40].\n\nSince the liver directly receives and processes antigen-enriched blood from the portal circulation and is therefore highly susceptible to the influx of pathogens, the liver has a central role in immunity [41]. Towards this function, LSECs provide an adhesive niche for myeloid cells and lymphocytes and the unique structure of LSECs allows na\u00efve lymphocytes to contact hepatocytes via cytoplasmic extensions through LSEC fenestrations [41,42]. LSECs also contribute towards regulation of T-cell activation and tolerance through their antigen-presenting capabilities [39]. Further contributing to the immunological function of the liver are Kupffer cells (KCs). Part of the reticuloendothelial system, these liver-resident macrophages patrol the sinusoidal blood under physiological conditions, acting as a filter to eliminate gut-derived bacteria and microbial by-products, as well as phagocytosing spent erythrocytes [43]. Within the sinusoid, KCs interact with lymphocytes, and are key in promoting T-cell tolerance to prevent immune responses to harmless antigens, which is imperative given the continuous exposure to innocuous antigens from the gut [44]. A wide repertoire of tissue-resident lymphocytes are found in the liver including conventional CD",

This work indicated that LSECs cultured on these gels exhibited loss of fenestrations, impaired hyaluronic acid endocytosis, and increased expression of cell adhesion molecules. Overall, these findings suggest a leading role of matrix stiffness in deregulating sinusoidal cells during liver disease progression. nasH Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Dufour's presentation (Inselspital) described the contribution of hepatic endothelial dysfunction to poor health outcomes in patients with NASH. Professor Dufour has previously outlined the therapeutic approaches for the treatment of NASH, (23) and in this lecture he updated the delegates on the current understanding of the role of sinusoidal cells in NASH. (24,25) Sinusoidal endothelial dysfunction precedes inflammatory and fibrotic progression in liver disease. (24) Of note, the loss of NO release from the endothelium contributes to increased intrahepatic resistance and activation of HSCs. (24) Targeting of cells expressing endothelial dysfunction markers, such as vascular adhesion-factor 1, with antifibrotic and inflammatory drugs may reduce the migration of immune cells to the liver and limit liver disease progression. (25) Other presented therapeutic approaches focused on targeting LSECs to resolve NASH. Miren Bravo (Vall d'Hebron Institut de Recerca [VHIR], Barcelona, Spain) presented data on the role of statins in restoring the LSEC phenotype and reducing portal pressure in a rat model of NASH without fibrosis. (26) NASH animals exhibited increased portal pressure, mainly due to endothelial dysfunction (decreased phosphorylated protein kinase B and phosphorylated endothelial nitric oxide synthase [NOS], increased endothelin 1 [ET-1] levels, and a higher predominance of dedifferentiated cluster of differentiation [CD]32b \u2212 LSECs). HSCs from these animals had reduced vitamin A storage and displayed activation of ET-1 downstream signaling. Treatment with statins resulted in a reduction in portal pressure levels, NASH reversion, and significant recovery of LSEC morphology, leading to a more quiescent phenotype of HSCs. (26",

The first strategy is the synthesis of various lipids with different chemical structures and pKa values for use in preparing LNPs with a wide range of membrane pKa values and screen the uptake and activity of each in LSECs. However, this method is time-and effort-consuming, not cost-effective, and results in limited pKa adjustments. Therefore, we adopted a more effective strategy, which involved mixing two lipids at different molar ratios with low and high pKa values in several LNP formulations to permit the pKa value of the final LNP membrane. These lipids are YSK05 (a pH-sensitive cationic lipid with a pKa value of 6.50), and YSK12-C4 (a highly cationic lipid with a pKa value of 8.00). Their chemical structures are shown in Figure 1. These lipids were chosen because they have a strong endosomal escape, strong activity (YSK05 in hepatocytes, in vivo, 33 and YSK12-C4 in dendritic cells, in vitro 36 ), and are resistant to the action of lipases.

This approach holds the potential to mitigate the undesirable delivery of LNPs to extrahepatic organs, thereby minimizing the occurrence of side effects. The asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) is overexpressed on the surface of hepatoma cells. It has been suggested that ASGPR-mediated endocytosis is an effective delivery strategy. 6][167][168] Another idea is to conjugate the LNPs with ASGPR mAb, which may be an attempt. 167 n a study by Kim et al., 169 it was found that achieving LSEC-specific RNA delivery, could not succeed by controlling the size and PEG-lipid content of LNPs. Due to the specific expression of mannose receptors on human and mouse LSECs, they prepared LNPs doped with 0.5-4.5% mannose PEG-lipid, and found that incorporation of mannose to LNPs with high PEG-lipid content (3%) has the best LSECs selective delivery effect. 169,170 Miao et al. 171 have proposed a glycolipid-like polymer named galactosylated chitosan oligosaccharide-SS-octadecylamine (Gal-CSSO). The galactosyl residues modified on it can selectively target HCs, the chitosan oligosaccharide is conducive to the endosomal escape, and the structure of -SS-can help the HC microenvironment respond to facilitate drug release. \n\nMany carriers with excellent liver selective delivery have been approved for drug delivery or have started clinical trials.

            "text": "specifically target \u03b1 V \u03b2 3 on the surface of nanocarriers, can significantly increase the tumor targeting ability of nanodrugs [8,9].\n\nOn the whole, to improve the targeting of liposomes, nano-micelles, or other nanocarriers, their stability and targeting should be improved through physical or biochemical methods. PEGylated nanocarriers greatly prolong the stability of nanocarriers and solve the nanocarriers' inability to circulate in the blood for a long time [9,10]. However, how to prevent nanocarriers from targeting other organs or tissues besides the liver is an unsolved problem. According to our current understanding, nanomedicines exhibit distinct liver affinity after systematic injection because of their natural physiological advantages, including slow blood flow [11,12] and discontinuous vasculature in hepatic sinusoids [13]. This targeting mechanism is similar to the tumor EPR effect mentioned above, which takes advantage of the discontinuity of vascular endothelium and the retention of nano-sized substances.\n\nIt is exciting to see new advances in the targeting of other organs and tissues besides the liver. James E. Dahlman previously reported a system called Fast Identification of Nanoparticle Delivery (FIND), which is capable of simultaneously quantifying >100 lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) delivering mRNA to multiple cell types in vivo [14]. They quantified more than 250 LNPs in vivo and identified two formulations that deliver RNA to endotheliocytes. The screening system uses designed DNA barcodes and the Cre-Lox animal model. After intravenous administration, flow cytometry and high-throughput sequencing systems are required to determine the cell distribution of different LNPs. Although this is a good screening platform, it is expensive and time consuming, and ordinary researchers may not have the capability to set up such a laboratory. Therefore, a predictable and efficient system to enhance the targeting ability and performance of nanocarriers to target organs is urgently needed.\n\nIn another study, Cheng et al. [15] proposed an intelligent approach called Selective Organ Targeting (SORT), which targets different organs, including the liver, spleen, and lung, based on charge regulation",

When comparing the delivery of more than 100 barcoded LNPs containing different cholesterol variants and analyzing distribution into eighteen cell types of the mouse, LNPs formulated with esterified cholesterol were found to be more effective in nucleic acid delivery than LNPs formulated with regular or oxidized cholesterol [191]. LNP containing cholesteryl oleate delivered siRNA and sgRNA more efficiently to liver endothelial cells than to hepatocytes. Information like this can be applied for the rational design of tissue-targeted nanocarriers. \n\nA biodistribution assay named the Quantitative analysis of nucleic acid therapeutics (QUANT) DNA barcoding was developed to compare the difference of nucleic acid nanoparticles delivery to multiple cell types in wild-type and Cav1 knockout mice [192]. QUANT DNA barcodes were rationally designed with a reduced secondary structure to increase DNA polymerase access, which enables digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) readouts and quantifies delivery with very high sensitivity. Direct comparing in vitro and in vivo nucleic acid delivery of 281 barcoded LNPs to endothelial cells and macrophages indicated that in vitro delivery to macrophages and endothelial cells could not predict the delivery to the same cell types in vivo [193]. Nanoparticles were formulated to carry a distinct DNA barcode and siICAM-2 and then the LNPs were pooled together and administered to mice intravenously. After 3 days, ICAM-2 Low endothelial cells were isolated and the DNA barcodes within that population were sequenced.

            "text": "Upon entering systemic circulation, LNPs (<100 nm) were mostly accumulated in the liver. In particular, LNPs with sizes of 45 to 80 nm showed significant silencing in hepatocytes. To figure out which types of liver cells were mostly interacting with the formulated LNPs, we prepared Cre mRNA (mCre)-loaded LNPs with their size under 100 nm. mCre was formulated into LNPs, and mCre dose of 0.5 mg/kg was injected into mice carrying a loxP-flanked stop cassette. Once a stop cassette is deleted, mice can express robust tdTomato fluorescence. Therefore, delivery of functional mCre allows the facile identification of cells transfected with formulated LNPs. As shown in Fig. 4A, robust tdTomato fluorescence was detected exclusively in the liver. To further confirm the cell type-specific gene edition in the liver, we extracted a mouse liver 2 days after injection and evaluated tdTomato fluorescence by the histology observation of liver tissue. Compared to phosphatebuffered saline (PBS)-injected mice, strong tdTomato fluorescence was detected in hepatocytes (Fig. 4B). To further examine transfection efficiency in different types of liver cells, we labeled hepatocytes, LSECs, and Kupffer cells with specific antibodies. Then, tdTomato fluorescence-positive cells were evaluated by histological analysis using the MetaMorph image software. As shown in Fig. 4C, 80% of hepatocytes, 40% of endothelial cells, and 10% of Kupffer cells exhibited the positive results of tdTomato fluorescence. In addition to the histological evaluation, tdTomato fluorescence-positive cells were also confirmed by flow cytometry analysis (fig. S9B). Transfection efficiency in hepatocytes was the highest among different types of liver cells.",

            "text": "These EVs enhance the recruitment of proinflammatory monocytes into the liver and their adhesion to the liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) [8][9][10]. \n\nLSEC are highly specialized endothelial cells, arranged as a discontinuous layer to form the vascular bed of the liver sinusoids and separate passenger leukocytes in the sinusoidal lumen from hepatocytes [11]. A histological section of a mouse liver depicting the positional relationship between LSEC and hepatocytes is shown in Figure 1. LSEC uniquely differentiate from other endothelial cells in the body by the lack of basement membrane and the presence of LSEC fenestrae. Fenestrae are 50-200 nm diameter pores covering 2-20% of the endothelial surface. Fenestrae are organized in clusters termed sieve plates that can be altered in response to different stimuli. These features enhance the endocytic capacity of the LSEC and facilitate the elimination of a variety of macromolecules, including lipids and lipoproteins, from the circulation by receptor-mediated endocytosis, making LSEC highly specialized scavenger cells [12]. Moreover, LSEC play a key role in the inflammatory response; they produce chemokines in response to various insults and serve as a platform for various immune cells to lodge in the liver. Therefore, specialized natural killer cells, lymphocytes, and myeloid cells adhere to the surface of LSEC to achieve residence in the liver [11]. LSEC play an anti-inflammatory role early on during NAFLD development by decreasing pro-inflammatory chemokine secretion [13].",

Besides, the current unavailability of LSEC promoter-driven Cre mice, which are essential tools for investigations into cell-specific gene activities, has created a bottleneck in the research concerning LSEC-associated liver diseases. \n\nLSECs hold a pivotal and indispensable role in maintaining the homeostasis of the liver endothelial niche, 6 orchestrating hepatocytes, 7 hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), 8 and Kupffer cells (KCs) 9 by enacting the intricate process of angiocrine signaling. Our research group has devoted considerable time and effort to investigating the regulatory function of LSECs in liver regeneration, 10 fibrogenesis, 11,12 and steatohepatitis. 13 Previously, we and other researchers have predominantly relied upon traditional and canonical EC markers like CD31, 14 VEGFR2, 15 or VEGFR3 16,17 to effectively label the hepatobiliary endothelium. However, none of them is liver-specific. Lyve1, which has been validated as a superior discriminator of LSECs, exhibits abundant expression in lymphatics and lung tissues. 18,19",

When in the circulation, some types of LNPs bind to serum proteins, including apolipoprotein E, which, in turn, binds to the lowdensity lipoprotein receptor. This receptor is highly expressed on hepatocytes and directs the LNP siRNA into these cells. 34,35 However, a fraction of the LNP siRNA is taken up by Kupffer cells, sinusoidal endothelial cells, and stellate cells, resulting in a significant amount of siRNA not accumulating in hepatocytes. 36 This can be largely avoided by changing the lipid composition in the LNP siRNAs; e.g., by using appropriate cationic aminolipids. 37 In the present study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of LNPmediated delivery of anti-adenoviral siRNA to the liver for treatment of hAd5 infection in vivo. Initial experiments revealed that two siRNAs, sipTP mod and siPol-1 mod , targeting the adenoviral pTP or Pol gene, which contained 2\u02b9-O-methyl residues, phosphorothioate linkages, and an optimized thermodynamic profile, efficiently inhibited hAd5 infection in vitro. For in vivo use, sipTP mod was encapsulated in LNPs containing the cationic aminolipid XL-10 (LNP-sipTP mod ) and applied concomitantly with hAd5 to immunosuppressed Syrian hamsters. This treatment resulted in distinct inhibition of hAd5 replication in the liver, reduction of hepatic inflammation, normalization of liver transaminase levels, as well as reduction of hAd titers in the blood serum compared with hAd5-infected animals that received a nonsilencing control siRNA (LNP-siContr mod ).",

LNP technology has been employed for treating various diseases in clinical practice [107][108][109][110]. The LNP delivery system could encapsulate siRNA targeting specific genes, enter cells through endosomes, and release siRNA into the cytoplasm [111]. For the successful delivery of nucleic acid into livers, LNPs are bound to ApoE protein which recognizes LDLR, a highly expressed receptor in hepatocytes [112,113]. Our team has recently utilized this platform to deliver siRNA targeting m6A-modified ARHGEF2 in mice CRC xenograft models. The results demonstrated that LNP-siARHGEF2 significantly suppressed tumor growth and metastasis in vivo, implying the therapeutic potential of LNP-siRNA for cancer patients [79]. However, the safety and efficacy of the LNP-siRNA targeting regulators of RNA modification for treating cancer should be further explored.",

            "text": "After 1 h, DY-635 was mainly eliminated through the hepatobiliary system as indicated by the stained gall bladder and gastrointestinal lumen (Fig 2G). \n\nThe liver consists of various cell types controlling metabolism and the immune response. Kupffer cells (the liver macrophage population) and liver-specific endothelial cells (LSECs) have been shown to sequester nanocarriers (Press et al, 2014;Tavares et al, 2017;Campbell et al, 2018). Both cell types would be considered \"off-target\" for our delivery strategy since they strongly contribute to the immune response against invading microorganisms. Therefore, cell-type-specific targeting of loaded liposomes within the liver was further investigated by time-lapse intravital microscopy (Fig 2 H). This method enables differentiation of parenchymal (hepatocytes) and non-parenchymal (Kupffer cells, LSECs) within the liver due to their different shape, location, and NAD(P)H fluorescence. After intravenous injection, T-LipoAS started to appear in the capillary system (sinusoids;Fig 2H). T-LipoAS then rapidly accumulated within hepatocytes. Clearance of nanocarriers by Kupffer cells or LSECs can be identified with this method via monitoring of lineshaped patterns or spots at the interphase between NADPH-positive hepatocytes and the sinusoids (Guidolin & Zheng, 2019;Cinar et al, 2020). No signal of T-LipoAS accumulated at these locations. The appearance of line structures within the hepatocytes indicates the accumulation of DY-635 in bile canaliculi, the microscopic structure formed by hepatocytes within the bile drainage pathway, further confirming the hepatobiliary elimination of DY-635. The apparent absence of DY-635 fluorescence associated with non-parenchymal cells in the liver in combination with the appearance of DY-635 derived from T-LipoAS within hepatocytes and canaliculi indicates a highly selective uptake and processing of targeted nanocarriers through hepatocytes.",

LSECs participate in liver metabolism, clearance of pathological agents, immunological responses, architectural maintenance of the liver and synthesis of growth factors and cytokines. LSECs also play an important role in coagulation through the synthesis of Factor VIII (FVIII). Herein, we phenotypically define human LSECs isolated from fetal liver using flow cytometry and immunofluorescence microscopy. Isolated LSECs were cultured and shown to express endothelial markers and markers specific for the LSEC lineage. LSECs were also shown to engraft the liver when human fetal liver cells were transplanted into immunodeficient mice with liver specific expression of the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) transgene (uPA-NOG mice). Engrafted cells expressed human Factor VIII at levels approaching those found in human plasma. We also demonstrate engraftment of adult LSECs, as well as hepatocytes, transplanted into uPA-NOG mice. We propose that overexpression of uPA provides beneficial conditions for LSEC engraftment due to elevated expression of the angiogenic cytokine, vascular endothelial growth factor. This work provides a detailed characterization of human midgestation LSECs, thereby providing the means for their purification and culture based on their expression of CD14 and CD32 as well as a lack of CD45 expression. The uPA-NOG mouse is shown to be a permissive host for human LSECs and adult hepatocytes, but not fetal hepatoblasts. Thus, these mice provide a useful model system to study these cell types in vivo. Demonstration of human FVIII production by transplanted LSECs encourages further pursuit of LSEC transplantation as a cellular therapy for the treatment of hemophilia A.",

            "text": "The lion's share of various LNPs gets distributed to the liver and to a lesser extent to the spleen, and the reason is the presence of a sinusoidal discontinuous endothelium with pores of a ~100-200 nm diameter in these organs (Kumar et al., 2023). After intravenous administration and entry into the bloodstream, a protein corona forms on the surface of LNPs, and this topic is investigated in detail in Dilliard et al. (2021). The protein corona is capable of influencing the biodistribution of nanoparticles among tissues in various organs owing to the adsorption of the proteins on the tissue surface, leading to internalization via specific receptors. The best-studied mechanism of targeting of LNPs involves their uptake by hepatocytes via binding to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors on their surface (Paunovska et al., 2022). The ApoE protein present in blood plasma is a ligand of LDL receptors and binds to cholesterol on the nanoparticles' surface and ensures their predominant accumulation in liver cells (Paunovska et al., 2022;Da Silva Sanchez et al., 2022). This mechanism is confirmed by experimental data where LNPs incubated with ApoE have been found to be targeted to hepatocytes (Johnson et al., 2022); on the other hand, particles with a protein corona composed of albumin are distributed preferentially into Kupffer cells instead of hepatocytes (Johnson et al., 2022). Overall, the delivery of LNPs into cells by an ApoE-independent mechanism leads to their accumulation in cells other than hepatocytes (Wadhera et al., 2016). A decrease in the proportion of cholesterol also impairs the delivery of LNPs to hepatocytes (Kawaguchi et al., 2023). Because of the fairly widespread expression of LDL receptor in human tissues (https:// www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000130164-LDLR/tissue),",

Moreover, lipid NPs carrying procollagen \u03b1 I(I) siRNA remarkably reduced the total hepatic collagen content, leading to an alleviation of NASH progression and accelerating the regression of hepatic fibrosis in CCL4-induced NASH in Balb/c mice [191]. In another attempt, CXCR4-targeted lipid-based NPs carrying VEGF siRNA were used for the treatment of liver fibrosis and hepatic cellular carcinoma; a combination therapy using both AMD-NPs (CXCR4 inhibitor) and VEGF siRNA abolished the infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages and reduced HCC tumor growth [192]. Apart from the above-mentioned methods, the use of quantum dot (QD) nanoparticles (1-20 nm) for the treatment of NAFLD has also emerged as an area of great interest [193]. An intravenous injection of mercaptosuccinic acid (MSA)-capped cadmium telluride/cadmium sulfide (CdTe/CdS/QDs) showed that negatively charged QDs were selectively taken up by sinusoidal cells (KCs and LSECs) in rat liver, indicating that CdTe/CdS/QDs can be used for drug delivery to the LSECs [194]. Furthermore, Zn-labelled CdSelenide/CdS/ZnS QDs were also found in the KCs and LSECs 2h after an intravenous injection of polymer-coated Qdots, indicating their efficiency in drug delivery to the sinusoidal cells [195].",

            "text": "L ipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are clinically relevant delivery systems that have delivered mRNA-based COVID vaccines after intramuscular administration, 1,2 mRNA and single-guide RNA 3,4 to hepatocytes after intravenous administration, and siRNA to hepatocytes after intravenous administration. 5 These data justify the exploration of LNPs that target nonliver tissues. 6 Scientists use three approaches to increase nonliver mRNA delivery. One is to pretreat animals with drugs that block the liver from taking up LNPs 7 or reduce the activity of mRNA once it reaches hepatocytes. 8,9 A second is to add active targeting ligands to nanoparticles. 10 For example, mRNA-loaded LNPs were targeted to Ly6c + leukocytes utilizing antibodies that were anchored into the lipid membrane. 11 In another example, plasmalemma vesicleassociated protein-targeting LNPs were covalently conjugated with antibodies, which increased lung protein expression. 12 A third approach is to change the chemical composition of the LNP. Clinical LNPs have consisted of four components: an ionizable or cationic lipid, a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-lipid, a cholesterol, and a helper lipid. For example, when a cationic helper lipid was added to a liver-targeting LNP, it was redirected to lung endothelial cells. 13 In another example, RNA-lipoplexes were targeted to lymphoid-resident dendritic cells by titrating negative charge. 14 Finally, a fifth charged molecule was added to the LNP, improving tropism to the spleen and lung. 15 Notably, authors subsequently reported that these LNPs can bind different serum proteins, providing an insight into the biology of delivery. 16 These studies led us to hypothesize that changing the helper lipid could affect the internal cellular response to LNPs in vivo. \n\nWe first confirmed helper lipid-dependent tropism. We used a functional in vivo mRNA and DNA barcode system 17\u221220 to evaluate how 18 helper lipids affected tropism to 19 cell types in vivo.",

            "text": "An intravenous injection of mercaptosuccinic acid (MSA)-capped cadmium telluride/cadmium sulfide (CdTe/CdS/QDs) showed that negatively charged QDs were selectively taken up by sinusoidal cells (KCs and LSECs) in rat liver, indicating that CdTe/CdS/QDs can be used for drug delivery to the LSECs [194]. Furthermore, Zn-labelled CdSelenide/CdS/ZnS QDs were also found in the KCs and LSECs 2h after an intravenous injection of polymer-coated Qdots, indicating their efficiency in drug delivery to the sinusoidal cells [195]. In addition, via the usage of nanoparticles carrying honokiol or adenovirus with the endothelial-cell-specific arginylglycylaspartic acid-roundabout guidance receptor 4 (RGD-ROBO4), ERK1/2 activation was promoted, leading to induced liver regeneration and reduced hepatic fibrosis due to high degree of LSEC specificity [196]. \n\nThe main studies targeting endothelial dysfunction in animal models of NAFLD/NASH/cirrhosis are summarized in Table 1. as demonstrated by reduced ALT and AST serum and decreased hepatic alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) expression [190]. Moreover, lipid NPs carrying procollagen \u03b1 I(I) siRNA remarkably reduced the total hepatic collagen content, leading to an alleviation of NASH progression and accelerating the regression of hepatic fibrosis in CCL4-induced NASH in Balb/c mice [191]. In another attempt, CXCR4-targeted lipid-based NPs carrying VEGF siRNA were used for the treatment of liver fibrosis and hepatic cellular carcinoma; a combination therapy using both AMD-NPs (CXCR4 inhibitor) and VEGF siRNA abolished the infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages and reduced HCC tumor growth [192].",

            "text": "RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutics are an emerging class of innovative medicines that offer the potential to potently and specifically reduce the expression of disease-causing genes, including those which are currently considered \"undruggable\" with small molecule or monoclonal antibody modalities. The key to fulfilling this potential is the safe and efficacious delivery of shortinterfering RNAs (siRNAs), the molecules that mediate RNAi, to specific cell types and tissues. In recent years, significant progress has been made to overcome some of the obstacles associated with in vivo delivery of siRNA, and lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) represent one of the most advanced technological platforms. 1 Earlier work has established that siRNAs formulated in LNPs can successfully silence therapeutically relevant genes in nonhuman primates, 2,3 and a class of LNPs, termed \"stable nucleic acid lipid particles\", is being utilized in multiple liver-targeted RNAi programs in human clinical trials. More recently, we reported the discovery of novel ionizable 4 and cationic 5 lipids with significantly improved activity for next generation LNP-siRNA delivery systems. The discovery of both ionizable and cationic classes of lipids that mediate efficient LNP delivery of siRNA warrants the distinction of ionizable LNPs (iLNPs) and cationic LNPs (cLNPs).\n\nThe relative success of LNPs for liver delivery of siRNA molecules can, at least in part, be attributed to the favorable physiology of the liver, a well-perfused organ with a fenestrated endothelium. On the other hand, LNPs are known to interact with serum proteins, exchanging components and acquiring proteins in circulation that can potentially direct LNPs to specific cell types. 6,7 Apolipoproteins, for instance, were found to be generally adsorbed onto neutral liposomes, but only apolipoprotein E (apoE) was capable of enhancing uptake into hepatoma cells and primary hepatocytes. 8 More recently, Yan et al. have described the role of apoE in the clearance of neutral liposomes by hepatocytes in vivo. 9 ApoE is found on ch",

Additionally, tests with erythropoietin mRNA showed higher protein production levels in the fetal liver with delivery by A-3 LNPs in the short term, while B-4 LNPs led to higher levels in the long term. Minimal differences in survival were observed in C57BL/6 and Balb/c mouse strains treated with the various LNPs [119]. \n\nIn a study by Lee's team, FLuc mRNA delivery with the 246C10 LNP, which features a piperidine head and four hydroxyl groups (Table 2), led to a 400-fold increase in FLuc expression in serum-free culture medium. Furthermore, anti-LDLR antibodies were applied to impede 246C10 LNP cellular uptake, and a significant inhibitory effect was observed. Intravenous administration of 246C10 LNP to mice revealed that the highest luciferase expression could be observed in the liver. Finally, the authors found that adjusting the proportions of PEGlipid did not effectively target liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), but the addition of glucose-PEG resulted in efficient LSEC targeting [120]. \n\nSong's team developed a series of 4N4T ionizable lipids tailored for delivery of mRNA for the full-length S protein of SARS-CoV-2. The lipids are designated as \"4N\" to represent the four tertiary amine nitrogen atoms and \"4 T\" for the four hydrophobic tails. The lipids were evaluated in terms of antigen-presenting cell (APC) S protein expression levels, with MIC1/MIC2 showing the best performance (Table 2). The superior efficacy of MIC1/MIC2 may stem from their multi-charged nature and higher amine to phosphate ratio, which facilitates efficient endosomal escape of LNPs. In vitro experiments demonstrated excellent expression of the encapsulated mRNA, and in vivo experiments demonstrated excellent safety profiles [121]. \n\nThe ether analogue HEAH (Table 3) was developed as a more stable alternative to ALC-0315 LNPs, as it showed enhanced stability after storage at 37 \u00b0C for 1 month.",

            "text": "To date, the liver, lung, and spleen are commonly targeted organs in current research, however, targeting other organs such as the eyes, skin, heart, and brain holds great potential but remains more challenging in clinical applications. \n\nDespite the translation potential, most LNPs tend to accumulate in the liver, and overcoming the natural liver targeting characteristics of LNPs has become a key challenge in nano-vector research. Recently, Sahay group developed LNPs decorated with an oligomer peptide to deliver mRNA to neural retina in rodents and non-human primates after intravitreal administration. This breakthrough demonstrates the potential of LNP-mRNA in the treatment of inherited retinal diseases and represents significant progress in LNP penetrating biological barriers to achieve extrahepatic targeting [138]. Xue et al. synthesized a series of LNPs with bisphosphonate (BP)-lipid, which showed higher affinity for bone-related fragments in vitro and higher bone-targeting in vivo compared to LNPs without BP-lipid [139]. Another example of extrahepatic targeting involves decorating LNPs with CD5 antibody to produce CAR T cells transiently by delivering mRNA to target T cells. In a mouse model of heart disease, the targeted-LNPs encapsulating modified-mRNA could reduce the fibrosis degree of heart and restore heart function [140]. \n\nThe skin is the largest organ in the human body and skin aging is related closely to the fibroblast in dermis. Recently, Francisco and Ferreira designed hundreds of polymers and selected six polymers with similar chemical structures composed of diacrylate, special amine, and bisacrylamide, which could transfect mouse fibroblasts with high efficiency in vitro. Among them, P1E28 containing alkyl alcohol side chain and piperazine rings with two tertiary amines showed the highest transfected efficiency. In vivo results showed that P1E28 polymeric nanoparticles delivered Cre mRNA to skin dermal fibroblasts with a higher delivery efficiency than endothelial cells, keratinocytes and macrophages.",

            "text": "In contrast to passive targeting, active targeting uses specific components for conjunction, such as antibodies, proteins, peptides, aptamers, carbohydrates, and vitamins that will target a receptor on the cell s membrane [163,164]. \n\nThe liver is a complex vital organ composed of two primary cell types: parenchymal and non-parenchymal cells. Most metabolic functions of the liver are performed by hepatocytes and cholangiocytes, which constitute 60-70% of the parenchymal cells. The remaining 30-40% of liver cells are non-parenchymal cells, including LSECs, HSCs, and KCs, that play essential roles in the liver s physiological processes. The development of cell-specific transport systems is necessary to enhance drug efficacy and reduce drug toxicity (Table 3). \n\nHepatocytes have a major role in MASLD and MASH progression; thus, hepatocytetargeting NPs are meaningful. Targeting hepatocytes for drug delivery is challenging due to the lack of specific surface receptors for the binding of antibodies or peptides. However, this problem can be solved by mimicking natural nanocomplexes, such as lipoproteins, to create hepatocyte-directed nanomedicines. Lipopeptide NPs show remarkable efficiency in targeting and delivering siRNAs to hepatocytes in vivo [165]. This delivery system is more efficient than non-parenchymal cells and exhibits the potential to revolutionize the treatment of liver diseases. Asialoglycoprotein receptors and glycyrrhizin, which are hepatocyte-specific ligands, are used for targeted drug delivery in vivo [166][167][168]. pHlabile PEGylated lipid NPs with N-acetylgalactosamine modifications interact with asialoglycoprotein receptors for active liver targeting [169]. This approach also facilitated the targeted delivery of Lactosylated-poly 2-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate NPs in mouse models of MASLD, reducing disease pathology [170].",

            "text": "In contrast, more sterically hindered lipids, e.g., DLin-MC3-DMA and ALC-0315, exhibited slower degradation, resulting in prolonged liver retention. \n\nAnother example is the use of SORT nanoparticles to enhance targeted mRNA delivery to organs, such as the liver, spleen, and lungs. 65 y adding a fifth \"SORT molecule\" (e.g., 18PA for spleen targeting and DOTAP for lung targeting) to the conventional four-component LNP, modifications in chemical composition have been shown to affect biodistribution. For liver-specific targeting, the addition of an ionizable cationic lipid, e.g., DODAP, has been shown to enhance liver accumulation. The SORT LNP mechanism uses serum protein adsorption, where proteins (e.g., ApoE) can bind to the nanoparticle surface and mediate uptake by target cells, such as hepatocytes via LDL receptors or through other tissue-specific pathways, depending on the recruited proteins. \n\nThe mechanism of tissue-specific targeting of SORT LNPs is illustrated in Figure 4. This proposed three-step consists of (1) desorption of PEG lipids from the nanoparticle surface, (2) binding of specific plasma proteins to the exposed SORT molecules, and (3) receptormediated uptake in target tissues. The figure shows how modifying the PEG-lipid properties (e.g., using less-sheddable PEG lipids like C18-PEG2K) significantly reduces targeting efficiency, as demonstrated by decreased bioluminescence in target organs. Additionally, the plasma protein binding profiles shown in the figure emphasize how the molecular structure of SORT molecules influences the protein corona composition and isoelectric point distribution, directly affecting organ-specific biodistribution. 65 SORT nanoparticles also can be designed to selectively edit therapeutically relevant cell types such as epithelial cells, endothelial cells, B cells, T cells, and hepatocytes, using various gene-editing modalities, e.g., mRNA, Cas9 mRNA/single guide RNA, and Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complexes. 66",

Targeting the fibrogenic programs in aHSC is central to combat fibrosis in NASH. \n\nHSCs also have distinct receptors on plasma membrane that are suitable for targeting. For instance, sigma-1 receptor (Sig-1R) as an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone protein, is selectively expressed on the surface of aHSC upon chronic ER stress [39,40] (See section 3.2 for details). Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) are highly differentiated endothelial cells that lack basement membrane while retaining the fenestrae. They modulate liver homeostasis by eliminating lipid and lipoproteins in the circulation via receptor-mediated endocytosis [41]. Dysfunction of LSEC drives NASH pathogenesis by producing proinflammatory chemokines, recruiting leukocytes to liver parenchyma via interaction with their adhesion molecules and finally aggravating hepatic inflammation and NASH [42]. Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR3) binds to its ligand, vascular endothelial growth factor D and blocks VE-Cadherin upregulation, improving lymphatic permeability upon oxidized low-density lipoprotein treatment [43]. It is exclusively expressed in LSEC cells [44], indicating it as an ideal receptor for LSEC targeting delivery. The cell-type specificity of ligand-receptor-interaction-based delivery strategies is summarized in Table 1. The comparison of the uptake efficiency, and challenges of specific delivery are summarized in Table 2.",

Data regarding the biodistribution of polymers, polymer lipids, and lipid nanoparticles indicate that the internal and external nanoparticle charges are one of the most influential factors for selective organ and tissue tropism of nanostructured LNPs [149][150][151][152][153].

            "text": "These NPs accumulated in the liver and exerted therapeutic activity in HCC models, which was associated with decreased TAM numbers and the attenuated infiltration of PMN-related MDSCs but enhanced CTL infiltration. In a combination approach, LNPs coated with mannose for TAM targeting were co-loaded with a NF-\u03baB inhibitor to reprogram TAMs and with a PD-1-blocking antibody to enhance T effector cell proliferation [212] into nanogels that released their content in a matrix metalloproteinase 2-responsive manner at the tumor site [163]. Further strategies to reprogram and deplete TAMs in HCC have recently been reviewed [231]. \n\nIn HCC both the loss of LSEC fenestration and the accumulating ECM may prevent drug delivery to the tumor site. Simvastatin has been demonstrated to restore LSEC capillarization by activating the transcription factor Kruppel-like factor (KLF)2 [232]. KLF2, in turn, activated endothelial nitric oxide synthase and the derived NO triggered soluble guanylyl cyclase-dependent signaling [233]. Yu and coworkers demonstrated in a murine HCC model that PLGA-based NPs loaded with simvastatin and coated with mannose to target LSECs reverted LSEC capillarization and deactivated HSCs [99]. Moreover, simvastatin induced the production of the chemokine CXCL16 by LSECs, which attracted natural killer T cells that exerted anti-tumor activity. Lipid calcium-phosphate NPs, which were conjugated with aminoethyl anisamide suggested to engage the sigma-1 receptor found to be highly expressed by activated HSCs [234], delivered plasmid DNA encoding the anti-fibrotic peptide, relaxin [100], thereby reverting fibrosis within the tumor lesion [235]. Synergistic anti-tumor effects were achieved when combining this approach with a PD-L1 blockade. Further studies on nanodrug delivery to HSCs and the relevance of these strategies to address closely related CAFs are discussed by Kaps and Schuppan [236].",

Bellinger utilized multivalent N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) to interact with highly expressed asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) on the hepatocytes, mediating an endogenous entry mechanism. 33 An optimized GalNAc-modified LNPs formulated by ionizable lipid GL6 based on the lysine-based scaffold and covalently linked to the sugar moiety and scaffold exhibited significant adenine base editing capability targeting ANGPTL3 in the liver in a somatic LDLR-deficient nonhuman primates (NHP) model. The GalNAc-LNPs increased liver editing from 5% to 61% in the NHP model and resulted in an 89% reduction in ANGPTL3 protein in the blood for 6 months after administration. 34 Besides, O-series LNPs (ILs containing an ester bond in the tail) have shown a preference for accomplishing liver-selective mRNA delivery. 35 Qiaobing Xu's team developed a novel O-series LNPs, 306-O12B LNPs, to perform a specific hepatocyte delivery of Cas9 (CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats)-associated protein 9) mRNA and single guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting ANGPTL3 (sgAngptl3). 36 n spite of the fact that the ability of LNPs to target hepatocytes has been widely explored, the targeted delivery of LNPs to other liver cells, such as HSCs, hepatic macrophages, Kupffer cells (KCs), and LSECs, remains a challenge. Fortunately, several studies have shown that strategies for targeting other hepatic cells with LNPs are possible. In the recent past, one approach, and also the most common one, has been the use of lipid library screening, which allows for the identification of structurally analogous targeting lipid candidates or the discovery of new structure-activity relationships.",

The endothelial cells in the sinusoids are discontinuous, with their primary function being filtration. They lack an organized basement membrane and function in partner with tissue resident macrophages, called Kupffer cells, to remove wastes, ECs doing so mainly through endocytosis (11,18). Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) represent a heterogenous population, with distinct phenotypes in different zones of the liver, as each zone is its own unique microenvironment (142). As the liver is a key immune organ, LSECs can present antigens to both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells via MHC Class I and II molecules [reviewed in (143,144)]. Interactions between LSECs and T cells can decrease T cell activation, preventing autoimmune dysfunction throughout the body. Traditional transmigration is not always necessary for immune cell surveillance. In some instances, T cells can pass through the LSEC gaps and directly contact hepatocytes, or contact hepatocytes without crossing the LSEC barrier by contacting the hepatocyte protrusions through the fenestrations (145). Leukocytes are recruited and infiltrate the liver sinusoids in several disease condition, including hepatitis and sepsis (29). While the liver has post-capillary venules, leukocyte migration primarily occurs in the sinusoidal capillaries and does not require selectins (29, 146). However, expression of E-selectin by a small percentage of LSECs was detected in Kupffer cell (resident liver macrophages)-depleted mice and serves to recruit monocytes that replenish the Kupffer cell population (147). Another unique aspect of liver sinusoidal TEM is that junctional adhesion molecule-A (JAM-A), rather than PECAM-1, is necessary for transmigration (148, 149). LSECs also express baseline levels of ICAM-1 and vascular adhesion protein-1 (VAP-",

Furthermore, it has been shown that most vertebrates carry their so-called scavenger endothelial cells (endothelial cells endowed with the same RES-function as rat LSEC) in organs other than liver [9]. These findings justify a careful study to determine whether the liver of pig is equipped with the same type of scavenger LSEC that is present in rat liver.\n\nWith the motivation to determine if pig liver contains LSEC that resemble rat LSEC, we set out to study the scavenger function of pig LSEC. Although some laboratories have reported on isolation of pig liver sinusoidal cells, those methods either yield very low purity or a very low cell number [10,11]. For this reason, we established a protocol consisting of collagenase perfusion, differential and density centrifugation, and centrifugal elutriation. This method yields both high purity and functionally intact pig liver sinusoidal cells that can be cultivated in monolayer cultures. Notably, the yield of sinusoidal cells was four orders of magnitude higher with the presently described method compared to a recently reported protocol [10]. With this method we show, for the first time, that pig LSEC are as endocytically active as their rat liver counterparts.",

            "text": "RNA therapy relies on cytosolic delivery of exogenous (therapeutic) RNA molecules, e.g., messenger RNA (mRNA), small interefering RNA (siRNA), or microRNA (miRNA), to gain precise control of gene expression within target cells. [1,2] This requires delivery systems to protect, transport, and deliver highly charged, immunogenic, and membrane impermeable RNA payloads within target cells and tissues in the body. To this end, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have emerged as the leading nonviral RNA delivery system for systemic in vivo application. [3][4][5] These technologies are exemplified by Onpattro, a clinically approved LNP-based RNA interference therapy, administered intravenously (i.v.) and used to treat polyneuropathies resulting from transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (hATTR)). [6,7] Onpattro functions by transiently silencing transthyretin expression specifically within hepatocytes through siRNA delivery. [7] Hepatocyte targeting is mediated through the adsorption of soluble apolipoprotein E (apoE) onto the surface of a circulating LNP. [8,9] Once bound, apoE promotes LNP binding to the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLr) [10] that is heavily expressed on the sinusoidal surface of hepatocytes. ApoE-LDLr binding leads to LNP endocytosis and consequent cytosolic siRNA delivery. Cytosolic siRNA release is enhanced by the protonation of ionizable (cationic) lipids within the endosome and subsequent disruption of the endosomal membrane. [11] Following systemic administration, harnessing apoE-mediated LNP specificity for the delivery of RNA therapeutics (siRNA or mRNA) to hepatocytes is relatively common. [5,10,[12][13][14][15] However, expanding the scope of LNP-based gene therapies to other hepatic cell types (or nonhepatic cells), and therefore gain access to many tissue-",

            "text": "Indeed, adding increasingly higher percentages of permanently positively charged 1,2-dioleoyl-3trimethylammonium-propane lipid (DOTAP) shifted tissue tropism from the liver to the lungs. Based on that outcome, researchers tested numerous other molecules with different charges, including a negatively charged 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (18PA) SORT molecule that, at 10-40% incorporation in an LNP formulation, resulted in spleen-specific Luc expression. Incorporating SORT molecules, including DLin-MC3-DMA which was used in Patisiran [51], into several classes of ionizable LNPs produced similar outcomes, indicating this system is compatible with commonly used ionizable lipid-LNPs and can be altered according to therapeutic goals [74]. These same authors recently published another study, where they created multi-tailed ionizable phospholipids (iPhos) that facilitated endosomal release of RNA cargo. These lipids can function together with additional variously charged helper lipids to allow organ-specific delivery, an approach similar to the SORT system [78]. \n\nIn addition to organ-specific delivery, researchers have pursued targeting specific cell subsets in the liver by engineering ionizable lipid nanoparticles for selective RNA delivery into hepatocytes and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC). For hepatocytespecific delivery, the authors manipulated particle size by adjusting PEG content, whereas incorporating mannose favored targeted LSEC RNA delivery [79]. \n\nOne of the most therapeutically important targets for gene delivery is tumor tissue. Cancer remains the main cause of death worldwide, accounting for nearly 10 million deaths in 2020 [80] and various gene therapy applications, including RNA-based approaches [81], have been employed for cancer treatment in pre-clinical trials. However, as with traditional chemotherapy, the main concern remains targeted delivery to tumor tissue. To meet this challenge, a LNP-mRNA delivery system was designed to deliver CRISPR components (cLNP) into glioblastoma and disseminated ovarian tumors [82].",

            "text": "The endothelialization of parenchymal sinusoids is of equal importance to covering the macrovascular lumen, given that they form a barrier between sinusoidal blood and hepatocytes. This is particularly important if the parenchyma of transplanted reendothelialized liver grafts is also repopulated with hepatocytes. Direct contact between hepatocytes and blood is known to cause an instant blood-mediated inflammatory reaction (IBMIR), in which inflammatory cells, including monocytes, granulocytes, and natural killer (NK) cells, are activated and cause inflammation. The occurrence of IBMIR can be prevented by an endothelial lining of the sinusoids in decellularized liver scaffolds. However, difficulties related to isolation and large-scale in vitro expansion of primary LSECs hamper their use in liver recellularization studies [85]. \n\nStem/Progenitor Cell-Derived Endothelial-like Cells Generation of endothelial-like cells from hiPSCs has been described using various differentiation protocols [86]. In addition, some studies showed that it might be possible to transform such iPsc endothelial cells to an LSEC phenotype via modification, TGF\u03b2 pathway inhibition, or genetic engineering [87][88][89]. These hiPSC-derived LSECs may be good candidates to cover the sinusoidal endothelial lining of the liver parenchyma. However, as Shaheen et al. found that HUVECs gain the expression of LYVE-1 when present in sinusoids in the liver parenchyma [84], it is also possible that grafting hiPSCderived endothelial cells not previously connected to LSECs might undergo a phenotype shift from a macrovascular-to a sinusoidal endothelial-like phenotype when they engraft in liver sinusoids. \n\nFrom the perspective of whole organ recellularization studies, the minimal endothelial cell requirements would be that they can cover the lumen of the vascular tract, show angiogenic behavior, and maintain viability on the long term.",

            "text": "Aging is associated with gradual changes in liver structure and physiological/pathological functions in hepatic cells including hepatocytes, cholangiocytes, Kupffer cells, hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). LSECs are specialized hepatic endothelial cells that regulate liver homeostasis. These cells actively impact the hepatic microenvironment as they have fenestrations and a thin morphology to allow substance exchange between circulating blood and the liver tissue. As aging occurs, LSECs have a reduction in both the number and size of fenestrations, which is referred to as pseudocapillarization. This along with the aging of the liver leads to increased oxidative stress, decreased availability of nitric oxide, decreased hepatic blood flow, and increased inflammatory cytokines in LSECs. Vascular aging can also lead to hepatic hypoxia, HSC activation, and liver fibrosis. In this review, we described the basic structure of LSECs, and the effect of LSECs on hepatic inflammation and fibrosis during aging process. We briefly summarized the changes of hepatic microcirculation during liver inflammation, the effect of aging on the clearance function of LSECs, the interactions between LSECs and immunity, hepatocytes or other hepatic nonparenchymal cells, and the therapeutic intervention of liver diseases by targeting LSECs and vascular system. Since LSECs play an important role in the development of liver fibrosis and the changes of LSEC phenotype occur in the early stage of liver fibrosis, the study of LSECs in the fibrotic liver is valuable for the detection of early liver fibrosis and the early intervention of fibrotic response.",

            "text": "A number of recent studies have demonstrated that LNP systems accumulate in various cell types within the liver [49,50,143,159]. Important physicochemical characteristics that modulate intrahepatic LNP distribution and activity are particle size, apparent pKa value (and resulting surface charge), and lipase sensitivity [159]. For clinical utility, it is also expected that these formulations display high entrapment efficiencies.\n\nA recent study by Chen et al. investigated how LNP size (30 nm -120 nm) influences gene silencing in hepatocytes [153]. A clear hierarchy in gene silencing potency was observed with LNP-siRNA systems around 80 nm exhibiting maximum activity (78 nm > 42 nm > 38 nm >> 27 nm > 117 nm). This LNP size optimum results from a combination of two factors: 1) smaller particles being less active (less stable and less fusogenic); and 2) larger particles (>100 nm), not being able to access hepatocytes (limited by fenestrations). Sato et al. verified these results demonstrating significant reduction in hepatocyte gene silencing for LNP-siRNA sizes above the average liver fenestrae diameters [159]. Interestingly, similar gene silencing activity in LSECs was observed for LNP-siRNA sizes up to 200 nm. This suggests that LNP sizes between 120 nm to 200 nm could be used for LSEC targeting.\n\nA key advance during the development of Onpattro\u00ae for hepatocyte gene silencing was identifying an optimized ionizable cationic lipid with an apparent pKa between 6.2 and 6.5 [17,31]. Further increasing the pKa value to 7.15 resulted in improved gene silencing in LSECs [159,160]. Incorporating ionizable cationic lipids exhibiting higher pKa values increased accumulation in the MPS, most likely due to scavenger receptor recognition [159].\n\nThe lipid sensitivity to phospholipase is another important factor modulating intrahepatic LNP distribution and activity. Three different lipases have been described including the lipoprotein and endothelial lipase",

            "text": "Genetic medicines that are injected systemically are virtually only successful in treating diseases related to processes in hepatocytes, the parenchymal cells of the liver. While intramuscular injections such as mRNA vaccines effectively reach and instruct immune cells in muscle tissue, it remains a particular challenge to target hepatic non-parenchymal cells (NPC) with mRNA upon systemic injection. Hepatocytes have various functions, they are involved in blood filtration and endocytic uptake of lipids, growth factors, and trophic agents through specific receptors. [1] Interestingly, drugs based on lipid nanoparticles (LNP), [2] but also other carriers that are approved for gene therapy exert their way of action via hepatocytes. [3] hile hepatocytes are a recognized target for genetic medicines, the introduction of mRNA to Kupffer cells (KC) could pave the way for new therapeutic strategies. This is because these cells are key NPC that process immune system-related responses and thereby play a crucial role in regulating tolerance and anti-tumor immunity. [4] In recent years, LNP formulations were designed to increase the accumulation of synthetic RNA in hepatic NPC: one attempt included replacing the helper lipid 1,2-distearoyl-snglycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC) with 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (DSPG). [5] Others have reported that LNP containing piperazine-based ionizable lipids increase absorption by NPC and, especially, immune cells. [6] The successful delivery of Cre-mRNA into different NPC, particularly KC, was proven by gene deletion in different liver cells of genefloxed mice. [7] Thus, several studies suggested that hepatic macrophages such as KC translate synthetic mRNA at detectable levels. [5,7,8] owever, an examination of the longitudinal protein translation by NPC in real-time remains an unmet need in the field.",

Here, we establish an efficient, safe, non-integrative method to transiently express hepatocyte-growth-factor (HGF) and epidermal-growth-factor (EGF) in hepatocytes via nucleoside-modified, lipid-nanoparticle-encapsulated mRNA (mRNA-LNP) delivery in mice. We confirm specific hepatotropism of mRNA-LNP via intravenous injection of firefly luciferase encoding mRNA-LNP, with protein expression lasting about 3 days. In the liver, virtually all hepatocytes are transfected along with a subpopulation of endothelial and Kupffer cells. In homeostasis, HGF mRNA-LNP efficiently induce hepatocyte proliferation. In a chronic liver injury mouse model recapitulating non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, injections of both HGF and EGF mRNA-LNP sharply reverse steatosis and accelerate restoration of liver function. Likewise, HGF and EGF mRNA-LNP accelerate liver regeneration after acetaminophen-induced acute liver injury with rapid return to baseline ALT levels. This study introduces mRNA-LNP as a potentially translatable safe therapeutic intervention to harness liver regeneration via controlled expression of endogenous mitogens in vivo. When severely or chronically injured, the liver loses ability to regenerate. Here, the authors utilize transient lipid nanoparticle-enclosed HGF and EGF-encoding mRNA delivery to induce hepatocyte proliferation and harness recovery of liver function in murine acute and chronic liver injury models.",

In this report, the authors speculated that in mice with lost fenestrae, chylomicron remnants which were required for VLDL synthesis, were trapped in the circulation and could no longer reach the hepatocytes, causing compensatory de novo lipogenesis by hepatocytes, resulting in hepatic steatosis (Figure 2). However, the exact mechanisms of how LSEC capillarization contributes to hepatic steatosis have not been clearly elucidated. \n\nHence, these reports suggest that excess lipid intake and gut dysbiosis might induce LSEC capillarization, which in turn promotes hepatic steatosis, creating a vicious cycle, although the detailed molecular mediators are an area ripe for further investigation (Figure 2).

In the hepatocytes, triglycerides (TG) carried by chylomicron remnants are used for very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) synthesis. In addition, LSEC endocytosis mediated by the trans-membrane receptor stabilin-1 facilitates the transfer of oxidized LDL from the circulation to the hepatocytes. In NASH (B), western diet and gut microbiota-related factors induce LSEC capillarization.",

It was demonstrated that natural cholesterol analogs enhance the endosomal escape of LNPs, while the presence of natural structural lipids on nanoparticle surfaces forms a corona when dispersed in biological fluids. [187] mRNA delivery to T cells was studied by creating a vast library of LNPs. Structural analogs of immune-cell targeted ionizable lipid materials were synthesized via Michael addition chemistry. Alkyl chains terminated with epoxide groups were reacted with polyamine cores of varying lengths. Using microfluidic chips, a combination of 24 ionizable lipids, cholesterol, helper lipids, and PEG-lipids were used to encapsulate mRNA and form LNP complexes ranging from 51 to 97 nm. Screening of the process detected improved mRNA delivery for seven LNP formulations, compared to commercially available lipofectamine. No significant correlation was observed among LNP size, concentration of the genetic molecules, or the pKa of ionizable lipid with the enhanced delivery of the cargo. Furthermore, LNPs containing purified saturated ionizable lipids improved mRNA delivery over that of crude lipid formulations. [188] LNPs were also used to deliver mRNA for hemophilia treatment. In this investigation, lipid components consisting of ionizable lipid distearoylphosphatidylcholine, cholesterol, and PEG-lipid were mixed with synthesized mRNAs to synthesize mRNA LNPs. LNP complexes of sizes smaller than 100 nm, more than 80% RNA encapsulation efficiency, and less than 10 endotoxin units were obtained. Thanks to a bioluminescence signal in the liver and a weak or absence of signal in the spleen or other organs, it was suggested that LNPs efficiently delivered mRNA to the liver. Repeated injections of LNPs, however, induced the inhibitor formation of short-lived factors. [189] In the case of long-term storage of LNPs carriers, specifically COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, little is known about the physical stability of lipid nanoparticles.

Cellular uptake of adenoviral vectors after systemic gene transfer occurs predominantly in nonparenchymal liver cells (i.e. mainly liver sinusoidal endothelial cells and Kupffer cells) [28]. It was demonstrated that uptake of vectors by non-parenchymal liver cells (i.e. mainly liver sinusoidal endothelial cells and Kupffer cells) inversely correlates with transduction of parenchymal liver cells [28]. Depletion of Kupffer cells and macrophages in the liver by intravenous administration of clodronate liposomes results in significantly increased transgene DNA levels in parenchymal liver cells [28] and in increased transgene expression [28]. Besides clodronate liposomes, preadministration of polyinosinic acid, a scavenger receptor A ligand, before gene transfer has been shown to prevent sequestration of adenoviral vectors in Kupffer cells and to enhance parenchymal liver cell transduction [29]. The liver transduction we've obtained, using only 10 7 BoHV-4-based vector particles and without intervention to decrease the uptake of the vector in the liver reticulo-endotelial cells, can be considered satisfactory. This Histological examination of livers from inoculated mice indicated that BoHV-4-A-EGFPDTK the infected/transduced liver were hepatocytes and not Kupffer cells (KC) or sinusoidal endothelial cells (liver sinusoidal endothelial cell, LSEC), which are those responsible for the clearance of viral particles [17]. A possible explanation for this surprising behavior could be that the viral fraction sequestered by KC or LSEC lost the transduction ability due to inactivation by the phagocytic activity of those cells, and thus, GFP could not be expressed. Whereas the GFP expressed in the hepatocytes could derive from the remaining viral fraction that escaped KC or LSEC phagocytosis, and thus maintained infection/transduction ability.

            "text": "Wenjia Liu 1,2,3,6 , Yuting Liu 2 , Liqiang Zhang 2 , Liya Li 2 , Wenguang Yang 4 , Jia Li 2 & Wangxiao He 4,5,6 Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) lose their characteristic fenestrations and become capillarized during the progression of liver fibrosis. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation can reverse this capillarization and reduce fibrosis, but MSC therapy has practical limitations that hinder its clinical use. Here, with the help of artificial intelligence (AI), we show that MSCs secrete a microRNA (miR-325-3p) that helps restore LSEC fenestrations (tiny pores) by modulating their cytoskeleton, effectively reversing capillarization. We further develop a spherical nucleic acid (SNA) nanoparticle carrying miR-325-3p as an alternative to MSC therapy. This SNA specifically enters fibrotic LSECs via the scavenger receptor A (Scara). In three mouse models of liver fibrosis, the SNA treatment restores LSEC fenestrations, reverses capillarization, and significantly reduces fibrosis without adverse effects. Our findings highlight the potential of SNA-based therapy for liver fibrosis, paving the way for targeted nucleic acid treatments directed at LSECs and offering hope for patients. \n\nThe liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) are indispensable for maintaining the distinctive architecture and functionality of the hepatic sinusoids, which facilitate efficient blood circulation and metabolic exchange 1 . Furthermore, these specialized endothelial cells play an indispensable role in propelling the progression of liver fibrosis 2 . Within the context of this condition, LSEC undergo a transformative process known as capillarization -relinquishing their fenestrations and sieve plate structures while adopting a more dedifferentiated and profibrogenic phenotype 3 . This phenomenon called endothelial-tomesenchymal transition (EMT) intensifies the fibrotic mechanism by facilitating extracellular matrix component deposition and augmenting inflammatory cell recruitment 4,5 .",

For example, adding CD31 (PECAM) antibody to LNP can target lung endothelial cells [93]. A similar approach using VCAM ligands can successfully target LNPs to inflammatory sites in the brain and attenuated the TNF-\u03b1-induced brain edema [94]. In another study, a novel lung-targeted mRNA delivery system was developed through in vivo screening of a library of synthetic lipid nanoparticles. They demonstrated that by simply changing the head structure of LNPs, mRNA can be targeted to different lung subcellular types [95].",

            "text": "Liver fibrosis is characterized by excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) and dysfunction of sinusoidal endothelial cells following chronic liver damage (Shouval & Friedman, 2014). This condition remains a global health problem. If not timely treated, the liver parenchyma is replaced by scar tissue, causing cirrhosis or liver cancer. At present, no anti-fibrosis drugs have been approved. The frequently used drugs in clinics are ineffective due to a lack of organ selectivity and the inability to deliver sufficient drug concentration to the lesion. Additionally, a lack of liver-targeting therapies causes toxicity and side effects. Therefore, it is imperative to develop new drug delivery systems with effective targeting abilities, high accuracy, and low toxicity. \n\nNanotechnology, which enables passive targeted delivery of drugs to the liver, has attracted increasing attention in recent years (Mishra et al., 2010;Doane & Burda, 2013). Nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC) is a promising nanotechnology-based drug delivery system that potentially improves the in vivo pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of water-insoluble drugs. Compared to traditional lipid carrier delivery systems (such as SLN), the NLC demonstrates better encapsulation and stability as it comprises a mixture of solid-liquid lipids with varying melting points (M\u20ac uller et al., 2002;Shidhaye et al., 2008). However, the application of NLC in the treatment of liver diseases is limited by low hydrophilicity and lack of active targeting. \n\nBile acids are endogenous hepatocyte-specific natural ligands, actively transported to hepatocytes via Na \u00fe /taurocholate cotransporter (NTCP) on the surface of hepatocytes (Sievanen, 2007). Bile acids can serve as small molecule livertargeting carriers for oral absorption. Furthermore, bile acids contribute to human hepatoenteric circulation and demonstrate a powerful transport capability (Dawson, 2011).",

We developed a liver-targeting lipid nanoparticle (LNP) platform to deliver mRNA-encoded peanut allergen epitopes to liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), which function as robust tolerogenic antigen-presenting cells that induce FoxP3+ regulatory T-cells (Tregs). The mRNA strand was constructed by including nucleotide sequences encoding for nonallergenic MHC-II binding T-cell epitopes, identified in the dominant peanut allergen, Ara h2. These epitopes were inserted in the mRNA strand downstream of an MHC-II targeting sequence, further endowed in vitro with 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 capping sequences, a PolyA tail, and uridine substitution. Codon-optimized mRNA was used for microfluidics synthesis of LNPs with an ionizable cationic lipid, also decorated with a lipid-anchored mannose ligand for LSEC targeting. Biodistribution to the liver was confirmed by in vivo imaging, while ELISpot assays demonstrated an increase in IL-10-producing Tregs in the spleen. Prophylactic administration of tandem-repeat or a combination of encapsulated Ara h2 epitopes induced robust tolerogenic effects in C3H/HeJ mice, sensitized to and subsequently challenged with crude peanut allergen extract. In addition to alleviating physical manifestations of anaphylaxis, there was suppression of Th2-mediated cytokine production, IgE synthesis, and mast cell release, accompanied by increased IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 production in the peritoneum. Similar efficacy was demonstrated during LNP administration postsensitization. While nondecorated particles had lesser but significant effects, PolyA/LNP-Man lacked protective effects. These results demonstrate an exciting application of mRNA/LNP for treatment of food allergen anaphylaxis, with the promise to be widely applicable to the allergy field.",

With increasing age, there are marked reductions in fenestrations, referred to as pseudocapillarization. Currently, fenestrations are thought to be regulated by vascular endothelial growth factor and nitric oxide (NO) pathways promoting remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton and cell membrane lipid rafts. We investigated the effects of drugs that act on these pathways on fenestrations in old (18\u201324 mo) and young mice (3\u20134 mo). Isolated LSECs were incubated with either cytochalasin 7-ketocholesterol, sildenafil, amlodipine, simvastatin, 2, 5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI), bosentan, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) or nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN). LSECs were visualized under scanning electron microscopy to quantify fenestration porosity, diameter, and frequency, as well as direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy to examine actin and NO synthase. In young and old LSECs, fenestration porosity, diameter and frequency were increased by 7-ketocholesterol, while porosity and/or frequency were increased with NMN, sildenafil, amlodipine, TRAIL, and cytochalasin D. In old mice only, bosentan and DOI increased fenestration porosity and/or frequency. Modification of the actin cytoskeleton was observed with all agents that increased fenestrations, while NO synthase was only increased by sildenafil, amlodipine, and TRAIL. In conclusion, agents that target NO, actin, or lipid rafts promote changes in fenestrations in mice LSECs. Regulation of fenestrations occurs via both NO-dependent and independent pathways. This work indicates that age-related defenestration can be reversed pharmacologically, which has potential translational relevance for dyslipidemia and insulin resistance. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We demonstrate the effects of multiple nitric oxide-dependent and -independent pharmaceutical agents on fenestrations of the liver sinusoidal endothelium. Fenestrations are reorganized in response to nicotinamide mononucleotide, sildenafil, amlodipine, and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand.

With old age there is a loss of fenestrations referred to as pseudocapillarization which leads to hepatic insulin resistance and dyslipidemia. We are developing nanomedicines that target the LSEC in order to reverse age-related loss of fenestrations. Methods: We investigated the effects of various agents on fenestrations in old compared to young C57/Bl6 mice. Isolated mice LSECs were incubated for 30 mins with Cytochalasin D (actin disruptor), 7-ketocholesterol (lipid raft disruptor), sildenafil, amlodipine and simvastatin (NO pathway promotors), 2,5-Dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI, serotonergic agent), bosentan (endothelin receptor inhibitor), TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN, NAD+ promotor). Cells were fixed and prepared for visualization under scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM). SEM was used to examine fenestration porosity, diameter and frequency; dSTORM to examine actin and NO synthase densitometry. Results: Old LSECs (18-24 mths, n=3) had reduced fenestrations compared with young LSECs (4-6 mths, n=3). In both young and old LSECs, porosity, diameter and frequency were increased with NMN (P < 0.05); porosity and frequency only were increased by sildenafil, amlodipine, TRAIL, cytochalasin D and 7-ketocholesterol (P < 0.05). In old mice only, bosentan and DOI increased fenestration porosity and frequency (P < 0.05). Modification of the actin cytoskeleton was observed in all fenestration promoting agents with NO synthase promoted in sildenafil, amlodipine and TRAIL treatments (P < 0.05). Conclusion: We have shown that several agents and medicines targeting the NO pathway, actin and lipid raft disruption promote refenestration of aged mice LSECs to similar expression and patterns to young mice. Regulation of fenestrations may be performed by NO-dependent and independent pathways. Many of these agents demonstrate potential therapeutic use to treat age related pseudocapillarization in order to improve age-related insulin resistance and dyslipidemia.",

Prior mechanism of action studies have demonstrated selective biodistribution of ImmTOR to the spleen and liver following intravenous (IV) administration. In the spleen, ImmTOR has been shown to induce tolerogenic dendritic cells and antigen-specific regulatory T cells and inhibit antigen-specific B cell activation. Splenectomy of mice resulted in partial but incomplete abrogation of the tolerogenic immune response induced by ImmTOR. Here we investigated the ability of ImmTOR to enhance the tolerogenic environment in the liver. All the major resident populations of liver cells, including liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), Kupffer cells (KC), stellate cells (SC), and hepatocytes, actively took up fluorescent-labeled ImmTOR particles, which resulted in downregulation of MHC class II and co-stimulatory molecules and upregulation of the PD-L1 checkpoint molecule. The LSEC, known to play an important role in hepatic tolerance induction, emerged as a key target cell for ImmTOR. LSEC isolated from ImmTOR treated mice inhibited antigen-specific activation of ovalbumin-specific OT-II T cells. The tolerogenic environment led to a multi-pronged modulation of hepatic T cell populations, resulting in an increase in T cells with a regulatory phenotype, upregulation of PD-1 on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and the emergence of a large population of CD4\u2013CD8\u2013 (double negative) T cells. ImmTOR treatment protected mice in a concanavalin A-induced model of acute hepatitis, as evidenced by reduced production of inflammatory cytokines, infiltrate of activated leukocytes, and tissue necrosis. Modulation of T cell phenotype was seen to a lesser extent after administration by empty nanoparticles, but not free rapamycin. The upregulation of PD-1, but not the appearance of double negative T cells, was inhibited by antibodies against PD-L1 or CTLA-4. These results suggest that the liver may contribute to the tolerogenic properties of ImmTOR treatment.",

Prior mechanism of action studies showed selective biodistribution of ImmTOR to the spleen and liver following intravenous (IV) administration in mice. In the spleen, ImmTOR has been demonstrated to induce tolerogenic dendritic cells and antigen-specific regulatory T cells and inhibit antigen-specific B cell activation. Splenectomized mice showed a partial but incomplete abrogation of the tolerogenic immune response mediated by ImmTOR.Here we evaluated the ability of ImmTOR to enhance the tolerogenic environment in the liver.All the major resident populations of liver cells, including liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), Kupffer cells (KC), stellate cells (SC), and hepatocytes, actively took up fluorescent-labeled ImmTOR particles, which resulted in downregulation of MHC class II and co-stimulatory molecules and upregulation of the PD-L1 checkpoint molecule. The LSEC, known to play an important role in hepatic tolerance induction, emerged as a key target cell for ImmTOR. The tolerogenic environment led to a multi-pronged modulation of hepatic T cell populations, resulting in an increase in T cells with a regulatory phenotype, upregulation of PD-1 on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and the emergence of a large population of CD4\u2013CD8\u2013 (double negative) T cell population. Modulation of T cell phenotype was seen to a lesser extent after administration by empty nanoparticles, but not free rapamycin. The upregulation of PD-1, but not the appearance of double negative T cells, was inhibited by antibodies against PD-L1 or CTLA-4.These results suggest that the liver may contribute to the tolerogenic properties of ImmTOR in mitigating anti-drug antibody responses to biologic therapies, such as pegadricase.Petr Ilyinskii Shareholder of: Selecta Biosciences, Employee of: Selecta Biosciences, Christopher Roy Shareholder of: Selecta Biosciences, Employee of: Selecta Biosciences, Julie LePrevost Shareholder of: Selecta Biosciences, Employee of: Selecta Biosciences, Kei Kishimoto Shareholder of: Selecta Biosciences, Employee of: Selecta Biosciences",

Fast identification of nanoparticle delivery (FIND) is a DNA barcode\u2010based system designed to measure how over 100 lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) deliver mRNA that functions in the cytoplasm of target cells in a single mouse. By using FIND to quantify how 75 chemically distinct LNPs delivered mRNA to 28 cell types in vivo, it is found that an LNP formulated with oxidized cholesterol and no targeting ligand delivers Cre mRNA, which edits DNA in hepatic endothelial cells and Kupffer cells at 0.05 mg kg\u22121. Notably, the LNP targets liver microenvironmental cells fivefold more potently than hepatocytes. The structure of the oxidized cholesterols added to the LNP is systematically varied to show that the position of the oxidative modification may be important; cholesterols modified on the hydrocarbon tail associated with sterol ring D tend to outperform cholesterols modified on sterol ring B.

This technology not only provides new opportunities to treat liver\u2010specific and systemic diseases in which RES cell types play a key role but, more importantly, exemplifies that rational design of advanced RNA therapies must be preceded by a robust understanding of the dominant nano\u2013biointeractions involved.",

We developed a liver-targeting lipid nanoparticle (LNP) platform to deliver mRNA-encoded peanut allergen epitopes to liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), which function as robust tolerogenic antigen-presenting cells that induce FoxP3+ regulatory T-cells (Tregs). The mRNA strand was constructed by including nucleotide sequences encoding for nonallergenic MHC-II binding T-cell epitopes, identified in the dominant peanut allergen, Ara h2. These epitopes were inserted in the mRNA strand downstream of an MHC-II targeting sequence, further endowed in vitro with 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 capping sequences, a PolyA tail, and uridine substitution. Codon-optimized mRNA was used for microfluidics synthesis of LNPs with an ionizable cationic lipid, also decorated with a lipid-anchored mannose ligand for LSEC targeting. Biodistribution to the liver was confirmed by in vivo imaging, while ELISpot assays demonstrated an increase in IL-10-producing Tregs in the spleen. Prophylactic administration of tandem-repeat or a combination of encapsulated Ara h2 epitopes induced robust tolerogenic effects in C3H/HeJ mice, sensitized to and subsequently challenged with crude peanut allergen extract. In addition to alleviating physical manifestations of anaphylaxis, there was suppression of Th2-mediated cytokine production, IgE synthesis, and mast cell release, accompanied by increased IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 production in the peritoneum. Similar efficacy was demonstrated during LNP administration postsensitization. While nondecorated particles had lesser but significant effects, PolyA/LNP-Man lacked protective effects. These results demonstrate an exciting application of mRNA/LNP for treatment of food allergen anaphylaxis, with the promise to be widely applicable to the allergy field.",

Lung-, spleen- and liver-targeted SORT lipid nanoparticles were designed to selectively edit therapeutically relevant cell types including epithelial cells, endothelial cells, B cells, T cells and hepatocytes. SORT is compatible with multiple gene editing techniques, including mRNA, Cas9 mRNA/single guide RNA and Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complexes, and is envisioned to aid the development of protein replacement and gene correction therapeutics in targeted tissues.

The size and charge of a delivery system largely affects the transitivity to and distribution within LN. Although pH-sensitive lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) prepared by microfluidic mixing are the latest delivery system to be applied clinically, the effects of their size and charge on the transitivity to and distribution within LN are currently unknown. We investigated the size and charge effect of LNPs prepared by microfluidic mixing on transitivity to and distribution within LNs. A 30 nm sized LNP (30-LNP) was efficiently translocated to LNs and was taken up by CD8+ dendritic cells, while the efficiency was drastically decreased in the cases of 100 nm and 200 nm sized LNPs. Furthermore, a comparative study between neutral, positively and negatively charged 30-LNP revealed that the negative 30-LNP moved to the LN more efficiently than the other LNPs. Interestingly, the negative 30-LNP reached the deep cortex, namely the T cell zone. Our findings provide informative insights for designing LN-targeting LNPs prepared by microfluidic mixing and for the translocation of nanoparticles in LNs."

As systemic delivery platforms, these technologies are exemplified by Onpattro, an approved LNP\u2010based RNA interference therapy, administered intravenously and targeted to parenchymal liver cells. The discovery of systemically administered LNP technologies capable of preferential RNA delivery beyond hepatocytes has, however, proven more challenging. Here, preceded by comprehensive mechanistic understanding of in vivo nanoparticle biodistribution and bodily clearance, an LNP\u2010based messenger RNA (mRNA) delivery platform is rationally designed to preferentially target the hepatic reticuloendothelial system (RES). Evaluated in embryonic zebrafish, validated in mice, and directly compared to LNP\u2013mRNA systems based on the lipid composition of Onpattro, RES\u2010targeted LNPs significantly enhance mRNA expression both globally within the liver and specifically within hepatic RES cell types. Hepatic RES targeting requires just a single lipid change within the formulation of Onpattro to switch LNP surface charge from neutral to anionic. This technology not only provides new opportunities to treat liver\u2010specific and systemic diseases in which RES cell types play a key role but, more importantly, exemplifies that rational design of advanced RNA therapies must be preceded by a robust understanding of the dominant nano\u2013biointeractions involved.",

We developed a liver-targeting lipid nanoparticle (LNP) platform to deliver mRNA-encoded peanut allergen epitopes to liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), which function as robust tolerogenic antigen-presenting cells that induce FoxP3+ regulatory T-cells (Tregs). The mRNA strand was constructed by including nucleotide sequences encoding for nonallergenic MHC-II binding T-cell epitopes, identified in the dominant peanut allergen, Ara h2. These epitopes were inserted in the mRNA strand downstream of an MHC-II targeting sequence, further endowed in vitro with 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 capping sequences, a PolyA tail, and uridine substitution. Codon-optimized mRNA was used for microfluidics synthesis of LNPs with an ionizable cationic lipid, also decorated with a lipid-anchored mannose ligand for LSEC targeting. Biodistribution to the liver was confirmed by in vivo imaging, while ELISpot assays demonstrated an increase in IL-10-producing Tregs in the spleen. Prophylactic administration of tandem-repeat or a combination of encapsulated Ara h2 epitopes induced robust tolerogenic effects in C3H/HeJ mice, sensitized to and subsequently challenged with crude peanut allergen extract. In addition to alleviating physical manifestations of anaphylaxis, there was suppression of Th2-mediated cytokine production, IgE synthesis, and mast cell release, accompanied by increased IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 production in the peritoneum. Similar efficacy was demonstrated during LNP administration postsensitization. While nondecorated particles had lesser but significant effects, PolyA/LNP-Man lacked protective effects. These results demonstrate an exciting application of mRNA/LNP for treatment of food allergen anaphylaxis, with the promise to be widely applicable to the allergy field.",

METHODS In this phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned patients with hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis with polyneuropathy, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive intravenous patisiran (0.3 mg per kilogram of body weight) or placebo once every 3 weeks. The primary end point was the change from baseline in the modified Neuropathy Impairment Score+7 (mNIS+7; range, 0 to 304, with higher scores indicating more impairment) at 18 months. Other assessments included the Norfolk Quality of Life\u2013Diabetic Neuropathy (Norfolk QOL\u2010DN) questionnaire (range, \u20104 to 136, with higher scores indicating worse quality of life), 10\u2010m walk test (with gait speed measured in meters per second), and modified body\u2010mass index (modified BMI, defined as [weight in kilograms divided by square of height in meters]\u00d7albumin level in grams per liter; lower values indicated worse nutritional status). RESULTS A total of 225 patients underwent randomization (148 to the patisiran group and 77 to the placebo group). The mean (\u00b1SD) mNIS+7 at baseline was 80.9\u00b141.5 in the patisiran group and 74.6\u00b137.0 in the placebo group; the least\u2010squares mean (\u00b1SE) change from baseline was \u20106.0\u00b11.7 versus 28.0\u00b12.6 (difference, \u201034.0 points; P<0.001) at 18 months. The mean (\u00b1SD) baseline Norfolk QOL\u2010DN score was 59.6\u00b128.2 in the patisiran group and 55.5\u00b124.3 in the placebo group; the least\u2010squares mean (\u00b1SE) change from baseline was \u20106.7\u00b11.8 versus 14.4\u00b12.7 (difference, \u201021.1 points; P<0.001) at 18 months. Patisiran also showed an effect on gait speed and modified BMI. At 18 months, the least\u2010squares mean change from baseline in gait speed was 0.08\u00b10.02 m per second with patisiran versus \u20100.24\u00b10.04 m per second with placebo (difference, 0.31 m per second; P<0.001), and the least\u2010squares mean change from baseline in the modified BMI was \u20103.7\u00b19.6 versus \u2010119.4\u00b114.5 (difference, 115.7; P<0.001).

Fast identification of nanoparticle delivery (FIND) is a DNA barcode\u2010based system designed to measure how over 100 lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) deliver mRNA that functions in the cytoplasm of target cells in a single mouse. By using FIND to quantify how 75 chemically distinct LNPs delivered mRNA to 28 cell types in vivo, it is found that an LNP formulated with oxidized cholesterol and no targeting ligand delivers Cre mRNA, which edits DNA in hepatic endothelial cells and Kupffer cells at 0.05 mg kg\u22121. Notably, the LNP targets liver microenvironmental cells fivefold more potently than hepatocytes. The structure of the oxidized cholesterols added to the LNP is systematically varied to show that the position of the oxidative modification may be important; cholesterols modified on the hydrocarbon tail associated with sterol ring D tend to outperform cholesterols modified on sterol ring B.

Ionizable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been widely used for in vivo delivery of RNA therapeutics into the liver. However, a main challenge remains to develop LNP formulations for selective delivery of RNA into certain types of liver cells, such as hepatocytes and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). Here, we report the engineered LNPs for the targeted delivery of RNA into hepatocytes and LSECs. The effects of particle size and polyethylene glycol\u2013lipid content in the LNPs were evaluated for the hepatocyte-specific delivery of mRNA by ApoE-mediated cellular uptake through low-density lipoprotein receptors. Targeted delivery of RNA to LSECs was further investigated using active ligands. Incorporation of mannose allowed the selective delivery of RNA to LSECs, while minimizing the unwanted cellular uptake by hepatocytes. These results demonstrate that engineered LNPs have great potential for the cell type\u2013specific delivery of RNA into the liver and other tissues.",

As systemic delivery platforms, these technologies are exemplified by Onpattro, an approved LNP\u2010based RNA interference therapy, administered intravenously and targeted to parenchymal liver cells. The discovery of systemically administered LNP technologies capable of preferential RNA delivery beyond hepatocytes has, however, proven more challenging. Here, preceded by comprehensive mechanistic understanding of in vivo nanoparticle biodistribution and bodily clearance, an LNP\u2010based messenger RNA (mRNA) delivery platform is rationally designed to preferentially target the hepatic reticuloendothelial system (RES). Evaluated in embryonic zebrafish, validated in mice, and directly compared to LNP\u2013mRNA systems based on the lipid composition of Onpattro, RES\u2010targeted LNPs significantly enhance mRNA expression both globally within the liver and specifically within hepatic RES cell types. Hepatic RES targeting requires just a single lipid change within the formulation of Onpattro to switch LNP surface charge from neutral to anionic. This technology not only provides new opportunities to treat liver\u2010specific and systemic diseases in which RES cell types play a key role but, more importantly, exemplifies that rational design of advanced RNA therapies must be preceded by a robust understanding of the dominant nano\u2013biointeractions involved."

A synthesis format is appropriate to give readers the foundational knowledge needed to understand the specialized targeting strategies.\n\n2. \"Ligand-Mediated Targeting Strategies\": Many quotes discuss adding specific ligands to LNPs to target LSECs.

A synthesis format allows for explaining the relationships between these modifications.\n\n4. \"Physical Characteristics Optimization\": Information about how size, charge, and other physical properties affect LSEC targeting appears in multiple quotes.

Effective LSEC targeting demands understanding the unique biological features of these cells and designing LNPs that can selectively interact with them while avoiding uptake by hepatocytes. (LLM Memory)",
                "text": "\nLipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have emerged as promising delivery systems for nucleic acid therapeutics, but their tendency to accumulate primarily in hepatocytes presents a challenge when targeting liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). LSECs constitute approximately 15-20% of liver cells and perform critical functions including blood filtration, immune regulation, and mediating the exchange of molecules between blood and the space of Disse. Unlike hepatocytes, LSECs have distinctive characteristics such as fenestrations (small pores), lack of a basement membrane, and specific surface receptors that can be exploited for targeted delivery. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">\n\nThe conventional LNP formulations used for RNA delivery typically consist of four main components: ionizable lipids, helper lipids, cholesterol, and PEG-lipids. These standard formulations predominantly deliver their cargo to hepatocytes through interactions with apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and subsequent uptake via low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLRs). This natural tropism for hepatocytes creates a significant barrier to LSEC-specific targeting, necessitating specialized strategies to redirect LNPs to these endothelial cells. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">\n\nDeveloping LSEC-targeted LNPs requires a multifaceted approach that considers the unique anatomical location of LSECs at the interface between blood and liver parenchyma, their distinct endocytic receptor profile, and their fenestrated structure. Successful targeting strategies must not only enhance LNP interactions with LSECs but also reduce hepatocyte uptake to improve specificity. This introduction frames the subsequent discussion of specific targeting approaches including ligand-mediated targeting, lipid composition modifications, physical characteristic optimization, pKa adjustments, and passive targeting mechanisms. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">",

                "text": "\nLigand-mediated targeting represents one of the most promising approaches for directing LNPs specifically to LSECs by exploiting the unique receptor profile of these cells. The mannose receptor (CD206), which is highly and specifically expressed on LSECs, has emerged as a particularly effective target. Kim et al. demonstrated that incorporating mannose into highly PEGylated LNPs allowed for selective delivery of mRNA/siRNA to LSECs through mannose-CD206 interactions while substantially decreasing uptake by hepatocytes. <Paper corpusId=\"232059366\" paperTitle=\"(Kim et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> This mannose-targeting strategy was further validated by multiple independent studies, confirming its effectiveness for LSEC-specific delivery. <Paper corpusId=\"250244349\" paperTitle=\"(Albertsen et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"256029453\" paperTitle=\"(Dilliard et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"256547368\" paperTitle=\"(Liu et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nThe mechanism behind mannose-targeted LNP delivery involves a dual approach: the mannose ligand provides active targeting to LSECs through receptor-specific binding, while high PEG content (approximately 3%) reduces ApoE-mediated uptake by hepatocytes. <Paper corpusId=\"232059366\" paperTitle=\"(Kim et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> This combination effectively redirects LNPs away from their natural hepatocyte tropism toward preferential LSEC uptake. Xu et al. successfully employed this strategy using mannose-modified DSPE-PEG 2000 as the PEGylated lipid moiety of LNPs to achieve LSEC-specific delivery of GFP mRNA. <Paper corpusId=\"269341432\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"257231907\" paperTitle=\"(Xu et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nBeyond mannose targeting, other receptor-specific approaches have shown promise. Pattipeiluhu et al. developed anionic LNPs that preferentially target the hepatic reticuloendothelial system, including LSECs, through interactions with scavenger receptors stabilin-1 and stabilin-2. <Paper corpusId=\"269341432\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"247129065\" paperTitle=\"(Pattipeiluhu et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"276413641\" paperTitle=\"(Hosseini-Kharat et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper> Additionally, Gil et al. demonstrated that specific ligands targeting CD32b, CD36, and integrin \u03b1V\u03b23 receptors enhanced uptake by LSECs compared to scrambled control variants. <Paper corpusId=\"264137468\" paperTitle=\"(Gil et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nThe implementation of ligand-mediated targeting can be achieved either by incorporating targeting ligands during LNP production or through post-insertion techniques. <Paper corpusId=\"272554037\" paperTitle=\"(Lu et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> This flexibility in manufacturing allows for optimization of the targeting strategy based on specific applications. The selective organ targeting (SORT) approach, which systematically engineers LNPs with supplemental targeting molecules, represents another promising strategy that can be applied to direct LNPs to LSECs. <Paper corpusId=\"267271381\" paperTitle=\"(Kishore et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"214808084\" paperTitle=\"(Cheng et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nOverall, ligand-mediated targeting, particularly mannose receptor targeting, offers a powerful and well-validated approach for achieving LSEC-specific delivery while minimizing hepatocyte uptake, making it a central strategy in the development of LSEC-targeted therapeutics.",

It is likely that, when PEGlipid content is high enough, the ApoE-mediated cellular uptake is mostly reduced, while mannose-CD206 interaction becomes predominant for the cellular entry of LNPs. Moreover, mannoseincorporated LNPs showed bigger physical size than the diameter of the fenestrae.

Further cell specificity was achieved by increasing the PEG density on the LNP surface to reduce ApoE binding and subsequent hepatocyte targeting.\n\nManipulating the molecular composition of nanoparticles also leads to LSEC delivery.

                            "While oral desensitization is capable of alleviating peanut allergen anaphylaxis, long-term immune tolerance is the sought-after goal. We developed a liver-targeting lipid nanoparticle (LNP) platform to deliver mRNA-encoded peanut allergen epitopes to liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), which function as robust tolerogenic antigen-presenting cells that induce FoxP3+ regulatory T-cells (Tregs). The mRNA strand was constructed by including nucleotide sequences encoding for nonallergenic MHC-II binding T-cell epitopes, identified in the dominant peanut allergen, Ara h2. These epitopes were inserted in the mRNA strand downstream of an MHC-II targeting sequence, further endowed in vitro with 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 capping sequences, a PolyA tail, and uridine substitution. Codon-optimized mRNA was used for microfluidics synthesis of LNPs with an ionizable cationic lipid, also decorated with a lipid-anchored mannose ligand for LSEC targeting. Biodistribution to the liver was confirmed by in vivo imaging, while ELISpot assays demonstrated an increase in IL-10-producing Tregs in the spleen. Prophylactic administration of tandem-repeat or a combination of encapsulated Ara h2 epitopes induced robust tolerogenic effects in C3H/HeJ mice, sensitized to and subsequently challenged with crude peanut allergen extract. In addition to alleviating physical manifestations of anaphylaxis, there was suppression of Th2-mediated cytokine production, IgE synthesis, and mast cell release, accompanied by increased IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 production in the peritoneum. Similar efficacy was demonstrated during LNP administration postsensitization. While nondecorated particles had lesser but significant effects, PolyA/LNP-Man lacked protective effects. These results demonstrate an exciting application of mRNA/LNP for treatment of food allergen anaphylaxis, with the promise to be widely applicable to the allergy field."

                            "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are the leading nonviral technologies for the delivery of exogenous RNA to target cells in vivo. As systemic delivery platforms, these technologies are exemplified by Onpattro, an approved LNP\u2010based RNA interference therapy, administered intravenously and targeted to parenchymal liver cells. The discovery of systemically administered LNP technologies capable of preferential RNA delivery beyond hepatocytes has, however, proven more challenging. Here, preceded by comprehensive mechanistic understanding of in vivo nanoparticle biodistribution and bodily clearance, an LNP\u2010based messenger RNA (mRNA) delivery platform is rationally designed to preferentially target the hepatic reticuloendothelial system (RES). Evaluated in embryonic zebrafish, validated in mice, and directly compared to LNP\u2013mRNA systems based on the lipid composition of Onpattro, RES\u2010targeted LNPs significantly enhance mRNA expression both globally within the liver and specifically within hepatic RES cell types. Hepatic RES targeting requires just a single lipid change within the formulation of Onpattro to switch LNP surface charge from neutral to anionic. This technology not only provides new opportunities to treat liver\u2010specific and systemic diseases in which RES cell types play a key role but, more importantly, exemplifies that rational design of advanced RNA therapies must be preceded by a robust understanding of the dominant nano\u2013biointeractions involved."

However, it is currently impossible to rationally design nanoparticles that selectively target specific tissues. Here, we report a strategy termed selective organ targeting (SORT) wherein multiple classes of lipid nanoparticles are systematically engineered to exclusively edit extrahepatic tissues via addition of a supplemental SORT molecule. Lung-, spleen- and liver-targeted SORT lipid nanoparticles were designed to selectively edit therapeutically relevant cell types including epithelial cells, endothelial cells, B cells, T cells and hepatocytes. SORT is compatible with multiple gene editing techniques, including mRNA, Cas9 mRNA/single guide RNA and Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complexes, and is envisioned to aid the development of protein replacement and gene correction therapeutics in targeted tissues. The addition of selective organ targeting molecules to nanoparticles allows the specific targeting of extrahepatic tissues, enabling gene editing of distinct cell populations outside the liver."

                "text": "\nModifying the lipid composition of LNPs represents a powerful strategy for redirecting nanoparticles away from hepatocytes and toward LSECs. One of the most effective approaches involves replacing standard cholesterol with oxidized cholesterol variants. Paunovska et al. demonstrated that LNPs formulated with oxidized cholesterol could deliver mRNA to liver microenvironmental cells, including LSECs, at a fivefold higher potency than to hepatocytes, even at clinically relevant doses of 0.05 mg/kg. <Paper corpusId=\"73435998\" paperTitle=\"(Paunovska et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper> This oxidized cholesterol approach was confirmed by multiple independent studies, establishing its reliability for shifting LNP targeting from hepatocytes to LSECs. <Paper corpusId=\"250972048\" paperTitle=\"(Kularatne et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"272838041\" paperTitle=\"(Liu et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"256547368\" paperTitle=\"(Liu et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nThe specific structure of the oxidized cholesterol appears to be crucial for LSEC targeting efficacy. Research has shown that cholesterols modified on the hydrocarbon tail associated with sterol ring D tend to outperform those modified on sterol ring B. <Paper corpusId=\"73435998\" paperTitle=\"(Paunovska et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper> This structure-function relationship highlights the importance of precise chemical modifications in directing LNP tropism.\n\nAnother promising compositional modification involves replacing neutral phospholipids with anionic alternatives. Pattipeiluhu et al. developed scavenger receptor LNPs (srLNPs) by substituting the zwitterionic lipid DSPC used in the approved Onpattro formulation with the anionic lipid DSPG. <Paper corpusId=\"247129065\" paperTitle=\"(Pattipeiluhu et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"257862241\" paperTitle=\"(Xu et al._1, 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> This simple change dramatically altered the biodistribution profile of the LNPs, redirecting them from hepatocytes to LSECs and Kupffer cells. The mechanism appears to involve both enhanced binding to scavenger receptors (stabilin-1/2) on LSECs and reduced interaction with apolipoprotein E, which typically mediates hepatocyte uptake through LDL receptors. <Paper corpusId=\"259055696\" paperTitle=\"(Wang et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nComparative studies have confirmed the differential targeting patterns of these modified LNPs. Phosphatidylglycerol-containing LNPs accumulate predominantly in LSECs and Kupffer cells, while phosphatidylcholine-containing LNPs distribute more evenly across hepatocytes, LSECs, and Kupffer cells. <Paper corpusId=\"273570097\" paperTitle=\"(Vasileva et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> This clear distinction in cellular tropism makes lipid composition modifications a valuable approach for LSEC-specific targeting.\n\nThese compositional strategies can be combined with other approaches, such as ligand-mediated targeting, to further enhance LSEC specificity. For instance, mannose-decorated LNPs with modified lipid compositions have shown superior LSEC targeting compared to either strategy alone. <Paper corpusId=\"257231907\" paperTitle=\"(Xu et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"256547368\" paperTitle=\"(Liu et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> This synergistic approach leverages both the altered biodistribution properties of modified lipids and the receptor-specific binding of targeting ligands.",

However, systemically delivering mRNA to cell types besides hepatocytes remains challenging. Fast identification of nanoparticle delivery (FIND) is a DNA barcode\u2010based system designed to measure how over 100 lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) deliver mRNA that functions in the cytoplasm of target cells in a single mouse. By using FIND to quantify how 75 chemically distinct LNPs delivered mRNA to 28 cell types in vivo, it is found that an LNP formulated with oxidized cholesterol and no targeting ligand delivers Cre mRNA, which edits DNA in hepatic endothelial cells and Kupffer cells at 0.05 mg kg\u22121. Notably, the LNP targets liver microenvironmental cells fivefold more potently than hepatocytes. The structure of the oxidized cholesterols added to the LNP is systematically varied to show that the position of the oxidative modification may be important; cholesterols modified on the hydrocarbon tail associated with sterol ring D tend to outperform cholesterols modified on sterol ring B. These data suggest that LNPs formulated with modified cholesterols can deliver gene\u2010editing mRNA to the liver microenvironment at clinically relevant doses."

(Paunovska et al., 2019) explored the use of different types of cholesterol to modify LNPs and reported that the structure of the cholesterol significantly affects the targeting ability of the LNPs. In addition, by using the Fast Identification Nanoparticle Delivery (FIND) system, they screened LNPs formulated with different oxidized cholesterol and observed that LNPs containing oxidized cholesterol can efficiently deliver mRNA to cells in the liver microenvironment, including Kupffer cells and liver endothelial cells. This contrasts with conventional LNPs, which primarily target hepatocytes, and suggests that the targeting of LNPs to specific cell types can be improved by specific chemical modifications."

                            "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are the leading nonviral technologies for the delivery of exogenous RNA to target cells in vivo. As systemic delivery platforms, these technologies are exemplified by Onpattro, an approved LNP\u2010based RNA interference therapy, administered intravenously and targeted to parenchymal liver cells. The discovery of systemically administered LNP technologies capable of preferential RNA delivery beyond hepatocytes has, however, proven more challenging. Here, preceded by comprehensive mechanistic understanding of in vivo nanoparticle biodistribution and bodily clearance, an LNP\u2010based messenger RNA (mRNA) delivery platform is rationally designed to preferentially target the hepatic reticuloendothelial system (RES). Evaluated in embryonic zebrafish, validated in mice, and directly compared to LNP\u2013mRNA systems based on the lipid composition of Onpattro, RES\u2010targeted LNPs significantly enhance mRNA expression both globally within the liver and specifically within hepatic RES cell types. Hepatic RES targeting requires just a single lipid change within the formulation of Onpattro to switch LNP surface charge from neutral to anionic. This technology not only provides new opportunities to treat liver\u2010specific and systemic diseases in which RES cell types play a key role but, more importantly, exemplifies that rational design of advanced RNA therapies must be preceded by a robust understanding of the dominant nano\u2013biointeractions involved."

                            "While oral desensitization is capable of alleviating peanut allergen anaphylaxis, long-term immune tolerance is the sought-after goal. We developed a liver-targeting lipid nanoparticle (LNP) platform to deliver mRNA-encoded peanut allergen epitopes to liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), which function as robust tolerogenic antigen-presenting cells that induce FoxP3+ regulatory T-cells (Tregs). The mRNA strand was constructed by including nucleotide sequences encoding for nonallergenic MHC-II binding T-cell epitopes, identified in the dominant peanut allergen, Ara h2. These epitopes were inserted in the mRNA strand downstream of an MHC-II targeting sequence, further endowed in vitro with 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 capping sequences, a PolyA tail, and uridine substitution. Codon-optimized mRNA was used for microfluidics synthesis of LNPs with an ionizable cationic lipid, also decorated with a lipid-anchored mannose ligand for LSEC targeting. Biodistribution to the liver was confirmed by in vivo imaging, while ELISpot assays demonstrated an increase in IL-10-producing Tregs in the spleen. Prophylactic administration of tandem-repeat or a combination of encapsulated Ara h2 epitopes induced robust tolerogenic effects in C3H/HeJ mice, sensitized to and subsequently challenged with crude peanut allergen extract. In addition to alleviating physical manifestations of anaphylaxis, there was suppression of Th2-mediated cytokine production, IgE synthesis, and mast cell release, accompanied by increased IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 production in the peritoneum. Similar efficacy was demonstrated during LNP administration postsensitization. While nondecorated particles had lesser but significant effects, PolyA/LNP-Man lacked protective effects. These results demonstrate an exciting application of mRNA/LNP for treatment of food allergen anaphylaxis, with the promise to be widely applicable to the allergy field."

                "text": "\nThe physical characteristics of lipid nanoparticles play a crucial role in determining their cellular tropism within the liver. Particle size, in particular, has emerged as a key parameter for directing LNPs to LSECs rather than hepatocytes. Kim et al. demonstrated that LNPs with larger diameters preferentially transfect LSECs over hepatocytes, as these particles cannot pass through the fenestrations of liver sinusoids to reach hepatocytes. <Paper corpusId=\"232059366\" paperTitle=\"(Kim et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> This size-dependent targeting mechanism was confirmed by multiple studies, including the work of Sato et al., who found that increasing particle size improved LSEC-specific gene silencing. <Paper corpusId=\"205208610\" paperTitle=\"(Sato et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nThe selective targeting of LSECs via size optimization leverages the unique liver microarchitecture. Hepatic sinusoids contain discontinuous vasculature with fenestrations that allow smaller particles to reach hepatocytes, while larger particles remain in contact with LSECs. <Paper corpusId=\"235642114\" paperTitle=\"(Saw et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"24451717\" paperTitle=\"(Tsoi et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper> This principle aligns with observations by Liu et al., who noted that nanoparticles with larger diameters were not filtered through liver fenestrations, thereby enhancing LSEC targeting. <Paper corpusId=\"256547368\" paperTitle=\"(Liu et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nSurface charge represents another critical physical characteristic for LSEC targeting. Negatively charged (anionic) LNPs have demonstrated superior targeting to the hepatic reticuloendothelial system, including LSECs. <Paper corpusId=\"267332311\" paperTitle=\"(Chia et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> This effect is attributed to interactions between anionic LNPs and scavenger receptors like stabilin-1 and stabilin-2 that are highly expressed on LSECs. <Paper corpusId=\"276413641\" paperTitle=\"(Hosseini-Kharat et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"247129065\" paperTitle=\"(Pattipeiluhu et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nThe degree of PEGylation also significantly influences LNP distribution within the liver. High PEG content (approximately 3%) reduces ApoE-mediated hepatocyte uptake, allowing other targeting mechanisms to predominate. When combined with specific targeting ligands like mannose, highly PEGylated LNPs show enhanced LSEC selectivity by simultaneously reducing hepatocyte uptake and promoting receptor-specific interactions with LSECs. <Paper corpusId=\"232059366\" paperTitle=\"(Kim et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nThe systematic engineering of these physical properties can be incorporated into broader strategies like the selective organ targeting (SORT) approach, which uses supplemental targeting molecules to direct LNPs to specific tissues and cell types. <Paper corpusId=\"267271381\" paperTitle=\"(Kishore et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"214808084\" paperTitle=\"(Cheng et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> This rational design approach allows for passive targeting\u2014achieving cell-specific delivery without relying solely on ligand-receptor interactions but instead leveraging inherent nanoparticle characteristics. <Paper corpusId=\"267332311\" paperTitle=\"(Chia et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"210951181\" paperTitle=\"(Nakamura et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nWhen these physical optimization strategies are combined with other approaches, such as ligand-mediated targeting or lipid composition modifications, the specificity for LSECs can be further enhanced. For example, mannose-decorated LNPs with optimized size have shown synergistic effects in LSEC targeting by combining both physical exclusion from hepatocytes and receptor-specific binding to LSECs. <Paper corpusId=\"232059366\" paperTitle=\"(Kim et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>",

                            "The liver and spleen are major biological barriers to translating nanomedicines because they sequester the majority of administered nanomaterials and prevent delivery to diseased tissue. Here we examined the blood clearance mechanism of administered hard nanomaterials in relation to blood flow dynamics, organ microarchitecture, and cellular phenotype. We found that nanomaterial velocity reduces 1000-fold as they enter and traverse the liver, leading to 7.5 times more nanomaterial interaction with hepatic cells relative to peripheral cells. In the liver, Kupffer cells (84.8%\u00b16.4%), hepatic B cells (81.5\u00b19.3%), and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (64.6\u00b113.7%) interacted with administered PEGylated quantum dots but splenic macrophages took up less (25.4\u00b110.1%) due to differences in phenotype. The uptake patterns were similar for two other nanomaterial types and five different surface chemistries. Potential new strategies to overcome off-target nanomaterial accumulation may involve manipulating intra-organ flow dynamics and modulating cellular phenotype to alter hepatic cell interaction."

                            "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are the leading nonviral technologies for the delivery of exogenous RNA to target cells in vivo. As systemic delivery platforms, these technologies are exemplified by Onpattro, an approved LNP\u2010based RNA interference therapy, administered intravenously and targeted to parenchymal liver cells. The discovery of systemically administered LNP technologies capable of preferential RNA delivery beyond hepatocytes has, however, proven more challenging. Here, preceded by comprehensive mechanistic understanding of in vivo nanoparticle biodistribution and bodily clearance, an LNP\u2010based messenger RNA (mRNA) delivery platform is rationally designed to preferentially target the hepatic reticuloendothelial system (RES). Evaluated in embryonic zebrafish, validated in mice, and directly compared to LNP\u2013mRNA systems based on the lipid composition of Onpattro, RES\u2010targeted LNPs significantly enhance mRNA expression both globally within the liver and specifically within hepatic RES cell types. Hepatic RES targeting requires just a single lipid change within the formulation of Onpattro to switch LNP surface charge from neutral to anionic. This technology not only provides new opportunities to treat liver\u2010specific and systemic diseases in which RES cell types play a key role but, more importantly, exemplifies that rational design of advanced RNA therapies must be preceded by a robust understanding of the dominant nano\u2013biointeractions involved."

However, it is currently impossible to rationally design nanoparticles that selectively target specific tissues. Here, we report a strategy termed selective organ targeting (SORT) wherein multiple classes of lipid nanoparticles are systematically engineered to exclusively edit extrahepatic tissues via addition of a supplemental SORT molecule. Lung-, spleen- and liver-targeted SORT lipid nanoparticles were designed to selectively edit therapeutically relevant cell types including epithelial cells, endothelial cells, B cells, T cells and hepatocytes. SORT is compatible with multiple gene editing techniques, including mRNA, Cas9 mRNA/single guide RNA and Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complexes, and is envisioned to aid the development of protein replacement and gene correction therapeutics in targeted tissues. The addition of selective organ targeting molecules to nanoparticles allows the specific targeting of extrahepatic tissues, enabling gene editing of distinct cell populations outside the liver."

The size and charge of a delivery system largely affects the transitivity to and distribution within LN. Although pH-sensitive lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) prepared by microfluidic mixing are the latest delivery system to be applied clinically, the effects of their size and charge on the transitivity to and distribution within LN are currently unknown. We investigated the size and charge effect of LNPs prepared by microfluidic mixing on transitivity to and distribution within LNs. A 30 nm sized LNP (30-LNP) was efficiently translocated to LNs and was taken up by CD8+ dendritic cells, while the efficiency was drastically decreased in the cases of 100 nm and 200 nm sized LNPs. Furthermore, a comparative study between neutral, positively and negatively charged 30-LNP revealed that the negative 30-LNP moved to the LN more efficiently than the other LNPs. Interestingly, the negative 30-LNP reached the deep cortex, namely the T cell zone. Our findings provide informative insights for designing LN-targeting LNPs prepared by microfluidic mixing and for the translocation of nanoparticles in LNs."

                "text": "\nThe acid dissociation constant (pKa) of ionizable lipids within LNPs has emerged as a critical parameter that can be precisely tuned to redirect nanoparticles from hepatocytes to LSECs. Research by Sato et al. demonstrated that increasing the pKa value of ionizable lipids resulted in significant changes to the intrahepatic localization of siRNA, effectively shifting gene-silencing efficiency from hepatocytes toward LSECs. <Paper corpusId=\"205208610\" paperTitle=\"(Sato et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper> This relationship between pKa and cellular tropism has been further validated by subsequent studies, establishing pKa adjustment as a reliable strategy for cell-specific targeting within the liver.\n\nThe optimal pKa value for LSEC targeting appears to be distinctly different from that required for hepatocyte delivery. While hepatocyte-targeted LNPs typically feature ionizable lipids with pKa values around 6.4-6.5, LSEC-targeted formulations require higher pKa values of approximately 7.1-7.2. <Paper corpusId=\"256029453\" paperTitle=\"(Dilliard et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> This shift in pKa corresponds directly to changes in the ionization status of the LNPs, which influences their cellular interactions and uptake mechanisms. Shobaki et al. successfully demonstrated LSEC-specific delivery using LNPs with a pKa value of 7.15, which provided an optimal ionization status (approximately 36% cationic charge) for LSEC uptake. <Paper corpusId=\"56895022\" paperTitle=\"(Shobaki et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nThe mechanism behind this pKa-dependent targeting appears to relate to the physiological location of LSECs as border cells positioned between hepatocytes and the bloodstream. LNPs containing lipids with lower pKa values (such as YSK05 and YSK13-C3 with pKa values of 6.50 and 6.45, respectively) preferentially distribute to hepatocytes, while those with higher pKa values (like YSK13-C4 and YSK15-C4 with pKa values of 6.80 and 7.10, respectively) are predominantly taken up by LSECs. <Paper corpusId=\"56895022\" paperTitle=\"(Shobaki et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper> This difference in distribution patterns based on pKa illustrates how precise adjustments to the chemical properties of ionizable lipids can dramatically alter the cellular fate of LNPs within the liver.\n\nThe effectiveness of pKa adjustment strategies can be further enhanced when combined with other approaches discussed in previous sections. For instance, pairing optimized pKa values with appropriate particle size modifications can create synergistic effects that improve LSEC targeting specificity. <Paper corpusId=\"205208610\" paperTitle=\"(Sato et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper> This integrated approach to LNP design demonstrates how multiple parameters can be simultaneously optimized to achieve highly selective LSEC delivery while minimizing off-target hepatocyte uptake.",

Researchers have shown that specific piperazine-derived lipids, when incorporated at precise molar ratios within LNP formulations, can preferentially deliver cargo to liver immune cells (including LSECs) even at low dosages of 0.3 mg/kg. <Paper corpusId=\"267332311\" paperTitle=\"(Chia et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> This approach demonstrates how rational design of LNP components can achieve cell-type specificity without relying on active targeting mechanisms.\n\nThe passive targeting approach offers several advantages, including simplified manufacturing processes and potentially reduced immunogenicity compared to ligand-modified formulations. However, its success relies heavily on precise control of nanoparticle characteristics and understanding of liver microarchitecture. When combined with the strategies discussed in previous sections, such as optimized pKa values and particle sizes, passive targeting mechanisms can contribute to comprehensive approaches for achieving highly selective LSEC delivery.",

Here we examined the blood clearance mechanism of administered hard nanomaterials in relation to blood flow dynamics, organ microarchitecture, and cellular phenotype. We found that nanomaterial velocity reduces 1000-fold as they enter and traverse the liver, leading to 7.5 times more nanomaterial interaction with hepatic cells relative to peripheral cells. In the liver, Kupffer cells (84.8%\u00b16.4%), hepatic B cells (81.5\u00b19.3%), and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (64.6\u00b113.7%) interacted with administered PEGylated quantum dots but splenic macrophages took up less (25.4\u00b110.1%) due to differences in phenotype. The uptake patterns were similar for two other nanomaterial types and five different surface chemistries. Potential new strategies to overcome off-target nanomaterial accumulation may involve manipulating intra-organ flow dynamics and modulating cellular phenotype to alter hepatic cell interaction."

The size and charge of a delivery system largely affects the transitivity to and distribution within LN. Although pH-sensitive lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) prepared by microfluidic mixing are the latest delivery system to be applied clinically, the effects of their size and charge on the transitivity to and distribution within LN are currently unknown. We investigated the size and charge effect of LNPs prepared by microfluidic mixing on transitivity to and distribution within LNs. A 30 nm sized LNP (30-LNP) was efficiently translocated to LNs and was taken up by CD8+ dendritic cells, while the efficiency was drastically decreased in the cases of 100 nm and 200 nm sized LNPs. Furthermore, a comparative study between neutral, positively and negatively charged 30-LNP revealed that the negative 30-LNP moved to the LN more efficiently than the other LNPs. Interestingly, the negative 30-LNP reached the deep cortex, namely the T cell zone. Our findings provide informative insights for designing LN-targeting LNPs prepared by microfluidic mixing and for the translocation of nanoparticles in LNs."

These approaches can be combined with size optimization and pKa adjustment for synergistic enhancement of LSEC targeting efficacy. (11 sources)",
                "text": "\n1. **Mannose receptor targeting**: The most extensively validated approach for LSEC-specific delivery, providing high selectivity by exploiting CD206 receptors uniquely expressed on LSECs. When combined with high PEG content (3%), this strategy substantially decreases hepatocyte uptake while enhancing LSEC delivery through mannose-CD206 interactions. <Paper corpusId=\"232059366\" paperTitle=\"(Kim et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"256029453\" paperTitle=\"(Dilliard et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"256547368\" paperTitle=\"(Liu et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"269341432\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"276413641\" paperTitle=\"(Hosseini-Kharat et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\n2. **Anionic lipid substitution**: Replacing neutral DSPC with anionic DSPG in LNP formulations provides a simple yet effective approach requiring only a single lipid change. This modification switches LNP surface charge from neutral to anionic, redirecting delivery from hepatocytes to LSECs through interactions with scavenger receptors (stabilin-1/2). <Paper corpusId=\"247129065\" paperTitle=\"(Pattipeiluhu et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"269341432\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"276413641\" paperTitle=\"(Hosseini-Kharat et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\n3. **Oxidized cholesterol incorporation**: Using oxidized cholesterol in place of standard cholesterol in LNP formulations can achieve a fivefold improvement in mRNA delivery to LSECs compared to hepatocytes, even at clinically relevant low doses (0.05 mg/kg). The position of oxidative modification appears important, with modifications on the hydrocarbon tail (sterol ring D) outperforming those on sterol ring B. <Paper corpusId=\"73435998\" paperTitle=\"(Paunovska et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"256547368\" paperTitle=\"(Liu et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\n4. **pKa optimization**: Adjusting the pKa value of ionizable lipids from the hepatocyte-optimal range (6.4-6.5) to approximately 7.1-7.2 significantly shifts LNP distribution from hepatocytes to LSECs. An optimal pKa value of 7.15 creates an appropriate ionization status (~36% cationic charge) for LSEC uptake. <Paper corpusId=\"205208610\" paperTitle=\"(Sato et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"256029453\" paperTitle=\"(Dilliard et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"56895022\" paperTitle=\"(Shobaki et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\n5. **Particle size optimization**: Increasing LNP size beyond the diameter of liver sinusoidal fenestrations enhances LSEC-specific delivery by preventing passage to hepatocytes. Larger particles preferentially transfect LSECs as they cannot filter through fenestrations to reach hepatocytes. <Paper corpusId=\"205208610\" paperTitle=\"(Sato et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"232059366\" paperTitle=\"(Kim et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"256547368\" paperTitle=\"(Liu et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\n6. **GalNAc modification**: A contrasting approach involves modifying LNPs with GalNAc ligands to maximize hepatocyte specificity while reducing LSEC uptake. This strategy helps prevent LNP-induced inflammation and toxicity in LSECs while maintaining therapeutic efficacy, as demonstrated with siRNA against hepatitis B virus. <Paper corpusId=\"268147071\" paperTitle=\"(Lin et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\n7. **Combination approaches**: The most effective LSEC targeting can be achieved by combining multiple strategies. For example, mannose-decorated LNPs with optimized size and high PEG content show synergistic effects by simultaneously reducing ApoE-mediated hepatocyte uptake, enhancing receptor-specific binding, and preventing passage through fenestrations. <Paper corpusId=\"232059366\" paperTitle=\"(Kim et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"272554037\" paperTitle=\"(Lu et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\n8. **Implementation considerations**: Ligand-mediated targeting can be achieved either by incorporating targeting ligands during LNP production or through post-insertion techniques, providing flexibility in manufacturing approaches. <Paper corpusId=\"272554037\" paperTitle=\"(Lu et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>",

Moreover, mannoseincorporated LNPs showed bigger physical size than the diameter of the fenestrae.

                            "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are the leading nonviral technologies for the delivery of exogenous RNA to target cells in vivo. As systemic delivery platforms, these technologies are exemplified by Onpattro, an approved LNP\u2010based RNA interference therapy, administered intravenously and targeted to parenchymal liver cells. The discovery of systemically administered LNP technologies capable of preferential RNA delivery beyond hepatocytes has, however, proven more challenging. Here, preceded by comprehensive mechanistic understanding of in vivo nanoparticle biodistribution and bodily clearance, an LNP\u2010based messenger RNA (mRNA) delivery platform is rationally designed to preferentially target the hepatic reticuloendothelial system (RES). Evaluated in embryonic zebrafish, validated in mice, and directly compared to LNP\u2013mRNA systems based on the lipid composition of Onpattro, RES\u2010targeted LNPs significantly enhance mRNA expression both globally within the liver and specifically within hepatic RES cell types. Hepatic RES targeting requires just a single lipid change within the formulation of Onpattro to switch LNP surface charge from neutral to anionic. This technology not only provides new opportunities to treat liver\u2010specific and systemic diseases in which RES cell types play a key role but, more importantly, exemplifies that rational design of advanced RNA therapies must be preceded by a robust understanding of the dominant nano\u2013biointeractions involved."

                            "Using mRNA to produce therapeutic proteins is a promising approach to treat genetic diseases. However, systemically delivering mRNA to cell types besides hepatocytes remains challenging. Fast identification of nanoparticle delivery (FIND) is a DNA barcode\u2010based system designed to measure how over 100 lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) deliver mRNA that functions in the cytoplasm of target cells in a single mouse. By using FIND to quantify how 75 chemically distinct LNPs delivered mRNA to 28 cell types in vivo, it is found that an LNP formulated with oxidized cholesterol and no targeting ligand delivers Cre mRNA, which edits DNA in hepatic endothelial cells and Kupffer cells at 0.05 mg kg\u22121. Notably, the LNP targets liver microenvironmental cells fivefold more potently than hepatocytes. The structure of the oxidized cholesterols added to the LNP is systematically varied to show that the position of the oxidative modification may be important; cholesterols modified on the hydrocarbon tail associated with sterol ring D tend to outperform cholesterols modified on sterol ring B. These data suggest that LNPs formulated with modified cholesterols can deliver gene\u2010editing mRNA to the liver microenvironment at clinically relevant doses."

For example, LNPs that contain lipids with low pKa values (eg, YSK05 and YSK13-C3 with pKa values of 6.50 and 6.45 pKa, respectively) are distributed in hepatocytes. Whereas, those containing lipids with higher pKa values (eg, YSK13-C4 and YSK15-C4 with pKa values of 6.80 and 7.10, respectively) are distributed in LSECs, 32 which are border cells that are located between hepatocytes and the blood stream. 16,17"
