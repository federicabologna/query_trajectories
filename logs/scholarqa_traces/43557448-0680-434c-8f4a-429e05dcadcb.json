This review summarizes recent advances in SPAs for cancer imaging and combination phototherapy. The applications of SPAs in optical imaging including fluorescence, photoacoustic, multimodal and activatable imaging are first described, followed by the discussion of applications in imaging-guided phototherapy and combination therapy, light-triggered drug delivery and gene regulation.

[3][4][5][6][7] Besides optical imaging, light can also trigger phototherapy including photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT), which are both promising therapeutic methods with the advantages of precise treatment and minimized side effects. [8][9][10][11] Thus, phototheranostics which combines optical imaging and phototherapy is a promising theranostic modality. [12][13][14] Until now, many materials have been developed as phototheranostic agents including near-infrared (NIR) dyes, [15][16][17][18][19] inorganic nanoparticles, 20,21 carbon and two-dimensional materials. [22][23][24] However, all of them have their own disadvantages such as poor photostability and low absorption coefficients. [25][26][27] Therefore, developing new optical agents with improved properties for phototheranostics is highly demanded.\n\nSemiconducting polymers (SPs) are macromolecules with pconjugated backbones, which have been widely applied in the \ue103elds of electronic devices and sensors because of their unique optical properties. 28 Recently, semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) derived from SPs have been applied in optical imaging owing to their high absorption coefficient, good photostability and biocompatibility. [29][30][31] In detail, SPNs can be applied in \ue104uorescence imaging including tumor imaging and cell tracking. [32][33][34][35] NIR-absorbing SPNs can be applied in photoacoustic (PA) imaging of stem cells, 36 vasculature, [37][38][39] tumor, [40][41]",

Zhou, Ziling Zeng, Quli Fan, Kanyi Pu\n## Abstract\nSemiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) have gained growing attention in biomedical applications. However, the preparation of SPNs is usually limited to nanoprecipitation in the presence of amphiphilic copolymers, which encounters the issue of dissociation. As an alternative to SPNs, grafted semiconducting polymer amphiphiles (SPAs) composed of a semiconducting polymer (SP) backbone and hydrophilic side chains show increased physiological stability and improved optical properties. This review summarizes recent advances in SPAs for cancer imaging and combination phototherapy. The applications of SPAs in optical imaging including fluorescence, photoacoustic, multimodal and activatable imaging are first described, followed by the discussion of applications in imaging-guided phototherapy and combination therapy, light-triggered drug delivery and gene regulation. At last, the conclusion and future prospects in this field are discussed.\n## Introduction\nCancer theranostics which integrates cancer imaging and therapy into one system provides the opportunity of continuous monitoring of therapeutic efficiency, thus allowing clinicians to design personalized medicine for each patient. 1,2 Among numerous imaging modalities, optical imaging which utilizes light as an excitation or signal source has gained more and more attention because of its advantages such as low toxicity, high sensitivity, low cost and minimal detection time. [3][4][5][6][7] Besides optical imaging, light can also trigger phototherapy including photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT), which are both promising therapeutic methods with the advantages of precise treatment and minimized side effects. [8][9][10][11] Thus, phototheranostics which combines optical imaging and phototherapy is a promising theranostic modality. [12][13][14] Until now, many materials have been developed as phototheranostic agents including near-infrared (NIR) dyes, [15][16][17][18][19] inorganic nanoparticles, 20,21 carbon and two-dimensional materials. [22][23][24] However, all of them have their own disadvantages such as poor photostability and low absorption coefficients. [25][26][27] Therefore, developing new optical agents with improved properties for phototheranostics is highly demanded.\n\nSemiconducting polymers (SPs) are macromolecules with pconjugated backbones, which have been widely applied in the \ue103elds of electronic devices and sensors because of their unique optical properties. 28 Recently, semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) derived from SPs have been applied in optical imaging owing to their high absorption coefficient, good photostability and biocompatibility. [29][30][31] In detail, SPNs can be applied in \ue104uorescence imaging including tumor imaging and cell tracking. [32][33][34][35] NIR-absorbing SPNs can be applied in photoacoustic (PA) imaging of stem cells, 36 vasculature, [37][38][39] tumor, [40][41]",

However, clinical translation of PAI based methods are still under scrutiny as the imaging quality and clinical information derived from PA images are not on par with other imaging methods. Hence, to improve PAI, exogenous contrast agents, in the form of nanomaterials, are being used to achieve better image with less side effects, lower accumulation, and improved target specificity. Nanomedicine has become inevitable in cancer management, as it contributes at every stage from diagnosis to therapy, surgery, and even in the postoperative care and surveillance for recurrence. Nanocontrast agents for PAI have been developed and are being explored for early and improved cancer diagnosis. The systemic stability and target specificity of the nanomaterials to render its theranostic property depends on various influencing factors such as the administration route and physico-chemical responsiveness. The recent focus in PAI is on targeting the lymphatic system and nodes for cancer diagnosis, as they play a vital role in cancer progression and metastasis. This review aims to discuss the clinical advancements of PAI using nanoparticles as exogenous contrast agents for cancer theranostics with emphasis on PAI of lymphatic system for diagnosis, cancer progression, metastasis, PAI guided tumor resection, and finally PAI guided drug delivery.

This review explores the application of photoacoustic imaging in brain tumor imaging, highlighting the synergy between nanomaterials and state of the art optical techniques to achieve high-resolution imaging of deeper brain tissues. PABI leverages the photoacoustic effect, where absorbed light energy causes thermoelastic expansion, generating ultrasound waves that are detected and converted into images. This technique enables precise diagnosis, therapy monitoring, and enhanced clinical screening, specifically in the management of complex diseases such as breast cancer, lymphatic disorder, and neurological conditions. Despite integration of photoacoustic agents and ultrasound radiation, providing a comprehensive overview of current methodologies, major obstacles in brain tumor treatment, and future directions for improving diagnostic and therapeutic outcomes. The review underscores the significance of PABI as a robust research tool and medical method, with the potential to revolutionize brain disease diagnosis and treatment. Graphical Abstract",

Fan et al. established perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic diimide (PDI) nanoparticles, featuring a tertiary amine electron donor and a diimide electron acceptor, for deep brain tumor imaging (Fig. 10a) [194]. Modified with DSPE-mPEG 5000 for water stability, these PDI nanoparticles showed enhanced PA signals in animal models with orthotopic glioblastoma upon continuous 700 nm laser irradiation, highlighting their efficacy through EPR effect and low toxicity (Fig. 10b). The synthetic routes for semiconducting polymeric nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 10c along with their reaction conditions [195]. \n\nJiang et al. developed semiconducting polymer nanoparticles with a donor-acceptor1-donor-acceptor2 structure, specifically poly(diketopyrrolopyrrole-altthiadiazoloquinoxaline), stabilized in water with a PEGb-PPG-b-PEG copolymer. These NPs absorbed in both NIR-I and NIR-II regions, improving brain vasculature visualization in rats using a NIR-II excitation laser 156. The 1064 nm laser yielded PA signals 1.4 times more intense than a 750 nm laser. Additionally, the authors created metabolizable NIR-II PA contrast agents using benzobisthiadiazole encapsulated with biodegradable PLGA-PEG, degraded by myeloperoxidase in phagocytes (Fig. 10d).

Sridharan, Jin Hyeong Park, Daehun Kim, Jean-Claude Vial, K. Kyhm, Hae Gyun Lim\n## Abstract\nPhotoacoustic brain imaging (PABI) has emerged as a promising biomedical imaging modality, combining high contrast of optical imaging with deep tissue penetration of ultrasound imaging. This review explores the application of photoacoustic imaging in brain tumor imaging, highlighting the synergy between nanomaterials and state of the art optical techniques to achieve high-resolution imaging of deeper brain tissues. PABI leverages the photoacoustic effect, where absorbed light energy causes thermoelastic expansion, generating ultrasound waves that are detected and converted into images. This technique enables precise diagnosis, therapy monitoring, and enhanced clinical screening, specifically in the management of complex diseases such as breast cancer, lymphatic disorder, and neurological conditions. Despite integration of photoacoustic agents and ultrasound radiation, providing a comprehensive overview of current methodologies, major obstacles in brain tumor treatment, and future directions for improving diagnostic and therapeutic outcomes. The review underscores the significance of PABI as a robust research tool and medical method, with the potential to revolutionize brain disease diagnosis and treatment. Graphical Abstract\n## Semiconductor nanoparticles for PA brain imaging\nSemiconducting polymer nanoparticles have emerged as promising contrast agents for PA imaging due to their efficient photothermal conversion [193]. These nanoparticles, utilizing electron donor and acceptor pairs with \u03c0-conjugated polymer backbones, exhibit excellent photostability, NIR absorption and enhanced PA effects in brain tumor imaging [181]. Fan et al. established perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic diimide (PDI) nanoparticles, featuring a tertiary amine electron donor and a diimide electron acceptor, for deep brain tumor imaging (Fig. 10a) [194]. Modified with DSPE-mPEG 5000 for water stability, these PDI nanoparticles showed enhanced PA signals in animal models with orthotopic glioblastoma upon continuous 700 nm laser irradiation, highlighting their efficacy through EPR effect and low toxicity (Fig. 10b). The synthetic routes for semiconducting polymeric nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 10c along with their reaction conditions [195]. \n\nJiang et al. developed semiconducting polymer nanoparticles with a donor-acceptor1-donor-acceptor2 structure, specifically poly(diketopyrrolopyrrole-altthiadiazoloquinoxaline), stabilized in water with a PEGb-PPG-b-PEG copolymer. These NPs absorbed in both NIR-I and NIR-II regions, improving brain vasculature visualization in rats using a NIR-II excitation laser 156. The 1064 nm laser yielded PA signals 1.4 times more intense than a 750 nm laser. Additionally, the authors created metabolizable NIR-II PA contrast agents using benzobisthiadiazole encapsulated with biodegradable PLGA-PEG, degraded by myeloperoxidase in phagocytes (Fig. 10d). The principle of using DSPE-mPEG NPs as PA agents for brain imaging. The lipids based DSPE-mPEG structure provided stability and functionality.",

                    "text": "As a top-down coating approach, the use of biological materials is able to bestow synthesized nanoparticles with native cell functionalities [25]. In particular, by extracting the entire membrane from single cells and then linking cell membranes components to the surface of nanoprobes, all biologically relevant surface moieties are transferred and maintained for the biomimetic nanoplatform, such as their biocompatibility, retention of cellular properties, and adaptability [26][27][28]. For example, nanoparticles coating with red blood cell membrane can prolong their circulation time and reduce the accelerated blood clearance [29,30]. In addition, it was discovered that nanoprobes coated with active cell membranes can open a new avenue for passing BBB and targeting glioma [31,32]. Therefore, due to the preserved antigen and cell membrane structure, biomimetic nanoprobes can acquire special functions such as ligand recognition and targeting, long blood circulation and immune escape [33], providing a promising way for the diagnosis of brain tumors. \n\nFurther, multifunctional nanoprobes can serve as the contrast agents for high-sensitivity brain tumor detection [31,34]. In particular, semiconducting polymer dots (Pdots) have received extensive attention in biomedicine due to their outstanding biocompatibility, superior photostability, attractive optoelectronic properties, and abundant functional groups [35][36][37]. More importantly, luminescent conjugated polymers with NIR-II fluorescence properties were inspected, which were able to offer significant improvement for real-time imaging and glioma detection [38][39][40]. For example, Wu et al. developed NIR-II aggregation-induced emission (AIE) active Pdots with enhanced NIR-II fluorescence for through-skull mouse-brain imaging [41]. However, Pdots as exogenous materials, are easily identified by the immune system and quickly cleared by the liver and kidney before they can be transported into the brain [42]. Besides, pure Pdots have difficulties in crossing BBB, showing no specific targeting to brain tumor tissue.",

In particular, by extracting the entire membrane from single cells and then linking cell membranes components to the surface of nanoprobes, all biologically relevant surface moieties are transferred and maintained for the biomimetic nanoplatform, such as their biocompatibility, retention of cellular properties, and adaptability [26][27][28]. For example, nanoparticles coating with red blood cell membrane can prolong their circulation time and reduce the accelerated blood clearance [29,30]. In addition, it was discovered that nanoprobes coated with active cell membranes can open a new avenue for passing BBB and targeting glioma [31,32]. Therefore, due to the preserved antigen and cell membrane structure, biomimetic nanoprobes can acquire special functions such as ligand recognition and targeting, long blood circulation and immune escape [33], providing a promising way for the diagnosis of brain tumors. \n\nFurther, multifunctional nanoprobes can serve as the contrast agents for high-sensitivity brain tumor detection [31,34]. In particular, semiconducting polymer dots (Pdots) have received extensive attention in biomedicine due to their outstanding biocompatibility, superior photostability, attractive optoelectronic properties, and abundant functional groups [35][36][37]. More importantly, luminescent conjugated polymers with NIR-II fluorescence properties were inspected, which were able to offer significant improvement for real-time imaging and glioma detection [38][39][40]. For example, Wu et al. developed NIR-II aggregation-induced emission (AIE) active Pdots with enhanced NIR-II fluorescence for through-skull mouse-brain imaging [41]. However, Pdots as exogenous materials, are easily identified by the immune system and quickly cleared by the liver and kidney before they can be transported into the brain [42]. Besides, pure Pdots have difficulties in crossing BBB, showing no specific targeting to brain tumor tissue.",

However, the detection of cancer in the early stage has been hindered by the intrinsic limits of conventional cancer diagnostic methods. Nanotechnology provides high sensitivity, specificity, and multiplexed measurement capacity and has therefore been investigated for the detection of extracellular cancer biomarkers and cancer cells, as well as for in vivo imaging. This review summarizes the latest developments in nanotechnology applications for cancer diagnosis. In addition, the challenges in the translation of nanotechnology-based diagnostic methods into clinical applications are discussed.",

The PDs bioconjugates were able to label cellular targets in an effective and specific manner, including a cell surface marker on human breast cancer cells, with no need to detect nonspecific binding. The authors demonstrated that the fluorescence exhibited by PDlabeled MCF-7 cells was 25 times higher than that of QDlabeled cells and 18 times higher than that of Alexa Fluor-labeled cells, according to flow cytometry analysis [67]. Based on the results, the authors believe that these ultrabright nanoparticles were successfully bioconjugated. Thus, this strategy provides a new opportunity for applying versatile semiconducting polymers to different fluorescence measurement methods in biomedicine and modern biology. \n\nUpconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) are usually selected for fluorescent labeling considering the ability to excite UCNPs with near-infrared (NIR) light to infrared (IR) light for generation of fluorescence emission in the visible region of the spectrum, leading to minimal background noise. Furthermore, applying NIR light as the excitation source prevents damage to normal tissues on one hand and allows deep tissue penetration on the other hand [68]. \n\nShen et al. [69] described a simple method to conjugate multifunctional nanoparticles (MFNPs) assembled by the formation of various layers with a monoclonal anti-HER2 antibody and confirmed that the MFNPs exhibited the specific detection of breast cancer BT474 cells (biomarker HER2 positive) with a high signal-to-noise ratio. The MFNPs have an obvious core-shell structure of UCNP@-Fe3O4@Au coated with anti-HER2 antibody and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and exhibited an outstanding dispersity in different aqueous solutions and a high signalto-noise ratio.",

Due to their high quantum yields, QDs are helpful in the detection of materials with low abundance. However, to enhance QD electrical characteristics, Pang et al. [52] hybridized ZnO NDs and g-C3N4 QDs to afford higher photoelectron transfer and separation efficiency. Due to the outstanding advantages, ZnO NDs and g-C3N4 QDs enjoyed the extended application, and a photocatalyzed renewable self-powered cytosensing device was presented on the basis of ZnO NDs@g-C3N4 QDs. Through conjugation to the membrane PTK7-specific aptamer Sgc8c, the device was used to detect CCRF-CEM cells (human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells), which express PTK7. The results showed that the device offers better performance in terms of detection range, detection limit, selectivity, and reproducibility. It captured only CCRF-CEM cells (500 cell/mL) and no other cell types, such as HL-60, K562, and HeLa cells. The authors think that the device could be an effective platform for monitoring the progression of leukemia and shows great promise. \n\nPolymer nanoparticles derived from various conductive hydrophobic polymers have been applied to produce nanoparticles with high quantum yields, photostability and that are nontoxic. Therefore, PD is ideal for CTC detection. Wu et al. [66] reported a strategy for semiconducting polymer dots (PDs) functionalization through entrapment of heterogeneous polymer chains into a single dot, which was facilitated by hydrophobic interactions, during nanoparticle formation. A few amphiphilic polymers with functional groups for subsequent covalent conjugation of biomolecules, such as streptavidin and immunoglobulin G (IgG), show co-condensation with most semiconducting polymers for modification and functionalization of a nanoparticle surface.",

However, the detection of cancer in the early stage has been hindered by the intrinsic limits of conventional cancer diagnostic methods. Nanotechnology provides high sensitivity, specificity, and multiplexed measurement capacity and has therefore been investigated for the detection of extracellular cancer biomarkers and cancer cells, as well as for in vivo imaging. This review summarizes the latest developments in nanotechnology applications for cancer diagnosis. In addition, the challenges in the translation of nanotechnology-based diagnostic methods into clinical applications are discussed.\n## Nanotechnology for detection of cancer cells Detection of circulating tumor cells\nQDs are characterized by special optical properties, which enhance their usefulness in cancer cell detection [65]. Due to their high quantum yields, QDs are helpful in the detection of materials with low abundance. However, to enhance QD electrical characteristics, Pang et al. [52] hybridized ZnO NDs and g-C3N4 QDs to afford higher photoelectron transfer and separation efficiency. Due to the outstanding advantages, ZnO NDs and g-C3N4 QDs enjoyed the extended application, and a photocatalyzed renewable self-powered cytosensing device was presented on the basis of ZnO NDs@g-C3N4 QDs. Through conjugation to the membrane PTK7-specific aptamer Sgc8c, the device was used to detect CCRF-CEM cells (human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells), which express PTK7. The results showed that the device offers better performance in terms of detection range, detection limit, selectivity, and reproducibility. It captured only CCRF-CEM cells (500 cell/mL) and no other cell types, such as HL-60, K562, and HeLa cells. The authors think that the device could be an effective platform for monitoring the progression of leukemia and shows great promise. \n\nPolymer nanoparticles derived from various conductive hydrophobic polymers have been applied to produce nanoparticles with high quantum yields, photostability and that are nontoxic. Therefore, PD is ideal for CTC detection. Wu et al. [66] reported a strategy for semiconducting polymer dots (PDs) functionalization through entrapment of heterogeneous polymer chains into a single dot, which was facilitated by hydrophobic interactions, during nanoparticle formation. A few amphiphilic polymers with functional groups for subsequent covalent conjugation of biomolecules, such as streptavidin and immunoglobulin G (IgG), show co-condensation with most semiconducting polymers for modification and functionalization of a nanoparticle surface.\n...\nA few amphiphilic polymers with functional groups for subsequent covalent conjugation of biomolecules, such as streptavidin and immunoglobulin G (IgG), show co-condensation with most semiconducting polymers for modification and functionalization of a nanoparticle surface. The PDs bioconjugates were able to label cellular targets in an effective and specific manner, including a cell surface marker on human breast cancer cells, with no need to detect nonspecific binding. The authors demonstrated that the fluorescence exhibited by PDlabeled MCF-7 cells was 25 times higher than that of QDlabeled cells and 18 times higher than that of Alexa Fluor-labeled cells, according to flow cytometry analysis [67]. Based on the results, the authors believe that these ultrabright nanoparticles were successfully bioconjugated. Thus, this strategy provides a new opportunity for applying versatile semiconducting polymers to different fluorescence measurement methods in biomedicine and modern biology. \n\nUpconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) are usually selected for fluorescent labeling considering the ability to excite UCNPs with near-infrared (NIR) light to infrared (IR) light for generation of fluorescence emission in the visible region of the spectrum, leading to minimal background noise. Furthermore, applying NIR light as the excitation source prevents damage to normal tissues on one hand and allows deep tissue penetration on the other hand [68]. \n\nShen et al. [69] described a simple method to conjugate multifunctional nanoparticles (MFNPs) assembled by the formation of various layers with a monoclonal anti-HER2 antibody and confirmed that the MFNPs exhibited the specific detection of breast cancer BT474 cells (biomarker HER2 positive) with a high signal-to-noise ratio. The MFNPs have an obvious core-shell structure of UCNP@-Fe3O4@Au coated with anti-HER2 antibody and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and exhibited an outstanding dispersity in different aqueous solutions and a high signalto-noise ratio.",

            "abstract": "Background The overall survival rate of osteosarcoma (OS) patients has not been improved for 30\u2009years, and the diagnosis and treatment of OS is still a critical issue. To improve OS treatment and prognosis, novel kinds of theranostic modalities are required. Molecular optical imaging and phototherapy, including photothermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT), are promising strategies for cancer theranostics that exhibit high imaging sensitivity as well as favorable therapeutic efficacy with minimal side effect. In this study, semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPN-PT) for OS-targeted PTT/PDT are designed and prepared, using a semiconducting polymer (PCPDTBT), providing fluorescent emission in the second near-infrared window (NIR-II, 1000 - 1700\u2009nm) and photoacoustic (PA) signal in the first near-infrared window (NIR-I, 650 - 900\u2009nm), served as the photosensitizer, and a polyethylene glycolylated (PEGylated) peptide PT, providing targeting ability to OS. Results The results showed that SPN-PT nanoparticles significantly accelerated OS-specific cellular uptake and enhanced therapeutic efficiency of PTT and PDT effects in OS cell lines and xenograft mouse models. SPN-PT carried out significant anti-tumor activities against OS both in vitro and in vivo. Conclusions Peptide-based semiconducting polymer nanoparticles permit efficient NIR-II fluorescence/NIR-I PA dual-modal imaging and targeted PTT/PDT for OS. Graphic Abstract",

The so-called phototheranostics which combines phototherapies and optical imaging not only permits precise administration of phototherapies under imaging guidance, but also realizes real-time therapeutic effects monitoring, thus reduces side effects and prevents recurrence. Therefore, development of biomaterials for NIR-II fluorescence/ PA imaging-based phototheranostic systems is highly demanded. \n\nTo date, however, the uptake of biomaterials into tumor tissues and cells is mostly the controversial enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) [20][21][22]. It has been recommended that active transcytosis techniques be developed for delivery efficiency enhancement [21,23], including utilization of tumorpenetrating peptides [24] and design of polymer conjugates [25]. Providing with high binding affinity and specificity to certain extracellular ligands, targeting peptides possess advantages including convenient synthesis and easy chemical modification, good histocompatibility, low immunogenicity, favorable pharmacokinetics, and acceptable in vivo stability and integrity [26,27], and have emerged as an alternative to molecular targeting ligands [28]. Among these, peptide PT (PPSHTPT) has been constructed to mimic natural protein osteocalcin property in vivo and has shown its targeted binding to osteosarcoma in vitro and in vivo [29][30][31]. \n\nHerein, we report an oligopeptide PT based semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPN-PT), which shows OS targeting ability, for NIR-II fluorescence and NIR-I PA dual-modal imaging guided PTT and PDT therapies. Semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) represent an emerging class of organic photonic agents fabricated by optically active semiconducting polymers [32], which have been tremendously explored for the applications such as fluorescence imaging [33], PA imaging [34], PTT [35] and PDT [36].",

Graphic Abstract\n## Graphic Abstract\nand noninvasiveness compared with traditional chemotherapies and radiotherapies [18,19]. The so-called phototheranostics which combines phototherapies and optical imaging not only permits precise administration of phototherapies under imaging guidance, but also realizes real-time therapeutic effects monitoring, thus reduces side effects and prevents recurrence. Therefore, development of biomaterials for NIR-II fluorescence/ PA imaging-based phototheranostic systems is highly demanded. \n\nTo date, however, the uptake of biomaterials into tumor tissues and cells is mostly the controversial enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) [20][21][22]. It has been recommended that active transcytosis techniques be developed for delivery efficiency enhancement [21,23], including utilization of tumorpenetrating peptides [24] and design of polymer conjugates [25]. Providing with high binding affinity and specificity to certain extracellular ligands, targeting peptides possess advantages including convenient synthesis and easy chemical modification, good histocompatibility, low immunogenicity, favorable pharmacokinetics, and acceptable in vivo stability and integrity [26,27], and have emerged as an alternative to molecular targeting ligands [28]. Among these, peptide PT (PPSHTPT) has been constructed to mimic natural protein osteocalcin property in vivo and has shown its targeted binding to osteosarcoma in vitro and in vivo [29][30][31]. \n\nHerein, we report an oligopeptide PT based semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPN-PT), which shows OS targeting ability, for NIR-II fluorescence and NIR-I PA dual-modal imaging guided PTT and PDT therapies. Semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) represent an emerging class of organic photonic agents fabricated by optically active semiconducting polymers [32], which have been tremendously explored for the applications such as fluorescence imaging [33], PA imaging [34], PTT [35] and PDT [36].",

PDT directly inhibits local tumors by a minimally invasive strategy, but it seems to be incapable of achieving complete eradication and fails to prevent metastasis and recurrence. Recently, increasing events proved that PDT was associated with immunotherapy by triggering immunogenic cell death (ICD). Upon a specific wavelength of light irradiation, the photosensitizers will turn the surrounding oxygen molecules into cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) for killing the cancer cells. Simultaneously, the dying tumor cells release tumor-associated antigens, which could improve immunogenicity to activate immune cells. However, the progressively enhanced immunity is typically limited by the intrinsic immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). To overcome this obstacle, immuno-photodynamic therapy (IPDT) has come to be one of the most beneficial strategies, which takes advantage of PDT to stimulate the immune response and unite immunotherapy for inducing immune-OFF tumors to immune-ON ones, to achieve systemic immune response and prevent cancer recurrence. In this Perspective, we provide a review of recent advances in organic photosensitizer-based IPDT. The general process of immune responses triggered by photosensitizers (PSs) and how to enhance the antitumor immune pathway by modifying the chemical structure or conjugating with a targeting component was discussed. In addition, future perspectives and challenges associated with IPDT strategies are also discussed. We hope this Perspective could inspire more innovative ideas and provide executable strategies for future developments in the war against cancer.",

            "abstract": "Abstract. Significance: Deep tissue noninvasive high-resolution imaging with light is challenging due to the high degree of light absorption and scattering in biological tissue. Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) can overcome some of the challenges of pure optical or ultrasound imaging to provide high-resolution deep tissue imaging. However, label-free PAI signals from light absorbing chromophores within the tissue are nonspecific. The use of exogeneous contrast agents (probes) not only enhances the imaging contrast (and imaging depth) but also increases the specificity of PAI by binding only to targeted molecules and often providing signals distinct from the background. Aim: We aim to review the current development and future progression of photoacoustic molecular probes/contrast agents. Approach: First, PAI and the need for using contrast agents are briefly introduced. Then, the recent development of contrast agents in terms of materials used to construct them is discussed. Then, various probes are discussed based on targeting mechanisms, in vivo molecular imaging applications, multimodal uses, and use in theranostic applications. Results: Material combinations are being used to develop highly specific contrast agents. In addition to passive accumulation, probes utilizing activation mechanisms show promise for greater controllability. Several probes also enable concurrent multimodal use with fluorescence, ultrasound, Raman, magnetic resonance imaging, and computed tomography. Finally, targeted probes are also shown to aid localized and molecularly specific photo-induced therapy. Conclusions: The development of contrast agents provides a promising prospect for increased contrast, higher imaging depth, and molecularly specific information. Of note are agents that allow for controlled activation, explore other optical windows, and enable multimodal use to overcome some of the shortcomings of label-free PAI.",

                    "text": "Semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) are advanced organic materials that have been applied in many imaging modalities, including fluorescent imaging, US imaging, and PAI. The advantages of SPNs are numerous and include large absorption coefficient, tunable absorption, high photostability, low toxicity, 86 high structural flexibility, small size, and higher PA signal generation than single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and AuNRs. 210 As an imaging probe to localize specific diseases or tissues, SPNs can produce PA signals in the sites of interest, relying on simple accumulation via the retention effect or receptor binding on the cell surface. This strategy leads to the application of LN mapping, 210 in vivo tumor-targeted imaging, [211][212][213] cell tracking, 214 and ROS mapping. 134 For example, SPN with poly as cyclopentadithiophene-altbenzothiadiazole showed a maximum NIR-I absorption at 660 nm and maximum PA signals at 690 nm, and it was used as PAI probes for lymphatic imaging. 210 Another recently reported SPNs, which was fabricated into water-dispersed NPs, showed strong absorption in the NIR-II window and efficient cellular uptake, leading to effective accumulation in subcutaneous tumors and brain tumors. 212 ther than the simple accumulation of agents, SPNs also can be employed as activable PA probes with biomarker-triggered signals, which offer measurable and quantifiable real-time information on pathological status at the molecular level. Such smart PA probes have been used for in vivo imaging of a variety of biomarkers and biological metabolites in recent years, including abnormal pH, 215 different ROS imaging (such as ONOO \u2212 and CLO \u2212 level, 134,210 O2 \u2022\u2212 level 216 ), and granzyme B. 104 The reader can refer to Ref. 104 for more details on activatable SP nanoprobe (SPNP), which was reported as a biomarker to detect granzyme B in the tumors of living mice. Granzyme B can be considered to be a signature of immune activation due to elevated concentration in cytotoxic T lymphocytes.",

A. Malik, M. Pramanik\n## Abstract\nAbstract. Significance: Deep tissue noninvasive high-resolution imaging with light is challenging due to the high degree of light absorption and scattering in biological tissue. Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) can overcome some of the challenges of pure optical or ultrasound imaging to provide high-resolution deep tissue imaging. However, label-free PAI signals from light absorbing chromophores within the tissue are nonspecific. The use of exogeneous contrast agents (probes) not only enhances the imaging contrast (and imaging depth) but also increases the specificity of PAI by binding only to targeted molecules and often providing signals distinct from the background. Aim: We aim to review the current development and future progression of photoacoustic molecular probes/contrast agents. Approach: First, PAI and the need for using contrast agents are briefly introduced. Then, the recent development of contrast agents in terms of materials used to construct them is discussed. Then, various probes are discussed based on targeting mechanisms, in vivo molecular imaging applications, multimodal uses, and use in theranostic applications. Results: Material combinations are being used to develop highly specific contrast agents. In addition to passive accumulation, probes utilizing activation mechanisms show promise for greater controllability. Several probes also enable concurrent multimodal use with fluorescence, ultrasound, Raman, magnetic resonance imaging, and computed tomography. Finally, targeted probes are also shown to aid localized and molecularly specific photo-induced therapy. Conclusions: The development of contrast agents provides a promising prospect for increased contrast, higher imaging depth, and molecularly specific information. Of note are agents that allow for controlled activation, explore other optical windows, and enable multimodal use to overcome some of the shortcomings of label-free PAI.\n## Semiconducting Polymer Nanoparticles\nSemiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) are advanced organic materials that have been applied in many imaging modalities, including fluorescent imaging, US imaging, and PAI. The advantages of SPNs are numerous and include large absorption coefficient, tunable absorption, high photostability, low toxicity, 86 high structural flexibility, small size, and higher PA signal generation than single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and AuNRs. 210 As an imaging probe to localize specific diseases or tissues, SPNs can produce PA signals in the sites of interest, relying on simple accumulation via the retention effect or receptor binding on the cell surface. This strategy leads to the application of LN mapping, 210 in vivo tumor-targeted imaging, [211][212][213] cell tracking, 214 and ROS mapping. 134 For example, SPN with poly as cyclopentadithiophene-altbenzothiadiazole showed a maximum NIR-I absorption at 660 nm and maximum PA signals at 690 nm, and it was used as PAI probes for lymphatic imaging. 210 Another recently reported SPNs, which was fabricated into water-dispersed NPs, showed strong absorption in the NIR-II window and efficient cellular uptake, leading to effective accumulation in subcutaneous tumors and brain tumors. 212 ther than the simple accumulation of agents, SPNs also can be employed as activable PA probes with biomarker-triggered signals, which offer measurable and quantifiable real-time information on pathological status at the molecular level. Such smart PA probes have been used for in vivo imaging of a variety of biomarkers and biological metabolites in recent years, including abnormal pH, 215 different ROS imaging (such as ONOO \u2212 and CLO \u2212 level, 134,210 O2 \u2022\u2212 level 216 ), and granzyme B. 104 The reader can refer to Ref. 104 for more details on activatable SP nanoprobe (SPNP), which was reported as a biomarker to detect granzyme B in the tumors of living mice. Granzyme B can be considered to be a signature of immune activation due to elevated concentration in cytotoxic T lymphocytes.",

                    "text": "Besides the super photostability and high biocompatibility, the semiconducting polymer NPs can be easily surface functionalized or facilely conjugated with biomolecules for different purposes, e.g., for larger absorption range or loading capacity [55,118,139]. Tang et al. developed a nanocarrier based on the photoreactive oxetane groups modified semiconducting polymer to dope with Chlorin e6 (Ce6), which was called Ce6-doped semiconducting polymer dots (Ce6-Pdots). After UV photo-crosslinking, a polymeric network was formed due to the reactions between the modified side chains to prevent the retained Ce6 leakage. Because the emission range of the nanocarrier overlaps with the Ce6 absorption range, upon green light (520 nm) irradiation, the semiconducting polymer can transfer the excitation energy to the Ce6 and then efficient 1 O 2 were generated. Compared with Ce6 alone, the energy transfer process can avoid the relatively high dose of light irradiation and due to the large absorption cross section of the semiconducting polymer-based nanocarrier, the 1 O 2 generation was amplified, which resulted in highly effective in vitro PDT effect even with low NPs concentration (10 \u03bcg/mL) and light dose (60 J/cm 2 ) and the in vivo tumor growth was apparently inhibited after the PDT treatment [140]. NPs can also protect PSs from inactivation and degradation in the complex biological environment. For example, ICG, which is a PSs approved by U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for clinical treatment and imaging, still suffers from the instability in aqueous solution, which hinder its PDT efficacy. To improve its therapeutic effect, Yang et al. fabricated ICG-oxygen nanobubbles (named as ICG-NBs-O 2 ) through assembling the free ICG molecules with NBs-O 2 . The NPs assembly occurred on the gas-liquid interface due to the hydrophilic-hydrophobic interaction.",

Fontana, C. Tapeinos, M. Shahbazi, Huijie Han, H. Santos\n## Abstract\nNone\n## Organic NPs-based PTT\nFor example, croconaine-loaded NPs, which were reported by Li et al., have shown high contrast in PAI, enabling a real time monitoring of NPs accumulation within the tumor [115]. Furthermore, the authors used croconaines with different adsorption wavelength to compare the accumulation of targeted and untargeted NPs; the irradiation of the particles with the 808 nm laser set at 1.0 W determined a photothermal conversion of 30  C upon irradiation with 0.8 W/cm 2 for 5 min at 808 nm. The system was encapsulated within cancer cell membrane to improve the targeting to the tumor tissue upon intravenous administration [117]. Semiconducting polymeric NPs are characterized by a photoactivable semiconducting polymeric core, which allows PTT, as well as PA or fluorescent imaging of tumors [118]. \n\nThe main advantage of semiconducting polymeric NPs over other organic NPs for PTT is the presence of the photoactivator in the polymer, which is then precipitated into particles, compared to the loading of a molecule like indocyanine. Furthermore, the structure of the semiconducting polymeric NPs can be easily engineered in the backbone to introduce donor-acceptors to shift the absorption from NIR I to NIR II window, with enhanced efficacy vs. lower fluence of the laser and higher safety of the treatment [109,118]. Duan et al. recently reported a modification of two isoindigo-based semiconducting polymeric NPs (identified as PBFT-DIID) to present a strong absorption between 700 and 1000 nm, correlated with a photothermal conversion efficiency of 70.6%, with a concentration dependent increase in the temperature up to 60 \u2022 within 5 min of laser irradiation at 0.5 W/cm 2 , and stable photoactivation in 5 repeated irradiation cycles, correlated with a complete tumor eradication in 4T1 subcutaneous tumor model after 6 min exposure to 0.8 W/cm 2 over the tumor area [119]. Organic nanosystems present lower toxicity compared to the inorganic ones.\n\n## NPs as PDT agent carriers\nBesides the super photostability and high biocompatibility, the semiconducting polymer NPs can be easily surface functionalized or facilely conjugated with biomolecules for different purposes, e.g., for larger absorption range or loading capacity [55,118,139]. Tang et al. developed a nanocarrier based on the photoreactive oxetane groups modified semiconducting polymer to dope with Chlorin e6 (Ce6), which was called Ce6-doped semiconducting polymer dots (Ce6-Pdots). After UV photo-crosslinking, a polymeric network was formed due to the reactions between the modified side chains to prevent the retained Ce6 leakage. Because the emission range of the nanocarrier overlaps with the Ce6 absorption range, upon green light (520 nm) irradiation, the semiconducting polymer can transfer the excitation energy to the Ce6 and then efficient 1 O 2 were generated. Compared with Ce6 alone, the energy transfer process can avoid the relatively high dose of light irradiation and due to the large absorption cross section of the semiconducting polymer-based nanocarrier, the 1 O 2 generation was amplified, which resulted in highly effective in vitro PDT effect even with low NPs concentration (10 \u03bcg/mL) and light dose (60 J/cm 2 ) and the in vivo tumor growth was apparently inhibited after the PDT treatment [140]. NPs can also protect PSs from inactivation and degradation in the complex biological environment. For example, ICG, which is a PSs approved by U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for clinical treatment and imaging, still suffers from the instability in aqueous solution, which hinder its PDT efficacy. To improve its therapeutic effect, Yang et al. fabricated ICG-oxygen nanobubbles (named as ICG-NBs-O 2 ) through assembling the free ICG molecules with NBs-O 2 . The NPs assembly occurred on the gas-liquid interface due to the hydrophilic-hydrophobic interaction.",

Tumor molecular imaging, by enabling the visualization and quantification of molecular characteristics of tumor cells, facilitates a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of tumors, providing valuable insights for early diagnosis, treatment monitoring, and cancer biology research. However, the image quality of molecular imaging still requires improvement, and nanotechnology has significantly propelled the advancement of molecular imaging. Currently, nanoparticle-based tumor molecular imaging technologies encompass radionuclide imaging, fluorescence imaging, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound imaging, photoacoustic imaging, and multimodal imaging, among others. As our understanding of the tumor microenvironment deepens, the design of nanoparticle probes for tumor molecular imaging has also evolved, offering new perspectives and expanding the applications of tumor molecular imaging. Beyond diagnostics, there is a marked trend towards integrated diagnosis and therapy, with image-guided treatment playing a pivotal role. This includes image-guided surgery, photodynamic therapy, and chemodynamic therapy. Despite continuous advancements and innovative developments in molecular imaging, many of these remain in the experimental stage and require breakthroughs before they can be fully integrated into clinical practice.",

Tumor molecular imaging, by enabling the visualization and quantification of molecular characteristics of tumor cells, facilitates a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of tumors, providing valuable insights for early diagnosis, treatment monitoring, and cancer biology research. However, the image quality of molecular imaging still requires improvement, and nanotechnology has significantly propelled the advancement of molecular imaging. Currently, nanoparticle-based tumor molecular imaging technologies encompass radionuclide imaging, fluorescence imaging, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound imaging, photoacoustic imaging, and multimodal imaging, among others. As our understanding of the tumor microenvironment deepens, the design of nanoparticle probes for tumor molecular imaging has also evolved, offering new perspectives and expanding the applications of tumor molecular imaging. Beyond diagnostics, there is a marked trend towards integrated diagnosis and therapy, with image-guided treatment playing a pivotal role. This includes image-guided surgery, photodynamic therapy, and chemodynamic therapy. Despite continuous advancements and innovative developments in molecular imaging, many of these remain in the experimental stage and require breakthroughs before they can be fully integrated into clinical practice.\n## Photoacoustic Molecular Imaging\nemiconductive polymeric NPs represent a significant portion of organic NPs that exhibit photoacoustic and related properties due to their NIR absorption property. Semiconducting polymers offer unique advantages in photoacoustic applications due to their remarkable photostability and biocompatibility, setting them apart from other NPs. Polymeric NPs containing diketopyrrolopyrrole and its derivatives were utilized for enhanced tumor imaging with more than five times higher than the background signal at 2 h of the NP injection. 42 Benzothiadiazole moiety doubled the PA signal provided by the NPs. 43 Organic dyes are continuously under investigation for its photoacoustic contrast capabilities due to their ability to provide a similar enhancement in PAI as polymeric NPs, while also demonstrating significant biocompatibility. 110 Recent studies have found that coupling with phospholipids enhances the effectiveness of porphyrin NPs in PAI. These NPs have also been reported to be a component of photon bubbles, which can serve as CAs for both UI and PAI. 118 n conclusion, the combination of PAI technology with NPs enables high-resolution imaging of biological tissues and cells. By using NPs as CAs, the photoacoustic signal can be enhanced, improving imaging sensitivity and resolution.",

            "abstract": "The last decade has witnessed the growing development of optical imaging using near-infrared (NIR) light (wavelength range: 700\u20131700 nm) in a wide range of applications, from fundamental research of live biological and physiological processes to clinical applications such as disease screening and image-guide surgical interventions. The low-energy NIR light offers reduced tissue scattering, absorption as well as autofluorescence background compared to traditional wavelengths in the visible (400\u2013700 nm) range, thus dramatically enhancing imaging resolution, signal-to-noise ratio, and penetration depth. This Research Topic calls for advances in new fluorescent probes, imaging instrumentation, analytical methods and their applications for improvement of diagnosis and therapy in this \u201ctissue transparent window,\u201d aiming to provide a timely update of this continuously evolving filed. Imaging and diagnosis agents are the cornerstone of preclinical applications. In their study, Tan et al. report lycosin-I peptide modified gold nanoclusters (LGNCs), which exhibit strong NIR fluorescence, for imaging of specific cancer cell nuclei. The lycosin-I peptide not only possesses highly efficient and selective intracellular translocation against several cancer cells, but also induces aggregation of gold nanoclusters to further enhance their brightness. After uptake by tumor cells, the LGNCs aggregates can be depolymerized into ultrasmall nanoclusters by the high level GSH in the tumor microenvironment, facilitating nuclear targeting translocation in cancer cells. Another study by Huang et al. reports a novel biomimetic nanoprobe for photoacoustic (PA) imaging of cervical carcinoma. This probe is constructed by coating indocyanine green (ICG)-loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles with the cancer cell membrane, providing small particle size, excellent dispersion, large loading efficiency, good biocompatibility and homologous targeting ability to Hela cells in vitro. The biomimetic nanoprobe can specifically accumulate into tumor and display a superior PA imaging efficacy compared with free ICG, allowing for non-invasive deep tissue imaging of cervical carcinoma in vivo. Another article by Gu et al. focuses on a particular type of NIR fluorophores, semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs). SPNs are constructed by encapsulating hydrophobic semiconducting polymers (SPs) with amphiphilic copolymers, and have shown great promise for phototheranostics of cancer. The authors review recent advances of thiadiazoloquinoxaline (TQ)-based SPNs from their synthesis and hydrophilic functionalization to NIR-II (1,000\u20131,700 nm) fluorescence imagingguided cancer photothermal therapy (PTT). To enhance the PTT efficiency, they also discuss methods for constructing SPNs with capability of multimodal imaging. Current limitations are summarized at the end that hamper clinical applications of the SPNs, such as relatively large size and low tumor targeting ability.

The low-energy NIR light offers reduced tissue scattering, absorption as well as autofluorescence background compared to traditional wavelengths in the visible (400\u2013700 nm) range, thus dramatically enhancing imaging resolution, signal-to-noise ratio, and penetration depth. This Research Topic calls for advances in new fluorescent probes, imaging instrumentation, analytical methods and their applications for improvement of diagnosis and therapy in this \u201ctissue transparent window,\u201d aiming to provide a timely update of this continuously evolving filed. Imaging and diagnosis agents are the cornerstone of preclinical applications. In their study, Tan et al. report lycosin-I peptide modified gold nanoclusters (LGNCs), which exhibit strong NIR fluorescence, for imaging of specific cancer cell nuclei. The lycosin-I peptide not only possesses highly efficient and selective intracellular translocation against several cancer cells, but also induces aggregation of gold nanoclusters to further enhance their brightness. After uptake by tumor cells, the LGNCs aggregates can be depolymerized into ultrasmall nanoclusters by the high level GSH in the tumor microenvironment, facilitating nuclear targeting translocation in cancer cells. Another study by Huang et al. reports a novel biomimetic nanoprobe for photoacoustic (PA) imaging of cervical carcinoma. This probe is constructed by coating indocyanine green (ICG)-loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles with the cancer cell membrane, providing small particle size, excellent dispersion, large loading efficiency, good biocompatibility and homologous targeting ability to Hela cells in vitro. The biomimetic nanoprobe can specifically accumulate into tumor and display a superior PA imaging efficacy compared with free ICG, allowing for non-invasive deep tissue imaging of cervical carcinoma in vivo. Another article by Gu et al. focuses on a particular type of NIR fluorophores, semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs). SPNs are constructed by encapsulating hydrophobic semiconducting polymers (SPs) with amphiphilic copolymers, and have shown great promise for phototheranostics of cancer. The authors review recent advances of thiadiazoloquinoxaline (TQ)-based SPNs from their synthesis and hydrophilic functionalization to NIR-II (1,000\u20131,700 nm) fluorescence imagingguided cancer photothermal therapy (PTT). To enhance the PTT efficiency, they also discuss methods for constructing SPNs with capability of multimodal imaging.

By exploiting the diverse optical characteristics of various gold nanostructures, significant enhancements can be achieved in biosensing and biomedical imaging fields. The potential of AuNPs can be enhanced by creating hybrid nanocomposites with polymers, which offer supplementary functionalities, responsiveness, and enhanced biocompatibility. Moreover, polymers can modify the surface charges of AuNPs, thereby improving or controlling the efficiency of cellular uptake and the distribution of these nanoparticles within the body. Polymer modification using AuNPs offers a wide array of benefits, including improved sensitivity, specificity, speed, contrast, resolution, and penetration depth. By incorporating AuNPs into the polymer matrix, these enhancements synergistically enhance the overall performance of various applications. This versatile approach opens promising possibilities in fields such as biomedicine, nanotechnology, and sensor development, providing a powerful platform for advanced research and technological innovations. In this review, the recent advancements in polymer-AuNPs synthesis and their applications in bioimaging will be covered. Prospects and challenges associated with polymer-AuNPs-based bioimaging agents in preclinical and clinical investigations will be discussed.",

Their biocompatibility and tunable properties make polymers invaluable for various medical and preclinical applications of photoacoustic imaging, ranging from cancer detection and vascular imaging to monitoring physiological processes in real-time. \n\nPu and colleagues have introduced semiconducting polymer nanoparticles prepared from poly(cyclopentadithiophene-alt-benzothiadiazole) and poly(acenaphthothienopyrazine-alt-benzodithiophene) which absorb near-infrared light as innovative contrast agents for photoacoustic molecular imaging [87]. These nanoparticles outperformed traditional agents like gold nanorods and single-walled carbon nanotubes, delivering enhanced signal strength and enabling real-time, in vivo imaging of reactive oxygen species. When combined with therapeutic agents, this platform holds significant potential as a robust theranostic tool. In another study ma et al. prepared a biodegradable semiconducting polymer from diketopyrrolopyrrole with excellent photoacousitc imaging application in vivo for the \u03bb-carrageenaninduced arthritis mouse model [88]. Polypyrrole based NPs were fabricated by Kesa et. al. and they studied the in vivo applications of these NPs for ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging applications on a mouse model [89]. An intense photoacoustic signal was clearly observed in the anterior wall of the mouse heart after the NPs injection. \n\nThus from the existing literature reports polymers can enhance the bioimaging applications as a carrier for imaging agents or by modulating the surface and conjugation properties of polymers.

By exploiting the diverse optical characteristics of various gold nanostructures, significant enhancements can be achieved in biosensing and biomedical imaging fields. The potential of AuNPs can be enhanced by creating hybrid nanocomposites with polymers, which offer supplementary functionalities, responsiveness, and enhanced biocompatibility. Moreover, polymers can modify the surface charges of AuNPs, thereby improving or controlling the efficiency of cellular uptake and the distribution of these nanoparticles within the body. Polymer modification using AuNPs offers a wide array of benefits, including improved sensitivity, specificity, speed, contrast, resolution, and penetration depth. By incorporating AuNPs into the polymer matrix, these enhancements synergistically enhance the overall performance of various applications. This versatile approach opens promising possibilities in fields such as biomedicine, nanotechnology, and sensor development, providing a powerful platform for advanced research and technological innovations. In this review, the recent advancements in polymer-AuNPs synthesis and their applications in bioimaging will be covered. Prospects and challenges associated with polymer-AuNPs-based bioimaging agents in preclinical and clinical investigations will be discussed.\n## Ultrasound and Photoacoustic Imaging applications\nAdditionally, conducting polymers are utilized in the fabrication of photoacoustic sensors and transducers, contributing to the development of portable and high-resolution imaging devices. Their biocompatibility and tunable properties make polymers invaluable for various medical and preclinical applications of photoacoustic imaging, ranging from cancer detection and vascular imaging to monitoring physiological processes in real-time. \n\nPu and colleagues have introduced semiconducting polymer nanoparticles prepared from poly(cyclopentadithiophene-alt-benzothiadiazole) and poly(acenaphthothienopyrazine-alt-benzodithiophene) which absorb near-infrared light as innovative contrast agents for photoacoustic molecular imaging [87]. These nanoparticles outperformed traditional agents like gold nanorods and single-walled carbon nanotubes, delivering enhanced signal strength and enabling real-time, in vivo imaging of reactive oxygen species. When combined with therapeutic agents, this platform holds significant potential as a robust theranostic tool. In another study ma et al. prepared a biodegradable semiconducting polymer from diketopyrrolopyrrole with excellent photoacousitc imaging application in vivo for the \u03bb-carrageenaninduced arthritis mouse model [88]. Polypyrrole based NPs were fabricated by Kesa et. al. and they studied the in vivo applications of these NPs for ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging applications on a mouse model [89]. An intense photoacoustic signal was clearly observed in the anterior wall of the mouse heart after the NPs injection. \n\nThus from the existing literature reports polymers can enhance the bioimaging applications as a carrier for imaging agents or by modulating the surface and conjugation properties of polymers. Various polymer materials used for bioimaging applications are given in table 1.",

In addition to lowtoxicity QDs, polymer dots based on conjugated semiconducting polymers have been investigated as alternative fluorescent probes without considering the cytotoxicity caused by ionized heavy metals [99]. \n\nThese imaging modalities have various advantages and disadvantages. For instance, MRI, CT, and PET have high penetration depths, however, their spatial resolution is limited to the millimeter scale. In contrast, fluorescent imaging has high spatial resolution at the subcellular scale, however, its penetration depth is limited to a few centimeters. To benefit from each advantage, multimodal imaging has generated considerable research interest in increasing the accuracy of diagnosis using complementary information from different imaging modalities [100]. The fabrication of nanoparticulated imaging probes allows them to exhibit multifunctional characteristics; therefore, the strength of each imaging modality can be integrated into a multimodal nanoparticle. For instance, 64 Cu-labelled and RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) peptide-conjugated iron oxide nanoparticles were developed as PET/MR dual-modality imaging probes for tumor integrin expression, whereas the near-infrared fluorescent (NIRF) dye ZW800 loaded with silica nanoparticles labelled with Gd ions and 64 Cu was developed as PET/MR/optical imaging probe for tumor-draining sentinel lymph nodes [100]. In addition to diagnostic imaging, these multifunctional nanoparticles can also serve to monitor therapeutic efficacy of cancer treatment (theranostics) [101]. For example, croconaine dye-based nanoparticles were developed for photoacoustic/fluorescent imaging-guided photothermal therapy [102], while SPIO and olaparib-loaded exosome extracted from hypoxic cells was investigated for magnetic particle imaging and therapy of hypoxic region in tumor [103].",

In this review, we introduce nanoparticles as a powerful tool in the field of cancer therapy and diagnostics and discuss issues and future prospects.\n## Exogenous Nanoparticle-Based In Vivo Diagnostic Imaging\nTherefore, QDs composed of less toxic semiconducting nanocrystals (e.g., indium phosphide and silicon) have attracted considerable attention as bright and biocompatible probes for fluorescence bioimaging [98]. In addition to lowtoxicity QDs, polymer dots based on conjugated semiconducting polymers have been investigated as alternative fluorescent probes without considering the cytotoxicity caused by ionized heavy metals [99]. \n\nThese imaging modalities have various advantages and disadvantages. For instance, MRI, CT, and PET have high penetration depths, however, their spatial resolution is limited to the millimeter scale. In contrast, fluorescent imaging has high spatial resolution at the subcellular scale, however, its penetration depth is limited to a few centimeters. To benefit from each advantage, multimodal imaging has generated considerable research interest in increasing the accuracy of diagnosis using complementary information from different imaging modalities [100]. The fabrication of nanoparticulated imaging probes allows them to exhibit multifunctional characteristics; therefore, the strength of each imaging modality can be integrated into a multimodal nanoparticle. For instance, 64 Cu-labelled and RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) peptide-conjugated iron oxide nanoparticles were developed as PET/MR dual-modality imaging probes for tumor integrin expression, whereas the near-infrared fluorescent (NIRF) dye ZW800 loaded with silica nanoparticles labelled with Gd ions and 64 Cu was developed as PET/MR/optical imaging probe for tumor-draining sentinel lymph nodes [100]. In addition to diagnostic imaging, these multifunctional nanoparticles can also serve to monitor therapeutic efficacy of cancer treatment (theranostics) [101]. For example, croconaine dye-based nanoparticles were developed for photoacoustic/fluorescent imaging-guided photothermal therapy [102], while SPIO and olaparib-loaded exosome extracted from hypoxic cells was investigated for magnetic particle imaging and therapy of hypoxic region in tumor [103].",

            "text": "Semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs), often also referred to as conjugated polymer nanoparticles or polymer dots, are an emerging class of cancer theranostics.Their utility stems from their high absorption coefficients, biocompatibility, photostability, and fluorescent brightness. [1,2]SPNs are typically formed from the self-assembly of semiconducting polymers (SPs).The hydrophobic nature of the polymers makes nanoparticle formation a thermodynamically favorable process.However, this hydrophobicity also decreases colloidal stability in aqueous buffer and promotes protein adhesion, leading to protein coronas.A common way to improve colloidal stability and reduce biofouling is to coprecipitate the semiconducting polymer with amphiphilic block copolymers, lipids, or surfactants.These additives shield the hydrophobic polymers from the aqueous environment.However, the resulting binary micelles may be prone to heterogeneity, require purification, and raise questions of short-and long-term stability in a biological context. [3]o circumvent the issues caused by coprecipitation, singlecomponent systems have been explored.These commonly consist of graft copolymers of SPs with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) side chains.[6][7][8] In addition, the optoelectronic performance of graft copolymers for cancer theranostics has been shown to be improved when compared to coprecipitation. [9,10]However, graft copolymer synthesis is typically complex and potentially difficult to scale, often requiring the multistep functionalization and purification of monomer precursors and various postpolymerization modifications. [3,8]n the vast majority of SPN studies for cancer targeting, accumulation of the nanoparticles at the tumor site relies on passive tumor targeting, thanks to the enhanced permeability and retention effect, which is thought to be relevant in some but not all solid tumors.

In a following study, the same author and coworkers [89] highlighted the feasibility of diketopyrrolopyrrole-(DPP-) based SPNs for in vivo PAI on a HeLa xenograft mouse model. After IV administration, DPP-SPNs exhibited a significantly higher PA signal in tumor than surrounding tissues, presumably due to extravasation of SPNs through cancer blood vessels. ese studies provided the first insights about the potential of SPNs for high-resolution PAI in oncological research.\n\nFurther improvements in biodistribution of amphiphilic polymers containing DPP-SPNs have been obtained through PEGylation [90], overcoming also the potential issue of their dissociation. In a proof of concept study, the ability of these amphiphilic SPNs for in vivo tumor imaging was demonstrated at 24 hours after IV injection.\n\nAttempts for advances in diagnostic specificity and sensitivity are also in progress through implementation of multispectral PAI. Zhang and colleagues [91] developed semiconducting polymer dots (Pdots), which include in their structure isoindigo (IID) and 4,7-dithien-2-yl-2,1,3benzothiadiazole (DTBT) as electron acceptors. is chemical modification, consisting in incorporation of an electron-deficient element into the SPNs structure, is known as the \"self-quenched process,",

            "text": "For example, croconaine-loaded NPs, which were reported by Li et al., have shown high contrast in PAI, enabling a real time monitoring of NPs accumulation within the tumor [115]. Furthermore, the authors used croconaines with different adsorption wavelength to compare the accumulation of targeted and untargeted NPs; the irradiation of the particles with the 808 nm laser set at 1.0 W determined a photothermal conversion of 30  C upon irradiation with 0.8 W/cm 2 for 5 min at 808 nm. The system was encapsulated within cancer cell membrane to improve the targeting to the tumor tissue upon intravenous administration [117]. Semiconducting polymeric NPs are characterized by a photoactivable semiconducting polymeric core, which allows PTT, as well as PA or fluorescent imaging of tumors [118]. \n\nThe main advantage of semiconducting polymeric NPs over other organic NPs for PTT is the presence of the photoactivator in the polymer, which is then precipitated into particles, compared to the loading of a molecule like indocyanine. Furthermore, the structure of the semiconducting polymeric NPs can be easily engineered in the backbone to introduce donor-acceptors to shift the absorption from NIR I to NIR II window, with enhanced efficacy vs. lower fluence of the laser and higher safety of the treatment [109,118]. Duan et al. recently reported a modification of two isoindigo-based semiconducting polymeric NPs (identified as PBFT-DIID) to present a strong absorption between 700 and 1000 nm, correlated with a photothermal conversion efficiency of 70.6%, with a concentration dependent increase in the temperature up to 60 \u2022 within 5 min of laser irradiation at 0.5 W/cm 2 , and stable photoactivation in 5 repeated irradiation cycles, correlated with a complete tumor eradication in 4T1 subcutaneous tumor model after 6 min exposure to 0.8 W/cm 2 over the tumor area [119].

            "text": "Conducting polymers (CPs), a group of polymers exhibiting good electrical conductivity (10 \u221211 to 10 3 S/cm with a carrier concentration ranging between 10 12 and 10 19 /cm 3 ), have been used to increase the detection sensitivity of protein detection systems such as FETs [11,81,90,91]. The following section overviews various use of polymeric materials in each area of protein detection, with an emphasis on their role to increase selectivity and sensitivity of desired measurements. Table 2 classifies various polymers used in protein detection according to their assorted properties and relevance in each detection category. In Optical Detection. Currently, optical detection methods are predominantly employed in basic biological and biomedical research as well as in biotechnology applications. A large number of such optical protein assays involves polymeric supports as detection platforms. Therefore, the role of polymers in this detection area is becoming increasingly important and their application is rapidly expanding. Before their use, several key characteristics of a polymer are carefully assessed before its use. Examples of evaluated criteria for a candidate polymeric material may include biocompatibility and biostability. They are also screened for the physical, biological, and optical properties typically required for protein measurements. Commonly and widely-used fluorescence-based detection requires particular optical properties from candidate polymeric materials including low intrinsic fluorescence background and high optical transparency to the excitation and emission wavelengths which are typically used in fluorescence measurements. \n\nDespite the wide availability of polymers in general, these requirements restrict their application in biodetection to a smaller subset of polymers demonstrating the desired characteristics. For example, polycarbonate (PC), polyurethane (PU), polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), polystyrene (PS), polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), cycloolefin-based polymers, and combinations of these polymeric materials have been used to a great extent in the past. Modifications to the physical and chemical structures of these workhorse polymers have expanded their use to a certain degree. In addition to the macroscopic scale polymers produced via thermal and injection molding, polymeric nanofibers generated via an electrospinning process have been utilized in protein assays to provide an increased surface area for protein assembly [92,93].",

            "text": "Biomaterials are ubiquitous in biomedical research, and have had some notable impacts in cancer therapy over the past few decades. Thus far, most of these advances -at least clinically -have involved improving the solubility, reducing the toxicity, or increasing the half-life of small molecule chemotherapeutics such as doxorubicin. These improvements illustrate a few of the properties that make biomaterials of great interest for cancer immunotherapy. Speaking generally, \"biomaterial\" is a term that spans natural or synthetic polymers, lipids, metal contrast agents, engineered cells, quantum dots, and a multitude of selfassembled structures. These materials are often used to build implantable scaffolds or devices [9,10], as sensitive biosensors on functionalized surfaces within microfluidic devices [11,12], or to formulate nanoparticles (NPs) or microparticles (MPs) that can be delivered or conjugated to cells ex vivo or in vivo [13]. One classic advantage of biomaterials is the co-delivery of cargo by encapsulating two or more cargos (e.g., small molecule drugs) in a biodegradable polymeric particle. This approach is frequently used to ensure cells or tissues receive each cargo type to work in synergy, or -by synthesizing polymers with an appropriate degradation rate -to achieve a desired sustained release profile. In addition to co-delivery and controlled release, many particlebased strategies are aimed at improved targeting by surface conjugation of antibodies or ligands for receptors expressed on target cells or tissues. \n\nAnother important focus of biomaterials has been in protecting biologic cargo from degradation in the presence of enzymes or extreme pH, and to reduce systemic toxicity by allowing drug to be slowly released over time or upon reaching target tissues such as tumors. This has been particularly important in cancer, where increasing the circulation time of drugs through modification with polyethylene glycol or other molecules has led to better tumor targeting; targeting occurs because of the leaky tumor vascular that causes preferential accumulation at tumors through the enhanced-permeability and retention (EPR) effect [14].",

Due to their high quantum yields, QDs are helpful in the detection of materials with low abundance. However, to enhance QD electrical characteristics, Pang et al. [52] hybridized ZnO NDs and g-C3N4 QDs to afford higher photoelectron transfer and separation efficiency. Due to the outstanding advantages, ZnO NDs and g-C3N4 QDs enjoyed the extended application, and a photocatalyzed renewable self-powered cytosensing device was presented on the basis of ZnO NDs@g-C3N4 QDs. Through conjugation to the membrane PTK7-specific aptamer Sgc8c, the device was used to detect CCRF-CEM cells (human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells), which express PTK7. The results showed that the device offers better performance in terms of detection range, detection limit, selectivity, and reproducibility. It captured only CCRF-CEM cells (500 cell/mL) and no other cell types, such as HL-60, K562, and HeLa cells. The authors think that the device could be an effective platform for monitoring the progression of leukemia and shows great promise. \n\nPolymer nanoparticles derived from various conductive hydrophobic polymers have been applied to produce nanoparticles with high quantum yields, photostability and that are nontoxic. Therefore, PD is ideal for CTC detection. Wu et al. [66] reported a strategy for semiconducting polymer dots (PDs) functionalization through entrapment of heterogeneous polymer chains into a single dot, which was facilitated by hydrophobic interactions, during nanoparticle formation. A few amphiphilic polymers with functional groups for subsequent covalent conjugation of biomolecules, such as streptavidin and immunoglobulin G (IgG), show co-condensation with most semiconducting polymers for modification and functionalization of a nanoparticle surface.",

The process of CTC isolation is effectively executed through the utilization of both affinity-based and physical-based separation methods [26]. Although the process of isolating CTCs has seen improvements, physical-based approaches continue to face challenges due to the diverse nature of tumor cells and the presence of white blood cell contamination. As a result, the effectiveness and purity of these methods remain low. Conversely, the main drawback of using an affinitybased method is that there may be varying levels of cell surface marker expression (such as EpCAM) on CTCs due to factors such as the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) [27]. As a result, the two approaches mentioned earlier have the potential to decrease the number of valuable CTCs significantly. As per earlier research, using nanostructured surfaces has proven highly effective in detecting uncommon circulating tumor cells [28][29][30]. The method has a practical benefit in surpassing other CTC isolation techniques by not depending on the CTCs' physical dimensions or surface markers. Over 95% of CTCs can be identified using this method. \n\nPolymeric biomaterials are widely used in biomedical research due to their ease of manufacturing, flexibility, biocompatibility, and good mechanical, chemical, and thermal properties [32]. Polystyrene (PS), as a high-transparent and non-toxic polymer, is one of the most commonly-used biomaterials for cell culture applications [33].",

            "text": "Distinct from inorganic NPs like QDs and MNCs, SPNPs are mainly composed of optically active semiconducting polymers (SPs) and amphiphilic polymer matrixes (optional). Zhu et al. designed SPNPs with core SPs, middle silica layer, and outer PEG corona for enhancing the in vivo NIR fluorescence molecular imaging. Multilayered nanostructures not only allow the lymph nodes tracking but also allow for sensitive tumor imaging. [269,272] Chao et al. designed SPNPs via self-assembling from an amphiphilic semiconducting oligomer (ASO) for photoacoustic and fluorescence dual-modal imaging. The fluorescent intensity of tumor area increased gradually with time after tail vein injection of ASO, which suggests that ASO passively targeted to the tumor site by EPR effect. [270] he concept of biosensors was proposed in the 1960s, and comprehensively and deeply researched in the 1980s. [273] The nanofluorescent biosensor is a new analytical system that uses fluorescent nanomaterials as carriers with the fluorescent signal as the detection object. As we mentioned above, a wide variety of FNPs show the superior optical properties, such as bright fluorescence, high photostability, and excellent biocompatibility to be applied for the construction of fluorescent biosensor platforms. [15,274] For example, Shi et al. designed a nanomedicine, called \"sense-act-treat\" system, which combined a ratiometric pH sensor with therapeutic gold nanocage. This design could \"sense\" the tumor through two-state switching of fluorescence and further provide chemotherapy and hyperthermia for tumor treatment, showing the future potential application in cancer diagnosis and therapy. [275] Saranya et al. designed smart programmable nanoarchitectures based on AuNPs linking with Raman-active fluorophores through a peptide linker, Phe-Lys-Cys (FKC).",

            "text": "Polymers have also been investigated as electrodes for pathogen detection. Polymers have various advantages, including tunable electrical conductivity, biocompatiblity, and environmentally stability. Polymer electrodes are also compatible with a range of biorecognition element immobilization techniques (Arshak et al. 2009;Guimard et al. 2007). Polymers also exhibit mechanical properties that enable electrode-tissue mechanical matching, an important consideration in the design of implantable and wearable biosensors. Polymer electrodes can be broadly classified as (1) conjugated polymer or (2) polymer composite.\n\nPolyaniline and polypyrrole have been the most commonly used conjugated polymers for pathogen detection due to their high conductivity in the doped state . Moreover, polypyrrole has been shown to be biocompatible and exhibit affinity for methylated nucleic acids (Arshak et al. 2009). However, polyaniline films lose electrochemical activity in solutions of pH greater than 4, which presents a measurement challenge when considering samples of varying pH (Wan, 2008). Conjugated polymer electrodes commonly exhibit thin-film form factors and are deposited onto insulating substrates via layer-by-layer approaches, spin coating, or electrochemical polymerization (Xia et al. 2010). For example, Chowdhury et al. used a polyaniline electrode for detection of E. coli over a dynamic range of 10 2 to 10 7 CFU/mL (Chowdhury et al. 2012). Hai et al. and He et al. used organic transistors based on spin-coated poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) films for detection of human influenza A virus (H1N1) and E. coli, respectively (Hai et al. 2018;He et al. 2012).\n\nPolymer composite electrodes are often composed of a nonconducting polymer mixed with a conducting or semiconducting dispersed phase. Micro-particles and nanomaterials, such as graphite, Au nanoparticles (AuNPs), graphene, and carbon nanotubes (CNTs), have been commonly used as the dispersed phase (Dong et al. 2013;",

Another article by Gu et al. focuses on a particular type of NIR fluorophores, semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs). SPNs are constructed by encapsulating hydrophobic semiconducting polymers (SPs) with amphiphilic copolymers, and have shown great promise for phototheranostics of cancer. The authors review recent advances of thiadiazoloquinoxaline (TQ)-based SPNs from their synthesis and hydrophilic functionalization to NIR-II (1,000\u20131,700 nm) fluorescence imagingguided cancer photothermal therapy (PTT). To enhance the PTT efficiency, they also discuss methods for constructing SPNs with capability of multimodal imaging. Current limitations are summarized at the end that hamper clinical applications of the SPNs, such as relatively large size and low tumor targeting ability.

            "text": "Semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) are advanced organic materials that have been applied in many imaging modalities, including fluorescent imaging, US imaging, and PAI. The advantages of SPNs are numerous and include large absorption coefficient, tunable absorption, high photostability, low toxicity, 86 high structural flexibility, small size, and higher PA signal generation than single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and AuNRs. 210 As an imaging probe to localize specific diseases or tissues, SPNs can produce PA signals in the sites of interest, relying on simple accumulation via the retention effect or receptor binding on the cell surface. This strategy leads to the application of LN mapping, 210 in vivo tumor-targeted imaging, [211][212][213] cell tracking, 214 and ROS mapping. 134 For example, SPN with poly as cyclopentadithiophene-altbenzothiadiazole showed a maximum NIR-I absorption at 660 nm and maximum PA signals at 690 nm, and it was used as PAI probes for lymphatic imaging. 210 Another recently reported SPNs, which was fabricated into water-dispersed NPs, showed strong absorption in the NIR-II window and efficient cellular uptake, leading to effective accumulation in subcutaneous tumors and brain tumors. 212 ther than the simple accumulation of agents, SPNs also can be employed as activable PA probes with biomarker-triggered signals, which offer measurable and quantifiable real-time information on pathological status at the molecular level. Such smart PA probes have been used for in vivo imaging of a variety of biomarkers and biological metabolites in recent years, including abnormal pH, 215 different ROS imaging (such as ONOO \u2212 and CLO \u2212 level, 134,210 O2 \u2022\u2212 level 216 ), and granzyme B. 104 The reader can refer to Ref. 104 for more details on activatable SP nanoprobe (SPNP), which was reported as a biomarker to detect granzyme B in the tumors of living mice. Granzyme B can be considered to be a signature of immune activation due to elevated concentration in cytotoxic T lymphocytes.",

In addition to their exceptional photostability and biocompatibility, semiconducting polymers possess distinct advantages over the other nanoparticles in PA applications [90]. Successful detection of reactive oxygen species (ROS) using polymeric nanoparticles as nanoprobes has demonstrated that, these nanoparticles can be an excellent tool for the diagnosis of disease conditions such as tumor metastasis, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, obesity and etc., that involves ROS guided/influenced pathophysiological events [87]. Similarly, quantum dots represents another group of multifunctional nanoparticles with significant potential in photothermal therapy (PTT) and has made them a promising candidate to be a PA contrast agent [90]. Perfluorocarbon (PFC) are microbubble contrast agents, that showed great potential in ultrasound/PA based therapies and stimuli responsive drug delivery, when they were coupled with plasmonic nanoparticles [96]. Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) based polymeric nanoparticles and their derivatives were aided in tumor imaging with more than fivefold of the background signal at 2 h of the nanoparticle injection [87,97]. Benzothiadiazole moiety amplified the PA signal provided by the nanoparticles by twofolds [98]. Apart from imaging application for diagnosis, PA image guided photothermal/photodynamic therapy (PTT/PDT) was also achieved using semiconducting polymeric nanoparticles (Fig. 4) [97,99].",

            "text": "Promising developments in the material sciences have demonstrated the technical feasibility of electrically conducting polymers. Depending on their chemical structure, synthetic materials may possess electrically conducting, semiconducting or isolating properties. It was through the use of these materials for electronic applications that the term \"polymer electronics\" was coined. Whereas electronic components made of plastic would have been inconceivable only recently, they are now well on the way towards becoming reality. \n\nConductive polymers are usually produced by adding small quantities of oxidizing agents such as chlorine, bromine, iodine or arsenic pentafluoride to create the polymer matrix. In the process, they acquire electrical conducting abilities comparable to those of metallic conductors [81], [82]. The first applications considered for conductive polymers included batteries and accumulators. Other semiconducting polymers are used primarily in the field of optoelectronics and in photonic components [83]. The use of such materials in medical engineering is, however, problematic in terms of how biocompatible these substances are at present. Conjugated polymers in a conductive state are, almost without exception, insoluble, infusible and not very elastic. The metal-like ability to conduct is inextricably bound up with the solid state and a crystalline arrangement. One means of producing modifiable electrically conducting polymers involves the copolymerization of electrically conducting substances with conventional polymers, such as polyacetylene in polyethylene, polystyrol or polypyrrol [84], [85]. \n\nThe potential benefits of using modified polymers as electrode materials consist in the improved mechanical properties of the electrode array and in the scope for placing a considerably higher number of electrode contacts on the electrode array. This approach could lead to the electrode having considerably enhanced overall flexibility and thus to further optimization of electrodes that have the potential to help preserve hearing. However, polymer-based implants must, in terms of their long-term stability and electrical transmission properties, be held up as the benchmark for conventional implant materials, so that immediate clinical application is not yet expected at the present time.",

Due to this limitation, Cerenkov luminescence (CL) from radionuclides has recently been proposed as an alternative light source in a strategy referred to as Cerenkov radiation\u2010induced therapy (CRIT). Semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) have ideal optical properties, such as large absorption cross\u2010sections and broad absorbance, which can be utilized to harness the relatively weak CL produced by radionuclides. SPNs can be doped with photosensitizers and have \u2248100% energy transfer efficiency by multiple energy transfer mechanisms. Herein, an optimized photosensitizer\u2010doped SPN is investigated as a nanosystem to harness and amplify CL for cancer theranostics. It is found that semiconducting polymers significantly amplify CL energy transfer efficiency. Bimodal positron emission tomography (PET) and optical imaging studies show high tumor uptake and retention of the optimized SPNs when administered intravenously or intratumorally. Lastly, it is found that photosensitizer\u2010doped SPNs have excellent potential as a cancer theranostics nanosystem in an in vivo tumor therapy study. This study shows that SPNs are ideally suited to harness and amplify CL for cancer theranostics, which may provide a significant advancement for CRIT that are unabated by tissue penetration limits.",

In particular, carbon nanotubes have shown excellent applicability in the detection of biological molecules, as biosensors, with a number of designs capable of detecting molecules such as proteins in in vitro and in vivo environments outside of ovarian cancer [82,89]. Specific to ovarian cancer, however, implantable membranes containing anti-HE4 carbon nanotube complexes developed by Williams et al. were shown to function as a variable wavelength probe for HE4 detection (Figure 4) [83]. These nanotubes generate a detectable blueshift in the emission readout after binding of HE4 antigens in in vitro HGSOC fluids (Figure 4b) and distinguished HE4 upregulating from HE4 negative tumors in an orthotopic xenograft model (Figure 4c), where membrane encapsulated nanotubes were implanted across the peritoneal. The presence of HE4 caused a measurable emission blueshift of up to 1 nm, with a detection limit of 10 nM. These implanted sensors were also shown to be effective up to 38 days after initial implantation, and other studies found no significant signs of toxicity on similar carbon nanotubes at periods of up to 4 months, suggesting potential long-term stability of these materials in murine models [90]. Nanotubes of similar design have more recently been used for the probing of a variety of disease-related biomolecules such as DNA [91], RNA [92], protease [93] and proteins [94]. The development of carbon nanotube probes may allow for readily available monitoring of specific biomarkers, which may prove invaluable for detecting ovarian cancer earlier in high-risk groups and in instances of reoccurrence. However, carbon nanotubes are currently limited to in vitro applications, including as sensors, as the field overcomes concerns about toxicity and safety [95,96]. \n\nBiomedicines 2021, 9, x FOR PEER REVIEW 10 of 26 groups and in instances of reoccurrence.",

Over the past several years, PCs have been broadly used in many applications, including sensing (Barry & Wiltzius, 2006;Potyrailo et al., 2007;Huang et al., 2013;Zhang et al., 2015b;Li et al., 2016b), biodetection (Wang et al., 2013;Cai et al., 2014, Massad-Ivanir et al., 2014;Ye et al., 2014;Ayyub & Kofinas, 2015;Cai et al., 2015a,b), displays (Arsenault et al., 2007;Kang et al., 2011;Su et al., 2014), optical devices (Li et al., 2010;Scofield et al., 2011;Li & Meng, 2014;Wan et al., 2016;Aly et al., 2017;Liberal & Engheta, 2017), superconductor (Zhang et al., 2012;Aly et al., 2015;Aly et al., 2016) and solar cells (Agust\u0131 \u00b4n et al., 2011;Bayram & Halaoui, 2013;Park et al., 2014). \n\nIn recent years, PC materials have attracted more and more attention in the area of biochemistry and biomedicine because of their high sensitivity, selectivity and ability for real-time monitoring (Cunningham & Laing, 2006;Fan et al., 2008). Many new techniques have been developed based on PC materials that have shown obvious advantages in drug delivery, biomolecular detection and tumor screening. This paper reviews the application of PCs in drug delivery, biomedicine and biosensing.",

            "text": "The prognosis and effectiveness of treatment for many cancer types, as well as the monitoring targets for adjuvant cancer treatment, currently depend on specific tumor markers. 20 Biosensors offer several advantages over other available analytical techniques, including being manageable, cost-effective, simple to use, selective, sensitive, and less time-consuming. 21 The components of biosensors include an analyte, a bioreceptor, a transducer, electronics, and a display. 22 The bioreceptor provides specificity for analyte detection when immobilized onto the surface of the detection component. 23 When these bioreceptors interact with the target analyte, they produce physicochemical changes that the transducer can convert into measurable signals that can be detected and quantified. 24 \u221228 The sensing properties of biosensors (e.g., linear detection range, LOD, sensitivity, and stability) depend on the material employed to immobilize the bioreceptors. 29 Biosensors can be classified according to transducers into various types including electrochemical, piezoelectric, optical, mechanical, and thermal sensors. Each type of biosensor utilizes a different mechanism to convert the recognition event into a measurable signal, allowing for the detection and quantification of analytes in diverse samples, 30 as depicted in Figure 2. \n\nPolymer-based sensors have made significant strides in achieving higher tissue compatibility and biosafety when used as implantable electronic sensors in vivo. In 1970, a groundbreaking innovation emerged in the field of medical monitoring. A balloon-based pressure sensor was successfully implanted into the heart to monitor left ventricular pressure. 31 his remarkable development showcased the exceptional qualities of polymers, which include high flexibility, 32 selfrepairability, 33 stretchability, 34 and biodegradation. 35 These extraordinary characteristics have opened new frontiers in medical technology and paved the way for future advancements in the field. By combining device engineering and functional integration, these sensors have been able to detect multiple stimuli with an even greater accuracy. These advancements offer new possibilities for improving health outcomes and enhancing our understanding of the human body. 36 Extensive reviews have described the types of biosensors and the different detection methods utilized. 37",

Tang et al. developed a nanocarrier based on the photoreactive oxetane groups modified semiconducting polymer to dope with Chlorin e6 (Ce6), which was called Ce6-doped semiconducting polymer dots (Ce6-Pdots). After UV photo-crosslinking, a polymeric network was formed due to the reactions between the modified side chains to prevent the retained Ce6 leakage. Because the emission range of the nanocarrier overlaps with the Ce6 absorption range, upon green light (520 nm) irradiation, the semiconducting polymer can transfer the excitation energy to the Ce6 and then efficient 1 O 2 were generated. Compared with Ce6 alone, the energy transfer process can avoid the relatively high dose of light irradiation and due to the large absorption cross section of the semiconducting polymer-based nanocarrier, the 1 O 2 generation was amplified, which resulted in highly effective in vitro PDT effect even with low NPs concentration (10 \u03bcg/mL) and light dose (60 J/cm 2 ) and the in vivo tumor growth was apparently inhibited after the PDT treatment [140]. NPs can also protect PSs from inactivation and degradation in the complex biological environment. For example, ICG, which is a PSs approved by U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for clinical treatment and imaging, still suffers from the instability in aqueous solution, which hinder its PDT efficacy. To improve its therapeutic effect, Yang et al. fabricated ICG-oxygen nanobubbles (named as ICG-NBs-O 2 ) through assembling the free ICG molecules with NBs-O 2 . The NPs assembly occurred on the gas-liquid interface due to the hydrophilic-hydrophobic interaction.",

            "text": "Cancer is a highly heterogeneous and adaptable disease that is known for its high mortality rates and the recurrence after treatment (Craene and Berx, 2013). According to the 2012 Report to the Nation on the status of cancer, approximately 2% of the total U.S. population dies with cancer each year (Eheman et al., 2012). Cancer poses an even more serious threat in the fast developing countries. It is now the leading cause of death in urban China (Zhao et al., 2010). \n\nEarly detection of cancer is one of the most hopeful approaches to reduce cancer death rates. Table 1 shows the survival rates for people with lung, colorectal, breast and prostate cancers diagnosed at the late stage (i.e., cancer with metastasis to distant tissues) vs. at an early stage. From this table, we can clearly perceive that the survival is significantly improved when earlystage cancer can be diagnosed and then treated with existing therapies. Traditional screening methods for early diagnosis, such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), are often costly and not available for many people. Cancer biomarkers are molecules that can indicate the biological states of the disease, which increase in concentration during the onset of the disease (Phan et al., 2009). Sensitive and accurate detection of cancer biomarkers in human fluid samples could offer seminal contributions to early diagnosis. Therefore, the development of novel technologies that are capable of sensitively and selectively detect cancer biomarkers is crucially important. \n\nNanotechnology pertains to nanostructured materials or materials with nanostructured components that usually possess physical and chemical properties different from their bulk counterparts (Bonnell, 2010;Weiss, 2010). One intriguing benefit of nanotechnology involved in cancer diagnostics is the development of nanostructured materials-based detection systems can be applied to detect cancer biomarkers with an extremely high sensitivity and an ultralow Detection Limit (DL) (Heath and Davis, 2008;Nie et al., 2007).",

Additionally, in biosensing they provide increased signal of detection in the presence of an analyte compared to depletion mode OECTs.\n\nSemiconducting polymers swell in typical organic solvents allowing ion penetration and high transconductance. 17 However, for biosensing applications it is essential to operate in aqueous environments. 15,24 Due to the non-polar nature of polymers, this limits their ability to swell and thus limits performance in aqueous media. A biphasic electrolyte platform developed by Duong et al. incorporates two immiscible electrolytes, an organic layer in direct contact with the polymer and aqueous layer on top. 25 The former is selected because it allows ion penetration into P3HT so it can operate as an OECT, whilst the less dense aqueous layer interfaces with the biological environment of interest. This development opens the potential to utilise a wide range of organic semiconducting polymers that have been previously developed over the past few decades for transistor and solar cell applications.\n\nIn order to implement organic semiconducting polymers in OECTs for biosensing applications, particularly with live cells or cell membranes, it is essential to operate the device at lower voltages (o1 V) in order not to adversely affect the functionality and structure of the biological systems. [26][27][28] Low-voltage operation is also of key interest particularly important for use with low supply voltage thin-film batteries and portable devices. 29 The operation voltage of the device utilising p-type doping/ dedoping processes is partially governed by the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of the polymer. 25 Many polymers with deep HOMO levels are not compatible for biosensing applications (as the operation voltage would be too high when typical metal electrodes such as Au or Ag are used) despite showing promising electronic properties and high charge",

            "text": "In one study, an antifouling electrochemical biosensor based on the conducting polymer poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and a multifunctional peptide was manufactured for CTCs in blood [56]. The designed peptide with antifouling and targeting breast cancer cells capabilities, in addition to the electrodeposited PEDOT, could enhance electron transfer on the detection surface and amplify the signal-to-noise ratio, resulting in an increased sensitivity of the biosensor. \n\nWhile electrochemical sensors have been utilized to detect DNA, proteins, and small molecules, they are still gaining traction for detecting CTCs or exosomes. There are several reviews available on the use of electrochemical sensors for the detection of various molecules [57][58][59][60] Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) imaging is one of the methods where the implication of nanoparticles (NPs) could significantly enhance its performance. The NP-enhanced SPR imaging can effectively sense tumor DNA in the patient's plasma. Bellassai et al. created a dual-functional, low-fouling, and densely packed poly-L-lysine surface layer that prevents non-specific adsorption of blood molecules on the sensor surface [61]. The attachment of peptide nucleic acid probes to this multifunctional polymer layer can complete the circulating DNA sequence, thus facilitating the capture of the analyte from cancer patients. This approach can potentially provide a more accurate and efficient method for detecting tumor DNA in a patient's plasma. \n\nTo investigate the potential of polymer dots in the detection of cancer cells, Liu et al. created a sensor for breast cancer diagnosis based on carbon polymer dots (CPDs) in peripheral blood cells [2]. Three polymer structures, including m-Phenylenediamine (mPD), o-phenylenediamine (oPD), and p-phenylenediamine (pPD), were selected for fluorescent synthesis of CPDs and detection of tumor-bearing mice. These CPDs have different surface chemistries, luminescence properties, and functional groups that can be accumulated on the surface of peripheral blood immunocytes.",

These data indicate cancer to be one of the diseases with the highest rate of morbidity and mortality nowadays. Finding effective methodologies for early detection, diagnosis and treatment has become a fundamental objective when developing NPs as DDSs [67][68][69]. Ordinary imaging and diagnosis techniques can only detect tumor mass when it is at least one-centimeter in size, being notably difficult to detect cancer at early stages [70]. This is the reason many researchers are currently trying to develop new and smaller composites able to identify malignant cells related to cancer processes, in order to inform medical staff to devise a treatment strategy. Polymeric NPs have thus emerged as an alternative to limit ordinary contrast agents due to their surface modification abilities and their capacity to regulate solubility of the embedded agents in order to enhance imaging of cancerous cells. Some of the following recent investigations that have been consulted involve both therapeutic and diagnostic objectives (known as \"theranostic agents\"). This section of the review focuses on diagnostic and imaging results and just mentions some of the therapeutic facets.",

            "text": "Cancer-related diseases are a major global health concern due to escalating mortality rates and limited treatment options. Early cancer detection and diagnosis are crucial for improving patient outcomes (1). Current diagnostic techniques, such as tissue biopsies, imaging techniques, and tumor markers, are inadequate for capturing all aspects of a patient's cancer due to their inability to meet diagnostic criteria, sampling biases, and limited access to metastatic lesions. Histopathology is considered the most reliable method, but advanced imaging technologies like MRI and PET-CT can detect primary tumors and metastases. Liquid biopsy tests, which measure tumor components, have emerged as a recognized technique for molecular screening and early detection of cancers (Figure 1A) (2). \n\nCirculating tumor cells (CTCs) are cancer cells that spread from the main tumor and survive in the bloodstream, forming new tumors. They undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) to invade surrounding tissue. However, the efficiency of this process is limited, and not all CTCs in the vascular system can form metastases (Figure 1B) (3). The presence of CTCs in the bloodstream could serve as an early sign of cancer metastasis, allowing non-invasive monitoring and early identification of aggressive forms of cancer. This could contribute to the diagnosis and management of cancer. Over the past decade, research has improved techniques for detecting, separating, isolating, and analyzing colorectal cancer cells using micro-fluidic systems and genomic analysis (Figure 1C). CTCs have demonstrated prognostic efficacy in predicting progression-free and overall survival in patients with metastatic prostate, breast, and colorectal cancer (4,5). However, their scarcity makes it difficult to integrate them into routine clinical procedures. Advancements in precision medicine have prompted a thorough examination of CTCs. \n\nDespite significant advancements in nanoengineering and biomaterial modification on nanoparticle (NP) surfaces, unforeseen material features can have adverse effects on the functionality of NPs in physiologically relevant systems (6,7).",

In addition, it was confirmed that there is almost no cytotoxicity up to the 130 \u00b5M concentration of NAB NPs. \n\nLyu et al. performed both PA imaging and PTT using semiconducting polymer NPs (SPNs) [97]. First, SPNs was fabricated using by two biodegradable semiconducting polymers, poly{2,2 -[(2,5-bis(2-hexyldecyl)-3,6-dioxo-2,3,5,6-tetrahydropyrrolo [3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-diyl)-dithiophene]-5,5 -diyl-alt-vinylene} (DPPV) and poly{2,2 -[(2,5-bis(2-hexyldecyl)-3,6-dioxo-2,3,5,6-tetrahydropyrrolo [3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-diyl)-dithiophene]-5,5 -diyl-alt-thioph ene-2,5-diyl} (DPPT). To render them water-soluble, they were conjugated using PLGA-PEG and a self-assembly method to produce SPNV and SPNT, respectively. The size of these particles was ~36 nm, and both particles had broad absorption peaks ranging from 600 to 900 nm (Figure 5f). SPNV had the highest absorption peak at 819 nm, while that for SPNT was at 828 nm. It was found that the intensity of PA and PT imaging was strong only for SPNV (Figure 5h,i). In addition, following irradiation, SPNV had significant therapeutic efficacy in decreasing the volume of a tumor (Figure 5g). Finally, there is no cytotoxicity up to 150 \u00b5g/mL for SPNV and SPNT.",

            "text": "Nowadays, bioelectronic devices can be chiefly utilized in copious healthcarerelated applications, such as implants, sensors, and neural interfacing electrodes, to name but a few. 18\u221221 These principal applications of organic bioelectronic devices are presented in (Figure 1). While developing new materials and device configurations for bioelectronics, it is worth remembering that the interaction of a bioelectronic tool with a living host can occur in several different ways upon implantation. First, the material can be inadvertently toxic, and the insertion can lead to adverse effects on the surrounding tissue causing inflammation, response of the immune system, or even cell/organ death. Second, the material might not interact with the living host, in other words, be bioinert. Third, the bioelectronic device can form a close relationship with the tissue of the host if the material is active biologically and innocuous. Finally, a biomaterial can be bioresorbable and dissolve in the host tissue, allowing only temporary device operation. 20,26 Additionally, organic semiconductors (OSC), widely utilized in bioelectronics, possess the merit of mechanical flexibility, as well as having easily modifiable surface structure. Being soft solids, organic semiconducting polymers possess low values of Young's modulus, 20 kPa to 3 GPa, which is comparable to the parameters of the living tissue (\u223c10 kPa) in contrast to the values of inorganic semiconductors (\u223c100 GPa). 26\u221228 Notably, inflammation reduction can be achieved through strain alleviation at the tissue/implant interface as a result of organic semiconductor softness. 29 As such, utilizing soft biopolymers also allows for potential biocompatibility and engineered multifunctionality. 30 Compliant materials can be better suited for biological systems because the interface between biological tissue and electronic devices can be improved while avoiding detrimental effects. 31 These attractive features can be offered by conjugated polymers with their mechanical properties well-matched to the softness of biological systems. These properties, in turn, allow for the development of close bioelectronic relationships both at the macro-and nanoscale, allowing for proliferation and adhesion of cells, as well as polymer integration into the membrane of a cell. 2,",

Nevertheless, their widespread and efficient use is constrained by issues such as non-biodegradability, concerns about long-term in vivo toxicity, and uneven distribution of conducting particles in composite systems. \n\nConducting polymers are a unique class of organic compounds that offer advantages such as ease of synthesis, processing flexibility, and electrical and optical properties similar to those of metals and inorganic semiconducting materials (Bredas and Street, 1985, MacDiarmid et al., 1987, MacDiarmid, 2001, Ouyang et al., 2018, Checkol et al., 2018). Unlike traditional inorganic and metallic electronic materials, conductive polymers such as polyaniline, polypyrrole, and polythiophene provide enhanced mechanical strength and structural adaptability, making them more compatible with tissues and cells. These polymers, along with their derivatives and composites, are promising biomaterials due to their biocompatibility, ease of synthesis, modifiability, and ability to electrically regulate physicochemical properties through surface functionalization and the use of various dopant molecules (Ravichandran et al., 2010;Guimard et al., 2007). \n\nThese advantageous properties have led to their increasing application in biological fields such as drug delivery, biosensors, and tissue engineering (Hardy et al., 2013;Thompson et al., 2010).",

            "text": "Commercially available contrast-enhanced MR imaging in tumor resection is disappointing in different aspects, such as short circulation time, poor BBB penetration and toxicity. Polymers have always been in demand for their biodegradation and biocompatibility profiles. Polymers are being utilized to improve MR imaging in gliomas, designed on the concept of nanotechnology. One recent study explored the potential of red fluorescent carbonized polymer dots with high internalization in glioma cells along with low toxicity, high photostability and long emission/excitation wavelengths. Such nanoprobes help in real-time image-guided surgery efficiently [186]. Similarly, biocompatible and photostable polymeric NPs decorated with cyclo (Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Phe-Lys (mpa)), to actively target integrin on the tumor cells, were designed, with an ability to absorb near-infrared beams for precise PA imaging and spatiotemporal photothermal therapy. The polymeric NPs pictured glioma at 3-mm depth with a high signal to noise ratio. Hence, polymeric NPs were found to be promising in glioma cell imaging by the PA technique [187]. Semiconducting polymers were developed by the fluorination strategy to yield fluorescence in the precise diagnosis of brain tumor. The bright near-infrared-designed polymer dots yielded three-fold enhanced images compared to non-fluorinated counterparts [188]. False-positive and ambiguous images remain the problem with existing imaging techniques. Hence, a robust strategy was exploited to design a polymeric nanostructure attached to an image contrast agent with an intrinsic T 1 /T 2 dual-mode characteristic. Nanostructure coordination polymers demonstrated low toxicity, high stability and dual T 1 /T 2 contrast ability in the murine glioblastoma model when linked to paramagnetic iron moiety. Furthermore, the bio distribution of the polymeric contrast nanostructure was persistent and gave sharp images with dial mode [189].",

            "text": "In addition, BLZ-100 was translated into the clinic and it is currently undergoing evaluation in Phase I clinical trials in adult patients with glioma (NCT02234297). Furthermore, this probe has been clinically evaluated for adult skin cancer (NCT02097875), sarcoma (NCT024643320), and for pediatric patients with central nervous system tumors (NCT02462629) [73]. \n\nOther promising fluorescence-based imaging probes developed for tumors detection are quantum dots (QDs). QDs can provide images across large ranges of wavelengths and have high quantum yields [74]. Unlike organic dyes, which often suffer rapid photo-bleaching [75,76], QDs are composed of semiconducting metals (e.g., Cd, Zn, Se, In, P, and As) that are resistant to photo-bleaching [77]. \n\nFurthermore, the quantum properties of QDs are tunable and can provide excitation/emission wavelengths ranging from ultraviolet (UV) to NIR. The outer shell of the QD could be modified by organic layers including PEG polymers, phospholipids, and peptides [78], thus preventing nonspecific absorption of proteins to their surface, increase blood half-life, and reducing toxicity [79,80]. CTX conjugated with cadmium-free silver-indium-sulfide (Ag-In-S or AIS) chalcopyrite QDs was used in cellular imaging studies [47]. This CTX-conjugated QD-micelles exhibited specific internalization into U-87 brain tumor cells. Although QDs offer potentially valuable benefits in preclinical oncology, such as drug targeting and in vivo biomedical imaging, under certain conditions, they pose risks to human health and the environment, constituting a barrier for their translation to clinical use [81]. Semiconducting polymer dots have aroused extensive interests as a novel family of fluorescent probes for tumor targeting applications [54,61]. Unlike QDs, polymer-based dots were developed from biologically non-toxic materials, using deep-red photo-acceptors and visible-light photo-donors.",

            "text": "Conjugated polymers, a new type of optical material, have become a research hotspot because of their excellent optical properties and biocompatibility [178][179][180][181][182][183]. However, most of the conjugated polymers are hydrophobic and with sizes ranging from 50 nm to several microns. Hence, most conjugated polymers cannot be cleared through the kidney system, leading to accumulation in the spleen or liver [184]. If MPS cannot degrade these hydrophobic polymers, they will accumulate in organs for months to years and may cause long-time unforeseen biotoxicity [185]. \n\nFor instance, Cheng group has developed a semiconducting polymer (named PDFT1032) based on furan-containing diketopyrrolopyrrole polymers (PDFT) with NIR-II emission peak at 1032 nm (Figure 11A) [127]. Moreover, PDFT1032 has been applied in several important bioimaging scenarios, including tumor imaging for evaluating vascular embolotherapy on a subcutaneous osteosarcoma model, image-guided orthotopic tumor surgery, and sentinel lymph node biopsy. PDFT1032 is a potential NIR-II probe (HD: 68 nm) with high photostability and low toxicity in vivo. After 24 hours of intravenous injection of PDFT1032 into the mice, the dynamic imaging and biological distribution studies revealed that the nanoprobes were rapidly cleared by renal and hepatobiliary systems, contributing to obtaining a good NIR-II tumor imaging capability (Figure 11B), making it possible for NIR-II image-guided surgery. Similarly, Fan group has designed a conjugated polymer TTQ-2TC with optimized absorption in the NIR-II window (Figure 11C) [128]. With the alkyl-side-chain-modified bithiophene (2TC) as the donor unit, excellent solubility in organic solvents and obvious NIR-II signals were obtained.",

            "text": "Cancer theranostics which integrates cancer imaging and therapy into one system provides the opportunity of continuous monitoring of therapeutic efficiency, thus allowing clinicians to design personalized medicine for each patient. 1,2 Among numerous imaging modalities, optical imaging which utilizes light as an excitation or signal source has gained more and more attention because of its advantages such as low toxicity, high sensitivity, low cost and minimal detection time. [3][4][5][6][7] Besides optical imaging, light can also trigger phototherapy including photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT), which are both promising therapeutic methods with the advantages of precise treatment and minimized side effects. [8][9][10][11] Thus, phototheranostics which combines optical imaging and phototherapy is a promising theranostic modality. [12][13][14] Until now, many materials have been developed as phototheranostic agents including near-infrared (NIR) dyes, [15][16][17][18][19] inorganic nanoparticles, 20,21 carbon and two-dimensional materials. [22][23][24] However, all of them have their own disadvantages such as poor photostability and low absorption coefficients. [25][26][27] Therefore, developing new optical agents with improved properties for phototheranostics is highly demanded.\n\nSemiconducting polymers (SPs) are macromolecules with pconjugated backbones, which have been widely applied in the \ue103elds of electronic devices and sensors because of their unique optical properties. 28 Recently, semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) derived from SPs have been applied in optical imaging owing to their high absorption coefficient, good photostability and biocompatibility. [29][30][31] In detail, SPNs can be applied in \ue104uorescence imaging including tumor imaging and cell tracking. [32][33][34][35] NIR-absorbing SPNs can be applied in photoacoustic (PA) imaging of stem cells, 36 vasculature, [37][38][39] tumor, [40][41]",

            "text": "and noninvasiveness compared with traditional chemotherapies and radiotherapies [18,19]. The so-called phototheranostics which combines phototherapies and optical imaging not only permits precise administration of phototherapies under imaging guidance, but also realizes real-time therapeutic effects monitoring, thus reduces side effects and prevents recurrence. Therefore, development of biomaterials for NIR-II fluorescence/ PA imaging-based phototheranostic systems is highly demanded. \n\nTo date, however, the uptake of biomaterials into tumor tissues and cells is mostly the controversial enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) [20][21][22]. It has been recommended that active transcytosis techniques be developed for delivery efficiency enhancement [21,23], including utilization of tumorpenetrating peptides [24] and design of polymer conjugates [25]. Providing with high binding affinity and specificity to certain extracellular ligands, targeting peptides possess advantages including convenient synthesis and easy chemical modification, good histocompatibility, low immunogenicity, favorable pharmacokinetics, and acceptable in vivo stability and integrity [26,27], and have emerged as an alternative to molecular targeting ligands [28]. Among these, peptide PT (PPSHTPT) has been constructed to mimic natural protein osteocalcin property in vivo and has shown its targeted binding to osteosarcoma in vitro and in vivo [29][30][31]. \n\nHerein, we report an oligopeptide PT based semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPN-PT), which shows OS targeting ability, for NIR-II fluorescence and NIR-I PA dual-modal imaging guided PTT and PDT therapies. Semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) represent an emerging class of organic photonic agents fabricated by optically active semiconducting polymers [32], which have been tremendously explored for the applications such as fluorescence imaging [33], PA imaging [34], PTT [35] and PDT [36].",

EL-Sherbiny et al. aimed at constructing the potent anticancer NC composed of chitosan nanoparticles, curcumin and eugenol and evaluating its anticancer activity in depth against colorectal adenocarcinoma and breast adenocarcinoma cells. These findings suggest the usefulness and effectiveness of NCs composed of multinatural molecules. \n\nThe specific recognition, low immunogenicity, and low cytotoxicity of aptamers make them themselves well suited for the diagnosis and treatment of tumors (Wang et al., 2022). Particularly, the active targeting of aptamers can more accurately select target cells to assist in the controlled and continuous transfer of therapeutic molecules [drugs (Go et al., 2021) and peptides (Kim et al., 2015)] using AuNPs and improve the uptake of therapeutic molecules by the cells. A review by Deng et al. investigates the progress in the application of aptamer-modified AuNPs in cancer marker detection and targeted therapy. Further, the authors also analyze the prospects and challenges associated with the advancement of AuNPs from the current basic research to clinical experiment. \n\nProstate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) has been considered as a potential target for prostate cancer targeted diagnosis and therapy (Sun et al., 2021). Benefiting from the rapid development of nanobiotechnology, Xiao et al. constructs a tumor-targeted nanosystem with PA imaging and photothermal capabilities to co-deliver photosensitizer IR780 and paclitaxel for tumor therapy through surface modification, which uses perfluorocarbon as the core, polylactic acid-glycolic acid (PLGA) as the shell, PSMA as targeting molecules.",

            "text": "The infectious diseases resulting from pathogenic microbes are highly contagious and the source of infection is difficult to control, which seriously endangers life and public health safety. Although the emergence of antibiotics has a good therapeutic effect in the early stage, the massive abuse of antibiotics has brought about the evolution of pathogens with drug resistance, which has gradually weakened the lethality and availability of antibiotics. Cancer is a more serious disease than pathogenic bacteria infection, which also threatens human life and health. Traditional treatment methods have limitations such as easy recurrence, poor prognosis, many side effects, and high toxicity. These two issues have led to the exploration and development of novel therapeutic agents (such as conjugated polymers) and therapeutic strategies (such as phototherapy) to avoid the increase of drug resistance and toxic side effects. As a class of organic polymer biological functional materials with excellent photoelectric properties, Conjugated polymers (CPs) have been extensively investigated in biomedical fields, such as the detection and treatment of pathogens and tumors due to their advantages of easy modification and functionalization, good biocompatibility and low cost. A rare comprehensive overview of CPs-based detection and treatment applications has been reported. This paper reviews the design strategies and research status of CPs used in biomedicine in recent years, introduces and discusses the latest progress of their application in the detection and treatment of pathogenic microorganisms and tumors according to different detection or treatment methods, as well as the limitations and potential challenges in prospective exploration.",

            "text": "In contrast to the wide technological use of conducting polymers in electronic and optoelectronic devices, their application in biomedicine (particularly in vivo) has been limited due to dopant leaching and attendant conductivity issues at physiological pH. It is only fairly recently that conducting polymers have made a genuine transition into biomedicine as semiconducting polymer dots (Pdots), where the strong fluorescence exhibited in their undoped electrically insulating state is used to advantage [1][2][3][4]. A combination of high intrinsic absorptivity of conjugated polymers and densely packed nanoscale morphology confers Pdots with high chromophore density and very high brightness [5]. Their allorganic nature also often leads to biocompatibility and low toxicity [6]. \n\nIn this study, we show that semiconducting parent polythiophene Pdots are readily synthesized and can be used as versatile bioimaging agents. Unlike ring-substituted polythiophene, the parent system stands somewhat alone among conducting polymers where its insolubility, intractability, and infusibility severely limits its use [7]. We have described a workaround where thin films of nanofibrillar doped parent polythiophene deposit directly on inert substrates during a chemical oxidative polymerization of thiophene by in situ adsorption polymerization, thereby bypassing all postsynthesis processing steps [8]. We now show that the doped polythiophene powder obtained during the synthesis, when treated with hydrazine hydrate, yields undoped ring-functionalized (Cl, OH) polythiophene powder that disperses in a variety of organic solvents as 10-25 nm diameter Pdots that are highly fluorescent.",

Novel biomarkers for early detection of TNBC and CRC have been proposed throughout the years, although the rate of success remains limited.

            "text": "Conjugated polymers are well-known for their fantastic photoelectric properties due to the existence of large \u03c0conjugated backbones. For a long time in the past, conjugated polymers were extensively studied in the areas like organic semiconductors and solar cells, but not biomedicine. It was not until the year of 2011-2012 that two kinds of very commonly used conjugated polymers, polyaniline (PANI) and polypyrrole (PPy), were successfully developed as photothermal agents for the first time (Yang et al., 2011(Yang et al., , 2012b)). Later on, lots of semiconducting polymers were further explored for fluorescent imaging and phototherapy (Li J. C. et al., 2018;Zhu et al., 2018). Benefiting from the unique chemical structures, conjugated polymers hold the advantages of excellent photostability and high photothermal conversion efficiency. Several excellent reviews have summarized the applications of conjugated polymers in fluorescent imaging and phototherapy (Xu et al., 2014;Qian et al., 2017;Li J. C. et al., 2018;Sun et al., 2018). Conjugated polymers are generally hydrophobic organic molecules, therefore, nano-stabilizing methods like encapsulation in amphiphiles or covalent grafting of hydrophilic polymers are usually necessary prior to their use vitro and in vivo. By further incorporation of chemical drugs, conjugated polymers based nanomaterials can be utilized for combined chemo-photothermal therapy. \n\nPANI nanoparticles were firstly reported to serve as a photothermal agent for in vitro treatment of epithelial cancer in 2011 (Yang et al., 2011). Li et al. further prepared F127 stabilized PANI nanoparticles for in vivo tumor ablation with no tumor regrowth observed (Zhou et al., 2013). Chemotherapeutic drugs were encapsulated within PANI nanoparticles to perform the combination of chemo-and photothermal therapy.",

These devices can now detect diverse biomaterial-related signals with heightened precision [151]. Monitoring biomaterials involved in PDT provides valuable insights into the process, status, and efficacy of PDT, leading to enhanced effectiveness and the ability to overcome resistance. \n\nOne versatile application of NGs is their use as physical and chemical sensors. Wearable sensors, powered by NGs, gauge biochemical parameters in bodily fluids, illuminating the photodynamic process and alleviating treatment resistance [37,152,153]. NGs such as TENGs provide high energy conversion efficiency, resilience in demanding environments, and stable adjustable outputs, rendering them ideal power sources for biomedical detection of analytes like dopamine, glucose, lactate, enzymes, various microbes, as well as chemical substances. \n\nPeng et al. developed a flexible self-powered metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) photoswitch for UV light detection, featuring a flexible gallium nitride (GaN) membrane on a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate [37]. The asymmetric MSM design effectively separated electron-hole pairs via the intrinsic electric field, eliminating the need for external power sources. This GaN-based photoswitch exhibited superior UV photoresponse, functioning autonomously. The piezoelectric polarization field in GaN membrane has excellent mechanical flexibility that the depletion region can be obtained to further enhance UV on/off ratio up to 154% only under 1% strain. While its attributes suggest promise for enhancing PDT precision in clinical settings, further research is needed to evaluate its applicability in deep-seated tumor monitoring. \n\nAccurate measurement of dopamine levels holds potential as an anti-angiogenic agent in combination treatments for breast and colon cancer, thereby enhancing the efficacy of anticancer drugs [154]. Jie et al. introduced an integrated device that incorporates a sensor leveraging the triboelectric effect for detecting neural signals and neurotransmitters [34]. The device switches from Schottky to ohmic contact when exposed to a voltage pulse from the TENG.",

            "text": "Exhibiting biocompatibility, developed surface area and mechanical flexibility, CPs provide improved signal transduction, which allows for the increase in sensitivity of analysis [6]. Additionally, a wide range of immobilization Despite current advancements in genomics, proteomics and bioinformatics, leading to the identification of a plethora of potential biomarkers, there are many barriers affecting the transfer of results from a lab bench to medical practice [4]. The major challenges in the field of bioanalytics are associated with deficiencies in sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of analytical methods. Because of the ultra-low concentration of cancer biomarkers, diagnostic tools need to be highly sensitive and specific. Enhanced sensitivity of a biosensor is, therefore, crucial to find out the ultra-small concentration of the biomarker in the early diagnosis and variation in the concentration of the biomarker during the prognosis to get a picture on the progression of treatment. Consequently, researchers have devoted much attention to making specific biosensors for each target with maximum sensitivity in a practical assay. Due to the heterogeneity of cancer, the concentration of a particular biomarker may vary between different patients and different stages of the disease. Therefore, a recent trend suggests the design of analytical platforms allowing for the simultaneous detection of multiple biomarkers and the analysis of their mutual relationships. \n\nThe detection of cancer biomarkers can be clinically applied not only for the early detection of cancer and accurate pre-treatment staging, but also for the determination of response to treatment and monitoring of disease progression [5]. Even though there are numerous therapies that can be applied to cancer patients (surgical resection, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, hormone therapy, etc.), it is difficult to predict which one will be the most effective for a particular patient. Accordingly, a sensitive biomarker detection system, available at the point-of-care, would be indispensable in the assessment of the efficacy of treatment. For this purpose, conducting polymers (CPs) have recently emerged as promising and versatile materials with remarkable properties suitable for biosensing applications.",

However, the study highlights the potential of such LIFE biomaterials loaded with different types of nanoparticles. Another limitation is that this study is conducted in a subcutaneous tumor model which does not necessarily reflect the complications and intricacies of pancreatic tumors. However, future studies will definitely explore the orthotopic tumor model for pancreatic cancer.

At present, the commonly used method is to directly physically encapsulate semiconducting polymer materials in amphiphilic block polymers to prepare water-soluble polymer fluorescent nanoparticles (SPNs). Not only can this effectively solve the problem of monodispersion of semiconducting polymers in water, but the surface can also be easily functionalized. They have been widely used in the fields of tumor diagnosis [126][127][128] and antibacterials [129][130][131]. Among them [15], polyethylene glycol (PEG) is widely used to modify semiconducting polymers because of its characteristics of increasing drug solubility, reducing body immunity, and prolonging the residence time of drugs in the body [132].",

The unique properties of synthetic polymers, such as tunable functionalities and high sensitivity, complement the biocompatibility and sustainability offered by natural polymers, creating powerful synergy in biosensor design. This combination enables the detection of cancer biomarkers with exceptional accuracy, selectivity, and efficiency. The versatility of polymer-based biosensors allows for real-time monitoring, noninvasive detection, and precise identification of cancerrelated molecules in biological samples. However, the stability and longevity of biosensors present significant challenges that can impede their real-world applications. To address these issues, continued research efforts aimed at optimizing polymer characteristics, improving sensor performance, and exploring novel detection strategies will be crucial in enhancing stability and reducing the oxidation of target molecules. The successful development and application of these biosensors in cancer diagnostics underscore their significance in advancing personalized medicine and enhancing patient care.

            "text": "Interestingly enough, we found that EVs derived from the most aggressive phenotype display an increased content in \u03b2 structures, compared to their epithelial counterpart. Although this has to be considered a preliminary result, which needs to be confirmed on a more statistically robust sample, we believe that it is worth to be commented more in-depth, as similar FTIR results have been already reported measuring blood samples and tissue biopsies, supporting the idea that the average protein conformational state that can be measured with our device is a potential source of novel quantitative EV biomarkers of cancer. For instance, Wang et al. detected a markedly reduced \u03b1-helix/\u03b2-sheet ratio in serum extracted from lung cancer patients compared to control subjects [90]. Analogous finding was demonstrated on murine models by Yamada et al. [91]. Dong et al. analyzed tissue biopsies of CRC patients and control subjects, showing that malignant tissues have more beta than alpha structures compared to normal tissues [62], consistently with our results on EVs. In the same paper, the authors also demonstrate that more than 60% of FTIR data variability between malignant and benign tissues is due to changes in the Amide I/II region, which is also interesting for our purposes as it confirms the potential clinical utility of our device, which is specifically designed to detect these changes in an ultrasensitive fashion. \n\nBesides sensitivity, our device has further advantages over bulk spectroscopic techniques, which are related to the possibility of selecting clinically valuable EV subpopulations. Before discussing this point, we stress that, for the proof of concept of our lab-on-chip, we used a single EV marker, CD63. However, using the same functionalization strategy, our nanorods could be conjugated with different antibodies for different EV surface markers such as EpCAM, which is overexpressed in many types of cancers [92][93][94][95][96][97] or claudin 1,7, and Cadherin-17, which are specific for colorectal cancer [92,[96][97][98]. Targeting these markers would be instrumental for discriminating healthy subjects from cancer patients or for metastasis detection [97].",

Organic semiconductors can be processed at relatively low temperatures, facilitating the formation of well-defined films and layered structures without the need for high-temperature techniques. Additionally, they have elevated triplet-state energy levels and critical transport characteristics [87]. Such attributes allow organic conducting polymers to be utilized in various electronic devices, exhibiting a well-defined energy band gap that allows them to transition between conductive and insulating states. Prominent examples of these organic polymeric semiconductors include polyparaphenylenevinylene (PPV), polyparaphenylene (PPP), polyfluorene (PF), and polyfluorene copolymers [88]. Both organic semiconductors offer significant advantages, such as solution processability and low-temperature deposition, making them suitable for diverse electronic and optoelectronic applications Figure 5. The intrinsic flexibility of organic semiconductors is particularly advantageous for conforming to biological tissues, thereby facilitating the development of medical devices that adhere comfortably to the body's anatomical contours without causing discomfort [90]. These materials are increasingly recognized for their potential in a wide array of biooptoelectronic devices, such as organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs), which serve to power implantable devices including pacemakers and neurostimulators [91]; organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), which are employed in biomedical imaging applications, notably in optogenetics and photodynamic therapy [92]; and organic photodetectors that play a critical role in both in vitro and in vivo biosensing applications, enabling the detection of The intrinsic flexibility of organic semiconductors is particularly advantageous for conforming to biological tissues, thereby facilitating the development of medical devices that adhere comfortably to the body's anatomical contours without causing discomfort [90].",

            "text": "Body fluids typically consist of a diverse array of biomolecules, cells, and vesicles, which can impact the accuracy of liquid biopsies. As such, it is imperative that testing systems for body fluids possess the capability to precisely detect minute quantities of the desired analytes to ensure accurate diagnostic outcomes [55,56]. Hong et al. demonstrated that the multivalent binding of poly(amidoamine) dendritic polymers can enhance the sensitivity of capturing tumor CTCs [57] (Fig. 2D). Given the multivalent binding (affinity) and enhanced short-range adhesion mediated by dendrimers, they proposed a novel nanostructured polymer surface in another study [58]. Through experimentation with different surface structures incorporating multivalent dendrimers, PEG, and tumor-targeting antibodies for the purpose of exosome detection, it was determined that dual-layer dendrimers exhibited the highest capture efficiency. The study found that the levels of exosomes detected in blood samples from patients with tumors were significantly elevated compared to those from healthy individuals, indicating the effectiveness of dendrimer surfaces in identifying tumor exosomes and their potential utility as a new liquid biopsy tool. Furthermore, a novel CTC-capture platform incorporating dendritic polymer-mediated multivalent binding, antibody mixtures, and bionic cell rolling was employed for the detection of RCC-CTCs, resulting in enhanced capture rates of cancer cells [59]. The assays utilizing this platform demonstrated enhanced cancer cell capture rates. Specifically, the use of selectin-mediated cell rolling led to a 1.7-fold increase in the rate of cancer cell capture. Furthermore, a combination of four RCC-CTC surface receptors-EpCAM, CAIX, EGFR, and c-Met -resulted in an 80 % increase in capture rates. Additionally, surfaces coated with dendritic polymers exhibited a capture rate approximately 60 % higher than those without dendritic polymers. The utilization of these methodologies is anticipated to enhance the efficacy of the CTC assay as a biomarker for the timely detection of RCC. Recent research has also emphasized the potential value of platelets as tumor biomarkers [60].",

            "text": "As a top-down coating approach, the use of biological materials is able to bestow synthesized nanoparticles with native cell functionalities [25]. In particular, by extracting the entire membrane from single cells and then linking cell membranes components to the surface of nanoprobes, all biologically relevant surface moieties are transferred and maintained for the biomimetic nanoplatform, such as their biocompatibility, retention of cellular properties, and adaptability [26][27][28]. For example, nanoparticles coating with red blood cell membrane can prolong their circulation time and reduce the accelerated blood clearance [29,30]. In addition, it was discovered that nanoprobes coated with active cell membranes can open a new avenue for passing BBB and targeting glioma [31,32]. Therefore, due to the preserved antigen and cell membrane structure, biomimetic nanoprobes can acquire special functions such as ligand recognition and targeting, long blood circulation and immune escape [33], providing a promising way for the diagnosis of brain tumors. \n\nFurther, multifunctional nanoprobes can serve as the contrast agents for high-sensitivity brain tumor detection [31,34]. In particular, semiconducting polymer dots (Pdots) have received extensive attention in biomedicine due to their outstanding biocompatibility, superior photostability, attractive optoelectronic properties, and abundant functional groups [35][36][37]. More importantly, luminescent conjugated polymers with NIR-II fluorescence properties were inspected, which were able to offer significant improvement for real-time imaging and glioma detection [38][39][40]. For example, Wu et al. developed NIR-II aggregation-induced emission (AIE) active Pdots with enhanced NIR-II fluorescence for through-skull mouse-brain imaging [41]. However, Pdots as exogenous materials, are easily identified by the immune system and quickly cleared by the liver and kidney before they can be transported into the brain [42]. Besides, pure Pdots have difficulties in crossing BBB, showing no specific targeting to brain tumor tissue.",

Passive targeting can be achieved by the enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR) in which the polymeric nanocarriers tend to passively accumulate at the tumor site. To improve this effect, PEGylation of the polymeric NPs particularly in the range of 100 to 200 nm in size can increase the circulation time as well as prevent the opsonization. On the other hand, active targeting can be accomplished by the incorporation of aptamer, protein, peptides, antibodies, nucleic acid, or small molecule onto the surface that can specifically bind to the desired receptor or surface ligand. Hence, the polymeric NPs can actively transport the drug or other therapeutic agent to the tumor site. Similarly, PEGylation can also be incorporated to render the active targeting more effective [114,115]. Naturally, tumor cells have uncontrolled and hyperactive proliferative activity. This forms a unique surrounding known as 'tumor microenvironment' for the tumor cells to gain support and continuously grow and expand. The common conditions of the microenvironment often include lowered or acidic pH, increased level of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and overexpressed tumor-supporting enzymes (Figure 4).

            "text": "Nanomedicine holds promise to enhance cancer immunotherapy; however, its potential to elicit highly specific anti-tumor immunity without compromising immune tolerance has yet to be fully unlocked. This study develops deep-tissue activatable cancer sono-immunotherapy based on the discovery of a semiconducting polymer that generates sonodynamic singlet oxygen (1O2) substantially higher than other sonosensitizers. Conjugation of two immunomodulators via 1O2-cleavable linkers onto this polymer affords semiconducting polymer immunomodulatory nanoparticles (SPINs) whose immunotherapeutic actions are largely inhibited. Under ultrasound irradiation, SPINs generate 1O2 not only to directly debulk tumors and reprogram tumor microenvironment to enhance tumor immunogenicity, but also to remotely release the immunomodulators specifically at tumor site. Such a precision sono-immunotherapy eliminates tumors and prevents relapse in pancreatic mouse tumor model. SPINs show effective antitumor efficacy even in a rabbit tumor model. Moreover, the sonodynamic activation of SPINs confines immunotherapeutic action primarily to tumors, reducing the sign of immune-related adverse events. To improve the specificity of immunotherapy, here the authors report the design of a semiconducting polymer immunomodulatory nanoparticle with sonodynamic process to remotely release immune-modulators for deep-tissue precision cancer sono-immunotherapy.",

The successes of these therapies, with some patients showing durable and complete remission, demonstrate the power of harnessing the immune system to eradicate tumors. However, the effectiveness of current immunotherapies is limited by hurdles ranging from immunosuppressive strategies employed by tumors, to inadequate specificity of existing therapies, to heterogeneity of disease. Further, the vast majority of approved immunotherapies employ systemic delivery of immunomodulators or cells that make addressing some of these challenges more difficult. Natural and synthetic biomaterials\u2013such as biocompatible polymers, self-assembled lipid particles, and implantable biodegradable devices\u2013offer unique potential to address these hurdles by harnessing the benefits of therapeutic targeting, tissue engineering, co-delivery, controlled release, and sensing. However, despite the enormous investment in new materials and nanotechnology, translation of these ideas to the clinic is still an uncommon outcome. Here we review the major challenges facing immunotherapies and discuss how the newest biomaterials and nanotechnologies could help overcome these challenges to create new clinical options for patients.",

            "text": "Over the last decade, polymeric NPs have been designed to overcome the limitations of free therapeutics for the treatment of cancer. Polymeric NPs have shown a more favorable pharmacokinetic profile than the free chemotherapeutics, but optimization of the formulation, in terms of the polydispersity and size of the NPs, is still needed to improve efficacy. In the same way, drug release from polymeric NPs can be more precisely controlled, with a range of polymers designed specifically for that purpose. In this sense, therapeutic polymers emerge as polymers with pharmaceutical and biomedical applications, and with a promising future in cancer research. On the other hand, selective-targeting tumoral cells can augment the permeability and penetration of the polymeric NPs within the tumor, and, therefore, diminish toxicity and avoid the adverse effects of prolonged treatment. For this purpose, guided polymeric NPs may provide benefit over NPs when targeting receptors that also have a biological effect. \n\nIn conclusion, although great advances have been performed, there is still a long way to go, and combined efforts from the scientific and biotechnology community are needed in order to speed up the development of this technology.",

Biopsies may not correctly represent tumor heterogeneity since they depend on the sample location. 101 Tissue biopsy for prognostic monitoring is too intrusive. Traditional tumor indicators are not clinically useful. A unique noninvasive detection method that can fully characterize tumors, enable early cancer screening, and properly evaluate treatment efficacy is needed. 102 It is widely acknowledged that the growth of cancerous tumors results in the release of diverse constituents into the bloodstream. 103 These constituents encompass circulating tumor cells (CTCs), tumor-derived DNA (ctDNA), various EVs, proteins, and metabolites. 104 In recent studies, there has been a notable emphasis on investigating EVs to develop varieties of diagnostic techniques further. One notable characteristic of EVs is their presence in diverse bodily fluids. 105 n contrast to conventional tissue biopsies, which necessitate intricate sampling methods and are invasive, liquid biopsies utilizing EVs provide several advantages. These include the ability to monitor tumor progression over time, assess longterm therapy response, facilitate recurrent sampling, and enable simplified sampling management. In addition, it is worth noting that conventional biopsies that rely on symptom presentation may be inadequate in identifying early stage cancer because of the delayed manifestation of some symptoms. Conversely, EV-based liquid biopsy, operating at the genetic level, has the potential to overcome the constraints associated with symptom-based approaches and enable the early detection of cancer. 106 \u2212119 Furthermore, recent advancements in highsensitivity detection techniques have facilitated the attainment of specific procedures to achieve a level of a single EV. 120 Biosensors have been employed in medical and biological areas worldwide for decades as fast, dependable, and precise analytical procedures.

            "text": "It is becoming increasingly clear that the development of effective biomedical devices relies on engineering of the biotic/abiotic interface. 1,2 Most biosensors or biomedical devices consist of a physical, mechanical, or electrical transducer coupled to a biorecognition element. Improved performance for these sensors and devices can be achieved through biofunctionalization, where a biorecognition element is physically or chemically coupled to the transducer. Improved performance may be attributed to numerous factors including long-term stability, increased signal transduction, and of course specificity. The nature of the biofunctionalization can vary from relatively weak van der Waals type reversible bonds, to strong (and usually irreversible) covalent bonds. The method of biofunctionalization used depends on the surface exposed by the transducer, the nature of the biomolecule to be bound, and the particular needs of each application. For long term stability, covalent binding of the biomolecule is preferred, whereas for more acute applications, electrostatic or even secondary interactions may suffice. In this review we focus on the biofunctionalization of a particular class of materials called conducting polymers (CPs) which are coming to the forefront as novel alternatives to traditional electronics in certain niche applications. More specifically, we focus on polydioxythiophene based conducting polymers, including poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and poly (3,4-propylene dioxythiophene) (PProDOT) (Fig. 1). \n\nCPs came to the forefront in 1976 with research done by Alan MacDiarmid, Hideki Shirakawa and Alan Heeger, and have since been shown to display many desirable characteristics for a variety of applications. 3,4 An important example is their mixed conductivity; in CPs, electrons move primarily along the conjugated backbone of the polymer, but charge hopping between chains also occurs. CPs typically have an open microstructure that allows for facile ionic transport. This mixed (electronic and ionic) conductivity has been shown to be very useful for certain biomedical applications. 5",

            "text": "Prior to its diagnosis, cancer malignancy begins with the invasion of motile cancer cells into the circulatory system [1]. In recent years, many researchers have been searching for ways to identify these rare cells in the circulatory systems through regular liquid biopsies that include the collection of small amounts of specific cancer cells from blood vessel systems [2]. To date, however, only the Cell-Search System-using microbeads magnetically labeled with epithelial cell adhesion molecule antibodies (anti-EpCAM)-has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the enrichment of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) during liquid biopsies [3]. Because the structural heterogeneity of CTCs makes it difficult to capture them during their circulation in the blood, the ability to do so would presumably be of major interest in the fields of cancer biology and biomedical engineering. \n\nIntegrating bio-responsive materials with polymers through surface modification, top-down structural design, and molecularly based cascade structures should lead to many new applications in the upcoming years [4]. In the field of polymer processing and manufacturing, the capture of CTCs became possible after the discovery that skeletal structures having very narrow dimensions (e.g., nanofibers) could be integrated with the extracellular matrices of cells [4,5]. Such nanoscale fibers can be spun using high voltage saturation, in a process known as electrospinning, which has been gaining increasing attention in applied medical and biomedical engineering [6]. Selecting the compounds most suitable for electrospinning remains a challenge; at present, raw polymers are employed predominantly, but the use of surface-modified polymers is growing.",

            "text": "The application of specific conducting polymers in sensor design has been observed to create a synergistic effect, resulting in sufficient sensitivity and selectivity [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10]. The conducting polymers, with their semiconducting properties [11][12][13][14] can be deposited over the signal transducer [15,16]. Chemical [17], electrochemical [12], enzymatic [18], and/or microorganism-assisted [19][20][21] formation methods have been applied previously for the formation of conducting polymers on the electrode. Although many natural recognition elements, such as enzymes [22][23][24], antigens [25], antibodies [2], DNA [26] and various receptors [27], in the sensor design can bind selected targets and provide advanced selectivity for biosensors, these natural recognition elements have some challenges to overcome, such as expensive synthesis, analytical instruments, skilled staff, stability only for days at room temperature, and poor compatibility with transducer surfaces. In this case, MIPs are an excellent alternative to sensors based on biomolecules [2,28], as they can be stable in a variety of conditions (pH, temperature, ionic strength, solvents) and allow inexpensive synthesis, label-free detection, and long-term storage without loss in performance (several months to years) [29]. The determination of particular biomarkers is used for the diagnosis of various diseases. The research of biological samples similar to samples of traditional Chinese medicine also faces challenges, such as matrix complexity, component diversity, and low levels of active components [30]. Commercially available sensors with validated properties are essential in healthcare systems [31]. Mustafa et al. [32], in their review article, overviewed the state-of-the-art of MIP sensor technologies in diagnostics and the application of MIPs for accessing analytes in biofluids.",

            "text": "Optical characterization of both HDAPPs and HA-HDAPPs shows their characteristic photothermal excitation and fluorescent emission within the biologically optimal NIR window 22 . In addition to the benefit of NIR-availability, both HDAPPs and HA-HDAPPs are non-cytotoxic, colloidally stable in aqueous solutions, and reproducibly heat and fluoresce, serving as an ideal theranostic for tumor imaging and ablation 22,24 . HA-HDAPPs demonstrated increased binding potential relative to non-targeted HDAPPs with a 1 h binding incubation; however, there was insufficient binding of HA-HDAPPs (a maximum of 2 \u00d7 10 9 NP) to achieve ablation, leading to the negative results in Supplementary Figure S9. This result is mainly due to the fact that when the HDAPPs NPs are utilized, an insufficient amount of the photothermally active agent is delivered to the CT26 CRC cells (the BSe polymer, which comprises only 1/10 of the HDAPPs formulation). Our team has previously evaluated the optimal ratios of the fluorescent polymer PFBTDBT10 and PCPDTBSe in a nanoparticle formulation to maximize the fluorescent component, while still offering heating for mild hyperthermia 22 . Unfortunately, combining these two polymers leads to chain interaction and subsequent fluorescence quenching. To address this deficiency, we developed HA-BSe NPs based on our previously formulated BSe NP 43 . Successful reduction in 2D viability (Fig. 3c), using HA-BSe NPs suggested that sufficient binding was in fact achieved for efficacious photothermal therapy. Future directions of the HDAPPs formulation will include molecular spacers to minimize PFBTDBT10 and PCPDTBSe polymer chain interactions, thus reducing fluorescence quenching and allowing for increased amounts of the heat generating polymer to be incorporated in HDAPPs. \n\nThis work represents the first exploration into the photothermal activity of organic semiconducting polymer nanoparticles in bioengineered 3D tumor tissue constructs (organoids).",

            "text": "In this review, we summarize how biomaterials can enhance cancer immunotherapies by addressing some of the challenges of these approaches, which have been at the forefront of pharmaceutical breakthroughs in recent years and will continue to be so. Through their localized action and controlled release of cells, cancer antigens, drugs, immunomodulatory molecules, or combinations thereof, biomaterials can overcome the problem of rapid cell and antigen dispersion, as well as toxicity related to systemic delivery, and allow the combination of several products, with or without exogenous cells to eliminate cancer more efficiently. \n\nFor cancer vaccines, biomaterials can address numerous limitations that have so far hindered their progress toward the clinic. Multiple studies indicate increased potency using biomaterial vaccines compared to free vaccine components intravenously or subcutaneously injected, one factor of which is likely the \"immune niche\" created in porous biomaterials. This environment encourages antigen uptake by DC, often in a space that is protected from the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment to concurrently improve DC persistence. Furthermore, biomaterials allow the inclusion of immunostimulatory adjuvants or drugs, in addition to the antigens or tumor cell lysates, and the controlled release of these factors further increases their potency. Exogenous DC cells can also be added to ensure a greater number of activated DC cells, although this implies more complicated preparation steps and regulations. Such products will most probably be used in the future, at least to prevent cancer recurrence or fight metastasis. The main limitations at this stage are on one hand, the absence of ideal injectable porous scaffolds, and on the other, limited persistence and long-term efficacy, with a lack of clinical data. \n\nBiomaterial scaffolds for drug delivery offer similar benefits in terms of controlled and localized release of therapeutics, which increases the potency of ICI and allows combination therapies, for instance with chemotherapies. Localized biomaterial delivery also allows reduced dosages and hence a reduction in the toxicity associated with both chemotherapies and immunotherapies.",

            "text": "However, the material itself has poor biocompatibility, and it is prone to fluorescence aggregation quenching or quenching by water in a physiological environment [13,14]. Semiconducting polymers also have many excellent characteristics, for example, good photostability and photothermal performance, easy functional modification of the surface of the material, and good biocompatibility. However, the molecular weight is not easy to control during the preparation process, and the metabolic mechanism in the human body is still unclear [15,16]. \n\nFluorescent polymer nanomaterials are prepared by physically doping or chemically bonding amphiphilic block polymers and fluorescent functional materials [17,18]. The composite material has the characteristics of good optical stability and wide application range of functional fluorescent materials. Additionally, it is also possible to select polymer monomers with different functions; while retaining the good water solubility and excellent biocompatibility of polymer nanomaterials, the controllable synthesis of properties such as size, morphology, stability, and surface properties can be achieved [19,20]. The complementary advantages of the two provide new ideas for expanding the application range of fluorescent functional materials in the field of biomedicine and have attracted the extensive attention of scientific researchers [21][22][23]. \n\nIn summary, this paper discusses the functionalization strategy of fluorescent polymers and the preparation methods for fluorescent polymer nanomaterials. It also systematically introduces the research and development status and application prospects of fluorescent polymer nanomaterials based on rare earth luminescent materials, semiconducting polymers, and small organic molecules from recent years. It is emphasized that the design and application of fluorescent polymer nanomaterials should be functionalized from the perspective of synthesis and optimization according to need. Finally, the development direction and challenges of polymer nanomaterials in the fields of optics and medical tumors are prospected.",

            "text": "Herein, we reviewed the progress of research on polymeric NPs in oral cancer prevention, diagnosis and treatment. Polymeric NPs provide new platforms and ideas for the diagnosis and treatment of oral cancer that are worth exploring in greater depth. During the last decade, research in nanotechnology in the field of medical oncology has been in full swing. However, the polymeric NPs also have drawbacks: research indicates that some polymeric NPs are prone to hazardous degradation and toxic monomer aggregation, necessitating further research into their synthesis and chemical characteristics. Importantly, there are still some pressing issues in the study of polymeric nanoagents for oral cancer applications. Changes in the tumour microenvironment (e.g., temperature and pH) often affect the effectiveness of nanoplatform-based drug delivery systems. In this context, NPs regarding the tumor microenvironmental response are being studied extensively, still not in oral cancer. The large discrepancies between the results of in vivo and in vitro experiments have raised major doubts concerning the effectiveness of nanosystems in humans. In addition, the targeting efficiency of polymer NPs in vivo has not achieved the desired effects. Due to the lack of specific markers in oral cancer, since some proteins that are overexpressed on the surface of tumour cells also exist in normal cells, the manner to further improve the efficiency of passive and active targeting remains to be elucidated. \n\nThere is no denying that nanotechnology, especially polymeric nanocarrier platforms, has the potential to be the most effective and beneficial form of treatment and diagnosis of cancer in the future. Further research is needed to translate nanotechnology concepts into practical applications. In the coming years, it will play a key role in early tumour detection, diagnosis and treatment procedures. However, polymer NPs-based diagnosis and treatment of oral cancer still has a long future.",

            "text": "Efficient PSs are highly desirable in photoactivated disease diagnosis and treatment, which is beneficial not only to generate ROS effectively killing cancer cells but also to induce more sufficient ICD to accelerate the development of antitumor immunotherapy. 134 As we know, the 1 O 2 yield is considered as one of the most crucial indicators in the process of photosensitization, which can be controlled by adjusting the ISC for better performance in cancer treatment. 135 Organic semiconducting polymers have been found to have an advantage in promoting the ISC process, which exhibits a higher 1 O 2 generation efficiency and stronger light-harvesting ability than small-molecular analogues do. In this section, several cases of organic semiconducting polymers were exemplified owing to their splendid cancer treatment ability. \n\nIn 2018, Tang's group put forward two efficient strategies to enhance the photosensitization efficiency:  degrading PD-L1 (Figure 11A). 137 Unlike traditional ICB therapy, this brand-new approach avoiding some potential problems such as high cost, difficulty for storage, high risk of immunogenicity, and short half-life in biological systems further guarantees its application in IPDT. The experimental results indicated that SPSS NPs can not only produce highlevel ROS but also elicit strong ICD to release DAMPs, which could evoke long-term immunological memory against tumor rechallenge. This work offers a new idea by combining welldesigned photosensitizer-based ICD induction and proteins, rendering great promise for cancer immunotherapy. \n\nIn addition, a different IPDT modality \"immunometabolic photodynamic therapy\" triggered by organic semiconducting polymers was proposed by Pu and co-workers. This approach aims to modulate the cancer metabolic pathway by releasing immunotherapeutic drugs that bond with specific targets to promote the proliferation of effector T cells and suppress immune escape, which could minimize side effects like immune-related adverse events (Figure 11B). 138 Thus, a KYNase-conjugated semiconducting polymer nanozyme (SPNK) was designed for IPDT.",

Furthermore, cytotoxics without sufficient potency, inefficient internalization, limited expression of the target antigen and immunogenicity of Mabs (Alley et al., 2009;Chari, 2008).\n\nSecond-generation ADCs were designed to deliver potent anticancer agents to tumors in a targeted manner to limit systemic exposure.

            "text": "Despite progress in the prevention and diagnosis of cancer, current technologies for tumor detection present several limitations including invasiveness, toxicity, inaccuracy, lengthy testing duration and high cost. Therefore, innovative diagnostic techniques that integrate knowledge from biology, oncology, medicinal and analytical chemistry are now quickly emerging in the attempt to address these issues. Following this approach, here we developed a paper-based electrochemical device for detecting cancer-derived Small Extracellular Vesicles (S-EVs) in fluids. S-EVs were obtained from cancer cell lines known to express, at a different level, the \u03b1v\u03b26 integrin receptor, a well-established hallmark of numerous epithelial cancer types. The resulting biosensor turned out to recognize \u03b1v\u03b26-containing S-EVs down to a limit of 0.7*10^3 S-EVs/mL with a linear range up to 10^5 S-EVs /mL, and a relative standard deviation of 11%, thus it may represent a novel opportunity for \u03b1v\u03b26 expressing cancers detection. The detection of cancer in its early stages can greatly prevent disease development, however, current technologies for tumor detection present several limitations. Here, the authors develop a paper-based electrochemical device for detecting cancer-derived small extracellular vesicles (S-EVs) in fluids, recognizing \u03b1v\u03b26-containing S-EVs down to a limit of 0.7*10^3 S-EVs/mL with a linear range up to 10^5 S-EVs/mL.",

            "text": "There are many types of nanoparticles, including metallic, magnetic, polymeric, metal oxide, quantum dots, graphene, fullerene, liposomes, carbon nanotubes, and dendrimers, which are used in breast, colon, and cervical cancer diagnosis. Additionally, they are important for some imaging functions. It has been found that nanoparticles remain in the blood circulation for a long period of time before reaching the target cells, where they traverse many biological walls such as cell membranes and interact with biological systems (Figure 2). Moreover, cancer-specific antibodies can be conjugated with nanoparticles for better cancer binding and detection. Many recent studies have demonstrated that nanoparticles and sensors have significant potential for increasing the sensitivity of tumor detection and improving cancer diagnosis [13]. It has been reported that the detection of methylation patterns and mutations has been used as a marker for cancer diagnosis. It has been suggested that more studies are required before using extracellular vesicles, circulating tumor cells, and cell-free RNA in clinical diagnosis [14]. Researchers have used fluorescent gold nanoclusters (GNCs) or superparamagnetic (Fe 3 O 4 /GNCs), (\u03b3-Mercaptopropyl) trimethoxysilane (MPS) as a stabilizing agent. The prepared GNCs@MPS was conjugated on the surface of \"Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 nanoparticles\" followed by the addition of \"poly ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (PGD)\" to form Fe 3 O 4 /GNCs nanoprobes. It has been found that (Fe 3 O 4 /GNCs/Aptamer) is capable of uptake in HL60 cancer cells [15]. Various metallic nanoparticles have shown better sensitivity in detecting tumor cells as they can be conjugated with cancer-specific antibodies and penetrate cancer cells more effectively. Studies have reported that nanocomposites containing more than one type of nanoparticle, such as gold, platinum, silver, copper, and cobalt, are better candidates for cancer detection and imaging.",

The Reviewer considers the work interesting as well as the idea to develop an easy technique for early detection of cancer. Here the Reviewer's suggestions: -The core of the project is the capability to detect and discriminate cancer EV based on the detection of the integrin receptor concentration. The authors show enhanced values of the biomarker for all cells considered in the study (DU145R80 (R80), PC3, HCT116 and A549). \n\nAlthough the results are promising, the results are obtained only with positive controls. The reviewer considers very important for this study to consider different cell-lines associate to benign tumours or infections, in general not associated to malignant tumours, that could affect the biomarker levels. This is important to validate the system's capability to discriminate not only cancer from no-cancer, but also from different forms of diseases. \n\nThe authors deeply thank the Referee for the observation, which gives us the opportunity to clarify some issues that were not enough explained in the original paper and to add new cell lines to further challenge the biosensor. a) Concerning the utilization of S-EVs from non-cancerous diseases \"so to validate the system's capability to discriminate not only cancer from no-cancer, but also from different forms of diseases\", we highlight that, as far as our current understanding extends, the application of S-EVs for diseases such as neurodegenerative, cardiovascular, or infectious conditions is still in its early stages. Even less information is known about the role of \u03b1v\u03b26 in these diseases. To the best of our knowledge, the singular exception, aside from cancers, where \u03b1v\u03b26 is overexpressed, is idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis-a rare condition affecting 0.09-1.30 individuals per 10,000.",

            "text": "The versatile and beneficial properties of polymers have been exploited to facilitate protein detection in all areas of the aforementioned methods. A wide range of polymeric materials is already commercially available or synthetically accessible. Their surface chemistry can be easily tailored for the immobilization of proteins. In addition to these benefits, cost-effective polymers can be produced in large quantities. They can be easily handled and fabricated into assorted platforms. Polymers can withstand the thermal fluctuations that are typically required in standard biomedical protocols. Owing to these advantages, polymers have been used not only as sensing materials and signal-enhancing components of various detection devices but also as supporting substrates and mediating layers for promoting/suppressing protein adsorption. As a result, polymers are commonly found in protein detection technology, especially based on optical, electrochemical, and mass-sensitive mechanisms. When choosing polymers for protein detection, multiple factors such as biocompatibility and hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity are carefully considered for the specific need in each application. Two main reasons for applying polymers in various protein detection systems are to increase specificity and sensitivity. For example, some polymers [82][83][84] have been frequently employed to provide an additional layer for promoting protein adsorption and for increasing protein stability on various sensor surfaces. On the other hand, other polymers have been used as inhibition layers to suppress nonspecific protein adsorption on sensors [85][86][87]. Molecular imprinting polymers (MIPs) are applied to the electrochemical detection of proteins in order to increase biomolecular selectivity. They permit the creation of specific protein recognition sites in synthetic polymers through template molecule-assisted copolymerization of functional monomers. When the template molecules are removed from the polymer, complementary binding sites to subsequent template molecules are constructed in the polymer [88,89]. Figure 2(a) is one such example of MIP protein sensors. Conducting polymers (CPs), a group of polymers exhibiting good electrical conductivity (10 \u221211 to 10 3 S/cm with a carrier concentration ranging between 10 12 and 10 19 /cm 3 ), have been used to increase the detection sensitivity of protein detection systems such as FETs [11,81,90,91].",

The lowest detected concentration of target miRs was about 10 pM. \n\nGraphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanosheet can be used to design assays similar to those discussed below and exploiting the quenching of labelled PNA probes [96,99]. Carbon nitride nanosheet (CNNS) can be exfoliated from bulk g-C3N4 and directly dispersed in aqueous solution [100]. \n\nIn addition, in this case, the recovery of the fluorescence emitted by labelled PNA probes adsorbed on CNNS when in contact with complementary miR sequences is used to assay miR in the complex medium [33]. \n\nConsiderable attention is today devoted to the fabrication of biosensing devices using low-cost and flexible materials for applications also in resource-limited settings [101]. In this perspective, a poly(vinylidene fluoride) thin sheet impregnated with poly(3-alkoxy-4-methylthiophene) (PT) and modified with a PNA probe can be used for the optical detection of miR [34]. The assay has been designed to perform a naked eye detection of miR-21 associated with lung cancer. Different optical signatures are generated when the non-specific adsorption of miR on the polymeric sheet or the specific interaction with the complementary PNA probe are established. In particular, an orange fluorescence signal is generated when the triplex system PT-PNA-miR-21 is formed. The assay shows a linear correlation in the 10 nM-10 mM concentration range as well as a successful mismatch detection. \n\nCationic polythiophene derivatives can be used as the active layer for a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) surface modification to detect miR-21 spiked in plasma samples [35]. Negatively charged miR adsorbs on cationic polythiophene. The specific capture of miRs in complex media can be performed using biotinylated PNA sequence complementary to the miR target.",

Advances in these areas will undoubtedly form the major cornerstones for a future medical practice of personalized oncology. Cancer detection, diagnosis, and therapy will be tailored to each individual's tumor molecular profile and used in predictive oncology, whereby genetic/molecular markers will play an essential role in the prediction of disease development, progression, and clinical outcomes. The probability of a successful treatment modality increases dramatically if tumor cells can be selectively removed before they evolve to their mature stages and metastases production. As such, novel and more sensitive diagnostic tools like metallic and semiconducting nanoparticles are being developed with the aim of improving the early and noninvasive detection of rising malignancies and the accuracy of tumor tissue localization. Paramagnetic nanoparticles, quantum dots, nanoshells and nanosomes represent some of these new technologies, used for diagnostic purposes (See Figure 4). Compared to conventional materials, inorganic nanomaterials provide several advantages such as simple preparative processes and precise control over their shape, composition and size. These systems provide promising potential not only in diagnostics, but also as delivery systems for therapeutic agents and are discussed in detail below. Fig. 4. Nanoparticles used in cancer diagnosis and treatment. Liposomes contain amphiphilic molecules, which have hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups that self-assemble in water. Gold nanoparticles are solid metal particles that are conventionally coated with drug molecules, proteins, or oligonucleotides. Quantum dots consist of a core-and-shell structure (e.g., CdSe coated with zinc and sulfide with a stabilizing molecule and a polymer layer coated with a protein). Fullerenes (typically called \"buckyballs\" because they resemble Buckminster Fuller's geodesic dome) and carbon nanotubes have only carbon-to-carbon bonds.",

Remarkable results were obtained by Huynh et al. in 2015 when they described the production of convertible porphyrin microbubbles ( pMBs) for multimodal PA/US imaging. 224 They first built micellar microbubbles encapsulating perfluorocarbon gas using the porphyrin-containing bacteriochlorophyll-lipid (BChl-lipid), generating a microparticle displaying US contrast due to the high acoustic impedance of gasses and PA and fluorescence imaging due to absorption from porphyrin groups. Moreover, by exposure to low-frequency US waves, the microbubbles were transformed into smaller particles (5-500 nm) with the same optical properties as the former. After the stability of the PA contrast had been assessed in vitro, tumor-bearing mice were injected with 150 \u00b5L of 8.4 \u00d7 10 7 pMBs solution to study and verify PA contrast and the micro-to-nano transformation by PA imaging.

PCPDBTB is a semiconducting polymer with absorption in the NIR (840 nm), while PC70BM is a highly electrophilic and hydrophilic fullerene that enables intramolecular PET contrast. Thanks to HOMO-LUMO coupling between the polymer and the fullerene units, increasing amounts of fullerenes caused sensitive increment of PA signal in the NIR. Hence",

            "text": "In this manuscript, the role of porous flexible polyimide substrate on electrochemical biosensing performance was evaluated. The pores in the flexible substrate allows for effective wicking of low volumes (\u2264 20 \u03bc L) of fluid and confinement of target biomolecular species in close proximity to the sensing electrode surfaces. Such confinement mechanisms are especially relevant for biosensors that employ affinity based mechanisms for detection of target species. While this work focused on EIS as the method of detection, the confinement based enhancement of signal is expected to also benefit other modes of detection. By using different electrode materials, we demonstrated metal oxide semiconducting performs better than metallic thin films for signal amplification of biomolecular interactions and that nanostructured metal oxide semiconducting films can significantly enhance the sensitivity of biomolecular detection. A three order lower limit of detection compared to current handheld POC diagnostic devices was demonstrated for cardiac troponin biomarker, cTnT in HS. Thus, flexible porous substrates with functionalized semiconducting surfaces allows for enhanced charge transfer on the sensing surfaces and is therefore suited for rapid and sensitive, low-cost strip based biosensors in POC diagnostic devices. Studies were conducted to understand the influence of nanostructure growth on porous substrate towards understanding ease of manufacturability. Finally, the effects of mechanical handing such as cyclic bending of the flexible strips was studied to demonstrate minimal loss of sensing performance. Further mechanistic studies are needed to understand the effect of strain on biomolecular binding efficacy for establishing robustness and reliability of such flexible electrochemical sensor platforms.",

The PDs bioconjugates were able to label cellular targets in an effective and specific manner, including a cell surface marker on human breast cancer cells, with no need to detect nonspecific binding. The authors demonstrated that the fluorescence exhibited by PDlabeled MCF-7 cells was 25 times higher than that of QDlabeled cells and 18 times higher than that of Alexa Fluor-labeled cells, according to flow cytometry analysis [67]. Based on the results, the authors believe that these ultrabright nanoparticles were successfully bioconjugated. Thus, this strategy provides a new opportunity for applying versatile semiconducting polymers to different fluorescence measurement methods in biomedicine and modern biology. \n\nUpconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) are usually selected for fluorescent labeling considering the ability to excite UCNPs with near-infrared (NIR) light to infrared (IR) light for generation of fluorescence emission in the visible region of the spectrum, leading to minimal background noise. Furthermore, applying NIR light as the excitation source prevents damage to normal tissues on one hand and allows deep tissue penetration on the other hand [68]. \n\nShen et al. [69] described a simple method to conjugate multifunctional nanoparticles (MFNPs) assembled by the formation of various layers with a monoclonal anti-HER2 antibody and confirmed that the MFNPs exhibited the specific detection of breast cancer BT474 cells (biomarker HER2 positive) with a high signal-to-noise ratio. The MFNPs have an obvious core-shell structure of UCNP@-Fe3O4@Au coated with anti-HER2 antibody and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and exhibited an outstanding dispersity in different aqueous solutions and a high signalto-noise ratio.",

            "text": "cinoma as well as for other cancers that cause inflammation, can be detected at lower limits of 30 pg/mL in serum. While patient blood analysis would be the eventual application for this nanotechnology, the ability to sensitively detect the tumor biomarker in serum demonstrates its relevance to potential usage in medical diagnostics. (Fetal calf serum is often used to simulate the assay conditions of a highly complex sample.) To be biologically relevant, the detection limit must be lowered at least 2-fold to the diseased target concentration of 19.5 pg/mL, and even lower for normal levels present at less than 6 pg/mL (116). To increase sensitivity, the same research group attached a multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT), containing over 100 HRP molecules (Fig. 6d), to the detection antibody that provides amplification through current generation (Fig. 6e). With this enhanced system, the authors lowered the detection limit below healthy levels, with a 60-fold increase in sensitivity to 0.5 pg/mL, in fetal calf serum (117). This assay can be improved by multiplexing, so that a panel of biomarkers can be detected in a single sample, thereby increasing the test's diagnostic confidence. For diagnosing prostate cancer, four relevant biomarkers (PSA, PSMA, IL-6, and PF-4) can be tested with nanotube forests arrayed across four individual electrodes (118).\n\nCarbon nanotubes can also be used as FETs (Fig. 7), where binding of an analyte to an anchored antibody causes a change in the environment near the surface of the nanotube, thereby altering the electrical conductance (119,120). CNT-FET is expedient because only one antibody is required to capture the antigen and report a signal, as opposed to the dual antibody system described above. This was first shown in biomarker detection using an IgG against the tumor marker, Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (121). Later, engineered scFv antibodies were immobilized on Nickel nanoparticle coated nanotubes through the polyhistidine\u00c1Ni interaction. This resulted in a highly dense and orientation specific attachment and a subsequent 10-fold",

            "text": "Cancer is still the second-leading cause of death worldwide, with an estimated 10 million cancer-related deaths reported in 2020 (Miller et al., 2019;Sung et al., 2021). According to the data reported by Globocan in 2020, lung cancer accounted for 18% of cancer-related deaths, followed by colorectal cancer (9.4%), liver cancer (8.3%), stomach cancer (7.7%), and breast cancer (6.9%) (Sung et al., 2021). Early screening for cancer in both healthy and high-risk populations can help detect cancer early, which greatly improves the opportunity for intervention and reduces mortality. Currently, most solid tumor diagnoses rely on imaging, and are then confirmed by tissue biopsy. However, the information obtained from a biopsy is influenced by the location from which the tumor tissue is taken and may not reflect the heterogeneity of the tumor. Moreover, because of the invasive nature of tissue biopsy, it cannot be performed routinely for monitoring prognosis. In addition, traditional tumor markers are also limited and often unsatisfactory for clinical use (Ju et al., 2014). Therefore, there is an urgent need for a novel non-invasive detection method that can fully clarify tumor characteristics and screen for early detection of cancer or accurately assess treatment efficacy (Ju et al., 2014;Marrugo-Ram\u00edrez et al., 2018). Compared with traditional tissue biopsy, liquid biopsy and blood-based biomarkers can detect tumor-related genetic changes and better identify disease recurrence or acquired resistance before clinical symptoms appear (Skotland et al., 2017;Wang et al., 2017;Marrugo-Ram\u00edrez et al., 2018).\n\nAs a circulating biomarker for cancer, extracellular vesicles (EVs) have gradually attracted wide attention in recent years (Petersen et al., 2020;Chen et al., 2021). EVs are cell-secreted nanoparticles involved in diverse pathological processes of tumors (He et al., 2018). Hypoxic, acidic, and inflammatory tumor microenvironments can enhance EV secretion (Parolini et al., 2009;Ramteke et al., 2015;",

In another study, Gupta et al. [107] designed a biosensor for the MUC1 biomarker with a conducting polymer nanocomposite of AuNPs, GO, and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT). The high electrical conductivity and superior electrochemical stability of PEDOT make it an attractive sensor platform due to its biocompatibility [125,126]. They found that the PEDOT considerably enhanced the electrochemical properties of the nanocomposite, while the AuNPs and GO enhanced the electroactive surface area of the AuNPs-GO-PEDOT electrode, thereby improving the electrochemical sensing performance. As a result, the AuNPs-GO-PEDOT provided a highly sensitive platform for measuring MUC1, with an LOD of 0.031 fM, and an LR of 3.13 aM to 31.25 nM. \n\nThe differentiation-44 (CD44) antigen is a transmembrane glycoprotein found on cell surfaces [127]. Several studies have shown that CD44 is expressed on the surface of cancer stem cells, which may contribute to cancer beginning and development. Numerous cancers are associated with high CD44 concentrations, including breast, prostate, lung, colon, etc. [128,129]. Moreover, CD44 has been found to exhibit metastatic cancerous behavior in clinical studies, thereby suggesting that it can serve as a BC biomarker. Therefore, the CD44 antigen could serve as a key early-stage biomarker for investigating BC growth [130,131].",

A specialized OETB based on PEDOT-PSS channel and poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) reservoir can detect these circulating tumor cells (Figure 8b) [126]. It utilizes chemically conjugated specific antibodies on the conductive film surface to selectively capture tumor cells. By monitoring the effective gate voltage potential shift, the number of captured cells on the conductive film can be determined, enabling accurate cell detection and highthroughput screening. For instance, when the concentration of cancer cells reached 5000, the captured cells completely covered the PEDOT-PSS surface, resulting in an observed effective gate voltage shift of approximately 63 mV.",

            "text": "From the detective methods of lung cancer, we see that although there are some limitations that the data derived from an individual patient may not be representative, and the nanomaterials-induced endothelial leakiness should be taken into account. The use of NPs-protein corona-based technology in screens for early diagnosis and treatment of various diseases helps people diagnose lung cancer earlier and get treated and prognosis properly and in time. \n\nConsidering the detection of PDAC, two types of nanomaterials are analysed, including liposome and graphene oxide. What liposome-protein corona is constituted of and how the structure is will be significantly changed by being exposed to the plasma of individuals with pancreatic cancer, while it can also be detected through incubating nanoflakes of graphene oxide with healthy individuals' and diagnosed PDAC patients' samples of blood. Though both of them have noticeable limitations, it is irrefragable that they are with great performances among all nanomaterials. Thus they have been the focus of investigations of protein-corona-based tests of cancer. \n\nAnd as for breast cancer, where a newly investigated method is mentioned, we find explorations in new nanoparticles are also necessary for earlier and more accurate cancer detection. Despite its immaturity technology and lack of clinic trails, it proves to be a better solution for breast cancer diagnoses soon because of its security and accuracy. \n\nBy giving an overview of all these methods, no matter mature or newly developed, it can be derived that detecting methods involving the use of nanoparticles and biomolecules do show advantages while compared with conventional ones. Those superiorities include: a. \n\nHigh sensitivity Conventional physical methods to detect cancers mainly start with the discovery of a lump. This means that only when the cancer cells develop and spread to a certain degree can they be observed and diagnosed. Commonly seen cancers like breast cancer, lung cancer, however, show no or little symptoms at early stages, and the patients might have missed the most proper time of cure when the cancer is diagnosed. However, based on nanoparticles, the diagnostic method is developed by specific affinity to certain proteins to allow patients to have early detection. \n\nb.

            "text": "SPNs, as a class of optical materials transformed from semiconducting polymers (SPs) with excellent optical properties and biocompatibility, have also been used for NIR-II PTT and thus can mediate NIR-II PTT combinational immunotherapy [57][58][59]. To enhance the therapeutic efficacy of SPNs, Zhang and Pu's groups developed a polymer multicellular nanoengager for synergistic NIR-II photothermal immunotherapy [60]. The nanoengager consisted of NIR-II-absorbing SPs as the photothermal agents and the surface camouflaged cell membranes derived from DCs and immunologically engineered tumor cells serving as the cancer vaccine shells. Such a design enabled multicellular engagements among T cells, DCs, and tumor cells, resulting in the enhanced activation of DCs and T cells. These nanoengagers could effectively accumulate into both lymph nodes and tumor tissues after systemic administration and acted as nanovaccines to trigger the immune response. Under 1064 nm laser irradiation (1.0 W/cm 2 , 10 min), the nanoengagers exerted NIR-II PTT to eradicate tumors and induce ICD for further eliciting antitumor T cell immunity. The nanoengager-mediated NIR-II PTT synergistic immunotherapy not only efficiently inhibited the growth of both primary and distant 4T1 tumors and eliminated tumor recurrence but also triggered immunological memory for long-term immune surveillance. \n\nThe SPN-mediated NIR-II photothermal effect has also been used to achieve the ondemand release of immunotherapeutic drugs in target tumor tissues for safe and effective immunotherapy. For example, we recently constructed SP-based nanoadjuvant-possessing NIR-II photothermal properties for cancer immunotherapy [61].",

When combined with radiation, polymer therapy led to a statistically significant lower tumor weight compared to the radiation alone group and the control group [55]. Based on above data, the PCL/PLCL scaffold was later tested for anti-tumor efficacy of DC-CCL21 therapy. In order to improve DC culture condition for immunotherapy, a thin layer of fibrin hydrogel with 10 6 DCs seated inside was added to the surface of PCL/PLCL polymer [56]. The component of hydrogel and polymer was optimized for the maximum production of bioactive CCL21. After implantation to the partially resected tumor, the gradient of local CCL21 that resulted from its sustained and localized release led to the recruitment of CD4+ T cells and CD11c+ DCs into the tumor, while tumor infiltrating Treg cells were decreased. Overall, DC-CCL21 polymer treatment significantly reduced tumor burden, compared to control DC group or recombinant CCL21 injection group [56]. Currently, anti-tumor efficacy of polymer loaded with recombinant CCL21 is being further evaluated with combination of cisplatin chemotherapy and radiation therapy. \n\nIn addition to cytokines and immune cells, tumor associated antigen can also be loaded in polymer to activate DCs. Subcutaneous implantation of PLG polymer loaded with cytokine GM-SCF, TLR agonist CpG and tumor lysate as antigen led to host DC recruitment, activation and subsequent homing to lymph nodes [58]. This vaccine induced 90% prophylactic tumor protection and therapeutic protection. The polymer scaffold also displayed long term activity for months post implantation, which is superior to all soluble administration methods to date [58]. \n\nOther biomaterials, such as vault nanoparticles, were also investigated for intratumoral CCL21 delivery. In a well characterized Lewis lung cancer model, CCL21-vault nanoparticles system showed effective anti-tumor efficacy.",

            "text": "There were several attempts to construct PLNPs using organic materials with efficient afterglow luminescence. Pu's group reported semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) with red-shifted and enhanced NIR afterglow luminescence at 780 nm [20]. SPNs were prepared by nanoprecipitation of diverse semiconducting polymers(SPs) and PEG-b-PPG-b-PEG triblock copolymers (Fig. 5a). Among several SPs, phenylenevinylene(PPV)-based SPNs showed afterglow luminescence, since singlet oxygen generated by irradiation oxidized vinylene bonds of PPV, leading to unstable PPV-dioxetane intermediate emitting afterglow luminescence. In addition, for amplification and red-shift of afterglow luminescence, they doped a 1 O 2 sensitizer, silicon 2,3-naphthalocyanine bis(trihexylsilyloxide) (NCBS), into SPN-MEHPPV with the most intensive afterglow luminescence among PPVbased SPNs. SPN-NCBS showed amplified NIR afterglow emission at 780 nm. An 11-fold increase in afterglow luminescence was observed after pre-irradiation at 808 versus 514 nm. Based on these results, SPN-NCBS revealed a magnificent signal-to-background ratio (SBR) of 291, which is 67 times larger than that of NIR fluorescence in the detection of NIR signals through 1.5 cm thick chicken tissue. In addition, SPN-NCBS was effectively accumulated into lymph nodes and tumors in vivo and showed efficient afterglow luminescence only after 2 hours with a significant SBR of 149.7 in the tumor, 23.3fold higher than that of NIR fluorescence. The surface of SPN-NCBS was also modified with amphiphilic oligomer with quencher (C 18 PEG 12 -DNBS), resulting in selective cleavage in the presence of biothiols including cysteine and glutathione.",

Particles (as needed for imaging)  are prepared by either emulsion polymerization or nanoprecipitation. 46 Doping with fluorophores is not needed. The backbone of conjugated polymers behaves like an array of lightharvesting units that exhibit a larger optical cross section compared to small organic molecule dyes. Photobleaching was not reported so far. Fine-tuning of the conjugated polymer structure and the polymeric encapsulation matrix leads to fluorescent probes with specific spectral properties and targeting capability. P-dots display strong fluorescence that often extends far into the NIR, are highly inert and do not swell in water. Little is known about biocompatibility, internalization, and excretion from tissues. Their uses in imaging and therapy have been reviewed. 47 luorescent nanodots consisting of semiconducting polymer blends can be attached to peptides (such as chlorotoxin) 48 and then can be used for targeted imaging (of malignant brain tumors, for example) in clinical diagnosis. By coupling the pH-indicator fluorescein to P-dots, a material is obtained that displays two fluorescence peaks, one being pH sensitive, the other not so that it can acts as an internal reference. Fully reversible pH sensing was demonstrated 49 for the pH 5.0 to 8.0 range. Intracellular pH values were determined by imaging of HeLa cells following the uptake of the P-dots by endocytosis. Tetraphenylethene-based fluorescent organic NPs undergo aggregation-induced emission inside cells and this was monitored via cell imaging. 50 The fluorescence of conjugated polymers, particularly if anionic, can be quenched by ions such as Cu(II). 51 emiconducting P-dots (20 to 50 nm) can also serve as photoacoustic probes for real-time imaging of reactive oxygen species in living mice tissue where they accumulate quite readily. 52",

Next-generation biomaterials are being engineered to create sophisticated drug delivery systems that allow for more accurate targeting of tumor sites, while controlling the release of therapeutic agents in response to environmental cues. For example, biodegradable polymers and hydrogels are being designed to respond to changes in the TME, such as pH or temperature, enabling the more precise delivery of immunotherapies [94]. Engineered nanoparticles and microparticles are being tailored to encapsulate immunotherapeutic agents, reducing systemic toxicity by delivering drugs directly to the tumor site, thereby improving therapeutic outcomes. A recent study demonstrated that nanoparticle-based biomaterial scaffolds achieved a 50% improvement in drug retention at tumor sites compared to the results for traditional delivery systems, significantly reducing off-target effects [95]. \n\nAdditionally, biomaterial-based scaffolds and implants are being explored for localized, sustained release of immuno-modulatory agents. These materials can act as platforms for long-term immune activation, where immunotherapies are delivered continuously to the tumor environment, enhancing immune system engagement while minimizing systemic exposure. For instance, hydrogel-based implants designed for the localized delivery of interleukin-2 have shown promising results in boosting immune responses, with fewer side effects than those for systemic administration [94]. Such advancements are key to overcoming current limitations in immunotherapy delivery and enhancing both treatment efficacy and patient safety.",

This is achieved by using a slide coated with epitope-imprinted gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) as a capture substrate to recognize the peptide epitope and Raman-active silver nanoparticles imprinted with glycans as nanotags to recognize the glycans. This method facilitated the detection of CEA concentration in serum samples, allowing discrimination between colon cancer patients and healthy individuals. Speed, stability, fewer sample requirements, and cost-effectiveness were benefits of this approach. The printing techniques used exhibit wide applicability, allowing their extension to a wide range of glycoproteins, in addition to promoting the use of MIPs in the surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) technique, which is known for being highly sensitive and non-destructive. \n\nOn the other hand, Piloto et al. [110] investigated the integration of cellulose-based hydrogel, quantum dots, and molecularly imprinted polymers in their study. The hydrogel functions as a support matrix, while the quantum dots serve as fluorescent markers for signal production and identification of the CA19-9 protein biomarker, which is linked to pancreatic cancer (PC). The proposed approach involves the use of MIPs as biorecognition elements, which are coupled with cadmium telluride (CdTe) quantum dots and semiconductor nanocrystals that serve as optical detection probes for the target analyte. The polymerization strategy employed is surface imprinting, which allows greater control over the growth of the polymer around the template molecule compared to traditional bulk polymerization methods. The HEC: MIP@QDs hydrogel sensor that was printed has demonstrated favorable characteristics such as a low detection limit, exceptional selectivity, reliable reproducibility, and stability, resulting in an optical diagnostic method capable of detecting CA19-9 in patients with pancreatic cancer. By integrating QDs into the MIP matrix, a simple approach to combining binding and reading functionalities is provided. This is achieved by the observable quenching of QDs upon interaction with target proteins.",

            "text": "With increases in human life expectancy, the incidence of tumors is increasing, and it has a major impact on public health worldwide (GBD, 2015Risk Factors Collaborators, 2016). Malignant tumors deserve more attention than benign tumors in terms of the damage they cause and the medical costs they incur. The early detection of tumor especially premalignant lesions has led to higher cure rates, increased life expectancy, and lower medical costs. However, continued growth and metastasis of the tumor leads to a decline in the abovementioned benefits of detection. Until oncology drugs with high efficacies and lower side effects have been discovered, early detection and diagnosis of tumor especially premalignant is the most effective way to reduce mortality and prolong survival (Etzioni et al., 2003). \n\nTraditional imaging and tissue biopsy techniques are the most widely used detection methods. However, in the early stages of tumor development, the information obtained from small samples is insufficient to diagnose tumors. Moreover, these detection methods have limited specificity for different tumors. Thus, multiple tests with considerable time costs are required for tumor diagnosis. Therefore, the widespread screening of healthy individuals is difficult. High financial costs associated with tumor diagnosis significantly burden public health (Figure 1). New methods for the early detection of solid tumors are urgently required to ease the burden on public health. With recent developments in genetics and proteomics, low-cost, more generalized, easy-to-use, low-injury, more sensitive, and specific solid tumor early detection methods are gradually becoming available. In this study, we reviewed the progress of research on tumor-based early detection methods.",

            "text": "Once taken up by cancer cells, 5-ALA releases from lysosome due to the wakened attraction intensity between chitosan and 5-ALA, which strengthens the accumulation of PpIX fluorescence and facilitates the PDD of cancer cells (Yang et al., 2013). Numerous research have indicated the great prospect of the folic acid-based polymeric nanoagents for diagnosing cancer by delivering 5-ALA, such as oral cancer (Yang et al., 2013), cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) (Xu et al., 2021), prostate cancer (Casas, 2020) and glioblastoma (Babic et al., 2018). \n\nSemiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) are also identified as excellent optical agents and applied for fluorescence, chemiluminescent, and photoacoustic (PA) imaging for the early detection of cancer due to the excellent biocompatibility and structural versatility (Cui et al., 2020;Tang et al., 2022). Poly (p-phenylenevinylene) (PPV)-based SPNs could emit afterglow luminescence after removing light excitation. Hence, the tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP) photosensitizer-copolymerized PPVs SPNs are synthesized to function as near-infrared (NIR) afterglow nanoagents. The novel copolymer nanoagents produce red-shifted NIR luminescence and amplified afterglow signals, allowing the in vivo tiny cancer imaging via sensing low oxygen in the cancer microenvironment (Cui et al., 2018). In general, cancer-associated fibroblasts are recognized as the key barriers for cancer therapy. Thereby, activated fibroblasts (AF)-camouflaged SPNs (AF-SPNs) are emerged as effective biomimetic nanoagents for optimizing cancer phototheranostics, where a SPN and AF membrane serve as the core and shell, respectively (Li et al., 2018). The AF-SPNs would generate stronger PA signal and dramatically strengthen photodiagnostic efficacy (Li et al., 2018).",

It allows rapid and sensitive detection of cancer-related molecules and changes even when they occur in only in a small percentage of cells. It has the potential to generate entirely novel and highly effective therapeutic agents. It offers several important benefits such as the development of new contrast agents for the earlier and more accurate detection of cancer and the continual monitoring of cancer patient treatment. Nanoparticles offer several clinical advantages. They circulate throughout the bloodstream without being attacked by the immune system; they preferentially bind to cancerous areas allowing them to deliver and release their drug payloads specifically there; and they are non-toxic as the platelet membranes are nano particle cores made of a biodegradable polymer that can be safely metabolized by the body; and they can be packed with many small drug molecules that diffuse out of the polymer core and through the platelet membrane onto their targets. They are also able to detect faint early cancer traces. \n\nIn contrast with conventional therapies, which risk damage to normal tissues or incomplete eradication of the cancer, nanotechnology offers the means to target chemotherapies directly and selectively to cancerous cells and neoplasms. It can guide in the surgical resection of tumors. It can also enhance the therapeutic efficacy of radiation-based and other treatment modalities, all of which can add up to a decreased risk to the patient and an increased probability of survival. \n\nThe unique characteristics of nanoparticles make them highly attractive for various applications in oncology. They are able to function as carriers for chemotherapeutic drugs to increase their therapeutic index and lower their toxicity. They can act as therapeutic agents in photodynamic, gene, and thermal therapy. They also provide imaging agents to detect and monitor cancer progression. Importantly, a variety of miniaturized drug delivery systems have been developed some of which for delivery across the brain protective barriers. \n\nNotwithstanding the general belief that nanoparticles are non-toxic, it remains that their bio distribution is still imperfect due to the complex host's reactions to nano-and micro-sized materials, and also due to the difficulty in targeting specific organs in the body.",

            "text": "Therefore, QDs composed of less toxic semiconducting nanocrystals (e.g., indium phosphide and silicon) have attracted considerable attention as bright and biocompatible probes for fluorescence bioimaging [98]. In addition to lowtoxicity QDs, polymer dots based on conjugated semiconducting polymers have been investigated as alternative fluorescent probes without considering the cytotoxicity caused by ionized heavy metals [99]. \n\nThese imaging modalities have various advantages and disadvantages. For instance, MRI, CT, and PET have high penetration depths, however, their spatial resolution is limited to the millimeter scale. In contrast, fluorescent imaging has high spatial resolution at the subcellular scale, however, its penetration depth is limited to a few centimeters. To benefit from each advantage, multimodal imaging has generated considerable research interest in increasing the accuracy of diagnosis using complementary information from different imaging modalities [100]. The fabrication of nanoparticulated imaging probes allows them to exhibit multifunctional characteristics; therefore, the strength of each imaging modality can be integrated into a multimodal nanoparticle. For instance, 64 Cu-labelled and RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) peptide-conjugated iron oxide nanoparticles were developed as PET/MR dual-modality imaging probes for tumor integrin expression, whereas the near-infrared fluorescent (NIRF) dye ZW800 loaded with silica nanoparticles labelled with Gd ions and 64 Cu was developed as PET/MR/optical imaging probe for tumor-draining sentinel lymph nodes [100]. In addition to diagnostic imaging, these multifunctional nanoparticles can also serve to monitor therapeutic efficacy of cancer treatment (theranostics) [101]. For example, croconaine dye-based nanoparticles were developed for photoacoustic/fluorescent imaging-guided photothermal therapy [102], while SPIO and olaparib-loaded exosome extracted from hypoxic cells was investigated for magnetic particle imaging and therapy of hypoxic region in tumor [103].",

Semiconducting polymer-based nanoparticles can be used for molecular imaging, phototherapy, and photoregulation because of their good biocompatibility and unique optical property (Jiang and Pu, 2018). Such SPN II R with a core-shell structure contained three main components: a semiconducting polymer nanoparticle core as the NIR-II photothermal converter, a toll-like receptor (TLR) agonist (R848) as the immunotherapeutic adjuvant, and a thermally responsive lipid shell on the nanoparticle surface. The thermally responsive lipid shell was constructed using 1,2dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC), a thermal phospholipid with a phase-transition temperature of 41 \u00b0C, and an amphiphilic polymer, 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3phosphoethanolamine-poly(ethylene glycol) (DSPE-PEG), and could be melted after a photothermal effect. SPN II R exhibited an effective accumulation into tumors after systemic administration, which may be due to their small size and surface PEG corona. Upon NIR-II photoactivation at 1,064 nm, SPN II R produced heat to induce tumor cell death and immunogenic cell death (ICD). Meanwhile, the generated heat could melt thermally responsive lipid shell for controlled release of R848 to active TLR7/TLR8, thereby promoting the maturation of DCs and priming of antitumor T cells. Via the synergetic action of NIR-II PTT and immunotherapy, the growth of both primary and distant tumors and lung metastasis in a 4T1 tumor-bearing BALB/c mouse model was effectively suppressed after a single treatment.",

Indeed, many bioelectronic applications, mentioned throughout, do not rely on high OECT performance to function and instead are reliant on factors such as mobility, swelling, and stability to name but a few. Furthermore, publications released prior to the aforementioned benchmarking paper tended to not report a [\u03bcC*] value, which limits the comparison of some materials. Despite these noteworthy points, the following sections will utilize [\u03bcC*] as the main figure of merit for comparing the OECT performance of various OMIECs, discussing other metrics (stability, transconductance, synthetic novelty etc.) where appropriate.\n\n2.5.4. Glycolated Polythiophene Derivatives. The emergent and exciting class of glycolated semiconducting materials has dominated the field of OECT channel materials over recent years. These glycol chain decorated semiconducting polymers mirror previous conjugated polyelectrolyte materials in that the electronic charge transport occurs along the \u03c0-conjugated backbone while ion transport is facilitated by the hydrophilic glycol side chains. The addition of polar glycol side chains has been shown to alter morphology, microstructure, and optoelectronic properties of resultant semiconducting polymers. 173,201,202 In 2016, the first reported glycolated semiconducting polymers for OECTs were published, reporting polymers containing either a glycolated benzodithiophene or bithiophene backbone unit. 159 These motifs were chosen to allow the oxygen atom of the ethylene glycol chain to be directly attached to the conjugated backbone, facilitating the electron donating nature of the oxygen and affording highly planar polymer backbones, mimicking the beneficial structural properties of PEDOT:PSS. These glycolated monomers were subjected to Stille homo-or copolymerization with either thiophene (T) or bithiophene (namely 2T or T2) monomers to produce five unique polymers: g2T-T, gBDT, gBDT-2T, gBDT-T, and gBDT-g2T ( Figure 21).

Many methods were considered for electrode coating and the conversion of thiophene to different monomers to improve their functions and to use them for a new generation of novel medical usages. It is believed that polythiophenes and their derivatives can be used in the future as a substitute for many old-fashioned ways of creating chemical biosensors polymeric materials and also drugs with lower side effects yet having a more effective response.

            "text": "The burgeoning area of proteomics has created an increasing demand for new materials which can effectively serve as active and/or passive components in various protein detection methods. Essential and crucial information such as evaluating protein levels, determining protein structure, assessing reaction dynamics and mechanisms of protein interactions, screening for the presence or absence of specific proteins, and analyzing protein activity can be obtained through protein detection methods. Therefore, improvements in current protein detection techniques are continuously being made in order to enable accurate and sensitive measurements. In addition, innovative detection systems involving novel materials are being developed to accomplish miniaturization, high throughput, and high sensitivity of protein assays. Such efforts come from many different research fields in the life sciences, physical sciences, engineering disciplines, as well as medical sciences. Possible applications of newly developed materials for improved protein detection can generally be placed into two categories. The first entails creating new materials for use as sensing (active) components, in which case specifically designed properties of the materials are actively involved in detecting signal production or transduction. Increasing sensitivity and selectivity of intended measurements are often the goal of research efforts related to this category. The second category pertains to the application of new materials as non-sensing (passive) components in protein measurements. Increasing biocompatibility and biostability, while concomitantly extending the lifetime of protein detection devices through resisting biofouling, are the goals of research endeavors in this category. For meeting such goals, crucial criteria for effective biodetection should be considered in the research and development process of new protein measurement systems, regardless of the material chosen and detection mechanisms. Ideal sensor materials should be easily and inexpensively produced in large quantities. They should also exhibit physical, optical, or electrical properties that improve the detected signal in comparison to those of conventional sensor materials. Ideal protein detection systems should not only facilitate qualitative but also quantitative measurements rapidly, accurately, and straightforwardly. They should be also capable of delivering efficient, parallel, and automated analyses that can be applied to large numbers of samples with reduced sample volume and reagent usage. \n\nPolymers play an important role as one of the preferred materials to mediate various biologically essential constituents such as DNA, proteins, small molecules, and cells [1][2][3][4][5][6][7].",

Their biologically relevant mechanical characteristics, ability to be chemically modified, and mixed electronic and ionic charge transport are captured within the diverse field of organic bioelectronics. Conjugated polymers are used in a wide range of device architectures, and cell and tissue scaffolds. These devices enable biosensing of many biomolecules, such as metabolites, nucleic acids, and more. Devices can be used to both stimulate and sense the behavior of cells and tissues. Similarly, tissue interfaces permit interaction with complex organs, aiding both fundamental biological understanding and providing new opportunities for stimulating regenerative behaviors and bioelectronic based therapeutics. Applications of these materials are broad, and much continues to be uncovered about their fundamental properties. This report covers the current understanding of the fundamentals of conjugated polymer biointerfaces and their interactions with biomolecules, cells, and tissues in the human body. An overview of current materials and devices is presented, along with highlighted major in vivo and in vitro applications. Finally, open research questions and opportunities are discussed.",

            "text": "However, these developments are limited in their ability to detect molecules such as proteins and in physiological conditions and complex biofluids. To overcome limitations associated with one-to-one recognition elements, we are investigating the development of a perception-based methodology that uses ML processes coupled with a sensor array, where each element exhibits moderate selectivity for a wide range of molecules. \n\nThe prognosis and quality of life of patients with cancer are strongly affected by the ability to accurately diagnose diseases at an early stage. One such example is ovarian cancer, the fifth leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women in the United States and first among gynecologic malignancies (24), with 22,000 new cases and 14,000 deaths per year (24). The 5-year relative survival rate for patients diagnosed with ovarian cancer is 44% (25), while detection at stage I can increase the 5-year survival rate to more than 90% (26). However, there are no methods to date that achieve early, accurate diagnoses or are there strategies to rapidly determine patient response to treatment to inform the choice of therapy. \n\nTo detect gynecologic cancers, such as high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (27)(28)(29) and endometrial cancers (30,31), U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved serum biomarkers such as cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) and human epididymis protein 4 (HE4) have been used as well as ultrasonography. However, these methods lack the sensitivity to detect early-stage cancer and have had little impact on survival (32,33). A recent study of uterine lavage (or uterine washings, fluids removed from the uterus after perfusion with saline) found substantially higher levels of biomarkers, such as HE4, CA-125, chitinase-3-like protein 1 (YKL-40), and mesothelin, than those found in serum (34). Therefore, the use of uterine lavage has the potential to improve early detection. \n\nSingle-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) have unique optical properties and sensitivity that make them valuable as sensor materials (35).",

            "text": "This suggestion is supported by an evaluation of priorities in cancer research directed to solve problems in LMICs, where primary prevention strategies, early and constant screening for cancer control, and adoption of technologies such as point-of-care diagnostics (lab-on-a-chip), telemedicine, image analysis, and pattern recognition for pathologies must be implemented in public health services [12,13]. With respect to cancer biomarkers research, it has been found that lung cancer, biliary tract cancer, breast and bladder cancers, oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), and other epithelial tumors can express a common biomarker known as CYFRA 21-1, related to the cytokeratin 19 fragment expressed in cytoskeleton filaments from epithelial cells [14][15][16][17]. CYFRA 21-1 can serve as a biomarker for cancer prediction perceptible in blood samples [17], saliva, and serum in patients with OSCC at minimum concentrations [18,19], and it is usually detected by biochemical quantification in plasma samples, immunoassays, and other hybridization methods [20]. However, emerging alternatives consider the design of electrochemical, photoelectrochemical, or optical biosensors that can contribute to cancer diagnosis, improving their sensitivity using nanomaterials [21]. Biosensing platforms for cancer biomarker detection are mainly fabricated of gold, graphene, metal-oxide semiconductors, carbon nanotubes, indium tin oxide, glasscarbon and other composites, which offer improved sensitivity within the order of \u03bcg ml \u22121 to pg ml \u22121 . In particular, electrochemical biosensors generally use a combination of materials such as AuNPs, Si 3 N 4 /MoS 2 , Au electrode, SnS 2 /SnS/Bi 2 S 3 , and ZnCdS@ NPC-ZnO for the fabrication of electrodes, coatings, and coupling materials for enhancing output signal responses [22,23]; however, this could unbalance the final cost of biosensor devices.",

            "text": "Many conducting polymers have been developed and used in the fabrication of electrochemical sensors. The recent work gives an insight into the more promising approaches that are currently available. Conductive polymers offer significant chemical versatility, including a variety of backbone compositions with distinct electrochemical behavior that can be addressed through a range of techniques including potentiometry, amperometry, conductometry, and voltammetry. Also, conductive polymers can include functional groups that enable functionalization with various types of biorecognition molecules. These properties, in addition to their ability to act in conjunction with organic/inorganic materials to provide high sensitivity and selectivity, make them prime substrates for the detection of biological analytes, as described in the examples noted in this review. \n\nThe versatility of conductive polymer biosensors has opened doors to their use in a range of bioanalytical applications including in disposable personal monitoring devices for diagnostic purposes (glucose, fertility, cholesterol, and genetic sensors), point of care diagnostics for clinical use (detection of infectious disease, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer), implantable devices for medical monitoring (neural probes and stimuli-responsive drug delivery systems), and even tissue engineering scaffolds. Their adoption by patients and clinicians could potentially revolutionize current medical practice and the healthcare system by shifting the focus from traditional off-site laboratory analysis to on-the-spot detection and quantification. In addition, the adoption of conductive polymer-based biosensors by the healthcare system could be significant for the early detection of serious diseases such as cancer through biomarker-based screening. Similarly, rapid biomarker detection could be critical for proper selection of personalized treatment options that are suitable for the molecular fingerprint of the patient's disease (i.e., personalized medicine), as well as for monitoring treatment effectiveness and disease recurrence during and after treatment. \n\nWhile advances have been made in the use of conducting polymers for the fabrication of highly sensitive biosensors, one problem that needs to be explored is the long-term stability of these sensors. Current and future work includes sensor miniaturization and multiplexing to enable the development of lab-on-a-chip devices, portable, and even wearable multiplex sensors that can monitor multiple analytes.",

This biosensor exhibited detection limits of 5 mu/mL and 0.02524 \u03bcg/mL for alphafetoprotein and glutamine transferase isozyme II, respectively [57]. In 2018, Liu et al. developed a bow-tie THz metamaterial biosensor coated with an antibody for the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is a biomarker for gastrointestinal cancer, breast cancer, head-and-neck cancer, and epithelial cancer. This biosensor exhibited a detection limit of 10 fmol/mL [58]. In 2020, Weisenstein et al. designed a metamaterial biosensor combined with complementary DNA strands that bind specifically to single-stranded oligo-or poly-nucleotide probe molecules. This biosensor was used for the detection of a human tumor marker, melanoma inhibitory activity (MIA) mRNA, with a detection limit of 1:55 \u00d7 10 \u221212 mol/L [59].\n\nThese proposed auxiliary methods all succeeded in enhancing the spectral SNR. Contrast agents, optical cleaning agents, antibodies, and metamaterials can specifically elevate or eliminate the signals of certain substances, thus enhancing the final spectral SNR. However, sample contamination with additional substances is unavoidable. Furthermore, substances for in vivo use must not cause harm to the human body. Antibodies and metamaterials can be used in combination to enhance the detection sensitivity and identify biomarkers in low concentrations. However, the process of searching for antibodies is not easy, and there are no antibodies available for some cancer biomarkers.",

            "text": "The most widely researched and investigated disease, both medically and scientifically, in the current era is the formidable disease cancer. The chances of successful treatment and hence the curability increases if it is diagnosed at an early stage. This can be done only by increasing awareness amongst people about its early diagnosis and screening tests. Cancer screening exams refers to the medical tests to identify people who have disease, often before symptoms of the illness occur. These tests help detecting cancer at its earliest stage when the chances for curing the disease are greatest. Advancements in nanotechnology have made the early screening of cancer possible. In this review, we have discussed the developments in nanotechnology that have encouraged the more recent innovative solutions for early diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Quantum dots, nanometer-sized semiconductors, are the new class of novel biosensors, now being exclusively employed as alternative fluorescent probes due to their unique properties, such as intense and stable fluorescence for a longer time, resistance to photobleaching, large molar extinction coefficients, and highly sensitive detection, due to their ability to absorb and emit light very efficiently. Their size approximates that of individual biomolecules, which offers unique possibilities for the ultrasensitive detection of cancer in persons\u2019 serum, tissues, and other body fluids, when tagged with specific antibodies against specific tumor markers. In this review, we have account briefly the applications of semiconductor QDs employed for the early screening and diagnosis of cancer biomarkers between the years 2009-2012. We believe that this review will enable workers in the field to devise new applications of these materials for the early detection of cancer, and ultimate reduction in incidence of the disease.

            "text": "IL-6 is an inflammatory cytokine with hematopoietic and immunomodulatory functions; although not a specific biomarker of CRC, IL-6 is closely associated with CRC occurrence, development, staging, invasion, and metastasis. \n\nTertis et al. constructed an electrochemical aptasensor to sensitively detect IL-6 in human serum by depositing a nanocomposite consisting of PPy nanoparticles (PPyNPs) and AuNPs onto SPCE (Figure 13A) [151]. Both the PPyNPs and AuNPs coexisted on the electrode surface, providing an appropriate environment for immobilization of IL-6 aptamers. Moreover, conjugated polypyrrole polymer-containing epoxy side group (PPCE) is a novel conjugated polymer polymerized by the Py monomer that contains an epoxy active side group. As shown in Figure 13B, Elif Burcu Ayd\u0131n designed an immunosensor using PPCE-modified ITO electrodes [152]. The PPCE polymer formed a large specific surface area on the ITO electrode, making it possible to fix the biomolecular IL-6 receptor, and the sensor had good conductivity, stability, and biocompatibility, which enhanced its sensitivity. \n\nPPyNWs exhibit good electrical characteristics and can enhance the sensitivity of biosensors because of their high specific surface area. Cruz et al. prepared PPyNWs on PEEK and PETE flexible thermoplastics using nanocontact printing technology and controlled chemical technology and then functionalized them with diazo chemistry and a crosslinking agent to immobilize the IL-6 antibody, enabling IL-6 detection with a wide linear range from 1 pg/mL to 50 pg/mL and an LOD of 0.36 pg/mL [154]. \n\nnostic information regarding recurrent CRC.

            "text": "In this study, we conducted electrochemical measurements on the electrodes to track the stepwise alteration of the electrode and the changes in the sensing interface features after modification with GAgNPs. This analyze aimed to determine the concentrations of CA 15-3 and MUC-1 biomarkers in blood serum and tissue homogenate samples, respectively. Figure 5 illustrates the sensitive and selective detection capabilities of the GAgNPs-coated sensor, presenting comparative results from the measurements. For CA 15-3, assessments were conducted on blood serum samples, demonstrating the Ab1/GAgNPs-coated sensor's efficacy in detecting and quantifying biomarker within a biological matrix commonly used in clinical diagnostics. Similarly, the sensor's performance in detecting MUC-1 from tissue homogenates underscores its potential for tissuebased diagnostics, offering valuable insights into the tumor microenvironment. According to the electrochemical results presented in Fig. S1, a noticeable increase in the redox peak current for the biosensor is observed with rising concentrations of biomarkers. As both the tumor grade and biomarker (CA 15-3 and MUC-1) concentrations increase, the Ab1/ GAgNPs-coated sensor redox peaks at higher values. This enhancement can be attributed to the larger active area and higher electronic conductivity of the GAgNPs, which facilitate the accelerated interfacial electron transfer. \n\nThe combination of nanomaterials with electrochemical biosensors offers the potential to at once monitor several cancer signals.

In this review, we provide an overview of biomaterials spanning a wide size range, from the nanoto macro-scale, emphasizing that the size of the biomaterial is the primary determinant of the delivery route. For nanoparticles <200 nm, delivery can be achieved through intravenous administration or local injections (e.g., subcutaneous, intramuscular, or intralesional) depending on the target tissue and the specific properties of the biomaterials, including their stability in the bloodstream. 148 Additionally, alternative routes such as inhalation may be employed to target the lung. Notably, oral delivery is a feasible approach, with potential applications in stimulating gut immunity or enabling absorption through the gut mucosa for systemic drug distribution. Conversely, for biomaterials of larger scales, ranging from micro-to macro-scales, the available delivery options are more limited. These biomaterials are predominantly administered through local injections or implantation, often in intra/peri-tumoral contexts. Notably, oral administration remains a possibility for larger biomaterials. \n\nThe territory of cancer immunotherapy has continuously expanded. As discussed in the current review, the combination of biomaterials and immunotherapy offers promising possibilities for the treatment of tumors. Biomaterial-based combination cancer immunotherapy has also been tested in clinical trials. 149 Multiscale biomaterials are used to activate antitumor immunity, including but not limited to polymers, nanoparticles, and hydrogels. The materials have been used to cross-link immune cell surface receptors for immune activation. In contrast to immunotherapeutic delivery strategies, the covalent linkage of biomolecules to biomaterials enables the interaction between materials and immune cell surface receptors, mimicking the multivalent cell-to-cell or cell-to-pathogen interactions. These approaches are highly tunable. For example, increasing the aspect ratio of nanoparticles increased the contact area between materials and cells. 68 Semi-flexible rather than rigid biomaterials enabled efficient clustering of immune cell surface receptors. 30",

            "text": "Background The overall survival rate of osteosarcoma (OS) patients has not been improved for 30\u2009years, and the diagnosis and treatment of OS is still a critical issue. To improve OS treatment and prognosis, novel kinds of theranostic modalities are required. Molecular optical imaging and phototherapy, including photothermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT), are promising strategies for cancer theranostics that exhibit high imaging sensitivity as well as favorable therapeutic efficacy with minimal side effect. In this study, semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPN-PT) for OS-targeted PTT/PDT are designed and prepared, using a semiconducting polymer (PCPDTBT), providing fluorescent emission in the second near-infrared window (NIR-II, 1000 - 1700\u2009nm) and photoacoustic (PA) signal in the first near-infrared window (NIR-I, 650 - 900\u2009nm), served as the photosensitizer, and a polyethylene glycolylated (PEGylated) peptide PT, providing targeting ability to OS. Results The results showed that SPN-PT nanoparticles significantly accelerated OS-specific cellular uptake and enhanced therapeutic efficiency of PTT and PDT effects in OS cell lines and xenograft mouse models. SPN-PT carried out significant anti-tumor activities against OS both in vitro and in vivo. Conclusions Peptide-based semiconducting polymer nanoparticles permit efficient NIR-II fluorescence/NIR-I PA dual-modal imaging and targeted PTT/PDT for OS. Graphic Abstract",

            "text": "The data suggested that Ppa nanomodules were conducive to preoperative photoacoustic localization and intraoperative continuous AL imaging of tumors to guide resection (Fig. 4D). Light-triggered functional conversion from photoacoustic imaging to continuous AL imaging was achieved in two tumor models of murine breast cancer and peritoneal cancer in situ (Fig. 4E). As a marker of neutrophil infiltration and immunogenic cell death, ONOO \u00c0 detection by Ppa-FFGYSA nanomodules holds promise for clinical translational prospects of AL-assisted imaging. \n\nThe ultra-sensitive prospects of AL for in vivo imaging are limited by its dependence on inorganic carrier nanoparticles with difficult to modify surfaces, which may contribute to short NIR emission lifespan and relative dampening of signal contrast in target tissues [72][73][74]. A series of works by the Pu lab sought to address these issues using organic AL nanoconstructs. In 2017, the group fabricated organic <40 nm optically active semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) that demonstrated emission detection peaks at 780 nm that penetrated through living mouse tissue and had an emission half-life of about 6-7 min [75]. Dioxetane formation was intrinsically determined by substituent groups of the phenylenevinylene (PPV) polymer's vinyl bonds, and the PPV-SPNs could generate the necessary reactive 1 O 2 for AL emission following light irradiation. Incorporation of NIR-absorbing 1 O 2 sensitizer, NCBS5, facilitated recharged AL in deep tissue for longitudinal in vivo imaging. Thus, SPN-NCBS5 permitted rapid and highly sensitive lymph node and tumor imaging. Furthermore, by taking advantage of the structural versatility of SPNs, the authors developed smart biothiol-activatable NIR-AL probes (SPN-thiol) that could be activated by endogenous antioxidant biothiols present shortly after drug challenge in drug-induced hepatotoxicity. The SPN-thiols produced a SBR level that was 25-fold greater than NIR fluorescence (Fig. 5A).",

            "text": "The development of novel applications for brain tumors diagnosis and treatment has received the attention from scientists due to their high prevalence. Intracranial metastases from systemic cancers, meningiomas, and gliomas are the most common and they require complex multidisciplinary care, including neurosurgery, radiation oncology, and medical oncology [36]. \n\nThe use of different types of nanoparticles for the detection of brain tumors through various bioimaging techniques has been reported. Hence, studies report the use of iron oxide nanoparticles functionalized with phosphonate polyethylene glycol and covalently coupled to the cyclo RGD peptide sequence as magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents due to their magnetic properties [37]. Furthermore, by coating the iron oxide nanoparticles with bovine serum albumin, conjugating the tumor-specific ligand folic acid onto them, and labeling with fluorescein isothiocyanate, an enhanced intracellular dual-modal imaging, specifically the magnetic resonance imaging and intracellular visualization, for brain tumors can be obtained [38]. Alternatively, multilayered semiconducting polymer nanoparticles containing a hydrophobic semiconducting polymer that was coated with an optically inner silica shell have been synthetized for brain tumors imaging using both fluorescence and photoacoustic brightness [39]. \n\nDrug encapsulated nanoparticles are usually polymeric, especially due to their favorable biodegradability. Studies reported the use of liposomes as vehicles for the delivery of anti-cancer drugs, including doxorubicin and erlotinib [40,41]. The results showed a considerably higher translocation across the blood brain barrier, both for in vitro brain tumor models [40] and for numerical simulations using a three-dimensional brain tumor model reconstructed from magnetic resonance images [41].",

            "text": " Conventional SDT faces several challenges due to the properties of current sonosensitizers including inherent hydrophobicity, tendency to aggregate, and poor pharmacokinetics. [191] However, recent advancements in nanotechnology have revolutionized SDT by utilizing sonosensitizerconjugated nanoparticles for selective tumor eradication. [192,193] his strategy addresses the limitations of traditional SDT by providing advantages, such as enhanced tissue penetration, and improved tumor targeting capacity. [194] ased on the advancement of SDT, Wang et al. recently designed a semiconducting polymer nano-PROTAC (SPN FeP , 72). [195] SPN FeP was synthesized through a self-assemble nanoprecipitation process by integrating a sonodynamic semiconducting polymer, a ferroptosis inducer (ferrocene), a ROScleavable amphiphilic polymer, and a nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase (NAMPT) PROTAC. Upon ultrasound irradiation to the tumor, the semiconducting polymer works as a sonosensitizer to generate singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ), while the ferroptosis inducer reacts with intratumoral hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) to produce hydroxyl radicals ( * OH). This dual-ROS generating programmable process cleaves the ROS-cleavable polymer and induces the release of NAMPT PROTAC within the tumor. This spatiotemporal control of NAMPT degradation leads to an effective suppression of tumor infiltration of myeloidderived suppressive cells, which enhances antitumor immunity. The ultrasound nanoplatform enables precise regulation of PROTAC release through a dual-programmable activation mechanism, thereby increasing antitumor efficacy in deeptissue tumors.",

            "text": "Molecular imaging plays a crucial role in the understanding of biology, the implementation of early diagnosis and treatment of life-threatening diseases. 1-3 Among numerous imaging agents, nanoparticles have recently been investigated and proven to be effective for biomedical imaging because of their multimodal signalling capacity, improved targeting capability via multivalent binding, enhanced permeation and retention for tumor targeting, large payload delivery and tunable biodistribution pro\ue103les. [4][5][6][7][8][9] Along with the numerous opportunities in medicine provided by the convergence of molecular imaging and nanotechnology, new nanoagents with improved properties in terms of biocompatibility and imaging sensitivity are desired so as to facilitate the translation of nanoparticle-related imaging technologies into clinical applications.\n\nSemiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) constitute a new class of optical nanomaterial for molecular imaging. [10][11][12][13][14] Distinct from inorganic nanoparticles such as quantum dots and gold nanoclusters, SPNs are generally made from benign organic ingredients including hydrophobic semiconducting polymers (SPs) and amphiphilic polymer matrices through nanoprecipitation. [15][16][17][18][19] Thereby, SPNs intrinsically circumvent the issue of heavy metal ion-induced toxicity to living organisms and possess good biocompatibility. 20,21 Utilization of SPNs as \ue104uorescent nanoagents has led to a variety of applications including in vitro cell imaging, 15,[22][23][24][25][26][27] in vivo cell tracking, 28 targeted tumor imaging, 14,29-31 ultrafast hemodynamic imaging, 32 and drug toxicity evaluation. 19 In addition, we recently revealed that SPNs can efficiently convert photon energy into heat, permitting sensitive photoacoustic imaging of reactive oxygen species (ROS), 18,19 pH variation 33 and tumors in living animals. 34 We also found that SPNs are generally resistant to ROS and much more photostable than gold nanorods, allowing for reliable imaging and sensing in living animals where ROS are ubiquitous with concentrations up to the micromolar level.

            "text": "The most distinguishable merit of organic/polymer semiconductor devices in biomedical applications is their implantation in a human body without rejection. For example, functionalizing organic semiconductors with amine groups improves biocompatibility because of cationic charging around the amine group [10][11][12][13]. In addition, the biocompatibility of a variety of organic/polymer semiconductors and conductors (such as poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT), 6,13-Bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl)pentacene (TIPS-pentacene), 3,6-bis(5-(benzofuran-2-yl)thiophen-2-yl)-2,5-bis(2-ethylhexyl)pyrrolo [3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (DPP(TBFu) 2 ), and poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)) was evaluated in terms of stability and cell adhesion [14]. All the materials were electrically stable in an aqueous medium with sufficient protection. The cell adhesion ability for each organic semiconductor depends on chemical structure and composition. Although the cell adhesion of organic semiconductors is intrinsically not as good as that of standard culture plastics owing to their hydrophobicity, the cell adhesion property can be improved by surface functionalization with a self-assembled deposition of collagen IV. \n\nAlthough organic/polymer semiconductors are still far from commercialization for high-end electronic devices because of their poorer electrical performance than their inorganic counterparts, research on organic/polymer semiconductors is growing because of their tailorable charge transport characteristics according to their surrounding environment, which means that they have potential for chem/bio sensors and logic devices. Many different types of bioanalytes can be detected by changing the major charge carrier polarity (hole or electron) of organic semiconductors.",

            "text": "Therefore, the use of these sensors for early cancer diagnosis in actual cancer patients still has a long way to go, which is an important consideration for future researchers. Secondarily, the attainment of high specificity and sensitivity in detecting cancer-related tissues and organs through single biomarkers proves to be a complex task, thereby necessitating expeditious research into the physiological mechanisms of biomarkers, the exploration of novel biomarkers, and the integration of multiple biomarkers for clinical detection purposes. In the forthcoming times, scholars must prioritize enhancing the precision and sensitivity of biomarker detection, while concurrently monitoring market and application requirements, and devising compact, versatile, cost-effective, and expeditious platforms for biomarker detection. Thirdly, the current research on the intracellular and extracellular functional mechanisms of MNP sensors is severely insufficient. Hence, it is necessary to study the reaction mechanism of MNPs based on factors such as their chemical composition, size, shape, and synthesis method and apply the obtained rules to designing new biosensors, fully unlocking the potential of MNPs. As a new generation of biomaterials, MNPs offer significant advantages over traditional tumor diagnosis technologies, such as high sensitivity, fast detection, good specificity, and simplicity. Nevertheless, challenges remain in achieving widespread clinical application. First, while MNP-based sensors provide a broad detection range and low limits for tumor markers, the microenvironment of detected markers differs from real-life body fluids, limiting early cancer diagnosis. Second, single biomarker detection is not sufficient, necessitating research on the physiological mechanism of markers, development of new markers, and multimarker clinical testing. In the future, biosensors will need to improve sensitivity and accuracy, address market needs, and develop a miniaturized, multifunctional, economical, and portable platform. Lastly, research on the functional mechanisms of MNP sensors is lacking, requiring the investigation of reaction mechanisms and the development of novel biosensors that maximize MNPs' potential. \n\nCurrently, there are several drawbacks that hinder the further large-scale development of MNPs in the field of tumor biomarker detection, including high cost, limited selectivity, and poor biocompatibility.",

            "text": "Mouse models of ovarian cancer were used for PA imaging. PA imaging is widely used in many preclinical models related to human disease, including breast [8], prostate [143], and ovarian cancer [144]. Notably, these NPs were found to be biodegradable in the presence of cellulose, as observed through electron microscopy and glucose assay. \n\nWith the increase in opportunities for formulating different types of NPs, the field of PA imaging has gained new momentum by utilizing semiconductor NPs. Semiconductor polymer NPs with a self-quenched process were developed by incorporating an electrondeficient unit into the backbone of semiconducting polymers [145]. These NPs were transformed into semiconducting polymer NPs, which amplified PA imaging in live mice by 1.7-fold compared to semiconductor polymer NPs. Furthermore, the delineation of tumors was enhanced by 4.7-fold after systemic administration. \n\nSemiconductor polymer NPs were tested for second near-infrared PA imaging. They proved to be useful for deep-tissue diagnosis due to minimized tissue absorption and reduced light scattering [146]. These organic nano agents consist of a pi-conjugated and oxidizable polymer as a PA signal generator and a hydrolysable polymer as a particle matrix to enhance water solubility. Moreover, these NPs can be cleared via renal excretions and hepatobiliary pathways after systemic administration, thus minimizing potential toxicity to living mice. The nano agents exhibit excellent photothermal conversion efficiency and emit signals at 1064 nm, providing sensitive near-infrared-II PA imaging of deep brain vasculature and subcutaneous tumors at a low systemic dosage. The findings discussed provide valuable insights into semiconductor materials for biophotonic applications, mainly in the near-infrared-II window. \n\nAnother study focused on the synthesis of a broadband-absorbing PA contrast agent based on semiconductor polymer NPs [147]. This contrast agent was applied for PA imaging in the near-infrared-II window and can absorb in both I and II regions, allowing for a comparison of PA imaging at 750 nm and 1064 nm.",

            "text": "Semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (Pdots or SPNs) have recently generated tremendous interests as a novel class of contrast agents for biological imaging [74]. They exhibit several important virtues such as their extraordinary fluorescence brightness, fast emission rate, excellent photostability, and nonblinking and nontoxic features [75][76][77][78][79][80][81]. In particular, we recently developed several influential approaches for introducing functional groups, controlling the surface chemistry of Pdots, and employing these novel nanoparticle probes for cellular labeling and in vivo imaging [82][83][84]. These superior properties of Pdots over other fluorescent probes have established their enormous potential in biology and medicine as highly bright in vitro and in vivo probes. \n\nPu et al. have developed a new class of near-infrared SPN probes for in vivo photoacoustic molecular imaging [24]. SPN can generate stronger signals than SWCNTs or GNRs on a per mass basis, permitting whole-body lymph node photoacoustic mapping in living mice at a low systemic injection mass. Semiconducting polymers have been originally developed for a wide variety of optoelectronic devices. These purely organic SPNs for PAT have a unique set of advantages that derive from the light-harvesting polymers including the large mass extinction coefficients and excellent photostability. These merits make SPNs superior PAT probes for generating strong and photostable photoacoustic signals in the near-infrared region when compared to SWCNT and GNR. At the same mass concentration, the intrinsic photoacoustic amplitude of the SPN at 700 nm can be over five times higher than that from SWCNT or GNR (Figure 5). Such high photoacoustic brightness in combination with its favorable size enables the efficient PAT of major lymph nodes in living mice with high sensitivity after a single intravenous administration of a small amount of SPNs.",

            "text": "Bioelectronics is a field which has seen a massive increase in research investment in recent years [39,97]. Today, this includes a broad range of applications going from medical devices to sensors for the detection of molecules in the context of environmental protection. On the medical device side, numerous patients have seen an improvement in their quality of life thanks to devices such as cardiac pacemakers, cochlear and retinal implants, and glucose sensors. Being now part of our daily life, bioelectronics have received notable attention in the media, due to either science fiction or real-life research advances [39,98]. \n\nThe general organic electronics field has received great attention for bio-applications because of its material versatility, whereby their mechanical, chemical, and physical properties can be precisely controlled and modified to suit specific applications [99]. In particular, two properties have promoted the rise of the organic bioelectronics field: the biocompatibility of these \"soft\" materials in comparison to their inorganic counterparts and their mixed conduction ability (ion and electronic mobility). The reported performance of OECTs has considerably improved in recent times, and they have already supplanted the biosensing capabilities of alternative devices (i.e., conductive-polymer-coated electrodes or thin-film transistors) [10,79,92]. Another reason for the increasing research interest in OECTs is due to the intrinsic limitations of alternative methods. For example, high-spatiotemporal-resolution optical methods are hindered by potential heating of the cells' environment coming from photostimulation. In the case of genetic probes, ethical and safety issues may arise, and accurate massive modification is still not possible even if these fields advance in an impressive way [100,101]. \n\nThe first examples of the use of \"classical\" conducting polymers, i.e., polypyrrole (Ppy), presenting a study of a bio-inorganic interface came from Langer's group [102,103]. In the analysis of these interactions, they realized that the conducting polymer state (reduced/more neutral or oxidized) has an important influence on the cells' properties, such as their ability to anchor to the electrode surface or their growth and morphology.",

The potential of bioelectronics for bidirectional interfacing with biology through continuous, label-free monitoring on one side and precise control of biological activity on the other has extended their application scope to in vitro systems. The advent of microfluidics and the considerable advances in reliability and complexity of in vitro models promise to eventually significantly reduce or replace animal studies, currently the gold standard in drug discovery and toxicology testing. Bioelectronics are anticipated to play a major role in this transition offering a much needed technology to push forward the drug discovery paradigm. Organic electronic materials, notably conjugated polymers, having demonstrated technological maturity in fields such as solar cells and light emitting diodes given their outstanding characteristics and versatility in processing, are the obvious route forward for bioelectronics due to their biomimetic nature, among other merits. This review highlights the advances in conjugated polymers for interfacing with biological tissue in vitro, aiming ultimately to develop next generation in vitro systems. We showcase in vitro interfacing across multiple length scales, involving biological models of varying complexity, from cell components to complex 3D cell cultures. The state of the art, the possibilities, and the challenges of conjugated polymers toward clinical translation of in vitro systems are also discussed throughout.",

            "text": "The need for materials that can interface with biological materials is growing as biomedical engineering advances, particularly for applications such as biosensors, medical implants, brain interfaces, and scaffolds for tissue engineering. Due to their superior mechanical qualities, improved biocompatibility, and intrinsic conductivity when compared to traditional metal-based materials, conducting polymers are intriguing alternatives for these applications. These benefits can be further enhanced by functionalizing the conducting polymers, which will provide qualities like better solubility, antifouling behavior, stimuli-responsive switchability, and the capacity to control cell division and growth. Since it was shown that many CPs are biocompatible and may be used to electrically stimulate cells, changing cellular processes, research into employing CPs as biointerfaces has increased significantly. 116,117 Mainly, nerve, bone, and muscle cells\ufffdcells known to respond to electrical stimulation in vivo\ufffdhave been used to investigate electrical stimulation. 118 owever, CPs need to be further functionalized using biomolecules or biocompatible polymers because they do not interact with cells and tissues in an optimal manner. Thus, the development of technologies to functionalize CPs opens up tremendous prospects to generate materials more suited for various biointerface applications. 116 Because of their distinctive electric and optical properties, as well as their polymeric nature and biocompatibility, conducting polymers have drawn a lot of interest as biointerfaces. 119 CPs are appealing candidates for a variety of biomaterials because of their low cost, ease of production, and outstanding biocompatibility, especially in applications that need communication across interfaces. For example, CPs have a wide range of applications as (bio)sensors because of their ability to transduce chemical signals into optical or electronic signals. \n\nProfessor Olle Inganas' 120 contributions to the subject of CPs for monitoring and managing biological activities, as well as his most relevant publications on each issue, are highlighted.",

            "text": "Anomalies of the internal structures, the presence of foreign bodies, and the state of disease condition have been examined to design appropriate therapeutic procedures. As for cancer, there are two components of detection: (i) Screening and (ii) Downstaging, i.e., early diagnosis. Screening refers to testing a healthy individual for the presence of a tumor even before the symptoms, whereas early detection is testing over the appearance of minor symptoms. Early detection of cancer provides a high curable rate with long-term management. For improved information on anatomical and functional activities of the disease condition, nanostructures are being employed, mostly in oncology. Due to the ease of tuning the physical and optical properties, nanoparticles are excellent candidates in the imaging field. Surface functionalized nanoparticles can indisputably distinguish between healthy tissues and abnormal lesions. Present contrast agents (CA) exhibit fast metabolism, and tumor tissue detection is limited due to the spatial resolution that is generated by the hardware of imaging modalities. The distribution is usually non-specific, which in turn affects the resolution of images. Therefore, the CA can be effectively transported to the tumor site through nanocarriers. There are four ways where nanoparticles can help in the imaging field: (i) NPs as CA: optical properties of the nanoparticles such as upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) aids in imaging applications, (ii) NPs as a carrier of CA: to deliver CA with other imaging elements, nanoscaled carrier systems are being used, (iii) NPs to detect biomarkers: detection of biomarkers in certain cancer types are very arduous, while studies found that nano-based biosensors can significantly amplify the signal from tumor area, (iv) NPs to spot circulating tumor cells (CTCs): NPs are found to be a standalone material as a CTC capture device. Rao et al. demonstrated that erythrocyte membranecoated UCNPs surface functionalized with folic acid receptors for specific binding. The in vivo study showed enhanced tumor imaging with negligible systemic toxicity [51]. For highly specific tumor imaging, the same group synthesized UCNPs coated with a cancer cell membrane that was sized about 80 nm.",

Their unique electronic and optical properties, which stem from their wide bandgap characteristics, offer significant advantages for early cancer detection and treatment. Metal QDs have already demonstrated therapeutic potential in early tumor imaging and therapy. However, biological toxicity has led to the development of various non-functionalized QDs, such as carbon QDs (CQDs), graphene QDs (GQDs), black phosphorus QDs (BPQDs) and perovskite quantum dots (PQDs). To meet the diverse needs of clinical cancer treatment, functionalized QDs with an array of modifications (lipid, protein, organic, and inorganic) have been further developed. These advancements combine the unique material properties of QDs with the targeted capabilities of biological therapy to effectively kill tumors through photodynamic therapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and other means. In addition to tumor-specific therapy, the fluorescence quantum yield of QDs has gradually increased with technological progress, enabling their significant application in both in vivo and in vitro imaging. This review delves into the role of QDs in the development and improvement of clinical cancer treatments, emphasizing their wide bandgap semiconductor properties.",

The findings indicate that the MAT is suitable for a wide range of materials, including polymeric, metallic, and natural biomaterials. However, certain challenges remain, particularly regarding the adaptation of the MAT for specific material properties and testing conditions. The need for optimized protocols, including the use of direct contact and eluate methods, as well as dynamic incubation, was emphasized in several studies. Additionally, the choice of biological matrices, such as fresh or cryopreserved blood and monocytic cell lines, plays a crucial role in the sensitivity and reproducibility of the test results. Furthermore, some classes of materials, such as ceramics and calcium phosphates, are lacking evidence and validation for MAT in the literature, demanding further research. In conclusion, while MAT has shown great promise as a reliable method for pyrogen testing in medical devices and biomaterials, continued research and development are essential to address existing gaps and optimize the methodology for broader applications. Ensuring the standardization and validation of MAT will facilitate its adoption and improve the safety and efficacy of innovative medical technologies.",

            "text": "These methods have a limit of detection too high to make them useful for detecting SNOs at their normal biological levels. \n\nField-Effect Transistor (FET) capacitive biosensors can detect trace amounts of specific biochemicals in the complex milieu of biological samples [8]. They work by using an electrical circuit and then measuring the change in capacitance of that circuit as it interacts with the molecule of interest (Fig 1A) [19]. This requires the capacitor in the system to be made functional with some molecule that specifically interacts only with the analyte of interest, and is most often done by employing antibodies against a specific molecule in order to measure the antibody-antigen interaction [20]. In many cases a high quality antibody to the analyte of interest is not available and other chemical means must be used. The functionalized surface of a FET biosensor is coupled to a semiconductor within the capacitor to ensure a change in the net charge of the functionalized surface will cause a significant change in the capacitance of the semiconducting layer beneath it [8]. This allows for the detection of trace molecule in a biological solution, and when semiconducting materials are employed give them a limit of detection determined by the strength of the interaction between the functionalized layer and the analyte. \n\nDopamine is an organic catecholamine, which under oxidizing conditions forms the melanin polymer, polydopamine [23]. Polydopamine forms thin layers on surfaces when it oxidizes and has a number of useful properties including semiconducting properties and a highly reactive surface [24,25]. This surface will attack any free thiol or primary amine in solution with it, covalently bonding them to the polymer surface [21]. We will also present evidence that the polydopamine chemically reacts with SNOs in a manner unique from their parent thiols, allowing us to covalently bond to SNOs in a solution of polydopamine. Chemically bonding additional molecules to a polydopamine surface, significantly changes its conductive properties making a polydopamine layer ideal for both the semiconducting and the functionalization layer of a SNO-biosensor [24].",

            "text": "Bioimaging, tumor therapy and antimicrobial therapy are three important and correlated areas of medical development. Conventional bioimaging commonly utilizes inorganic materials containing Au, 1,2 Ir (III), 3 Fe2O3 4 and other metallic materials as probes, which also has the ability of killing tumors. Although the materials can achieve targeted bioimaging of tumors in the body, they have the shortcomings of low tumor clearance rate and high toxicity, 5 which cannot achieve tumor therapy. Therefore, people turn their attention to organic materials, such as diamond, 6 graphene, 5 carbon dots, 7,8 which, due to their low toxicity, have been investigated extensively. However, current studies have shown that these materials have not yet led to the removal of tumors and bacteria, thereby limiting their application. Zhang et al prepared a carbon dot-embedded epitope imprinted polymer (C-MIP), and achieved targeted bioimaging of EGFR-overexpressing tumors in tumor-bearing mice by the specific recognition ability for the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) of the material. However, C-MIP can only possess the capacity as a drug carrier and lacks the ability to eliminate tumor cells. In contrast, RTP materials possess dual bioimaging capabilities for both tumor and bacteria, 9 as well as dual therapeutic abilities for anti-tumor and antibacterial treatments. 10,11 At the same time, its side effects on the body are comparable to those of other organic materials, and it has a more comprehensive clinical application potential. \n\nRTP materials are a class of materials that can sense, store, analyze, and respond to the surrounding environment or information. 12 Room temperature phosphorescent materials emerged in the 20th century. 4][15] Therefore, there are problems such as difficult detection of phosphorescence and short emission time, 16 which limit application of RTP materials to detection of protein structure and drug concentration by phosphorescence emission. 17",

            "text": "Curing cancer intends to eradicate tumors while preserving healthy cells [5,6]. \n\nA diverse range of organic and nanoparticles made of inorganic material, including photo thermal agents, comprise nonmaterial's that include platinum, gold, and silver carbon-based nonmaterial's, near-infrared dyes, conductive polymers, soluble proteins and peptides, and melanin-like polymers. On the other hand, PTAs with near-infrared absorbance possess downsides such as suboptimal pharmacokinetics, low immunogenicity, elevated toxic effects, and inflammatory side effects. They are also non-biodegradable. Investigating PTAs that exhibit strong clinical translational efficacy and optimize PTT therapeutic efficacy is imperative [7]. \n\nTo solve the problem, scientists are creating biodegradable nonmaterials such as conducting polymers, melanin-like polymers, carbon-based tiny substances, and tiny molecular organic colors. These materials possess inherent biocompatibility and biodegradability, along with established degradation mechanisms and recognized metabolic pathways, making them promising candidates for enhancing the effectiveness of PTT. By leveraging the potential of these biodegradable nonmaterials, researchers aim to prevail over the constraints of recent PTAs and provide the most efficient, effective PTT treatments. \n\nTo ensure that PTAs used in clinical translation are successfully removed from the human body within a given timeframe, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the United States emphasizes this matter. A clear advantage is provided by mechanisms that can stimulate the degradation of nonmaterial's [4]. Despite its considerable effectiveness in clinical therapeutics, PTT has drawbacks, especially when treating tumors at the periphery where light penetration is inadequate and partial removal of malignant cells results. This incomplete removal may facilitate tumor regret and metastasis to other body parts. Due to the previously mentioned limitations, PTT immunotherapy alone is currently frequently insufficient to achieve complete cancer eradication. Many complementary methods, including PDT, immunotherapy, gene therapy, and chemotherapy, are investigated to optimize PTT overall efficacy. These methods can lead to accurate tumor identification and management, providing a comprehensive plan to address a range of cancers and other conditions [8].",

            "text": "Semiconducting polymer films may be a viable alternative to inorganic materials when high performance is less important than cost. Polymers have a significant advantage in that they may be solution processed, which permits film preparation routes such as spin coating, doctor blading, and drop casting. However, polymers need not be dissolved in solution but rather can be dispersed in a liquid medium as latex particles before being cast as films. This is appropriate for certain synthetic routes, such as emulsion polymerization or nanoprecipitation, which result in a particle suspension [1]. These are all compatible with various cross-coupling routes that can be used to synthesize conjugated polymers [2,3]. This wide choice of synthesis and film preparation routes allows fine tuning of the morphological and structural properties of the film. Semiconducting polymer particles can be optimized for light emission [4,5], energy generation [6,7], or phototherapies [8,9], among other purposes [10][11][12]. \n\nThe optoelectronic properties of polymer films depend, at least indirectly, on their morphology as well as their electronic structure. Because optical and electronic properties are inextricably linked, electronic and excitonic transport need to be optimized for the required optical properties. For main-chain conjugated polymers, charge transport benefits from both interchain and intrachain phenomena and also from a good degree of crystallization. Optical properties, however, are less affected by crystallization than transport properties but perturbing the conjugation length of even rigid polymers is known to affect them [13]. Indeed, where comparisons between amorphous and crystalline polymers have been made, it is noted that changes in optical properties are due to the concomitant change in conjugation length as opposed to chain ordering [14,15]. \n\nSemiconducting polymer films that display stimulated emission often have excellent electroluminescent properties, and so effort spent optimizing optical gain is often performed with wider applications in mind [16]. Although optical gain in semiconducting polymer films has been known for some time [17] and is not rare, it is not commonplace either, and some thought is needed to achieve it.",

These methods are limited by the field of view of the microscopes used, and therefore it is important to take a series of snapshots to have confidence in the results. The method described above cannot quantitate bacterial adherence over the entire surface, only infer coverage from a number of small regions. We believe this is sufficient for the application described. Reduction in bacterial binding could be assessed by enumerating surface adhered bacteria on the entire coated and uncoated catheter pieces using methods as described elsewhere 22 . However such methods require the biomaterial surfaces screened to have a uniform surface area, which is difficult to maintain when assays are performed with medical devices, which often have complex geometry.\n\nClearly, any device intended for clinical use must go through substantial further testing to ensure safety and efficacy in humans. The method presented here represents the beginning of this process and further work must include confirmation of in vivo activity. In this case, studying venous catheters, initial work could investigate the binding of blood components and whole cells to the polymer. The effect of blood components on bacterial binding should also be considered, possibly by repeating the binding assays in the presence of inactivated serum or de-fibrinated blood 23 . The definitive test of the technology will be in an in vivo model such as a subcutaneous implant infection model 24 .\n\nWe demonstrate the potential of the polymer microarray method for screening of surface-altering polymers. Such polymers (both resisting and promoting bacterial binding) have a great number of applications in medicine, the food industry and biotechnology, meaning this method may be useful in many areas of research. Although the work here uses bacteria, the method could be adapted to other cell types and likewise other chemical microarrays.",

            "text": "Photothermal therapy (PTT), another light-activatable therapy, collocating PA or NIR-II imaging has exhibited advantages over conventional theranostics such as fluorescence-guided chemotherapy [15,16,[171][172][173][174][175][176][177][178][179][180][181][182]. PA-trackers naturally have photothermal functions, which thus can be regarded as PTT agents. They can synergistically offer deep penetration, high spatial resolution, and effective therapy with minimal side-effects. So far, various NIR-II PTT agents have been prepared from inorganic (copper sulfide, plasma metal clusters, and carbon nanotubes) [183][184][185] and organic materials (small molecules and semiconducting polymers) [186][187][188]. The organic agents usually have relatively excellent biodegradation and biocompatibility, which are desired in in vivo biomedical applications [60]. Compared to small molecules, donor-acceptor (D-A) structured SPs have advantages in good photostability and large extinction coefficient, which can benefit PTT efficacy [62,[180][181][182]. Hence, Liu and Zheng et al. developed NIR-II absorptive SPNs (named P1 NPs, 50-64 nm) with an active targeting cRGD ligand (named P1RGD NPs) for selective targeting of integrin on tumor cell surface (Figure 17A) [181]. Under laser irradiation (1064 nm, 1 W cm \u22122 ), the temperature of P1 NPs (0.1 mg mL \u22121 ) rapidly increased to 64.8 \u2103 within 5 min and the photothermal conversion efficiency (PTCE) was calculated to be 30.1%. In addition, PA signals of P1RGD NPs exhibited 3.5-fold higher than that of P1 NPs at tumor sites (Figure 17B), suggesting that cRGD did significantly enhance tumor uptake.",

            "text": "Semiconducting polymers have been the focus of intense research over the past few decades as promising alternatives to inorganic semiconductors. These materials are suitable for the fabrication of low-cost electronic devices, since they exhibit interesting properties, such as the ease of processing, the ability to obtain large devices deposited on flexible substrates and cost reduction, especially when using deposition techniques from soluble polymers, such as spin-coating, that do not require complex systems, such as evaporation in an ultra-high vacuum. Typical polymer devices that have been extensively studied include light-emitting devices [1] and photovoltaic cells [2]. \n\nAmong the many organic semiconductors available to develop polymer-based electronic devices, polythiophenes have probably been the most extensively investigated. Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) is a solution processable semiconducting polymer well known for its interesting electrical properties: high mobility of holes ranging from 1.33 \u00d7 10 \u22125 cm 2 /V and 3.30 \u00d7 10 \u22124 cm 2 /V, depending on the molecular weight [3], and low width of the band gap (1.9 eV) [4]. For these reasons, P3HT has become a good candidate for developing organic solar cells [5] and organic field effect transistors [6]. However, the use of P3HT for these devices, as well as photodetection applications, is usually reported in combination with other compounds, such as phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) [7], organic dyes [8], TiO 2 nanoparticles [9] or carbon nanotubes [10]. \n\nInterdigitated, or interdigital, electrodes (IDE) have been selected for the polymer characterization, as they are among the most commonly used periodic electrode structures. IDE structures are commonly used for chemical sensing, nondestructive testing, as well as for surface acoustic wave devices and various microelectromechanical systems [11]. The geometry of the IDE structures consists of a finger-like periodic array of parallel in-plane electrodes used to build up the capacitance or the resistance of a layer deposited over the electrodes.",

However, in order to obtain the least side effects possible, organic NPs like PPy are formulated into ultrasmall particles excretable through the kidneys. For example, Zeng et al. reported ultrasmall PPy NPs with size suitable for renal excretion (2 nm), fluorescent, with high contrast in PA and the possibility to shift the adsorption to the second NIR window (Fig. 2(a and b)). These particles are characterized by high photoconversion efficiency (~33% when irradiated with 808 nm laser and ~42% when irradiated with 1064 nm laser) and photostability at both wavelengths (Fig. 2(c-f)) [120]. \n\nOther studies found the functionalization of diketopyrroles with fluorine and chalcogens (particularly selenium) is needed to increase the photothermal conversion efficiency from 32% to 62% due to \u03c0-\u03c0 and F-H interactions [121]. The biocompatibility and biodegradability of semiconducting polymer-based NPs can be controlled via the type of bonds added to the polymeric backbone. Lyu et al. reported a biodegradable semiconducting polymer-based NPs with enhanced photothermal conversion efficiency and biodegradability by introducing vinylene bonds able to be enzymatically oxidized (e.g., by myeloperoxidase in immune cells); the particles showed enhanced PA signal in a 4T1 tumor model, as well as tumor eradication after PTT treatment with a low laser intensity of 0.3 W/cm 2 [78]. \n\nIn addition to the examples discussed above, we include more recently published representative applications of organic NPs in PTT and as theranostic agents in Table 2, presented in terms of their size, photothermal performance, in vitro and in vivo therapeutic effects.",

As SPNs are fabricated from biologically inert organic compounds, they can inherently avoid of heavy metal ion-induced toxicity to tissues and thus possess good biocompatibility [19]. However, narrowing their absorption bandgap within the near-infrared light (NIR) window along with a high extinction coefficient is challenging but essentially needed, which may facilitate efficient NIR photothermal conversion for PAI and PTT [20]. In addition, similar to other nano-scaled biomaterials, artificial phototheranostic nanoagents generally encounter several obstacles in clinical translation, including easy recognition by the immune system, insufficient accumulation in the tumor site, and safety concerns regarding physiological interactions and metabolism, which compromise their potential for clinical practice [21,22].",

            "text": "The potential is a negative charge, which can have a longer blood circulation time. 43 Because of the modification of polyethylene glycol (PEG) by the film-forming material, PEG molecules form a protective hydrophilic layer, which helps to avoid recognition by the immune system, thereby reducing the uptake of PEG-coated nanoparticles by macrophages, allowing NPs to have a long circulation time in the body, and reducing the phagocytosis of the reticuloendothelial system in the body. 10,44 Through the detection of a series of characterizations of the prepared NPs, we conclude that the NPs we prepared are regularly round in shape, have a small overall particle size, can better circulate in the body and enter the site of tumor tissue, and can perform subsequent in vitro and in vivo performance detection experiments. We observed that iRGD-ICG-10-HCPT-PFP-NPs were all able to produce PA signals at different concentrations of dilution, and the PA signals grew with increasing concentration (Figure 2A). The region of interest was selected on the PA detector to determine the PA signal intensity, and it could also be found that only a weak PA signal was visible in the sample with a concentration of 10 \u03bcg/mL. As the concentration of ICG increases, the overall PA signal is linearly enhanced (Figure 2B). In the in vitro phase transition experiment of NPs, we first observed under a light microscope that the NPs presented better stability without any treatment, and the particle size was in a stable state (Figure 2C). After 1 min of LIFU irradiation, the NPs began to show a small part of the phase transition, as shown by the increase in the particle size of a small amount of NPs (Figure 2D). However, after 5 min of LIFU irradiation, the degree of phase transition of the NPs was more pronounced, more bulky NP distribution was observed throughout the field, and in practical observation, the NPs began to become unstable, showed four movements, and had ruptures (Figure 2E). Similar phase transitions can also be found after excitation with a laser.",

            "text": "Although these methods have provided the foundation for cancer diagnosis and treatment, they are nonspecific, costly, and heavily dependent on the growth rate of cancer tumors. [27]In addition, a wide variety of techniques within the field of molecular biology, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, [28] radioimmunoassay, [29] immunohistochemistry, [30,31] flow cytometry, [32] and DNA/RNA-based hybridization/sequencing approaches, [33][34][35][36] have also been widely used to detect molecular signatures/biomarkers in cancer cells.Although current molecular diagnostic techniques have been clinically validated, they frequently exhibit low sensitivity, extended detection times, potential health risks, and the requirement for sophisticated equipment and skilled operators.[39][40][41] Therefore, developing novel detection approaches with efficient nanomaterials that are simple, sensitive, and rapid for early-stage cancer diagnosis is of enormous clinical significance.\n\nIn the field of biosensing, the choice of materials becomes crucial not only for their intrinsic properties but also for their adaptability to interface with various biomolecules. [42]To this end, carbon nanomaterials have a distinct edge: their carbonaceous nature lends itself to a plethora of functional groups that can be introduced either during synthesis or through postsynthetic modifications.Such inherent versatility allows for conjugating a diverse range of biomolecules directly onto the carbon-based scaffold.[47][48][49][50][51] Furthermore, the diverse allotropes of carbon, from graphene to carbon nanotubes, offer varying configurations and densities of these functional sites, [52,53] ensuring that a suitable carbon nanomaterial with the optimal density and orientation of functional groups can be chosen based on the specific requirements of the biosensing applications.\n\nTo date, biosensor development is becoming a prevalent approach for effectual point-of-care testing with high-level accuracy, reproducibility, reliability, stability, affordability, and disposability.

Their high solubility allowed extensive uptake by the U87 cells, leading to high-quality imaging. Organic dyes could also be utilised; spherical nanogels of cyclodextrin/spiropyran/4-amino-7-nitro-1,2,3-benzoxadiazole composite (200 nm diameter) were formulated [70]. Depending on the illumination, these could fluoresce red or green. Selective imaging of Cal27 human tongue cancer cells was possible using these materials. \n\nOne major issue with cancers is that cells can break off tumours, so-called circulating tumour cells, and then be transported by the bloodstream to other parts of the body, giving rise to metastasis. Electroluminescent sensing could be utilised to detect these biomarkers [71], whereby a glassy carbon electrode could be modified with a gold nanoparticle/cyclodextrin/ruthenium complex/graphene composite. Ferrocene-labelled aptamers could be then immobilised on the surface of this composite. The ferrocene units interacted with the ruthenium complex, quenching its electroluminescence. When exposed to tumour cells, binding occurs between the cells and the aptamers, and the resulting change in aptamer conformation causes the ferrocene to move away from the electrode, preventing its quenching effect and allowing electroluminescence to occur. This method allowed highly selective detection of the cancer cells with a detection limit of 40 cells per mL \u22121 .",

            "text": "In this section of the manuscript, we have analyzed the bio-sensing performance of the proposed design with the help of various parameters as listed in Table 4. For the fulfillment of our goal we have calculated the numeric values of parameters FWHM, quality factor (Q), figure of merit (FoM) and limit of detection (LoD) associated with the design under optimum conditions which are already discussed in Sections 4.1 and 4.2 in addition to the sensitivity of the design. The optimum conditions are very helpful to ensure the maximum performance of the design. We have used the standard definitions defined in references [32,33] for calculating the numeric values of parameters FWHM, Q, FoM and LoD associated with our structure. The various parameters evaluating the performance of the proposed design under optimum conditions with d 4 = 15dd, \u03b7 = 0.8, \u03b8 = 63 \u2022 and T = 50 K have been summarized in Table 4. The sensitivity of the design varies between a maximum value of 4139.241 nm/RIU to a minimum value of 3952.305 nm/RIU corresponding to sample wall of the solid brain to lymphoma, respectively. The average value of the sensitivity of the design is 4038. Furthermore, our design also possesses reasonably high quality factor and figure of merit values of order 10 3 which makes our design suitable for sensitive detection of cancerous brain tumors. The order of limit of detection of our design is 10 \u22125 which is extremely low. The low value of the limit of detection is one of the desirable requirements for designing any biosensor. It signifies the smallest change in the refractive index of the sample under investigation which can be detected accurately. Finally, the comparative study shows the outcomes of our proposed work in contrast to the findings of recently published work based on 1D DPhCs for the detection of different kinds of cancerous cells in our body. This comparison has been conducted on the basis of the parameters S, FoM and Q as indicated in Table 5. The analysis of the data presented in Table 5 shows that the proposed design composed of SiO 2 embedded nanocomposite buffer layers of high temperature superconductor has better performance than the other configurations listed in the above table.",

In biosensing, for example, an increased surface area can lead to a greater amount of immobilized reagent on the surface and thus to larger sensor currents. 31 For a review on various sensing applications of organic bioelectronics, we refer to more comprehensive literature. 32,33 llectively, the unique properties of conducting polymers, as compared to traditional materials, offer improved compatibility with cells and tissues. Due to their combined ionic and electronic conductivity, conducting polymers translate between common electronic and biological systems.

Whilst sensitivity has greatly improved with the second-generation assays, current commercial assays are long, expensive, and need to be handled by experts making them inadequate point-of-care tools. Furthermore, it is important to highlight that the current use of CA125 is focused on disease monitoring rather than early detection because the detection of biomarker is not sufficiently sensitive or specific (Duffy et al., 2005;Scholler & Urban, 2007). Currently, a large area of scientific interest concentrates on the use of CA125 and complementary biomarker quantification as tools for early cancer diagnosis. This study highlights the benefits of using semiconducting polymers and graphene electrodes for the detection of a CA125. Overall, the analytical performance of the biosensor suggests its potential for successful application as a point-of-care diagnostic device.",

            "text": "According to reports of the WHO, approximately 9 million people died in 2015 from a variety of cancers (Pourakbari et al. 2020). In recent decades, the rates of death from cancer malignancies have sharply increased. However, by improving the early stage detection processes, the cancer mortality rates could be reduced significantly (Fitzgerald 2020). The most routinely employed methods for colon cancer diagnosis, including colonoscopy, fecal immunochemical test (FIT) (Gupta et al. 2013), and sigmoidoscopy (Winawer et al. 1993), are based on tissue sampling, imaging, etc. (Rathore et al. 2013). These approaches have several disadvantages, such as invasive nature, time-consuming processes, high cost, and especially insufficient sensitivity for early detection of malignancies (Grossman et al. 1989). On the other hand, the application of biosensors (as new detection devices), and their combination with advanced nanomaterials (Jaymand 2011;Jafarizad et al. 2018) and biomaterials (Massoumi et al. 2020) for early stage and precise diagnosis of cancers has increased nowadays in the biomedical research areas (Pourakbari et al. 2019;Isildak et al. 2020;Khalilzadeh et al. 2019Khalilzadeh et al. , 2017)). Biosensors offer some benefits including; ultrahigh sensitivity, desirable selectivity, cost-effectiveness, real-time monitoring, and fast response time. These features make biosensors potent, on-desk, and ready-to-use devices for clinical analyses, which also have a robust capacity for both in vitro and in vivo applications for routine clinical laboratory tests (Soleymani and Li 2017;Hasanzadeh et al. 2018;Manzoori et al. 2012;Soleymani et al. 2017). The lack of sufficient sensitivity to low concentrations of cancer biomarkers in unprocessed blood or serum in the past decades has forced the development of new strategies, such as the merging of nanotechnology and electrochemical biosensors that can partially overcome this problem.",

            "text": "The application of polymers as supporting materials in microfluidic systems is well established, however the electronic sensing units in most chips are fabricated from metallic conductors such as platinum or gold. Biocompatibility, high sensitivity and specificity are a demand in modern medical biosensors. Biocompatibility is required because some biological applications involve living cells, bacteria or virus. High specificity and sensitivity is essential for detecting highly diluted analytes in biological samples, because the samples contain a cocktail of similar components, which can influence a measurement. All of these requirements can be fulfilled by the metal electrode materials such as solid platinum or gold (Prodromidis & Karayannis, 2002). Though, a major disadvantage of the noble metals is the high cost, which is continuously increasing. Conjugated polymers are an alternative to the traditional electrode materials. The electronic structure of these compounds gives them properties similar to inorganic semiconductors. In 1977, Shirakawa et al. discovered that doping polyacetylene with halogens increased the conductivity by up to four orders of magnitude. The following research on this topic by Shirakawa, MacDiarmid and Heeger was awarded with the Nobel prize in chemistry in 2000.\n\nOver the years, electronically conductive polymers have been proposed for many applications (Jagur-Grodzinski, 2002; Olson et al., 2010) -from biomedical sensors to nanowire integration in photovoltaic cells or printable RFID antennae -yet only few have made it to the market. Among those are electrochromic coatings for windows, antistatic coatings, organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), corrosion protection for metals or surface finish for printed circuit boards (Groenendaal et al., 2000;Gustafsson et al., 1994;Wessling, 2001). The usage of conductive polymer electrode in biosensor application is rising. The immediate advantage of conductive polymer electrodes is the much lower cost of the raw materials and the inexpensive production steps. Certain polymers offer high biocompatibility and options for modifying the properties by varying side groups. This can be useful for probe immobilization, which is a crucial procedure in biosensors. Conductive polymers allow a broad range of chemical modifications for covalent attachment of enzymes, antibodies, DNA or",

Absorption bands at 1728 cm \u22121 and 1110 cm \u22121 correspond to characteristic carbonyl ester bonds CvO and C-O stretching, respectively. A small aromatic peak at 1450 cm \u22121 can also be observed and the small band at 1034 cm \u22121 is assignable to Si-O bonds. \n\nThe average hydrodynamic diameter D H of bare IONPs was 194 nm with a polydispersity index of 0.30 while after functionalization, the D H of MNCs was reduced to 120 nm with a polydispersity index of 0.16. Introducing a hydrophilic polymer coating on the NP surface stabilizes the IONPs, preventing particle agglomeration and therefore also reducing the attractive inter-particle dipole-dipole interaction and van der Waals forces. NPs in the size range of 10-200 nm preferentially accumulate into tumour than healthy tissue owing to the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. 45 Due to the defective vascular architecture of tumours and the impaired lymphatic clearance, NP extravasation and retainment into tumour tissue is favoured. The D H of the MNCs of 120 nm, is optimal for the EPR effect. \n\nThe organic content of the MNCs was determined using TGA in the temperature range from 25 \u00b0C to 500 \u00b0C. Fig. 6b shows the weight loss of the MNCs as a function of temperature. Polymer thermal decomposition occurs between 240 \u00b0C and 420 \u00b0C with a weight loss of 8.1 wt%, therefore corresponding to the polymer content of the MNCs. An average number of 24 polymer chains per NP can be calculated.",

These applications broadly range from in vivo (sensing and stimulating specific cells, tissues, and organs) to in vitro applications (biosensing of analytes in liquid biopsies and modeling human physiology in cell culture). Comparatively few devices have been tested in vivo in humans, reflecting the current state of the material and device development, [2] as well as the regulatory framework surrounding medical devices, hence we highlight the most relevant examples here. This report focuses mostly on developments from roughly the past five years, with reference to prior seminal works or reviews as appropriate. It is written for readers who wish to see a broad overview of the ways conjugated polymers are being used to interface with the human body, with enough relevant theory to allow them to engage with the arguments and results presented. Where more specific reviews for a given topic exist, we have signposted them in the appropriate locations. We focus exclusively on interfaces that use highly conjugated polymers to interface an aspect of human physiology, where the polymer's primary proposed use relies on its electronic properties. For example, we do not discuss organic small molecule devices, conjugated polymer nanoparticles for imaging or optical biosensing, [3][4][5] biomimicking neuromorphic designs, [6][7][8] hydrogen-bond mediated bioprotonics, [9][10][11] or polymers for nonelectronic/ionic driven drug delivery. [12] We also include a brief discussion of the origin of bioelectricity itself, as this is fundamental to the motivation and application of many organic bioelectronic interfaces.",

            "text": "Electrospun polymer nanofibers of PA6/PAH modified with either MWCNTs or AuNPs were used as matrix for the immobilization of anti-CA19-9 antibodies, which served as immunosensors to detect CA19-9 biomarker using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The nanostructured architectures showed high sensitivity in detecting the commercial CA19-9 in a buffer and for distinguishing blood serum samples of patients with distinct concentrations of the biomarker. The three-dimensional structure of the electrospun nanofibers, as revealed with SEM images, appears to be relevant for the successful preservation of the antibody activity. This high sensitivity and selectivity toward CA19-9 in the presence of interferents may be attributed to the antibody\u2212antigen irreversible adsorption, which was confirmed here with PM-IRRAS spectroscopy in which amide bands were affected by exposure of the immunosensors to CA19-9. The adsorption process, in particular, is typical of Langmuir\u2212Freundlich processes. The clear distinction of blood serum samples of the patients likely to develop pancreatic cancer from those with smaller CA19-9 concentrations, below the value considered as threshold (37 U mL \u22121 ), was achieved by treating the electrochemical impedance data with a multidimensional projection technique. This is a limitation of the present study because a calibration curve for a quantitative analysis cannot be obtained in a straightforward manner. Future experiments with a larger number of blood serum samples are therefore required for generating sufficient data to which regression analysis methods can be applied to yield a quantitative determination of CA19-9 concentrations. An avenue will then be open for a simple, fast diagnosis of pancreatic cancer at early stages using an immunosensor platform that can also be utilized for other diseases.\n\n4.

            "text": "Semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) are another new photonic biomaterial with great potential for theranostic applications. SPNs are designed to improve the sensitivity and resolution of PAI because of the tunable optical properties, high absorption coefficients and high photostability of this material [51]. In 2019, through reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization of polystyrene-b-poly (N-isopropylacrylamide-co-acrylic acid) (PSNiAA), Xu's team prepared a functional nanoparticles (PDPP3T@PSNiAA) with photothermal sensitivity and PA response [52]. Anti-cancer drug Doxorubicin (Dox) was also loaded onto these NPs by electrostatic interaction and formed PDPP3T@PSNiAA-Dox NPs. The data showed that all PDPP3T@PSNiAA-Dox NPs at different concentrations had a time-dependent increasing laser irradiation response. The temperature of the NPs could still increase to the same level even up to the fourth laser-cooling circle, indicating the photothermal stability of PDPP3T@PSNiAA-Dox NPs. Additionally, experiments for the PA properties of these NPs conducted in vitro showed that the maximum intensity of PDPP3T@PSNiAA NPs was at 785 nm, and the higher concentration of NPs contributed to higher PA signals. The in vivo experiments indicated that these PDPP3T@PSNiAA-Dox NPs could accumulate in tumor region over time (Figure 7). A burst intracellular Dox release occurred with NIR irradiation at acidic condition (80%), while it was below 40% at neutral condition, which could minimize the release of the drug in normal tissues. In vivo studies on HeLa tumor-bearing mice showed that tumors of PDPP3T@PSNiAA-Dox NPs with laser treatment were effectively eliminated without reoccurrence, while groups treated with free Dox (with and without laser) and NPs without laser showed none or minor tumor elimination.",

            "text": "Nanotechnology represents a new therapeutic platform that employs nanoparticles (NPs) in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. NPs are used in cancer therapy due to their relatively small size, 1-1,000 nm, the fact that they frequently fall within the range of 10-200 nm, and the presence of the EPR effect (Rajesh, 2000;Reddy, 2005;Fang et al., 2011). Nano-drug delivery systems have been lauded for their excellent biocompatibility properties, low toxicity, increased solubility in water, in addition to their ability to deliver targeted drugs to tissues which limits their accumulation in the kidneys, liver, spleen, and other nontargeted organs, while improving therapeutic efficacy (Kumari et al., 2016;Li et al., 2017). The delivery of nanoparticles to tumor tissues through systemic circulation can be executed through two targeting strategies, including passive targeting, when nanoparticles entering circulation will accumulate at the tumor site due to enhanced permeation and retention (EPR). In contrast, active targeting, generally employs ligand molecules such as antibodies and peptides to recognize specific antigens expressed in tumor cells or the microenvironment (Kumari et al., 2016). \n\nMany types of nanoparticles exist, including polymeric therapy (polymer-protein and polymer-drug conjugates) in which drugs are covalently bound or conjugated to polymer structures and nanoparticulate drugs. The drugs are physically trapped in assembled particles composed of different materials such as polymers (polymer micelles, dendrimers and polymer nanoparticles), lipids (liposomes), or organometallic compounds (carbon nanotubes). The first generation of anticancer nanoparticles approved by the FDA include liposomal drugs and polymer conjugates (Barenholz, 2012;P\u00e9rez-Herrero and Fern\u00e1ndez-Medarde, 2015). However, certain products can be subjected to in vivo and clinical trials, while others remain limited to in vitro studies. Therefore, the effectiveness and safety of the nanoparticle drug constitute important assessed parameters.",

SPNs are designed to improve the sensitivity and resolution of PAI because of the tunable optical properties, high absorption coefficients and high photostability of this material [51]. In 2019, through reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization of polystyrene-b-poly (Nisopropylacrylamide-co-acrylic acid) (PSNiAA), Xu's team prepared a functional nanoparticles (PDPP3T@PSNiAA) with photothermal sensitivity and PA response [52]. Anti-cancer drug Doxorubicin (Dox) was also loaded onto these NPs by electrostatic interaction and formed PDPP3T@PSNiAA-Dox NPs. The data showed that all PDPP3T@PSNiAA-Dox NPs at different concentrations had a time-dependent increasing laser irradiation response. The temperature of the NPs could still increase to the same level even up to the fourth laser-cooling circle, indicating the photothermal stability of PDPP3T@PSNiAA-Dox NPs. Additionally, experiments for the PA properties of these NPs conducted in vitro showed that the maximum intensity of PDPP3T@PSNiAA NPs was at 785 nm, and the higher concentration of NPs contributed to higher PA signals. The in vivo experiments indicated that these PDPP3T@PSNiAA-Dox NPs could accumulate in tumor region over time (Figure 7). A burst intracellular Dox release occurred with NIR irradiation at acidic condition (80%), while it was below 40% at neutral condition, which could minimize the release of the drug in normal tissues. In vivo studies on HeLa tumor-bearing mice showed that tumors of PDPP3T@PSNiAA-Dox NPs with laser treatment were effectively eliminated without reoccurrence, while groups treated with free Dox (with and without laser) and NPs without laser showed none or minor tumor elimination.",

            "text": "Conjugated polymer nanoparticles are attractive fluorescent bioimaging probes due to their excellent optical properties and low cytotoxicity. Up until now, a whole range of conjugated polymer particles has been synthesized, with particle sizes ranging from the nano-to the micrometer scale and with colors covering the entire visible range. Most conjugated polymers used for imaging have a rather simple backbone structure, often based on fluorine [40,[42][43][44][45]48,57,60,61]. On the other hand, a huge variety of push-pull type semiconducting polymers have recently been studied for optoelectronic applications, notably organic photovoltaics [71]. We believe that many of these materials could be useful for imaging too. The combination of strong donor and acceptor monomers leads to low bandgap materials of which the absorption and emission maxima can be pushed toward the NIR region. This wavelength range is of particular interest for bioimaging because of the low autofluorescence and deep tissue penetration of NIR light. Unfortunately, the photoluminescence quantum yield generally drops when the NIR regime is approached. Different techniques have been employed to boost the fluorescence intensity. Most of these techniques rely on the prevention or limitation of \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking in the particles. Nevertheless, quantum efficiencies hardly reach values over 50%. The introduction of specific moieties known to exhibit aggregation induced emission seems to be an attractive alternative solution, since those materials exhibit higher emission efficiencies when tight packing can be achieved [40,[43][44][45][46][47][48][49][50][51]. \n\nSurface functionalization of the conjugated polymer nanoparticles is needed to target specific cells. Functional groups allowing bioconjugation have been introduced on the conjugated polymer backbone itself or on non-conjugated (matrix) materials such as PEG chains or silica. The most frequently introduced functional groups are carboxylic acids and amines. However, due to their pH dependent charge, functionalized particles experience difficulties to enter cells under certain conditions.",

            "text": "Biosensors have been extensively utilized in several fields such as biotechnology, food inspection, medical diagnostics, and environmental monitoring since their inception by Lyons and Clark in the 1960s (102).Electrochemical biosensors are a very sensitive detection technology that offers the benefits of easy operation and cost-effectiveness (103).Currently, the extended implementation of electrochemical biosensors encounters two significant obstacles.One must determine how to implement it in clinical settings when faced with resistance to interference.The second issue is how to sustain high detection efficiency following the application of antifouling compounds.Utilizing electrochemical biosensors in clinical practice is currently a significant challenge due to the potential issue of nonspecific protein adsorption in complex biological samples like human whole blood.This can lead to decreased sensitivity and specificity in detection, resulting in false positive responses (104).Many approaches aimed at reducing background interference and nonspecific interactions have experienced significant progress (105).A sample dilution was used to reduce the background signals.Although effective in reducing the presence of non-target molecules, this method may not always be practical (106).Surface blocking has had significant success in targeting therapeutic sites in human physiological fluids by utilizing adsorbed and non-reactive substances like Tween 20, BSA (bovine serum albumin), and commercially available combinations (66).Polymeric separation membranes have made significant progress in minimizing nonspecific adsorption on gold surfaces, utilizing poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) polymer (107), zwitterionic polymer (108), and peptide (109).Phosphocholine has emerged as a promising antifouling membrane material in recent years.Phosphocholine can imitate eukaryotic membrane properties (110), making it very resistant to protein or cell nonspecific adsorption.This is achieved by creating a hydration layer through strong water binding (111).Phosphocholine-integrated layers are short, which increases the likelihood of fast electron transfer.\n\nSerum-soluble folate binding protein (FBP) is a crucial tumor marker, and there is a strong demand for the creation of a straightforward biosensing technique.",

            "text": "The utilization of nanomaterials as adjuvants for identifying and eliminating microscopic disseminated tumors provides a promising opportunity to reduce residual disease, a key aspect to improving survival.\n\nCurrently, numerous nanoparticle types and formulations have been explored as adjuvants for targeting and treating tumors in vivo [7][8][9][10][11]. Polymerbased nanoparticles offer versatility in their tunable optical properties, easy synthesis, stability, nearinfrared fluorescence, and photothermal capabilities [9,10,[12][13][14][15][16][17]. Hybrid Donor-Acceptor Polymer Particles (HDAPPs) are theranostic nanoparticles derived from a specific blend of two unique conjugated polymers: the donor-acceptor polymer poly [4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b']dith iophene-2,6-diyl-alt-2,1,3-benzoselenadiazole-4,7-diyl ] (PCPDTBSe), which has been synthesized to produce heat generating nanoparticles for photothermal ablation of tumors, and the fluorescent conjugated polymer poly[(9,9-dihexylfluorene)-co-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-co-4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadi azole] (PFBTDBT10) [10,12,14]. The PCPDTBSe and PFBTDBT10 blend used to yield HDAPPs has been shown to produce on-demand heat generation and a unique far-red fluorescence signal (825 nm) due to an amplified energy transfer phenomenon [10,18,19].\n\nNon-targeted HDAPPs were previously used to photothermally ablate breast tumors using nearinfrared (NIR) laser irradiation to stimulate the nanoparticles, plus they were easily detected using fluorescence imaging [10]. HDAPPs for the current study were functional",

            "text": "Proteins serve as commonly utilized cancer markers in the field of oncology [119,120]. However, traditional protein sensors may lack the required sensitivity when detecting certain biomarkers with extremely low concentrations in physiological environments due to the typically weak interactions between proteins and organic semiconductors. OETBs can address this limitation by providing an enhanced sensitivity through their inherent amplification capability. These OETBs demonstrate an ability to specifically detect cancer markers, e.g., human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, with a detection limit as low as 10 fg mL \u22121 [121]. \n\nGlycoproteins, as protein-sugar complexes, are essential components found on cell surfaces in eukaryotic cells, playing key roles in cancer progression [122][123][124]. A specially designed OETB, incorporating a PEDOT-PSS channel and a gate electrode modified with poly dimethyl diallyl ammonium chloride/multi-walled CNTs has been proven to effectively and specifically bind mannose and detect glycan molecules onto the surface of cancer cells (Figure 8a) [125]. The OETB generates direct current signals that are influenced by the mannose content on the cell surfaces, thereby impacting the captured cell count. It exhibits significant current responses even at low concentrations of cancer cells (i.e., 10 cells/\u00b5L). Moreover, by modifying the lectin and aptamer sequences, the OETB can be adapted for the analysis of various glycans and cancer cells.",

            "text": "The application of photoelectrochemical (PEC) nanosensors in tumor liquid biopsy shows great potential. Through a combination of optical and electrochemical properties, PEC nanosensors offer low cost, high sensitivity, and immediate analysis. These sensors, based on nanostructured surfaces or integrated with nanomaterials, can be used to detect biomarkers for liquid biopsies such as circulating nucleic acids, circulating tumor cells, and tumor-derived exosomes [8]. Not only that, photoelectric sensors can be used for noninvasive glucose monitoring to help diabetic patients monitor their blood glucose levels by analyzing glucose concentration under the skin. It can also measure the oxygen level in the blood through the reflection of infrared and red light to help assess the patient's oxygen saturation. To detect the tumor suppressor gene P53, Li et al. developed a photoelectric sensor based on BiVO4/Ag2S heterojunction in conjunction with Exo iiiaided silver nanoclusters, as shown in Figure 3. BiVO4, one of them, considerably increases the sensitivity of photoelectric sensors by generating BiVO4/Ag2S heterojunctions, which is an outstanding photosensitive material. P53 inhibitory genes may be precisely detected using the improved photocurrent signal. This is advantageous for early tumor diagnosis [9]. An et al. reported a near-infrared light-responsive photoelectric sensor that can be used to monitor human motion. The main matrix material of the sensor is a selfrepairing and flexible polyacrylamide hydrogel. By introducing multi-walled carbon nanotubes into the hydrogel, the composite has better tensile strength and conductivity. The light point sensor prepared with this material can not only serve as a strain sensor to monitor human movement, including hand movements, elbow movements, and even swallowing, but can also be used for near-infrared detectors, medical devices, and wearable devices [10]. \n\nWith the continuous development of technology, the application of photoelectric sensors in the field of medical testing is very promising and will provide a more accurate and reliable method for diagnosis, and treatment.",

            "text": "Regardless of the specific roles that polymers play in each type of protein detection method, an ideal application of polymers should promote not only qualitative but also quantitative detection both rapidly and cost-effectively along with high specificity and sensitivity. The chemical complexity and heterogeneity of protein analytes need to be addressed when selecting appropriate polymeric surfaces in the detection scheme in order to maintain the natural conformation and activity of proteins during intended measurements. Quantification of protein molecules via signal interpretation should ideally be direct and straightforward. These important characteristics need to be considered for all modes of polymeric applications in protein detection, whether they are used as substrate platforms in optical arrays, incorporated into the electrodes in electrochemical cells, coated onto the sensor layers in mass-sensitive resonators, or applied to the non-sensing regions of FET devices. In addition to the relatively small subset of polymers that are used currently in protein detection, more biocompatible and biostable polymeric materials should be developed and assessed for their effectiveness in a protein detection setting. \n\nIn optical detection involving an array-style of protein screening, ideal polymeric substrates should enable quantifiable, parallel, small-volume assays to be readily applied to large numbers of samples. They should also feature reliable placement of protein molecules in a well-defined, highly dense pattern. Current difficulties associated with the application of proteins printed on polymeric surfaces lie in multiple areas of sensor development and detection. They include the precise control over protein density, spot density, protein orientation, spotting uniformity, array standardization, array stability, and detection sensitivity. Increasing the signal-to-noise ratio of current optical detection platforms is also of great significance, especially when the detection is carried out without any means of signal amplification. In addition to the need for an increased signal-to-noise ratio in many fluorescence-based techniques, correlating optical signal intensity to protein concentration reliably and accurately is a demanding task in these techniques. More standardized and direct methods to compare the measured optical signal to the amount of proteins in the reaction are currently warranted. Improvements in protein spotting processes are necessary in order to produce uniformly printed proteins on various optical detection platforms.",

Liquid biopsies such as blood samples are matrices explored to extract valuable information about the tumor and its state through various indicators, such as proteins, peptides, tumor DNA, or circulating tumor cells. Although these markers are scarce, making their isolation and detection in complex matrices challenging, the development in polymer chemistry producing interesting structures, including molecularly imprinted polymers, branched polymers, nanopolymer composites, and hybrids, allowed the development of enhanced platforms with impressive performance for liquid biopsies analysis. This review describes the latest advances and developments in polymer synthesis and their application for minimally invasive cancer diagnosis. The polymer structures improve the operational performances of biosensors through various processes, such as increased affinity for enhanced sensitivity, improved binding, and avoidance of non-specific interactions for enhanced specificity. Furthermore, polymer-based materials can be a tremendous help in signal amplification of usually low-concentrated targets in the sample. The pros and cons of these materials, how the synthesis process affects their performance, and the device applications for liquid biopsies diagnosis will be critically reviewed to show the essentiality of this technology in oncology and clinical biomedicine.",

A more innovative modified structure shown in Fig. 6 exhibits high anticancer efficiency by conjugating DOX on to the QD modified with a glycoprotein, e.g., MUC 1 which realizes the targeted delivery (Savla et al. 2011). Some reports show that graphene or graphene oxide-based FRET sensor incorporating the design with antibody-DNA-Au NP can be used for detecting cancer cells (Jung et al. 2010). \n\nCRET techniques apply luminescence organic chemicals to excite an acceptor in CRET pair. The graphene-based CRET sensor has been developed for detecting the interaction between anti-C-Reactive Protein (CRP) and the C-Reactive Protein (CRP). Such immune sensor can accurately detect the C-reactive protein level. The amount of CRP with respect to the normal levels is usually less than 3 mg L \u22121 . The concentration of CRP significantly increases when there is an infection associated with cardiovascular disease, in this case, the primary issue is focused towards Lymphoma Cancer. Higher CRP concentrations have been reported towards lung, pancreatic, breast, ovary, esophagus, liver, biliary tract, stomach, and multiple myeloma (Heikkila et al. 2007). \n\nThe new stepping stone of surface-modified Apt-PBMC and the CRP-capturing ability is examined (Hwang et al. 2016). The new innovation which drives as a stepping stone fluorescence imaging towards the detection of CRP has been examined. The new surface-modified engineering application is a new innovative idea towards cancer treatment. The Apt-PBMC complex had a recognition towards different concentrations of CRP and had an impact towards the fluorescence intensity levels. As the concentrations of the CRP increased, the fluorescence intensity increased (Hwang et al. 2016).",

            "text": "Polymers are often used as carriers in many targeted drug therapies that require shielding from the immune system and enzymatic degradation. Polymer coating decreases the surface energy of the materials by blocking the active/ reactive sites that can interact with other materials or cells. This not only increases the stability of the materials but also helps them escape the immune system (14). Because of these properties, they offer tremendous applications in targeted drug delivery. \n\nA special class of nanomaterials, known as conjugated polymeric nanomaterials (CPNs), has recently gained increased attention for theranostic applications as an alternative to metallic and inorganic nanomaterials. The myriad of theranostic applications of CPNs stem from their \u03c0-conjugated backbone facilitating electron exchange and an intrinsic ability to interact with light (3). The diagnostic applications of CPNs are based on multiple techniques such as fluorescence imaging (15), two-photon imaging (16), near-infrared (NIR) imaging (17), photoacoustic imaging (18), and multimodal imaging. Minimally invasive therapeutic applications exploit photothermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT). Their candidature as efficient theranostic agents is bolstered by their superior macrophage evasion ability, higher bioavailability, and enhanced solubility over free protein therapeutics after suitable modifications (19,20). The physicochemical properties of CPNs can be easily tuned by the choice of polymer (21). Protein-polymer conjugates combine the stability of polymeric particles and the therapeutic action of proteins to achieve maximum effect. The conjugation of polymers such as PEG and poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) with therapeutic protein provides functional and structural advantages. Especially, the biodegradable polymers conjugated to therapeutic protein can encapsulate cytotoxic drugs for targeted delivery to cancer cells benefiting multimodal therapy (22)(23)(24). Another strategy to target cancer cells includes combination therapy which involves administration of multiple therapeutics to achieve a similar effect. One of the therapeutics can be a protein molecule involved in pathways that cause cell death.",

            "text": ", this process occurs at an elevated rate in tumor tissue and is related to proliferation and metastasis of cancer cells. 21 Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a potent proangiogenic agent that is pivotal to the angiogenic process, and thus an attractive target for cancer therapy, as well as a useful means for early cancer detection. 21 Current methods for the detection and quantification of VEGF include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, VEGF receptors, and field-effect transistor biosensors. 21 There, however, exists room for improvement in the sensitivity and ease of use of these tests. To this end, Kwon et al combined conducting polymer (polypyrrole) nanotubes with aptamers (nanosize molecules with a great degree of sensitivity and specificity for target molecules), bonded to the nanotubes, in a modified biosensor for the detection of VEGF. 21 Two carboxylated polypyrrole carbon nanotubes (CPNT) were synthesized (CPNT 1, 190-220 nm; CPNT 2, 100-130 nm), attached to biosensors, and evaluated. Although both CPNTs displayed a high degree of sensitivity in detecting VEGF, CPNT 2 exhibited approximately twofold higher sensitivity, highlighting the significance of size in this detection method. The increased sensitivity of the transducer with CPNT 2 was attributed to increased conductivity as a result of the augmented surface area exposed in CPNT 2, a consequence of the smaller dimensions. 21 The presence of aptamer on CPNT 2 produced superior sensitivity compared with non-aptamer based biosensors and the larger size of CPNT 1. In addition, rapid real-time detection adds another favorable dimension to this system, as the biological events detected can be converted directly into a measurable signal and no labeling of samples is required. 12,21 Kwon et al were successful in detecting previously unprecedented low levels of VEGF, which could have enormous implications for the early detection of several cancers. Furthermore, the modified biosensor system developed is reusable, enhancing the practicality and attractiveness of this detection device. 21 In the case of colorectal cancer, doctors examine the colorectal lining with the aid of a fiberoptic camera",

A very good separation was achieved in the principal component space between the patterns of healthy controls and of patients suffering from lung, colon, and breast cancers, as seen in Figure  2A -C. Complementary analysis has not shown any correlation between the classification quality and the age of the sensors. The cluster of prostate cancer patients ( Figure 2D) slightly overlaps with the healthy cluster, probably owing to the fact that many of the prostate cancer test groups have stage I cancer. Moreover, we were able to distinguish between the patterns of the four different cancers in the same principal component plot, with only minimal overlap between the prostate cancer and healthy clusters, as seen in Figure 2E. Notably, although we used the same study populations in Figure 2A -E, the clusters appear differently in principal component space, because the input data for the statistical  . The sensors were formed by successively drop casting the solutions of the molecularly modified GNP solutions onto 10 pairs of pre-prepared Ti/Au-inter-digitated electrodes. The left inset in the sensor's schematics shows a tunnelling electron micrograph (TEM) of the NPs, which connects the electrodes and forms multiple paths between them. The right inset of the sensor's schematics shows schematics of films based on molecularly modified GNPs. In these films, the metallic particles provide the electric conductivity, and the organic film component provides sites for the sorption of analyte (guest) molecules. In addition to their role as an adsorptive phase, the presence of welldefined organic spacers (i.e., capping molecules) allows a control over the inter-particle distance, and thereby, obtaining nearly uniform inter-particle distances in the composite films.

Anti-EpCAM was conjugated to the surface by a cross-linker glutaraldehyde for cell capture. The combination of anti-EpCAM and a marker for hepatocellular carcinoma, anti-GPC3, was conjugated to SiO 2 NPs modified with ZnSe and incubated with the captured cells. Enumeration of captured cells was performed by square-wave voltammetry measurements, as well as fluorescence imaging. For proof of principle, cells were detected at concentrations as low as five cells/mL using spiked hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Further experiments with spiked cells in blood and clinical samples were not performed.\n\nFurthermore, a novel biosensor with GO NPs for detection of breast cancer biomarkers was developed by Myung et al. 97 As shown by transmission electron microscopy, amine-terminated SiO 2 NPs were coated with negatively charged GO. These GO-coated NPs were self-organized on the surface of functionalized oxide substrate with a metal electrode.

            "text": "Over the last decade, organic bioelectronics have become more popular and widely used in biological research and medicine [1][2][3][4]. Organic bioelectronics are based on conductive polymers and inherit their flexibility, optical transparency and electrical and ionic conductivity. Further, they can be adapted and functionalized in a wide variety of ways thanks to organic chemistry methods. This combination of structural and functional flexibility makes them especially well-suited to applications in the medical field since it allows precise modeling of various attributes of cells and human tissues [5,6]. This review demonstrates the most recent developments in organic bioelectronics with important implications for biological research and medicine. \n\nConductive polymers are organic compounds featuring a conjugated backbone and doping agents, which can reversibly associate or dissociate depending on the redox state of the backbone. In the conjugated backbone, chemical bonds mesomerize into alternating single and double bonds. In this energetically favourable state electrons are localized in the fully occupied valence band represented by the \"highest occupied molecule orbital\" (HOMO) separated from the unoccupied conduction band, represented by the \"lowest unoccupied molecule orbital\" (LUMO). HOMO and LUMO are energetically separated by the band gap energy (Eg). Thus, pristine conjugated polymers are semiconductors and Eg determines their optical properties. Chemical tuning can be performed in order to adjust Eg. Generally, more planar polymer structures feature smaller band gap energies within the energy spectrum of visible light [7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14]. \n\nDoping is the introduction of additional charge carriers into the conjugated polymer and increases the electrical conductivity [10]. Thus, doped conjugated polymers are called conductive polymers. Doping occurs by chemical reduction (n-type) or oxidation (p-type). The dopant acts as counter-ion to equilibrate the charge along the oxidised or reduced backbone. Conducting polymers therefore act like ionic complexes and their properties are largely dependent on the conjugated backbone, redox state and doping agent [15].",

            "text": "Conjugated polymers (CPs) have attracted much attention in the fields of chemistry, medicine, life science, and material science. Researchers have carried out a series of innovative researches and have made significant research progress regarding the unique photochemical and photophysical properties of CPs, expanding the application range of polymers. CPs are polymers formed by the conjugation of multiple repeating light-emitting units. Through precise control of their structure, functional molecules with different properties can be obtained. Fluorescence probes with different absorption and emission wavelengths can be obtained by changing the main chain structure. By modifying the side chain structure with water-soluble groups or selective recognition molecules, electrostatic interaction or specific binding with specific targets can be achieved; subsequently, the purpose of selective recognition can be achieved. This article reviews the research work of CPs in cell imaging, tumor diagnosis, and treatment in recent years, summarizes the latest progress in the application of CPs in imaging, tumor diagnosis, and treatment, and discusses the future development direction of CPs in cell imaging, tumor diagnosis, and treatment.",

            "text": "There are many types of nanoparticles, including metallic, magnetic, polymeric, metal oxide, quantum dots, graphene, fullerene, liposomes, carbon nanotubes, and dendrimers, which are used in breast, colon, and cervical cancer diagnosis. Additionally, they are important for some imaging functions. It has been found that nanoparticles remain in the blood circulation for a long period of time before reaching the target cells, where they traverse many biological walls such as cell membranes and interact with biological systems (Figure 2). Moreover, cancer-specific antibodies can be conjugated with nanoparticles for better cancer binding and detection. Many recent studies have demonstrated that nanoparticles and sensors have significant potential for increasing the sensitivity of tumor detection and improving cancer diagnosis [13]. It has been reported that the detection of methylation patterns and mutations has been used as a marker for cancer diagnosis. It has been suggested that more studies are required before using extracellular vesicles, circulating tumor cells, and cell-free RNA in clinical diagnosis [14]. Researchers have used fluorescent gold nanoclusters (GNCs) or superparamagnetic (Fe3O4/GNCs), (\u03b3-Mercaptopropyl) trimethoxysilane (MPS) as a stabilizing agent. The prepared GNCs@MPS was conjugated on the surface of \"Fe3O4@SiO2 nanoparticles\" followed by the addition of \"poly ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (PGD)\" to form Fe3O4/GNCs nanoprobes. It has been found that (Fe3O4/GNCs/Aptamer) is capable of uptake in HL60 cancer cells [15]. Various metallic nanoparticles have shown better sensitivity in detecting tumor cells as they can be conjugated with cancer-specific antibodies and penetrate cancer cells more effectively. Studies have reported that nanocomposites containing more than one type of nanoparticle, such as gold, platinum, silver, copper, and cobalt, are better candidates for cancer detection and imaging.",

The whole idea of such chemical modification seems to come up with either novel structures or enhancing the photostability as well as targetability to cancer cells. Most of the organic polymers are basically insulators. These kinds of organic polymers become conductors only when they have \u03c0-conjugated structures, in which variety of mechanisms exist, such as hopping, tunneling etc., aiding a smooth electron motion along the polymer backbone via overlaps in \u03c0-electron clouds. Generally, such \u03c0-electronic polymer systems in their pristine states are wide-band-gap semiconductors, also known as semiconducting polymers. As per discoveries in the 1970s, organic conjugated polymers and oligomers were found to have metallic traits upon heavy doping [66], as a term originally taken from inorganic semiconductor chemistry. The fact is that the conjugated polymer has a doping mechanism through oxidation (p-doping) or reduction (n-doping), respectively [67]. On the other hand, SPN based drug delivery systems became attractive mainly due to its opto-electronic properties in particular for various photo-thermal applications for anticancer therapy. In addition, they have tunable optoelectronic characteristics of metals or semiconductors and can still bear their innate mechanical characteristics and ease of preparation/manufacturing benefits, being polymers [68]. therapy.

            "text": "We propose a highly sensitive and simple detection method for extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are promising biomarkers for cancer diagnosis. The limit of detection (LOD) was improved 29-fold by optimizing the height of the microchannel at the detection region of the surface-functionalized power-free (SF-PF) microchip and the EV-capturing protocol. The LOD was 6.3 \u00d7 10 10 particles/mL, which is less than the total EV concentration in the blood. The required detection time was 19 min and the EV sample volume was 2.0 \u00b5L. These results indicate that the efficient supply of EVs to the detection site is effective in improving the sensitivity of EV detection, and that the EV supply rate is the rate-limiting factor for EV detection. The SF-PF microchip and the detection protocol proposed in this study are expected to serve as a guide for further development of EV detection methods. \n\nTo design a microchip that enables highly sensitive detection of EVs, we targeted the membrane antigen CD63, which is commonly found in EVs, especially exosomes, to capture and detect EVs. To establish a cancer point-of-care testing (POCT) using this microchip, it is necessary to specifically detect only EVs secreted by cancer cells in biological samples. For effective treatment, it is desirable to detect the cancer at an early stage. The concentration of EVs secreted by cancer cells was expected to be lower than the total EV concentration in the blood and the LOD in this study. Moreover, the viscosity of biological samples and foreign substances may reduce sensitivity. For these reasons, further improvements in the sensitivity of biological samples are necessary. This was addressed by considering the EV supply rate, which is clarified in this study. Suppression of nonspecific adsorption of EVs until they reach the detection region may contribute to the establishment of EV-based cancer POCT.",

            "text": "The results may have implications for the use of N-type and P-type PEC biosensors to detect different stages of ECCs. The P-type biosensor on the device surface has a higher response to GSH. These results agree well with existing studies when the surface of the material has a P-type Cu 2 O structure; that is, the higher the concentration of the GSH characteristic solution is, the higher the photocurrent will be. The relationship between concentration and photocurrent indicates a linear growth trend [53,54]. The N-type biosensor has a higher response to GSSG. When cancer cells become more severe, the measured photocurrent will increase [37]. Based on the results, the more severe the cancer is, the higher the photocurrent measured by the P-type sensor will be. Given that normal cells are subjected to oxidative stress, the DNA structure is gradually damaged under the attack of reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby changing the ratio of GSSG/GSH in normal cells. Thus, the invasion of ROS may cause more severe effects on the cells. When the concentration of GSSG increases, the photocurrent response detected decreases [55].\n\nIn future work, scholars should focus on particular aspects of tracking the primary tumor. A long-term follow-up of the study showed that the measured data will be archived into a large database, and a humanized display interface is designed through artificial intelligence. This tool can be used in the medical field to provide physicians with a generaloriented verification result. It may also provide doctors and patients with clear insights and help in intuitively understanding the diagnosis of cancer, particularly in esophageal cancer. Hopefully, it will be able to build a bridge for common communication between physicians and patients, and the vision of spreading cancer knowledge to the public and achieving prior detection and appropriate treatment will be just around the corner.

            "text": "In a recent market report, more than 100 companies were cited as providing CTC related products and services. 7 However, their operating principles and outputs are often at odds with the heterogeneous nature and complex properties of the cells of interest. 151 Each of these capture and detection methods has their advantages, and the disadvantages associated with the inherent properties of CTCs, as well as the challenging goal of capture and characterization. To account for this, engineering efforts may rely more on disciplines such as nanomaterials to exploit the wealth of technology already established. \n\nDuring the past two decades, the development of nanotechnology has yielded a variety of new nanoscale materials, including metal, metal oxide, semiconductor and polymeric nanomaterials with a wide range of applications in areas such as medicine, catalysis, electronics, and energy conversion and storage. 11 The enthusiasm for nanomaterials is based on their exceptional structural and functional properties that are typically different from either bulk materials or discrete molecules due to nanoscale effects. For example, gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) with near-infrared absorption show about one million times higher absorption coefficient than organic dye molecules, making them highly efficient photothermal agents for photoacoustic imaging and tumor ablation. For CTC capture and targeting, nanomaterials have begun to play an increasingly important role. \n\nIn recent years, nanomaterials have been intensively investigated for delivering therapeutic agents into solid tumors. The high permeability of tumor vasculature and the lack of proper lymphatic drainage result in the so-called enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect in the tumor microenvironment, which is believed to facilitate tumor delivery of nanoparticles and macromolecules that have the ability to circulate with a sufficiently long half-life. 135 However, nanoparticles must overcome multiple biological barriers before successfully reaching their intended disease sites. The tumor vascu- lature is highly heterogeneous in distribution and large areas of tumors may be poorly perfused. Impaired lymphatic drainage in tumors contributes to increased interstitial fluid pressure, adding a significant barrier to delivery. 15 High tumor cell density and dense tumor stroma can further thwart the movement of drugs within tumors.",

In addition to the peroxidase-like activity of g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets, the adsorption of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) was also found to improve the catalytic activity. The maximum reaction rate of the hydrogen peroxide-mediated 3,3 ,5,5 -tetramethylbenzidine reaction in the presence of ssDNA-g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets was at least four-fold faster than pure g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets. Considering this advantage, aptamer CD63 was introduced to specifically target EVs and generate variable catalytic ability (decrement) based on the varying concentrations (increment) of EVs. The EVs concentration was quantified by the color change of the product, and the LOD was calculated to be down to 13.52 \u00d7 10 5 EVs/mL. A similar signal trend was also observed from EVs collected from the sera samples. The developed system could also be used to characterize the differential expression of exosomal CD63 between the breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) and a control cell line (MCF-10A). Xia et al. quantified EVs based on aptamer-CD63-functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes (s-SWCNTs) [56].",

Gu et al. explored the application of graphene-based biosensors and bioimaging techniques for cancer diagnosis, focusing on the detection of specific cancer biomarkers. These biomarkers, including proteins, DNA, microRNA, and small molecules, can help identify cancer types and stages. For example, prostatespecific antigen (PSA) is usually used to diagnose prostate cancer, while breast cancer diagnosis often involves detecting specific genetic mutations like BRCA1 and BRCA2, as well as protein biomarkers such as CA 153, to determine the presence and progression of the disease. For liver cancer diagnosis, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is the primary biomarker used. Meanwhile, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), a protein heavily modified with sugar molecules, serves as a crucial biomarker for colorectal adenocarcinoma. Furthermore, certain metabolic byproducts, such as hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) and hydrogen ions (H + ), are valuable indicators of cancer progression, providing additional insights into the disease's development and advancement. 56 Due to its properties, including high-energy transfer efficiency, extensive surface area, and compatibility with living systems, graphene is an ideal material for enhancing optical sensors. These advanced sensors can accurately detect a wide range of samples, from cells and proteins to small molecules, with heightened sensitivity and precision. Wang, the inventor of a groundbreaking sensor, announced a pioneering achievement in utilizing pure graphene to develop a highly sensitive sensor with diverse applications. He emphasized that leveraging graphene alone enables the creation of a cost-effective, flexible, and photosensitive sensor. Wang attributed the sensor's success to its innovative trapped light nanostructures, which can retain light from electronic particles for extended periods, outperforming traditional sensors. This breakthrough capitalizes on graphene's exceptional optical properties, providing researchers with invaluable insights and building on the material's recent remarkable accomplishments. 57",

The particles can be applied for staining cells 5 and tissue 6 for fluorescence-based imaging techniques such as microscopy and tomography 7 . CPNs are hydrophobic, therefore, quickly taken up by cells and they exhibit low cytotoxicity 8 . Due to their \u03c0-conjugated electron system, these organic semiconductor particles are strongly fluorescent and the emission color can be tuned across the entire visible spectrum into the near infrared (NIR), simply by adjusting the co-monomer composition 9 . Furthermore, CPNs also show excellent performance as photoacoustic contrast agents and for image-guided photodynamic and photothermal therapy 7,10,11 . Because the entire CPN consists of semiconducting material, their fluorescence is extremely photostable, allowing detection over long observation times 5,12 . Furthermore, CPNs can be surface functionalized with biological recognition entities such as peptides 12 , glycans 13 , or antibodies 14 . Such surface functionalized nanoparticles are applied to specifically target bio-molecular motifs expressed on the membrane of cells in pathological tissue for example in cancerous tumors 15,16 . CPNs can be produced by a variety of methods ranging from dispersion polymerization protocols 12,[17][18][19][20][21] to post-polymerization miniemulsification 22,23 or nanoprecipitation techniques 5,24,25 . While direct polymerization methods deliver particles in the range of 200 to 2 \u00b5m, post-polymerization techniques can also produce much smaller nanoparticles (often termed dots) with diameters below 50 nm. However, with respect to in vivo and especially clinical applications the critical diameter for nanoparticles allowing for renal clearance is around 5-6 nm 26 . Particles in the blood stream above this size-limit will be ingested by macrophages eventually leading to accumulation in the spleen or liver 27 . If the particles cannot be degraded by macrophages, they will accumulate and persist in organs and might cause unforeseeable adverse effects 28 .",

            "text": "C onjugated polymer nanoparticles (CPNs) are compelling probes with prospective use in bio-medical imaging [1][2][3][4] . The particles can be applied for staining cells 5 and tissue 6 for fluorescence-based imaging techniques such as microscopy and tomography 7 . CPNs are hydrophobic, therefore, quickly taken up by cells and they exhibit low cytotoxicity 8 . Due to their \u03c0-conjugated electron system, these organic semiconductor particles are strongly fluorescent and the emission color can be tuned across the entire visible spectrum into the near infrared (NIR), simply by adjusting the co-monomer composition 9 . Furthermore, CPNs also show excellent performance as photoacoustic contrast agents and for image-guided photodynamic and photothermal therapy 7,10,11 . Because the entire CPN consists of semiconducting material, their fluorescence is extremely photostable, allowing detection over long observation times 5,12 . Furthermore, CPNs can be surface functionalized with biological recognition entities such as peptides 12 , glycans 13 , or antibodies 14 . Such surface functionalized nanoparticles are applied to specifically target bio-molecular motifs expressed on the membrane of cells in pathological tissue for example in cancerous tumors 15,16 . CPNs can be produced by a variety of methods ranging from dispersion polymerization protocols 12,[17][18][19][20][21] to post-polymerization miniemulsification 22,23 or nanoprecipitation techniques 5,24,25 . While direct polymerization methods deliver particles in the range of 200 to 2 \u00b5m, post-polymerization techniques can also produce much smaller nanoparticles (often termed dots) with diameters below 50 nm. However, with respect to in vivo and especially clinical applications the critical diameter for nanoparticles allowing for renal clearance is around 5-6 nm 26 . Particles in the blood stream above this size-limit will be ingested by macrophages eventually leading to accumulation in the spleen or liver 27 . If the particles cannot be degraded by macrophages, they will accumulate and persist in organs and might cause unforeseeable adverse effects 28 .",

            "text": "Today, cancer mortality is one of the most common causes of death. The application of nanotechnology in medicine includes six areas including 1) detection of molecular changes in diseases; 2) diagnosis and imaging; 3) drug delivery; 4) combined therapeutic and diagnostic applications; 5) report of therapeutic agent efficacy; and 6) nanotechnology applications in scientific discovery and basic research (56). A variety of nanostructures from organic and inorganic materials have been recently used for cancer therapy and diagnosis in passive or active tumor targeting. A novel formulation of nanovesicles, liposomes, polymeric micelles, dendrimers, and polymeric nanoparticles can enter into the solid tumor site through the porous structure of a tumor vascular system, and then, selectively deliver the therapeutic agents (57,58). Nanomaterials with proper targeting ligands could bind to antigens or receptors on the target cells. However, this powerful technology leads to a decreased toxicity in non-targeted cells, and therefore, the distribution of nanomaterials will be increased in the target cells (59). Some of the nanomaterials shown in Table 2 (60-73) such as semiconducting nanoparticles or quantum dots (QDs), colloidal nanoparticles, dendrimers, magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), carbon-based nanomaterials (CBNs), and liposomal nanoparticles systems have been constructed for utilization in therapeutic applications. Quantum dots (QDs) are semiconducting nanoparticles with the diameter ranging from 2\u223c10 nm, narrow emission and broad absorption profile, high photostability, long fluorescence lifespan, ability to be conjugated with proteins (74). Also, QDs have the potential of applications in molecular and cellular labelling, cell tracking, drug delivery and also, cancer detection and therapy (75,76). Dendrimers are highly branched synthetic polymers (about 1.5\u223c13.5 nm) (77,78) that have attracted considerable attention because of their hyper-branched structure, monodispersity, functional surface groups, and symmetrical conformation (79).",

PTT agents can enhance the efficiency of localized light-based heating and ablation of tumor tissues and, at the same time, reduce adverse effects. \n\nHigh-performance photo-converted energy-converting biomaterials (H-ECBs) produce heat to kill specific cells, not requiring oxygen to interact with the target cells or tissues, as in photodynamic therapy. The longer the light wavelength, the less energetic and less harmful to healthy cells and tissues surrounding the tumors [34]. Once irradiated, the PTT agents absorb photons' energy, migrating from the ground singlet state to an excited singlet state. As it returns to the ground state, the so-called vibrational relaxation promotes collisions between the excited PPT agents which, in turn, collide with molecules surrounding their microenvironment. As a result, the temperature increases due to the increased kinetic energy [30]. Critical conditions for PTT success are the adequate spectral range, attaining the peak absorption wavelength of the photosensitive agent used in the treatment, and the tissue-penetration depth that can reach the target while reducing the power loss to a minimum [30].",

Therefore, several aspects related to the in-situ polymerization, and more specifically to the electrosynthesis of MIPs and hybrid technologies involving MIPs in the fabrication of biosensors, as well as their most recent advances in addressing two important challenges for MIP-based electrochemical biosensors, the determination of biomacromolecules and enantiospecific analysis, will be very briefly presented.\n\nElectroactive organic functional monomers can polymerize to form conducting, semiconducting or insulating polymers. Polymerization may be performed chemically (using an oxidizer as external reagent) or electrochemically (by electropolymerization). Electropolymerization is the more convenient approach, in terms of simplicity and time-effectiveness, for electrochemical biosensor fabrication as it leads to a tight binding of an MIP film onto the surface of the transducer. This procedure ensures both the synthesis and the surface immobilization of the biomimetic layer, along with the possibility of controlling polymer nucleation and growth, film thickness and morphology by the proper selection of the electropolymerization parameters.

            "text": "There has been widespread interest in the development of electrochemical sensors and biosensors for the selective detection of different analytes, both in vitro and in vivo. This includes their integration into wearable [1,2] or implantable [3,4] platforms, due to their high sensitivities, low detection limits, modifiable electrode architectures, and ready integration, with control and analysis instrumentation along with minimal sample requirements. However, when an implanted device needs to be used for long periods of time, biofouling often causes the sensor transducer (functionalised electrode) surface to become passivated by fibrous capsules and non-specific proteins [5]. This foreign-body response remains a major issue to be addressed for implantable electrochemical sensing devices as it significantly limits their lifetime and compromises their response [6]. Indeed, if implanted biomaterials/devices are not suitably designed or protected, potential risks related to the foreign body response include capsule formation, prolonged inflammation, haemorrhage, tissue oedema, fibrosis, synovitis, thrombosis, restenosis and organ failure [7]. Accordingly, there is growing interest in avoiding or blocking biofouling through minimising the size of the sensor, reducing material-tissue interactions and/or protecting these implantable sensing systems from tissue exposure. This includes a variety of approaches based on polymers, including hydrogels, SAMs, MEMS and even fluidic systems [8][9][10]. \n\nPolymers have been widely used in medical devices and implants due to their readily controllable chemical, electrical and thermal properties [11] and due to their biocompatibility, unlike alternatives such as metals and ceramics typically used in sensors. These polymers can also be made as soft materials with attractive physical properties due to their controllable Young's moduli and fabricated readily into a variety of sizes and shapes on demand [12]. Different classes of polymers have been coated onto electrode surfaces to minimise biofouling, through reducing the interactions between the electrode surface and proteins/cells [13].",

In this section, we will discuss the clinical applications of nanotechnology in cancer diagnosis and imaging. \n\nEarly cancer detection is critical for successful treatment and increased survival rates. NPs can assist in early cancer detection by enabling targeted imaging of small tumors that are difficult to detect with conventional imaging techniques (Biju, 2014). NPs can be engineered to accumulate in tumor tissues, allowing for highly sensitive and precise imaging of cancerous cells. For example, iron oxide NPs can be functionalized with specific targeting ligands that bind to tumor cells (Mahmoudi et al., 2011). These NPs can then be used as contrast agents in MRI to detect tumors at an early stage. \n\nNPs can also be used to track the effectiveness of cancer therapy (Chen et al., 2019). The accumulation of nanoparticles in tumors over time can be observed using imaging methods like positron emission tomography (PET), CT, and MRI, providing information on treatment efficacy. This approach, known as molecular imaging, can provide clinicians with real-time information on tumor response to therapy, allowing them to adjust treatment regimens accordingly (Kircher et al., 2012). For instance, polymeric NPs can be loaded with chemotherapy drugs and functionalized with targeting ligands. These NPs can then be used to track drug accumulation in tumors over time, providing data on drug efficacy and toxicity. Furthermore, iron oxide NPs can be used as MRI contrast agents to monitor changes in tumor size and shape during treatment (Wabler et al., 2014). \n\nNPs can also be used to guide tumor resection surgery. Fluorescence imaging and MRI can visualize NP accumulation in tumors, allowing for precise surgical resection of cancerous tissues. NPs can be functionalized with fluorescent dyes or radioisotopes to visualize tumor margins during surgery. This method, known as image-guided surgery, can improve tumor resection accuracy while reducing the risk of recurrence (Nagaya et al., 2017). \n\nNPs can also be used to develop personalized cancer treatment approaches.",

            "text": "Background The immune system interacts with cancer cells in various intricate ways that can protect the individual from overproliferation of cancer cells; however, these interactions can also lead to malignancy. There has been a dramatic increase in the application of cancer immunotherapy in the last decade. However, low immunogenicity, poor specificity, weak presentation efficiency, and off-target side effects still limit its widespread application. Fortunately, advanced biomaterials effectively contribute immunotherapy and play an important role in cancer treatment, making it a research hotspot in the biomedical field. Main body This review discusses immunotherapies and the development of related biomaterials for application in the field. The review first summarizes the various types of tumor immunotherapy applicable in clinical practice as well as their underlying mechanisms. Further, it focuses on the types of biomaterials applied in immunotherapy and related research on metal nanomaterials, silicon nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes, polymer nanoparticles, and cell membrane nanocarriers. Moreover, we introduce the preparation and processing technologies of these biomaterials (liposomes, microspheres, microneedles, and hydrogels) and summarize their mechanisms when applied to tumor immunotherapy. Finally, we discuss future advancements and shortcomings related to the application of biomaterials in tumor immunotherapy. Conclusion Research on biomaterial-based tumor immunotherapy is booming; however, several challenges remain to be overcome to transition from experimental research to clinical application. Biomaterials have been optimized continuously and nanotechnology has achieved continuous progression, ensuring the development of more efficient biomaterials, thereby providing a platform and opportunity for breakthroughs in tumor immunotherapy.

            "text": "Precise and efficient delivery of nanomedicine to the target site has remained as a major roadblock in advanced cancer treatment. Here, a novel photoacoustic force (PAF)\u2010guided nanotherapeutic system is reported based on a near\u2010infrared (NIR)\u2010absorbing semiconducting polymer (SP), showing significantly improved tumor accumulation and deep tissue penetration for enhanced phototherapeutic efficacy. The accumulation of nanoparticles in 4T1 tumor\u2010bearing mice induced by the PAF strategy displays a fivefold enhancement in comparison with that of the traditional passive targeting pathway, in a significantly shortened time (45 min vs 24 h) with an enhanced penetration depth in tumors. Additionally, a tumor\u2010bearing mouse model is rationally designed to unveil the mechanism, indicating that the nanoparticles enter solid tumors through enhanced transportation across blood vessel barriers via both inter\u2010endothelial gaps and active trans\u2010endothelial pathways. This process is specifically driven by PAF generated from the nanoparticles under NIR laser irradiation. The study thus demonstrates a new nanotherapeutic strategy with low dose, enhanced delivery efficiency in tumor, and boosted therapeutic efficacy, opening new doors for designing novel nanocarriers.",

In electrophysiological signals, OECTs are used both as the recording and stimulation devices (Williamson et al., 2015;Braendlein et al., 2017a). OECTs can also be applied to measure cell coverage (Lin et al., 2010), barrier tissue arrangement and cellular environment for non-electrogenic epithelial cells (Jimison et al., 2012;Yao et al., 2013;Ramuz et al., 2015;Romeo et al., 2015). Assessment protocols have been established, applying white noise at the gate (Rivnay et al., 2015b), showing that OECTs have better performance comparing with impedance sensing (Rivnay et al., 2015b,c). The ability to work in complicated environments, such as blood and milk, paves the way for multi-analyte assay in complex environments (Tria et al., 2014). As for OECT-based biosensors, the detection of metabolites in electrolytes or body fluid are valuable for early prediction of human disease (Zhu et al., 2004;Macaya et al., 2007;Bernards et al., 2008). OECTs were easily to be coupled with various fabrication techniques (ElMahmoudy et al., 2017), resulting in different formative factors with flexible and wearable applications (Fan et al., 2018;Yang et al., 2018).

            "text": "Due to the distinct morphological features of EVs and the diverse cargo they contain, a wide range of methods can be used to detect them. These include but are not limited to: electron microscopy, flow cytometry, immunoassays, digital droplet PCR, and sequencing [144]. Despite the challenges involved with obtaining pure EVs from plasma or other bodily fluids, they are particularly stable and, due to the variety of their cargo, facilitate more complex profiling of the tumours from which they are released. Thus, EVs could potentially offer some advantages over CTCs and ctDNA-based methods of cancer detection. Some recent studies have illustrated the potential utility of EV-based assays for early cancer detection. In a case-control study, EVs were isolated from the plasma of cancer patients using a novel integrative device and then detected by a multiplex immunoassay based on 42 EV-associated proteins [145]. Strikingly, the platform could detect stage I pancreatic (96%) and ovarian cancer (74%) at high sensitivity, with a specificity of 99.5% across all cancers tested (AUC = 0.95). In addition, another study developed a model to classify early-stage lung cancer based on the differential expression of long RNAs contained in EVs [146]. This approach detected early-stage lung adenocarcinoma at a sensitivity and specificity of 93.75% and 85.71%, distinguishing it from pulmonary infection and benign lung nodules (AUC = 0.918). Together, these results highlight the potential of tumour-derived EVs in the early detection of 'less survivable' cancers.",

Circulating tumor cells that carry the most complete information of neoplastic lesions are analytes of interest for sensor designer. To overcome the deficiencies in the use of antibodies, some antibody-like structures were used to integrate chemosensors, such as molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) and aptamer conjugates that may perform specific detection of analytes. The sensors inherited from such structurally stable molecular recognition materials have the advantage of being cost-effective, rapid-to-fabricate and easy-to-use, whilst exhibiting specificity comparable to antibody-based kits. Moreover, the fabricated sensors may automatically perform quantitative analysis via digital and microfluidic devices, facilitating advances in wearable sensors, meanwhile bringing new opportunities and challenges. Although most MIPs-based sensors for tumor diagnosis to date have not been practically used in hospitals, with no doubt, material innovation and artificial intelligence development are the driving forces to push the process forward. At the same time, the challenges and opportunities of these sensors moving forward to intelligent and implantable devices are discussed.",

For this reason, they are used combined with other nanostructures, such as GN, CNTs, C60, conductive polymers, obtaining remarkable synergistic effects [31]. \n\nFor instance, in 2019 Fan et al. [20] realized a paper-based immunosensor for the detection of cancer antigen 125 (CA125), by modifying the working electrode with reduced GN/thionine/AuNPs nanocomposites where anti-CA125 was immobilized. GN's nanoporous structure combined with AuNPs provided a significant signal enhancement with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.01 U mL-1. \n\nMoreover, in 2020 Suresh et al. [23] developed a sandwich-type enzymatic immunosensor to detect prostate cancer. A nanocomposite film constituted by polyaniline (PANI), C60 and PtNPs was used to modify the glassy carbon (GC) electrode surface, allowing the Ab immobilization. After incubation with the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and the Ab2 marked with horseradish peroxidase, the H2O2 reduction signal was significantly enhanced, with a LOD for PSA of 1.95 \u00d7 10 \u22125 ng mL \u22121 . The MeNPs size plays an essential role in the ET efficiency and in 1995 Doron et al. developed an interesting proofof-concept study [32]. They prepared AuNPs films on indium tin oxide (ITO) surfaces functionalized with (aminopropyl)siloxane or (mercaptopropyl)siloxane. Different sizes of AuNPs were used in the range between 25 nm and 120 nm. They saw that smaller nanoparticles gave better surface coverage and more homogeneous films than the bigger ones. This result was reflected in the voltammetric response of a redox mediator, 8-(Nmethyl-4,4\u2032-bipyridinyl)octanoic acid, covalently linked to a cystamine monolayer formed onto the AuNPs films.",

The effect of SiNP length on capture was tested, resulting in speculation that the optimized lengths corresponded to lengths amenable to interaction with extracellular structures. These researchers having optimized the substrate with MCF-7 cells spiked into whole blood, a SiNP surface was used in conjunction with a chaotic micromixer for both cell line and patient sample CTC capture (Figure 9a). 91 The results from patient sampling were compared with CellSearch analysis, and showed a marked improvement over this established method, detecting CTCs in 20 out of 26 patients, while CellSearch found CTCs in only 8 of those patients. Using a chemically etched silicon nanostructured surface with similar dimensions under the name silicon nanowires (SiNW), Hou et al. were able to conjugate a temperature sensitive polymer, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PIPAAm), to the high surface area substrate, designated SiNWS, allowing for controlled release of captured CTCs. 92 Further conjugated with anti-EpCAM antibodies, the functionalized SiNWS-bound PIPAAm facilitated cell capture at a ratio of over 70% of labeled MCF-7 cells spiked into blood and 90% cell release for 1000 MCF-7 cells/mL with 90% viability.\n\nThe role of the antibody as a capture moiety may be assumed by DNA aptamers. These aptamers were conjugated to the elements of a silicon nanowire array (SiNWA) to isolate CD4\u00fe T lymphocytes (Figure 9b). 93 In addition to showing increased specificity as a result of both the aptamers and the nanostructured surface, the application of exonuclease I allowed for the release of 97% of captured cells with 90% viability. A similar method of rare cell capture and release via DNA aptamers of cancer cells was put forth as an update to the NanoVelcro Chip (Figure 9c). 94 This device was validated using the non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell line A549, and release was conducted with the enzyme Benzonase Nuclease",

            "text": "Biosensors assembled from synthetic and natural polymers for cancer detection show several limitations and weaknesses. One significant issue is stability; both types of polymers can degrade over time, which adversely affects the biosensor's execution and reliability. The polymer matrix can be sensitively affected by environmental factors such as temperature, pH, or humidity, which can lead to instability of the biosensor. 178 urthermore, many biosensors have a restricted lifetime due to the instability of the biorecognition elements, forcing frequent replacements. An alternative concern is the capability for crossreactivity, where nonspecific binding with other biomolecules may result in false positives, thus dropping the specificity of the polymer-based biosensor. Increasing production costs due to the complexity of fabrication and functionalization of polymerbased biosensors can be involved and may need procedures and techniques. Likewise, natural polymers might be more sensitive to environmental considerations, such as microbial contamination, that can compromise their performance. \n\nCombining polymer-based biosensors with existing recognition approaches can also be challenging, requiring further optimization. 179 Adjusting agreements for new biosensor technologies is often a complex and lengthy process that can hinder their presence in the market. Scalability exhibits another challenge, as scaling up manufacture while keeping quality and performance can be challenging.",

            "text": "Conductive polymers have similar electrical and optical characteristics to inorganic semiconductors and metals, as well as the desirable qualities associated with traditional polymers, such as ease of processing and synthesis [168]. These materials have a multitude of applicability in the field of microelectronics, such as light-emitting diodes, batteries, electrochromic displays, and photovoltaics. Recently these polymers are also being utilized in the biomedical field. Research of conductive polymers in the biomedical field significantly increased in the 1980s when it was discovered that these materials were suitable for many biomolecules, including those employed in biosensors. The ability of CPs to alter biological processes, such as DNA synthesis, protein release, cell adhesion, and migration, through electrical stimulation had already been established by the mid-1990s [169][170][171][172]. Numerous research papers focused on electrically responsive cells, such as those in the heart, bone, muscle, and nerve. The majority of CPs offer several key benefits for biomedical applications, such as the capacity to encapsulate and release biological molecules under controlled conditions (also known as reversible doping), biocompatibility, the potential charge transfer from a biochemical reaction, and the capability to modify the physical, chemical, electrical, and other characteristics of the conducting polymers, to better suit the needs of the particular application. Numerous biological applications, including drug-delivery systems, bio-actuators, biosensors, neural probes, and tissue-engineering scaffolds, benefit from these distinctive properties (Table 3) [135]. \n\nIn addition to CPs, other electroactive materials have been employed in biological applications [16]. For instance, nerve conduits have been developed utilizing electrets and piezoelectric materials, which generate transitory electrical charges in response to mechanical deformation. Sensors and neural probes are manufactured using metals and semiconductors, for example, silicon, iridium, and gold. However, compared to these materials, CPs have a multitude of benefits. Comparatively, CPs are less expensive, easier to fabricate, and more adaptable because of the wide variety of compounds that can be either entrapped in them or employed as dopants, easily altering their properties.",

            "text": "Unlike two-dimensional graphene, GQDs have a band gap because of quantum size effect and exhibit stable and size-dependent photoluminescence, which can be tuned during their synthesis, by controlling their size shape, doping with heteroatoms and the charge transfers between functional groups and the graphene surface [26,27]. GQDs have been loaded with drugs and tumor-targeting ligand units able to specifically recognize cancer receptors exposed on the cell surface by generating new therapies for efficient targeted delivery of anticancer agents as well as the development of new imaging agents for the in vitro and in vivo diagnosis of several types of cancer [28,29]. Due to their intrinsic optical properties, GQDs have been designed for application in photovoltaics, electro/photo/chemical catalysis, fabrication of flexible devices and biosensing [30]. Recent literature data report the use of GQDs functionalized with functional groups or biomolecules able to recognize cancer biomarkers or to detect tumor cells, as sensing elements for the selective early detection diagnosis of cancer (Figure 1). The aim of this review is to report an overview of the recent advances, in the development of different classes of biosensors based on GQDs, for the cancer diagnosis, focusing the attention on the ideal properties of GQDs for biosensing and taking into account the methods used for their synthesis and functionalization procedures, and their possible use in clinics for the diagnosis and management of cancer.",

            "text": "While GSPEs do not have the advantage of being disposable, they are designed to be reusable and withstand rigorous cleaning procedures. These characteristics could be beneficial in preventing interference from electrode fouling, allowing the same electrode to be used for multiple measurements. \n\nOur results show that the adsorption and polymerization of PAP complicate its use in assay development. Utilizing a self-assembled monolayer to prevent PAP adsorption reduced the electrochemical oxidation current, confirming that adsorption is required for signal output at the concentrations used. Relying on PAP's adsorption to obtain signal resulted in widely variable signals across both CSPEs and GSPEs due to inconsistent adsorption to the different surface morphologies of electrodes. The GSPEs showed considerable variability in peak currents even when using the same electrode and cleaning between scans. Concentrations of 25 \u00b5M PAP were initially investigated as higher concentrations would allow for an extended linear range of detection. However, the adsorption issues of PAP can be mitigated using lower concentrations of PAP. Limiting PAP production in immunoassays is necessary to ensure the reproducibility of PAP oxidation and assay measurements. Multiple, subsequent measurements on one electrode resulted in the polymerization of PAP on both CSPEs and GSPEs, preventing this system from being useful for continuous monitoring. \n\nPolarization modulation-infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (PM-IRRAS) and Raman spectroscopy were used to characterize and distinguish between adsorbed and polymerized PAP. Previous groups have characterized the PAP monomer, PAP polymer, and PAP films using infrared spectroscopy [8,9,11,13], consistent with our PM-IRRAS of adsorbed and polymerized PAP. Using Raman spectroscopy, other groups have characterized the PAP monomer [20] and a PAP radical cation [21]. However, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to report a Raman spectrum of the PAP polymer. The PM-IRRAS and Raman spectra confirmed the presence of adsorbed PAP and PAP polymer on the gold's surface and provided a distinction between the two species.",

            "text": "While strategies to remodel the TME have enticing advantages, they wield a double-edged sword. For instance, while disrupting the tumor ECM facilitates the deep penetration and perfusion of nanoDDS in solid tumors, it may inadvertently provide impetus to tumor metastasis. Similarly, while elevated ROS levels effectively inhibit tumor progression and enhance immunotherapy efficacy, they may also promote genetic mutations, cell proliferation, and angiogenesis, ultimately fostering tumor invasion and metastasis. Moreover, despite its potential to increase blood perfusion and alleviate tumor hypoxia, the normalization of tumor vasculature introduces a paradox by potentially reducing the permeability to large particles through the ERP effects. As we navigate the intricate landscape of cancer therapeutics, it becomes clear that achieving victory in the fight against cancer requires a keen understanding of the TME's complexity and the design of efficient and comprehensive biomaterials. \n\nHowever, the clinical application of biomaterials presents challenges that must be addressed. Ensuring safety, large-scale manufacturing, batch quality control, and long-term stability are crucial hurdles that must be overcome to enhance the clinical potential of biomaterials. The design and preparation of biomaterials must adhere to stringent controls to guarantee both safety and effectiveness, with consideration given to mitigating unnecessary side effects associated with immunogenicity. \n\nUsing biocompatible synthetic biomaterials with low and toxicity, such as liposomes, LNPs, degradable polymer NPs, and microneedles, is promising. Finally, transitioning biomaterials from laboratory to clinical settings necessitates addressing regulatory and quality-control challenges. Natural biomaterials, such as extracellular vesicles, HA, chitosan, and collagen, face the complex task of balancing their functionality, large-scale production, and quality control to unlock their clinical potential. Overall, using biomaterials in immunotherapy is promising and can overcome some limitations of immunotherapy, however, its own limitations must be overcome to ensure safe and effective clinical application.",

            "text": "Although recent evidence suggests that pre-metastatic niche models enable the early detection and treatment of metastatic disease 27 , open questions remain regarding the efficacy of these platforms when compared to other emerging metastasis detection technologies. Additional technologies for metastasis detection include exosome detection and CTC enumeration (Table 3). Both platforms are part of a larger initiative to utilize liquid biopsies to gain more information about a patient's disease state, evolving molecular features, and response to therapy 118,124 . Advantages to liquid biopsy strategies for detection include the ease of sample collection and ability to collect multiple samples over the course of a patient's treatment. While liquid biopsies have shown promise in these areas, they also have distinct disadvantages that could potentially be circumvented by pre-metastatic niche mimics. For example, exosome detection is likely to be less sensitive than CTC detection due to exosome heterogeneity and their presence in large numbers also in healthy patients 68,125 . Similarly, the presence of CTCs indicates the risk for metastasis but does not indicate the presence of permissive microenvironments in organs for these cells to home and colonize. These considerations show specific advantages for the use of pre-metastatic niche mimics (Table 3), however, there are also potential issues associated with the clinical use of these devices, such as the overall safety of creating a site for metastatic cells to home that will need to be evaluated thoroughly in clinical trials. Future methods may provide complementary implementations of these techniques to provide a more comprehensive evaluation on the metastatic state of a patient. \n\nIn a clinical setting, the choice of material (Table 2) is critical for designing a functional implantable device for recruiting and detecting metastatic cells. For example, materials such as PLG are susceptible to hydrolytic degradation, thus limiting the amount of time the material can remain in a patient. The scaffold should ideally maintain its structure for several months during a patient's treatment, given that metastasis may occur on a timescale from months to years 126 . Polymer scaffold degradation is usually desired for tissue engineering applications where host cells eventually replace the material, but degradation is likely undesirable for long-term implantable metastatic detectors.",

            "text": "Tumor cells employ various mechanisms, including establishing an immunosuppressive microenvironment, inhibiting immune cells, hypoxia, and acidification to evade immune system attacks. Collectively, these factors hamper the activity and infiltration of immune cells, thereby diminishing the effectiveness of the treatment. The TME has emerged as a critical target for shaping tumor responses to immunotherapy, and modulating the TME has the potential to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy. Specifically, through the strategic utilization of compatible biomaterial platforms, therapeutic drugs or materials with TME-modulating properties can be designed to complement immunotherapy, mitigate immunosuppression within the TME, and improve immune-cell infiltration and function. \n\nBiomaterials, propelled by continuous advancements in materials science and delivery technologies, are poised to significantly impact the targeting of TMEs. Biomaterials offer distinct advantages over individual immunotherapies, as they enhance drug delivery efficiency and bolster anti-tumor effects while mitigating side effects. Their applications extend to the development of cancer vaccines, T-cell amplification, T-cell regulation, and management of immunosuppressive TMEs. By engineering biomaterials with tailored biological activity, biocompatibility, and degradability, it is possible to guide, modulate, and fortify immunotherapy within the TME. One integral strategy involves the delivery of immune modulators and drugs via biomaterials. The synergistic pairing of immune checkpoint inhibitors with biomaterial carriers amplifies drug infiltration and release within tumors, ultimately improving immunotherapy efficacy. Moreover, biomaterials serve as valuable tools for normalizing tumor blood vessels, enhancing drug permeability, promoting immune cell infiltration, and reducing hypoxia, all of which contribute to improved immunotherapy effectiveness. Additionally, biomaterials disrupt the ECM of tumor cells, breaking down barriers to drug delivery and consequently enhancing treatment efficacy. \n\nWhile strategies to remodel the TME have enticing advantages, they wield a double-edged sword.",

            "text": "From semiconducting inorganic compounds (groups III-V, Si, etc.), transition element oxides (BiVO 4 , Fe 2 O 3 , TiO 2 , and Cu 2 O), sulfides (NiS and CdS), acacinitrides (BaNbO 2 N), and chalcogenides that are prepared under controlled nanoscale morphologies are the most used materials for this purpose [12][13][14][15]. \n\nThe preparation of photoelectrodes from polymers is less complex and more suitable for the production of large-scale devices than electrodes based on inorganic materials only. A distinctive property of polymers is that the positions of the bonds can be easily adjusted, unlike inorganic ones. Moreover, polymeric photoelectrodes have high optical absorption. Recently, metal oxide/polymer nanocomposites have demonstrated promising behavior for light detection due to its attractive photocatalytic properties, which combine the optical properties of the composite materials [16]. \n\nAs 2 O 3 is indeed a highly stable oxide that is recommended for application within various devices involved in light sensing and current control. Its exceptional stability allows it to exhibit light absorbance across a wide optical region, enabling the capture of a significant number of photons within this range [17]. This absorbance property makes As 2 O 3 suitable for capturing and detecting energy photons, thus making it ideal for a range of optoelectronic applications and energy conversion development [18]. \n\nThe high light absorbance exhibited by As 2 O 3 when subjected to incident illumination further enhances its light-sensing capabilities. This characteristic is expected to enables the material to effectively sense and measure the number of photons in different optical regions during its application as a photoelectrode. Consequently, As 2 O 3 demonstrates a fast response to light, allowing for quick detection and response times, which is advantageous for applications that require rapid light capture. \n\nWhile As 2 O 3 exhibits semiconducting properties, it is expected to have a small or negligible dark current (J o ) value. This implies that the ratio of the desired signal to unwanted noise, known as the signal-to-noise ratio, is highly promising in photodetectors based on As 2 O 3 .",

Li et al. developed a field-transistor biosensor using polymer-sorted semiconducting CNT films to detect exosomal miRNA with high sensitivity for breast cancer detection [115]. Because of photoluminescence, Raman scattering, photoacoustic, and echogenic properties, CNTs have been investigated for tracking and bioimaging in biological environments [119]. Singh et al. fabricated MWCNTs by the pyrolysis of a chickpea peel precursor. These MWCNTs showed blue fluorescence signals in human prostate carcinoma cells without cytotoxicity [116]. The application of CNTs has been demonstrated to deliver drugs of low solubility and low bioavailability to the target site via enhanced cellular permeation [117]. Suo et al. functionalized MWCNTs with a layer of the phospholipid-poly(ethylene glycol) and anti-Pgp antibodies to improve the biocompatibility, blood circulation, and ability to target cancer cells. In this work, they showed the effectiveness of the phospholipid-PEG-coated MWCNTs functionalized with anti-Pgp antibodies in generating phototoxicity in cancer cells under photoirradiation without damaging normal cells [118].

            "text": "Sonosensitizers inherently require an adequate supply of oxygen to generate sufficient ROS, but the interior hypovascular solid tumors often encounter hypoxia and thus inevitably decrease the therapeutic efficacy of SDT. [11] ncorporation of in situ oxygen-generating materials such as enzymes [11a] or oxygen carriers such as hemoglobin [11b] and perfluorocarbon [12] into sonosensitizers to increase tumor oxygenation is a regulatory strategy to reduce the tolerance of hypoxic tumors to SDT. However, the penetration ability of sonosensitizers in solid tumors has rarely been evaluated. Especially in large solid tumors with hypopermeable characteristics, the penetration ability of sonosensitizers is a vital factor, since the ROS generated by sonosensitizers only induce nearby tumor cell apoptosis. [13] herefore, a new sonodynamic therapeutic system is urgently needed to synergistically enhance tumor penetration and alleviate tumor hypoxia in a large tumor model. \n\nAs an emerging category of organic theranostic agents, semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) transformed from highly -electron delocalized semiconducting polymers have high biocompatibility, high chemical flexibility, and tunable sizes. [14] To date, SPNs have been explored for a series of biomedical applications including optical imaging, [15] phototherapy, [16] and biological regulation. [17] However, the sonodynamic therapeutic effect of SPNs as sonosensitizers for cancer therapy has yet to be exploited. \n\nIn this study, we report the synthesis of US excitable semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (termed as SPNC) that can synergistically overcome both poor penetration and hypoxia in large solid tumors for enhanced SDT. SPNC is composed of a semiconducting polymer nanoparticle core as a sonodynamic converter, conjugated with an oxygen-modulating enzyme, catalase, via a coupling reaction between the amino group of catalase and the carboxyl group of SPN (Figure 1a).",

            "text": "Over the last few years, EC sensors have been integrated in OoC models to allow real-time monitoring of cell migration, pH and O 2 , as well as for the detection of rare cells and even for drug screening applications. The future directions for sensorised 3D cell culture systems based on electrochemistry are focused on the development of new functional polymer hydrogels and microfabrication techniques. For example, one-step electrospinning techniques enable functional entities to be presented on nanofiber surfaces during the process to fabricate scaffolds. Therefore, electrodes presented in nanofiber form in the scaffold can interface directly with the cells growing on its surfaces. However, the main challenge for these functional biomaterials is to meet the stringent requirements for cell and biological compatibility. On the other hand, biosensing platforms integrated with electrochemical electrodes to isolate and detect cancer cells from biological fluids have been reported to be extremely effective and able to address challenges and requirements related with this complex task. Sensing elements incorporated in 2D cultures and 3D scaffolds have been successfully realized, offering electrochemical ways for improving micro-scale understanding of cell culture microenvironment, and will facilitate advanced organ-on-chip studies in the future. \n\nThe trends in this field are clearly moving towards increasing abilities for the detection and development of precision clinical testing devices that can be personalised for efficient cancer diagnosis and treatment selection. Electrochemical transduction strategies stand as a competitive candidate for reliable label-free and multi-analyte detection in the future. However, selectivity and quantitative evaluation is still an unsolved puzzle, which needs to be ensured to be able to provide the high standards needed by the clinical diagnostic sector.",

            "text": "Histopathological studies (see Fig. 17) revealed a considerable anticancer therapeutic potential of nanoconstruct in terms of decreased focal epidermal thickness, presence of degenerative sites, and decreased extent of hyperkeratosis in 5-FU/+NS*CS@Ag NPs (5-FU-loaded and nisin-conjugated CScoated silver NPs) treated tumor group as compared to untreated tumor group. It is important not to overlook the potential anticancer benefits of CS. In fact, it may have indirectly contributed to more significant anticancer effects at lower doses. This could be due to the increased efficacy of nanoconstructs in targeting cancerous cells. As a result, it is possible to achieve stronger anticancer effects with lower doses of the drugs (Rana et al., 2022). \n\nIt is essential to have a suitable surface coating to avoid the aggregation of NPs and to improve drug loading and targeting. Coating magnetic NPs with a natural biodegradable polymer like CS can effectively prevent the formation of clusters in the bloodstream. This ensures that the NPs remain separate and do not agglomerate, providing an efficient and safe solution. Delivering hydrophobic drugs safely to the tumor site remains a significant challenge for the scientific community. Manjusha et al. have developed a novel PTX/CS@IONPs~METAC (PTXloaded, CS-coated iron oxide NPs, cross-linked by (methacryloyloxy) ethyl] trimethyl ammonium chloride polymer) to improve the in vivo efficacy of hydrophobic drugs by avoiding solubility concerns. The recently developed polymeric material is highly effective in delivering PTX in a controlled and targeted manner. This material has demonstrated remarkable anticancer properties, good hemocompatibility, and a favorable pharmacokinetics profile (Manjusha et al., 2023). \n\nFunctional groups on an NP can form covalent bonds with CS molecules through various reactions, either before or after NP formation. The specific method of synthesis and chemical properties of the materials used will determine the optimal reaction pathway (Del Prado-Audelo et al., 2020).",

            "text": ", which depends on the amount of immobilized antibodies and the antibodyeantigen interaction [21].\n\nConducting polymers (CPs) are among the best materials for constructing biosensors [22]. CPs are unique materials because they are organic chains that have conjugated double bonds in the structure. In conjugation, the bonds between the carbon atoms alternate between single and double, giving the polymer semiconducting properties [23,24]. The use of CPs in biosensors has advantages such as greater sensitivity, improved conductivity, lower detection limits, cost-benefit, stability, and biocompatibility [23,24]. Polypyrrole (PPy) is one of the most used polymers in biosensor development due to its stability, biocompatibility, electrical conductivity, and good redox properties [25]. Furthermore, due to the important and attractive redox characteristics, the use of a redox probe in the electrolyte is unnecessary since the polymer presents Faradaic reactions [26]. Also, the electrochemical response can be enhanced by using nanostructures due to the larger sensor surface area, which increases sensitivity and selectivity and facilitates the charge transfer processes [27]. PPy is also promising for commercial applications due to greater environmental stability, ease of synthesis, and conductivity than other CPs [28].\n\nBioreceptor immobilization on the electrode is a crucial step in biosensor fabrication, success in this step ensures biosensor stability and sensitivity [22]. To create a new biosensor that can meet the current challenges, the points that must be considered include changing the surface chemistry for immobilization, improving detection limit and selectivity for better detection, and enabling data processing and analysis. Furthermore, many researchers have focused on increasing the sensitivity and sensing range of biosensors using semiconductor and metallic materials [29]. Immobilization of proteins via histidine-tag (His-tag) is an interesting and accessible method for immobilization since it focuses on protein orientation. The His-tag position on the protein can be controlled by genetic engineering, resulting in protein uniform orientation during immobilization [30,31]. His-tag proteins have a high affinity for bivalent transition",

The results provide a useful reference for more studies to optimize such formulations in more preclinical studies for clinical translation, including optimizing concentrations of nanoparticles and immunoadjuvants. The combination of chitosan and alginate polymers increase cross linkages for denser structure (19) (20). Other benefits of using sodium alginate an d c hitosan polyme rs are due to their biocompatibility, non-toxicity, low cost, and a simple transition into a functional biomaterial among other profits (21,22). \n\nThe approach to incorporate nanoparticles optimized for IGRT and sustained delivery of immunoadjuvants represents a promising direction for innovation including towards making the tumor microenvironment more immunogenic. LIFE radiotherapy biomaterials incorporating immunoadjuvants proffer a highly customizable payload delivery system that may be able to combine radiotherapy with immunotherapy for boosting therapeutic outcome while minimizing toxicity. The incorporation of anti-CD40 in the LIFE biomaterial is expected to enhance therapy outcomes due to the additional therapeutic action of anti-CD40 (23). Among the different drug delivery systems designed for controlled delivery of payload (1,24), the LIFE biomaterial presents a system that can serve as a fiducial and also include radio-sensitizing nanoparticles. \n\nIn Figures 4A, B, it can be observed that there is a modest difference when using the LIFE biomaterial with and without radiotherapy. Our analysis with two-tailed test shows no statistically significant difference (p-value = 0.183) between these two arms at 6-weeks post treatment. Altogether, this suggest that the effect of the LIFE biomaterial alone loaded with the anti-CD40 immunotherapy also has a therapeutic benefit as would be expected with anti-CD40. The advantage of using RT is that it can generate more neoantigens, broadening the repertoire of responding T cells, and enhancing efficacy as",

            "text": "CP-based OECT configurations are gaining popularity as sensitive electrochemical biosensors. OECT biosensors commonly utilize water-processable poly (ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) (Liao et al., 2019), for example in conjunction with lipid bilayers to detect the ion pore \u03b1-hemolysin (Zhang et al., 2016). Recent OECT biosensors have explored alternative CPs with tailored structures. Giovannitti et al. (2018) synthesized a naphthalene-bithiophene-based donor-acceptor copolymer (10) and introduced glycol side chains via amine-anhydride coupling to improve ion transport in OECTs. The CP was coated with GOx or lactate oxidase without enzyme immobilization and used for glucose (Savva et al., 2019), or lactate (Pappa et al., 2018) detection, respectively, with good LODs (both 10 \u00b5M). Wustoni et al. (2019) synthesized thiophene derivatives functionalized with 15-crown-5 and 18-crown-6 ethers to selectively trap sodium and potassium ions, respectively, two important ions in cell signaling. Each monomer was copolymerized with ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) onto OECTs using various electropolymerization methods. Under an optimized OECT gate potential, the copolymers (11a/11b) performed selective, real-time detection of sodium and potassium ions with good LODs (20/100 \u00b5M), broad linear detection ranges (10-10 6 /100-10 6 \u00b5M), and comparable sensitivities to the \"gold-standard\" PEDOT:PSS. \n\nAlternatively to CPs, semiconducting dyes are commercially available and readily undergo electropolymerization forming redox-active polymers. The earlier use of organic dye-based polymers in electrochemical biosensors has been reviewed (Barsan et al., 2015).",

The abundance of silicon means that the cost of using this material as a matrix is slight, which is an essential design consideration for population-based screening applications. \n\nThe enthusiasm for this molecular diagnostic platform is growing but this new family of molecular diagnostics must be carefully validated. First, the specificity and reproducibility of this approach must be established in model systems. Next, the level of sensitivity must be optimized to ensure signal detection in clinically relevant specimens. The current generation of biosensor assays may not include polymerase chain reaction amplification steps. Whether informative markers can be monitored within the existing range of detection with direct hybridization remains to be estab- lished. The necessity of a signal amplification step would significantly increase the complexity and the cost of these proce- dures. Therefore, all the specimen-han- dling procedures must be optimized to prevent clinical specimen loss. At least ini- tially in assay development, the focus must be on abundantly expressed target mole- cules. Innovative strategies to recover epi- thelial cells from clinical specimens are being considered to increase the information obtained by these techniques. \n\nUltimately, the information provided by these automated, robotically driven assays will include many molecular probes ana- lyzed on serial clinical specimens obtained during large clinical trials. Because this tech- nology evaluates multiple genetic markers at once, systematic clinical investigation will be required to discern the most informative markers for inclusion in a detection panel. The potential information load generated with this type of technology will soon be overwhelming. Developing rigorous epidemiological and biometric approaches for optimal management and retrieval of infor- mation contained in such data sets will be instrumental in revealing directions for continuing improvement in this technology.",

When a molecule binds to the metal surface the dielectric properties of the interface change and detected by the photodetector [18]. Various studies have shown the detection of cancer cells by this system such as VEGF breast cancer (100 pg/ml), AFP liver cancer (500 pg/ml), f-PSA prostate cancer (100 fg/ml) [26,27,28]. This method is improved by installing a CCD camera for image capturing [29]. Also, the system is combined with the classical sandwich enzyme assay. In this, the system antigen is a sandwich between a primary antibody and a labeled antibody [30]. This is system is also coated with nanoparticles (Au and silver) which amplify the signal and are rapidly detected by the detector [31].",

Various biorecognition element immobilization techniques are also compatible with polymer electrodes [102,103]. Implantable and wearable biosensors require electrode-tissue mechanical matching, which is made possible by polymers' mechanical properties. An (organic) con-jugated polymer (CP) electrode or a polymer composite can be categorized as a type of polymer electrode, and they have long been used for pathogen detection [104][105][106]. \n\nRemarkable transparency, biocompatibility, low oxidation potential, outstanding conductivity, ease of fabrication, low cost, and a small band gap (e.g., 1.6 eV) are some of the special qualities of organic CPs [107][108][109]. Poly (acetylene), poly (pyrrole), poly(thiophene), poly(terthiophene), poly(aniline), poly(fluorine), poly (3-alkylthiophene), poly tetrathiafulvalene, poly naphthalene, and poly (p-phenylene sulfide), poly(para-phenylene vinylene) are examples of common types of organic CPs [107,109]. \n\nE. coli and human influenza A virus were detected using spin-coated films coated with poly (3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene) [76]. Organic CPs' semiconducting nature gives them unique optical and optoelectronic capabilities. Thus, synthetic chemists' capacity to modify the chemical structures of polymerized monomers allows for the design and tweaking of CPs for particular purposes [109]. \n\nPolymer composite electrodes, which comprise a nonconductive polymer combined with a conductive one, frequently conduct or convey scattered words.",

The study included the results of genotyping biomaterial samples on high-density DNA chips (venous blood of 1,277 Kazakh patients (in the third generation) with a verified diagnosis of breast cancer with locally advanced and disseminated breast cancer who received anticancer therapy), clinical data of patients, data on the clinical efficacy and toxicity of drug therapy.

The family history study showed 16.52 % of women in the questionnaires had a family history of various types of ESR, and 86.25 % of them had a burden of breast cancer in women of the first degree of kinship. The average age of patients with breast cancer was 48.79 \u00b1 11.44 years.

In this study, we constructed 4T1 cell membrane-coated m-PBTQ4F Pdots (CPdots) with enhanced NIR-II photoacoustic (PA) and fluorescence (FL) imaging capability for NIR-II photothermal therapy (PTT) of breast tumors. Our findings demonstrated that CPdots could specifically target breast tumors, leading to enhanced tumor accumulation after systemic administration in living mice. In addition, CPdots can not only serve as contrast agents for NIR-II PA and FL imaging for improved breast tumor detection but also generate more cytotoxic heat to improve PTT efficacy.

We demonstrate that EM 12+, with a strong absorption (500-850 nm), efficiently quenches the fluorescence (580, 700, or 830 nm) of different fluorophores within 12+-SNPs, while the selective conversion into colorless diene 2 via H2S-mediated two-electron reduction significantly recovers fluorescence, allowing for non-invasive imaging of hepatic and tumor H2S in mice in real time. Strikingly, EM 12+ is further applied to design a near-infrared photosensitizer with tumor-targeting and H2S-activatable ability for effective photodynamic therapy (PDT) of H2S-related tumors in mice. This study demonstrates promise for applying EMs to build activatable probes for molecular imaging of H2S and selective PDT of tumors, which may lead to the development of new EMs capable of detecting and regulating essential biological processes in vivo.",

A material to be used to fabricate any of these devices should possess an array of properties, which include biocompatibility, no toxicity, bioactivity, low wear rate, low to moderate incidence of artifacts during imaging, tensile strength and modulus that are comparable to those of cortical bone, high fatigue strength/long fatigue life, minimal or no negative impact on radiotherapy (RT) planning and delivery, and high capability for fusion to the contiguous bone. The shortcomings of Ti6Al4V alloy for these applications with respect to these desirable properties are well recognized, opening the field for an investigation about novel biomaterials that could replace the current gold standard. Previously published reviews on this topic have exhibited significant shortcomings in the studies they included, such as a small, heterogenous sample size and the lack of a cost-benefit analysis, extremely useful to understand the practical possibility of applying a novel material on a large scale. Therefore, this review aims to collect information about the clinical performance of these biomaterials from the most recent literature, with the objective of deliberating which could potentially be better than titanium in the future, with particular attention to safety, artifact production and radiotherapy planning interference. The significant promise showed by analyzing the clinical performance of these devices warrants further research through prospective studies with a larger sample size also taking into account each aspect of the production and use of such materials. Methods The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used to improve the reporting of the review. The search was performed from March 2022 to September 2023. Results At the end of the screening process, 20 articles were considered eligible for this study. Polyetheretherketone (PEEK), Carbon-fibre reinforced polyetheretherketone (CFR-PEEK), long carbon fiber reinforced polymer (LCFRP), Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), and carbon screw and rods were used in the included studies. Conclusion CFR-PEEK displays a noninferior safety and efficacy profile to titanium implanted devices. However, it also has other advantages. By decreasing artifact production, it is able to increase detection of local tumor recurrence and decrease radiotherapy dose perturbation, ultimately bettering prognosis for patients necessitating adjuvant treatment. Nonetheless, its drawbacks have not been explored fully and still require further investigation in future studies. This does not exclude the fact that CFR-PEEK could be a valid alternative to titanium in the near future.",

Depending on the polymer structures, SPNs can be developed into optical agents for fluorescence and chemiluminescence imaging, photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy, and heat converters for photothermal therapy. In this feature article, recent work is summarized on the development of SPNs for in vivo photoacoustic (PA) imaging, a state-of-the-art imaging modality that converts light energy into mechanical acoustic waves to provide deep tissue penetration. The structure-property relationship and doping approaches are discussed to reveal the importance of promoting nonradiative decay in amplifying the PA brightness of SPNs. Moreover, their imaging applications, including lymph node mapping, tumor imaging, and monitoring of pathological indexes, are highlighted. These studies demonstrate that SPNs can serve as versatile PA agents for advanced molecular imaging applications.",
                    "[4107691 | Pu et al. | 2014 | Citations: 994]": "Photoacoustic (PA) imaging holds great promise for the visualization of physiology and pathology at the molecular level with deep tissue penetration and fine spatial resolution. To fully utilize this potential, PA molecular imaging probes have to be developed. Herein we introduce near infrared (NIR) light absorbing semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) as a new class of contrast agents for PA molecular imaging. SPNs can produce stronger signal than commonly used single-wall carbon nanotubes and gold nanorods on a per mass basis, permitting whole-body lymph node PA mapping in living mice at a low systematic injection mass. Furthermore, SPNs possess high structural flexibility, narrow PA spectral profiles, and strong resistance to photodegradation and oxidation, which enables development of the first NIR ratiometric PA probe for in vivo real-time imaging of reactive oxygen species\u2014vital chemical mediators of many diseases. These results demonstrate SPNs an ideal nanoplatform for developing PA molecular probes."

Here, the quinoid polymers have been developed to effectively regulate the ICT for brighter NIR-II fluorescence signals. Thiophene repeat chain units of different lengths (T, 2T, and 3T) were utilized to link with electron-withdrawing ester-substituted thieno[3,4- b]thiophene (TT) to alter the density of the electron-withdrawing side groups for controlling the ICT. By increasing the thiophene chain length from TT-T to TT-3T, the density of the electron-withdrawing groups decreased and the ICT was weakened. In the case of NIR absorption and NIR-II emission, weakened ICT leads to brighter NIR-II fluorescence.

Here we introduce an NAD(P)H-sensitive polymer dot (Pdot) biosensor for point-of-care monitoring of metabolites. The Pdot is combined with a metabolite-specific NAD(P)H-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of the metabolite, generating NAD(P)H.

Metabolite concentration is quantified ratiometrically-based on the ratio of blue-to-red channel emission intensities, with a digital camera-with high sensitivity and specificity. We demonstrate phenylalanine biosensing in human plasma for a phenylketonuria screening test, quantifying several other disease-related metabolites (lactate, glucose, glutamate, and \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate), and a paper-based assay with smartphore imaging for point-of-care use.

A photocrosslinkable semiconducting polymer is blended with a porogen such as degradable macromolecule to form compact polymer dots (Pdots). After crosslinking the polymer and removing the porogen, this approach yields semiconducting polymer nanospheres with open cavities that are tunable in diameter. Both small molecules and macromolecules can be loaded in the nanocavities, where molecular size can be differentiated by the efficiency of the energy transfer from host polymer to guest molecules. An anticancer drug doxorubicin (Dox) is loaded into the nanocavities and the intracellular release is monitored in real time by the fluorescence signal. Finally, the efficient delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) to silence gene expression without affecting cell viability is demonstrated. The combined features of bright fluorescence, tunable cavity, and efficient drug/siRNA delivery makes these nanostructures promising for biomedical imaging and drug delivery."

Advances in the design of various diagnostic and therapeutic agents, and the recent trend of utilizing molecules for both therapeutic and diagnostic applications (i.e. theranostics), still have not achieved the maximum benefits of controlling the navigation and biodistribution of these molecules within the biological system. The key challenges towards the use of these agents, from small molecules to macromolecular drugs (e.g. natural, proteins and nucleic acids-based drugs, or synthetic, polymer-based conjugates, carriers or other systems), are, for example, the loss of activity via rapid clearance or degradation, inefficient delivery to the target sites, and inappropriate probing of the disease states, dependent on the particular disease and its location in the body. The concept of nanotechnology has been initiated early in 1959 by Richard Feynman in his famous historical talk at Caltech \u201cThere\u2019s Plenty of Room at the Bottom\u201d, with introduction of the possibility of manipulating materials at the atomic and molecular levels.1 In 1974, Norio Taniguchi, at Tokyo University, first utilized the term \u201cnanotechnology\u201d referring to the design of materials on the nanoscale.2 In the early 1990\u2019s and until now, the use of nanomaterials of different nature (organic and inorganic), and for various applications (multiple disciplines) has been greatly expanded, in particular, over the last couple of decades.3-4 In the medical field, nanotechnology has emerged to include non-invasive systems for probing of disease and also capable of carrying cargo for localized high concentration delivery, known as \u201cnanomedicine\u201d, with reduction of off-target effects. The use of nanomaterials, in particular polymeric nanostructures, has demonstrated efficiency in improving delivery of diagnostic and therapeutic agents to the target sites, and the feasibility of incorporating several therapeutic/diagnostic/targeting moieties within specific compartments of the nanoparticles, with control of their navigation in the body and to the target sites. Further understanding of the nature and microenvironments of biological systems (e.g. different pH, temperature, permeability, drainage, or overexpressing proteins, enzymes or receptors), and the barriers towards the delivery of various moieties to their destinations, which could be either intra- or extracellular, has aided the design of nanomaterials that could evade the various physiological barriers. Selective delivery to the site of the disease can increase the therapeutic efficacy, imaging contrast and accuracy, reduce adverse reactions, and reduce the dose and cost of medications. \n \nInitially, platform technologies were the target for nanostructure designs, but with the complications of biological systems, it has been recognized over the past decade that disease- and patient-specific medical treatment is needed for efficacy\u2014this review highlights a few examples developed within the past couple of years, with a focus on in vivo studies together with novel designs and significant advances in syntheses. The advantages of polymeric nanostructures over other types of nanomaterials are based upon the flexibility over which their structures can be modified to yield materials of various compositions, morphologies, sizes, surface properties, with possibility of hierarchical assembly of several nanomaterials of various components into one construct that can be accommodated with a variety of therapeutic, diagnostic and/or targeting moieties, within selective compartments of the nanodevices. High efficiency in diagnosis and treatment of diseases and improving patient quality of life and compliance can be achieved through understanding the molecular events associated with various diseases, and combining the advances in the design of therapeutic and diagnostic agents and nanomaterials, together with the innovative instruments utilized for monitoring these agents. This review will focus on several recent advances in the design of polymeric nanoparticles that have been utilized for delivery of diagnostic and/or therapeutic agents, and the various barriers towards the clinical development of these materials. After a brief overview of the capabilities and challenges with medical imaging and therapy, in general, disease-specific examples of polymer nanoparticles designed specifically to overcome the challenges and address unmet medical needs will be discussed in detail.",

Semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) composed of polymers with \u03c0-electron delocalized backbones can be designed to amplify their PA imaging and PTT performance, because of their clear structure-property relation and versatility in modifying their molecular structures to tune their photophysical properties. This review summarizes the recent advances in the photoacoustic imaging and photothermal therapy applications of semiconducting polymer nanoparticles with a focus on signal amplification and second near-infrared (NIR-II, 1000-1700\u00a0nm) construction. The strategies such as structure-property screening, fluorescence quenching, accelerated heat dissipation, and size-dependent heat dissipation are first discussed to amplify the PA brightness of SPNs for in vivo PA. The molecular approaches to shifting the absorption of SPNs for NIR-II PA imaging and PTT are then introduced so as to improve the tissue penetration depth for diagnosis and therapy.

However, some types of cancer exhibited a low response rate to immunotherapy, and the high risk of immune-related side effects has been aroused during immunotherapy, which greatly restrict its broad applications in cancer therapy. Phototherapy that uses external light to trigger the therapeutic process holds advantages including high selectivity and efficiency, and low side effects. Recently, it has been proven to be able to stimulate immune response in the tumor region by inducing immunogenic cell death (ICD), the process of which was termed photo-immunotherapy, dramatically improving therapeutic specificity over conventional immunotherapy in several aspects. Among numerous optical materials for photo-immunotherapy, semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) have gained more and more attention owing to their excellent optical properties and good biocompatibility. In this review, we summarize recent developments of SPNs for immunotherapy and imaging of immunoactivation. Different therapeutic modalities triggered by SPNs including photo-immunotherapy and photo-immunometabolic therapy are first introduced. Then, applications of SPNs for real-time monitoring immunoactivation are discussed. Finally, the conclusion and future perspectives of this research field are given."

Moreover, the intrinsic oxygen\u2010sensitive nature of afterglow makes those nanoagents potentially useful for in vivo imaging of oxygen levels. Thus, this study introduces a generation of light\u2010excitation\u2010free background\u2010minimized optical imaging agents for the sensitive detection of diseased tissues in vivo."

The theranostic SPNs have a binary optical component nanostructure, wherein a near-infrared absorbing semiconducting polymer and an ultrasmall carbon dot (fullerene) interact with each other to induce photoinduced electron transfer upon light irradiation. Such an intraparticle optoelectronic interaction augments heat generation and consequently enhances the photoacoustic signal and maximum photothermal temperature of SPNs by 2.6- and 1.3-fold, respectively. With the use of the amplified SPN as the theranostic nanoagent, it permits enhanced photoacoustic imaging and photothermal ablation of tumor in living mice.

As compared with nondoped SPNs, the NIR fluorescence imaging ability of nanoceria-doped SPNs is similar due to the optically inactive nature of nanoceria; however, the self-regulated photodynamic properties of nanoceria-doped SPN not only result in dramatically reduced nonspecific damage to normal tissue under NIR laser irradiation but also lead to significantly enhanced photodynamic efficacy for cancer therapy in a murine mouse model.

To reduce side effects, protherapeutic agents that can be activated by overexpressed cancer biomarkers are under development. However, these agents still face certain extent of off-target activation in normal tissues, stimulating the interest to design external-stimuli activatable protherapeutics. In this regard, photoactivatable protherapeutic agents have been utilized for cancer treatments. However, because of the intrinsic features of photolabile moieties, most photoactivatable protherapeutic agents only respond to ultraviolet-visible light, limiting their in vivo applications. Thus, protherapeutic agents that can be activated by near-infrared (NIR) light with minimal phototoxicity and increased tissue penetration are highly desired. In this Account, we summarize our semiconducting polymer nanomaterials (SPNs) as NIR photoactivatable protherapeutic agents for cancer treatment. SPNs are transformed from \u03c0-conjugated polymers that efficiently convert NIR light into heat or singlet oxygen (1O2). With photothermal and photodynamic properties, SPNs can be directly used as photomedicine or serve as light transducers to activate heat or 1O2-responsive protherapeutic agents. The heat-activatable SPN-based protherapeutic agents are developed by loading or conjugating of SPNs with therapeutic agents (e.g., agonist, gene, and enzyme). For instance, photothermally triggered release of agonists specifically activates certain protein ion channels on the cellular membrane, leading to ion overinflux induced mitochondria dysfunction and consequently apoptosis of cancer cells. Moreover, photothermal activation of temperature-sensitive bromelain can promote the in situ degradation of collagens (the major components of extracellular matrix), resulting in an improved accumulation of agents in tumor tissues and thus amplified therapeutic outcome. The 1O2-activatable SPN-based protherapeutic agents are constructed through covalent conjugation of SPNs with caged therapeutic agents via hypoxia- or 1O2-cleavable linkers. Upon NIR photoirradiation, SPNs consume oxygen to generate 1O2, which leads to photodynamic therapy (PDT), and meanwhile breaks hypoxia- or 1O2-cleavable linkers for on-demand release and in situ activation of caged protherapeutic molecules (e.g., chemodrug, enzyme, and inhibitor). Such remote activation of SPN-based protherapeutic agents can be applied to induce DNA damage, ribonucleic acid degradation, inhibition of protein biosynthesis, or immune system activation in tumors of living animals. By synergizing PDT with NIR photoactivation of those biological actions, these protherapeutic agents effectively eliminate tumors and even fully inhibit tumor metastasis. This Account highlights the potential of SPNs for construction of versatile NIR photoactivatable protherapeutics to treat cancer at designated times and locations with high therapeutic outcome and precision."

To enhance the performance of PAI further, researchers have developed several exogenous contrast agents such as metallic nanoparticles, carbon-based nanomaterials, quantum dots, organic small molecules, semiconducting polymer nanoparticles, and so on. These exogenous contrast agents not only help improving the imaging contrast, but also make targeted molecular imaging possible.

Such completely organic nanoagents consist of \u03c0\u2010conjugated yet oxidizable optical polymer as PA generator and hydrolyzable amphiphilic polymer as particle matrix to provide water solubility. The obtained SPNs are readily degraded by myeloperoxidase and lipase abundant in phagocytes, transforming from nonfluorescent nanoparticles (30 nm) into NIR fluorescent ultrasmall metabolites (\u22481 nm). As such, these nanoagents can be effectively cleared out via both hepatobiliary and renal excretions after systematic administration, leaving no toxicity to living mice. Particularly these nanoagents possess high photothermal conversion efficiencies and emit bright PA signals at 1064 nm, enabling sensitive NIR\u2010II PA imaging of both subcutaneous tumor and deep brain vasculature through intact skull in living animals at a low systematic dosage.

With the merits of excellent photoacoustic and photothermal performance, high photostability, proper size, and low toxicity, SPNs not only show efficient cellular uptake for PAI and PTT toward U87 glioma cells but also demonstrate effective accumulation in both subcutaneous tumor and brain tumor upon intravenous injection, thereby realizing efficient PAI-guided PTT toward gliomas under NIR-II light irradiation."

                "text": "\nSemiconducting polymers (SPs) represent a class of organic materials that combine the electrical conductivity properties of semiconductors with the mechanical flexibility and processing advantages of polymers. Unlike traditional inorganic semiconductors, these conjugated polymers feature alternating single and double bonds along their backbone, creating a delocalized \u03c0-electron system that enables charge transport and unique optoelectronic properties. This conjugation allows them to absorb and emit light in the visible to near-infrared (NIR) spectrum, making them particularly valuable for biological imaging applications including tumor detection. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">\n\nSPs offer distinct advantages over conventional biomaterials for tumor detection due to their tunable bandgap, which allows precise control over their absorption and emission wavelengths. This tunability is achieved through molecular design and chemical modifications of the polymer structure, enabling optimization for specific biological applications. Additionally, semiconducting polymers can be processed into various nanoformulations such as nanoparticles, nanodots, and nanofibers, which further enhances their utility for in vivo imaging and tumor detection. Their large absorption coefficients, high quantum yields, and ability to function in the NIR window (where biological tissues have minimal light absorption) give them superior performance characteristics compared to many traditional fluorescent probes and biomaterials. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">",

                "text": "\nSemiconducting polymers (SPs) possess exceptional optical properties that make them particularly advantageous for tumor detection compared to traditional biomaterials. Their unique \u03c0-conjugated backbones create delocalized electrons that enable remarkable optical features, including large absorption coefficients, high quantum yields, and tunable absorption spectra ranging from visible to near-infrared (NIR) regions <Paper corpusId=\"155642523\" paperTitle=\"(Gargiulo et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. These properties can be precisely controlled through molecular engineering, allowing researchers to optimize their optical performance for specific biomedical applications <Paper corpusId=\"221660902\" paperTitle=\"(Xie et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nWhen formulated into nanoparticles (SPNs), these materials demonstrate superior brightness compared to conventional fluorescent agents. Studies have shown that polymer dot-labeled cancer cells exhibit fluorescence intensity 25 times higher than quantum dot-labeled cells and 18 times higher than Alexa Fluor-labeled cells, demonstrating their exceptional signal strength for cellular detection <Paper corpusId=\"209392700\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. This heightened sensitivity is crucial for early tumor detection when malignant cell populations are small and difficult to visualize with conventional imaging techniques.\n\nA significant advantage of SPs for tumor detection is their excellent performance in the near-infrared (NIR) windows, particularly NIR-I (700-900 nm) and NIR-II (1000-1700 nm), where biological tissues exhibit minimal light absorption and autofluorescence <Paper corpusId=\"251433792\" paperTitle=\"(Men et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. This characteristic enables deep-tissue imaging with enhanced signal-to-background ratios, allowing for more accurate tumor visualization <Paper corpusId=\"199056735\" paperTitle=\"(He et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. For instance, multilayered SPN structures have been designed that permit not only lymph node tracking but also sensitive tumor imaging through their enhanced NIR fluorescence properties <Paper corpusId=\"199056735\" paperTitle=\"(He et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nFurthermore, SPs demonstrate exceptional versatility across multiple imaging modalities. They have been successfully employed in fluorescence imaging for tumor visualization and cell tracking, photoacoustic imaging of vasculature and tumors, and even as contrast agents for multimodal imaging approaches <Paper corpusId=\"221660902\" paperTitle=\"(Xie et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"246066001\" paperTitle=\"(Yuan et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. Notably, studies have demonstrated that SPNs produce stronger photoacoustic signals than commonly used single-wall carbon nanotubes and gold nanorods on a per mass basis, allowing for whole-body lymph node mapping in living mice at remarkably low doses <Paper corpusId=\"250996126\" paperTitle=\"(Hui et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"4107691\" paperTitle=\"(Pu et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe photostability of SPs represents another critical advantage for tumor detection applications. Unlike many organic dyes that rapidly photobleach, SPs maintain their optical properties during extended imaging sessions, enabling longitudinal tumor monitoring and providing reliable signals for image-guided procedures <Paper corpusId=\"253274990\" paperTitle=\"(He et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"31038259\" paperTitle=\"(Zhou et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>. Their resistance to photodegradation and oxidation has allowed for the development of ratiometric probes that can track reactive oxygen species in real-time, providing valuable information about the tumor microenvironment <Paper corpusId=\"155642523\" paperTitle=\"(Gargiulo et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"4107691\" paperTitle=\"(Pu et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nBeyond passive imaging, SPs can function as activatable probes with biomarker-triggered signals, offering quantifiable real-time information on pathological status at the molecular level <Paper corpusId=\"250996126\" paperTitle=\"(Hui et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. For example, SPNs have been designed to detect oxygen levels in the tumor microenvironment through oxygen-sensitive afterglow imaging, allowing visualization of tiny peritoneal metastatic tumors almost invisible to the naked eye <Paper corpusId=\"254688030\" paperTitle=\"(Huang et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"51922576\" paperTitle=\"(Cui et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nAdditionally, SPs can be designed with large absorption cross-sections and broad absorbance spectra that effectively harvest light energy, making them excellent for applications such as chemiluminescence imaging where signal amplification is critical <Paper corpusId=\"258470288\" paperTitle=\"(Rosenkrans et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This property, combined with their ability to generate reactive oxygen species upon photoactivation, enables them to serve not only as imaging agents but also as therapeutic platforms for photodynamic and photothermal tumor treatments <Paper corpusId=\"254688030\" paperTitle=\"(Huang et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"51909178\" paperTitle=\"(Li et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>.",

                            "The PDs bioconjugates were able to label cellular targets in an effective and specific manner, including a cell surface marker on human breast cancer cells, with no need to detect nonspecific binding. The authors demonstrated that the fluorescence exhibited by PDlabeled MCF-7 cells was 25 times higher than that of QDlabeled cells and 18 times higher than that of Alexa Fluor-labeled cells, according to flow cytometry analysis [67]. Based on the results, the authors believe that these ultrabright nanoparticles were successfully bioconjugated. Thus, this strategy provides a new opportunity for applying versatile semiconducting polymers to different fluorescence measurement methods in biomedicine and modern biology."

To fully utilize this potential, PA molecular imaging probes have to be developed. Herein we introduce near infrared (NIR) light absorbing semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) as a new class of contrast agents for PA molecular imaging. SPNs can produce stronger signal than commonly used single-wall carbon nanotubes and gold nanorods on a per mass basis, permitting whole-body lymph node PA mapping in living mice at a low systematic injection mass. Furthermore, SPNs possess high structural flexibility, narrow PA spectral profiles, and strong resistance to photodegradation and oxidation, which enables development of the first NIR ratiometric PA probe for in vivo real-time imaging of reactive oxygen species\u2014vital chemical mediators of many diseases. These results demonstrate SPNs an ideal nanoplatform for developing PA molecular probes."

                            "The fact that cancer metastasis is the main cause of death for most cancer patients necessitates the development of imaging tools for sensitive detection of metastases. Although optical imaging has high temporospatial resolution, tissue autofluorescence compromises the sensitivity for in vivo imaging of cancer metastasis. Herein, the synthesis of a series of photosensitizer\u2010incorporated poly(p\u2010phenylenevinylene)\u2010based semiconducting copolymers and their utility as near\u2010infrared (NIR) afterglow imaging nanoagents that emit light after cessation of light irradiation are reported. As compared with nondoped nanoparticles, the nanoparticles derived from the photosensitizer\u2010incorporated copolymers have red\u2010shifted NIR luminescence and amplified afterglow signals, allowing the detection of tiny peritoneal metastatic tumors almost invisible to naked eye. Moreover, the intrinsic oxygen\u2010sensitive nature of afterglow makes those nanoagents potentially useful for in vivo imaging of oxygen levels. Thus, this study introduces a generation of light\u2010excitation\u2010free background\u2010minimized optical imaging agents for the sensitive detection of diseased tissues in vivo."

However, their imaging ability and therapeutic efficacy are often limited due to the presence of delivery barriers in the tumor microenvironment. Herein, we report the development of organic multimodal phototheranostic nanoagents that can biomimetically target cancer-associated fibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment for enhanced multimodal imaging-guided cancer therapy. Such biomimetic nanocamouflages comprise a near-infrared (NIR) absorbing semiconducting polymer nanoparticle (SPN) coated with the cell membranes of activated fibroblasts. The homologous targeting mechanism allows the activated fibroblast cell membrane coated SPN (AF-SPN) to specifically target cancer-associated fibroblasts, leading to enhanced tumor accumulation relative to the uncoated and cancer cell membrane coated counterparts after systemic administration in living mice. As such, AF-SPN not only provides stronger NIR fluorescence and photoacoustic signals to detect tumors but also generates enhanced cytotoxic heat and singlet oxygen to exert combinational photothermal and photodynamic therapy, ultimately leading to an antitumor efficacy higher than that of the counterparts. This study introduces an organic phototheranostic system that biomimetically targets the component in the tumor microenvironment for enhanced multimodal cancer theranostics."

                "text": "\nSemiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) demonstrate exceptional tumor detection capabilities that surpass traditional biomaterials through multiple mechanisms. One key advantage is their significantly enhanced photoacoustic (PA) signal generation\u2014SPNs produce stronger PA signals than commonly used imaging agents such as single-wall carbon nanotubes and gold nanorods on a per mass basis, enabling whole-body lymph node mapping in living mice at remarkably low injection doses <Paper corpusId=\"4107691\" paperTitle=\"(Pu et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"265229155\" paperTitle=\"(Kumar et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. This superior signal strength translates directly to improved tumor visualization sensitivity, critical for early cancer detection when malignant cell populations are small.\n\nThe effectiveness of SPNs for tumor detection is further enhanced by their absorption properties in the near-infrared II (NIR-II) window (1000-1700 nm), where biological tissues exhibit minimal light absorption and reduced scattering. This characteristic enables deep-tissue imaging with unprecedented penetration depths\u2014some SPN formulations have demonstrated PA signal detection through 6.5 cm of chicken breast tissue in vitro, and visualization of structures beneath 5-5.8 cm of tissue in animal models with acceptable signal-to-noise ratios <Paper corpusId=\"244774866\" paperTitle=\"(Ding et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. This deep-tissue imaging capability is particularly valuable for detecting tumors in challenging anatomical locations, such as brain tumors, where SPNs have shown effective accumulation and imaging potential upon intravenous injection <Paper corpusId=\"220371348\" paperTitle=\"(Wen et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"276809915\" paperTitle=\"(Rizwan et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nA notable advantage of SPNs is their ability to function as activatable probes that respond to specific tumor microenvironment characteristics. For example, some SPNs have been designed to detect oxygen levels through oxygen-sensitive afterglow imaging, allowing visualization of tiny peritoneal metastatic tumors that are almost invisible to the naked eye <Paper corpusId=\"51922576\" paperTitle=\"(Cui et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"254688030\" paperTitle=\"(Huang et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. This capability enables real-time monitoring of pathological status at the molecular level, providing quantifiable information on tumor biology beyond simple anatomical imaging <Paper corpusId=\"250996126\" paperTitle=\"(Hui et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe design flexibility of semiconducting polymers allows for structural modifications that enhance their tumor detection efficacy. For instance, the incorporation of vinylene bonds into polymer backbones has been shown to significantly increase mass absorption coefficients (by 1.3-fold) and photothermal conversion efficiencies (by 2.4-fold), resulting in stronger PA signals for more sensitive tumor detection <Paper corpusId=\"206718590\" paperTitle=\"(Lyu et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>. Similarly, incorporating electron-deficient units into the backbone of semiconducting polymers has amplified PA imaging signals by 1.7-fold in live mice, enhancing tumor delineation by 4.7-fold after systemic administration <Paper corpusId=\"271282317\" paperTitle=\"(Neelamraju et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nFurthermore, SPNs can be engineered with biomimetic targeting capabilities to overcome delivery barriers in the tumor microenvironment. For example, activated fibroblast cell membrane-coated SPNs (AF-SPNs) specifically target cancer-associated fibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment, leading to enhanced tumor accumulation and stronger NIR fluorescence and PA signals compared to uncoated counterparts <Paper corpusId=\"51909178\" paperTitle=\"(Li et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"254688030\" paperTitle=\"(Huang et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. This biomimetic approach represents a significant advancement in targeting the components of the tumor microenvironment for enhanced detection sensitivity.\n\nThe versatility of SPNs extends to multimodal imaging approaches, including fluorescence, photoacoustic, and chemiluminescence imaging, providing complementary information for comprehensive tumor detection <Paper corpusId=\"221660902\" paperTitle=\"(Xie et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"254688030\" paperTitle=\"(Huang et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. Particularly in the NIR-II window, SPNs offer excellent photostability and biocompatibility while enabling high-resolution imaging of vasculature and tumors, crucial for detecting both primary tumors and metastases <Paper corpusId=\"119104869\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al._1, 2019)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"251433792\" paperTitle=\"(Men et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nAdditionally, SPNs can be designed as metabolizable nanoagents that can be cleared via renal and hepatobiliary pathways after fulfilling their imaging function, minimizing potential toxicity concerns <Paper corpusId=\"58648939\" paperTitle=\"(Jiang et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"271282317\" paperTitle=\"(Neelamraju et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.

                            "Photoacoustic imaging (PA) in the second near infrared (NIR-II) window presents key advantages for deep tissue imaging owing to reduced light scattering and low background signal from biological structures. Here, a thiadiazoloquinoxaline-based semiconducting polymer (SP) with strong absorption in the NIR-II region is reported. After encapsulation of SP in Pluronic F127 (F127) followed by removal of excess surfactant, a dual functional polymer system named surfactant-stripped semiconductor polymeric micelles (SSS-micelles) are generated with water solubility, storage stability, and high photothermal conversion efficiency, permitting tumor theranostics in a mouse model. SSS-micelles have a wideband absorption in the NIR-II window, allowing for the PA imaging at both 1064 and 1300\u00a0nm wavelengths. The PA signal of the SSS-micelles can be detected through 6.5\u00a0cm of chicken breast tissue in vitro. In mice or rats, SSS-micelles can be visualized in bladder and intestine overlaid 5\u00a0cm (signal to noise ratio, SNR \u2248 17 dB)\u00a0and 5.8\u00a0cm (SNR over 10\u00a0dB) chicken breast tissue, respectively. This work demonstrates the SSS-micelles as a nanoplatform for deep tissue theranostics."

                            "Precise diagnosis and effective treatment of gliomas still remain a huge challenge. Photoacoustic-guided photothermal therapy (PTT) has unique advantages over conventional techniques for brain tumor theranostics, but existing nano-agents for PAI-guided PTT are mainly organic small molecules or inorganic nanoparticles, which have the limitations of poor photostability and biocompatibility. Besides, the restricted absorption in the first near-infrared window (NIR-I) of most existing nano-agents compromises their effectiveness for deep tissue PAI and PTT. We herein develop novel semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) that are strongly absorptive in the second near-infrared window (NIR-II) to alleviate these problems. With the merits of excellent photoacoustic and photothermal performance, high photostability, proper size, and low toxicity, SPNs not only show efficient cellular uptake for PAI and PTT toward U87 glioma cells but also demonstrate effective accumulation in both subcutaneous tumor and brain tumor upon intravenous injection, thereby realizing efficient PAI-guided PTT toward gliomas under NIR-II light irradiation."

Fan et al. established perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic diimide (PDI) nanoparticles, featuring a tertiary amine electron donor and a diimide electron acceptor, for deep brain tumor imaging (Fig. 10a) (Fan et al., 2015). Modified with DSPE-mPEG 5000 for water stability, these PDI nanoparticles showed enhanced PA signals in animal models with orthotopic glioblastoma upon continuous 700 nm laser irradiation, highlighting their efficacy through EPR effect and low toxicity (Fig. 10b)."

                            "The fact that cancer metastasis is the main cause of death for most cancer patients necessitates the development of imaging tools for sensitive detection of metastases. Although optical imaging has high temporospatial resolution, tissue autofluorescence compromises the sensitivity for in vivo imaging of cancer metastasis. Herein, the synthesis of a series of photosensitizer\u2010incorporated poly(p\u2010phenylenevinylene)\u2010based semiconducting copolymers and their utility as near\u2010infrared (NIR) afterglow imaging nanoagents that emit light after cessation of light irradiation are reported. As compared with nondoped nanoparticles, the nanoparticles derived from the photosensitizer\u2010incorporated copolymers have red\u2010shifted NIR luminescence and amplified afterglow signals, allowing the detection of tiny peritoneal metastatic tumors almost invisible to naked eye. Moreover, the intrinsic oxygen\u2010sensitive nature of afterglow makes those nanoagents potentially useful for in vivo imaging of oxygen levels. Thus, this study introduces a generation of light\u2010excitation\u2010free background\u2010minimized optical imaging agents for the sensitive detection of diseased tissues in vivo."

As compared with its counterpart SPN (SPNT), the presence of vinylene bonds within the polymer backbone also endows SPNV with a significantly enhanced mass absorption coefficient (1.3-fold) and photothermal conversion efficacy (2.4-fold).

                            "Phototheranostic nanoagents are promising for early diagnosis and precision therapy of cancer. However, their imaging ability and therapeutic efficacy are often limited due to the presence of delivery barriers in the tumor microenvironment. Herein, we report the development of organic multimodal phototheranostic nanoagents that can biomimetically target cancer-associated fibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment for enhanced multimodal imaging-guided cancer therapy. Such biomimetic nanocamouflages comprise a near-infrared (NIR) absorbing semiconducting polymer nanoparticle (SPN) coated with the cell membranes of activated fibroblasts. The homologous targeting mechanism allows the activated fibroblast cell membrane coated SPN (AF-SPN) to specifically target cancer-associated fibroblasts, leading to enhanced tumor accumulation relative to the uncoated and cancer cell membrane coated counterparts after systemic administration in living mice. As such, AF-SPN not only provides stronger NIR fluorescence and photoacoustic signals to detect tumors but also generates enhanced cytotoxic heat and singlet oxygen to exert combinational photothermal and photodynamic therapy, ultimately leading to an antitumor efficacy higher than that of the counterparts. This study introduces an organic phototheranostic system that biomimetically targets the component in the tumor microenvironment for enhanced multimodal cancer theranostics."

However, how to control the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) to maintain the low band gap and improve the NIR-II fluorescence intensity is an urgent issue. Here, the quinoid polymers have been developed to effectively regulate the ICT for brighter NIR-II fluorescence signals. Thiophene repeat chain units of different lengths (T, 2T, and 3T) were utilized to link with electron-withdrawing ester-substituted thieno[3,4- b]thiophene (TT) to alter the density of the electron-withdrawing side groups for controlling the ICT. By increasing the thiophene chain length from TT-T to TT-3T, the density of the electron-withdrawing groups decreased and the ICT was weakened. In the case of NIR absorption and NIR-II emission, weakened ICT leads to brighter NIR-II fluorescence. After the preparation of the water-soluble quinoid polymer probes (CPs), TT-3T CPs with weak ICT exhibited the brightest NIR-II fluorescent signals among the three quinoid polymer probes. Several NIR-II biomedical imaging applications, including in vivo cell tracking, blood vascular system images, and lymphatic drainage mapping, show that the TT-3T CP-based nanoprobe had excellent characteristics of long-term stability and high NIR-II spatial resolutions in vivo."

                            "Photoacoustic (PA) imaging in the second near\u2010infrared (NIR\u2010II) window (1000\u20131700 nm) holds great promise for deep\u2010tissue diagnosis due to the reduced light scattering and minimized tissue absorption; however, exploration of such a noninvasive imaging technique is greatly constrained by the lack of biodegradable NIR\u2010II absorbing agents. Herein, the first series of metabolizable NIR\u2010II PA agents are reported based on semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs). Such completely organic nanoagents consist of \u03c0\u2010conjugated yet oxidizable optical polymer as PA generator and hydrolyzable amphiphilic polymer as particle matrix to provide water solubility. The obtained SPNs are readily degraded by myeloperoxidase and lipase abundant in phagocytes, transforming from nonfluorescent nanoparticles (30 nm) into NIR fluorescent ultrasmall metabolites (\u22481 nm). As such, these nanoagents can be effectively cleared out via both hepatobiliary and renal excretions after systematic administration, leaving no toxicity to living mice. Particularly these nanoagents possess high photothermal conversion efficiencies and emit bright PA signals at 1064 nm, enabling sensitive NIR\u2010II PA imaging of both subcutaneous tumor and deep brain vasculature through intact skull in living animals at a low systematic dosage. This study thus provides a generalized molecular design toward organic metabolizable semiconducting materials for biophotonic applications in NIR\u2010II window."

The development of metabolizable NIR\u2010II nanoagents for imaging\u2010guided therapy are essential for noninvasive disease diagnosis and precise ablation of tumors. Herein, metabolizable highly absorbing NIR\u2010II conjugated polymer dots (Pdots) are reported for the first time for photoacoustic imaging guided photothermal therapy (PTT). The unique design of low\u2010bandgap D\u2010A \u03c0\u2010conjugated polymer (DPP\u2010BTzTD) together with modified nanoreprecipitation conditions allows to fabricate NIR\u2010II absorbing Pdots with ultrasmall (4 nm) particle size. Extensive experimental tests demonstrate that the constructed Pdots exhibit good biocompatibility, excellent photostability, bright photoacoustic signals, and high photothermal conversion efficiency (53%). In addition, upon tail\u2010vein intravenous injection of tumor\u2010bearing mice, Pdots also show high\u2010efficient tumor ablation capability with rapid excretion from the body. In particular, both in vitro and in vivo assays indicate that the Pdots possess remarkable PTT performance under irradiation with a 1064 nm laser with 0.5 W cm\u22122, which is much lower than its maximum permissible exposure limit of 1 W cm\u22122. This pilot study thus paves a novel avenue for the development of organic semiconducting nanoagents for future clinical translation."

                            "Semiconducting polymers (SP) hold great promise for cancer phototherapy due to their excellent optical properties; however, their clinical application is still hampered by their poor biodegradability. Herein, a self\u2010sacrificially biodegradable pseudo\u2010semiconducting polymer (PSP) for NIR\u2010II fluorescence bioimaging, photodynamic immunotherapy, and photoactivated chemotherapy (PACT) is reported. The PSP can further co\u2010assemble with an amphiphilic polyester with pendant doxorubicin (DOX) in its side chains via reactive oxygen species (ROS)\u2010responsive thioketal linkages (PEDOX), which are denoted as NP@PEDOX/PSP. The NP@PEDOX/PSP can accumulate at tumor sites and generate ROS for photodynamic immunotherapy as well as near\u2010infrared\u2010II fluorescence (NIR\u2010II) for bioimaging upon irradition at 808 nm. The ROS could break up thioketal linkages in PEDOX, resulting in rapid doxorubicin (DOX) release for PACT. Finally, both PEDOX and PSP are degraded sacrificially by intracellular glutathione (GSH), resulting in the dissociation of NP@PEDOX/PSP. This work highlights the application of self\u2010sacrificially degradable PSP for NIR\u2010II fluorescence bioimaging, photodynamic immunotherapy, and PACT in cancer therapy."

                            "Development of optical nanotheranostics for the capability of photodynamic therapy (PDT) provides opportunities for advanced cancer therapy. However, most nanotheranostic systems fail to regulate their generation levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) according to the disease microenvironment, which can potentially limit their therapeutic selectivity and increase the risk of damage to normal tissues. We herein report the development of hybrid semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) with self-regulated near-infrared (NIR) photodynamic properties for optimized cancer therapy. The SPNs comprise a binary component nanostructure: a NIR-absorbing semiconducting polymer acts as the NIR fluorescent PDT agent, while nanoceria serves as the smart intraparticle regular to decrease and increase ROS generation at physiologically neutral and pathologically acidic environments, respectively. As compared with nondoped SPNs, the NIR fluorescence imaging ability of nanoceria-doped SPNs is similar due to the optically inactive nature of nanoceria; however, the self-regulated photodynamic properties of nanoceria-doped SPN not only result in dramatically reduced nonspecific damage to normal tissue under NIR laser irradiation but also lead to significantly enhanced photodynamic efficacy for cancer therapy in a murine mouse model. This study thus provides a simple yet effective hybrid approach to modulate the phototherapeutic performance of organic photosensitizers."

                            "In recent years, semiconducting polymer nanoparticles have attracted considerable attention because of their outstanding characteristics as fluorescent probes. These nanoparticles, which primarily consist of \u03c0-conjugated polymers and are called polymer dots (Pdots) when they exhibit small particle size and high brightness, have demonstrated utility in a wide range of applications such as fluorescence imaging and biosensing. In this review, we summarize recent findings of the photophysical properties of Pdots which speak to the merits of these entities as fluorescent labels. This review also highlights the surface functionalization and biomolecular conjugation of Pdots, and their applications in cellular labeling, in vivo imaging, single-particle tracking, biosensing, and drug delivery. We discuss the relationship between the physical properties and performance, and evaluate the merits and limitations of the Pdot probes for certain imaging tasks and fluorescence assays. We also tackle the current challenges of Pdots and share our perspective on the future directions of the field."

To fully utilize this potential, PA molecular imaging probes have to be developed. Herein we introduce near infrared (NIR) light absorbing semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) as a new class of contrast agents for PA molecular imaging. SPNs can produce stronger signal than commonly used single-wall carbon nanotubes and gold nanorods on a per mass basis, permitting whole-body lymph node PA mapping in living mice at a low systematic injection mass. Furthermore, SPNs possess high structural flexibility, narrow PA spectral profiles, and strong resistance to photodegradation and oxidation, which enables development of the first NIR ratiometric PA probe for in vivo real-time imaging of reactive oxygen species\u2014vital chemical mediators of many diseases. These results demonstrate SPNs an ideal nanoplatform for developing PA molecular probes."

                            "Medical diagnosis and therapy are essential for providing patients with proper care, although inefficient diagnosis and therapy are usually associated with either improper detection of the diseases, unsatisfactory therapeutic outcomes and/or serious adverse reactions. Advances in the design of various diagnostic and therapeutic agents, and the recent trend of utilizing molecules for both therapeutic and diagnostic applications (i.e. theranostics), still have not achieved the maximum benefits of controlling the navigation and biodistribution of these molecules within the biological system. The key challenges towards the use of these agents, from small molecules to macromolecular drugs (e.g. natural, proteins and nucleic acids-based drugs, or synthetic, polymer-based conjugates, carriers or other systems), are, for example, the loss of activity via rapid clearance or degradation, inefficient delivery to the target sites, and inappropriate probing of the disease states, dependent on the particular disease and its location in the body. The concept of nanotechnology has been initiated early in 1959 by Richard Feynman in his famous historical talk at Caltech \"There\u2019s Plenty of Room at the Bottom\", with introduction of the possibility of manipulating materials at the atomic and molecular levels.1 In 1974, Norio Taniguchi, at Tokyo University, first utilized the term \"nanotechnology\" referring to the design of materials on the nanoscale.2 In the early 1990\u2019s and until now, the use of nanomaterials of different nature (organic and inorganic), and for various applications (multiple disciplines) has been greatly expanded, in particular, over the last couple of decades.3-4 In the medical field, nanotechnology has emerged to include non-invasive systems for probing of disease and also capable of carrying cargo for localized high concentration delivery, known as \"nanomedicine\", with reduction of off-target effects. The use of nanomaterials, in particular polymeric nanostructures, has demonstrated efficiency in improving delivery of diagnostic and therapeutic agents to the target sites, and the feasibility of incorporating several therapeutic/diagnostic/targeting moieties within specific compartments of the nanoparticles, with control of their navigation in the body and to the target sites. Further understanding of the nature and microenvironments of biological systems (e.g. different pH, temperature, permeability, drainage, or overexpressing proteins, enzymes or receptors), and the barriers towards the delivery of various moieties to their destinations, which could be either intra- or extracellular, has aided the design of nanomaterials that could evade the various physiological barriers. Selective delivery to the site of the disease can increase the therapeutic efficacy, imaging contrast and accuracy, reduce adverse reactions, and reduce the dose and cost of medications. \n \nInitially, platform technologies were the target for nanostructure designs, but with the complications of biological systems, it has been recognized over the past decade that disease- and patient-specific medical treatment is needed for efficacy\u2014this review highlights a few examples developed within the past couple of years, with a focus on in vivo studies together with novel designs and significant advances in syntheses. The advantages of polymeric nanostructures over other types of nanomaterials are based upon the flexibility over which their structures can be modified to yield materials of various compositions, morphologies, sizes, surface properties, with possibility of hierarchical assembly of several nanomaterials of various components into one construct that can be accommodated with a variety of therapeutic, diagnostic and/or targeting moieties, within selective compartments of the nanodevices. High efficiency in diagnosis and treatment of diseases and improving patient quality of life and compliance can be achieved through understanding the molecular events associated with various diseases, and combining the advances in the design of therapeutic and diagnostic agents and nanomaterials, together with the innovative instruments utilized for monitoring these agents. This review will focus on several recent advances in the design of polymeric nanoparticles that have been utilized for delivery of diagnostic and/or therapeutic agents, and the various barriers towards the clinical development of these materials. After a brief overview of the capabilities and challenges with medical imaging and therapy, in general, disease-specific examples of polymer nanoparticles designed specifically to overcome the challenges and address unmet medical needs will be discussed in detail."

Furthermore, the structure of the semiconducting polymeric NPs can be easily engineered in the backbone to introduce donor-acceptors to shift the absorption from NIR I to NIR II window, with enhanced efficacy vs. lower fluence of the laser and higher safety of the treatment (Zhen et al., 2021)(Zhou et al., 2022)",

                            "Photoacoustic (PA) imaging and photothermal therapy (PTT) have attracted extensive attention in disease diagnosis and treatment. Although many exogenous contrast agents have been developed for PA imaging and PTT, the design guidelines to amplify their imaging and therapy performances remain challenging and are highly demanded. Semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) composed of polymers with \u03c0-electron delocalized backbones can be designed to amplify their PA imaging and PTT performance, because of their clear structure-property relation and versatility in modifying their molecular structures to tune their photophysical properties. This review summarizes the recent advances in the photoacoustic imaging and photothermal therapy applications of semiconducting polymer nanoparticles with a focus on signal amplification and second near-infrared (NIR-II, 1000-1700\u00a0nm) construction. The strategies such as structure-property screening, fluorescence quenching, accelerated heat dissipation, and size-dependent heat dissipation are first discussed to amplify the PA brightness of SPNs for in vivo PA. The molecular approaches to shifting the absorption of SPNs for NIR-II PA imaging and PTT are then introduced so as to improve the tissue penetration depth for diagnosis and therapy. At last, current challenges and perspectives of SPNs in the field of imaging and therapy are discussed."

To fully utilize this potential, PA molecular imaging probes have to be developed. Herein we introduce near infrared (NIR) light absorbing semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) as a new class of contrast agents for PA molecular imaging. SPNs can produce stronger signal than commonly used single-wall carbon nanotubes and gold nanorods on a per mass basis, permitting whole-body lymph node PA mapping in living mice at a low systematic injection mass. Furthermore, SPNs possess high structural flexibility, narrow PA spectral profiles, and strong resistance to photodegradation and oxidation, which enables development of the first NIR ratiometric PA probe for in vivo real-time imaging of reactive oxygen species\u2014vital chemical mediators of many diseases. These results demonstrate SPNs an ideal nanoplatform for developing PA molecular probes."

                            "Medical diagnosis and therapy are essential for providing patients with proper care, although inefficient diagnosis and therapy are usually associated with either improper detection of the diseases, unsatisfactory therapeutic outcomes and/or serious adverse reactions. Advances in the design of various diagnostic and therapeutic agents, and the recent trend of utilizing molecules for both therapeutic and diagnostic applications (i.e. theranostics), still have not achieved the maximum benefits of controlling the navigation and biodistribution of these molecules within the biological system. The key challenges towards the use of these agents, from small molecules to macromolecular drugs (e.g. natural, proteins and nucleic acids-based drugs, or synthetic, polymer-based conjugates, carriers or other systems), are, for example, the loss of activity via rapid clearance or degradation, inefficient delivery to the target sites, and inappropriate probing of the disease states, dependent on the particular disease and its location in the body. The concept of nanotechnology has been initiated early in 1959 by Richard Feynman in his famous historical talk at Caltech \"There\u2019s Plenty of Room at the Bottom\", with introduction of the possibility of manipulating materials at the atomic and molecular levels.1 In 1974, Norio Taniguchi, at Tokyo University, first utilized the term \"nanotechnology\" referring to the design of materials on the nanoscale.2 In the early 1990\u2019s and until now, the use of nanomaterials of different nature (organic and inorganic), and for various applications (multiple disciplines) has been greatly expanded, in particular, over the last couple of decades.3-4 In the medical field, nanotechnology has emerged to include non-invasive systems for probing of disease and also capable of carrying cargo for localized high concentration delivery, known as \"nanomedicine\", with reduction of off-target effects. The use of nanomaterials, in particular polymeric nanostructures, has demonstrated efficiency in improving delivery of diagnostic and therapeutic agents to the target sites, and the feasibility of incorporating several therapeutic/diagnostic/targeting moieties within specific compartments of the nanoparticles, with control of their navigation in the body and to the target sites. Further understanding of the nature and microenvironments of biological systems (e.g. different pH, temperature, permeability, drainage, or overexpressing proteins, enzymes or receptors), and the barriers towards the delivery of various moieties to their destinations, which could be either intra- or extracellular, has aided the design of nanomaterials that could evade the various physiological barriers. Selective delivery to the site of the disease can increase the therapeutic efficacy, imaging contrast and accuracy, reduce adverse reactions, and reduce the dose and cost of medications. \n \nInitially, platform technologies were the target for nanostructure designs, but with the complications of biological systems, it has been recognized over the past decade that disease- and patient-specific medical treatment is needed for efficacy\u2014this review highlights a few examples developed within the past couple of years, with a focus on in vivo studies together with novel designs and significant advances in syntheses. The advantages of polymeric nanostructures over other types of nanomaterials are based upon the flexibility over which their structures can be modified to yield materials of various compositions, morphologies, sizes, surface properties, with possibility of hierarchical assembly of several nanomaterials of various components into one construct that can be accommodated with a variety of therapeutic, diagnostic and/or targeting moieties, within selective compartments of the nanodevices. High efficiency in diagnosis and treatment of diseases and improving patient quality of life and compliance can be achieved through understanding the molecular events associated with various diseases, and combining the advances in the design of therapeutic and diagnostic agents and nanomaterials, together with the innovative instruments utilized for monitoring these agents. This review will focus on several recent advances in the design of polymeric nanoparticles that have been utilized for delivery of diagnostic and/or therapeutic agents, and the various barriers towards the clinical development of these materials. After a brief overview of the capabilities and challenges with medical imaging and therapy, in general, disease-specific examples of polymer nanoparticles designed specifically to overcome the challenges and address unmet medical needs will be discussed in detail."

                            "Abstract Biosensors are analytical devices which find extensive applications in fields such as the food industry, defense sector, environmental monitoring, and in clinical diagnosis. Similarly, intrinsically conducting polymers (ICPs) and their composites have lured immense interest in bio\u2010sensing due to their various attributes like compatibility with biological molecules, efficient electron transfer upon biochemical reactions, loading of bio\u2010reagent, and immobilization of biomolecules. Further, they are proficient in sensing diverse biological species and compounds like glucose (detection limit \u22480.18 nm), DNA (\u224810 pm), cholesterol (\u22481 \u00b5m), aptamer (\u22480.8 pm), and also cancer cells (\u22485 pm mL\u22121) making them a potential candidate for biological sensing functions. ICPs and their composites have been extensively exploited by researchers in the field of biosensors owing to these peculiarities; however, no consolidated literature on the usage of conducting polymer composites for biosensing functions is available. This review extensively elucidates on ICP composites and doped conjugated polymers for biosensing functions of copious biological species. In addition, a brief overview is provided on various forms of biosensors, their sensing mechanisms, and various methods of immobilizing biological species along with the life cycle assessment of biosensors for various biosensing applications, and their cost analysis."

                            "Cancer therapy is routinely performed in the clinic to cure cancer and control its progression, wherein therapeutic agents are generally used. To reduce side effects, protherapeutic agents that can be activated by overexpressed cancer biomarkers are under development. However, these agents still face certain extent of off-target activation in normal tissues, stimulating the interest to design external-stimuli activatable protherapeutics. In this regard, photoactivatable protherapeutic agents have been utilized for cancer treatments. However, because of the intrinsic features of photolabile moieties, most photoactivatable protherapeutic agents only respond to ultraviolet-visible light, limiting their in vivo applications. Thus, protherapeutic agents that can be activated by near-infrared (NIR) light with minimal phototoxicity and increased tissue penetration are highly desired. In this Account, we summarize our semiconducting polymer nanomaterials (SPNs) as NIR photoactivatable protherapeutic agents for cancer treatment. SPNs are transformed from \u03c0-conjugated polymers that efficiently convert NIR light into heat or singlet oxygen (1O2). With photothermal and photodynamic properties, SPNs can be directly used as photomedicine or serve as light transducers to activate heat or 1O2-responsive protherapeutic agents. The heat-activatable SPN-based protherapeutic agents are developed by loading or conjugating of SPNs with therapeutic agents (e.g., agonist, gene, and enzyme). For instance, photothermally triggered release of agonists specifically activates certain protein ion channels on the cellular membrane, leading to ion overinflux induced mitochondria dysfunction and consequently apoptosis of cancer cells. Moreover, photothermal activation of temperature-sensitive bromelain can promote the in situ degradation of collagens (the major components of extracellular matrix), resulting in an improved accumulation of agents in tumor tissues and thus amplified therapeutic outcome. The 1O2-activatable SPN-based protherapeutic agents are constructed through covalent conjugation of SPNs with caged therapeutic agents via hypoxia- or 1O2-cleavable linkers. Upon NIR photoirradiation, SPNs consume oxygen to generate 1O2, which leads to photodynamic therapy (PDT), and meanwhile breaks hypoxia- or 1O2-cleavable linkers for on-demand release and in situ activation of caged protherapeutic molecules (e.g., chemodrug, enzyme, and inhibitor). Such remote activation of SPN-based protherapeutic agents can be applied to induce DNA damage, ribonucleic acid degradation, inhibition of protein biosynthesis, or immune system activation in tumors of living animals. By synergizing PDT with NIR photoactivation of those biological actions, these protherapeutic agents effectively eliminate tumors and even fully inhibit tumor metastasis. This Account highlights the potential of SPNs for construction of versatile NIR photoactivatable protherapeutics to treat cancer at designated times and locations with high therapeutic outcome and precision."

Their delocalized \u03c0-electron systems contribute to their remarkable optical features, which can be further amplified through structural engineering to enhance photoacoustic brightness for improved in vivo imaging sensitivity <Paper corpusId=\"250996126\" paperTitle=\"(Hui et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.

When designed to absorb in the second near-infrared window (NIR-II), these materials demonstrate excellent photoacoustic and photothermal performance while maintaining high photostability <Paper corpusId=\"220371348\" paperTitle=\"(Wen et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"276809915\" paperTitle=\"(Rizwan et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>.

The ability of these materials to maintain consistent signal output during extended imaging sessions provides reliable data for assessing disease progression and treatment response, addressing a significant limitation of conventional fluorescent probes that suffer from photobleaching during prolonged use.\n\nMoreover, the excellent photostability of SPNs contributes to their emerging role as theranostic platforms. When combined with therapeutic agents, these nanoparticles can simultaneously provide high-quality imaging for tumor detection and deliver targeted treatment, with their sustained signal output enabling real-time monitoring of therapeutic efficacy <Paper corpusId=\"272668437\" paperTitle=\"(Yin et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"265229155\" paperTitle=\"(Kumar et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.

To fully utilize this potential, PA molecular imaging probes have to be developed. Herein we introduce near infrared (NIR) light absorbing semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) as a new class of contrast agents for PA molecular imaging. SPNs can produce stronger signal than commonly used single-wall carbon nanotubes and gold nanorods on a per mass basis, permitting whole-body lymph node PA mapping in living mice at a low systematic injection mass. Furthermore, SPNs possess high structural flexibility, narrow PA spectral profiles, and strong resistance to photodegradation and oxidation, which enables development of the first NIR ratiometric PA probe for in vivo real-time imaging of reactive oxygen species\u2014vital chemical mediators of many diseases. These results demonstrate SPNs an ideal nanoplatform for developing PA molecular probes."

Besides, the restricted absorption in the first near-infrared window (NIR-I) of most existing nano-agents compromises their effectiveness for deep tissue PAI and PTT. We herein develop novel semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) that are strongly absorptive in the second near-infrared window (NIR-II) to alleviate these problems. With the merits of excellent photoacoustic and photothermal performance, high photostability, proper size, and low toxicity, SPNs not only show efficient cellular uptake for PAI and PTT toward U87 glioma cells but also demonstrate effective accumulation in both subcutaneous tumor and brain tumor upon intravenous injection, thereby realizing efficient PAI-guided PTT toward gliomas under NIR-II light irradiation."

These nanoparticles, utilizing electron donor and acceptor pairs with \u03c0-conjugated polymer backbones, exhibit excellent photostability, NIR absorption and enhanced PA effects in brain tumor imaging (Hu et al., 2024). Fan et al. established perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic diimide (PDI) nanoparticles, featuring a tertiary amine electron donor and a diimide electron acceptor, for deep brain tumor imaging (Fig. 10a) (Fan et al., 2015). Modified with DSPE-mPEG 5000 for water stability, these PDI nanoparticles showed enhanced PA signals in animal models with orthotopic glioblastoma upon continuous 700 nm laser irradiation, highlighting their efficacy through EPR effect and low toxicity (Fig. 10b)."

Their integration of diagnostic and therapeutic functions creates powerful theranostic platforms that permit real-time monitoring of treatment efficacy while delivering targeted photodynamic and photothermal therapies.

                "text": "\nSemiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) demonstrate exceptional utility in multimodal imaging applications, enabling comprehensive tumor visualization through complementary imaging modalities. These versatile materials can be engineered to simultaneously provide fluorescence, photoacoustic (PA), and chemiluminescence imaging capabilities, offering multidimensional information about tumor location, morphology, and biological characteristics <Paper corpusId=\"254688030\" paperTitle=\"(Huang et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. This multimodal functionality is particularly valuable for improving diagnostic accuracy, as different imaging techniques can compensate for the limitations of individual modalities while providing synergistic information about tumor biology.\n\nThe integration of diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities within a single SPN platform represents a significant advancement over traditional tumor detection materials. These theranostic nanoagents combine imaging functionality with therapeutic modalities such as photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT), enabling simultaneous tumor detection and treatment <Paper corpusId=\"246066001\" paperTitle=\"(Yuan et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. For instance, oligopeptide-based SPNs have been developed with both NIR-II fluorescence and NIR-I PA dual-modal imaging capabilities that guide subsequent PTT and PDT therapies, creating a comprehensive cancer treatment platform <Paper corpusId=\"246066001\" paperTitle=\"(Yuan et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nParticularly notable is the transformation of semiconducting polymers into functional carbon dot imaging agents through hydrothermal carbonization. For example, poly(thiophene)-based derivatives can be converted from sheet-like structures into water-dispersible carbon dots that provide simultaneous fluorescence imaging under visible light excitation and PA imaging under NIR irradiation, while also demonstrating high photon-to-heat conversion efficiency for photothermal therapy in living mice <Paper corpusId=\"238742619\" paperTitle=\"(Jeong et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. This multimodal functionality from a single nanoplatform represents a significant advantage over conventional imaging materials that typically provide only single-mode visualization.\n\nThe theranostic capabilities of SPNs have been further enhanced through biomimetic targeting approaches. For instance, activated fibroblast cell membrane-coated SPNs (AF-SPNs) specifically target cancer-associated fibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment, leading to enhanced tumor accumulation and stronger NIR fluorescence and PA signals compared to uncoated counterparts <Paper corpusId=\"254688030\" paperTitle=\"(Huang et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"51909178\" paperTitle=\"(Li et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>. This biomimetic targeting not only improves diagnostic imaging but also enhances therapeutic efficacy by enabling more precise delivery of photothermal and photodynamic treatments to tumor sites.\n\nA significant advantage of SPN-based theranostic platforms is their ability to respond to specific tumor microenvironment characteristics. Some SPNs have been designed as oxygen-sensitive afterglow imaging agents that can detect hypoxic conditions in tumors, allowing visualization of tiny peritoneal metastatic tumors that might otherwise be undetectable <Paper corpusId=\"254688030\" paperTitle=\"(Huang et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"51922576\" paperTitle=\"(Cui et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>. This capability for activatable imaging provides real-time information about tumor biology beyond simple anatomical visualization, offering valuable insights for treatment planning and monitoring.\n\nFurthermore, recent advances have led to the development of self-sacrificially biodegradable pseudo-semiconducting polymers that combine NIR-II fluorescence bioimaging with photodynamic immunotherapy and photoactivated chemotherapy <Paper corpusId=\"254688030\" paperTitle=\"(Huang et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"250453957\" paperTitle=\"(Tang et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. These systems can co-assemble with amphiphilic polyesters containing pendant chemotherapeutic agents linked via reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive bonds, enabling light-triggered drug release for combination therapy while providing simultaneous imaging capabilities.\n\nThe metabolizable nature of some SPN formulations addresses potential toxicity concerns associated with nanomaterials. These biodegradable SPNs can be cleared through renal and hepatobiliary pathways after fulfilling their imaging and therapeutic functions, minimizing long-term accumulation in the body <Paper corpusId=\"271282317\" paperTitle=\"(Neelamraju et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"58648939\" paperTitle=\"(Jiang et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. Despite their clearance capabilities, these nanoagents maintain excellent photothermal conversion efficiency and emit strong signals in the NIR-II window, providing sensitive imaging of deep brain vasculature and subcutaneous tumors at low systemic dosages.\n\nThe clinical significance of these multimodal theranostic platforms extends beyond tumor detection to include personalized medicine applications. The ability of SPN-based biosensors to rapidly detect cancer biomarkers could be critical for selecting personalized treatment options based on the molecular fingerprint of a patient's disease, as well as for monitoring treatment effectiveness and disease recurrence during and after therapy <Paper corpusId=\"201099989\" paperTitle=\"(Runsewe et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. This integration of diagnostic and therapeutic functionalities within a single platform represents a paradigm shift toward more precise and personalized cancer management.\n\nThe versatility of SPNs is further exemplified by their application in various theranostic configurations, including thiadiazoloquinoxaline (TQ)-based SPNs designed for NIR-II fluorescence imaging-guided cancer photothermal therapy <Paper corpusId=\"247160239\" paperTitle=\"(Fan et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. Additionally, intelligent drug delivery systems have been developed using SPNs, such as PDPP3T@PSNiAA-Dox nanoparticles that demonstrate NIR-triggered drug release specifically under acidic tumor conditions, minimizing drug release in normal tissues and resulting in complete tumor elimination without recurrence in animal models <Paper corpusId=\"253274990\" paperTitle=\"(He et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"31038259\" paperTitle=\"(Zhou et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe incorporation of electron-deficient units into semiconducting polymer backbones has enabled the development of self-quenched SPNs that amplify PA imaging signals by 1.7-fold in live mice, enhancing tumor delineation by 4.7-fold after systemic administration <Paper corpusId=\"271282317\" paperTitle=\"(Neelamraju et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. These structural modifications not only improve imaging performance but also enhance therapeutic efficacy, demonstrating how molecular engineering of semiconducting polymers can create increasingly sophisticated multimodal theranostic platforms for comprehensive cancer management.",

                            "Phototheranostic nanoagents are promising for early diagnosis and precision therapy of cancer. However, their imaging ability and therapeutic efficacy are often limited due to the presence of delivery barriers in the tumor microenvironment. Herein, we report the development of organic multimodal phototheranostic nanoagents that can biomimetically target cancer-associated fibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment for enhanced multimodal imaging-guided cancer therapy. Such biomimetic nanocamouflages comprise a near-infrared (NIR) absorbing semiconducting polymer nanoparticle (SPN) coated with the cell membranes of activated fibroblasts. The homologous targeting mechanism allows the activated fibroblast cell membrane coated SPN (AF-SPN) to specifically target cancer-associated fibroblasts, leading to enhanced tumor accumulation relative to the uncoated and cancer cell membrane coated counterparts after systemic administration in living mice. As such, AF-SPN not only provides stronger NIR fluorescence and photoacoustic signals to detect tumors but also generates enhanced cytotoxic heat and singlet oxygen to exert combinational photothermal and photodynamic therapy, ultimately leading to an antitumor efficacy higher than that of the counterparts.

                            "The fact that cancer metastasis is the main cause of death for most cancer patients necessitates the development of imaging tools for sensitive detection of metastases. Although optical imaging has high temporospatial resolution, tissue autofluorescence compromises the sensitivity for in vivo imaging of cancer metastasis. Herein, the synthesis of a series of photosensitizer\u2010incorporated poly(p\u2010phenylenevinylene)\u2010based semiconducting copolymers and their utility as near\u2010infrared (NIR) afterglow imaging nanoagents that emit light after cessation of light irradiation are reported. As compared with nondoped nanoparticles, the nanoparticles derived from the photosensitizer\u2010incorporated copolymers have red\u2010shifted NIR luminescence and amplified afterglow signals, allowing the detection of tiny peritoneal metastatic tumors almost invisible to naked eye. Moreover, the intrinsic oxygen\u2010sensitive nature of afterglow makes those nanoagents potentially useful for in vivo imaging of oxygen levels. Thus, this study introduces a generation of light\u2010excitation\u2010free background\u2010minimized optical imaging agents for the sensitive detection of diseased tissues in vivo."

                            "Semiconducting polymers (SP) hold great promise for cancer phototherapy due to their excellent optical properties; however, their clinical application is still hampered by their poor biodegradability. Herein, a self\u2010sacrificially biodegradable pseudo\u2010semiconducting polymer (PSP) for NIR\u2010II fluorescence bioimaging, photodynamic immunotherapy, and photoactivated chemotherapy (PACT) is reported. The PSP can further co\u2010assemble with an amphiphilic polyester with pendant doxorubicin (DOX) in its side chains via reactive oxygen species (ROS)\u2010responsive thioketal linkages (PEDOX), which are denoted as NP@PEDOX/PSP. The NP@PEDOX/PSP can accumulate at tumor sites and generate ROS for photodynamic immunotherapy as well as near\u2010infrared\u2010II fluorescence (NIR\u2010II) for bioimaging upon irradition at 808 nm. The ROS could break up thioketal linkages in PEDOX, resulting in rapid doxorubicin (DOX) release for PACT. Finally, both PEDOX and PSP are degraded sacrificially by intracellular glutathione (GSH), resulting in the dissociation of NP@PEDOX/PSP. This work highlights the application of self\u2010sacrificially degradable PSP for NIR\u2010II fluorescence bioimaging, photodynamic immunotherapy, and PACT in cancer therapy."

Herein, the first series of metabolizable NIR\u2010II PA agents are reported based on semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs). Such completely organic nanoagents consist of \u03c0\u2010conjugated yet oxidizable optical polymer as PA generator and hydrolyzable amphiphilic polymer as particle matrix to provide water solubility. The obtained SPNs are readily degraded by myeloperoxidase and lipase abundant in phagocytes, transforming from nonfluorescent nanoparticles (30 nm) into NIR fluorescent ultrasmall metabolites (\u22481 nm). As such, these nanoagents can be effectively cleared out via both hepatobiliary and renal excretions after systematic administration, leaving no toxicity to living mice. Particularly these nanoagents possess high photothermal conversion efficiencies and emit bright PA signals at 1064 nm, enabling sensitive NIR\u2010II PA imaging of both subcutaneous tumor and deep brain vasculature through intact skull in living animals at a low systematic dosage. This study thus provides a generalized molecular design toward organic metabolizable semiconducting materials for biophotonic applications in NIR\u2010II window."

The authors review recent advances of thiadiazoloquinoxaline (TQ)-based SPNs from their synthesis and hydrophilic functionalization to NIR-II (1,000\u20131,700 nm) fluorescence imagingguided cancer photothermal therapy (PTT). To enhance the PTT efficiency, they also discuss methods for constructing SPNs with capability of multimodal imaging."

Owing to their large absorption coefficients, tunable optical properties, and high photostability, SPNs have recently been used to improve the sensitivity and resolution of photoacoustic (PA) imaging. In particular, a number of strategies have been explored to design activatable SPNs for amplified in vivo PA imaging. In this review, the recent advances in the development of SPNs as exogenous PA contrasts agents have been summarized and their promising potential as multifunctional probes for cancer theranostics has been discussed.
