This new antibody-based molecular platform enables selective delivery of a potent cytotoxic payload to target cancer cells, resulting in improved efficacy, reduced systemic toxicity, and preferable pharmacokinetics (PK)/pharmacodynamics (PD) and biodistribution compared to traditional chemotherapy. Boosted by the successes of FDA-approved Adcetris\u00ae and Kadcyla\u00ae, this drug class has been rapidly growing along with about 60 ADCs currently in clinical trials. In this article, we briefly review molecular aspects of each component (the antibody, payload, and linker) of ADCs, and then mainly discuss traditional and new technologies of the conjugation and linker chemistries for successful construction of clinically effective ADCs. Current efforts in the conjugation and linker chemistries will provide greater insights into molecular design and strategies for clinically effective ADCs from medicinal chemistry and pharmacology standpoints. The development of site-specific conjugation methodologies for constructing homogeneous ADCs is an especially promising path to improving ADC design, which will open the way for novel cancer therapeutics.",

The linker moiety covalently tethers the antibody and payload components. Its molecular design and properties are critical determinant factors for ADC efficacy in terms of pharmacokinetics (PK)/pharmacodynamics (PD) and therapeutic window. To maximize these parameters, various types of linkers have been developed and evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Several criteria must be met for successful ADC construction. (1) The linker needs to possess sufficient stability in plasma so that ADC molecules can circulate in the bloodstream and localize to the tumor site without premature cleavage. Instability of the linker causes premature liberation of the toxic payload and undesired damage to non-target healthy cells, which can lead to systemic toxicity and adverse effects. However, a clinical study revealed reverse correlation between linker stability of maytansinoid-based ADCs and adverse toxicity (Drake and Rabuka, 2015). Therefore, it is important to identify ADC linkers with optimal linker stability for each combination of antigen, target tumor type, and payload. (2) At the same time, the linker needs to possess the ability to be rapidly cleaved and to release free and toxic payload once the ADC is internalized into the target tumor cell. (3) Another property to be considered in the linker design is hydrophobicity. Hydrophobic linkers coupled with hydrophobic payloads often promote aggregation of ADC molecules. For example, King and co-workers observed non-covalent dimerization of the monoclonal antibody BR96 conjugated with doxorubicin through a multi-loading, hydrophobic dipeptide linker (King et al., 2002). Such molecules are unfavorable in the pursuit of therapeutically useful ADCs; aggregated proteins tend to be rapidly sequestered in the liver and cleared by the reticuloendothelial system, resulting in hepatotoxicity (Finbloom et al., 1980). In addition, aggregated proteins are likely",

An\n## Abstract\nThe antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), a humanized or human monoclonal antibody conjugated with highly cytotoxic small molecules (payloads) through chemical linkers, is a novel therapeutic format and has great potential to make a paradigm shift in cancer chemotherapy. This new antibody-based molecular platform enables selective delivery of a potent cytotoxic payload to target cancer cells, resulting in improved efficacy, reduced systemic toxicity, and preferable pharmacokinetics (PK)/pharmacodynamics (PD) and biodistribution compared to traditional chemotherapy. Boosted by the successes of FDA-approved Adcetris\u00ae and Kadcyla\u00ae, this drug class has been rapidly growing along with about 60 ADCs currently in clinical trials. In this article, we briefly review molecular aspects of each component (the antibody, payload, and linker) of ADCs, and then mainly discuss traditional and new technologies of the conjugation and linker chemistries for successful construction of clinically effective ADCs. Current efforts in the conjugation and linker chemistries will provide greater insights into molecular design and strategies for clinically effective ADCs from medicinal chemistry and pharmacology standpoints. The development of site-specific conjugation methodologies for constructing homogeneous ADCs is an especially promising path to improving ADC design, which will open the way for novel cancer therapeutics.\n## THE CONJUGATION AND LINKER CHEMISTRIES FOR ADC\nThough it is important to select optimal target-specific antibodies and potent payloads based on type of cancer cells, the conjugation and linker chemistries are also crucial components for successful construction of an ADC and the major topics of this review. The linker moiety covalently tethers the antibody and payload components. Its molecular design and properties are critical determinant factors for ADC efficacy in terms of pharmacokinetics (PK)/pharmacodynamics (PD) and therapeutic window. To maximize these parameters, various types of linkers have been developed and evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Several criteria must be met for successful ADC construction. (1) The linker needs to possess sufficient stability in plasma so that ADC molecules can circulate in the bloodstream and localize to the tumor site without premature cleavage. Instability of the linker causes premature liberation of the toxic payload and undesired damage to non-target healthy cells, which can lead to systemic toxicity and adverse effects. However, a clinical study revealed reverse correlation between linker stability of maytansinoid-based ADCs and adverse toxicity (Drake and Rabuka, 2015). Therefore, it is important to identify ADC linkers with optimal linker stability for each combination of antigen, target tumor type, and payload. (2) At the same time, the linker needs to possess the ability to be rapidly cleaved and to release free and toxic payload once the ADC is internalized into the target tumor cell. (3) Another property to be considered in the linker design is hydrophobicity. Hydrophobic linkers coupled with hydrophobic payloads often promote aggregation of ADC molecules. For example, King and co-workers observed non-covalent dimerization of the monoclonal antibody BR96 conjugated with doxorubicin through a multi-loading, hydrophobic dipeptide linker (King et al., 2002). Such molecules are unfavorable in the pursuit of therapeutically useful ADCs; aggregated proteins tend to be rapidly sequestered in the liver and cleared by the reticuloendothelial system, resulting in hepatotoxicity (Finbloom et al., 1980). In addition, aggregated proteins are likely",

            "abstract": "Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide due to high heterogeneity. Although chemotherapy remains the mainstay of cancer therapy, non-selective toxicity and drug resistance of mono-chemotherapy incur broad criticisms. Subsequently, various combination strategies have been developed to improve clinical efficacy, also known as cocktail therapy. However, conventional \u201ccocktail administration\u201d is just passable, due to the potential toxicities to normal tissues and unsatisfactory synergistic effects, especially for the combined drugs with different pharmacokinetic properties. The drug conjugates through coupling the conventional chemotherapeutics to a carrier (such as antibody and peptide) provide an alternative strategy to improve therapeutic efficacy and simultaneously reduce the unspecific toxicities, by virtue of the advantages of highly specific targeting ability and potent killing effect. Although 14 antibody\u2013drug conjugates (ADCs) have been approved worldwide and more are being investigated in clinical trials so far, several limitations have been disclosed during clinical application. Compared with ADCs, peptide-drug conjugates (PDCs) possess several advantages, including easy industrial synthesis, low cost, high tissue penetration and fast clearance. So far, only a handful of PDCs have been approved, highlighting tremendous\u00a0development\u00a0potential. Herein, we discuss the progress and pitfalls in the development of ADCs and underline what can learn from ADCs for the better construction of PDCs in the future.",

                    "text": "The choice of suitable linkers is likewise the challenge for the development of effective ADCs. As a small and central part of ADCs, a linker is designed to be stable in the bloodstream and subsequently release the drug in its active form within or close to the target cells [32,33]. The role of linker is fundamental for efficient delivery of the cytotoxic drug, but it is also the determinant factor to the toxicity of an ADC product. Premature release of drugs in the circulation can result in systemic toxicity and a lower therapeutic index. \n\nNeutropenia is a kind of common toxicity for many ADCs conjugated to MMAE via protease cleavable valine-citrulline linkers such as Brentuximab vedotin, ASG-5ME, Glembatumumab vedotin, Indusatumab vedotin, Polatuzumab vedotin and PSMA-targeting ADC [20,[34][35][36][37][38]. Results showed that vc-MMAE-based ADC-induced neutropenia is due to a direct cytotoxic effect of released payload on differentiated neutrophils in the bone marrow [39]. Peripheral neuropathy is another important target-independent clinical toxicity associated with microtubule inhibitor ADCs leading to treatment discontinuation and/or dose reduction [40]. Microtubule inhibitors disrupt interphase microtubule function critical for the active transport of key essential proteins from the neuron cell body to distal synapses and ultimately result in peripheral neuropathy [41]. \n\nThe mechanism of drug release is an important consideration in linker selection. Both cleavable and non-cleavable linkers have been used in approved second-generation ADCs and in third-generation ADCs that are currently being investigated in clinical trials [42,43]. Collectively, linker stability during several days in the circulation and efficient cleavage upon delivery into the target cell, should be considered for effective linker design.",

Although chemotherapy remains the mainstay of cancer therapy, non-selective toxicity and drug resistance of mono-chemotherapy incur broad criticisms. Subsequently, various combination strategies have been developed to improve clinical efficacy, also known as cocktail therapy. However, conventional \u201ccocktail administration\u201d is just passable, due to the potential toxicities to normal tissues and unsatisfactory synergistic effects, especially for the combined drugs with different pharmacokinetic properties. The drug conjugates through coupling the conventional chemotherapeutics to a carrier (such as antibody and peptide) provide an alternative strategy to improve therapeutic efficacy and simultaneously reduce the unspecific toxicities, by virtue of the advantages of highly specific targeting ability and potent killing effect. Although 14 antibody\u2013drug conjugates (ADCs) have been approved worldwide and more are being investigated in clinical trials so far, several limitations have been disclosed during clinical application. Compared with ADCs, peptide-drug conjugates (PDCs) possess several advantages, including easy industrial synthesis, low cost, high tissue penetration and fast clearance. So far, only a handful of PDCs have been approved, highlighting tremendous\u00a0development\u00a0potential. Herein, we discuss the progress and pitfalls in the development of ADCs and underline what can learn from ADCs for the better construction of PDCs in the future.\n## Linker instability-associated toxicity\nThe choice of suitable linkers is likewise the challenge for the development of effective ADCs. As a small and central part of ADCs, a linker is designed to be stable in the bloodstream and subsequently release the drug in its active form within or close to the target cells [32,33]. The role of linker is fundamental for efficient delivery of the cytotoxic drug, but it is also the determinant factor to the toxicity of an ADC product. Premature release of drugs in the circulation can result in systemic toxicity and a lower therapeutic index. \n\nNeutropenia is a kind of common toxicity for many ADCs conjugated to MMAE via protease cleavable valine-citrulline linkers such as Brentuximab vedotin, ASG-5ME, Glembatumumab vedotin, Indusatumab vedotin, Polatuzumab vedotin and PSMA-targeting ADC [20,[34][35][36][37][38]. Results showed that vc-MMAE-based ADC-induced neutropenia is due to a direct cytotoxic effect of released payload on differentiated neutrophils in the bone marrow [39]. Peripheral neuropathy is another important target-independent clinical toxicity associated with microtubule inhibitor ADCs leading to treatment discontinuation and/or dose reduction [40]. Microtubule inhibitors disrupt interphase microtubule function critical for the active transport of key essential proteins from the neuron cell body to distal synapses and ultimately result in peripheral neuropathy [41]. \n\nThe mechanism of drug release is an important consideration in linker selection. Both cleavable and non-cleavable linkers have been used in approved second-generation ADCs and in third-generation ADCs that are currently being investigated in clinical trials [42,43]. Collectively, linker stability during several days in the circulation and efficient cleavage upon delivery into the target cell, should be considered for effective linker design.",

However, protein therapeutics cannot drug targets intracellularly and are limited to soluble and cell-surface antigens. Tremendous strides have been made in antibody discovery, protein engineering, formulation, and delivery devices. These advances continue to push the boundaries of biologics to enable antibody conjugates to take advantage of the target specificity and long half-life from an antibody, while delivering highly potent small molecule drugs.

The stability of the linker to premature release of the payload in the systemic circulation has been demonstrated to be a critical ADC ADME component for determining the exposure-response and exposure-toxicity relationships [141]. From a stability perspective, well-behaved ADCs should only release the payload in the intended target tissue to minimize payload toxicity to unintended tissue and maximize efficacy in target tissues/organs, especially with payloads with cytotoxic properties. The ADC linker stability is noted to be a challenge due to the long circulating half-life (days to weeks) imparted by the mAb component resulting in the continuous assault of the linker to endogenous proteases. Mechanistically, linker stability can be evaluated both in vitro using plasma/serum incubations and in vivo following administration to multiple species by following the formation of the released payload and DAR changes over time. As covered above, linker composition continues to be an intense area of focus in the development of ADCs. In terms of the payload, initial reports with limited chemical entities suggested that type of payloads did not impact the PK of ADCs; however, more recent studies of conjugation sites and of site-specific conjugations have demonstrated the connectivity of the site of conjugation with various payloads to impact ADC PK and disposition [142,143]. Engineering ADCs for site-specific conjugation to control the DAR and PK has shown some evidence of improving the TI in non-clinical oncology studies [144]. Approaches such as engineered cysteines, unnatural amino acids, and the inclusion of tags (i.e., selenocysteine, aldehyde, or glutamine) continue to be intense areas of research for the application of site-specific payload conjugation to optimize ADC ADME. \n\nLike mAbs, ADCs are likely trafficked via the vascular and lymphatic systems. The biodistribution of ADCs follows that of the antibody component.",

Liu, Ruben M Martinez, A. Datta-Mannan, Yiqing Feng\n## Abstract\nMonoclonal antibodies have evolved from research tools to powerful therapeutics in the past 30 years. Clinical success rates of antibodies have exceeded expectations, resulting in heavy investment in biologics discovery and development in addition to traditional small molecules across the industry. However, protein therapeutics cannot drug targets intracellularly and are limited to soluble and cell-surface antigens. Tremendous strides have been made in antibody discovery, protein engineering, formulation, and delivery devices. These advances continue to push the boundaries of biologics to enable antibody conjugates to take advantage of the target specificity and long half-life from an antibody, while delivering highly potent small molecule drugs. While the \u201cmagic bullet\u201d concept produced the first wave of antibody conjugates, these entities were met with limited clinical success. This review summarizes the advances and challenges in the field to date with emphasis on antibody conjugation, linker-payload chemistry, novel payload classes, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME), and product developability. We discuss lessons learned in the development of oncology antibody conjugates and look towards future innovations enabling other therapeutic indications.\n## Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion (ADME) of ADCs\nIn addition to the antibody, the linker and payload components of ADCs are also subject to their own clearance mechanisms. The stability of the linker to premature release of the payload in the systemic circulation has been demonstrated to be a critical ADC ADME component for determining the exposure-response and exposure-toxicity relationships [141]. From a stability perspective, well-behaved ADCs should only release the payload in the intended target tissue to minimize payload toxicity to unintended tissue and maximize efficacy in target tissues/organs, especially with payloads with cytotoxic properties. The ADC linker stability is noted to be a challenge due to the long circulating half-life (days to weeks) imparted by the mAb component resulting in the continuous assault of the linker to endogenous proteases. Mechanistically, linker stability can be evaluated both in vitro using plasma/serum incubations and in vivo following administration to multiple species by following the formation of the released payload and DAR changes over time. As covered above, linker composition continues to be an intense area of focus in the development of ADCs. In terms of the payload, initial reports with limited chemical entities suggested that type of payloads did not impact the PK of ADCs; however, more recent studies of conjugation sites and of site-specific conjugations have demonstrated the connectivity of the site of conjugation with various payloads to impact ADC PK and disposition [142,143]. Engineering ADCs for site-specific conjugation to control the DAR and PK has shown some evidence of improving the TI in non-clinical oncology studies [144]. Approaches such as engineered cysteines, unnatural amino acids, and the inclusion of tags (i.e., selenocysteine, aldehyde, or glutamine) continue to be intense areas of research for the application of site-specific payload conjugation to optimize ADC ADME. \n\nLike mAbs, ADCs are likely trafficked via the vascular and lymphatic systems. The biodistribution of ADCs follows that of the antibody component.",

In comparison with cleavable linkers, non-cleavable linkers were found to have improved stability in the bloodstream allowing ADCs with such linkers to have longer half-lives and pose a reduced risk from side effects while retaining the activity of the cytotoxic drug [127]. This knowledge was reflected in the clinical development of T-DM1, originally designed to have a valine-citrulline dipeptide linker but was instead produced with a non-cleavable thioether linker [128]. Despite the successful use of non-cleavable linkers, it is important to note that their dependence on lysosomal degradation means they can only be used in ADCs targeting antigens that undergo efficient intracellular internalization.\n\nOnce an optimal linker for a particular ADC is chosen, it is important to determine the ideal number of drugs to be conjugated to a mAb [i.e., the drug-antibody ratio (DAR)]. Because of potential linker instability and poor ADC internalization, several drugs are required to be linked to each mAb to achieve adequate cytotoxicity. On the other hand, excessive drug conjugation might result in increased clearance and/or immunogenicity as the ADC is more likely to aggregate and be recognized as a damaged, malformed or foreign protein [129]. In a study conducted by Hamblett et al. [130], the in vivo efficacy of ADCs containing four drugs per antibody was found to be equivalent to that of ADCs with eight drugs per mAb. Heavily modified ADCs (i.e., those with eight conjugated drugs) were associated with increased . . toxicity and underwent faster clearance from the circulation. Additionally, it was found that ADCs containing only two drugs per mAb had a much wider therapeutic window and therefore a higher maximum tolerated dose. The study consequently concluded that ADCs loaded with 2-4 drugs per mAb achieved the best balance between slow clearance and maximal potency [130].\n\nA critical aspect of linker function is the presence or absence of a phenomenon known as the by",

Brown\n## Abstract\nAntibody drug conjugates (ADCs) are an efficacious class of anti-cancer drugs that comprise monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) conjugated to small-molecule cytotoxic agent via a stable linker. This review summarizes the current knowledge and developments in the field of ADCs.\n## Linkers\nto the linker and cytotoxin. The resulting amino acidlinker-cytotoxin complex is released into the cytoplasm and subsequently becomes the active drug. In comparison with cleavable linkers, non-cleavable linkers were found to have improved stability in the bloodstream allowing ADCs with such linkers to have longer half-lives and pose a reduced risk from side effects while retaining the activity of the cytotoxic drug [127]. This knowledge was reflected in the clinical development of T-DM1, originally designed to have a valine-citrulline dipeptide linker but was instead produced with a non-cleavable thioether linker [128]. Despite the successful use of non-cleavable linkers, it is important to note that their dependence on lysosomal degradation means they can only be used in ADCs targeting antigens that undergo efficient intracellular internalization.\n\nOnce an optimal linker for a particular ADC is chosen, it is important to determine the ideal number of drugs to be conjugated to a mAb [i.e., the drug-antibody ratio (DAR)]. Because of potential linker instability and poor ADC internalization, several drugs are required to be linked to each mAb to achieve adequate cytotoxicity. On the other hand, excessive drug conjugation might result in increased clearance and/or immunogenicity as the ADC is more likely to aggregate and be recognized as a damaged, malformed or foreign protein [129]. In a study conducted by Hamblett et al. [130], the in vivo efficacy of ADCs containing four drugs per antibody was found to be equivalent to that of ADCs with eight drugs per mAb. Heavily modified ADCs (i.e., those with eight conjugated drugs) were associated with increased . . toxicity and underwent faster clearance from the circulation. Additionally, it was found that ADCs containing only two drugs per mAb had a much wider therapeutic window and therefore a higher maximum tolerated dose. The study consequently concluded that ADCs loaded with 2-4 drugs per mAb achieved the best balance between slow clearance and maximal potency [130].\n\nA critical aspect of linker function is the presence or absence of a phenomenon known as the by",

Unlike conventional chemotherapeutic drug-based therapies, that are mainly associated with modest specificity and therapeutic benefit, the three key components that form an ADC (a monoclonal antibody bound to a cytotoxic drug via a chemical linker moiety) achieve remarkable improvement in terms of targeted killing of cancer cells and, while sparing healthy tissues, a reduction in systemic side effects caused by off-tumor toxicity. Based on their beneficial mechanism of action, 15 ADCs have been approved to date by the market approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and/or other international governmental agencies for use in clinical oncology, and hundreds are undergoing evaluation in the preclinical and clinical phases. Here, our aim is to provide a comprehensive overview of the key features revolving around ADC therapeutic strategy including their structural and targeting properties, mechanism of action, the role of the tumor microenvironment and review the approved ADCs in clinical oncology, providing discussion regarding their toxicity profile, clinical manifestations and use in novel combination therapies. Finally, we briefly review ADCs in other pathological contexts and provide key information regarding ADC manufacturing and analytical characterization.",

Depending on the release mechanisms of the payloads, linkers can be broadly classified into two classes: cleavable and noncleavable.

                    "text": "As described above, the linker serves as a spacer to connect the mAb to the payload, a cytotoxic drug that must be released in the tumor site to properly exert its pharmacological effects. To be suitable as payloads in ADCs, chemicals shall ideally have low molecular weight and immunogenicity, high stability in the blood circulation and endosomal/lysosomal pathways, and high cytotoxicity (Peters and Brown, 2015;Khongorzul et al., 2020;Baah et al., 2021;Mckertish and Kayser, 2021). Because intravenous administration has shown that only a very small fraction of ADC reaches the tumor (0.1%-2%) (Chari, 2008;Hughes, 2010;Beck et al., 2017), their payloads must be 100-to 1000-fold more effective than the drugs used in chemotherapeutics as free small molecules (Baah et al., 2021). Given that the goal of the ADC strategy is to achieve potent cytotoxic activity, an important attribute to consider in the design process of these compounds is the Drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR), a value that indicates the average number of chemical molecules conjugated to the mAb. For current conjugation methods based on lysine side-chain amidation or mainly on the reduction of cysteine intermediate-chain disulfide bonds, the common DAR values range from 0 (lowest value) to 8 (highest value) (Dan et al., 2018;Wagh et al., 2018;Sun Kang et al., 2021). Nevertheless, in vivo experiments have demonstrated that a high DAR value negatively correlates with Ab pharmacokinetics. Although a low DAR implies the loading of poor number of drug molecules and consequently lower therapeutic efficacy, it is worth noting that an average DAR of 2 to 4 results in an ADC with greater anti-cancer activity/efficacy compared to an ADC with higher DAR, likely because the latter is more rapidly cleared from the body when compared to the corresponding average-conjugated counterparts (Hamblett et al., 2004;Strop et al., 2015).",

Dal Bo, P. Macor, G. Toffoli\n## Abstract\nAntibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs) represent an innovative class of potent anti-cancer compounds that are widely used in the treatment of hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. Unlike conventional chemotherapeutic drug-based therapies, that are mainly associated with modest specificity and therapeutic benefit, the three key components that form an ADC (a monoclonal antibody bound to a cytotoxic drug via a chemical linker moiety) achieve remarkable improvement in terms of targeted killing of cancer cells and, while sparing healthy tissues, a reduction in systemic side effects caused by off-tumor toxicity. Based on their beneficial mechanism of action, 15 ADCs have been approved to date by the market approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and/or other international governmental agencies for use in clinical oncology, and hundreds are undergoing evaluation in the preclinical and clinical phases. Here, our aim is to provide a comprehensive overview of the key features revolving around ADC therapeutic strategy including their structural and targeting properties, mechanism of action, the role of the tumor microenvironment and review the approved ADCs in clinical oncology, providing discussion regarding their toxicity profile, clinical manifestations and use in novel combination therapies. Finally, we briefly review ADCs in other pathological contexts and provide key information regarding ADC manufacturing and analytical characterization.\n## Linkers are sequences that connect antibodies to payloads by a chemical bond\nIn the development of the ADC strategy, linkers represent the technology that ensures a bridge between the mAb and the cytotoxic payload. They are the most modifiable part of an ADC and influence its biophysical and functional properties such as stability, potency, efficacy, and toxicity. The two main purposes of linkers are to prevent the premature release of the cytotoxic drug in the blood circulation and to ensure its efficient release at the target site (Lu et al., 2016;Bargh et al., 2019). Depending on the release mechanisms of the payloads, linkers can be broadly classified into two classes: cleavable and noncleavable. Recent advances in linker chemistry, including formulations not currently used in clinical ADCs, such as biorthogonal, photo-responsive and Fe(II)-cleavable linkers, are discussed in Su et al., 2021.\n\n## Payloads consist of potent cytotoxic agents against tumor cells\nAs described above, the linker serves as a spacer to connect the mAb to the payload, a cytotoxic drug that must be released in the tumor site to properly exert its pharmacological effects. To be suitable as payloads in ADCs, chemicals shall ideally have low molecular weight and immunogenicity, high stability in the blood circulation and endosomal/lysosomal pathways, and high cytotoxicity (Peters and Brown, 2015;Khongorzul et al., 2020;Baah et al., 2021;Mckertish and Kayser, 2021). Because intravenous administration has shown that only a very small fraction of ADC reaches the tumor (0.1%-2%) (Chari, 2008;Hughes, 2010;Beck et al., 2017), their payloads must be 100-to 1000-fold more effective than the drugs used in chemotherapeutics as free small molecules (Baah et al., 2021). Given that the goal of the ADC strategy is to achieve potent cytotoxic activity, an important attribute to consider in the design process of these compounds is the Drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR), a value that indicates the average number of chemical molecules conjugated to the mAb. For current conjugation methods based on lysine side-chain amidation or mainly on the reduction of cysteine intermediate-chain disulfide bonds, the common DAR values range from 0 (lowest value) to 8 (highest value) (Dan et al., 2018;Wagh et al., 2018;Sun Kang et al., 2021). Nevertheless, in vivo experiments have demonstrated that a high DAR value negatively correlates with Ab pharmacokinetics. Although a low DAR implies the loading of poor number of drug molecules and consequently lower therapeutic efficacy, it is worth noting that an average DAR of 2 to 4 results in an ADC with greater anti-cancer activity/efficacy compared to an ADC with higher DAR, likely because the latter is more rapidly cleared from the body when compared to the corresponding average-conjugated counterparts (Hamblett et al., 2004;Strop et al., 2015).",

This combination enables targeted delivery of cytotoxic agents to tumor site through recognizing target antigens by antibody while minimizing off-target effects on healthy tissues. Clinically, ADCs overcome the limitations of traditional chemotherapy, which lacks target specificity, and enhance the therapeutic efficacy of monoclonal antibodies, providing higher efficacy and fewer toxicity anti-tumor biopharmaceuticals. ADCs have ushered in a new era of targeted cancer therapy, with 15 drugs currently approved for clinical use. Additionally, ADCs are being investigated as potential therapeutic candidates for autoimmune diseases, persistent bacterial infections, and other challenging indications. Despite their therapeutic benefits, the development and application of ADCs face significant challenges, including antibody immunogenicity, linker instability, and inadequate control over the release of cytotoxic agent. How can ADCs be designed to be safer and more efficient? What is the future development direction of ADCs? This review provides a comprehensive overview of ADCs, summarizing the structural and functional characteristics of the three core components, antibody, linker, and payload. Furthermore, we systematically assess the advancements and challenges associated with the 15 approved ADCs in cancer therapy, while also exploring the future directions and ongoing challenges. We hope that this work will provide valuable insights into the design and optimization of next-generation ADCs for wider clinical applications.",

Its design is essential for achieving targeted delivery and maximizing therapeutic efficacy. An ideal linker should remain stable in systemic circulation to ensure that ADCs maintain a stable connection between the antibody and payload during systemic circulation, thereby minimizing premature drug release and reducing off-target toxicity. Upon entry into tumor cells, the linker should facilitate efficient and timely release of the payload, ensuring that cytotoxic effects are confined to the tumor microenvironment. Linkers with appropriate hydrophilic/lipophilic properties can bind to the characteristics of effective payloads and mitigate immune responses. Hydrophobic linkers coupled with hydrophobic payloads often promote the aggregation of ADC molecules. Aggregated ADCs may act as immunogenic substances, potentially triggering undesired immune responses during circulation in the bloodstream [119]. Additionally, the linker must not induce ADC aggregation, as this could impair antibody functionality, decrease stability, and affect pharmacokinetics [120]. Linkers are generally categorized into two main types: cleavable and non-cleavable linkers (Fig. 5).",

This combination enables targeted delivery of cytotoxic agents to tumor site through recognizing target antigens by antibody while minimizing off-target effects on healthy tissues. Clinically, ADCs overcome the limitations of traditional chemotherapy, which lacks target specificity, and enhance the therapeutic efficacy of monoclonal antibodies, providing higher efficacy and fewer toxicity anti-tumor biopharmaceuticals. ADCs have ushered in a new era of targeted cancer therapy, with 15 drugs currently approved for clinical use. Additionally, ADCs are being investigated as potential therapeutic candidates for autoimmune diseases, persistent bacterial infections, and other challenging indications. Despite their therapeutic benefits, the development and application of ADCs face significant challenges, including antibody immunogenicity, linker instability, and inadequate control over the release of cytotoxic agent. How can ADCs be designed to be safer and more efficient? What is the future development direction of ADCs? This review provides a comprehensive overview of ADCs, summarizing the structural and functional characteristics of the three core components, antibody, linker, and payload. Furthermore, we systematically assess the advancements and challenges associated with the 15 approved ADCs in cancer therapy, while also exploring the future directions and ongoing challenges. We hope that this work will provide valuable insights into the design and optimization of next-generation ADCs for wider clinical applications.\n## \"Bridges for ADCs\"-linkers\nThe linker, a crucial component of ADCs, precisely conjugates cytotoxic agents to mAbs. Its design is essential for achieving targeted delivery and maximizing therapeutic efficacy. An ideal linker should remain stable in systemic circulation to ensure that ADCs maintain a stable connection between the antibody and payload during systemic circulation, thereby minimizing premature drug release and reducing off-target toxicity. Upon entry into tumor cells, the linker should facilitate efficient and timely release of the payload, ensuring that cytotoxic effects are confined to the tumor microenvironment. Linkers with appropriate hydrophilic/lipophilic properties can bind to the characteristics of effective payloads and mitigate immune responses. Hydrophobic linkers coupled with hydrophobic payloads often promote the aggregation of ADC molecules. Aggregated ADCs may act as immunogenic substances, potentially triggering undesired immune responses during circulation in the bloodstream [119]. Additionally, the linker must not induce ADC aggregation, as this could impair antibody functionality, decrease stability, and affect pharmacokinetics [120]. Linkers are generally categorized into two main types: cleavable and non-cleavable linkers (Fig. 5).",

                    "text": "ADCs undergo biotransformation in the systemic circulation and in tissue cells. Linker deconjugation/cleavage, linker immolation and payload metabolism are considered typical major biotransformation pathways (Supplementary Figure S1) besides antibody metabolism and catabolism. From the administration of ADCs into the circulation to the action of released payloads in target cells, diverse catabolites can be generated through biotransformation, ranging from large molecules to small molecules, that are either pharmacologically active or inactive. Ideally, ADCs are desired to stay stable or intact in the circulation prior to entering target cells whereas there are situations where ADC catabolites are still biologically active (Su et al., 2018;Poreba, 2020). In most cases, the metabolic stability reflects the intact ADC level given the similar antibody PK parameters such as clearance, distribution volume and half-life mostly across different linker-drug variants. Therefore, ADC stability is herein primarily refers to the metabolic stability or integrity. A number of approaches involving conjugation site selection and linker modification have been developed to enhance ADC stability (Pillow et al., 2017;Sadowsky et al., 2017;Anami et al., 2018;Su et al., 2018). Generally, modifications can be performed on each component (e.g., antibody, linker, and payload) for such purpose. Our investigation has revealed that conjugation site, linker length, and linker steric hindrance are effective general approaches for site-specific THIOMAB TM ADCs (TDCs) (Figure 1A) and should be more broadly applicable to a variety of ADC platforms (Su et al., 2018). The desired steric shield provided by the antibody can be achieved by selecting a more sterically hindered conjugation or attachment site. On the other hand, an alternative chemical modification to introduce proximal steric hindrance around the cleavable or labile site of the linker has been demonstrated to be an effective method of improving stability (Erickson et al., 2006;Pillow et al., 2017;Sadowsky et al., 2017;Anami et al., 2018) and references therein.",

We also propose to conduct dose fractionation studies to gain guidance for optimal dosing regimens of ADCs in pre-clinical models.\n## MODULATING ANTIBODY-DRUG CONJUGATE STABILITY VIA CONJUGATION SITE, LINKER LENGTH, AND LINKER STERIC HINDRANCE\nADCs undergo biotransformation in the systemic circulation and in tissue cells. Linker deconjugation/cleavage, linker immolation and payload metabolism are considered typical major biotransformation pathways (Supplementary Figure S1) besides antibody metabolism and catabolism. From the administration of ADCs into the circulation to the action of released payloads in target cells, diverse catabolites can be generated through biotransformation, ranging from large molecules to small molecules, that are either pharmacologically active or inactive. Ideally, ADCs are desired to stay stable or intact in the circulation prior to entering target cells whereas there are situations where ADC catabolites are still biologically active (Su et al., 2018;Poreba, 2020). In most cases, the metabolic stability reflects the intact ADC level given the similar antibody PK parameters such as clearance, distribution volume and half-life mostly across different linker-drug variants. Therefore, ADC stability is herein primarily refers to the metabolic stability or integrity. A number of approaches involving conjugation site selection and linker modification have been developed to enhance ADC stability (Pillow et al., 2017;Sadowsky et al., 2017;Anami et al., 2018;Su et al., 2018). Generally, modifications can be performed on each component (e.g., antibody, linker, and payload) for such purpose. Our investigation has revealed that conjugation site, linker length, and linker steric hindrance are effective general approaches for site-specific THIOMAB TM ADCs (TDCs) (Figure 1A) and should be more broadly applicable to a variety of ADC platforms (Su et al., 2018). The desired steric shield provided by the antibody can be achieved by selecting a more sterically hindered conjugation or attachment site. On the other hand, an alternative chemical modification to introduce proximal steric hindrance around the cleavable or labile site of the linker has been demonstrated to be an effective method of improving stability (Erickson et al., 2006;Pillow et al., 2017;Sadowsky et al., 2017;Anami et al., 2018) and references therein.\n...\nDisulfide-based antibody connections have recently been developed as a new strategy for the generation of cleavable linkers (Pillow et al., 2017;Sadowsky et al., 2017). For both maleimide and disulfide cleavable linkers, the steric hindrance created by the proximity of the cleavage site is critical and can be introduced by chemical modifications to modulate stability of the conjugate. \n\nTogether, conjugation site, linker length, linkage/conjugation chemistry, cleavable/non-cleavable linkage and steric hindrance are the key parameters for consideration to optimize ADC stability. Undesired payload metabolism/release in circulation could lead to reduced efficacy and/or increased toxicity.",

Since it maintains the https://doi.org/10.4143/crt.2024.714 pISSN 1598-2998, eISSN 2005-9256 Antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) are a novel class of therapeutics that structurally are composed by an antibody directed to a tumor epitope connected via a linker to a cytotoxic payload, and that have shown significant antitumor activity across a range of malignancies including lung cancer. In this article we review the pharmacology and design of ADCs, as well as we describe the results of different studies evaluating ADCs in lung cancer directed to several targets including HER2, HER3, TROP2, MET, CEACAM5 and DLL3. \n\nADCs stability within the bloodstream, in plays a double role in both the toxicity and the activity profile of ADCs. Linker instability in this setting can lead to inappropriate or premature release of the cytotoxic payload and, in consequence, considerable toxicity. Conversely, an effective linker must also successfully release the cytotoxic payload once the ADC is internalized by the targeted cell; instead, the clinical activity of the ADC can be rather diminished [10]. \n\nLinkers are categorized into cleavable or non-cleavable according to their mechanism of payload release [11]: cleavable linkers degrade and release the cytotoxic payload on the basis of certain intracellular factors, such as acidity, glutathione reduction or the presence of lysosomal proteases leading to peptide cleavage [12,13]; on the other side, noncleavable linkers are formed by non-reducible bonds with the antibody amino-acid residues, leading to higher stability within the systemic circulation, and they release the payload through lysosomal-dependent degradation of the entire antibody-linker complex [14].",

Non-cleavable linkers are made up of stable bonds e.g., non-reducible thioether linkage (SMCC), maleimidocaproyl linkage etc. that can withstand the proteolytic degradation inside the cytosol and release of cytotoxic payloads only occurs after antigen-specific internalization of the conjugate and full breakdown of mAb by lysosomal proteolytic degradation (12,14,20). Thus, the resultant release of the cytotoxic drugs is linked to the antibody's linker and an amino acid residue, which specifically kills tumor cells and doesn't release at non-target locations to cause any damage to healthy cells. Additionally, the non-cleavable linkers have provision to modify the chemical characteristics of small molecules to enhance the affinity of the transporter and increase its effectiveness. Although they have lesser membrane permeability, these linkers are more stable than cleavable ones and increase the therapeutic window by minimizing the off-target toxicities.

ADCs are multi-functional biologics in which a disease-targeting antibody is conjugated to an effector payload molecule via a linker. The success of currently used ADCs has been largely attributed to the development of linker systems, which allow for the targeted release of cytocidal payload drugs inside cancer cells. Many lysosomal proteases are over expressed in human cancers. They can effectively cleave a variety of peptide sequences, which can be exploited for the design of ADC linker systems. As a well-established linker, valine-citrulline-p-aminobenzyl carbamate (ValCitPABC) is used in many ADCs that are already approved or under preclinical and clinical development. Although ValCitPABC and related linkers are readily cleaved by cathepsins in the lysosome while remaining reasonably stable in human plasma, many studies have shown that they are susceptible to carboxylesterase 1C (Ces1C) in mouse and rat plasma, which hinders the preclinical evaluation of ADCs. Furthermore, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, two of the most commonly observed dose-limiting adverse effects of ADCs, are believed to result from the premature hydrolysis of ValCitPABC by human neutrophil elastase. In addition to ValCitPABC, the GGFG tetrapeptidyl-aminomethoxy linker is also cathepsin-cleavable and is used in the highly successful ADC drug, DS8201a. In addition to cathepsin-cleavable linkers, there is also growing interest in legumain-sensitive linkers for ADC development. Increasing plasma stability while maintaining lysosomal cleavability of ADC linkers is an objective of intensive current research. This review reports recent advances in the design and structure\u2013activity relationship studies of various peptide/peptidomimetic linkers in this field.",

In another study [54], Kaempffe et al. generated three trastuzumab-derived ADCs using the Val-Cit-PABC linker via mTG conjugation at native Q295 and two engineered glutamine sites at the C-terminus of heavy or light chains. They found that, in huFcRn transgenic mice, the Q295-or light chain C-terminal-conjugated ADC displayed a superior PK property, whereas the heavy chain C-terminal-conjugated ADC showed faster clearance. Therefore, whilst linker design is an important consideration, a holistic approach is to also take into account, among other things, the site of the conjugation in ADC development. As seen from the studies discussed here, a carefully chosen conjugation site can provide a favorable local environment to protect the conjugate and the linker against chemical and/or enzymatic attacks during systemic circulation.",

Balamkundu, Chuan-Fa Liu\n## Abstract\nAntibody\u2013drug Conjugates (ADCs) are a powerful therapeutic modality for cancer treatment. ADCs are multi-functional biologics in which a disease-targeting antibody is conjugated to an effector payload molecule via a linker. The success of currently used ADCs has been largely attributed to the development of linker systems, which allow for the targeted release of cytocidal payload drugs inside cancer cells. Many lysosomal proteases are over expressed in human cancers. They can effectively cleave a variety of peptide sequences, which can be exploited for the design of ADC linker systems. As a well-established linker, valine-citrulline-p-aminobenzyl carbamate (ValCitPABC) is used in many ADCs that are already approved or under preclinical and clinical development. Although ValCitPABC and related linkers are readily cleaved by cathepsins in the lysosome while remaining reasonably stable in human plasma, many studies have shown that they are susceptible to carboxylesterase 1C (Ces1C) in mouse and rat plasma, which hinders the preclinical evaluation of ADCs. Furthermore, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, two of the most commonly observed dose-limiting adverse effects of ADCs, are believed to result from the premature hydrolysis of ValCitPABC by human neutrophil elastase. In addition to ValCitPABC, the GGFG tetrapeptidyl-aminomethoxy linker is also cathepsin-cleavable and is used in the highly successful ADC drug, DS8201a. In addition to cathepsin-cleavable linkers, there is also growing interest in legumain-sensitive linkers for ADC development. Increasing plasma stability while maintaining lysosomal cleavability of ADC linkers is an objective of intensive current research. This review reports recent advances in the design and structure\u2013activity relationship studies of various peptide/peptidomimetic linkers in this field.\n## Site of Conjugation on ADC Stability and Activity\nIn addition to the linker, the conjugation site can also have a significant influence on the stability of an ADC during circulation, and hence, its overall pharmacological activity. The availability of many different site-specific conjugation methods [51] has made it possible to choose suitable sites on the antibody for payload attachment. The thiol-maleimide Michael addition chemistry is a commonly used method because of its robustness and chemospecificity. The reaction leads to a succinimide thioether linkage formed with either native or engineered cysteine residues in the antibody. However, the maleimide exchange with thiols present in certain plasma components can result in deconjugation, which negatively affects ADC efficacy and safety. The succinimide ring can also undergo hydrolysis to produce a stable linkage which cannot further undergo retro-Michael elimination and is therefore beneficial for ADC activity. Shen et al. have shown that the different solvent accessibility and chemical environment of different conjugation sites can have different effects on the above-mentioned two reactions, which in turn affects the stability and efficacy of the corresponding ADCs [52]. It is interesting to note that conjugation site-dependent payload loss in plasma was observed not only with the ValCit-PABC linkers, but also with the non-cleavable linkers. The results from this study seem to show that the decrease in DAR was due to chemical deconjugation; however, one may not completely exclude the possibility that the enzymatic cleavage of the ValCit-PABC linker also played a role, though likely to a much lesser extent. Bioconjugation using microbial transglutaminase (mTG) has been used to assess how the stability of the antibody-drug linker is influenced by the site of the conjugation. In a study conducted by Dorywalska et al., it is shown that the conjugation site critically affects the enzymatic susceptibility of the ValCit-PABC linker to unidentified serine proteases in mouse plasma (likely Ces1C), of which there is a positive correlation between linker stability and ADC cytotoxic potency both in vitro and in vivo [53].\n...\nIn a study conducted by Dorywalska et al., it is shown that the conjugation site critically affects the enzymatic susceptibility of the ValCit-PABC linker to unidentified serine proteases in mouse plasma (likely Ces1C), of which there is a positive correlation between linker stability and ADC cytotoxic potency both in vitro and in vivo [53]. In another study [54], Kaempffe et al. generated three trastuzumab-derived ADCs using the Val-Cit-PABC linker via mTG conjugation at native Q295 and two engineered glutamine sites at the C-terminus of heavy or light chains. They found that, in huFcRn transgenic mice, the Q295-or light chain C-terminal-conjugated ADC displayed a superior PK property, whereas the heavy chain C-terminal-conjugated ADC showed faster clearance. Therefore, whilst linker design is an important consideration, a holistic approach is to also take into account, among other things, the site of the conjugation in ADC development. As seen from the studies discussed here, a carefully chosen conjugation site can provide a favorable local environment to protect the conjugate and the linker against chemical and/or enzymatic attacks during systemic circulation.",

            "abstract": "The list of ADCs in the clinic continues to grow, bolstered by the success of first two marketed ADCs: ADCETRIS\u00ae and Kadcyla\u00ae. Currently, there are 40 ADCs in various phases of clinical development. However, only 34 of these have published their structures. Of the 34 disclosed structures, 24 of them use a linkage to the thiol of cysteines on the monoclonal antibody. The remaining 10 candidates utilize chemistry to surface lysines of the antibody. Due to the inherent heterogeneity of conjugation to the multiple lysines or cysteines found in mAbs, significant research efforts are now being directed toward the production of discrete, homogeneous ADC products, via site-specific conjugation. These site-specific conjugations may involve genetic engineering of the mAb to introduce discrete, available cysteines or non-natural amino acids with an orthogonally-reactive functional group handle such as an aldehyde, ketone, azido, or alkynyl tag. These site-specific approaches not only increase the homogeneity of ADCs but also enable novel bio-orthogonal chemistries that utilize reactive moieties other than thiol or amine. This broadens the diversity of linkers that can be utilized which will lead to better linker design in future generations of ADCs.",

This stability prevents the premature release of the cytotoxic payload, which would indiscriminately damage tissue of all kinds, thereby lowering the therapeutic index of the ADC. Upon internalization, the ADC should liberate the payload such that the payload can bind to its target. In addition to these two basic functions, linkers can have a profound effect on the physico-chemical properties of the ADC. In particular, most of the cytotoxic payloads are hydrophobic in nature. Thus, linking them to the mAb with an additional hydrophobic moiety can create problems due to aggregation. ADC Current ADC Linker Chemistry aggregates are insoluble and often limit achievable drug loading onto the antibody. It has been conjectured that ADC aggregates are sequestered in the liver, leading to hepatotoxicity (8). Lastly, protein aggregation of biologics, in general, has been linked to increased immunogenicity (9). Due to these safety concerns, aggregation needs to be monitored over time in ADC products to establish a safe shelf-life. In addition to aggregation problems, the hydrophobic characteristic of the majority of cytotoxic compounds in ADCs causes them to be good substrates for multidrug resistance (MDR) transporters. These transporters are responsible for effluxing cytotoxins out of the tumor cells, thus compromising efficacy. However, Kovtun et al. has shown that using a hydrophilic linker with maytansinoids produced a hydrophilic metabolite of DM1 which was not an MDR substrate (10). This hydrophilic-linked DM1 ADC was markedly more effective in an MDR-1-expressing human xenograft tumor than the MCC-DM1 ADC.",

Tomczuk\n## Abstract\nThe list of ADCs in the clinic continues to grow, bolstered by the success of first two marketed ADCs: ADCETRIS\u00ae and Kadcyla\u00ae. Currently, there are 40 ADCs in various phases of clinical development. However, only 34 of these have published their structures. Of the 34 disclosed structures, 24 of them use a linkage to the thiol of cysteines on the monoclonal antibody. The remaining 10 candidates utilize chemistry to surface lysines of the antibody. Due to the inherent heterogeneity of conjugation to the multiple lysines or cysteines found in mAbs, significant research efforts are now being directed toward the production of discrete, homogeneous ADC products, via site-specific conjugation. These site-specific conjugations may involve genetic engineering of the mAb to introduce discrete, available cysteines or non-natural amino acids with an orthogonally-reactive functional group handle such as an aldehyde, ketone, azido, or alkynyl tag. These site-specific approaches not only increase the homogeneity of ADCs but also enable novel bio-orthogonal chemistries that utilize reactive moieties other than thiol or amine. This broadens the diversity of linkers that can be utilized which will lead to better linker design in future generations of ADCs.\n## THE LINKER\nThe linker, which is the highlight of this review, needs to possess a number of key attributes, including the requirement to be stable in plasma after drug administration for an extended period of time such that the ADC can localize to tumor cells. This stability prevents the premature release of the cytotoxic payload, which would indiscriminately damage tissue of all kinds, thereby lowering the therapeutic index of the ADC. Upon internalization, the ADC should liberate the payload such that the payload can bind to its target. In addition to these two basic functions, linkers can have a profound effect on the physico-chemical properties of the ADC. In particular, most of the cytotoxic payloads are hydrophobic in nature. Thus, linking them to the mAb with an additional hydrophobic moiety can create problems due to aggregation. ADC Current ADC Linker Chemistry aggregates are insoluble and often limit achievable drug loading onto the antibody. It has been conjectured that ADC aggregates are sequestered in the liver, leading to hepatotoxicity (8). Lastly, protein aggregation of biologics, in general, has been linked to increased immunogenicity (9). Due to these safety concerns, aggregation needs to be monitored over time in ADC products to establish a safe shelf-life. In addition to aggregation problems, the hydrophobic characteristic of the majority of cytotoxic compounds in ADCs causes them to be good substrates for multidrug resistance (MDR) transporters. These transporters are responsible for effluxing cytotoxins out of the tumor cells, thus compromising efficacy. However, Kovtun et al. has shown that using a hydrophilic linker with maytansinoids produced a hydrophilic metabolite of DM1 which was not an MDR substrate (10). This hydrophilic-linked DM1 ADC was markedly more effective in an MDR-1-expressing human xenograft tumor than the MCC-DM1 ADC.",

A(P)DCs have three major components, antibody (targeting protein), linker and payload, the cytotoxic drug. Recently, advances in identifying targets, selecting highly specific mAbs of preferred isotypes, optimizing linker technology and improving chemical methods for conjugation have led to the approval of two ADCs by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and more than 30 ADCs in advanced clinical development.

Stability of ADCs before they reach target cells is the key to minimize off-target killing and maximize tumor exposure to drugs. Upon internalization of ADCs into cells, linkers should be labile enough to ensure rapid release of drugs into cytoplasm where they bind to tubulins or DNA molecules. Design of linker/spacer is intricately related to how ADC will exert its cytotoxicity intracellularly. The choice of linker determines the release mechanism of drugs that is often limited by chemistry and biology of cancer cells. \n\nHeterobifunctional linkers are commonly used in ADCs [49], because they allow attachment of drugs through disulfide bond and amide bond. A typical example of linker, such as 4-(-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexanecarboxylic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (SMCC) has N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester, which reacts with primary amines to form amide bond, and maleimide group that reacts with sulfhydryl group to form stable thioether bond. Linkers such as N-succinimidyl 4-(2-pyridyldithio)pentanoate (SPP) and N-succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldithiol)butyrate (SPDB) allow amide bond on one end and disulfide bond on the other end, which may be cleaved in reductive environment of some cancer cells. Besides, since maytansinoids and MMAE are synthetic analogs of their natural product counterparts, sulfhydryl or amine groups can be added during synthesis, making them adaptable to various conjugation chemistry methods. Therefore, the main conjugation sites on antibodies are cysteines (both native and mutated cysteines) and lysines.",

Prabakaran, Kedan Lin, D. Dimitrov\n## Abstract\nConjugates of small molecule drugs with antibodies (ADCs) and with other proteins (protein-drug conjugates, PDC) are used as a new class of targeted therapeutics combining the specificity of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and other proteins with potent cytotoxic activity of small molecule drugs for the treatment of cancer and other diseases. A(P)DCs have three major components, antibody (targeting protein), linker and payload, the cytotoxic drug. Recently, advances in identifying targets, selecting highly specific mAbs of preferred isotypes, optimizing linker technology and improving chemical methods for conjugation have led to the approval of two ADCs by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and more than 30 ADCs in advanced clinical development. However, the complex and heterogeneous nature of A(P)DCs often cause poor solubility, instability, aggregation and eventually unwanted toxicity. This article reviews the main components of A(P)DCs, and discusses the choices for drugs, linkers and conjugation methods currently used. Future work will need to focus on developments and strategies for overcoming such major problems associated with the A(P)DCs.\n## Linkers and Conjugation Chemistry\nThe potent cytotoxic drugs are covalently attached to antibodies through linkers, and the linker stability is critical to the efficacy of ADCs. Stability of ADCs before they reach target cells is the key to minimize off-target killing and maximize tumor exposure to drugs. Upon internalization of ADCs into cells, linkers should be labile enough to ensure rapid release of drugs into cytoplasm where they bind to tubulins or DNA molecules. Design of linker/spacer is intricately related to how ADC will exert its cytotoxicity intracellularly. The choice of linker determines the release mechanism of drugs that is often limited by chemistry and biology of cancer cells. \n\nHeterobifunctional linkers are commonly used in ADCs [49], because they allow attachment of drugs through disulfide bond and amide bond. A typical example of linker, such as 4-(-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexanecarboxylic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (SMCC) has N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester, which reacts with primary amines to form amide bond, and maleimide group that reacts with sulfhydryl group to form stable thioether bond. Linkers such as N-succinimidyl 4-(2-pyridyldithio)pentanoate (SPP) and N-succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldithiol)butyrate (SPDB) allow amide bond on one end and disulfide bond on the other end, which may be cleaved in reductive environment of some cancer cells. Besides, since maytansinoids and MMAE are synthetic analogs of their natural product counterparts, sulfhydryl or amine groups can be added during synthesis, making them adaptable to various conjugation chemistry methods. Therefore, the main conjugation sites on antibodies are cysteines (both native and mutated cysteines) and lysines.",

The high stability of the transglutaminase-generated antibody-drug amide linkage [17,21] provided us with a unique opportunity to investigate metabolic processes that may be acting upon conjugates with purportedly more stable non-cleavable linker-payloads. Initially, we generated a series of conjugates using the Amino-PEG6-Propionyl-MMAD payload (PEG6-C2-MMAD), a potent analogue of the antimitotic agent Dolastatin 10 [22], attached to specific sites across the anti-M1S1 C16 antibody (Fig 1a and 1b). To evaluate linker-payload stability, we performed comparative in vitro plasma stability assays by incubating conjugates in mouse plasma, purifying them and comparing their drug-antibody ratio (DAR) to that of untreated conjugates. Unlike the cleavable Aminocaproyl-valine-citrulline-p-aminobenzylcarbamate (C6-VC-PABC) linker [21], the non-cleavable PEG6-C2-MMAD-derived conjugates remained stable across most of the sites tested over a 4.5 day incubation period in mouse plasma, with both the transglutaminase linkage and the Amino-PEG6 linker intact. However, we discovered a position-dependent degradation of the C terminus of MMAD (Fig 1b, Table 1), initially observed by hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) as a decrease in retention time of the ADC following plasma exposure. We subsequently identified the degradation by mass spectrometry as a loss of 186 Da, which is consistent with the hydrolytic cleavage of the C-terminal dolaphenine residue of MMAD (Fig 2a  In contrast to the cleavage observed in mouse plasma, the degradation of the MMAD C terminus was minimal to undetectable in rat, cynomolgus monkey, and human plasma in vitro under the conditions studied (Fig 3).",

An appropriate linker between the antibody and the cytotoxic drug provides a specific bridge, and thus helps the antibody to selectively deliver the cytotoxic drug to tumor cells and accurately releases the cytotoxic drug at tumor sites. In addition to conjugation, the linkers maintain ADCs\u2019 stability during the preparation and storage stages of the ADCs and during the systemic circulation period. The design of linkers for ADCs is a challenge in terms of extracellular stability and intracellular release, and intracellular circumstances, such as the acid environment, the reducing environment and cathepsin, are considered as the catalysts to activate the triggers for initiating the cleavage of ADCs. This review discusses the linkers used in the clinical and marketing stages for ADCs and details the fracture modes of the linkers for the further development of ADCs.",

Significant efforts have been made in designing and choosing suitable linkers for conjugating monoclonal antibodies and cytotoxic drugs. Those linkers can influence the stability, toxicity, PK properties, and pharmacodynamics of ADCs. Each linker has its advantages and disadvantages, and many factors must be considered when they are selected and applied for determinate monoclonal antibodies and specific cytotoxic drugs. The appropriate linker must consider the existing groups presented in the monoclonal antibody, the reactive groups in the cytotoxic drugs, as well as the derivative functional groups. The perfect linker can guarantee sufficient stability of cytotoxic drugs during circulation in the blood stream, effectively prevent premature drug release, efficiently facilitate the liberation of the cytotoxic drug at the target tumor cells, and vigorously promote the efficacy and tolerability of successful ADCs.",

                    "text": "Considerable efforts are being invested to construct the appropriate linkers, which must meet requirements for maintaining the properties of monoclonal antibodies and the cell killing activity of cytotoxic drugs, reducing systemic toxicity, maintaining the stability of ADCs and releasing in the right circumstances [4,5,36]. Among these properties, linkers should possess two crucial characteristics, including stability in plasma for an extended period of time so that the ADCs can reach and localize to the cancer cell in the original formation. After internalization, the linkers play a role as a trigger for releasing the cytotoxic drugs when the ADCs face particular circumstances in the cancer cells, and the released cytotoxic drugs could bind to their targets [37]. With the particular microenvironment of tumor cells and the delivery mechanism selected, the active formation of the cytotoxic drug may be efficiently released from ADCs by fracturing the designed linkers inside the target cells [38]. The stability and rupturing capacity of linkers affect the overall pharmacokinetics (PK) properties, toxicities and therapeutic indexes of ADCs [39]. The earlier ADCs, such as BR96-DOX and Mylotarg@, did not have a sufficient therapeutic index and had been withdrawn from the market, which was attributed to the poor stability of linkers [4,40]. Antibodies that selectively bind to the tumor cells and show little cross-reactivity with healthy tissues can be conjugated to the specific cytotoxic drugs through different linkers [30,31]. Antibodies with a preferential role in ADCs must have the following characteristics: special targeting ability to deliver cytotoxic drugs to the tumor cells, high affinity binding to tumor cell-surface antigens and the ability to induce the cells' endocytosis, low immunogenicity and the appropriate linkage sites which would not impact the affinity, endocytosis or efficacy of cytotoxic drugs [32]. However, recently, one report indicated low binding affinity to antibodies may allow for effective penetration to solid tumors [33].",

An appropriate linker between the antibody and the cytotoxic drug provides a specific bridge, and thus helps the antibody to selectively deliver the cytotoxic drug to tumor cells and accurately releases the cytotoxic drug at tumor sites. In addition to conjugation, the linkers maintain ADCs\u2019 stability during the preparation and storage stages of the ADCs and during the systemic circulation period. The design of linkers for ADCs is a challenge in terms of extracellular stability and intracellular release, and intracellular circumstances, such as the acid environment, the reducing environment and cathepsin, are considered as the catalysts to activate the triggers for initiating the cleavage of ADCs. This review discusses the linkers used in the clinical and marketing stages for ADCs and details the fracture modes of the linkers for the further development of ADCs.\n## Introduction\nConsiderable efforts are being invested to construct the appropriate linkers, which must meet requirements for maintaining the properties of monoclonal antibodies and the cell killing activity of cytotoxic drugs, reducing systemic toxicity, maintaining the stability of ADCs and releasing in the right circumstances [4,5,36]. Among these properties, linkers should possess two crucial characteristics, including stability in plasma for an extended period of time so that the ADCs can reach and localize to the cancer cell in the original formation. After internalization, the linkers play a role as a trigger for releasing the cytotoxic drugs when the ADCs face particular circumstances in the cancer cells, and the released cytotoxic drugs could bind to their targets [37]. With the particular microenvironment of tumor cells and the delivery mechanism selected, the active formation of the cytotoxic drug may be efficiently released from ADCs by fracturing the designed linkers inside the target cells [38]. The stability and rupturing capacity of linkers affect the overall pharmacokinetics (PK) properties, toxicities and therapeutic indexes of ADCs [39]. The earlier ADCs, such as BR96-DOX and Mylotarg@, did not have a sufficient therapeutic index and had been withdrawn from the market, which was attributed to the poor stability of linkers [4,40]. Antibodies that selectively bind to the tumor cells and show little cross-reactivity with healthy tissues can be conjugated to the specific cytotoxic drugs through different linkers [30,31]. Antibodies with a preferential role in ADCs must have the following characteristics: special targeting ability to deliver cytotoxic drugs to the tumor cells, high affinity binding to tumor cell-surface antigens and the ability to induce the cells' endocytosis, low immunogenicity and the appropriate linkage sites which would not impact the affinity, endocytosis or efficacy of cytotoxic drugs [32]. However, recently, one report indicated low binding affinity to antibodies may allow for effective penetration to solid tumors [33].\n\n## Conclusions\nThe non-cleavable linkers, hydrazone linkers, disulfide linkers, peptide linkers and \u03b2-glucuronide linkers are most frequently utilized in the ADCs. Significant efforts have been made in designing and choosing suitable linkers for conjugating monoclonal antibodies and cytotoxic drugs. Those linkers can influence the stability, toxicity, PK properties, and pharmacodynamics of ADCs. Each linker has its advantages and disadvantages, and many factors must be considered when they are selected and applied for determinate monoclonal antibodies and specific cytotoxic drugs. The appropriate linker must consider the existing groups presented in the monoclonal antibody, the reactive groups in the cytotoxic drugs, as well as the derivative functional groups. The perfect linker can guarantee sufficient stability of cytotoxic drugs during circulation in the blood stream, effectively prevent premature drug release, efficiently facilitate the liberation of the cytotoxic drug at the target tumor cells, and vigorously promote the efficacy and tolerability of successful ADCs.",

Scott\n## Abstract\nAntibody\u2013drug conjugates (ADCs) are novel drugs that exploit the specificity of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) to reach target antigens expressed on cancer cells for the delivery of a potent cytotoxic payload. ADCs provide a unique opportunity to deliver drugs to tumor cells while minimizing toxicity to normal tissue, achieving wider therapeutic windows and enhanced pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties. To date, nine ADCs have been approved by the FDA and more than 80 ADCs are under clinical development worldwide. In this paper, we provide an overview of the biology and chemistry of each component of ADC design. We briefly discuss the clinical experience with approved ADCs and the various pathways involved in ADC resistance. We conclude with perspectives about the future development of the next generations of ADCs, including the role of molecular imaging in drug development.\n## Linkers\nThe linkers play a significant role in antibody-drug conjugate design as they link the cytotoxic payload to the antibody.Various factors such as linker chemistry, mode and the site of conjugation play a crucial role in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of ADC.Linkers must maintain the stability of the ADC in the blood circulation to enable it to reach the cancer cell intact but must then be readily cleaved when internalized so that the payload can be released.Broadly speaking, linkers can be categorized into two groups: cleavable or non-cleavable linkers.\n\nCleavable linkers depend on physiological conditions in the cell to cleave the linker and can be further subdivided into acid sensitive, protease sensitive or glutathione sensitive.The acid-sensitive linker AcBut (4-4 -acetylphenoxy butanoic acid) is used to link anti-CD33 and anti-CD22 antibodies to calicheamicin in ADCs gemtuzumab ozogamicin and inotuzumab ozogamicin, respectively.This linker connecting the antibody to calicheamicin forms a hydrazone with the hydrazide of the calicheamicin derivative, which is hydrolysed in lysosomal pH, and calicheamicin is released, leading to cell death.However, the acid-sensitive linker has a low plasma stability of 48-72 h [56][57][58].The protease-cleavable linker, e.g., dipeptide valine-citrulline (Val-Cit, V-C), is utilized in brentuximab vedotin to link the monomethylauristatin E (MMAE) payload to the anti-CD30 antibody.Val-Cit is more stable in the plasma due to the presence of protease inhibitors than acid-based linkers, but can still be rapidly hydrolysed by lysosomal enzyme cathepsin B once internalized [55].",

Since the approval of first ADC (Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (trade name: Mylotarg)) for the treatment of CD33-positive acute myelogenous leukemia, several ADCs have been developed for the treatment of cancer. The goal of an ADC as a cancer agent is to release the cytotoxic drug to kill the tumor cells without harming the normal or healthy cells. With time, it is being realized that ADCS can also be used to manage or cure other diseases such as inflammatory diseases, atherosclerosis, and bacteremia and some research in this direction is ongoing. The focus of this review is on the clinical pharmacology aspects of ADC development.

Mahmood\n## Abstract\nAntibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are biopharmaceutical products where a monoclonal antibody is linked to a biologically active drug (a small molecule) forming a conjugate. Since the approval of first ADC (Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (trade name: Mylotarg)) for the treatment of CD33-positive acute myelogenous leukemia, several ADCs have been developed for the treatment of cancer. The goal of an ADC as a cancer agent is to release the cytotoxic drug to kill the tumor cells without harming the normal or healthy cells. With time, it is being realized that ADCS can also be used to manage or cure other diseases such as inflammatory diseases, atherosclerosis, and bacteremia and some research in this direction is ongoing. The focus of this review is on the clinical pharmacology aspects of ADC development. From the selection of an appropriate antibody to the finished product, the entire process of the development of an ADC is a difficult and challenging task. Clinical pharmacology is one of the most important tools of drug development since this tool helps in finding the optimum dose of a product, thus preserving the safety and efficacy of the product in a patient population. Unlike other small or large molecules where only one moiety and/or metabolite(s) is generally measured for the pharmacokinetic profiling, there are several moieties that need to be measured for characterizing the PK profiles of an ADC. Therefore, knowledge and understanding of clinical pharmacology of ADCs is vital for the selection of a safe and efficacious dose in a patient population.\n## Linkers\nLinkers are an integral part of ADCs. The linkers dictate the drug release mechanism, PK, therapeutic index, and safety of an ADC. The linkers provide the stability of drug antibody conjugation in the circulation. Early generation ADC linkers were chemically labile linkers such as disulfides and hydrazones [43][44][45][46][47]. These linkers were unstable in the circulation with short half-lives, generally one to two days. The recent generation of linkers are more stable in the systemic circulation such as peptide and glucuronide linkers. \n\nPeptide-based linkers comparatively provide better stability and drug release.

Modern approaches have been implemented to target and heighten the effect of cytostatic drugs on tumors and diminish their general/unspecific toxicity. In this context, antibody\u2013drug conjugates (ADCs) represent a promising and successful strategy. The aim of this review was to assess different aspects regarding ADCs. They were presented from a chemical and a pharmacological perspective and aspects like structure, conjugation and development particularities alongside effects, clinical trials, safety issues and perspectives and challenges for future use of these drugs were discussed. Representative examples include but are not limited to the following main structural components of ADCs: monoclonal antibodies (trastuzumab, brentuximab), linkers (pH-sensitive, reduction-sensitive, peptide-based, phosphate-based, and others), and payloads (doxorubicin, emtansine, ravtansine, calicheamicin). Regarding pharmacotherapy success, the high effectiveness expectation associated with ADC treatment is supported by the large number of ongoing clinical trials. Major aspects such as development strategies are first discussed, advantages and disadvantages, safety and efficacy, offering a retrospective insight on the subject. The second part of the review is prospective, focusing on various plans to overcome the previously identified difficulties.",

Vonica-\u021aincu\n## Abstract\nAntineoplastic therapy is one of the main research themes of this century. Modern approaches have been implemented to target and heighten the effect of cytostatic drugs on tumors and diminish their general/unspecific toxicity. In this context, antibody\u2013drug conjugates (ADCs) represent a promising and successful strategy. The aim of this review was to assess different aspects regarding ADCs. They were presented from a chemical and a pharmacological perspective and aspects like structure, conjugation and development particularities alongside effects, clinical trials, safety issues and perspectives and challenges for future use of these drugs were discussed. Representative examples include but are not limited to the following main structural components of ADCs: monoclonal antibodies (trastuzumab, brentuximab), linkers (pH-sensitive, reduction-sensitive, peptide-based, phosphate-based, and others), and payloads (doxorubicin, emtansine, ravtansine, calicheamicin). Regarding pharmacotherapy success, the high effectiveness expectation associated with ADC treatment is supported by the large number of ongoing clinical trials. Major aspects such as development strategies are first discussed, advantages and disadvantages, safety and efficacy, offering a retrospective insight on the subject. The second part of the review is prospective, focusing on various plans to overcome the previously identified difficulties.\n## Payloads\nPayloads are cytotoxic active molecules coupled with an mAb via a linker [55].Over time, numerous molecules such as cytokines [56], radionucleotides [57], and various toxins [57] have been suggested as payloads, but currently, most FDA/EMA-approved ADCs are conjugated with small cytotoxic molecules with a wide array of structures and Compared to cleavable linkers, the primary benefit of non-cleavable linkers is represented by improved plasma stability, potentially resulting in a wider therapeutic window.Furthermore, it is predicted to decrease off-target toxicity because inseparable ADCs have greater stability and tolerance [40,46].Numerous studies have been conducted to design and select appropriate linkers to obtain ADCs by conjugation with monoclonal antibodies and cytotoxic drugs, which are the components that can alter the stability, toxicity, pharmacokinetic properties, and pharmacodynamics of ADCs.Every linker has its benefits and shortcomings, and therefore numerous aspects must be taken into account in their choice and use.Thus, the decision to select the suitable linker considers existing groups in mAb, reactive groups in the cytotoxic medicinal product, and derived functional groups.The optimal linker ensures sufficient stability of the cytotoxic drug in the blood, efficiently inhibits early release of the drug, and efficiently facilitates the release of the cytotoxic drug into targeted tumor cells, thus enhancing the efficiency and tolerability of an ADC in its ensemble [31,53,54].",

While these immunoconjugate agents provide several advantages compared to their small-molecule counterparts, their clinical use is still in its infancy. The considerations in their development and clinical use are complex, and consist of multiple components and variables that can affect the pharmacologic characteristics. It is critical to understand the mechanisms employed by ADCs in navigating biological barriers and how these factors affect their biodistribution, delivery to tumors, efficacy, and toxicity. Thus, future studies are warranted to better understand the complex pharmacology and interaction between ADC carriers and biological systems, such as the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) and tumor microenvironment. This review provides an overview of factors that affect the pharmacologic profiles of ADC therapies that are currently in clinical use and development.",

For this type of linker to be effective, the cytotoxic agent must maintain its activity, despite still being attached to part of the linker [22]. ADCs with non-cleavable linkers are considered to have improved therapeutic index because of their greater plasma stability, although new designs of cleavable linkers have significantly improved stability [23]. \n\nIt is clear that the disposition of a mAb is dependent upon several factors (Figure 1), and not just the therapeutic entity conjugated to it, in the case of an ADC. While mAbs trigger an effector function on their own, ADCs act more like prodrugs, and may or may not exert an anti-cancer effect until the SM drug is released from the mAb carrier. Thus, the pharmacology of mAbs and ADCs are complex. As a result, analytical and PK studies must be performed to assess the disposition of not just conjugated and released forms of ADCs, but also the effects of modifications on the mAbs after administration. \n\nAntibodies 2018, 7, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 28 improve ADC solubility or reduce ADC aggregation [6,20]. Typically, linkers used in ADC formulations are classified as being either \"cleavable\" or \"non-cleavable\". Cleavable linkers respond to physiological stimuli, such as low pH or proteolytic cleavage, to release the cytotoxic drug from its ADC carrier [21]. In theory, these linkers are catalyzed in a tumor cells, due to the presence, or increased presence, of their catalyst, to allow for selective release of the cytotoxic agent [5,21]. An example of a cleavable linker is seen in brentuximab vedotin, where the monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) cytotoxic payload is released by protease activity (Adcetris, Settle Genetics, Seattle, WA, USA).",

Their results showed that agents with a high DAR (average 10, range 7-14) using both linker formats had faster distribution and clearance rates and decreased efficacy in vivo (Figure 4) [79,83]. On the other hand, ADCs with a DAR less than 6 displayed similar clearances, superior in vivo efficacy, and were well tolerated [79,83]. Hambelet et al. demonstrated similar conclusions in a study evaluating MMAE conjugated to a CD30 antibody using a MC-vc-PAB linker [78]. When DARs were manipulated to increase the cytotoxic payload with either 2, 4, or 8 drugs per antibody, the clearance increased [78]. These results may be related to the difference in the rate of uptake of these agents by the MPS and other non-target cells. \n\nAdditionally, the site of conjugation can play a role in augmenting the pharmacology of an ADC. Strop et al. created an ADC with an average DAR ~1.7, but directed conjugation using a novel enzymatic conjugation to precise points on the antibody backbone to create homogenous solutions [84]. Their study reported how the site of conjugation affected linker stability in a species-dependent manner, where conjugation on the light chain appears to be cleaved more quickly compared to heavy chain conjugation in mice, but stable in rats [84]. Additionally, heavy chain conjugation demonstrated dramatically different PK and faster rate of drug loss, compared to either light chain conjugated ADCs or naked mAbs in rats [84]. The uses of such technologies can allow for increased studies of the role of the linker, linker position, and cytotoxic payload to optimize the pharmacology and improve the therapeutic index of these agents.",

Price, Allison N. Schorzman, Mallory Storrie, J. Piscitelli, Juan Razo, W. Zamboni\n## Abstract\nMajor advances in therapeutic proteins, including antibody\u2013drug conjugates (ADCs), have created revolutionary drug delivery systems in cancer over the past decade. While these immunoconjugate agents provide several advantages compared to their small-molecule counterparts, their clinical use is still in its infancy. The considerations in their development and clinical use are complex, and consist of multiple components and variables that can affect the pharmacologic characteristics. It is critical to understand the mechanisms employed by ADCs in navigating biological barriers and how these factors affect their biodistribution, delivery to tumors, efficacy, and toxicity. Thus, future studies are warranted to better understand the complex pharmacology and interaction between ADC carriers and biological systems, such as the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) and tumor microenvironment. This review provides an overview of factors that affect the pharmacologic profiles of ADC therapies that are currently in clinical use and development.\n## Linkers\nIn the lysosomal compartment, the process of intracellular proteolytic degradation reduces the ADC to the level of amino acids. For this type of linker to be effective, the cytotoxic agent must maintain its activity, despite still being attached to part of the linker [22]. ADCs with non-cleavable linkers are considered to have improved therapeutic index because of their greater plasma stability, although new designs of cleavable linkers have significantly improved stability [23]. \n\nIt is clear that the disposition of a mAb is dependent upon several factors (Figure 1), and not just the therapeutic entity conjugated to it, in the case of an ADC. While mAbs trigger an effector function on their own, ADCs act more like prodrugs, and may or may not exert an anti-cancer effect until the SM drug is released from the mAb carrier. Thus, the pharmacology of mAbs and ADCs are complex. As a result, analytical and PK studies must be performed to assess the disposition of not just conjugated and released forms of ADCs, but also the effects of modifications on the mAbs after administration. \n\nAntibodies 2018, 7, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 28 improve ADC solubility or reduce ADC aggregation [6,20]. Typically, linkers used in ADC formulations are classified as being either \"cleavable\" or \"non-cleavable\". Cleavable linkers respond to physiological stimuli, such as low pH or proteolytic cleavage, to release the cytotoxic drug from its ADC carrier [21]. In theory, these linkers are catalyzed in a tumor cells, due to the presence, or increased presence, of their catalyst, to allow for selective release of the cytotoxic agent [5,21]. An example of a cleavable linker is seen in brentuximab vedotin, where the monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) cytotoxic payload is released by protease activity (Adcetris, Settle Genetics, Seattle, WA, USA).\n\n## Drug-Antibody Ratio (DAR)\nThe drug-antibody ratio (DAR), or number of drug molecules conjugated to a single ADC, is critical in determining efficacy. Optimal DAR to achieve the greatest clinical efficacy has yet to be determined, and may be highly dependent on other ADC variables. In addition, DAR varies within a single product, and controlling this heterogeneity is complicated, due to the number of lysine residues exposed on the antibody surface, such as for ado-trastuzumab emtansine, and the cysteine residues used in creating interchain disulfide bonds, such as for brentuximab vedotin [3]. With too few molecules attached, the ADC may not provide an adequate cytotoxic response or anti-tumor efficacy [3]. On the other hand, too many drug molecules conjugated to an ADC can become unstable, be rapidly recognized by the immune system, produce altered PK and PD properties, and increased toxicity [78]. \n\nIt has been shown previously that a higher DAR leads to greater in vitro potency, though the increased DAR also affects the pharmacological properties of the agent [78,79]. For instance, the conjugation of MMAE in the creation of ADCs, or doxorubicin in high DAR ADCs, resulted in increased aggregation, both believed to be due to their added hydrophobicity [78,80,81]. To offset the hydrophobic detriments of cytotoxic payloads, hydrophilic-based polymer linkers are being evaluated. Preliminary studies of these hydrophilic linkers show that higher DARs (up to a DAR of 20) increase potency, but also maintain the desired biological/pharmacological properties in vivo [79,82]. \n\nThere have been extensive studies on the effects of DAR on the properties of ADCs. One group prepared a series of maytansinoid-coupled ADCs with a DAR range from 2 to 14, using both cleavable and non-cleavable linkers, to evaluate the preclinical and clinical effects of DAR, including in vivo stability, efficacy, and tolerability [79,83].\n...\nOne group prepared a series of maytansinoid-coupled ADCs with a DAR range from 2 to 14, using both cleavable and non-cleavable linkers, to evaluate the preclinical and clinical effects of DAR, including in vivo stability, efficacy, and tolerability [79,83]. Their results showed that agents with a high DAR (average 10, range 7-14) using both linker formats had faster distribution and clearance rates and decreased efficacy in vivo (Figure 4) [79,83]. On the other hand, ADCs with a DAR less than 6 displayed similar clearances, superior in vivo efficacy, and were well tolerated [79,83]. Hambelet et al. demonstrated similar conclusions in a study evaluating MMAE conjugated to a CD30 antibody using a MC-vc-PAB linker [78]. When DARs were manipulated to increase the cytotoxic payload with either 2, 4, or 8 drugs per antibody, the clearance increased [78]. These results may be related to the difference in the rate of uptake of these agents by the MPS and other non-target cells. \n\nAdditionally, the site of conjugation can play a role in augmenting the pharmacology of an ADC. Strop et al. created an ADC with an average DAR ~1.7, but directed conjugation using a novel enzymatic conjugation to precise points on the antibody backbone to create homogenous solutions [84]. Their study reported how the site of conjugation affected linker stability in a species-dependent manner, where conjugation on the light chain appears to be cleaved more quickly compared to heavy chain conjugation in mice, but stable in rats [84]. Additionally, heavy chain conjugation demonstrated dramatically different PK and faster rate of drug loss, compared to either light chain conjugated ADCs or naked mAbs in rats [84]. The uses of such technologies can allow for increased studies of the role of the linker, linker position, and cytotoxic payload to optimize the pharmacology and improve the therapeutic index of these agents.",

Linkers, which are generally divided into cleavable and non-cleavable types, are designed to be stable in the bloodstream while allowing efficient release of the small molecule cytotoxin after internalization in the target cell [58]. The stability of antibody-drug linkers in systemic circulation has been a key focus in safety evaluations, since premature loss of the small molecule prior to ADC target cell internalization can result in off-target toxicity from non-specific drug release [59]. Strategies to develop ADCs with more stable linkers and lower levels of unconjugated mAbs have been viewed as critical to the effort to improve ADC pharmacokinetic properties, therapeutic indexes, and safety profiles [13,60]. \n\nAn insufficiently stable linker was thought to represent a possible liability for Mylotarg, although subsequent ADCs utilizing similar acid-labile hydrazone linkers, e.g., inotuzumab ozogamicin and milatuzumab-doxorubicin, have shown good stability in human plasma and serum [14]. However, a comparison of ADCs containing hydrazone linkers with those using protease-sensitive dipeptide linkers showed that the peptide-linked conjugates were much more stable in buffers and plasma than the corresponding hydrazone conjugates, and as a result exhibited more specific delivery and lower systemic toxicity [61]. These results illustrated the importance of conjugation and linker chemistry in achieving a favorable therapeutic index. \n\nSpecies differences in drug-linker stability can lead to difficulties in evaluating the therapeutic index of an ADC based on nonclinical studies.",

When the drug loading increased, both clearance and volume of distribution increased, but the exposure (AUC) of ADC decreased, reflecting the significant attribute of DAR to PK properties of ADC. \n\nThe systemic stability of the antibody\u2212drug linker is also crucial for delivery of an intact ADC to targetexpressing tumors. Linkers stable in circulation but readily processed in the target cell are necessary for both safety and potency of the delivered conjugate [48]. In general, linker should be stable enough in systemic circulation to deliver drug into tumor cells, but labile to release this fully active payload drug inside the tumor cells. Otherwise, the toxic drug could be released in the bloodstream, causing systemic toxicity. Polson et al. demonstrated that non-cleavable linker (e.g.  is more stable than cleavable linker (e.g. T-DM1) [49]. The non-cleavable linker may have slower deconjugation or lower clearance than cleavable linker and reduced systemic toxicity of ADC in rats presumably due to the reduced release of free drug or other toxic metabolites into the circulation [49]. This is because the cleavable linkers may release drug by lysosomal proteases without the degradation of the mAb component whereas non-cleavable linkers require catabolism of the mAb backbones to release the drug [9 and ref. therein]. In addition, the selection of attachment site can affect stability of cleavable antibody-drug conjugates, as demonstrated in the design of systemically stable cleavable auristatin-based conjugates, offering the means to overcome inherent linker instability by optimal attachment site [48]. \n\nInterestingly, Junutula et al. [50] recently reported a site-specific conjugation method called THIOMAB technology enabling near-uniform, low-level conjugation of cytotoxins (DAR=2) to antitumor antibodies, which displayed an increased tolerability or improved therapeutic index without compromising efficacy.",

ADCs with site-specific conjugation, which are also called THIOMAB TM antibody-drug conjugates (TDCs), have demonstrated an improved therapeutic index in preclinical settings. 5,6 In order to further improve the therapeutic window, a new generation of conjugates that incorporates different linkers and cytotoxic agents is being developed to improve the safety and efficacy profiles. 8][9] This is especially important for drug conjugates such as ADCs and TDCs, which contain linker-drugs that may be susceptible to chemical or enzymatic modifications (e.g., enzyme hydrolysis). 10 rug conjugates bring the payload to the site of the tumor via the circulatory system. To be efficacious, they must retain the drug in circulation long enough to reach the targeted cell, internalize, and release the drug inside the cell to induce cell death. Therefore, understanding the stability of both the linker and drug is valuable when identifying factors for rational conjugate design. As we explore and evaluate different sites of attachment of the linker-drugs to the antibody, various linkers and a variety of drugs with alternative mechanisms of action, the ability to better predict in vivo stability in a timely manner becomes crucial. 2][13][14] Plasma stability has been shown to play an important role in the discovery and development of both small and large molecule drugs. 15,16",

Their clinical success has been demonstrated by the 4 ADCs already approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and more than 60 promising ADCs now in clinical trials. Further advancement of this novel molecular platform could potentially revolutionize current strategies and regimens for treating cancers. The linker structure and antibody-linker conjugation modality critically contribute to ADC homogeneity, circulation stability, pharmacokinetic profiles, tolerability, and overall treatment efficacy. Despite extensive efforts to improve these parameters, most ADC linkers used to date possess linear structures, and therefore accommodate only single payloads. The clinical potential of branched ADC linkers, enabling the installation of two payload molecules, remains unexplored because of the lack of efficient conjugation methods. In addition, according to a recent report, the stability of enzymatically cleavable linkers in mouse circulation is another crucial factor for the successful evaluation of ADCs in preclinical studies. In this review, I present my research group's effort to develop both branched linkers and efficient conjugation methods for constructing dual-loading ADCs with high homogeneity and enhanced potency. I also present a novel tripeptide ADC linker with enhanced stability in mouse circulation. Multidisciplinary experience, approaches, and collaboration are key to successfully advancing our ADC research programs.

In particular, linker design plays a critical role in modulating ADC stability in the systemic circulation and payload release efficiency in the tumors, which thus affects ADC pharmacokinetic (PK), efficacy and toxicity profiles. Previously, we have investigated key linker parameters such as conjugation chemistry (e.g., maleimide vs. disulfide), linker length and linker steric hindrance and their impacts on PK and efficacy profiles. Herein, we discuss our perspectives on development of integrated strategies for linker design to achieve a balance between ADC stability and payload release efficiency for desired efficacy in antigen-expressing xenograft models. The strategies have been successfully applied to the design of site-specific THIOMABTM antibody-drug conjugates (TDCs) with different payloads.

At the same time linkers should be amenable to release the payload after internalization into tumor cells [13]. The number of drug molecules bound to antibody (DAR) and their position would greatly influence the ADCs binding affinity to antigen, aggregation, efficacy, and even safety [14]. \n\nThe most commonly used linkers conjugate the drug to antibody via a covalent bond with either thiol group of cysteines or eplison amine group of lysine on antibody. The presence of four inter-chain disulphide bridges in IgG antibody provides eight maximum possible conjugation sites [15]. Therefore, a drug conjugated via cysteine can have a DAR (No of drug molecules/antibody as measured by chromatography and mass spectrometry) up to 8 depending on the number of cysteine sites conjugated with payload [16][17][18]. In contrast to cysteine conjugation site, conjugation at lysine would generate highly heterogenous mixtures of ADCs with variable DAR ratio since antibodies have up to 30 lysine amino acids available for conjugation.

            "text": "Antibody\u2013drug conjugate (ADC) linkers play an important role in determining the safety and efficacy of ADC. The Ortho Hydroxy-Protected Aryl Sulfate (OHPAS) linker is a newly developed linker in the form of a di-aryl sulfate structure consisting of phenolic payload and self-immolative group (SIG). In this study, using two bioanalytical approaches (namely \u201cbottom-up\u201d and \u201cmiddle-up\u201d approaches) via the liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometric (LC-qTOF-MS) method, in vitro and in vivo linker stability experiments were conducted for the OHPAS linker. For comparison, the valine-citrulline-p-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl (VC-PABC) linker was also evaluated under the same experimental conditions. In addition, the catabolite identification experiments at the subunit intact protein level were simultaneously performed to evaluate the catabolic fate of ADCs. As a result, the OHPAS linker was stable in the in vitro mouse/human plasma as well as in vivo pharmacokinetic studies in mice, whereas the VC-PABC linker was relatively unstable in mice in vitro and in vivo. This is because the VC-PABC linker was sensitive to a hydrolytic enzyme called carboxylesterase 1c (Ces1c) in mouse plasma. In conclusion, the OHPAS linker appears to be a good linker for ADC, and further experiments would be warranted to demonstrate the efficacy and toxicity related to the OHPAS linker.",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are a class of targeted therapeutics currently used for the selective destruction of cancer cells. 1 \u22123 Most of these conjugates are prepared by linking potent cytotoxic agents or other functional components through a variety of linkers to cysteine or lysine residues on the antibody. 4 Ideally, ADCs should remain intact in the bloodstream and efficiently release their payload in the target cell for maximum efficacy and minimal toxicity. Similarly, it needs to be considered that the inherent properties of the antibody, together with the conjugation chemistry, the linker, and the cytotoxic molecule used, strongly influence the druglike properties of the resulting conjugates and their stability. 5 It is known that reactive thiols present in plasma molecules, for example, in glutathione or Cys-34 in albumin, may react with the conjugates and reduce their stability in vivo. 6,7 In the context of artificial enzymes, for example, it is well known that the engineering of proximal amino acids in the active site can affect their activity significiantly. 8,9 Similarly, it is known that the chemical and steric environment of the conjugation site is known to modulate both the conjugation and deconjugation properties of the linkers and thus, in the latter case, their stability and efficacy. 10,11 Vollmar et al. reported that modulation of the pK a of the thiol of a cysteine residue could affect the stability of ADCs. Specifically, conjugates that present a higher thiol pK a yielded more stable conjugates. 12 On the other hand, the steric influence on the stability of conjugates attached by disulfide chemistry was studied by Steiner et al. Derivatives with longer linkers, and thus less steric hindrance, were reported to be more prone to reduction and concomitant drug release, resulting in a decreased stability of the conjugates. 13 The site of conjugation has also been reported to affect the extent of off-target cleavage of valinecitrulline linkers by serum proteases. 11",

            "text": "The chemical conjugation of the antibody and the cytotoxic payload has a major influence on the pharmacokinetics, selectivity, and the therapeutic index of ADC-based therapies [12]. A linker is the required covalent connection between the cytotoxic compound and the antibody. The linker influences the stability and drug to antibody ratio (DAR) of the therapeutic agent. These parameters are critical for the overall success of an ADC-based design. With the high potency of the payloads chosen, linkers must be stable within the bloodstream to limit early payload release and allow tumour site targeting to occur. However, this stability must be context-dependent: once inside the cell, these linkers must be efficient in releasing the payload to induced the cytotoxic effect [13].\n\nConventional ADC conjugation involves methods of alkylation of reduced interchain disulphides and alkylation or acylation of lysine residues [9]. These conjugation methods generate heterogeneous mixtures of ADCs with variable drug per antibody ratios (DARs). This varies between zero and eight conjugated payloads per antibody [14]. T-DM1, for example, has on average a DAR of 3.5 [15]. The position and number of payloads bound to the antibody can have profound effects on the binding to the antigen, the aggregation of the ADC, the pharmacokinetic characteristics of the antibody construct, and even the safety profile of the ADC [16].\n\nImproving the antibody site for linker conjugation has been greatly enhanced through advancements in protein engineering. Antibody site-specific alterations enhance linker conjugation and result in homogeneous ADCs. These alterations can be mediated through enzymatic conjugation or insertion of reactive cysteine or chemoselective functional groups of unnatural amino acid residues into the antibody protein sequence [17]. The covalent connection between drug and antibody has been traditionally mediated through the thiol group of cysteine or the epsilon amino group of lysine residues [18].\n\nThe majority of ADCs in clinical trials attach the linker to a cysteine of the antibody. Cysteines are present within the intra and inter",

            "text": "First generation oncology ADCs in the 1990s were based on murine or chimeric antibodies which were plagued with immunogenicity issues [16] and linker instability [17]. Immunogenicity of protein therapeutics has a critical impact on the pharmacokinetics and drug disposition and ultimately clinical success [18,19]. These molecules were designed to deliver a variety of protein toxins [20] and microtubule binding drugs [21] as the cytotoxic payloads. Limited antigen density on tumors, low potency of the payloads, and the low average drug-antibody-ratio (DAR ~3-4) prevented efficacious quantity of drug delivered, which was proposed to be one of the reasons for initial ADC failures, while higher DAR conjugates suffered from toxicity and low therapeutic index. Second generation ADCs from the last 10+ years approved by the FDA were armed humanized antibodies coupled to stabilized linkers and more potent payloads, such as auristatins, calicheamicins, and maytansinoids (Table 1). \n\nIn an ideal situation, ADC payloads should be inactive in circulation when conjugated to an antibody via a linker and remain stably conjugated until the conjugate reaches the target of interest. Upon internalization of the conjugate-target complex, active payload is released inside target cells after lysosomal degradation of the linker or the antibody itself. In addition to reducing target-independent uptake, conjugate stability remains crucial for specific delivery and distribution of payload to the target tissue from systemic circulation. Conjugation sites, chemistries and linker designs coupled with DAR load greatly affect plasma stability, biophysical properties, and consequently pharmacokinetics of the conjugate. Next generation ADCs will likely incorporate fully human antibodies with site-specific conjugation and novel linkers to reduce immunogenicity and optimize biodistribution and payload delivery. These topics will be discussed in this review.",

            "text": "Antibody\u2013drug conjugates (ADCs) represent a therapeutic modality that guides chemotherapies to tumoral cells by using antibodies against tumor-associated antigens (TAAs). The antibody and the chemotherapy or payload are attached by a chemical structure called the linker. The strategy for the development of this type of drug was based on several rational pillars, including the use of a very potent payload and the use of specific antibodies acting only on antigens expressed on tumoral cells. In this article, by using data from all approved ADCs that have received regulatory approval, we analyze the potential contribution of each ADC component to preclinical activity. We suggest that payload potency and the drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) have a less relevant role in relation to efficacy than previously considered. Additionally, we have observed that some ADCs have been developed against antigens also present in non-transformed tissues, which could suggest that TAA specificity is not a mandatory requirement. Finally, we have identified that ADCs with payloads harboring more favorable physicochemical characteristics showed better potential activity. In this article, we also review other aspects that should be taken into consideration for ADC design, including linker structure, stability, conjugation type, pharmacokinetics, receptor internalization, and recycling. Based on currently available data, our study summaries different concepts that should be considered in the design of novel ADCs in the future.",

An appropriate linker between the antibody and the cytotoxic drug provides a specific bridge, and thus helps the antibody to selectively deliver the cytotoxic drug to tumor cells and accurately releases the cytotoxic drug at tumor sites. In addition to conjugation, the linkers maintain ADCs\u2019 stability during the preparation and storage stages of the ADCs and during the systemic circulation period. The design of linkers for ADCs is a challenge in terms of extracellular stability and intracellular release, and intracellular circumstances, such as the acid environment, the reducing environment and cathepsin, are considered as the catalysts to activate the triggers for initiating the cleavage of ADCs.

            "text": "The stability profile of ADCs is significantly more complex than that of the antibodies from which they are derived. As a  result of linker-drug conjugation to an antibody, not only do the common degradation pathways of antibodies remain, the added moieties bring more degradation pathways and instability. 92 For example, the partial reduction step prior to Cys-based conjugation may change the quaternary structure and binding properties of IgG1 antibodies. 93 The hinge-region cysteine of IgG1 may racemize during storage. 94 In addition, the lysine activation step introduces a risk of cross-linking of the activated species. 83 The conjugation step to link a hydrophobic drug molecule to largely hydrophilic surface patches of an antibody often requires addition of significant amounts of organic solvent such as dimethylformamide (DMF) to maintain solubility of the hydrophobic drug and linker. Under these conditions, antibody may aggregate severely, resulting in significant reductions in yield. For example, the conjugation step for Mylotarg requires up to 20% DMF, which causes up to 50% aggregate formation measured by SEC. 95 This can be alleviated to a certain extent by additives such as glycerol, propylene glycol, and octanoic acid, which have been shown to attenuate the aggregation propensity and permit the use of lower DMF concentrations during conjugation reactions. 92 Generally speaking, as the DAR increases, the propensity to form aggregates increases, and it is more pronounced in higher ionic strength solutions. 86,96 Reported results also suggest that partial unfolding of the CH2 and hinge regions of antibody caused by conjugation is responsible for aggregate formation. 85 The increased hydrophobicity imparted by higher DARs may negatively affect in vivo performance of ADCs due to the higher propensity to aggregate or other structural destabilization effects, as reported in a recent study by Lyon et al. showing that the efficacy of auristatin ADCs can be improved by using more hydrophilic linker design or attachment of polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains. 96 The moieties added in an ADC via the drug and linker may introduce more liability to light-",

            "text": "The two recently FDA approved ADCs and growing number of ADCs in the pipeline present promising opportunities in treating various cancers and other diseases. The main optimization parameters in the development of successful ADCs include selection of targets, specificity of mAbs, drug potency, linker stability, and conjugation methods (inter-chain or engineered cysteines, lysines, and Fc glycans). Receptors or cell surface proteins that are overexpressed on tumor cells as compared to normal tissue are good candidate targets. In addition to the usual requirement of therapeutic mAbs, the mAbs used in ADCs must have sufficient aggregation-resistance to withstand the hydrophobicity brought on by adding the drug molecules, and maintain stability and affinity for targets upon conjugation. The selection of antibody isotype, the ability for internalization and tumor penetration are also important. The cytotoxic drugs used in ADCs should be rapidly released in active forms in the intracellular environment. The number of drug molecules in ADCs depend on the method of conjugation, desired potency and linkers [65]. The linkers used in ADCs are a key component, which influences the stability of ADCs and release of drug molecules [66]. Therefore, the choice of linkers used in ADCs profoundly affects the thermal stability, half life, toxicity and the overall efficacy of the ADCs [67]. In order to render better control on the drug/linker conjugation sites on antibodies and the desired DAR, better linker and conjugation methods are needed, as well as rational approaches for improving physicochemical properties and therapeutic index of ADCs.",

            "text": "Third, the molecular structure of the drug has to be small to reduce the risk of immunogenicity. Finally, it should be soluble in aqueous buffers to facilitate conjugation to antibodies and to limit aggregation of the resulting ADC. \n\nAs noted in the chapter by Birte Nolting (Pfizer), one of the biggest challenges in the development of ADCs has been the generation of suitable linkers for the conjugation of antibody and drug. The role of the linker is fundamental because, in addition to efficient delivery of the cytotoxic drug, the stability of the drug-antibody linkage is a crucial factor in determining the efficacy and toxicity of an ADC, and therefore its therapeutic potential. There are several important considerations regarding the linker component, including the site of attachment on the antibody, the average number of attachment sites per antibody molecule, the cleavability of the linker (ability to disintegrate releasing the drug), and the polarity of the linker. The chapter provides an overview of linker technologies currently used for ADCs and advances that have resulted in linkers with improved properties. In addition, considerations for the conjugation of antibody and drug linker, such as drugto-antibody ratio (DAR) and site of conjugation, are discussed. \n\nAs described by Pierre-Yves Abecassis and C\u00e9line Amara (Sanofi), another important part of the design and optimization of ADCs is the in vivo testing of the drug-linker stability. Monitoring in vivo drug-linker stability is critical to the linker selection process. It is performed by identifying the pharmacokinetics (PK) profiles. PK properties of ADCs are measured by following the profiles of the conjugate (mAb entity carrying at least one drug), the total antibody (mAb entity regardless of drug load), as well as the free drugs and metabolites entities. The chapter focuses on the key analytical methods, such as ELISA immunoassays, turbulent flow chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (TFC-MS/MS), and highresolution mass spectrometry (HRMS).",

            "text": "In addition to the linker, the conjugation site can also have a significant influence on the stability of an ADC during circulation, and hence, its overall pharmacological activity. The availability of many different site-specific conjugation methods [51] has made it possible to choose suitable sites on the antibody for payload attachment. The thiol-maleimide Michael addition chemistry is a commonly used method because of its robustness and chemospecificity. The reaction leads to a succinimide thioether linkage formed with either native or engineered cysteine residues in the antibody. However, the maleimide exchange with thiols present in certain plasma components can result in deconjugation, which negatively affects ADC efficacy and safety. The succinimide ring can also undergo hydrolysis to produce a stable linkage which cannot further undergo retro-Michael elimination and is therefore beneficial for ADC activity. Shen et al. have shown that the different solvent accessibility and chemical environment of different conjugation sites can have different effects on the above-mentioned two reactions, which in turn affects the stability and efficacy of the corresponding ADCs [52]. It is interesting to note that conjugation site-dependent payload loss in plasma was observed not only with the ValCit-PABC linkers, but also with the non-cleavable linkers. The results from this study seem to show that the decrease in DAR was due to chemical deconjugation; however, one may not completely exclude the possibility that the enzymatic cleavage of the ValCit-PABC linker also played a role, though likely to a much lesser extent. Bioconjugation using microbial transglutaminase (mTG) has been used to assess how the stability of the antibody-drug linker is influenced by the site of the conjugation. In a study conducted by Dorywalska et al., it is shown that the conjugation site critically affects the enzymatic susceptibility of the ValCit-PABC linker to unidentified serine proteases in mouse plasma (likely Ces1C), of which there is a positive correlation between linker stability and ADC cytotoxic potency both in vitro and in vivo [53].",

            "text": "The Val-Ala linker of typical ADCs connects with payloads via p-aminobenzyl (PAB) as the spacer, a methylsulfonyl modification was applied on the PAB group to enhance the plasma stability of FZ-AD005. FZ-AD005 exhibited excellent plasma stability in vitro compared with DS-8201 and precise DXd release upon internalization into the lysosomes (Figs. 2B and 4B). In vivo, minimal differences were observed between the ADC and total antibody pharmacokinetic profiles, further demonstrating the stability of this innovative linker-payload (Fig. 7). Moreover, low plasma concentrations of free DXd resulted in minimal systemic exposure, with an AUC 0-t of approximately 18.6 \u00b1 8.82 (hour \ufffd ng/mL) at 10 mg/kg (Supplementary Table S3). The reduced exposure may account for the reduced toxicity of FZ-AD005 in monkeys. Linker plays a critical role in influencing ADC stability, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and toxicity profiles (35,36). Stabilized linkers may mitigate offtarget toxicity associated with linker cleavage: a problem often encountered in conventional ADCs. For instance, DS-8201 demonstrated higher stability and lower free drug release than conventional ADCs (37,38) and exhibited a compelling safety profile in clinical applications (39,40). \n\nFc-silencing technology was introduced in FZ-AD005 to eliminate binding to Fc\u03b3Rs (Supplementary Fig. S4A-S4C; Supplementary Table S2), as most dose-limiting toxicities are thought to be caused by irrelevant uptake-mediated off-target toxicity in normal cells (41)(42)(43). The Fc-silencing mutation was also applied in durvalumab, an anti-PDL1 antibody, and clinical data of durvalumab demonstrated that Fc-silencing mutation do not induce severe immunogenicity which may affect efficacy and safety of the drug. In vitro studies showed that FZ-AD005 exhibited negligible ADCC, CDC, and ADCP effects (Fig. 3).",

ADCs are usually comprised of 0 to 8 cytotoxic payloads with an average DAR of 2 to 4 per mAb, which are thus heterogeneous mixtures of conjugates. Given that low payloads reduce potency and high payloads negatively impact PK, the DARs can have a significant impact on ADC efficacy [3]. Structurally, the antibody component of the ADC accounts for the majority of the therapeutic agent (approximately 98 % of total ADC by molecular weight). Biologically, the PK of ADCs is strongly influenced by the underlying antibody backbone conferring properties such as target specific binding, neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)-dependent recycling and Fc (fragment, crystallizable) effector functions [24]. Compared with the unconjugated antibody, ADCs can exhibit somewhat higher clearance due to introduction of an additional metabolic pathway (i.e. cleavage of the drug from the antibody by lysosomal peptide degradation). Furthermore, linker stability, DAR and site of drug conjugation can largely impact PK behaviors and distribution as well. Conjugation with higher DAR tends to have faster clearance than conjugation with lower DAR as an example of cAC10-vc MMAE ADCs with high DARs exhibiting a faster total antibody clearance than lower DAR ADCs [47]. Variable DARs and attachment sites by a consequence of current random conjugation methods result in heterogeneous ADCs with PK parameters that can vary substantially compared to the unconjugated antibody [24]. Hamblett et al. compared ADCs with different drug loading (MMAE conjugated to the anti-CD30 mAb) and concluded that the therapeutic index was increased by decreasing drug loading per antibody, demonstrating that drug loading is a key design parameter for antibody-drug conjugates [47]. It was shown that the terminal half-lives did not directly correlate with drug loading.",

Their results showed that agents with a high DAR (average 10, range 7-14) using both linker formats had faster distribution and clearance rates and decreased efficacy in vivo (Figure 4) [79,83]. On the other hand, ADCs with a DAR less than 6 displayed similar clearances, superior in vivo efficacy, and were well tolerated [79,83]. Hambelet et al. demonstrated similar conclusions in a study evaluating MMAE conjugated to a CD30 antibody using a MC-vc-PAB linker [78]. When DARs were manipulated to increase the cytotoxic payload with either 2, 4, or 8 drugs per antibody, the clearance increased [78]. These results may be related to the difference in the rate of uptake of these agents by the MPS and other non-target cells. \n\nAdditionally, the site of conjugation can play a role in augmenting the pharmacology of an ADC. Strop et al. created an ADC with an average DAR ~1.7, but directed conjugation using a novel enzymatic conjugation to precise points on the antibody backbone to create homogenous solutions [84]. Their study reported how the site of conjugation affected linker stability in a species-dependent manner, where conjugation on the light chain appears to be cleaved more quickly compared to heavy chain conjugation in mice, but stable in rats [84]. Additionally, heavy chain conjugation demonstrated dramatically different PK and faster rate of drug loss, compared to either light chain conjugated ADCs or naked mAbs in rats [84]. The uses of such technologies can allow for increased studies of the role of the linker, linker position, and cytotoxic payload to optimize the pharmacology and improve the therapeutic index of these agents.",

            "text": "ADC efficacy is determined by the systemic stability of the antibody-drug linkage prior to internalization and its efficient intracellular processing to allow toxin release within the target cell. The high stability of the transglutaminase-generated antibody-drug amide linkage [17,21] provided us with a unique opportunity to investigate metabolic processes that may be acting upon conjugates with purportedly more stable non-cleavable linker-payloads. Initially, we generated a series of conjugates using the Amino-PEG6-Propionyl-MMAD payload (PEG6-C2-MMAD), a potent analogue of the antimitotic agent Dolastatin 10 [22], attached to specific sites across the anti-M1S1 C16 antibody (Fig 1a and 1b). To evaluate linker-payload stability, we performed comparative in vitro plasma stability assays by incubating conjugates in mouse plasma, purifying them and comparing their drug-antibody ratio (DAR) to that of untreated conjugates. Unlike the cleavable Aminocaproyl-valine-citrulline-p-aminobenzylcarbamate (C6-VC-PABC) linker [21], the non-cleavable PEG6-C2-MMAD-derived conjugates remained stable across most of the sites tested over a 4.5 day incubation period in mouse plasma, with both the transglutaminase linkage and the Amino-PEG6 linker intact. However, we discovered a position-dependent degradation of the C terminus of MMAD (Fig 1b, Table 1), initially observed by hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) as a decrease in retention time of the ADC following plasma exposure. We subsequently identified the degradation by mass spectrometry as a loss of 186 Da, which is consistent with the hydrolytic cleavage of the C-terminal dolaphenine residue of MMAD (Fig 2a  In contrast to the cleavage observed in mouse plasma, the degradation of the MMAD C terminus was minimal to undetectable in rat, cynomolgus monkey, and human plasma in vitro under the conditions studied (Fig 3).",

Furthermore, this ADC disposition model offers a conceptual framework for the design of ADC and facilitates the preclinical-toclinical translation. The PK model described above has been applied in auristatin-based anti-5T4 antibody-drug conjugates (Shah et al., 2014). It was discovered that the stability of the payload on the ADC and tumor size are the two most influential factors to the payload exposure in plasma. The linker controls the stability of payload and its dissociation from the antibody. The occurrence of extracellular dissociation increases the systemic exposure of toxic payload and results in a severe adverse effect. Therefore, it offered a rationale to modify the linker to increase the stability of the payload on ADC. Also, the sensitivity analysis suggested an increase in tumor size may lead to a rise in payload exposure in plasma. When tumors are small and avascular, ADC could only diffuse from the tumor periphery to the tumor. However, as a tumor grows and becomes vascularized, ADC can quickly enter the tumor by diffusion from the vasculature. Subsequently, the payload released from ADC inside of the tumor would also increase and diffuse to the systemic circulation. The author suggested that the difference in tumor size between animals and patients should be considered during the preclinical-toclinical translation.",

            "text": "First generation oncology ADCs in the 1990s were based on murine or chimeric antibodies which were plagued with immunogenicity issues [16] and linker instability [17]. Immunogenicity of protein therapeutics has a critical impact on the pharmacokinetics and drug disposition and ultimately clinical success [18,19]. These molecules were designed to deliver a variety of protein toxins [20] and microtubule binding drugs [21] as the cytotoxic payloads. Limited antigen density on tumors, low potency of the payloads, and the low average drug-antibody-ratio (DAR ~3-4) prevented efficacious quantity of drug delivered, which was proposed to be one of the reasons for initial ADC failures, while higher DAR conjugates suffered from toxicity and low therapeutic index. Second generation ADCs from the last 10+ years approved by the FDA were armed humanized antibodies coupled to stabilized linkers and more potent payloads, such as auristatins, calicheamicins, and maytansinoids (Table 1). \n\nIn an ideal situation, ADC payloads should be inactive in circulation when conjugated to an antibody via a linker and remain stably conjugated until the conjugate reaches the target of interest. Upon internalization of the conjugate-target complex, active payload is released inside target cells after lysosomal degradation of the linker or the antibody itself. In addition to reducing targetindependent uptake, conjugate stability remains crucial for specific delivery and distribution of payload to the target tissue from systemic circulation. Conjugation sites, chemistries and linker designs coupled with DAR load greatly affect plasma stability, biophysical properties, and consequently pharmacokinetics of the conjugate. Next generation ADCs will likely incorporate fully human antibodies with site-specific conjugation and novel linkers to reduce immunogenicity and optimize biodistribution and payload delivery. These topics will be discussed in this review. While chemotherapy and radiation have been the dominant treatments of cancer for decades, their lack of ability to distinguish between healthy and tumor cells has fueled the desire to create tumor specific delivery of cytotoxic payloads and radionuclides via antibody conjugates.",

            "text": "The stability of antibody\u2013drug conjugates (ADCs) in circulation is critical for maximum efficacy and minimal toxicity. An ADC reaching the intended target intact can deliver the highest possible drug load to the tumor and reduce off-target toxicity from free drug in the blood. As such, assessment of ADC stability is a vital piece of data during development. However, traditional ADC stability assays can be manually intensive, low-throughput, and require large quantities of ADC material. Here, we introduce an automated, high-throughput plasma stability assay for screening drug release and aggregation over 144 h for up to 40 ADCs across five matrices simultaneously. The amount of ADC material during early drug development is often limited, so this assay was implemented in 384-well format to minimize material requirements to <100 \u03bcg of each ADC and 100 \u03bcL of plasma per species type. Drug release and aggregation output were modeled using nonlinear regression equations to calculate formation rates for each data type. A set of 15 ADCs with different antibodies and identical valine\u2013citrulline\u2013p-aminobenzylcarbamate\u2013monomethylauristatin E linker-drug payloads was tested and formation rates were compared across ADCs and between species, revealing several noteworthy trends. In particular, a wide range in aggregation was found when altering only the antibody, suggesting a key role for plasma stability screening early in the development process to find and remove antibody candidates with the potential to create unstable ADCs. The assay presented here can be leveraged to provide stability data on new chemistry and antibody screening initiatives, select the best candidate for in vivo studies, and provide results that highlight stability issues inherent to particular ADC designs throughout all stages of ADC development.",

            "text": "They may not release drugs into the extracellular space and cannot kill neighboring tumor cells through the bystander effect [18]. Furthermore, optimal linker selection depends on the chosen target antigen. Protease-cleavable linkers are also designed to be stable in plasma, but rapidly release the active drug within lysosomes in cancer cells upon cleavage by lysosomal enzymes [19]. They take advantage of the high levels of protease activity inside lysosomes and include a peptide sequence recognized and cleaved by these proteases. The primary goal of all linkers in ADCs is to ensure the specific release of the active drug within target cells, which is essential for controlling the toxicity of the highly potent drugs used to construct ADCs. However, the balance between efficacy and toxicity changes for the above-mentioned linkers. Moreover, the ideal linker chemistry choice ultimately depends on experimentally determining the optimal combination of the suitable linker, the ideal target antigen, and the desired payload [20,21]. A comprehensive understanding of the structural integrity of the linker, the payload and the conjugation site during biological exposure is crucial throughout the process of novel linker-payload design and optimization of the PK profile [22]. This understanding represents a key aspect in maximizing efficacy while minimizing toxicity in preclinical testing and it is essential for ensuring the successful translation to the clinical setting [23,24]. \n\nThis bioconjugate modality's complexity is a source of significant challenge for analytical investigation and analysis, especially in vivo [25]. Nowadays, both Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) and Liquid Chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) have been employed to support ADC discovery and development projects [26,27]. Ligand-binding assays (LBAs) are considered the golden standard to measure antibody concentration (both total and conjugated antibody analytes), whereas LC-MS methods are usually employed to quantify both free and conjugated toxin [28,29].",

            "text": "On the other hand, an alternative chemical modification to introduce proximal steric hindrance around the cleavable or labile site of the linker has been demonstrated to be an effective method of improving stability (Erickson et al., 2006;Pillow et al., 2017;Sadowsky et al., 2017;Anami et al., 2018) and references therein. ADC biotransformation and drug-antibody-ratio (DAR) profiling have become the essential integrated information for assessing and understanding ADC stability (Xu et al., 2013;Su et al., 2018). \n\nOur previous research suggested that aHER2-MMAE TDC efficacy correlated with systemic stability (Shen et al., 2012). The site choice of conjugation is a primary parameter by which ADC stability and, thus, efficacy can be modulated. Our most recent investigation further elaborated the underlying reason for such relationships and confirmed that steric shield resulting from different conjugation sites was a primary factor for their modulation of ADC stability (Su et al., 2018). The steric shield provided by the antibody can help to reduce linker deconjugation/ cleavage as well as payload metabolism. For example, sites HC-A118, LC-K149 and HC-A140 (according to EU numbering), (Ohri et al., 2018), provided enhanced ADC stability with decreased fractional solvent accessibility (FSA) corresponding to increased steric shield around the conjugation site. Based on this, another primary factor, linker length, was then varied to modulate ADC stability through the influence on the steric shield from the distance between antibody and the payload/drug (Su et al., 2018;Su et al., 2019). We discovered that a shorter linker typically results in better ADC stability by tethering the payload further inside the steric shield of the antibody relative to a longer linker.",

This design confers increased specificity and reduced toxicity compared to conventional pharmaceutics such as genotoxic drugs 1e3 .\n\nAs a novel class of therapeutics, ADCs are embracing everevolving technologies in linker and payload chemistry. Specifically, linkers can be classified as cleavable chemical spacers involving hydrozone, disulfide and di/tri/tetra-peptide bonds and noncleavable spacers such as thioether and pyrophosphate diester 4 . The differences in chemical stability conferred by linkers lead to varied catabolic profiles and hence ADC therapeutic efficacies in target cells or organelles. Moreover, highly potent cytotoxic agents with defined mechanisms of action such as maytansinoid and auristatin with microtubule inhibitory functions or DNA double-strand breakers, cross-linkers and alkylators are often selected as payloads 5 . In addition, the site of conjugation, lysine or cysteine residues, also affects ADC catabolic and pharmacokinetic liabilities 6 . Collectively, the plethora of choices offered by conjugation site, linkers and payloads confers versatile combinations, leading to currently over 100 ADCs in clinical trials and numerous ADCs as preclinical candidates 7,8 . Therefore, the concomitant task of druggability screening and quality assessment for ADC candidates becomes challenging, necessitating an approach that efficiently and comprehensively evaluates ADC attributes before proceeding to expensive and time-consuming in vivo experiments 8,9 .

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are now established as an important class of therapeutics for the treatment of cancer. There are currently seven FDA-approved ADCs, with at least 60 more in clinical development. 1 The success of ADCs arises from the combination of the exquisite cell-selectivity of monoclonal antibodies and the cytotoxicity of small molecule chemotherapies. However, for the mAb and drug to exert their maximum therapeutic potential, the covalent linker between the two groups must exhibit the following properties: (1) high plasma stability; the long circulatory lifetimes (t 1/2 > 1 week) of ADCs places stringent stability requirements on the linker to avoid off-target payload release. (2) High aqueous solubility to aid bioconjugation of lipophilic payloads and avoid antibody aggregation. (3) Release of a potent cytotoxin from the antibody in the target cell. 2 The majority of ADCs employ antibodies that target internalising antigens, overexpressed on the surface of certain cancer cells. Upon antibody-antigen binding at the target cell, the ADC is endocytosed and trafficked to the highly hydrolytic lysosomal compartments, where the antibody is broken down into its constituent amino acids. 3 In the case of a non-cleavable linker, the active intracellular cytotoxin is released as the linker-payload with the terminal amino acid from the mAb still attached. 4 Conversely, a cleavable linker is designed to release the unmod-i\ue103ed drug at this point, or upon subsequent entry to the cytosol.\n\nCleavable linkers are generally preferred to non-cleavable linkers in ADC research for a number of reasons. 5 First, traceless drug release allows the unmodi\ue103ed payload to perform its intracellular function without an unwanted linker appendage, thereby maximising cytotoxicity. Second, the unmodi\ue103ed payload can be uncharged, allowing it to diffuse into 'bystander' tumour cells that may not be expressing the target antigen. This 'bystander effect' provides an important mechanism for eradicating tumours with heterogeneous antigen expression. 6 Enzyme",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are an established class of biotherapeutics allowing for targeted drug delivery, with approvals leveraging a range of targets, payloads and conjugation site/chemistries (Dumontet et al. 2023). In addition to target/antibody selection, ADC technology encompasses multiple modalities of conjugation methods, targeted amino acids, drug linkers, conjugated small molecules, and drug loading, i.e. the drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR). Optimisation of the DAR is a critical step in ADC development, requiring thorough evaluation of potency, toxicity, and pharmacokinetic (PK) properties. Toxicity profiles of auristatin ADCs in clinical studies, regardless of therapeutic target, indicate exposure to conjugated payload as the main contributor to some safety events (Drake and Rabuka 2015;Eaton et al. 2015;Liao et al. 2021;Nguyen et al. 2023;Passey et al. 2023): thus highlighting the importance of characterisation and evaluation of drug loading in vivo. \n\nAcross multiple interchain-cysteine maleimide conjugated ADCs, decreases in the DAR have been observed in vivo (Hengel et al. 2014;Leal et al. 2015;Sanderson et al. 2016). In biological systems, the rate of change and resulting DAR at a given time is dependent upon drug-linker deconjugation, stabilisation of the succinimide through ring opening hydrolysis, and potentially differential clearance across ADC drug loads (Hamblett et al. 2004;Lyon et al. 2014). The contribution of each of these to the DAR in vivo is hypothesised to be similar for deconjugation and hydrolysis for a given class of linkage chemistries and conjugation sites. However, the impact from differential clearance may vary depending on the physiochemical properties of the drug linker and impact to overall ADC properties. \n\nPK modelling of each of these contributing factors requires data on the disposition of individual drug load species, a challenge for cysteine conjugated ADCs due to the lack of interchain disulphide bonds, requiring preservation of noncovalent interactions and tertiary structure throughout analysis.",

            "text": "The specificity, efficacy, and safety of an ADC are determined by the design, structure, and chemistry of the linker that connects the cytotoxic payload to the antibody. Linkers are typically designed to be constant in the blood system (enabling for a prolonged timeframe of bloodstream), but labile enough to efficiently deliver the cytotoxic payload to the tumour [51].\n\nCleavable and non-cleavable linkers are the two types of linkers. Following exposure to acidic or reducing environments or proteolytic enzymes, cleavable linkers are cut and release the ADC's cytotoxic payload (for example, Fig. 1 The development, purification, and production of antibody-drug conjugates cathepsins). pH-sensitive hydrazone (found in brentuximab vedotin, enfortumab vedotin, polatuzumab vedotin, trastuzumab deruxtecan, and sacituzumab govitecan) is another enzyme-cleavable peptide-based linker (T-DXd) [51,52].\n\nNon-cleavable linkers are becoming more appealing than cleavable linkers due to the advantage of greater plasma stability. Furthermore, studies show that noncleavable linkers perform far better in vivo, with payload release occurring primarily in the lysosome following ADC internalisation and destruction of both the antibody and the linker (Fig. 2). As a result, the danger of systemic toxicity from premature payload release is reduced. As a result, non-cleavable linkers may offer a wider therapeutic window, as well as increased stability and tolerability [53]. T-DM1 with mafodotin belantamab is one of two FDA-approved ADCs with non-cleavable linkers [18].\n\nThe systemic stability of ADCs post administration is one of the crucial issues to ensure the efficacy of ADCs, and several strategic approaches are taken for overcoming this issue. ADCs should ideally remain stable or intact in the circulation before entering target cells, but there are cases where ADC catabolites are still biologically active [54,55]. ADC stability refers primarily to",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are innovative biopharmaceutical products in which a monoclonal antibody is linked to a small molecule drug with a stable linker. Most of the ADCs developed so far are for treating cancer, but there is enormous potential for using ADCs to treat other diseases. Currently, ten ADCs have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and more than 90 ADCs are under worldwide clinical development. Monoclonal antibodies have evolved from research tools to powerful therapeutics in the past 30 years. Tremendous strides have been made in antibody discovery, protein bioengineering, formulation, and delivery devices. This manuscript provides an overview of the biology, chemistry, and biophysical properties of each component of ADC design. This review summarizes the advances and challenges in the field to date, with an emphasis on antibody conjugation, linker-payload chemistry, novel payload classes, drug-antibody ratio (DAR), and product development. The review emphasizes the lessons learned in the development of oncology antibody conjugates and look towards future innovations enabling other therapeutic indications. The review discusses resistance mechanisms to ADCs, and give an opinion on future perspectives.",

            "text": "2][13][14] Plasma stability has been shown to play an important role in the discovery and development of both small and large molecule drugs. 15,16 Knowing that both the site of conjugation on the antibody and the specific linkerdrug can affect stability, [16][17][18] we wanted to evaluate how stability analysis, typically performed with plasma, can optimally guide drug conjugate development. \n\nSeveral in vitro assays are designed to address ADC stability. Historically, we, as well as others, 19 have used plasma that was collected and stored frozen (this type of material is defined here as \"frozen\" and compared with \"unfrozen\" material) prior to its use evaluating the stability of specific ADCs (e.g. conjugated with the microtubule inhibitor monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) via a cleavable linkers using maleimide chemistry). In vitro stability screening has also been done in the presence of lysosomal enzymes for multiple ADCs. 20 Though we have observed that in vitro plasma stability of certain MMAE ADCs translates well with in vivo outcomes, there were cases with other linker or drugs where the in vitro plasma stability did not correlate as well. In these cases, the discrepancy was either due to the amount of deconjugation of the drug from the antibody or due to a modification to the drug that was not predicted with frozen plasma but occurred in vivo. Similarly, stability screening using human liver S9 fractions showed good correlation with in vivo results for some ADCs evaluated, but the technique presented limitations related to chemical concerns for ADCs containing acid-labile linkers, as well as possible disulfide bond reduction, due to the incubation conditions. Because we wanted to support the design and optimization of novel attachment chemistries and second-generation payloads with different mechanism of actions, we sought to establish an in vitro screening method that best mimicked the stability seen in vivo for all ADCs. The goal was to ensure that not only the attachment chemistry, but also any modifications to the linker or drug, were accurately detected and would predict any unknown in vivo instabilities.",

Cockrell et al. evaluated light exposure in a model ADC system and demonstrated that aggregate and particulate formation specific to the ADC is due to light sensitivity, and these phenomena were not observed in the starting antibody or the linker payload alone. 88 Thermal stability using differential scanning calorimetry was studied by Acchione et al. for a series of lysine-linked, thiol-linked, and carbohydrate-linked model IgG1-biotin conjugates. The primary finding from this work was that the thiol coupling had a greater destabilizing effect on the antibody than lysine coupling. It was also observed that partial antibody reduction using tris-(2-carboxyethyl)-phosphine had very minimal effect on overall thermal stability, suggesting that the observed loss of stability is not directly due to partial reduction of antibody. 79",

            "text": "What happens to macromolecules in vivo? What drives the structure\u2013activity relationship and in vivo stability for antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs)? These interrelated questions are increasingly relevant due to the re-emerging importance of ADCs as an impactful therapeutic modality and the gaps that exist in our understanding of ADC structural determinants that underlie ADC in vivo stability. Complex macromolecules, such as ADCs, may undergo changes in vivo due to their intricate structure as biotransformations may occur on the linker, the payload, and/or at the modified conjugation site. Furthermore, the dissection of ADC metabolism presents a substantial analytical challenge due to the difficulty in the identification or quantification of minor changes on a large macromolecule. We employed immunocapture-LCMS methods to evaluate in vivo changes in the drug-antibody ratio (DAR) profile in four different lead ADCs. This comprehensive characterization revealed that a critical structural determinant contributing to the ADC design was the linker, and competition of the thio-succinimide hydrolysis reaction over retro-Michael deconjugation can result in superb conjugation stability in vivo. These data, in conjunction with additional factors, informed the selection of AZD8205, puxitatug samrotecan, a B7-H4-directed cysteine-conjugated ADC bearing a novel topoisomerase I inhibitor payload, with durable DAR, currently being studied in the clinic for the potential treatment of solid malignancies (NCT05123482). These results highlight the relevance of studying macromolecule biotransformation and elucidating the ADC structure\u2013in vivo stability relationship. The comprehensive nature of this work increases our confidence in the understanding of these processes. We hope this analytical approach can inform future development of bioconjugate drug candidates.",

            "text": "The choice of a suitable linker is a highly sensitive step in ADC manufacturing. First, the conjugate should be stable enough during its circulation in blood serum to avoid damaging body tissues. Second, the programable release of cargo should be easily triggered once the conjugate reaches its target. Thus, a suitable linker should successfully combine serum stability and in-target lability without adversely affecting the stability of the antibody itself upon conjugation [64,65]. \n\nAmong the four known types of linkers, namely hydrazones, disulfides, peptides, and thioethers [57], short peptidyl linkers, such as Val-Cit dipeptide, fulfill the requirements for this critical function and even outperform the tetra-peptidyl linkers (Gly-Phe-Leu-Gly and Ala-Leu-Ala-Leu) previously used and that showed some aggregation issues upon conjugation [57,64,65]. The premature release of the payload in the case of hydrazone (due to pH changes) and disulfide linkers (due to exchange with other thiols, such as glutathione) may influence the potency of the treatment, while the delayed release of cargo in the case of thioether linkers (payload is released only after total degradation of the antibody) may cause the loss of anticancer activity [65,66]. In Padcev TM and Polivy TM , a maleimidocarpoyl moiety is added to the N-terminal of the dipeptide Val-Cit to facilitate conjugation to the antibody. The amide bond formed by the C-carboxyl group of the Cit, which is linked to a self-immolative p-amino benzyl carbamate (PABC) spacer, is stable in serum and can be rapidly hydrolyzed by lysosomal cathepsin-B releasing the PABC-MMAE moiety. This undergoes self-elimination liberating the payload MMAE [57]. The mechanism of drug release is shown in Figure 9.",

As might be expected, the drug plays a major role in ADC activity and characteristics. What might be less intuitive is that the linker between the antibody and drug also is very important. An ideal linker should be stable in circulating blood, but allow rapid release of active free drug inside tumor cells. If a linker is not stable in blood, drug will be lost and ADC activity will be decreased. 15,26 Current linker formats that are being evaluated can be broadly categorized into two groups: cleavable linkers (acidlabile linkers, protease cleavable linkers, and disulfide linkers) and non-cleavable linkers. Acid-labile linkers are designed to be stable at pH levels encountered in the blood, but become unstable and degrade when the low pH environment in lysosomes is encountered (e.g., gemtuzumab ozogamicin). Protease-cleavable linkers are also designed to be stable in blood/plasma, but rapidly release free drug inside lysosomes in cancer cells upon cleavage by lysosomal enzymes. They take advantage of the high levels of protease activity inside lysosomes and include a peptide sequence that is recognized and cleaved by these proteases, as occurs with a dipeptide Val-Cit linkage that is rapidly hydrolyzed by cathepsins (e.g., brentuximab vedotin).\n\nA third type of linker under consideration contains a disulfide linkage.

The ideal linker is systemically stable so that biophysiochemcial property of ADC are similar to that of the unconjugated antibody, but are still able to release the payload at the target site. Extensive research is being conducted to develop novel linkers for ADCs, and the most broadly evaluated and utilized linker platforms include both cleavable and non-cleavable linkers.\n\nCleavable linkers: The cleavable linkers include chemically-labile (e.g., hydrazones and disulfides) and protease-labile linkers. These cleavable linkers are designed to be stable in circulation, but release the toxic payloads due to differences between the extracellular and intracellular microenvironment following internalization of the ADC. For example, the acidlabile hydrazone linker of Mylotarg \u00ae liberates calicheamicin when encountering an acidic pH environment such as found in lysosomes and endosomes (pH 4~6) (van Der Velden et al., 2001;Ulbrich and Subr, 2004). Similarly, disulfide linkers have the advantage of differential reduction potential in the cytosol, so that reduction of the disulfide bond can subsequently liberate payloads, as in the anti-CD56-maytansine conjugate (Saito et al., 2003;Erickson et al., 2006;Chanan-Khan et al., 2010 6 ). It is worth noting that the presence of a stericallyhindered carbon near the sulfur atom in the disulfide linker increases the stability of the disulfide bond, thus providing an equivalent or improved in vitro potency.\n\nThe peptide-based linkers are also designed to be retained in the ADC formin circulation, but to release their payload upon cleavage by specific intracellular proteases. For example, Adcetris \u00ae uses the valine-citrulline (vc) dipeptide linker, which is hydrolyzed by",

The stability of site-specific ADCs is highly increased, which often leads to improved tolerability and a better PK profile in vivo (Strop et al., 2015;Strop et al., 2013). The heavy chain constant region of hD12 was used, and tesirine was conjugated site-specifically to introduced cysteines in the CH2 domain. The product was a homogeneous ADC (97% monomeric) with a DAR of 2 (average DAR 1.96) (Fig. 1, Table S1). Site-specific hD12 SG3249 conjugate was slightly more potent in vitro than stochastically conjugated hD12-SG3249 (32 versus 153 pM) (Table S3). Both ADCs showed similar and significant in vivo antitumor activity at both dose levels compared to a control (P < 0.0001) (Fig. S3A and S3B). The circulating terminal half-life for TR1801-ADC was 14 days in rats (Fig. S3C). Comparing the serum concentrations measured using a Total Antibody PK Assay, which detects both conjugated and unconjugated antibody species, and an ADC PK Assay, which detects only conjugated species, significant deconjugation of payload-linker was not observed. The tolerability in rats was good with continuous body weight gain in all dose groups and no remarkable clinical observations (Fig. S3D). The site-specific cMet hD12-tesirine conjugate was named TR1801-ADC.",

            "text": "As discussed above, ADCs contain three components: mAb, linker, and drug. Among the three components, mAb and linkers are the first to be considered for formulation stabilization, as they are generally less stable than the small molecule drugs. \n\nmAbs generally have reasonable stability, and approximately half of all naked mAb drug products are in liquid dosage form. Their stability can be negatively impacted during and/or following chemical modification for ADCs. Many of the small drug candidates are relatively hydrophobic, such as calicheamicin and paclitaxel, and the addition of a hydrophobic group would enhance the hydrophobicity-driven aggregation tendency. In addition, conjugation via lysine residues may lead to the reduction in the number of protein surface charges and the hydrophilicity of the protein. Thus, the addition of such molecules to antibodies may negatively impact antibody stability [190,191] or solubility [192]. \n\nSome peptide linkers are relatively hydrophobic and can negatively influence the stability of ADCs. In the preparation of a mAb and doxorubicin conjugate using Phe-Lys or Val-Cit as a linker, the formation of non-covalent dimer was observed immediately upon conjugation [185]. In another example, the addition of a hydrophilic methoxytriethylene glycol chain onto doxorubicin, via a hydrazone bond, has been reported to greatly inhibit the aggregation of final conjugates, most likely due to the hydrophobic nature of these peptides [193]. \n\nIdeally, the linkers are stable enough to prevent the generation of any amount of free cytotoxic drugs during formulation, manufacturing process, shipping, and storage. The reality is that most cleavable linkers discussed above possess limited in vitro stability. For example, the conjugate vaccine amAb-KLH, linked via succinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)-cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC), is stable in PBS (pH 7.2) only at \u221280 \u00b0C, and significant release of free mAb was observed at 4 \u00b0C over 6 months of storage [194].",

Here, the chemical structures and concentrations of intratumor catabolites were investigated to better understand the drivers of ADC in vivo efficacy. Anti-CD22 disulfide-linked pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD-dimer) conjugates containing methyl- and cyclobutyl-substituted disulfide linkers exhibited strong efficacy in a WSU-DLCL2 xenograft mouse model, whereas an ADC derived from a cyclopropyl linker was inactive. Total ADC antibody concentrations and drug-to-antibody ratios (DAR) in circulation were similar between the cyclobutyl-containing ADC and the cyclopropyl-containing ADC; however, the former afforded the release of the PBD-dimer payload in the tumor, but the latter only generated a nonimmolating thiol-containing catabolite that did not bind to DNA. These results suggest that intratumor catabolite analysis rather than systemic pharmacokinetic analysis may be used to better explain and predict ADC in vivo efficacy. These are good examples to demonstrate that the chemical nature and concentration of intratumor catabolites depend on the linker type used for drug conjugation, and the potency of the released drug moiety ultimately determines the ADC in vivo efficacy.",

            "text": "Although peptide motifs represent the majority of cleavable linkers used in clinical-stage antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), the sequences are often sensitive to cleavage by extracellular enzymes, such as elastase, leading to systemic release of the cytotoxic payload. This action reduces the therapeutic index by causing off-target toxicities that can be dose-limiting. For example, a common side-effect of ADCs made using peptide-cleavable linkers is myelosuppression, including neutropenia. Only a few reports describe methods for optimizing peptide linkers to maintain efficient and potent tumor payload delivery while enhancing circulating stability. Herein, we address these critical limitations through the development of a tandem-cleavage linker strategy, where two sequential enzymatic cleavage events mediate payload release. We prepared dipeptides that are protected from degradation in the circulation by a sterically-encumbering glucuronide moiety. Upon ADC internalization and lysosomal degradation, the monosaccharide is removed and the exposed dipeptide is degraded, liberating the attached payload inside the target cell. We used CD79b-targeted monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) conjugates as our model system, and compared the stability, efficacy, and tolerability of ADCs made with tandem-cleavage linkers to ADCs made using standard technology with the vedotin linker. The results\u2014where rat studies showed dramatically improved tolerability in the hematopoietic compartment\u2014highlight the role that linker stability plays in efficacy and tolerability, and offer a means of improving an ADC\u2019s therapeutic index for improved patient outcomes.",

            "text": "The production of an ADC requires the conjugation of cytotoxic molecules with a molecular mass in the region of two orders of magnitude smaller than the antibody, via synthetic linkers (again of significantly smaller mass than the antibody), to enable cell killing following cell-surface target recognition and binding by the antibody component of the ADC. Characterization of the effect of antibody conjugation on thermal stability and antigen binding using SPR has previously been described [21]. Whilst different conjugation chemistries vary in their effect on thermal stability, thiol conjugation of IgG1 antibodies is reported to reduce the antibody melting temperature but have no effect on antigen binding in vitro [21]. To investigate the effect of drug-linker conjugation, two of our antibodies, RBGO1 and RBGO3, were conjugated to the antimitotic agents monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), via a lysosomally cleavable dipeptide valine-citrulline (vc) linker (vcE; see Figure S1A); or monomethyl auristatin F (MMAF), via a non-cleavable maleimido caproyl (mc) linker (mcF; see Figure S1B) and captured onto a CM5 sensor chip via amine coupled anti-mouse antibodies. Characterization of binding kinetics before and after conjugation to vcE was performed using rRAGE (2.5 to 200nM; RBGO1) or aa198-217 (2.5 to 200 nM; RBGO3) and binding/dissociation rates determined using a one-to-one binding model, see Figure 5. Conjugation of the RBGO3 antibody, see Figure 5A,B, resulted in a four-fold reduction in antigen binding affinity (K D : conjugated = 1.95 \u00b1 0.03 nM vs unconjugated = 0.47 \u00b1 0.04 nM, p < 0.05), whilst conjugation of the RBGO1 antibody had no discernible effect on K D (conjugated = 0.63 \u00b1 0.02 nM vs unconjugated = 0.67 \u00b1 0.03 nM, see Figure 5C,D).",

            "text": "The conventional processes to conjugate linker-drugs to antibodies (lysine conjugation or conjugation to cysteines derived from reduction of inert-chain disulfide bonds) produces ADCs with heterogeneous mixtures of multiple species with different drug loads: DAR of 0-8 (10). \n\nEach of these DAR species could potentially have distinct PK properties and activities (28,38). While in vitro potency could increase with increase in drug load per antibody, it does not always follow that in vivo efficacy and safety profiles will also improve (28). Hambelet et al. (28), made ADCs with an anti-CD30 antibody (cAC10) conjugated to MMAE with the MC-vc-PAB linker with either two, four, or eight drugs per antibody. ADCs with lower drug loads (DAR of 2 or 4) had slower clearance values, longer half-lives and were better tolerated in mice compared to an ADC with a higher drug load (DAR of 8). In addition, the DAR4 ADC showed equivalent in vivo antitumor activity to the DAR8 ADC at equal antibody doses despite having half the amount of MMAE. Similar results were seen in a rat study with trastuzumab-MCvc-PAB-MMAF conjugates (DAR of 2, 4, and 6), where the ADCS with the higher drug loads cleared faster and were less tolerated compared to conjugates with lower drug loads (39). \n\nThe next generation ADC efforts have focused on eliminating this heterogeneity by using site-specific conjugation methods to produce a more homogenous ADC to improve stability, PK, and therapeutic index, as shown in several recent studies (17,29,40,41). These conjugation strategies include the use of engineered cysteines, unnatural amino acids, and enzymatic conjugation through glucotransfersases and transglutaminases (10). A recent study at Genentech using site-specific conjugation with engineered cysteines (THIOMAB\u2122 technology) showed that chemical and structure dynamic of the conjugation site can influence the stability of the ADC (17).",

            "text": "linkers are a double-edged sword; such ADCs are more toxic in an acute setting. Still, cleavable-linker ADCs are likely to be the format of choice for many targets, particularly those with less internalization, lower copy number, or heterogeneous tumor expression (5). Indeed, the only marketed ADC, gemtuzumab ozogamicin, has an acid-cleavable linker (28). We and others (7) have hypothesized that uncleavable linker ADCs would be safer than ADCs with cleavable linkers. We tested this in a general way by using a rat model system in which the antibody was not targeted to any rat antigen, and found that, indeed, the uncleavable linker ADCs showed reduced toxicity compared with their cleavable counterparts. The faster decrease in the amount of cleavable linker ADC compared with the total antibody suggests that this is due to the release of free drug or linker-drug metabolite(s). In the context of safety, it is also important to note that there are differences in the metabolites that arise from cleavable and uncleavable linkers. For example, the reported metabolite of Ab-MCC-DM1 is lysine-MCC-DM1, a charged molecule that is relatively impermeant to cells (8). If released into the circulation, this molecule would presumably permeate normal tissues to a lesser extent than free DM1, for example. Thus, the increased safety of uncleavable linkers observed in this study could be a combination of both reduced drug release as well as differing properties of the metabolites.\n\nAlthough cleavable SPP-DM1 resulted in efficacy in vivo when conjugated to antibodies to all seven NHL targets, uncleavable linker MCC-DM1 ADCs were only effective when targeted to two of them, CD22 and CD79b. These data suggest that ADCs targeted to CD22 and CD79b would be effective with a wide range of linker-drugs. However, it remains possible that the other antigens we tested could also be effective targets for uncleavable linker ADCs because different antibodies to the same target can sometimes",

            "text": "A generally accepted and important criterion for ADC therapy is that the antibody should internalize, delivering its chemotherapeutic inside the cell, where it is usually metabolized in lysosomes. Despite IMMU-132\u2032s internalization, we believe that the linker in this ADC, which affords local release of SN-38, is likely another feature that sets this platform technology apart from those using an ultratoxic drug, because the released free drug can induce a bystander effect on neighboring cancer cells. Indeed, having an ultratoxic agent linked stably to the IgG is the only configuration that would preserve a useful therapeutic window for those types of compounds. However, using a more moderately-toxic drug does not give the latitude to use a linker that would release the drug too early once in the circulation. Our group explored linkers that released SN-38 from the conjugate with different half-lives in serum, ranging from ~10 h to a highly stable linker, but it was the linker with the intermediate stability that provided the best therapeutic response in mouse-human tumor xenograft models [30,31]. Since this initial work, we showed that a highly stable linkage of SN-38 was significantly less effective than the CL2A linker that has a more intermediate stability in serum [35]. \n\nAnother current tenet of ADC design is to use an ultra-cytotoxic drug to compensate for low levels of antibody accretion in tumors, typically 0.003 to 0.08% of the injected dose per gram [36]. The current generation of ultratoxic-drug conjugates has found a drug:antibody substitution of \u2264 4:1 to be optimal, since higher ratios adversely affected their pharmacokinetics and diminished the therapeutic index by collateral toxicities [48]. In this second-generation ADC technology, we elected to use an IgG-coupling method that site-specifically links the drug to the interchain disulfides through mild reduction of the IgG, which exposes 8 binding sites.",

The junction between the antibody and the payload is generally a covalent bond or a chemical linker, while a fusion construct, including the MAb fragment and the effector joined by a peptide linker, can be devised in the case of an immunotoxin conjugate molecule; thus, expression of the entire polypeptide can be performed in a host. \n\nLinkers are classified into two categories: cleavable and uncleavable (Figure 3). They need to be stable in the circulation and must be cleaved, ideally, only inside the cells, thus preventing the drug payload from being shed before reaching the tumoral cell target. When the linker is unstable in the extracellular space, the free drug subsequently permeates the cell to reach its target. 22 This can be a useful mechanism to enhance on-target activity, but it can also be the cause of offtarget toxicity, which is absent with uncleavable linkers. 21 ncleavable linkers are cut by complete degradation of the MAb component in the lysosome, which leaves an active unit formed by the drug, the linker, and a lysine residue. 23,24 leavable linkers are selectively cleaved upon change of a biophysical property (eg, pH in the case of hydrazone linkers), 21 or when an appropriate protease is found. For example, lysosomal proteases (eg, cathepsin and plasmin) are present at elevated levels in certain tumor tissues. 25 hough established conjugation chemistries and linkers for antibody arming have already led to a significant improvement in therapeutic outcome, 26 a rapid evolution of both into a second generation is already under way.",

Effective linkers have to guarantee ADC stability in the bloodstream as well as to allow an efficient cleavage upon internalization into tumor cells. Linkers can be classified into cleavable and non-cleavable according to their chemical properties [2,6]. Non-cleavable linkers consist of stable bonds resistant to proteolytic degradation, so that cleavage occurs only after lysosome internalization and complete degradation of the antibody. These linkers have higher stability than cleavable ones, but can suffer from lower membrane permeability. Conversely, cleavage of cleavable linkers can depend on external pH (acid-labile linkers), specific lysosomal proteases (protease-cleavable linkers) or glutathione reduction (disulphide linkers) [2,[6][7][8]. All aspects of ADC pharmacology can be influenced by the specific design of the linker, as drug stability into circulation, tumor cell permeability, drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR, i.e. the number of payload moleculas carried by each antibody), and extent of the bystander effect [2,7].",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are a class of novel therapeutics for cancer, which consist of a tumor-targeting monoclonal antibody (mAbs) conjugated to a cytotoxic payload using a chemical linker. Since the first ADC was approved in 2000 by the US Food and Drug Administration, 14 ADCs have been approved worldwide and more than 100 candidates are being investigated in clinical stages at present [1]. Meanwhile, the continued advances in ADC components, including antibody engineering, site-specific conjugation, and novel cytotoxic drugs, have promoted the development of various ADC platforms. However, the bioanalysis of ADCs has been faced with challenges due to their complexity derived from Molecules 2024, 29, 572 2 of 14 the transformation and catabolism of ADCs in vivo. The major analytes for ADCs in preclinical and clinical studies include total antibody, conjugated antibody (total ADC), and free payload. There are a number of factors that should be taken into consideration during the development of bioanalytical methods for ADCs. First, an appropriate assay format should be selected for the analyte of interest. Second, the assays for total antibody and conjugated antibody should ideally be unaffected by the drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) [2][3][4][5][6]. DAR is an important parameter reflecting the number of payloads conjugated to the antibody, and its change over time indicates ADC deconjugation and other biotransformation processes [6]. Third, whether the structure of the payload linked to the antibody undergoes some changes in vivo [7]. For example, camptothecin-based ADCs can undergo a conversion from the lactone ring structure of camptothecins to the carboxylate structure of camptothecins or vice versa, depending upon their pH condition [8]. Such changes, in turn, also cause heterogeneity in the relevant ADC. Last, the extent to which the assay is affected by antidrug antibodies (ADAs) in the sample.",

            "text": "The design of Antibody Drug Conjugates (ADCs) as efficient targeting agents for tumor cell is still in its infancy for clinical applications. This approach incorporates the antibody specificity and cell killing activity of chemically conjugated cytotoxic agents. Antibody in ADC structure acts as a targeting agent and a nanoscale carrier to deliver a therapeutic dose of cytotoxic cargo into desired tumor cells. Early ADCs encountered major obstacles including, low blood residency time, low penetration capacity to tumor microenvironment, low payload potency, immunogenicity, unusual off-target toxicity, drug resistance, and the lack of stable linkage in blood circulation. Although extensive studies have been conducted to overcome these issues, the ADCs based therapies are still far from having high-efficient clinical outcomes. This review outlines the key characteristics of ADCs including tumor marker, antibody, cytotoxic payload, and linkage strategy with a focus on technical improvement and some future trends in the pipeline.",

            "text": "Unique challenges exist when formulating an ADC compared to a naked mAb. As detailed earlier, sample complexity plays a major role in making formulation of a non-site-specific ADC exceptionally difficult due to the diverse array of post conjugation species. In addition, the drugs that are attached to ADCs and the linker by which the drug is attached also instill added complexity to formulate an ADC [65,66]. The drugs associated with ADCs often have less than desirable aqueous solubility characteristics themselves. These drugs have the propensity to cause inter-antibody aggregation through either exposure of protected aggregation-prone regions within the antibody backbone upon conjugation or through drug-drug mediated interactions [67][68][69]. This greatly limits longitudinal stability as well as high concentration formulation capabilities. The drugs that are conjugated to form ADCs are also not the same from ADC to ADC making generalizable formulation protocols difficult to establish [3,4]. \n\nThe means by which the drugs are attached to the antibody is also a unique hurdle that needs special attention when considering formulation of an ADC compared to a naked mAb. Linkers vary in chemical composition providing the ADC with differing cleavable capabilities. Cleavable linkers fall into two primary categories that allow for cleavage either enzymatic digestion or exposure to pH extremes [70][71][72][73][74][75][76]. There is an ever growing list of linker chemistries with distinctive capabilities that are being tested in diverse ADC applications [77]. These desirable delivery characteristics subsequently make the drug and linker susceptible to premature degradation and cleavage during storage which limits the potential formulation compositions considerably when compared to that of formulation of a naked mAb [75,78]. Depending upon the selected linker and the method of conjugation of the linker to the antibody, critical antibody characteristics that directly affect solubility, including surface charge and zeta-potential, can be negatively impacted. For these reasons, drug, linker composition and antibody target are all critical components specifically selected to address the unique demands of the intended therapeutic application and unfortunately result in significantly more complex formulation demands.",

            "text": "Despite the significant development of drugs along with the novel treatment methods available in clinical cancer therapy, the prevalence of cancer still remains to be a formidable challenge, and huge obstacles are there to be solved. The increasing risk of toxicity on patients and limited therapeutic window are the major problems in the current chemotherapies. Various drug delivery systems have been developed to improve the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of these drugs in order to effectively address these issues. \n\nDrug conjugate or prodrug is one of the most successful approaches for these strategies, using various linkers to mask the activity of the drug and connect with drug carrier and targeting agents, which effectively increase the selectivity of the drugs and, very importantly, improve the ADME properties to subtly circumvent all sorts of difficulties of the complex biological system to deliver the potent payload at the right place and at the right time. Linker, as its name implies, is the structural hub for assembly of the other essential components for becoming a complete pro-drug and also plays a significant role in practice to release the payload. \n\nIn recent years, photocleavable linkers have been developed as a non-invasive technology, allowing the controlled release of the active substance with high spatiotemporal precision. Along with the utilization of carriers that take advantage of active targeting strategies such as monoclonal antibodies, this strategy of drug delivery becomes a powerful tool in clinical cancer therapy. As seen from the research on the photoremovable linkers so far, the drug conjugates, especially ADC, have shown minimal off-target toxicity without irradiation and increased stability compared to other conventional ADCs utilizing an internal trigger linker strategy. In addition, the linker modulates ADC stability in the systemic circulation and payload release efficiency, in the meantime affecting ADC pharmacokinetic (PK), efficacy and toxicity profiles. Conjugation chemistry, linker length, and linker steric hindrance are among the key linker parameters to be considered in order to achieve a balance between stability and efficacy in the integrated strategies. This orthogonal release approach, which has demonstrated its potential from previous applications, will be further explored in future research.",

            "text": "In addition to the antibody, the linker and payload components of ADCs are also subject to their own clearance mechanisms. The stability of the linker to premature release of the payload in the systemic circulation has been demonstrated to be a critical ADC ADME component for determining the exposure-response and exposure-toxicity relationships [141]. From a stability perspective, well-behaved ADCs should only release the payload in the intended target tissue to minimize payload toxicity to unintended tissue and maximize efficacy in target tissues/organs, especially with payloads with cytotoxic properties. The ADC linker stability is noted to be a challenge due to the long circulating half-life (days to weeks) imparted by the mAb component resulting in the continuous assault of the linker to endogenous proteases. Mechanistically, linker stability can be evaluated both in vitro using plasma/serum incubations and in vivo following administration to multiple species by following the formation of the released payload and DAR changes over time. As covered above, linker composition continues to be an intense area of focus in the development of ADCs. In terms of the payload, initial reports with limited chemical entities suggested that type of payloads did not impact the PK of ADCs; however, more recent studies of conjugation sites and of site-specific conjugations have demonstrated the connectivity of the site of conjugation with various payloads to impact ADC PK and disposition [142,143]. Engineering ADCs for site-specific conjugation to control the DAR and PK has shown some evidence of improving the TI in non-clinical oncology studies [144]. Approaches such as engineered cysteines, unnatural amino acids, and the inclusion of tags (i.e., selenocysteine, aldehyde, or glutamine) continue to be intense areas of research for the application of site-specific payload conjugation to optimize ADC ADME. \n\nLike mAbs, ADCs are likely trafficked via the vascular and lymphatic systems. The biodistribution of ADCs follows that of the antibody component.",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) have been investigated since the early-1980s [82] for their ability to deliver a therapeutic to a specific target and they represent one of the most solid approaches to improving the pharmacokinetics properties of toxic drugs. Their working mechanism is based on the identification of surface biomarkers that are overexpressed in abnormal cells, representing the target against which the antibody specificity is addressed. ADC technology is composed of three elements comprising the antibody, the drug and a linker connecting these two components [83]. The linker design enables drug targeting via antibody binding and, moreover, determines PK properties of the ADC. This phenomenon is very important to improve the therapeutic properties of drugs affected by fast clearance. Current research in the field is focused on generating antibodies with higher specificity and biocompatibility and improving current synthesis techniques to conjugate multiple therapeutics to the antibodies. However, much effort is also dedicated to developing degradable linkers to favor and control drug release. The first goal of the linker is to guarantee product stability in circulation. However, after reaching the target, the therapeutic molecule has to be released to avoid the unwanted accumulation of the curative payload in not optimal subcellular compartments [84]. In this context, it is important to highlight that if the drug is not released, it will accumulate in proximity to the cell membrane or, in the case of antibody receptor-mediated endocytosis, in the lysosomes. ADC characterized by non-degradable linkers rely on the degradation of the whole antibody to allow drug diffusion in the cytoplasm, but charged residues connected to the payload may hamper this phenomenon [85]. Lysosomal proteases represent an optimal trigger for drug release, and for this reason, the development of linkers sensitive to CtsB activity was extremely investigated. As extensively reported above, CtsB is overexpressed in many cancer cells, representing an additional mechanism of targeting. In addition, this protease can be secreted in the extracellular space favoring the release of the drug molecule, also from the non-internalized antibodies (Figure 3).",

Drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) is the average number of drugs conjugated to an antibody in an ADC; an important attribute of this treatment modality which can affect efficacy, toxicity and pharmacokinetics. For example, low drug loading levels are likely to reduce the potency of the ADC. DAR is often dependent on the amino acid to which the drug is conjugated, for example, in non-specific conjugation there are approximately 40 lysines present within an IgG scaffold to which the drug can attach [28], with DARs between 6 and 14 reported, depending on the chosen linker [29]. In contrast, cysteine residues are far less prevalent with, for example, four exposed disulphides present on IgG1, providing a total of eight conjugation sites. Therefore, conjugation via this site would result in an ADC with a lower DAR [19], with DARs of 2, 4, 6 or 8 typically seen, depending on the linker chemistry [28]. However, although ADCs with higher DARs may appear more potent in vitro, the faster plasma clearance of highly conjugated antibodies can result in lower efficacy in vivo, with decreased drug loading associated with greater efficacy [30]. In addition, the hydrophobicity of the ADC can accelerate clearance, with the use of hydrophilic linkers shown to improve efficacy [31]. Therefore, the careful and informed selection of the correct conjugation chemistry, together with optimal drug loading will play a role in optimising the production of an ADC with the desired efficacy and toxicity profile.",

Recent advances in antibody drug conjugate technology (ADC) allow for the combination of the selectivity of mAbs with the potency of cytotoxic drugs with the goal to reduce systemic toxicity and to increase efficacy and the therapeutic benefit to carcinoma patients. \n\nADCs consist of an antibody conjugated to a cytotoxic drug via a linker. The therapeutic concept of ADCs is to use an antibody as a vehicle to deliver a cytotoxic drug selectively to the tumor tissue by targeting an antigen expressed on the surface of a malignant cell. ADCs are prodrugs that require drug release for activation, which occurs commonly after ADC internalization into the target cell, providing greatly improved tumor-to-normal tissue ratios of ADC drugs compared to systemic chemotherapy. Numerous pre-clinical efficacy studies have shown that ADCs enhance the antitumor activity of \"naked\" antibodies and reduce the systemic toxicity of the cytotoxic drugs conjugated to the antibody. 6,7 mportant parameters for ADC development include the selection of the target antigen, the kinetics and efficacy of conjugate internalization by the tumor cells, the drug potency and the stability of the linker between drug and antibody (reviewed in ref. 8). Other parameters reported to be important include the drug/antibody ratios [9][10][11][12] and the methods used for drug conjugation and their effects on the pharmacodynamic properties of the ADCs. 13 uring the development of ADCs, it became apparent that molecular mechanisms regulating drug linker cleavage, enabling the release of active drug, remained only partially understood.",

Generally, the properties of linkers can be altered by the cytotoxic payload release mechanism 191 . Cytotoxic payload in ADC technology must be released into the cell to exert its therapeutic activity, thus ADC linkers should be chosen based on their stability to keep ADC intact during circulation and capable of cleaving inside the targeted cell 191,192 . Linker stability is defined based on lack/low level of cleaving agents (e.g., protease or reductive agents) in the bloodstream compared to the cytoplasm 163 .\n\nThe current linkers used in ADCs are also broadly classified as cleavable and noncleavable linkers based on where they are cleaved into the cytoplasm. Cleavable linkers are those containing a conditional cleavage sites sensitive to be cleaved immediately after ADC internalization, such as VC, SPDB, SPP, and hydrazine which can be triggered through protease reactions, glutathione reduction, and acidic pH, respectively 163,164 . Noncleavable linkers are stable from early to late endosome transition and their cytotoxic partner is just released by degradation of antibody in lysosomes, e.g. MCC and MC linkers that link Ab to the payload via thioether linkage 190 .\n\nCharacteristics of ADC target such as copy number, internalization rate and level of homogeneity should be considered in conjugation method and linker selection. For instance, ADC with disulfide-linkage has been shown to have more cytotoxic activity than the same ADC with thioether linkage when they were directed to the tumor cell lines expressing a low copy number of targeted antigen 17 .\n\nCleavable linkers may increase the possibility of bystander effect 27 .

Stability of ADCs before they reach target cells is the key to minimize off-target killing and maximize tumor exposure to drugs. Upon internalization of ADCs into cells, linkers should be labile enough to ensure rapid release of drugs into cytoplasm where they bind to tubulins or DNA molecules. Design of linker/spacer is intricately related to how ADC will exert its cytotoxicity intracellularly. The choice of linker determines the release mechanism of drugs that is often limited by chemistry and biology of cancer cells. \n\nHeterobifunctional linkers are commonly used in ADCs [49], because they allow attachment of drugs through disulfide bond and amide bond. A typical example of linker, such as 4-(-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexanecarboxylic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (SMCC) has N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester, which reacts with primary amines to form amide bond, and maleimide group that reacts with sulfhydryl group to form stable thioether bond. Linkers such as N-succinimidyl 4-(2-pyridyldithio)pentanoate (SPP) and N-succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldithiol)butyrate (SPDB) allow amide bond on one end and disulfide bond on the other end, which may be cleaved in reductive environment of some cancer cells. Besides, since maytansinoids and MMAE are synthetic analogs of their natural product counterparts, sulfhydryl or amine groups can be added during synthesis, making them adaptable to various conjugation chemistry methods. Therefore, the main conjugation sites on antibodies are cysteines (both native and mutated cysteines) and lysines.",

However, it is complicated to map out a perfect ADC that requires optimization of multiple parameters including antigens, antibodies, linkers, payloads, and the payload-linker linkage. The therapeutic targets of the ADCs are expected to express only on the surface of the corresponding target tumor cells. On the contrary, many antigens usually express on normal tissues to some extent, which could disturb the specificity of ADCs and limit their clinical application, not to mention the antibody is also difficult to choose. It requires to not only target and have affinity with the corresponding antigen, but it also needs to have a linkage site with the linker to load the payloads. In addition, the linker and payload are indispensable in the efficacy of ADCs. The linker is required to stabilize the ADC in the circulatory system and is brittle to release free payload while the antibody combines with antigen. Also, it is a premise that the dose of ADCs will not kill normal tissues and the released payloads are able to fulfill the killing potency in tumor cells at the same time. In this review, we mainly focus on the latest development of key factors affecting ADCs progress, including the selection of antibodies and antigens, the optimization of payload, the modification of linker, payload-linker linkage, and some other relevant parameters of ADCs.",

            "text": "The serum stability of the drug linker has been shown to have a significant impact on the off-target toxicity of an ADC (21). The stability of STRO-002 was evaluated by incubating the ADC in PBS, human, and cynomolgus plasma at 100 mg/mL at 37 C for 3 weeks. At different time points after incubation, the stability of the antibody was estimated by an ELISA specific for anti-FolRa antibodies. Antibody levels in human and cynomolgus monkey plasma were stable over time, similar to antibody levels after incubation in PBS (Fig. 3A). To measure the stability of the linker-warhead, STRO-002 in the plasma was captured by beads coated with FolRa ECD, and subject to LC-MS/MS analysis. The relative DAR was calculated using a weighted average of deconvoluted peak areas of DAR0 -DAR4 species. Minimal changes in DAR were observed over 21 days in PBS, human and cynomolgus monkey plasma (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that both antibody and linkerwarhead portions of STRO-002 are stable in human and cynomolgus monkey plasma. \n\nThe in vivo stability of STRO-002 was evaluated in non-tumor bearing SCID Beige mice with a single intravenous dose at 5 mg/kg. The total plasma concentration of STRO-002 antibody was measured over time by a quantitative ELISA specific for human Fc. The pharmacokinetic profile of STRO-002 antibody is similar to other reported antibodies with T 1/2 \u00bc 6.4 days and clearance rate of 9.6 mL/day/kg (Fig. 3C). The linker warhead stability of STRO-002 was evaluated by affinity pull-down of STRO-002 from the mice plasma followed by LC-MS/MS analysis to determine the DAR. As shown in Fig. 3D, STRO-002 drug linkages remained intact in blood circulation with the DAR of STRO-002 remained at 3.9 over 21 days.",

            "text": "8 ADC prepared with the hydrophobic drug-linker val-cit-monomethylauristatin F was taken up by Kupffer cells and hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells, likely contributing to the accelerated plasma clearance in rats (6). This uptake was greatly diminished when using drug-linkers designed to minimize hydrophobicity, and the resulting ADCs exhibited plasma pharmacokinetics similar to that of the unconjugated antibody.\n\nAlthough an effective drug-linker for ADCs (8), drug-linker 1 (Fig. 1) has limitations. The physicochemical properties of the drug-linker limit the optimal drug-loading to approximately 4 drugs per antibody when conjugated as a distribution across four reducible native antibody cysteine disulfides. Early work with drug-linker 1 demonstrated that higher loaded DAR 8 conjugates, while more potent than lower loaded ADCs in vitro, were inferior in vivo due to accelerated plasma clearance (9). In this work, we sought to achieve greater ADC potency and homogeneous DAR 8 conjugates by stably conjugating MMAE via a hydrophilic PEGylated glucuronide linker system. The glucuronide linker system represents a hydrophilic alternative to the val-cit dipeptide, and exploits lysosomal b-glucuronidase (10) to initiate drug release. The glucuronide linker has been used to mitigate aggregation issues with lipophilic payloads like minor groove binders (11) and camptothecins (12). Glucuronide-MMAE linker 2 was found to provide ADCs at 4-drugs/Ab with in vitro and in vivo properties similar to val-cit-MMAE linker 1 conjugates (13). More recently, we have shown that incorporation of a PEG 24 solubilizing moiety in a side chain configuration (drug-linker 3), but not as a tether between the maleimide and drug, enabled ADCs loaded at 8-drugs/Ab with greater plasma exposure and improved in vivo performance relative to non-PEGylated drug-linker 2 controls (6)",

In comparison with cleavable linkers, non-cleavable linkers were found to have improved stability in the bloodstream allowing ADCs with such linkers to have longer half-lives and pose a reduced risk from side effects while retaining the activity of the cytotoxic drug [127]. This knowledge was reflected in the clinical development of T-DM1, originally designed to have a valine-citrulline dipeptide linker but was instead produced with a non-cleavable thioether linker [128]. Despite the successful use of non-cleavable linkers, it is important to note that their dependence on lysosomal degradation means they can only be used in ADCs targeting antigens that undergo efficient intracellular internalization.\n\nOnce an optimal linker for a particular ADC is chosen, it is important to determine the ideal number of drugs to be conjugated to a mAb [i.e., the drug-antibody ratio (DAR)]. Because of potential linker instability and poor ADC internalization, several drugs are required to be linked to each mAb to achieve adequate cytotoxicity. On the other hand, excessive drug conjugation might result in increased clearance and/or immunogenicity as the ADC is more likely to aggregate and be recognized as a damaged, malformed or foreign protein [129]. In a study conducted by Hamblett et al. [130], the in vivo efficacy of ADCs containing four drugs per antibody was found to be equivalent to that of ADCs with eight drugs per mAb. Heavily modified ADCs (i.e., those with eight conjugated drugs) were associated with increased . . toxicity and underwent faster clearance from the circulation. Additionally, it was found that ADCs containing only two drugs per mAb had a much wider therapeutic window and therefore a higher maximum tolerated dose. The study consequently concluded that ADCs loaded with 2-4 drugs per mAb achieved the best balance between slow clearance and maximal potency [130].\n\nA critical aspect of linker function is the presence or absence of a phenomenon known as the by",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) represent an exciting and promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of cancers. The US Food and Drug Administration's recent approval of brentuximab vedotin (Adcetris \u00ae ) in 2011 and trastuzumab emtansine (Kadcyla \u00ae ) in 2013 has brought a proof of the ADC concept in hematologic and solid tumors, respectively. The number of ADCs or immunoconjugates undergoing clinical studies is rapidly increasing, driving much attention to understand the criteria for success. The ADC concept looks quite simple. The basic idea is to conjugate a potent cytotoxic drug to a monoclonal antibody (mAb) selected to target a tumor associated antigen. Both drug components are conjugated by a linker designed to be stable in the blood streamline and to properly release the drug into the targeted cancer cell. Tremendous progress has been made in each area (i.e., antibody, drug, linker, target), but many important parameters must be addressed simultaneously to make a successful ADC product. The aim of Antibody-Drug Conjugates, which was edited by Laurent Ducry (Lonza), 1 is to provide detailed protocols for many of the critical ADC techniques necessary to succeed in the field. Each chapter addresses a specific aspect and is written by scientists who have recognized expertise in the domain. \n\nIn the introductory chapter, Ingrid Sassoon and Veronique Blanc (Sanofi) review the current ADC clinical pipeline, which includes nearly 30 candidates in addition to the two approved products mentioned above. The clinical data for the most advanced clinical candidate, such as CMC-544, SAR3419, CDX-011, PSMA-ADC, BT-062, and IMGN901, are summarized. Notably, a table of discontinued ADCs is also provided and discussed. The current challenges in ADC development are clearly identified. These include the improvement of the therapeutic index, the careful selection of the targets, the better understanding of ADC mechanism of action and the understanding of ADC off-target toxicities. Last but not least, the selection of appropriate clinical settings, including the patient selection and the dosing regimen, is also discussed.",

The former two conjugation methods produce heterogeneous products containing a mixture of different molar ratios of drug (0-8 drugs) to antibody linked at different conjugation sites. 5,6 In contrast, ADCs derived from engineered cysteines (THIOMAB platform) result in homogenous preparation with defined stoichiometry (2 drugs per antibody). 7 He showcased several examples of in vivo efficacy and safety studies on conventional ADCs and their corresponding engineered ADCs in his presentation. Despite having a lower drug load, engineered ADCs with 2 drugs per antibody showed similar in vivo efficacy compared with conventional ADCs with an average of 3.5 drugs per antibody. This was reasoned to be due to improved PK properties of engineered ADCs compared with conventional ADCs.7 Engineered ADCs in the context of a non-cleavable maytansine (MCC-DM1) or a cleavable auristatin-based linker drug (MC-vc-PAB-MMAE) displayed reduced liver and bone marrow toxicity compared with conventional ADCs. 7,8 r. Junutula highlighted the role of the conjugation site in the in vivo stability and therapeutic activity of ADCs. He summarized the data on engineered ADCs using three trastuzumab THIOMAB variants that differed in solvent accessibility and local charge. These three variants had similar in vitro properties (binding to target antigen and in vitro potency), but differed in their in vivo efficacy and PK properties. A detailed biochemical mechanism on the stability of cysteine-maleimide-based antibody conjugates in plasma in vitro and in vivo was dissected and discussed.",

            "text": "Antibody\u2013drug conjugates (ADCs) comprise 3 distinct parts: a specific antibody carrier (mAb), a linker, and a cytotoxic payload. Typical pharmacokinetic (PK) characterization of ADCs remains fragmented using separate noncompartmental analyses (NCA) of individual analytes, offering little insight into the dynamic relationships among the ADC components, and the safety and efficacy implications. As a result, it is exceedingly difficult to compare ADCs in terms of favorable PK characteristics. Therefore, there is a need for characterizing ADCs using the joint disposition properties critical for understanding the fate of an ADC complex and clinical implications. In this communication, we describe 3 joint disposition metrics (JDMs) for integrated NCA of ADCs based on a combination of common analytes of ADC, payload, conjugated payload, and total mAb. These JDMs were derived, each in a simple form of a ratio between appropriate PK parameters of two analytes, from the presumed drug delivery scheme behind typical ADC designs, in terms of (1) linker stability, (2) therapeutic exposure ratio, and (3) effective drug-to-antibody ratio in vivo. The validity of the JDM-based PK characterization was examined against model-based analyses via their applications to 3 clinical candidates: PF-06650808, PF-06647020, and PF-06664178. For instance, the linker stability estimates for PF-06650808, PF-06647020, and PF-06664178 were 0.31, 0.14, and 0.096, respectively, from the JDM-based analyses vs. 0.23, 0.11, and 0.086 by the model-based approach. Additionally, the JDMs were estimated for a number of FDA-approved or otherwise well-documented ADCs, showing their utilities in comparing ADCs in terms of favorable PK characteristics.",

            "text": "The specificity, efficacy, and safety of an ADC are determined by the design, structure, and chemistry of the linker that connects the cytotoxic payload to the antibody. Linkers are typically designed to be constant in the blood system (enabling for a prolonged timeframe of bloodstream), but labile enough to efficiently deliver the cytotoxic payload to the tumour [51]. \n\nCleavable and non-cleavable linkers are the two types of linkers. Following exposure to acidic or reducing environments or proteolytic enzymes, cleavable linkers are cut and release the ADC's cytotoxic payload (for example, Non-cleavable linkers are becoming more appealing than cleavable linkers due to the advantage of greater plasma stability. Furthermore, studies show that noncleavable linkers perform far better in vivo, with payload release occurring primarily in the lysosome following ADC internalisation and destruction of both the antibody and the linker (Fig. 2). As a result, the danger of systemic toxicity from premature payload release is reduced. As a result, non-cleavable linkers may offer a wider therapeutic window, as well as increased stability and tolerability [53]. T-DM1 with mafodotin belantamab is one of two FDA-approved ADCs with non-cleavable linkers [18]. \n\nThe systemic stability of ADCs post administration is one of the crucial issues to ensure the efficacy of ADCs, and several strategic approaches are taken for overcoming this issue. ADCs should ideally remain stable or intact in the circulation before entering target cells, but there are cases where ADC catabolites are still biologically active [54,55]. ADC stability refers primarily to metabolic stability or integrity. To improve ADC stability, several approaches involving conjugation site selection and linker modification have been developed [54]. In general, modifications to each component (e.g., antibody, linker, and payload) can be performed for this purpose. The conjugation site, linker length, and linker steric hindrance are effective general approaches for site-specific ADCs and should be more broadly applicable to a variety of ADC platforms [54].",

            "text": "In recent years, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have become promising antitumor agents to be used as one of the tools in personalized cancer medicine. ADCs are comprised of a drug with cytotoxic activity cross-linked to a monoclonal antibody, targeting antigens expressed at higher levels on tumor cells than on normal cells. By providing a selective targeting mechanism for cytotoxic drugs, ADCs improve the therapeutic index in clinical practice. In this review, the chemistry of ADC linker conjugation together with strategies adopted to improve antibody tolerability (by reducing antigenicity) are examined, with particular attention to ADCs approved by the regulatory agencies (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA)) for treating cancer patients. Recent developments in engineering Immunoglobulin (Ig) genes and antibody humanization have greatly reduced some of the problems of the first generation of ADCs, beset by problems, such as random coupling of the payload and immunogenicity of the antibody. ADC development and clinical use is a fast, evolving area, and will likely prove an important modality for the treatment of cancer in the near future.",

            "text": "Though it is important to select optimal target-specific antibodies and potent payloads based on type of cancer cells, the conjugation and linker chemistries are also crucial components for successful construction of an ADC and the major topics of this review. The linker moiety covalently tethers the antibody and payload components. Its molecular design and properties are critical determinant factors for ADC efficacy in terms of pharmacokinetics (PK)/pharmacodynamics (PD) and therapeutic window. To maximize these parameters, various types of linkers have been developed and evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Several criteria must be met for successful ADC construction. (1) The linker needs to possess sufficient stability in plasma so that ADC molecules can circulate in the bloodstream and localize to the tumor site without premature cleavage. Instability of the linker causes premature liberation of the toxic payload and undesired damage to non-target healthy cells, which can lead to systemic toxicity and adverse effects. However, a clinical study revealed reverse correlation between linker stability of maytansinoid-based ADCs and adverse toxicity (Drake and Rabuka, 2015). Therefore, it is important to identify ADC linkers with optimal linker stability for each combination of antigen, target tumor type, and payload. (2) At the same time, the linker needs to possess the ability to be rapidly cleaved and to release free and toxic payload once the ADC is internalized into the target tumor cell. (3) Another property to be considered in the linker design is hydrophobicity. Hydrophobic linkers coupled with hydrophobic payloads often promote aggregation of ADC molecules. For example, King and co-workers observed non-covalent dimerization of the monoclonal antibody BR96 conjugated with doxorubicin through a multi-loading, hydrophobic dipeptide linker (King et al., 2002). Such molecules are unfavorable in the pursuit of therapeutically useful ADCs; aggregated proteins tend to be rapidly sequestered in the liver and cleared by the reticuloendothelial system, resulting in hepatotoxicity (Finbloom et al., 1980). In addition, aggregated proteins are likely",

            "text": "The efficacy of an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) is dependent on the properties of its linker-payload which must remain stable while in systemic circulation but undergo efficient processing upon internalization into target cells. Here, we examine the stability of a non-cleavable Amino-PEG6-based linker bearing the monomethyl auristatin D (MMAD) payload site-specifically conjugated at multiple positions on an antibody. Enzymatic conjugation with transglutaminase allows us to create a stable amide linkage that remains intact across all tested conjugation sites on the antibody, and provides us with an opportunity to examine the stability of the auristatin payload itself. We report a position-dependent degradation of the C terminus of MMAD in rodent plasma that has a detrimental effect on its potency. The MMAD cleavage can be eliminated by either modifying the C terminus of the toxin, or by selection of conjugation site. Both approaches result in improved stability and potency in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we show that the MMAD metabolism in mouse plasma is likely mediated by a serine-based hydrolase, appears much less pronounced in rat, and was not detected in cynomolgus monkey or human plasma. Clarifying these species differences and controlling toxin degradation to optimize ADC stability in rodents is essential to make the best ADC selection from preclinical models. The data presented here demonstrate that site selection and toxin susceptibility to mouse plasma degradation are important considerations in the design of non-cleavable ADCs, and further highlight the benefits of site-specific conjugation methods.",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are becoming increasingly prominent anticancer therapeutics [1]. Currently, 14 ADCs are marketed worldwide for hematological indications or solid tumor cancers [2], of which 11 have gained regulatory approval since 2017 [3]. In addition, over 100 ADCs are under investigation at various stages of clinical development [1,2]. However, the relatively narrow therapeutic index remains one of the main challenges for ADC development. Therefore, strategies that can mitigate off-target toxicities and/or increase the on-target efficacy of these molecules may improve the therapeutic index of ADCs and increase their probability of clinical success [4]. Efforts to enhance the therapeutic index of ADCs primarily focus on optimizing ADC design and construction (i.e., linker chemistry, conjugation method, payload potency, stability) [5,6]. However, approaches that aim to modulate the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) of ADCs may also have the potential to increase the therapeutic index of ADCs. Given that ADCs comprise large and small molecules, multiple analytes such as the conjugated antibody (mAb), conjugated payload, unconjugated payload, and naked mAb can be measured upon ADC administration [7]. The PK of these analytes in systemic circulation and/or at the site-of-action (i.e., tumor) determine the efficacy and safety of ADCs. Therefore, we hypothesize that switching the routes of administration of ADCs may enable modulation of the PK of individual ADC analytes at the site of efficacy and toxicity, and may provide a viable strategy to modulate the therapeutic index of ADCs. \n\nCurrently, all approved ADCs are administered via the intravenous (IV) route, and the therapeutic potential of ADCs via other routes is rarely investigated. However, when it comes to therapeutic proteins such as monoclonal antibodies, while the IV route is still the most commonly used route, several alternative routes of administration have been proven to be successful in improving the therapeutic index of these molecules [8].",

The objective of this study was to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) and explore exposure\u2013response relationships of eight vc-MMAE ADCs, against different targets and for diverse tumor indications, using data from eight first-in-human Phase 1 studies. PK parameters of the three analytes, namely antibody-conjugated MMAE (acMMAE), total antibody, and unconjugated MMAE, were estimated using non-compartmental approaches and compared across the eight vc-MMAE ADCs. Relationships between analytes were assessed by linear regression. Exposure\u2013response relationships were explored with key efficacy (objective response rate) and safety (Grade 2+ peripheral neuropathy) endpoints. PK profiles of acMMAE, total antibody and unconjugated MMAE following the first dose of 2.4 mg/kg were comparable across the eight ADCs; the exposure differences between molecules were small relative to the inter-subject variability. acMMAE exposure was strongly correlated with total antibody exposure for all the eight ADCs, but such correlation was less evident between acMMAE and unconjugated MMAE exposure. For multiple ADCs evaluated, efficacy and safety endpoints appeared to correlate well with acMMAE exposure, but not with unconjugated MMAE over the doses tested. PK of vc-MMAE ADCs was well characterized and demonstrated remarkable similarity at 2.4 mg/kg across the eight ADCs. Results from analyte correlation and exposure\u2013response relationship analyses suggest that measurement of acMMAE analyte alone might be adequate for vc-MMAE ADCs to support the clinical pharmacology strategy used during late-stage clinical development.",

            "text": "Therefore, endothelial cells may represent the Achilles' heel of solid tumors that may be exploited by ADC compounds targeting tumor vasculature. \n\nA number of questions related to identifying suitable antibodies during early stages of development were raised, and there was general agreement of a lack of surrogate measurements that strongly correlated with the ultimate activity of a given ADC in the clinic. The panel recommended that antibody affinities, internalization rates, antigen copy numbers and other parameters of the unmodified mAbs alone have failed to predict potent activity as an ADC. However, improvements in culture conditions of human tumor cells, including three-dimensional matrixes, may improve the tissue architecture and morphology, and the predictive value of in vitro experiments. Dr. Benjamin indicated that direct screening of primary ADCs was the most effective way to identify promising antibodies for ADC therapy. Ultimately, the best data for lead selection may be derived from experiments in animals, combining safety and efficacy endpoints to determine the therapeutic index. A related topic was the interdependence of pharmacokinetics and linker stability. The panel agreed that slow clearance of an ADC was desirable, and that linker strategies need to take advantage of the long serum half lives. Previous linkers with half lives of 1-2 days were seen to be inadequate and the current linkers with half lives of 1-2 weeks provided superior therapeutic indices. The panelists agreed that further improvements in linker stability yielded diminishing returns and the focus for future work on linker technology would be on aspects other than stability. Robert Lutz (Immunogen) and Hans-Peter Gerber (Wyeth) agreed on the current scarcity of drugs that can be successfully conjugated to antibodies and related their experience in searching for novel compounds. In general, highly potent small molecules are required because antibody-mediated delivery of drug is an inefficient process, and the drug must be able to exert cytotoxic effects at relatively low intracellular concentrations. That being said, extreme potency has also resulted in antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) that demonstrated increased toxicity; the difficulty in finding the right balance between these contrasting requirements was identified as a major obstacle to finding new chemo types.",

This notably includes their physical characteristics (e.g., composition and size, surface engineering, DAR, conjugation site, and net charge at physiological pH) and their propensity to generate antidrug antibodies (ADAs), the latter correlating with ADCs immunogenicity. All those factors have been recently reviewed [33,34] and are not covered by the present review. In any event and due to their multicomponent nature, ADCs must be considered as a complex and dynamically changing mixture in vivo, driven by undesirable drug release [35], catabolism [36], and variable clearance rate according to DAR [37]. Therefore, in such a scenario, multiple ADCs-derived analytes have to be measured to properly describe the stability and biodistribution of ADCs as well as the amount of drug accumulated within the targeted tissues.",

Its design is essential for achieving targeted delivery and maximizing therapeutic efficacy. An ideal linker should remain stable in systemic circulation to ensure that ADCs maintain a stable connection between the antibody and payload during systemic circulation, thereby minimizing premature drug release and reducing off-target toxicity. Upon entry into tumor cells, the linker should facilitate efficient and timely release of the payload, ensuring that cytotoxic effects are confined to the tumor microenvironment. Linkers with appropriate hydrophilic/lipophilic properties can bind to the characteristics of effective payloads and mitigate immune responses. Hydrophobic linkers coupled with hydrophobic payloads often promote the aggregation of ADC molecules. Aggregated ADCs may act as immunogenic substances, potentially triggering undesired immune responses during circulation in the bloodstream [119]. Additionally, the linker must not induce ADC aggregation, as this could impair antibody functionality, decrease stability, and affect pharmacokinetics [120]. Linkers are generally categorized into two main types: cleavable and non-cleavable linkers (Fig. 5).",

For instance, ADCs bearing anti-mitotic drugs have demonstrated increased therapeutic efficacy. 4 Nonetheless, developing successful ADCs requires many considerations including antigen target, antibody, linker design, and payload. 5\u22129 Additionally, conjugation strategies, which dictate factors such as drug loading and stability, can greatly influence therapeutic outcomes.

            "text": "Antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) are an increasingly important therapeutic modality for the treatment of cancer. The attachment of a cytotoxic agent to an antibody against antigenpresenting cancer cells is a proven formula that has yielded the approval of 10 drugs with many more promising candidates in clinical development. 1,2 This strategy of targeted delivery of potent, apoptotic agents such a tubulin binders, DNA-damaging molecules, spliceosome inhibitors, and RNA polymerase inhibitors typically offers larger therapeutic windows over traditional chemotherapy due to reduced toxicity towards healthy cells. 3 To further expand on the success of this platform, a variety of strategies have been employed to improve the therapeutic index of ADCs. For one, improvements in antigen selection and discovery are important in order to successfully target cancer cells over healthy tissue. Considerations such as antigen overexpression, cell surface availability, and internalization pathways are considered when engineering antibodies for more effective ADCs. 2,4 In addition to these antigen discovery and antibody engineering efforts, new conjugation and linker chemistries are explored for next-generation ADCs to further improve the therapeutic indices of the modality. One method that has been pursued to reduce the minimum effective dose of these drugs is to increase the drug to antibody ratio (DAR) of the \ue103nal conjugate. In theory, higher drug loadings would allow for increased delivery of cytotoxics, being especially effective in cancer cells with lower antigen presentation or when using lower potency payloads. 5 However, it has been demonstrated that while higher DAR ADCs do o\ue09den show increased potency in vitro, they o\ue09den show lower tolerability and have poorer pharmacokinetic outcomes. 6,7 This observed discrepancy is thought to be the result of rapid, immune-mediated clearance of the more hydrophobic, highly-loaded conjugates. In addition to poor in vivo performance, highly loaded ADCs can suffer from decreased stability as the hydrophobic payloads can cause aggregation and precipitation. 8 While previous attempts to mitigate these challenges have focused on targeting DARs between 2-4, new polymeric linkers have the potential to both provide increased DARs while masking the hydrophobicity of payloads. 9 Hydrophilic polymers can confer signi\ue103cant advantages over traditional ADC linkers",

However, with the Pt(II) linker, we observe that the heavy chain and light chain of all the ADCs, whether with the whole antibody or with the Fab fragment, do not separate on the gel and the majority of the ADC appears as a single band corresponding to the intact molecular weight ( Fig. 5; Lane 3 vs. Lane 4). The bands in the ADC lanes ( Fig. 5; Lane 3 and Lane 4) show \ue104uorescence when the gel is viewed under UV light, ensuring that the CPT remains conjugated to the antibody on the gel. This data suggests the presence of strong interactions between the antibody chains in Pt(II)-ADC unlike in maleimide-ADC thereby preserving the higher order structural stability. Encouraged by the stability of the Pt-based ADC in the presence of albumin and its conserved higher order structure, we next assessed its stability in the presence of human and mouse plasma. Instability of the linker technology during circulation in the blood stream would result in the premature release of the drug, leading to dose-limiting side effects. Ctx-Pt-PEG-CPT and Tra-Pt-PEG-CPT were incubated in human and mouse plasma at 37 C and samples were withdrawn at various time-points. Extracted camptothecin species from the samples were analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC (RP-HPLC) using a \ue104uorescence detector and the platinum content in the samples was measured by Pt-AAS. The stability of Ctx-Pt-PEG-CPT and Tra-Pt-PEG-CPT in human plasma was demonstrated by an extended half-life of 94 h and 133 h, respectively, in vitro ( Fig. 6a and c) which is a signi\ue103cant improvement when compared with IMMU-132, a maleimide-based ADC with SN-38 (camptothecin derivative) in clinical trials, having a half",

Two compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis of single site specific ADCs suggested that clearance (CL) of the trastuzumab CF with nnAA incorporated at different sites was comparable across several sites, namely HC S136, R355, F404 and LC site S7. HC N389 showed faster clearance demonstrating that conjugation site affects PK (Fig. 4c). In general, the different linkers AB4285 and AB3627 did not affect the PK profiles of the antibody. \n\nTo assess the plasma stability of the linkers, samples from the PK study were analyzed using a bead-based affinity capture and LC/MS (Fig. 4d). We first evaluated the in vivo stability of the AB3627 drug-linker that was conjugated to sites HC-S136 and HC F404. AB3627 conjugated to HC site S136 show significant loss of drug on day 7 in Balb/c mouse (Fig. S2). S136 conjugated to AB4285, which is a methylated derivative of AB3627, shows improved stability in Beige nude XID mouse. Similarly, AB4285 conjugated to trastuzumab CF at HC site R355, F404 and LC site S7 show high drug-linker stability in circulation up to day 21. A modest decline in stability was observed for AB4285 conjugated to HC site N389. Remarkably, AB3627 conjugated to HC F404 shows stability up to day 21, suggesting that local environment around F404 protects this otherwise labile linker from degradation in vivo. \n\nTo determine in vivo efficacy, the same site-specific ADCs were evaluated in a KPL-4 orthotopic animal model 2,22 .

            "text": "Plasma samples were analyzed for total circulating trastuzumab CF antibody concentrations using anti-Her2 ELISA. Two compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis of single site specific ADCs suggested that clearance (CL) of the trastuzumab CF with nnAA incorporated at different sites was comparable across several sites, namely HC S136, R355, F404 and LC site S7. HC N389 showed faster clearance demonstrating that conjugation site affects PK (Fig. 4c). In general, the different linkers AB4285 and AB3627 did not affect the PK profiles of the antibody. \n\nTo assess the plasma stability of the linkers, samples from the PK study were analyzed using a bead-based affinity capture and LC/MS (Fig. 4d). We first evaluated the in vivo stability of the AB3627 drug-linker that was conjugated to sites HC-S136 and HC F404. AB3627 conjugated to HC site S136 show significant loss of drug on day 7 in Balb/c mouse (Fig. S2). S136 conjugated to AB4285, which is a methylated derivative of AB3627, shows improved stability in Beige nude XID mouse. Similarly, AB4285 conjugated to trastuzumab CF at HC site R355, F404 and LC site S7 show high drug-linker stability in circulation up to day 21. A modest decline in stability was observed for AB4285 conjugated to HC site N389. Remarkably, AB3627 conjugated to HC F404 shows stability up to day 21, suggesting that local environment around F404 protects this otherwise labile linker from degradation in vivo. \n\nTo determine in vivo efficacy, the same site-specific ADCs were evaluated in a KPL-4 orthotopic animal model 2,22 .

            "text": "hese drugs are so potent that they cannot be used as standalone therapeutics, causing more toxicity than therapeutic gain. In order to use these ultratoxic drugs in ADCs, new chemistries were required, including specialized linkers, with the primary goal to sustain the bond between the antibody and the drug while the conjugate was in the circulation, but enabling release of the active drug when the conjugate was internalized by, or released on or adjacent to, the target cells (e.g., when trafficked to the lysosome). Thus, while bound to the antibody-linker, the drug should be inactive, but once released within or in the immediate environment of the tumor cell, it should effectively kill at relatively low concentrations due to its extreme potency. This resulted in ultratoxic ADCs that had relatively low ratios of drug to antibody (<4) and low dosing in order to control offtarget toxicity. 5,10,11 DCs that incorporate ultratoxic drugs require a high level of stability between the antibody-drug bond when in the blood, with activity only possible if the conjugate is internalized by the tumor cell. This places a specific requirement on the target, i.e., the antigen must be on the surface of the tumor cells, in high concentration, and accessible, and a high level of tumor specificity is needed in order to preclude off-target toxicities. The antigen-antibody must be internalized, and in some cases, the conjugate needs to be trafficked selectively to sites within the cells that will enable the cleavage of the linkerdrug bond. While the advent of stably linked ultratoxic agents conjugated to relatively cancer-specific human or humanized monoclonal antibodies led to the approval of several ADCs, 12 the testing of new ADCs has shown that success is not guaranteed based solely on the use of any one conjugate platform or drug. Other factors, such as the selection and level of tumor expression of the target, target antigen biosynthesis and heterogeneity during the course of therapy, tumor progression (all influencing therapeutic resistance), and specific properties of the cancer type and stage also play important roles.",

Alternatively, when two bioactive small molecules are joined without a linker, fused multi-targeting ligands are obtained. These can be either cleavable or uncleavable, depending on the nature of the employed bond.

Schematic representation of antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) approach for cancer therapy. An ADC comprises three key components: 1) the antibody (Ab) targeting a specific cell; 2) the linker; 3) the cytotoxic drug. They work synergistically to enable precise delivery of the cytotoxic agent to the target cell. ADCs are engineered to stay stable in the bloodstream and release the drug inside cells after binding to a specific antigen. The antibody needs to exhibit high binding affinity to the specific target antigen, low immunogenicity, stability in the bloodstream, and minimal cross-reactivity. The linker connects the antibody to the cytotoxic payload via covalent conjugation, ensuring stability in the bloodstream and enabling quick release of the drug at the target site. Successful ADC development also relies on the drug-antibody ratio (DAR), which quantifies the number of drug molecules attached to the antibody via the linker.",

            "text": "The linked drug should be capable of efficient cell killing. Usually, payloads present higher toxicity than other chemotherapeutic agents (from 100-to 1000-fold). Importantly, the potency of the cytotoxic payload should be directed by conjugating it to a tumor-specific antibody. Each component can influence the final efficacy and safety of an ADC. ADC development must carefully consider each of these elements, including the selection of the target antigen, antibody, cytotoxic payload, linker, and conjugation methods [1,[22][23][24][25][26][27]. Current ADCs have advanced in engineering the antibody, predominantly using conventional immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies, which possess a high affinity that enables effective internalization while preserving plasma half-life. Improvements have also been made in the linker, conjugation site, small-molecule payload, and the average number of drug molecules linked to each antibody or drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR). However, the relationship between the heterogeneous intratumoral distribution and the efficacy of ADCs is still poorly understood [6,[22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31].",

ADCs are formed by an antibody against a specific tumor-associated antigen (TAA), a cytotoxic payload, and a chemical linker that binds both. To this regard, most efforts have been focused on target identification, antibody design and linker optimization, but other relevant aspects for clinical development have not received the necessary attention. In this article using data from approved ADCs, we evaluated all characteristics of these agents, including payload physicochemical properties, in vitro potency, drug antibody ratio (DAR), exposure\u2013response relationships, and clinical development strategies. We suggest that compounds with best options for clinical development include those with optimal payload physicochemical properties and cleavable linkers that would lead to a bystander effect. These modalities can facilitate the development of ADCs in indications with low expression of the TAA. Early clinical development strategies including changes in the schedule of administration with more frequent doses are also discussed in the context of an efficient strategy. In conclusion, we highlight relevant aspects that are needed for the optimal development of ADCs in cancer, proposing options for improvement.",

The design of clinically effective antibody\u2013drug conjugates (ADCs), in which biologically active drugs are coupled through chemical linkers to monoclonal antibodies, has presented challenges for pharmaceutical researchers. After 30 years of intensive research and development activities, only seven ADCs have been approved for clinical use; two have received fast-track designation and two breakthrough therapy designation from the Food and Drug Administration. There is continued interest in the field, as documented by the growing number of candidates in clinical development. This review aims to summarize the most recent innovations that have been applied to the design of ADCs undergoing early- and late-stage clinical trials. Discovery and rational optimization of new payloads, chemical linkers, and antibody formats have improved the therapeutic index of next-generation ADCs, ultimately resulting in improved clinical benefit for the patients.",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), cytotoxic drugs linked to antibodies through specialized chemical linkers, provide a method to target cytotoxic drugs to a tumor and minimize normal tissue damage, thereby increasing the effectiveness and reducing the toxicity of chemotherapy. The design of an ideal ADC is a dichotomy requiring tight linkage between the cytotoxic drug and the antibody to prevent nonspecific drug release while the agent is in circulation, yet appropriate release of the drug when the ADC reaches the tumor. The specific release of the cytotoxic drug is critical to the safety of the ADCs because the cytotoxic drug must be hundreds-fold more potent than the drugs used in typical systemic chemotherapy to be effective in the context of an ADC (1)(2)(3). To accomplish this specificity, specialized linkers between the antibody and drug have been designed that are cleaved only in a specific microenvironment found in or on the target tumor cell. Examples include linkers that are cleaved by acidic conditions, reducing conditions, or proteases (4)(5)(6). Another option is to have stable linkers that are not cleaved, but rather, coupled to antibodies against tumor antigens that are internalized and then degraded, releasing the drug attached to the conjugating amino acid within cells (7,8). Thus, the active metabolite(s) and amounts of active drug released should be substantially different for the cleavable linker ADC and this could affect the safety and efficacy of the ADCs.\n\nAnother factor that has been less explored is the interaction of the linker type and the target. In vitro data suggest that the biology of the target, in particular, the extent of trafficking to the lysosomal compartment, will influence the effectiveness of the ADC (7)(8)(9)(10). In vivo, the situation is even more complex; the extracellular microenvironment, and the intracellular trafficking of the target, the longer exposure times (weeks instead of days), in combination with the linker-drug used, will determine where, to what extent, and in what form the cytotoxic drug is released and",

            "text": "6][7][8] Three components are required to make an ADC: the antibody, a cytotoxic drug (i.e., the payload) and a linker that holds the antibody and small molecule drug together. The linker and drug are typically combined into a final small molecule intermediate termed the linker drug, which is then conjugated to the antibody. The linker portion should have sufficient stability to enable the ADCs to circulate in the bloodstream before reaching the tumor site without prematurely releasing the free drug and potentially damaging normal cells. Once the ADC is internalized within the target cell, the linker should be sufficiently labile to allow efficient release of the active free drug. 9 urrently, the physicochemical characterization of ADCs is primarily focused on the assessment of the antibody. For example, size-exclusion chromatography can be used to determine the presence of size variants and charge variants can be observed via imaged capillary isoelectric focusing or ion exchange chromatography. 10,11 As ADCs also carry small molecule drugs, specialized analytical assays must be used to determine attributes such as drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR), 12,13 drug distribution, 12,13 content of unconjugated free drug, 14 and content of residual conjugation solvent. 15 owever, the small molecule drug (typical MW 500-1500 Da) accounts for only about 1% of the ADC molecule (average MW 150 kDa) by weight, and there are no assays currently available that can directly characterize the small molecule drug component of ADCs. The purity of the small molecule drug and linker components of ADCs are critical quality attributes. Low impurity levels must be maintained because impurities can potentially introduce new toxicities that affect patient safety or they can be sub-potent, leading to a decrease in efficacy. \n\nIt is also important to monitor the stability of the active drug linked to the ADC because it may degrade during storage, particularly in liquid formulations. In the past, however, it has been possible to detect only impurities that formed and were released from the antibody. 14",

            "text": "Arming monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with small-molecule drugs enables targeted delivery of a biologically active payload to specific cells expressing target antigen. Antibody\u2212drug conjugates (ADCs) have emerged as a powerful therapeutic modality to specifically eradicate target tumor cells by directing the highly potent cytotoxic drugs to the cells that express specific antigens on their surface. Furthermore, the ADC field is growing beyond oncology therapeutics. For instance, antibody\u2212antibiotic conjugates, which consist of an anti-microbial antibody and a highly efficacious antibiotic, have been developed to treat bacterial infections. 1 ADCs have also been utilized to deliver antigens, adjuvants, or innate agonists to the tumor microenvironment or to antigen-presenting cells to boost immune response specific to malignancies. 2,3 To date, a total of twelve ADCs have been approved by the FDA and the indications include various hematological malignancies as well as solid tumors. Although ADCs have great potential to make a paradigm shift in targeted therapy, designing an ideal ADC is complex, as attaching a hydrophobic payload can lead to structural destabilization and enhanced propensity to aggregate. 4 Generally, coupling the drug to the antibody results in a decrease in melting point, and the negative impact on thermal stability is intensified with increased drug loading and hydrophobicity of payload. 5 In addition to thermodynamic properties, metabolic and chemical stability of the payload and specific cleavability of the linker also need to be considered. The payload should be stable during storage and circulation in the blood and also efficient release of free payload is required at targeted sites. The stability of payload is highly dependent on the conjugation site that has diverse electrostatic and/or steric environments. In this work, we evaluated thermodynamic properties and plasma stability of site-specific ADCs bearing the linker-payload in close proximity to the CH2 C'E loop Asn297 undergoing N-glycosylation, which plays a critical role in thermal stability of antibody therapeutics. \n\nTo our surprise, an improvement in the melting temperature was observed by introducing a tubulysin payload to aglycosylated antibodies.",

            "text": "The linker plays a major role in ADC design since it strongly impacts on the safety, potency and activity of the ADC. Most importantly, the linker is expected to remain stable in circulation to avoid premature detachment of the drug while allowing its release within the targeted cell. Two categories of linkers have been developed and can be distinguished based on their cleavability. Cleavable linkers are either sensitive to pH for hydrazone linkers, to glutathione or disulfide isomerase for disulfide linkers and to proteases such as cathepsin B for dipeptide bonds. Non-cleavable linkers rely on lysosomal degradation of the antibody moiety, thereby conserving at least one amino acid, most commonly lysine or cysteine, attached to the payload-linker complex. This approach improves the linkage stability since antibody digestion is required for payload release. While it is emphasized that the more stable the linker is, the less off-target toxicity it triggers, these technologies were often found to be too stringent to support anti-tumoral activity. Safety of ADCs remains a major challenge in their design and ontarget in addition to off-target toxicity is not only driven by the instability of the linker-payload. On-target toxicity is rather always driven by the mAb and its affinity/avidity to the target, together with the payloads' mechanism of action, again illustrating how important the match between tumor type, target antigen and ADC construction is recent interest in linker design improvement has led to the development of hydrophilic linkers to balance payload hydrophobicity [26][27][28][29]. Sulfonate, polyethylene glycol (PEG), polysarcosine (PSAR) or more recently DNA-based linkers have significantly improved ADC stability and pharmacokinetics, leading to less toxic and more active ADCs [30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37].",

Analogously, the two ADCs having 4 and 7 drugs per antibody, respectively, were diluted with PBS (1 mg/mL, pH 7.4) and incubated at 37 \u2022 C in a shaking incubator.All of the samples were analyzed by HIC HPLC.As shown in Figure 4B, none of the four ADCs had significant drug off-targets in this test, and VA-and VC-based ADCs that having four payloads decreased stability by 1.58% and 1.34%, respectively, after seven days, whereas those that having seven payloads decreased stability by 2.52% and 3.88%, respectively, under the same test conditions.In short, ADCs with VA-and VC-based linker systems have substantially comparable in vitro stability in PBS.\n\nInt.

Dr Strop also showed that the process is scalable, cleavable and non-cleavable linkers are compatible with TG conjugation, and that diverse cytotoxic compounds can be conjugated. \n\nTwo selected sites (one at the C-terminus of heavy chain, the second in the light chain) were conjugated with AcLys-VC-MMAD and compared with a mc-VC-MMAD conventional conjugate. The efficacy of the site-specific conjugates against the M1S1 target [drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) 2)] was comparable to the conventional conjugate (DAR4) in the BxPC3 mouse xenograft model; however, the site-specific conjugates were better tolerated. 5 In the second part of the talk, Dr Strop showed data comparing the two site-specific conjugates in terms of stability and PK. Data was presented showing that the site of conjugation can have an effect on the drug-linker stability. While no changes were observed in the TG linkage during the in vitro and in vivo stability studies, the ValCit cleavage element appeared to be cleaved in circulation to some extent in the heavy chain conjugate. These findings appeared to be species-dependent, and the differences between the two sites were more pronounced in rats. \n\nThe total antibody distribution was also changed based on the site of conjugation. The light chain conjugate showed comparable PK to wild type antibody, while the heavy chain conjugate had faster distribution phase. These findings were also species-dependent and were more pronounced in rats. Dr Strop concluded that the site of conjugation, linker-payload, and the combination of the two all can modify properties of ADCs. \n\nDavid Jackson (Igenica) discussed site-specific technology that bridges native cysteines in antibodies. The technology utilizes reduction followed by incubation with the bridging moiety.",

            "text": "Chemotherapy is one of the major therapeutic options for cancer treatment. Chemotherapy is often associated with a low therapeutic window due to its poor specificity towards tumor cells/tissues. Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) technology may provide a potentially new therapeutic solution for cancer treatment. ADC technology uses an antibody-mediated delivery of cytotoxic drugs to the tumors in a targeted manner, while sparing normal cells. Such a targeted approach can improve the tumor-to-normal tissue selectivity and specificity in chemotherapy. Considering its importance in cancer treatment, we aim to review recent efforts for the design and development of ADCs. ADCs are mainly composed of an antibody, a cytotoxic payload, and a linker, which can offer selectivity against tumors, anti-cancer activity, and stability in systemic circulation. Therefore, we have reviewed recent updates and principal considerations behind ADC designs, which are not only based on the identification of target antigen, cytotoxic drug, and linker, but also on the drug-linker chemistry and conjugation site at the antibody. Our review focuses on site-specific conjugation methods for producing homogenous ADCs with constant drug-antibody ratio (DAR) in order to tackle several drawbacks that exists in conventional conjugation methods.",

Since it maintains the https://doi.org/10.4143/crt.2024.714 pISSN 1598-2998, eISSN 2005-9256 Antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) are a novel class of therapeutics that structurally are composed by an antibody directed to a tumor epitope connected via a linker to a cytotoxic payload, and that have shown significant antitumor activity across a range of malignancies including lung cancer. In this article we review the pharmacology and design of ADCs, as well as we describe the results of different studies evaluating ADCs in lung cancer directed to several targets including HER2, HER3, TROP2, MET, CEACAM5 and DLL3. \n\nADCs stability within the bloodstream, in plays a double role in both the toxicity and the activity profile of ADCs. Linker instability in this setting can lead to inappropriate or premature release of the cytotoxic payload and, in consequence, considerable toxicity. Conversely, an effective linker must also successfully release the cytotoxic payload once the ADC is internalized by the targeted cell; instead, the clinical activity of the ADC can be rather diminished [10]. \n\nLinkers are categorized into cleavable or non-cleavable according to their mechanism of payload release [11]: cleavable linkers degrade and release the cytotoxic payload on the basis of certain intracellular factors, such as acidity, glutathione reduction or the presence of lysosomal proteases leading to peptide cleavage [12,13]; on the other side, noncleavable linkers are formed by non-reducible bonds with the antibody amino-acid residues, leading to higher stability within the systemic circulation, and they release the payload through lysosomal-dependent degradation of the entire antibody-linker complex [14].",

The IgG-based ADC was again more stable in a side-by-side comparison of IgG vs. SIP using the F8 antibody and DM1 payload conjugated at a DAR2 as a C-terminal disulphide [35]. As expected, the SIP-drug conjugate accumulated into the tumour and cleared more rapidly and the 24-h uptake levels were more than four times higher for the IgG ADC. Although the payload on the ADC was \u223c10\u00d7 more stable, the SIP conjugate was more effective on a molar basis with authors attributing this to the faster payload release leading to higher tumour payload exposure over a shorter period of time compared with the slow-release of an ADC. Toxicity, which may be higher for a less stable drug-conjugate, was not evaluated [37]. A similarly configured scFv-Fc format ADC was made from an anti-fibroblast growth factor receptor-2 (FGFR2) antibody discovered by phage display. Using the vc-MMAE payload \u223cnM potency was seen [39]. \n\nThe most comprehensive analysis of a potent antibody FDC was described by Seattle Genetics [38] using an anti-CD30 diabody with four cysteine thiols conjugated to MMAE and mono-methyl auristatin F (MMAF) payloads with maleimide linkers. The diabody ADC (MMAF DAR \u223c 4) was compared with an equivalent IgG ADC. In this example, the two formats had comparable DARs and valency. The diabody-drug conjugate had a faster blood clearance reflected by its smaller size, but the 30\u00d7 lower exposure level only led to a 3\u00d7 drop in in vivo efficacy (7.2 vs. 2 mg/kg needed for comparable tumour growth inhibition).",

Significant efforts have been made in designing and choosing suitable linkers for conjugating monoclonal antibodies and cytotoxic drugs. Those linkers can influence the stability, toxicity, PK properties, and pharmacodynamics of ADCs. Each linker has its advantages and disadvantages, and many factors must be considered when they are selected and applied for determinate monoclonal antibodies and specific cytotoxic drugs. The appropriate linker must consider the existing groups presented in the monoclonal antibody, the reactive groups in the cytotoxic drugs, as well as the derivative functional groups. The perfect linker can guarantee sufficient stability of cytotoxic drugs during circulation in the blood stream, effectively prevent premature drug release, efficiently facilitate the liberation of the cytotoxic drug at the target tumor cells, and vigorously promote the efficacy and tolerability of successful ADCs.",

            "text": "ADCs undergo biotransformation in the systemic circulation and in tissue cells. Linker deconjugation/cleavage, linker immolation and payload metabolism are considered typical major biotransformation pathways (Supplementary Figure S1) besides antibody metabolism and catabolism. From the administration of ADCs into the circulation to the action of released payloads in target cells, diverse catabolites can be generated through biotransformation, ranging from large molecules to small molecules, that are either pharmacologically active or inactive. Ideally, ADCs are desired to stay stable or intact in the circulation prior to entering target cells whereas there are situations where ADC catabolites are still biologically active (Su et al., 2018;Poreba, 2020). In most cases, the metabolic stability reflects the intact ADC level given the similar antibody PK parameters such as clearance, distribution volume and half-life mostly across different linker-drug variants. Therefore, ADC stability is herein primarily refers to the metabolic stability or integrity. A number of approaches involving conjugation site selection and linker modification have been developed to enhance ADC stability (Pillow et al., 2017;Sadowsky et al., 2017;Anami et al., 2018;Su et al., 2018). Generally, modifications can be performed on each component (e.g., antibody, linker, and payload) for such purpose. Our investigation has revealed that conjugation site, linker length, and linker steric hindrance are effective general approaches for site-specific THIOMAB TM ADCs (TDCs) (Figure 1A) and should be more broadly applicable to a variety of ADC platforms (Su et al., 2018). The desired steric shield provided by the antibody can be achieved by selecting a more sterically hindered conjugation or attachment site. On the other hand, an alternative chemical modification to introduce proximal steric hindrance around the cleavable or labile site of the linker has been demonstrated to be an effective method of improving stability (Erickson et al., 2006;Pillow et al., 2017;Sadowsky et al., 2017;Anami et al., 2018) and references therein.",

Our study revealed that introduction of small-molecule drugs into an aglycosylated antibody can compensate for thermal destabilization originating from structural distortions caused by elimination of N-linked glycans.

Among these properties, linkers should possess two crucial characteristics, including stability in plasma for an extended period of time so that the ADCs can reach and localize to the cancer cell in the original formation. After internalization, the linkers play a role as a trigger for releasing the cytotoxic drugs when the ADCs face particular circumstances in the cancer cells, and the released cytotoxic drugs could bind to their targets [37]. With the particular microenvironment of tumor cells and the delivery mechanism selected, the active formation of the cytotoxic drug may be efficiently released from ADCs by fracturing the designed linkers inside the target cells [38]. The stability and rupturing capacity of linkers affect the overall pharmacokinetics (PK) properties, toxicities and therapeutic indexes of ADCs [39]. The earlier ADCs, such as BR96-DOX and Mylotarg@, did not have a sufficient therapeutic index and had been withdrawn from the market, which was attributed to the poor stability of linkers [4,40]. Antibodies that selectively bind to the tumor cells and show little cross-reactivity with healthy tissues can be conjugated to the specific cytotoxic drugs through different linkers [30,31]. Antibodies with a preferential role in ADCs must have the following characteristics: special targeting ability to deliver cytotoxic drugs to the tumor cells, high affinity binding to tumor cell-surface antigens and the ability to induce the cells' endocytosis, low immunogenicity and the appropriate linkage sites which would not impact the affinity, endocytosis or efficacy of cytotoxic drugs [32]. However, recently, one report indicated low binding affinity to antibodies may allow for effective penetration to solid tumors [33].",

            "text": "An example is the light-sensitivity in a model ADC using trastuzumab whereas trastuzumab itself does not show such sensitivity [179]. While much is known in the literature regarding the chemical stability of monoclonal antibodies [180] and the data on commonly used cytotoxic linker-payloads is accumulating [153,181,182], novel and non-toxic linker-payloads including siRNA will require a clear understanding of their degradation pathways in order to form control strategies during drug development process, similar to what has been demonstrated on payload metabolism [183]. Therefore, a comprehensive evaluation of the combined system will always be necessary for novel ADCs. \n\nAll the current ADC drugs on the market are lyophilized products suitable for intravenous administration. Such a freeze-dried state protects the ADCs from chemical degradation and aggregation which occur under long-term solution storage conditions. Although interest has been growing for liquid formulation based on the increased experience with ADCs and the improved solubility and stability of the new generation of ADCs, few such feasibility studies have been reported in the literature to date. It can be particularly challenging to prevent payloads from falling off the antibody over a long period of time in solution. In addition, the currently approved ADC drugs are reconstituted to 0.25-20 mg/mL in solution, significantly below the concentrations for most therapeutic antibody products. While the above is a viable approach for intravenous administration commonly used for oncology therapies, the emerging non-oncology application of the ADCs will likely demand stable liquid formulation and subcutaneous administration as commonly expected for many antibody drugs to increase convenience for patients. This growing trend exerts pressure on linker-payload design and conjugation methods in addition to the properties of the parental antibodies, as well as on formulation and device development. The current pre-clinical data for non-oncology ADCs suggest that the ADC doses might not be significantly lower than those for antibodies [41,45,47,52]. The clinical efficacy and therapeutic index of the non-oncology ADCs will ultimately determine the dose requirement and the appropriate drug product concentration.",

            "text": "The emergence of antibody\u2013drug conjugates (ADC), such as brentuximab vedotin and ado-trastuzumab emtansine, has led to increased efforts to identify new payloads and develop improved drug-linker technologies. Most antibody payloads impart significant hydrophobicity to the ADC, resulting in accelerated plasma clearance and suboptimal in vivo activity, particularly for conjugates with high drug-to-antibody ratios (DAR). We recently reported on the incorporation of a discrete PEG24 polymer as a side chain in a \u03b2-glucuronidase-cleavable monomethylauristatin E (MMAE) linker to provide homogeneous DAR 8 conjugates with decreased plasma clearance and increased antitumor activity in xenograft models relative to a non-PEGylated control. In this work, we optimized the drug-linker by minimizing the size of the PEG side chain and incorporating a self-stabilizing maleimide to prevent payload de-conjugation in vivo. Multiple PEG-glucuronide-MMAE linkers were prepared with PEG size up to 24 ethylene oxide units, and homogeneous DAR 8 ADCs were evaluated. A clear relationship was observed between PEG length and conjugate pharmacology when tested in vivo. Longer PEG chains resulted in slower clearance, with a threshold length of PEG8 beyond which clearance was not impacted. Conjugates bearing PEG of sufficient length to minimize plasma clearance provided a wider therapeutic window relative to faster clearing conjugates bearing shorter PEGs. A lead PEGylated glucuronide-MMAE linker was identified incorporating a self-stabilizing maleimide and a PEG12 side chain emerged from these efforts, enabling highly potent, homogeneous DAR 8 conjugates and is under consideration for future ADC programs.

            "text": "The linker, which is the highlight of this review, needs to possess a number of key attributes, including the requirement to be stable in plasma after drug administration for an extended period of time such that the ADC can localize to tumor cells. This stability prevents the premature release of the cytotoxic payload, which would indiscriminately damage tissue of all kinds, thereby lowering the therapeutic index of the ADC. Upon internalization, the ADC should liberate the payload such that the payload can bind to its target. In addition to these two basic functions, linkers can have a profound effect on the physico-chemical properties of the ADC. In particular, most of the cytotoxic payloads are hydrophobic in nature. Thus, linking them to the mAb with an additional hydrophobic moiety can create problems due to aggregation. ADC Current ADC Linker Chemistry aggregates are insoluble and often limit achievable drug loading onto the antibody. It has been conjectured that ADC aggregates are sequestered in the liver, leading to hepatotoxicity (8). Lastly, protein aggregation of biologics, in general, has been linked to increased immunogenicity (9). Due to these safety concerns, aggregation needs to be monitored over time in ADC products to establish a safe shelf-life. In addition to aggregation problems, the hydrophobic characteristic of the majority of cytotoxic compounds in ADCs causes them to be good substrates for multidrug resistance (MDR) transporters. These transporters are responsible for effluxing cytotoxins out of the tumor cells, thus compromising efficacy. However, Kovtun et al. has shown that using a hydrophilic linker with maytansinoids produced a hydrophilic metabolite of DM1 which was not an MDR substrate (10). This hydrophilic-linked DM1 ADC was markedly more effective in an MDR-1-expressing human xenograft tumor than the MCC-DM1 ADC.",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) are mAbs that are chemically linked to cytotoxic agents. Although the concept exists for decades, only recent advances in linker, drug, and antibody technology have turned ADCs into valuable therapeutic agents as illustrated by the recent approvals of brentuximab-vedotin (Adcetris) and ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1, marketed as Kadcyla). In addition to these approved ADCs, more than 30 other ADCs are currently in clinical trials of which the majority are based on linker-drugs (LD) that are similar to those used in brentuximab-vedotin and T-DM1 (1,2). Like many ADCs in development, both brentuximab-vedotin and T-DM1 carry tubulin binders (an auristatin and a maytansinoid, respectively) that inhibit tubulin polymerization and cause cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis of the targeted cell. Linkers are either cleavable linkers, for example, peptide linkers (such as the di-peptide valine-citrulline used in brentuximab-vedotin) or non-cleavable linkers, for example, amide or thioether linkers (as used in T-DM1) that depend on complete degradation of the mAb in the lysosome and subsequent release of the cytotoxic agent.\n\nAlthough the marketed ADCs have an improved therapeutic index (TI) compared with classical nontargeted chemotherapeutic agents, there is still room for improvement. Brentuximab-vedotin, for example, reaches its MTD in human patients at 2.4 mg/kg every 3 weeks, which is determined by induction of peripheral sensory neuropathy, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia (3)(4)(5). Similarly, the MTD of T-DM1 is 3.6 mg/kg every 3 weeks, which is also driven by unacceptable thrombocytopenia and hepato-toxicity at higher dosages, and is accompanied by peripheral sensory neuropathy as well",

            "text": "The linker in ADCs plays a crucial role in bridging the antibody and the cytotoxic drug, representing a critical determinant of ADC stability and the profile of payload drug release. This, in turn, significantly influences therapeutic efficacy. An ideal linker should avoid inducing ADC aggregation, prevent premature payload release in the bloodstream, and facilitate the release of active drugs precisely at the desired target. Linkers are broadly classified into two main types based on cellular metabolism processes [10][11][12][13]: cleavable linkers and non-cleavable linkers. Cleavable linkers are further subdivided into chemical cleavage linkers and enzyme cleavage linkers. These linkers offer the advantage of precisely releasing cytotoxic drugs, taking into account systemic circulation and environmental disparities between normal cells and cancer cells. On the contrary, non-cleavable linkers are connected as amino acid residues within the breakdown products of the antibody, displaying low activity in the general chemical and enzymatic environments within the body, ensuring high plasma stability. Typically, non-cleavable linkers rely on enzyme hydrolysis of the ADC's antibody component, primarily facilitated by proteases, culminating in the release of the payload in a complex form.",

These conjugates release DOX molecules at lysosomal pH. They concluded a possible outcome of using a reduced amount of mAb load via branched methodology to acquire desired cytotoxic activity. 72 Recently, specificity of HER2 antibodies and enhanced activity of doxorubicin-labeled liposomes against cancer were also reported by our research group. 73 owever, poor circulation stability of hydrazine linker was also recorded as in the case of gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO), resulting in low clinical efficacy and safety. 74 n the other hand, premature release in circulation is being prevented by utilizing non-cleavable linkers. 56 Noncleavable linkers result in enzymatic degradation of ADC in lysosome and accurate release of drug with their conjugated amino acid lysine or cysteine. 67 Active research by chemists to develop new linkers and discover novel potent effector molecules that suit ADC is currently being investigated.",

Besides, H-Val-Ala-OH, another important dipeptide, has also been employed for synthesizing next-generation ADCs useful for drug loading and releasing purposes. The comparison studies of H-Val-Cit-OH and H-Val-Ala-OH based ADCs conjugated to the monomethyl auristatin E(MMAE) payload using xenograft model test showed their ability as patent payload for the antitumor activity (Wang et al., 2017b;Wang W. et al., 2017). It has also been reported that adding a hydrophilic group to the N-terminus of the valine residue in the H-Val-Cit-OH linker, viz., glutamic acid, prevents the premature cleavage of the linker in mouse plasma which otherwise is susceptible to extracellular carboxylesterase. This enhancement in the polarity of H-Val-Cit-OH linker offers higher in vivo stability to the antibody-drug conjugate in mouse plasma and allows the designing of ADC linkers (Anami et al., 2018). \n\nAn amphiphilic dendron, N-octadecanoyl-1,5-bis(L-glutamic acid)-L-glutamic diamide with potential to entrap Vitamin B 1 (VB 1 ) was found to shrink and turn into supergel triggered by monovalent to tetravalent metal ions.",

The conjugate at a highly solvent site (Fc-S396C) was the most unstable in plasma and allowed maleimide exchange of the linker drug with reactive thiols in albumin, free cysteine, or reduced glutathione. Other ADCs using maleimide chemistry such as anti-CD30-MC-MMAF and anti-CD70-MC-MMAF have also shown adduct formation in plasma, such as albumin-MC-MMAF and cys-MC-MMAF (42,43). The conjugate at a partially accessible site with a positively charged environment (LC-V205C) prevented this maleimide exchange by promoting succinimide ring hydrolysis and was the most stable in plasma. The stability of the third conjugate at a partially accessible site with a neutral environment (HC-A114C) was in between the other two and showed both mechanisms. The stability of these variants corresponded with their in vivo activity with the more stable conjugate showing greater in vivo efficacy in mouse xenograft models compared to the least stable conjugate. Other site-specific conjugation methods such as use of transglutaminase have also shown that conjugation site has an impact on ADC stability and pharmacokinetics (44). Conjugation can also impact tissue distribution of the antibody and several studies have shown a trend towards slightly increased hepatic uptake of ADCs (29,30,42).",

In another study [54], Kaempffe et al. generated three trastuzumab-derived ADCs using the Val-Cit-PABC linker via mTG conjugation at native Q295 and two engineered glutamine sites at the C-terminus of heavy or light chains. They found that, in huFcRn transgenic mice, the Q295-or light chain C-terminal-conjugated ADC displayed a superior PK property, whereas the heavy chain C-terminal-conjugated ADC showed faster clearance. Therefore, whilst linker design is an important consideration, a holistic approach is to also take into account, among other things, the site of the conjugation in ADC development. As seen from the studies discussed here, a carefully chosen conjugation site can provide a favorable local environment to protect the conjugate and the linker against chemical and/or enzymatic attacks during systemic circulation.",

            "text": "The choice of suitable linkers is likewise the challenge for the development of effective ADCs. As a small and central part of ADCs, a linker is designed to be stable in the bloodstream and subsequently release the drug in its active form within or close to the target cells [32,33]. The role of linker is fundamental for efficient delivery of the cytotoxic drug, but it is also the determinant factor to the toxicity of an ADC product. Premature release of drugs in the circulation can result in systemic toxicity and a lower therapeutic index. \n\nNeutropenia is a kind of common toxicity for many ADCs conjugated to MMAE via protease cleavable valine-citrulline linkers such as Brentuximab vedotin, ASG-5ME, Glembatumumab vedotin, Indusatumab vedotin, Polatuzumab vedotin and PSMA-targeting ADC [20,[34][35][36][37][38]. Results showed that vc-MMAE-based ADC-induced neutropenia is due to a direct cytotoxic effect of released payload on differentiated neutrophils in the bone marrow [39]. Peripheral neuropathy is another important target-independent clinical toxicity associated with microtubule inhibitor ADCs leading to treatment discontinuation and/or dose reduction [40]. Microtubule inhibitors disrupt interphase microtubule function critical for the active transport of key essential proteins from the neuron cell body to distal synapses and ultimately result in peripheral neuropathy [41]. \n\nThe mechanism of drug release is an important consideration in linker selection. Both cleavable and non-cleavable linkers have been used in approved second-generation ADCs and in third-generation ADCs that are currently being investigated in clinical trials [42,43]. Collectively, linker stability during several days in the circulation and efficient cleavage upon delivery into the target cell, should be considered for effective linker design.",

            "text": "A detailed biochemical mechanism on the stability of cysteine-maleimide-based antibody conjugates in plasma in vitro and in vivo was dissected and discussed. The maleimide exchange from an ADC to reactive thiols in plasma constituents such as albumin, cysteine or glutathione resulted in a decrease in ADC stability and therapeutic activity. In contrast, hydrolysis of a succinamide ring in the ADC enhanced the stability and therapeutic activity. ADCs with different conjugation sites seem to vary in the maleimide exchange and succinamide ring hydrolysis characteristics depending on their solvent accessibility and local charge properties. 9 n the final part of his talk, Dr. Junutula reviewed the in vitro potency, in vivo efficacy, and safety data of 4-drug load engineered ADCs and 4-drug load conventional ADCs. Both these conjugates were studied by using the same antibody and linker drug (MC-vc-PAB-MMAE) and they only differed with respect to method of conjugation as described above. ADCs derived from both methods showed similar in vitro potency, while engineered ADCs displayed a two-fold improvement in in vivo efficacy over conventional ADCs. In conclusion, Dr. Junutula highlighted that engineering site-specific ADCs will improve ADC manufacturing, define DAR, and improve safety. He also concluded that our ability to analyze and understand the in vivo metabolism of ADCs in preclinical and clinical studies will help us immensely in developing next generation ADC therapeutics. \n\nGiulio Casi (Philochem) discussed the use of non-internalizing antibodies and traceless linkers for ADC development. Oncofetal fibronectin and oncofetal tenascin represent wellcharacterized and validated targets of angiogenesis for vascular targeting. Antibodies against these proteins selectively accumulate around tumor neovasculature structures. 10,11 Dr. Casi used L19, an anti-oncofetal fibronectin antibody, to address utilization of non-internalizing antibodies in developing ADCs for vascular targeting.",

The serum stability studies with the AF88 amide conjugates showed comparable stability at the three tag sites, whereas the maytansine ester conjugates demonstrated greater stability with the CT conjugate. These observations indicate that the HIPS conjugation to the antibody is inherently stable with little difference across the three sites, and that the difference in the stability of the maytansine conjugates at the three sites is a manifestation of the differences in the protein microenvironment of the three sites and its influence on the ester bond hydrolysis. 33 Although it will need to be demonstrated empirically, we surmise that conjugation sites that work well in the context of an IgG1 ADC (explored here) might also work well in the context of other, related antibody fragments. The likely drivers determining tag site efficacy are protein conformation and the local chemical microenvironment. To the extent that these remain the same or are similar across antibodies or related proteins, our observations may hold true. \n\nThe HIPS chemistry is less subject to environmental influences at different conjugation sites, as it results in a chemically stable C\u2212C bond formation between the protein and the payload. However, other portions of the linker may well influence stability and efficacy. 13 The ability to vary linker composition in order to test the affects of length, hydrophobicity, and conformation remains an important aspect of optimizing in vivo properties of ADCs.",

[83] investigated the exposure-response relationship of eight vc-MMAE ADCs against different targets and for different tumor indications using data from eight first-in-human phase 1 studies. vc-MMAE antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) consist of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) covalently bound with a potent anti-mitotic toxin (MMAE) through a protease-labile valine-citrulline linker. PK parameters (first dose of 2.4 mg/kg) of conjugated antibody (acMMAE), total antibody, and unconjugated MMAE were estimated using non-compartmental analysis and were compared across the eight vc-MMAE ADCs. Exposure-response relationships were explored with efficacy (objective response rate (ORR)) and safety (grade 2+ peripheral neuropathy) endpoints. acMMAE exposure was strongly correlated with total antibody exposure for all the eight ADCs; as a result, the authors only used acMMAE exposure in their exposure-response analysis. A strong correlation between acMMAE and unconjugated MMAE exposure was not observed. AUC (0-infinity) at cycle 1 for acMMAE and unconjugated MMAE analytes were used as the exposure metrics and logistic regression was used to explore the exposure-response relationship. The exposure-response relationship was explored for four ADCs. A statistically significant (p < 0.05) exposure-response relationship was observed between acMMAE cycle 1 AUC (0-infinity) and ORR for three out of four ADCs. On the other hand, there was no statistically significant positive relationship between unconjugated MMAE exposure and ORR (p > 0.05). The exposure-safety (grade 2+ peripheral neuropathy) relationship was found to be statistically significant, resulting in dose reduction and discontinuation of the ADCs. The exposure-safety relationship was not statistically significant with unconjugated MMAE. \n\nThe exposure-response relationship is an effective tool to establish safety and efficacy for a drug and is widely used for small molecules as well as large molecules but is not as extensive as small molecules.",

ADCs consist of an antibody conjugated to a payload via a linker [86], which ensures stability in the body and promotes controlled payload release within the lysosome of target tumor cells. Achieving this balance requires optimizing both the linker's stability and the efficient cleavage of the payload from the ADC [87]. \n\nThe combination of these factors, along with patient variability, complicates the development of a model to characterize the clinical features of ADCs, further increasing the challenges in designing novel ADCs. Additionally, molecular aggregation of ADCs, influenced by antibody structure, hydrophilic-hydrophobic interactions, and external environmental factors, has been shown to diminish the therapeutic efficacy of the drug [88]. Therefore, optimizing next-generation ADCs requires not only design improvements but also vigilant monitoring of adverse reactions during drug administration to mitigate potential risks.",

            "text": "The structure of an ADC involves three major components, the mAb, the cytotoxic drug (payload) and a linker molecule [13,14]. The antibody binds to a specific antigen on the surface of cancer cells, followed by internalization of the conjugate by endocytosis and release of its cytotoxic payload after lysosomal degradation [13,14]. To ensure appropriate delivery of the drug to the target, it is important to ensure that the target is specific, thus expressed at high levels in tumor tissues and sparing as much as possible normal cells. High binding affinity and ability of the antigen-antibody complex to internalize after binding are also crucial steps, otherwise risk of toxicity from release to neighboring non-target cells increases [13,14]. Homogenous expression of the antigen within tumors as well as accessibility of the antigen from the bloodstream are important to maximize the availability of ADC to the target [13,14]. Immunogenicity of the antibody has been a limitation before due to mouse-derived antibodies; however development of humanized and fully human antibodies has minimized this concern [13]. \n\nCertain characteristics of the linker are also critical for the success of ADC-based therapy. Stability of the linker in the bloodstream enables the drug to be released only after binding to the target and avoid systemic toxicities. Depending on their intracellular stability and way of degradation, linkers are divided into cleavable and non-cleavable [13]. Cleavable linkers become unstable under the low pH, protease-enriched environment of lysosomes or high intracellular level of glutathione. In contrast, non-cleavable linkers are stable and solely depend on lysosomal degradation to release their payload [13,23]. \n\nThe payload is the cytotoxic drug which is responsible for the antitumor effect and reaches high concentrations in the tumor.",

In the case of ADC with cleavable linkers, it is also possible to quantify antibody-conjugated drug (acDrug) by the usage of linker-specific enzyme such as cathepsin B, papain and beta-galactosidase [4,5]. \n\nIn this work, the in vitro and in vivo linker stability was evaluated using \"middle-up\" and \"bottom-up\" approaches for the components of ADC as well as the DAR profile from in vitro mouse and immunoglobulin G (IgG) depleted human plasma and in vivo mouse preclinical pharmacokinetic studies. In the \"bottom-up\" approach, concentrations of a specific signature peptide present only in the Fc region of human monoclonal antibody (representative amounts of tAb) by trypsin digestion as well as the acDrug released by linker site-specific cleavable enzyme (representative amounts of ADC) were quantified, and then the DAR profiles of ADCs were further calculated by the relative ratio of the two components in molar concentrations (acDrug vs. tAb). In the \"middle-up\" approach, a partial digestion by FabRICATOR \u00ae and reduction by dithiothreitol (DTT) were performed to measure the intensities of the light chain and the cytotoxic drug-conjugated Fd' region (Fd' + DAR 1), and then the DAR profiles were calculated by the relative intensity ratio of the two components (Fd' + DAR 1/light chain). In addition, using the \"middle-up\" approach, catabolite identification studies at the linker conjugation site were performed simultaneously to determine the metabolites/catabolites during the DAR profile changes.",

            "text": "Species differences in drug-linker stability can lead to difficulties in evaluating the therapeutic index of an ADC based on nonclinical studies. In studies examining linker modifications that could make nonclinical studies of ADCs utilizing the cleavable valinecitrulline-p-aminobenzylcarbamate (VC-PABC) linker more comparable among species by decreasing exposure differences caused by interspecies differences in linker cleavage, the enzymatic VC-PABC cleavage observed in mouse, the species most commonly used in efficacy studies, was contrasted with the lower degree of instability detected in the plasma of rat and cynomolgus monkey, the species generally used for toxicity studies [62]. These differences were attributed to species differences in carboxylesterase activity and substrate specificity. In a report describing an in vitro whole blood assay to predict in vivo stability, cross-species differences for a variety of ADCs were highlighted and thought to reflect differences in enzyme expression and activity [63]. \n\nLinkers can also affect the physicochemical properties of the ADC, such as the tendency to aggregate, which can impact ADC efficacy, hepatotoxicity, and immunogenicity [64,65]. When hydrophilic glucuronide-based drug linkers were compared to dipeptide linkers during the development of ADCs employing camptothecin cytotoxins, the more hydrophilic glucuronide drug linkers led to less antibody aggregation than the dipeptide drug linkers [66]. This study also reported that the dipeptide (vc) conjugate of a camptothecin analog with a mAb against the Lewis-Y antigen had no effect on tumor growth in a mouse model, while the corresponding glucuronide conjugate induced substantial tumor growth delay.",

            "text": "The amine group (-NH 2 ) of lysine and sulfhydryl group (-SH) of cysteine in an antibody are generally available for attachment of the linker. A typical IgG1 antibody has roughly 80 lysine residues, but fewer than ten are chemically available for modification. Although random conjugation to lysine residues may generate higher DAR, targeting lysine generates a heterogeneous ADC with a spectrum of DARs and differing conjugation sites. A heterogeneous ADC population with random conjugation sites may confer suboptimal potency and altered solubility, stability, and/or pharmacokinetics, all affecting their antigen-binding properties. Conversely, the advantage of cysteinemediated conjugation is that the limited number and locations of cysteine-conjugation sites generate lower heterogeneity than lysine-based conjugation. Cysteines have a role in the intrachain and interchain disulfide bridges of antibodies. IgG1 antibody has four interchain disulfide bridges, and the bridges can be reduced to eight sulfhydryl groups for conjugation. TOP1-ADCs in a clinical trial for FDA approval have utilized the sulfhydryl group of cysteine to generate ADC. Maleimide chemistry is a common linker strategy for sulfhydryl conjugation. One limitation of maleimide chemistry is that its instability in plasma allows separation of drug-linkers from the ADC. Therefore, work is underway to improve the stability of sulfhydryl-based conjugation; for example, by hydrolysis of succinimide [74,75]. \n\nA major concern in joining the linker to the camptothecin-derived drug is to avoid conjugation sites that diminish drug activity. Since TOP1-ADCs in current clinical trials are formulated with SN-38 or Dxd (exatecan derivative), we focus upon these two drugs in our discussion of linker conjugation.",

This strategy yielded the earliest clinical success with Mylotarg and was later employed in Besponsa 2,10 . However, the insufficient stability of acid-cleavable linkers severely limits their application in ADCs, and a phenylketone-derived hydrazone linker was hydrolyzed with a t 1/2 Z 2 days in human and mouse plasma. The serum stability of the Sacituzumab govitecan (Trodelvy), which contains acidcleavable carbonate linkers, was also unsatisfactory with a t 1/2 Z 36 h 27 . Accordingly, acid-cleavable ADCs require more stable linkers or must employ only moderately cytotoxic payloads. \n\nIn 2019, our group developed a novel silyl ether-based acidcleavable ADC carrying highly cytotoxic monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE, Fig. 3) 28 . This design greatly improved the stability of the acid-cleavable linker and should be sufficient to support acidcleavable ADCs containing highly cytotoxic payloads. Compared with the traditional hydrazine linker (t 1/2 Z 2 days) and carbonate linker (t 1/2 Z 36 h), the t 1/2 of the novel silyl ether linker-MMAE conjugate was more than 7 days in human plasma. This novel ADC containing a silyl ether linker possessed strong cell inhibitory activity (HER2 \u00fe cell lines, IC 50 Z 0.028e0.170 nmol/L) and exhibited a better therapeutic effect than monoclonal antibodies in a mouse xenograft model.",

            "text": "Non-cleavable linkers are utilized in roughly 20% of the ADCs presently in the clinic [7], however, the non-cleavable technologies currently undergoing clinical evaluation show various levels of linker instabilities, both pre-clinically as well as in the clinic [27][28][29][30]. Several new technologies have been recently developed [12,14,15], which aim at improving the stability of non-cleavable linkers. We utilized a transglutaminase-based site-specific conjugation method which generates a stable amide linkage between a primary amine of the linker-payload and a glutamine side chain on the antibody [16,17]. The created linkage remains inert in plasma environment (both in vitro and in vivo), which allowed us to systematically examine metabolic processes acting upon the auristatin payload itself across multiple conjugation sites. \n\nWe found that the transglutaminase isopeptide linkage and the Amino-PEG6 linker of the non-cleavable PEG6-C2-MMAD conjugates were very stable in mouse, rat, cynomolgus monkey, and human plasma. The high stability of this linkage allowed us to detect degradation of the C-terminal dolaphenine moiety of the MMAD upon exposure to rodent plasma. The extent of MMAD metabolism in the plasma depends on the site of conjugation, with certain sites offering more protection than others. Although it is either absent or greatly reduced in primates in vitro, the problem of premature toxin degradation in the circulation appears most severe in mice, and can confound mouse efficacy studies. Understanding these differences among species and eliminating the cleavage mechanism in rodents is essential for preclinical efficacy and safety studies. The cleavage process appears more efficient in vivo than in vitro, suggesting that the enzyme involved either becomes inactivated in vitro and needs to be replenished, or its activity is not optimal under the in vitro plasma stability assay conditions, or both.",

As others have shown, we also observe that several in vivo pharmacological properties of these ADCs are site-dependent 26,28,36 .

In particular, R355 is significantly more potent than N389. We see a site-dependence in clearance rate, as N389 clears significantly faster than the other conjugates, though all conjugates show similar half-lives as the parent unconjugated antibodies. Though R355 appears slightly more potent than F404 and S136, the differences are not statistically significant, which is consistent with their similar PK profiles and in vitro activities. Conjugation site also affects linker degradation in vivo as N389 loses drug in plasma, but the other AB4285 conjugates retain the same DAR for 20 days.

The microenvironment of the conjugation sites including solvent accessibility and charges has been demonstrated to have a substantial impact on the in vivo stability and activity of ADCs [213]. The presence of trisulfide bonds, for example, has also been shown to affect conjugation and the resulting drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) [16,214]. Higher levels of heterogeneity have been reported for ADCs based on IgG2 mAbs, which are known for their various disulfide bond isoforms and difference in disulfide bond accessibility [215].",

            "text": "DAR of 8 is less effective in vivo than one with a DAR of 4, 23 which has led to the norm of targeting a DAR of 4 for an ADC. However, recent \ue103ndings suggest that by reducing the hydrophobicity of the ADC, the ADC with a DAR of 8 performs much better in vivo 19 and is a feasible alternative. Thus, the higher DAR would not be a disadvantage if the linker was made hydrophilic by the use of PEG, for example, to alter the pharmacokinetic properties. For instance, the Fleximer technology conjugates up to 20 drug molecules per antibody without concerns due to the presence of a very hydrophilic polymer. 38 With the Pt(II) linker, as it is possible to achieve a maximum DAR of 8, we included a PEG chain in our linker-design to compensate for the drug's hydrophobicity, which decreased aggregation of the resulting ADCs. If more hydrophobic drugs were to be employed or higher DARs were desired, higher chain length of PEG could be built-in to the design. Pt(II)-linked ADCs thus allow the \ue104exibility of higher loading of drug per antibody resulting in an enhanced delivery of the payload. Overall, higher-DAR ADCs coupled with a stable linker like Pt(II) and a nanomolar potency drug such as camptothecin would provide a wider therapeutic window, and can potentially circumvent the use of extremely potent cytotoxics that are associated with dose-limiting toxicities in the clinic.",

            "text": "Linkers are divided into non-cleavable and cleavable linkers [108]. Non-cleavable linkers form stable bonds with antibodies and have a longer half-life in circulation. Further, after internalization, non-cleavable linkers should degrade in the lysozyme to release the drug molecule inside the targeted tumor cell. The stability of cleavable linkers depends on the physiological conditions in the tumor tissue and the expression of enzymes for cleavage of the linker to release the drug in the tumor site. The tumor toxicity of the ADC depends on the choice of payload (drug molecule) attached to the antibody. Conventional cancer drugs, such as DOX or mitomycin, have been used with ADCs. In general, the payload in ADCs is engineered to target either DNA or tubulin to interfere with cell division and proliferation. The conjugation chemistry affects the drug pharmacokinetics and therapeutic index of ADC. The conjugation of the payload largely occurs through the linker via the alkylation or acetylation of lysine side chains in the backbone of the antibody [106]. \n\nNanomaterials 2021, 11, 1755 15 of 25 binds with a high specificity to the antibody to minimize off-target toxic side effects to healthy cells. The number and density of target antigen molecules on the surface of CSCs affect the extent of the ADC engulfment by tumor cells. Further, antigen secretion by the CSCs to the circulation should be minimal to limit the circulatory detection of the ADCantigen and activation of the immune system. Table 1 summarizes the list of surface antigens on tumor cells used in designing antibody-drug conjugates for different types of cancers [104,106]. Another factor is the selection of an antibody to target the antigens on the surface of CSCs with a high specificity, strong binding affinity, and long circulation half-life for prolonged uptake and retention by the tumor tissue. The efficient internalization by CSCs and low immunogenicity of the ADC are important factors in the selection process [106,107].",

The lysine and cysteine residues on the antibody provide the accessible reaction sites for conjugation [36,37]. A varying number (0-8) of small-molecule toxins may be attached to an antibody, as the conventional conjugation methods are random, resulting in a wide drug-antibody ratio (DAR) distribution [38]. The ideal DAR is 2-4. A low DAR can lower the efficacy, while a high DAR may increase the drug potency, but it also could negatively affect antibody structure, stability, and antigen binding, leading to faster clearance and decrease in overall clinical activity [39].

            "text": "As reported in the introduction section, antibodies have also become relevant in nanomedicine thanks to the development of ADCs. These glycoproteins present an insufficient clinical activity themselves and ADCs emerged to empower their antiproliferative effect [75,76]. Thereby, such conjugates are produced with the objective of selectively ablating cancer cells by combining the action of a highly potent cytotoxic compound with antibody specificity for a target antigen, with these two compounds being conjugated through a linker [24,75]. In this way, after binding it, the ADC-antigen complex is internalized and transported to cellular organelles (generally lysosomes) where the release of the attached drug can take place [75]. To improve its therapeutic activity without compromising safety, ADCs must limit the exposure of normal tissues to the transported drugs and only deliver the payload to the tumor cells that express the chosen antigen [75,76]. For this reason, linker technologies that ensure an adequate stability of the drug in ADCs are required so that the drug release does not occur in circulation [76]. Besides, the method employed in ADC conjugation conditions the drug loading stoichiometry and homogeneity and determines its anti-tumor activity, efficacy, and tolerability [76,77]. \n\nFor such conjugations, at the beginning of ADC development, acid-labile hydrazone linkers that can be cleaved in the acid environment of endosomes and thus allow the release of the ADC payload in these organelles were selected. However, disulfide-based linkers demonstrated later to be a better choice because they were more stable at a physiological pH, and nowadays they are normally preferred to anchor cytotoxic compounds to antibodies [75].",

            "text": "ADCs have experienced a surge in FDA approvals over the past few years, but the interplay of linker stability, payload potency and properties, target selection, and dosing has made design challenging. Here, we show an important mechanism driving the efficacy of SG is the high tissue penetration and rapid linker release inside cells. Although the design of SG is counterintuitive at first glance, these data clarify the efficacy advantage of a lower stability linker. We proposed two hypotheses that could explain the benefits of using a less stable linker: (i) extracellular linker cleavage in the tumor interstitium that better leverages the bystander effect (Fig. 1B) and/or (ii) more rapid payload release inside cells for more efficient cell killing (Fig. 1C), two mechanisms that are not mutually exclusive. Multiscale imaging and analysis of SG disposition were used to test these hypotheses and detail other delivery rates relevant to its positive therapeutic window. \n\nADC dosing is often limited by the toxicity of the conjugated payload, which prevents the use of saturating doses when the target antigen is highly expressed and/or rapidly internalized in the tissue (27). However, the use of SN-38, a moderately potent topoisomerase I inhibitor with a single-digit nanomolar IC 50 (8), allows for higher dosing. In fact, SG has the highest dosing regimen of any clinically approved ADC (28). Challenges in overcoming the binding site barrier have been documented for Kadcyla, which treats HER2 \u00fe breast cancer (29,30). These studies also showed the connection between improved tissue penetration and efficacy (31). In this system, Dual-labeled ADC for quantifying extracellular release. By labeling hRS7 antibody with two residualizing dyes, AF488 (green star) attached directly to antibody via a stable amide linkage and SN38-AF680 (red star) connected via the CL2A hydrolysable linker, the location of payload release could be quantified. Extracellular released SN38-AF680 dye (red star) is unable to enter cells and washes out of the tumor, while intracellularly released payload is trapped (A).",

With more than 50 ADCs currently in the clinical pipeline, 1 the prospects for the ADC \ue103eld have escalated remarkably since the approvals of brentuximab vedotin (Adcetris\u2122) 2 for Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2011 and ado-trastuzumab emtansine (Kadcyla\u2122) 3 for HER2+ breast cancer in 2013.\n\nThe success of an ADC is dependent on various factors such as the target antigen, the antibody and the drug. However, the mainstay of an effective ADC lies in its linker-the glue that couples the drug and the antibody together until the ADC reaches the cancer cell. Conventionally, linker-drugs have been coupled to either lysines on the antibody, as in ado-trastuzumab emtansine, 3 or to cysteines via maleimide chemistry, as in brentuximab vedotin (Scheme 1a and b). 2 Both technologies have major limitations, such as the former producing heterogeneous ADCs 4,5 and Scheme 1 Comparison of conventional linker technologies with a Pt(II)-linker. (a) Conjugation to lysines results in a heterogeneous mixture. (b) Conjugation to cysteines via maleimide leads to reduced higher order structural stability and instability in the presence of albumin. (c) Pt(II)-linker re-bridges the antibody chains with strong Pt-S interaction imparting stability, homogeneity and site-specificity. the latter being unstable during circulation. 6 While heterogeneous ADCs have unpredictable safety and PK pro\ue103les and show batch-to-batch variability, the instability of maleimide chemistry results in off-target toxicity. 4 These shortcomings with current linker technologies have hindered the concept of an ideal \"magic bullet\", as envisioned by Paul Ehrlich, 7 to be realized.\n\nIn the last few years, several ideas have emerged to address these issues.",

For this purpose, drug PDB files from the Open National Cancer Institute Database, antibody PDB files from the RCSB Protein Data Bank, and the PDB file of the non-cleavable linker molecule C 15 N were used. Between the linker and the drug, as well as between the antibody lysine and the linker-drug conjugate, hydrogen bonds were formed.

Parameters such as the amino acid participating in the conjugation, the DAR, the type of linker and drug used, as well as the chemical bonds formed between the components of the conjugate can vary. Besides lysine, other natural or synthetic amino acids such as cysteine, selenocysteine, or acetylphenylalanine can be connected with a linker-drug conjugate. In addition, other non-cleavable or cleavable linkers can be used, while maytansinoids, auristatins, calicheamicins, and duocarmycins can be used as cytotoxic substances. \n\nAn example of a different conjugation technique is the formation of a covalent bond between an amino acid and a reactive functional group pendent to the linker-drug conjugate.

This includes, but is not limited to, antibody engineering to facilitate direct site-specific conjugation, modification of conjugation chemistry and introduction of novel linker compositions to confer enhanced stability, as well as, the exploration of additional existing and novel chemical entities/modalities as conjugates to increase the pharmacological applications of ADCs. Many of these advancements to design better molecules are intricately interdependent with optimizing or improving the ADME drug-ability properties of ADCs, such as linker-payload stability, distribution, and pharmacokinetics (PK). This is because defining the exposure-response relationship for both safety and efficacy has been intimately tied with ADC peripheral PK, target tissue or site of action concentration and the disposition of the payload at the intended site. The criticality of understanding the exposure-response relationship and therapeutic index (TI) for ADCs is exemplified by Mylotarg \u00ae (gemtuzumab ozogamicin) which is composed of a CD33 mAb linked to the cytotoxic drug calicheamicin via an acid-liable hydrazine linker. While initially approved for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in 2000, it was pulled from the market at the request of regulatory agencies in 2010 due to safety concerns and the failure to reproduce the clinical benefit connected to linker stability in AML patients. Following additional interrogation of exposure-response relationships, examining alternative lower dosing and scheduling, Mylotarg found a path back to the market and received a new FDA approval for newly diagnosed CD-33 positive acute AML patients in 2017. \n\nDissecting the ADME properties of ADCs is a complex endeavor given the unique properties of each component within the molecules. ADC ADME involves delineating the intertwined properties of linker-payload stability, pharmacokinetics, clearance, metabolism, and disposition of mAb, conjugate (i.e., small molecule chemical entity for traditional ADCs), as well as, the ADC entity itself.",

            "text": "It took more than 50 years since the pioneering studies by Math\u00e9 et al. on targeted tumor treatment with methotrexate for the first antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), Adcetris \u00ae , to reach market approval in 2011. Since then, three more ADCs were approved or re-approved, i.e., Kadcyla \u00ae (in 2013), Besponsa \u00ae (2017), and Mylotarg \u00ae (2017). Mechanistically, ADCs exert their activity by (a) selective binding of antibody to tumor; (b) internalization; and (c) lysosomal degradation and liberation of toxic payload, leading to cytotoxic cell death [1]. In recent years, however, evidence has emerged that conjugation technology is also a critical component in determining quality attributes of an ADC [2,3]. For example, although the majority (~65%) of clinical ADCs are based on random payload attachment [4], a clear trend toward site-specifically conjugated ADCs based on engineered cysteine can be noted (currently >10 in the clinic), generally showing an increased therapeutic index [5,6]. A range of other site-specific conjugation technologies has been explored in the past decade [1,4,[7][8][9], but to date only genetic encoding [10] of a non-natural amino acid (p-acetophenylalanine), suitable for oxime ligation, has reached clinical status (two ADCs).\n\nBesides conjugation technology, the nature of the linker connecting the antibody and the toxic payload also determines ADC properties, particularly in light of the high hydrophobicity of (nearly) all cytotoxic payloads, which may negatively impact manufacturability, stability (aggregation) [11], pharmacokinetics [12], and therapeutic index [13]. To offset payload hydrophobicity, Immunogen introduced onto the linker of DM4 a negatively charged sulfonyl group [14,15]: for example, in phase III, the folate receptor-targeting ADC IMGN853 (mirvetuximab soravtansine",

            "text": "Cancer is still one of the major threats to human health. However, cancer therapies used today always have more or less adverse side effects to normal tissues. Targeted therapy is a promising strategy to address this challenge. The pioneer of targeted therapy is Paul Ehrlich who introduced the principle \"magic bullet\" at the beginning of the 20th century [1]. To avoid side effects, drugs should be specifically delivered to cancer cells via binding to ligands that can specifically recognize the cancer-associated biomarkers such as antigens. Among the ligands for targeted therapy, antibodies are excellent candidates because of their specific recognitions and high affinities. Nowadays, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are attracting tremendous attention for targeted cancer therapy. \n\nAntibody-drug conjugates are biotherapeutics that consist of monoclonal antibodies, potent cytotoxic drugs and linkers between them (Figure 1). The monoclonal antibodies lead the drug precursors to the target cancer cells, in which the prodrugs can be chemically or enzymatically converted to drugs in their active forms [2]. Conjugating cytotoxins to monoclonal antibodies that specifically tie to tumor cell surface antigens enables the drugs to be target-delivered to cancer cells and leaves normal cells unaffected. More important, many of the cytotoxic drugs that are too toxic for use in traditional chemotherapy can also be used in the construction of antibody-drug conjugates [3,4]. The linkers are also essential parts of antibody-drug conjugates, which account for stability in circulation, good pharmacokinetics and efficient release of toxic drugs in the tumor cells. \n\nThe selection of antibody, drug, and linker has recently been summarized in a few excellent reviews [5][6][7][8][9][10][11]. In this review, we mainly describe the linking methods to design and synthesize ADCs, including those that are not discussed in the reviews mentioned above. \n\nThe selection of antibody, drug, and linker has recently been summarized in a few excellent reviews [5][6][7][8][9][10][11].",

            "text": "The linker in ADCs connects the antibody with the cytotoxic drug. It plays a critical role in the stability of ADCs and the release profiles of payloads, consequently influencing the therapeutic index of ADCs. An ideal linker should limit premature payload release in plasma while facilitating the active release of drugs at the desired target sites. Most ADCs employ two types of linkers: cleavable and non-cleavable. The first ones are designed to cleave under specific conditions, such as in a low-pH environment or in the presence of proteolytic enzymes [5]. \n\nThe cytotoxic payload is the active component that exerts cytotoxicity upon the internalization of ADCs into cancer cells. These compounds must remain stable under physiological conditions and possess functional groups suitable for conjugation with the antibody. To date, the cytotoxic payloads utilized in ADCs primarily comprise potent tubulin inhibitors and DNA-damaging agents [8,9]. In this light, the drug-antibody ratio (DAR) represents the average number of payload molecules (ranging from 2 to 8) attached to each monoclonal antibody. While ADCs with higher DARs exhibited greater potency in vitro, preclinical evidence demonstrated that they may have higher toxicity and a lower therapeutic index [10]. \n\nFollowing intravenous injection, ADCs bind to their target antigens and undergo receptor-mediated endocytosis for internalization within the cell. Once inside the cell, the cytotoxic payload carries out its cytotoxic role through its interaction with microtubules or DNA. In addition, apoptotic cells or ADCs may release the cytotoxic component into the extracellular space, potentially inducing cell death in neighboring cells, a phenomenon known as the \"bystander effect\" [11]. \n\nThe current review aims to explore the past, the present, and the future of ADCs as therapeutic agents for the treatment of advanced SCLC (Figure 1).",

            "text": "As described above, the linker serves as a spacer to connect the mAb to the payload, a cytotoxic drug that must be released in the tumor site to properly exert its pharmacological effects. To be suitable as payloads in ADCs, chemicals shall ideally have low molecular weight and immunogenicity, high stability in the blood circulation and endosomal/lysosomal pathways, and high cytotoxicity (Peters and Brown, 2015;Khongorzul et al., 2020;Baah et al., 2021;Mckertish and Kayser, 2021). Because intravenous administration has shown that only a very small fraction of ADC reaches the tumor (0.1%-2%) (Chari, 2008;Hughes, 2010;Beck et al., 2017), their payloads must be 100-to 1000-fold more effective than the drugs used in chemotherapeutics as free small molecules (Baah et al., 2021). Given that the goal of the ADC strategy is to achieve potent cytotoxic activity, an important attribute to consider in the design process of these compounds is the Drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR), a value that indicates the average number of chemical molecules conjugated to the mAb. For current conjugation methods based on lysine side-chain amidation or mainly on the reduction of cysteine intermediate-chain disulfide bonds, the common DAR values range from 0 (lowest value) to 8 (highest value) (Dan et al., 2018;Wagh et al., 2018;Sun Kang et al., 2021). Nevertheless, in vivo experiments have demonstrated that a high DAR value negatively correlates with Ab pharmacokinetics. Although a low DAR implies the loading of poor number of drug molecules and consequently lower therapeutic efficacy, it is worth noting that an average DAR of 2 to 4 results in an ADC with greater anti-cancer activity/efficacy compared to an ADC with higher DAR, likely because the latter is more rapidly cleared from the body when compared to the corresponding average-conjugated counterparts (Hamblett et al., 2004;Strop et al., 2015).",

            "text": "The search for directed and effective cytotoxic therapy has been the Holy Grail of cancer treatment since being hypothesised as a treatment for cancer over a century ago [1]. Despite this, the mainstay of treatment for over half a century and up until today remains chemotherapy. While effective in many cancers, chemotherapy is associated with frequent off-target effects resulting in significant toxicities [2]. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are compounds comprising three distinct components to effectively target cancer cells: a monoclonal antibody, a cytotoxic payload, and a linker that binds these two components. ADCs have been successful as they selectively target cancer cells with a highly toxic payload via antibody binding to specific tumour antigens, and spare non-malignant tissues [3,4]. \n\nThe theory behind ADCs was first developed in the 1960s, with the first animal studies conducted in the 1980s [5]. Challenges with the first generation of ADCs included the unstable linker component, which led to premature drug release into the circulation [6]. \n\nStabilising the drug molecule, determining appropriate ratios of drug to antibody, and improving ADC half-lives have been major challenges in ADC development [7]. Conventional chemotherapies such as anthracyclines were originally used as payloads but were ineffective due to a lack of relative lack of potency [6]. Early antibodies used were predominantly chimeric humanised or mouse-derived and were associated with higher immunogenicity and drug reactions compared to next-generation humanised antibodies [6]. Another barrier to the utility of ADCs was the limited number of antigen targets. Significant progress has been made since and a growing number of ADCs have now been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for clinical use following positive results from phase 3 trials when compared against current standards of care. In this review, we will discuss the structure and mechanisms of actions of ADCs, present the data from seminal clinical ADC trials, and provide an overview of the challenges facing the ongoing clinical development of ADCs.",

For example, in trodelvy, used in a treatment for patients with triple-negative breast cancer, the linker may release the drug prior to internalization. (3) Payload: The payload may be a subunit used in cellular tracking, imaging, or most commonly toxic drug therapeutics. The overall goal of ADCs is to deliver the payload directly to target cells via the antibody without affecting normal, healthy tissue. \n\nImportantly, the use of antibodies in modern medicine is not restricted solely to ADCs and cancer therapy. For example, mABs now find routine use in the context of radionuclide (PET) imaging agents, informing therapeutic decision-making [6,7]. \n\nAntibody-oligonucleotide conjugates, antibody-enzyme conjugates, antibody-polymer conjugates, antibody-nanomaterial conjugates, antibody-catalyst conjugates, and antibodies involved in protein degradation also play critical roles in biomedical research and therapies [2]. \n\nIn whatever capacity, the use of antibodies applied to medicine is critically dependent on the ability to anchor them to operative payloads in a highly precise manner [8][9][10]. Many researchers are tackling the challenge of new strategies for chemoselective synthetic modifications of biomolecules, including antibodies [11]. In the case of ADCs, conjugation of the linker/payload to the antibody must not drastically alter the pharmacokinetics or physicochemical properties of the antibody [12,13]. Typically, zero to eight payloads are attached to the antibody. Heterogeneous ADCs may thus be a mix of both unconjugated and \"overloaded\" antibodies. Unconjugated antibodies compete with antibodies containing payloads for binding, which can diminish the effectiveness of the antibodypayload materials. On the other hand, excessive loading of the antibody can lead to antibody aggregation, increased toxicity, decreased stability, and/or a shorter ADC half-life [14]. Optimization of the drug/antibody ratio (DAR) and payload distribution/location thus becomes significant for ideal ADC design.",

A(P)DCs have three major components, antibody (targeting protein), linker and payload, the cytotoxic drug. Recently, advances in identifying targets, selecting highly specific mAbs of preferred isotypes, optimizing linker technology and improving chemical methods for conjugation have led to the approval of two ADCs by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and more than 30 ADCs in advanced clinical development. However, the complex and heterogeneous nature of A(P)DCs often cause poor solubility, instability, aggregation and eventually unwanted toxicity. This article reviews the main components of A(P)DCs, and discusses the choices for drugs, linkers and conjugation methods currently used. Future work will need to focus on developments and strategies for overcoming such major problems associated with the A(P)DCs.",

            "text": "Chemotherapy remains a cornerstone in cancer treatment, utilizing cytotoxic agents to kill or inhibit the growth of cancer cells. However, its efficacy is often limited by systemic toxicity and the development of resistance. To address these challenges, Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs) have emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy, combining the specificity of monoclonal antibodies with the potency of cytotoxic drugs. ADCs are designed to deliver targeted chemotherapy directly to cancer cells, reducing off-target effects and improving therapeutic outcomes. The structure of ADCs consists of a monoclonal antibody, a cytotoxic agent (payload), and a chemical linker. The antibody specifically binds to tumor-associated antigens, facilitating internalization of the drug, which is then released within the cancer cell to induce cell death. This selective targeting minimizes the damage to normal, healthy tissues. Since the first ADC approval in 2000, the field has rapidly advanced, with multiple ADCs receiving FDA approval for both hematological and solid tumors. Despite their potential, ADC development faces challenges such as linker stability, payload delivery, and tumor penetration. Recent advancements have led to the development of second and third-generation ADCs, which feature improved stability, efficacy, and safety profiles. The future of ADCs lies in optimizing their design, including selecting appropriate antigens, refining drug-to-antibody ratios, and enhancing intracellular delivery mechanisms. Overall, ADCs represent a transformative approach to cancer therapy, offering a more targeted, effective, and safer treatment option for cancer patients.\nKeywords: ADC, Cancer, Chemotherapy, Cytotoxic drug, Carrier, Linker, Target therapy, Toxicity.",

The greatest advantage Linkers are classified according to different categories in terms of the mechanism of drug release and their stability in circulation, including cleavable linkers and non-cleavable linkers [32,42]. Cleavable linkers rely on the physiological environment, such as there being high glutathione concentrations, low pH, and special protease, which could assist the linkers in enabling chemical or biochemical reactions by way of hydrolyzation or proteolysis [3,43]. Non-cleavable linkers despond on the monoclonal antibody degradation after ADCs' internalization within the lysosomes and endosomes to generate the metabolites containing the active cytotoxic drugs with or without a portion of the linkers. On account of different mechanism strategies, differences between the potential ADC metabolisms and the varying characteristics of cytotoxic drugs should be taken into consideration [44]. \n\nEach release strategy must account for many factors: the various activities of cytotoxic drugs, the characteristics of monoclonal antibodies, and the particular disease.

Taken together, our results indicate that the Pt-based ADC platform meets the requirement of stability in addition to homogeneity.\n\nThe stability of the linker coupled with the choice of payload is instrumental in determining the therapeutic window. 34,35 The initial development with ADCs used nanomolar range cytotoxics such as doxorubicin, which did not succeed in translating to clinical development. It was speculated that the low potency of the drug was responsible for the lack of efficacy. It was later discovered that the main reason for its failure was the choice of the antigen rather than the cytotoxic itself. 36,37 The current trend with ADCs is to employ drugs effective in a sub-nanomolar range such as calicheamicins, maytansinoids and auristatins. 1 However, using such highly potent cytotoxics implies that even small amounts of the drug leaching out from the ADC can result in signi\ue103cant off-target toxicity, as was observed in Mylotarg\u2122, an ADC that employs a low-stability pH-sensitive linker with calicheamicin as the payload, which was withdrawn from the market due to toxicity issues. 34 With a better choice of antigens and antibodies and the optimization of the linker technology, it has been realized that drugs with nanomolar potency, such as camptothecin, could also prove efficacious. In fact, ADCs employing SN-38, a camptothecin derivative, are in phase 1/2 of clinical development 1 and offer the advantage of a wider therapeutic window. 37 Indeed, we observed that we could administer 10 doses of our ADC at 20 mg kg \u00c01 without any visible adverse effects, potentially arising from the enhanced stability of the Pt-S interaction and the use of a nanomolar potency drug in camptothecin.\n\nIt has been reported that an ADC with a DAR of 8 is less effective in vivo than one with a DAR of 4, 23 which has led to the norm of targeting a DAR of 4 for an ADC. However, recent \ue103ndings suggest that by reducing the hydrophobicity of the ADC, the ADC with a DAR of 8 performs much better",

            "text": "All ADCs currently applied in the clinic, or in clinical trials, have been manufactured using chemical conjugation involving linkers that covalently attach the toxic payload to either primary amino groups of lysine residues in the antibody structure, or to free thiol groups that are usually generated by mild reduction of intra-chain disulphide bridges of the antibody [14,15]. Because antibodies contain many lysine and cysteine residues, this approach produces heterogeneous mixtures of drug substances that present challenges with respect to analytical characterization and manufacturing. Despite their average drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) of approximately 3.5 to 4, currently approved ADCs comprise individual components with DARs ranging from 0 to 8 [14], each behaving differently with respect to their pharmacokinetic, efficacy, and safety profiles [16]. \n\nIn addition to the inherent heterogeneity of ADCs generated by this standard chemical conjugation, the maleimide-based linkers used in all ADCs currently in clinical trials and on the market have been found to exhibit instability in human serum. The maleimide-linker reaction can be reversed by the free thiol group of cysteine-34 in human serum albumin by a retro-Michael reaction [17]. This leads to a certain level of premature and systemic release of toxic payload from the ADCs, before they have reached their cancer targets. This is likely to have a negative impact on the efficacy and side-effect profile of such maleimide linker-containing ADCs. \n\nAs a result of these short-comings of traditional chemical conjugation, there is currently great interest in the further development of drug conjugation technologies, not only on sitespecific payload conjugation to generate homogeneous ADC drug substances [14,18], but also on novel linkers that avoid maleimide-based chemistries with suboptimal in vivo stability 19]. \n\nOne possible solution to both problems with current ADC formats is the enzymatic conjugation of payloads [14,18], e.g. by using sortase enzymes.",

            "text": "Antibody\u2013drug Conjugates (ADCs) are a powerful therapeutic modality for cancer treatment. ADCs are multi-functional biologics in which a disease-targeting antibody is conjugated to an effector payload molecule via a linker. The success of currently used ADCs has been largely attributed to the development of linker systems, which allow for the targeted release of cytocidal payload drugs inside cancer cells. Many lysosomal proteases are over expressed in human cancers. They can effectively cleave a variety of peptide sequences, which can be exploited for the design of ADC linker systems. As a well-established linker, valine-citrulline-p-aminobenzyl carbamate (ValCitPABC) is used in many ADCs that are already approved or under preclinical and clinical development. Although ValCitPABC and related linkers are readily cleaved by cathepsins in the lysosome while remaining reasonably stable in human plasma, many studies have shown that they are susceptible to carboxylesterase 1C (Ces1C) in mouse and rat plasma, which hinders the preclinical evaluation of ADCs. Furthermore, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, two of the most commonly observed dose-limiting adverse effects of ADCs, are believed to result from the premature hydrolysis of ValCitPABC by human neutrophil elastase. In addition to ValCitPABC, the GGFG tetrapeptidyl-aminomethoxy linker is also cathepsin-cleavable and is used in the highly successful ADC drug, DS8201a. In addition to cathepsin-cleavable linkers, there is also growing interest in legumain-sensitive linkers for ADC development. Increasing plasma stability while maintaining lysosomal cleavability of ADC linkers is an objective of intensive current research. This review reports recent advances in the design and structure\u2013activity relationship studies of various peptide/peptidomimetic linkers in this field.",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) is a therapeutic modality that aims to improve payload delivery specificity and reduce systemic toxicity. Considering the complex structure of ADCs, various bioanalytical methods by liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS), ligand binding assay (LBA) and hybrid LBA-LC-MS approaches have been established for ADC characterization and quantification. LCMS-based assays enable drug-antibody ratio (DAR) sensitive quantification of the conjugated payload. Typically, for quantitative, DAR-sensitive, assessment by LC-MS/MS,the conjugated payload is enzymatically liberated and quantified. Despite recent advances in ADC bioanalytical methods, the DAR-sensitive quantification of noncleavable linker ADCs by LC-MS/MS remains challenging. Thus, we developed a novel digestion-free middle-down mass spectrometry (DF-MDMS) using a collision-induced dissociation approach for absolute quantification of conjugated payload from four different ADCs in a biological matrix with minimum sample preparation. These results demonstrate that ADCs with different linker-payload structures can be quantified, including a noncleavable linker ADC, trastuzumab emtansine. It also shows that the assay sensitivity is comparable to the conventional ADC quantification method by linker-payload cleavage using enzyme, while the assay dynamic range depends on factors including payload ionization and dissociation efficiency, DAR and its distribution, and species abundance. By demonstrating absolute quantification of both cleavable and noncleavable linker ADCs, this novel middle-down ADC approach demonstrates its potential application in bioanalysis and analytical characterization, especially for early discovery where high-throughput screening is required as the new approach saves time and resources by not requiring enzymatic digestion for cleavable ADCs or development of anti-payload antibodies for noncleavable linker ADCs.",

Apart from the improved linker stabilities, more potent microtubule-targeting agents (such as auristatin and maytansinoids derivatives) were used as the cytotoxic payload to improve the general potency of ADC [1]. \n\nNonetheless, the second-generation ADC still utilizes non-specific site conjugation for the incorporation of antibodies, which generally produces ADC as heterogeneous mixtures with the drug to antibody ratio (DAR) varying from zero to eight. Furthermore, lower potency could be one of the problems due to competition from those unconjugated antibodies available in the product [90]. Additionally, off-target toxicity is still prevalent due to the non-differentiated triggers present in healthy tissue; for instance, the Val-Cit linker becomes unstable in the presence of carboxylesterase 1C (Ces 1C) enzyme, as reported in recent research on mouse models [7]. Similar to second generation ADC, the third generation ADC predominantly uses enzyme cleavable linker, albeit applying it in sidespecific conjugation to the antibody to improve the pharmacokinetics as well as its DAR [94]. \n\nAlthough with continuous and extensive efforts, the conventional ADC with internal trigger-linker is still plagued with relatively poor therapeutic index, which has limited the implementations in the pharmaceutical industry, where there were 23 out of 55 conventional ADCs that were terminated due to this very same reason [95].",

Heterogeneous ADCs were usually synthesized through the thiols of cysteine residues and the amines of lysines, however, the heterogeneity diminished their activities and promoted antibody aggregations, and increased toxicities in the circulation. Homogeneous ADCs made through the catalysis of site-specific conjugation enzymes such as AGT, BTG, aaRS and Sial T are more stable and have comparable or even better activities than those conventional analogs in vivo. We believe that a growing number of methods will be developed to synthesize ADCs in the near future, and more and more ADCs, especially site-specifically modified ADCs, will be produced.",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are innovative drugs with targeted therapeutic properties and that have emerged as promising anticancer therapies [1]. ADCs combine the specificity of monoclonal antibodies with the potency of cytotoxic payloads, enabling selective drug delivery to tumor cells and overcoming the limitations of traditional chemotherapeutic drugs, such as non-specific toxicity and low drug accumulation in tumors [2,3]. IMMU-132 (sacituzumab govitecan) was the first ADC to use the camptothecin derivative SN38 as a payload and was the first drug to successfully treat triple-negative breast cancer [4]. Later, ENHERTU (Trastuzumab, T-DXd) was the first ADC to use the camptothecin derivative Dxd as a payload, successfully achieving targeted therapy against HER2 and showing significant efficacy in HER2-positive breast cancer [5]. However, despite the clinical success of ADCs, their potential is limited by challenges such as complex pharmacokinetics, insufficient tumor targeting, inadequate payload release, and resistance mechanisms [6]. \n\nThe linker in ADCs plays a crucial role because premature release of the payload into the bloodstream can cause severe toxic reactions and diminish therapeutic efficacy [7]. An ideal linker should exhibit high stability, water solubility, and specific release properties. The linker should remain stable in the bloodstream to prevent premature payload release and should be cleaved or hydrolyzed under specific conditions within tumor cells to release the cytotoxic payload and exert therapeutic effects [8]. Song et al. [9] reported that using ether bonds as linkers in ADCs with SN38, a camptothecin derivative, enhanced payload stability while ensuring efficient drug release within target tumor cells. Polyethylene glycol (PEG), one of the most commonly used hydrophilic polymers, is widely used in ADCs to regulate water solubility owing to its simple structure and stable spatial conformation [10][11][12][13].",

Despite a relatively poor clinical success rate, $70% of the ADCs currently in clinical trials contains payloads belonging to these classes of molecules. 2 Other cytotoxic drugs include molecules targeting the DNA minor groove, 3,4 and topoisomerase I inhibitors. 5 Since only <1% of the injected dose is expected to target the tumor, the presence of payloads active in nano-or picomolar ranges is thought to be a strict requirement for ADC-based therapies. 6 Consequently, most of the ADC toxicity observed in patients is deriving from offtarget effects due to linker instability. ADCs containing microtubule inhibitors induce peripheral neuropathy, neutropenia, gastrointestinal thrombocytopenia, 7 hepatic and ocular toxicities 8 while calicheamicin based ADCs cause thrombocytopenia and hepatic dysfunction. 9 With very few exceptions, until now the paradigm that an efficient ADC must be charged with a highly potent payload has guided ADC research and development. However, the side effects associated with intrinsic cytotoxicity of the payloads are a serious limit to the ADC applicability in therapies beyond cancer. 10 In addition, the potency of the cytotoxic payload implies manufacturing problems in ADC production, because of containment restrictions required to guarantee protection of operators and environment. 11 Compared to the progress in development",

By merging the specific binding properties of antibodies to the potency of small molecules, ADCs are designed to selectively deliver cell-killing agents to targeted pathogenic tissues, while limiting systemic toxicity. Most of the ADCs developed so far are potential anticancer agents and nine of them were approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of various types of cancer (Table 1). Many other ADCs are currently in advanced clinical trials not only for anticancer applications [1][2][3][4][5] but also to treat intracellular Staphylococcus aureus bacterial infection [6], for the targeted delivery of kinase inhibitors [7], as well as ADCs with anti-inflammatory properties [8,9]. \n\nIn most approved and clinical-stage ADCs, the toxic payloads are microtubule disruptors or DNA-damaging agents [10,11]. In the first and second generations of ADCs, those payloads were conjugated to antibody component in a stochastic manner, leading to heterogeneous mixtures of chemically distinct molecules varying in both drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) and conjugation sites [1]. This last decade, with the aim to better control the position and the number of drug loads, new conjugation strategies were developed to access a new generation of ADCs with improved homogeneity [1,2,12,13]. Those site-specific reactions rely on the insertion of engineered cysteine residues [14] or unnatural amino acids within the antibodies core [15,16], enzymatic conjugation [17][18][19], cross-link of the reduced interchain disulfides with rebridging chemical reagents [20], and glycan-mediated conjugation [21]. The conjugating linkers between payload and antibody are generally classified into cleavable and noncleavable ones, which can behave quite differently in a biological system [22].",

When repeated in cynomolgus monkeys, this half-life increased to 230 hours, raising hopes that it would be as stable in humans as in non-human primates. 52 The increased duration of stability of the dipeptide linker helps reduce the disparity between long monoclonal antibody half-lifes and short 'linker' half-lifes that complicates many ADC's, avoiding the problem of unconjugated monoclonal antibody binding to all potential targets and competing with conjugated antibody administered subsequently. \n\nDuring the multicentre phase I trial, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data were collected. 47 his demonstrated that the amount of free MMAE is proportional to the dose of the ADC. Predictably, the highest concentration of ADC was found immediately after drug infusion, however it took 2-3 days (estimated by non-compartmental methods) for the MMAE concentration to peak. The half-life of the ADC is 4-6 days (3-4 days for MMAE), consistent with the finding that steady state pharmacokinetics occurs after \u223c21 days. For the MTD of 1.8 mg/kg, concentrationtime data gave a mean area-under-the-curve of 76.65 ug/mL for the ADC and 0.036 ug/mL for the MMAE, with a maximum mean concentration of 31.98 ug/mL for the ADC and 0.05 ug/mL for the MMAE. This was achieved at a median time of 0.089 days for the ADC and 2.09 days for the MMAE. \n\nAs TARC (thymus and activation related chemokine) levels have been previously correlated with HL activity 53 serum TARC levels were evaluated in the expansion phase of the phase 1 trial (12 patients). Levels of TARC reduced in all these patients, however with such a small number of patients evaluated it is difficult to extrapolate these results further.",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have emerged as a promising class of biopharmaceuticals in the field of targeted cancer therapy, offering a paradigm shift in the treatment of various malignancies [Beck et al., 2017, Tsuchikama andAn, 2018]. ADCs combine the specificity of monoclonal antibodies with the potency of cytotoxic small molecule drugs, creating a sophisticated therapeutic modality that aims to deliver highly potent drugs directly to cancer cells while minimizing systemic toxicity [Peters and Senter, 2018]. This unique approach leverages the precise targeting capabilities of antibodies to selectively bind to tumor-associated antigens, followed by internalization and subsequent release of the cytotoxic payload within the cancer cells [Lambert, 2017]. \n\nThe efficacy of ADCs is fundamentally dependent on three key components: the antibody, the linker, and the payload [Beck et al., 2017]. While each component plays a crucial role, the payload -typically a small molecule drug with potent cytotoxic activity -is particularly critical in determining the overall therapeutic efficacy of the ADC [Zhao et al., 2020]. The ideal ADC payload should possess high potency, suitable physicochemical properties for conjugation and release, and a mechanism of action effective against the target cancer cells [Beck et al., 2017, Tsuchikama andAn, 2018]. Consequently, the design, selection, and optimization of ADC payloads have become central challenges in ADC development, directly impacting the success rate of these promising therapeutics [Carter and Senter, 2018]. \n\nThe importance of accurately predicting ADC payload activity cannot be overstated in the context of ADC development. Traditional approaches to payload selection and optimization have relied heavily on empirical methods, including high-throughput screening and structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies [Beck et al., 2017]. While these methods have led to the development of several successful ADCs, they are often time-consuming, resource-intensive, and limited in their ability to explore vast chemical spaces efficiently [Zhao et al., 2020].",

            "text": "First, Dr. Zacholski introduced the landscape of ADCs in the United States and the pharmacology of ADCs. Currently, there are 13 FDAapproved ADCs: six ADCs are approved for solid tumor cancers, and seven are approved for hematologic malignancies (Table 2). ADCs have been on the US market for over a decade with the first antibody-drug conjugate, gemtuzumab ozogamicin, receiving FDA approval for acute myeloid leukemia in 2000; however, the majority of ADCs have been approved within the last five years. ADCs are comprised of three components (Fig. 1) which are integral to the overall efficacy and safety of the drug. The first component is a monoclonal antibody that is highly selective for a tumor-associated antigen that has low to no expression on other tissues. The second component is the drug conjugate also known as the payload, which is typically a conventional chemotherapy agent that causes cell death after cell internalization and payload release. Commonly used drug conjugates include anti-microtubule inhibitors, topoisomerase inhibitors, and DNA intercalating agents. These are extremely potent compounds that cannot be safely given outside of the ADC system. The last component is the linker, which attaches the monoclonal antibody and the drug conjugate together. The linker maintains the stability of the drug conjugate to the monoclonal antibody in the systemic circulation but it can efficiently release the payload within the target cell. Off-target, off-tumor effects or toxicities may occur as a result of linker degradation or instability in systemic circulation. Linkers can be cleavable or non-cleavable, which relates to the release mechanism. Cleavable linkers release their conjugate in a physiologically optimal environment such as low pH or high glutathione concentrations. Non-cleavable linkers form bonds with amino acid residues on monoclonal antibodies, and as a result, are more stable in the bloodstream. Non-cleavable linkers depend on lysosomal degradation of the monoclonal antibody in lysosomes.",

Previously the development of an ADC directed against CD44v6 was discontinued due to severe skin toxicity linked to high CD44v6 expression in the skin. 39,40 Interestingly, unlike findings with unconjugated antibody functions, current experimental evidence generally suggests that the antigen density does not directly correlate with the efficacy of the ADC. 41 Studies of lymphoma, melanoma and prostate cancer have demonstrated no direct correlation between antigen density and therapeutic response for ADCs, and findings suggest that a minimum antigen expression threshold is required for ADC efficacy. 31,42,43 The location and roles of the linker: Considerations for conjugation strategies\n\nThe linker plays a central role in connecting the cytotoxic agent to the antibody structure. One of the key functions of the linker is to maintain complex stability in the blood circulation, while allowing toxin release upon ADC internalization by target cells.\n\nThe first generation of ADCs mostly relied on linking via the antibody's lysine or cysteine residues. 6 IgG1 isotype antibodies consist of approximately 90 lysine residues, however, due to structural constrains, only 30 can be modified. 8 Therefore, linking the antibody to the toxin via the lysine residues results in heterogeneous ADCs with regards to both the number of toxins conjugated per antibody (drug-to-antibody ratio, DAR) and the positions of conjugation within the structure. Furthermore, monitoring changes on the antibody scaffold may be challenging, since, in addition to batch-to-batch variations, ADCs within one batch could differ significantly. 44 Therefore, novel methods are being developed to improve protein characterization and control protein modification processes. 45 Nevertheless, Kadcycla TM would not be a product unless regulatory authorities were satisfied that the conjugate product could be made consistently.\n\nWhen conjugating to cysteine residues, disulfide bonds within the antibody must be reduced in order to produce free thiols for conjugation. 46 IgG1 antibodies consist of 4 interchain disulfide",

            "text": "The appropriate choices of mAb, drug potency, and conjugation methodology are key elements in developing optimized ADCs for the targeted treatment of cancer. Classical ADCs stably conjugated with highly potent drugs permit selective targeting of chemotherapeutic agents that would otherwise be too toxic for general administration. In the circulation, premature drug release could result in untoward toxicities and a reduction in the therapeutic efficacy of the ADCs. In recent years, new ADCs as potential treatments for diverse epithelial cancers have appeared. For example, sacituzumab govitecan (IMMU-132) incorporates a moderately toxic drug, SN-38, at a high ratio. It uses a pH-sensitive, cleavable linker designed to impart cytotoxic activity to both target and bystander cells via ADC internalization and local release of the free drug at the tumor. 25,26 n this work, we redesigned anti-CD30-vcMMAE (ADCETRIS) to make it safer in the blood system by conjugating the antibody to DM1 through a noncleavable peptide linker to create anti-CD30-MCC-DM1. Both MMAE and DM1 belong to the class of tubulin inhibitors, and with free drug IC 50 values between 10 \u221211 and 10 \u22129 , they have been used successfully in commercialized ADCs. 27,28 ADCETRIS uses a cleavable linker to release MMAE, increasing the possibility of the bystander effect. Anti-CD30-MCC-DM1, which uses a noncleavable linker, was found to release DM1 still attached to the linker in addition to an amino acid residue. \n\nThe targeting of CD30 has an important and emerging role in the setting of Hodgkin lymphoma, ALCL, and possibly other CD30-positive malignancies. 29 CD30 has restricted expression in normal tissues, but is widely expressed in Hodgkin's disease, anaplastic large cell lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple myeloma and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. 21,30",

Methods: Four different analytical methods [AlogP calculation, reverse phase (RP) high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC; RP-HPLC), size exclusion chromatography HPLC (SEC-HPLC), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)] were tested for this comparison. Results: Maytansinoid-based ADCs showed less hydrophobicity than auristatin-based ADCs. Regardless of the drug-linker and drug-to-antibody ratios (DARs), the stability detected by DSC was decreased by conjugation. Conclusions: The cost and time-efficient analytical comparison described in this manuscript may be useful information for an initial characterization of ADCs prior to detailed biological studies.",

            "text": "These sites were located throughout the IgG, and therefore could be used to study how the conjugation site affects the properties of ADCs. Dr Strop also showed that the process is scalable, cleavable and noncleavable linkers are compatible with TG conjugation, and that diverse cytotoxic compounds can be conjugated. Two selected sites (one at the C-terminus of the heavy chain, the second in the light chain) were conjugated with AcLys-VC-MMAD and compared with a mc-VC-MMAD conventional conjugate. 21 he efficacy of the site-specific conjugates against the M1S1 target (drug-to-antibody ratio [DAR] 2) was comparable to the conventional conjugate (DAR4) in the BxPC3 mouse xenograft model; however, the site-specific conjugates were better tolerated. In the second part of the talk, Dr Strop showed data comparing the two site-specific conjugates in terms of stability and PK. \n\nData was presented showing that the site of conjugation can have an effect on the drug-linker stability. While no changes were observed in the TG linkage during the in vitro and in vivo stability studies, the ValCit cleavage element appeared to be cleaved in circulation to some extent in the heavy chain conjugate. These findings appeared to be species-dependent, and the differences between the two sites were more pronounced in rats. The total antibody distribution was also changed based on the site of conjugation. The light chain conjugate showed comparable PK to wild type antibody, while the heavy chain conjugate had a faster distribution phase. These findings were also species-dependent and were more pronounced in rats. Dr Strop concluded that the site of conjugation, the linker-payload, and the combination of the two, can modify properties of ADCs. \n\nTony Maschio (Maschio and Soames LLP) discussed how to understand and overcome intellectual property and patent law concerns when developing antibody therapeutics. He started with a recapitulation on the fundamentals of antibody patents. A first principle is that new and old technologies will generally result in broad and narrow patents, respectively.",

            "text": "Antibody-drug-conjugates (ADCs) emerged as a promising therapeutic modality prepared from naked antibodies by chemically or enzymatically conjugating a cytotoxic payload using specific linker chemistries. Most currently, cytotoxic molecules are too toxic for systemic application, thus ADCs provide a method to harness the specificity of a mAb for targeted delivery of such highly potent cytotoxic agents to tumor cells expressing a unique cognate antigen [89,91,97,104,107,108]. According to the generally accepted mechanism of action, binding of an ADC to such a tumor associated cell surface antigen, induces internalization of the ADC-antigen complex into the targeted cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis and subsequent trafficking of the ADC-loaded endosomes to the lysosomal compartment (Figure 3). Once in the lysosomes, the payload is released through enzymatic digestion or a pH-induced degradation of the linker, causing cytosolic release of the cytotoxic payload to efficiently induce cell death [109]. \n\nThe propensity of ADCs mainly depends on the nature of the mAbs, the linker, and the cytotoxic payload, which synergistically work to exert their maximal toxicities [30,[110][111][112]. For instance, the chemical nature of the linker which joins the mAb to the cytotoxic payload may negatively affect ADCs' biophysical properties, hence their potency [113,114]. The latter was corroborated by Lewis Philips et al. (2008) reporting an improved therapeutic efficacy, pharmacokinetics behavior and reduced toxicity when HER2-positive breast cancer tumor xenografts were treated with a non-reducible thioether linker-based trastuzumab-maytansinoid conjugate as opposed to its counterpart that had a reducible disulfide linker [111]. Moreover, the hydrophobic nature of most potent ADCs may reduce their therapeutic efficacy as a result of mAb aggregation and precipitation [112].",

            "text": "Antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) are an emerging class of novel biotherapeutic agents comprised of 0 to 8 cytotoxic payloads that are covalently bound via a linker to a targeted monoclonal antibody (mAb). ADCs have an average of 2-3 payloads per mAb (Fig. 1) and are thus heterogeneous mixtures of conjugates. ADCs represent promising therapeutic options in the treatment of various malignancies. Their development has generated substantial enthusiasm across industry, academia, and regulatory authorities in recent years, and more than 20 ADCs are in clinical development (Fig. 2). The rising level of interest in ADCs was evidenced by the increased presence of ADC-focused sessions at the 2012 American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists National Biotechnology Conference (NBC) held in San Diego, which included three dedicated sessions and numerous contributed papers on ADCs. Following the NBC Conference, the short course \"Translational Challenges in Developing Antibody Drug Conjugates\" was held on May 24, 2012. This one-day course provided a forum for participants to interact with speakers with expertise in preclinical and clinical ADC development, as well as a representative from the US. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The speakers provided their perspectives and shared their current thinking on ADC development. The day concluded with a panel session in which panel experts addressed questions posed by the audience. Participants included industry professionals involved in preclinical and clinical pharmacology, manufacturing, and patent law, as well as clinicians and individuals representing regulatory authorities. We present here a summary of the topics discussed during this short-course, with sections for each of the topics followed by key to ADCs, elements for successful translation of animal data to human, description of ADC analytes, and the importance of bioanalytical assays for PK and immunogenicity, as well as the ADME and biodistribution of ADCs. The composition and two main mechanism of action for ADCs whereby the antibody specifically recognizes and attaches to the receptor target on tumor cells were introduced.",

            "text": "With the development of the innovative ADC's linker conjugation platform technology, the ADC containing various linkers has been dramatically developed. Accordingly, various evaluation methods have been developed for the safety and the effectiveness of the new ADC linker. In this study, two bioanalytical approaches via the LC-qTOF-MS methods were developed and successfully applied to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo linker stability and the catabolic fate of two ADCs with different linkers (the OHPAS linker and the VC-PABC linker) of ADCs with the same backbone antibody and payload. Using the \"bottom-up\" approach, the components of ADC were quantified and the DAR profile was calculated as the relative ratio of molar concentrations for tAb and acDrug. Using the \"middle-up\" approach, the intact protein mass analysis at the subunit intact protein level was assessed for the catabolic fate of each ADC. As a result, the ADC with the OHPAS linker (ITC6103RO) was stable in both mouse and IgG depleted human plasma, whereas the ADC with the VC-PABC linker (ITC6104RO) was unstable in mouse plasma. In addition, the in vivo pharmacokinetic study in mice for two ADCs also showed consistent results with the in vitro stability data which showed low exposure and high clearance of acDrug with a VC-PABC linker. The results of intact mass protein analysis showed that the VC-PABC linker of ITC6104RO is considered to be susceptible to amide hydrolysis of the PABC site by Ces1c enzyme in mouse plasma. On the other hand, the OHPAS linker of ITC6103RO was not catabolized under the same conditions. \n\nIn conclusion, the two bioanalytical approaches via the LC-qTOF-MS methods used in this study are considered to be helpful in the evaluation of the in vitro linker stability, PK properties and catabolic fate of ADCs in the early stages of development, and further experiments would be warranted to demonstrate the efficacy and toxicity related to the perspective linker.",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are a novel class of agents consisting of three main components: \n\nantibody, linker and payload. 7  The monoclonal antibody interacts with an antigen expressed on tumour cells, and with the help of the linker, cytotoxic agents are conveyed inside the cell and degraded by lysosomes. Once free, the cytotoxic effector can perform its function, causing cell death through several mechanisms. The monoclonal antibody recognizes an antigen predominantly expressed on tumour cells relative to normal cells in order to maximize efficacy while reducing toxicity. The monoclonal antibodies are mainly represented by the immunoglobin (IgG) subtype engineered to join payload molecules. A stable attachment is granted by cysteine variations or mutations that are able to modify electric charge and create stable bonds between immunoglobulins and cytotoxic agents. \n\nThe drug:antibody ratio is defined as the number of payloads attached to IgG; however, a higher drug:antibody ratio does not necessarily confer enhanced efficacy because it could interfere with the pharmacokinetics of the ADC. 8 The antigens targeted in gynaecological cancers include folate receptor \u03b1, sodium-dependent phosphate transport protein 2B, tissue factor (TF), mesothelin and mucin 16. \n\nThe payload is usually represented by small cytotoxic molecules measuring 300-1,000 daltons; agents with significant efficacy are auristatin and maytansine, both potent microtubule inhibitors. 9 Among auristatins, monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE/vedotin) has shown a bystander effect on neighbouring cells owing to its ability to cross cell membranes. Monomethyl auristatin F (MMAF/mafodotin), however, did not show the same activity. Among maytansines, we distinguish emtansine, mertansine, soravtansine and ravtansine. \n\nThe linker is fundamental to the stability of ADCs in the bloodstream,",

            "text": "Antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) are monoclonal antibodies designed to deliver a cytotoxic drug selectively to antigen expressing cells. Several components of an ADC including the selection of the antibody, the linker, the cytotoxic drug payload and the site of attachment used to attach the drug to the antibody are critical to the activity and development of the ADC. The cytotoxic drugs or payloads used to make ADCs are typically conjugated to the antibody through cysteine or lysine residues. This results in ADCs that have a heterogeneous number of drugs per antibody. The number of drugs per antibody commonly referred to as the drug to antibody ratio (DAR), can vary between 0 and 8 drugs for a IgG1 antibody. Antibodies with 0 drugs are ineffective and compete with the ADC for binding to the antigen expressing cells. Antibodies with 8 drugs per antibody have reduced in vivo stability, which may contribute to non target related toxicities. In these studies we incorporated a non-natural amino acid, para acetyl phenylalanine, at two unique sites within an antibody against Her2/neu. We covalently attached a cytotoxic drug to these sites to form an ADC which contains two drugs per antibody. We report the results from the first direct preclinical comparison of a site specific non-natural amino acid anti-Her2 ADC and a cysteine conjugated anti-Her2 ADC. We report that the site specific non-natural amino acid anti-Her2 ADCs have superior in vitro serum stability and preclinical toxicology profile in rats as compared to the cysteine conjugated anti-Her2 ADCs. We also demonstrate that the site specific non-natural amino acid anti-Her2 ADCs maintain their in vitro potency and in vivo efficacy against Her2 expressing human tumor cell lines. Our data suggests that site specific non-natural amino acid ADCs may have a superior therapeutic window than cysteine conjugated ADCs.",

Anti-CD30 and anti-CD19 antibodies, cAC10 and hBU12, respectively, were conjugated as previously described (17). Briefly, a solution of antibody around 10 mg/mL in PBS (pH 7.4) containing 1 mmol/L EDTA was treated with 12 equivalents of tris(2-carboxy-ethyl)phosphine (TCEP) to achieve full reduction of the four interchain disulfides. Reduction progress was monitored by reversed-phase chromatography and additional TCEP was added as needed to complete the reaction. Upon reaction completion, the reduced antibody solution was purified by three rounds of 10-fold dilution and centrifugation at 4,000 \u00c2 g through a 30-kDa molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) filter.\n\nFully reduced antibody as a PBS solution containing 1 mmol/L EDTA and buffered with 100 mmol/L potassium phosphate to pH 7.4 was conjugated with 10 molar equivalents (25% excess) of drug-linker as a 10 mmol/L DMSO stock. The resulting solution was vortexed and left at room temperature for 15 to 30 minutes. The extent of conjugation was assessed by reversed-phase chromatography and additional drug-linker was added as needed. Once all eight available mAb cysteines were alkylated, the crude ADC solution was purified by three rounds of 10-fold dilution with PBS and centrifugation at 4,000 \u00c2 g through a 30-kDa MWCO filter. The extent of aggregation was assessed by size exclusion chromatography (SEC), and in all cases, monomeric ADCs were obtained with less than 2% aggregation. The SEC chromatograms revealed a shift to shorter retention times as the PEG length in the drug-linker increased, indicative of an increase in apparent ADC size ( Supplementary Fig. S1). The resulting DAR MC-PEG 24 n = 1, n = 0, 8 homogeneous ADCs were sterile-filtered through a 0.22-mm centrifugal filter and stored at \u00c080 C.",

            "text": "ADCs are one of the fast-growing classes of anticancer agents which comprise mAbs conjugated to cytotoxic payloads via synthetic linkers. The central idea behind ADC designs is to improve the therapeutic index (the ratio of the maximum tolerated to the minimally efficacious doses) which is generally low for cytotoxic drugs used in conventional chemotherapy. As such, the mAb is used as a specific carrier for optimal delivery of the cytotoxic payload to targeted cancer cells, while leaving normal cells relatively unscathed, which typically involves the following steps: ADC binding to the antigen on targeted cancer cells, internalization, and deconjugation/degradation in the endolysosomal system releasing the payload into the cytoplasm. The linker plays an important role in the optimal payload delivery. It allows an efficient release of the payload following internalization, while ensuring the ADC stability in off-target tissues such that the ADC is maintained in a nontoxic state. The majority of payloads utilized in ADCs are highly potent, often cytotoxic in the picomolar range, as only a small fraction (< 1-2%) of the dose localizes to the cancer cells (1)(2)(3). However, because of their potencies, payloads by far drive the toxicities of ADCs (4). Although the concept of ADCs is relatively straightforward, there are significant challenges at various aspects of ADC development compared to single-component drug entities, such as small molecular drugs and monoclonal antibody biologics. One of these areas is the PK characterization of ADCs, especially when a comparative PK analysis is performed to determine the impact of a specific design change, such as adoption of a new mAb, linker, or conjugation process, relative to the desired disposition characteristics. \n\nTypical PK characterization of ADCs remains fragmented using separate NCA of individual analytes related to its conjugated or unconjugated components, as if these analytes were not related (5)(6)(7)(8)(9), providing no or little insight into the dynamic relationships between the ADC components.",

            "text": "Unfortunately, the random conjugation processes produce a diverse population of ADCs with a wide distribution of drug molecules per antibody (Wang et al., 2005). The structural heterogeneity in overall charge can impact solubility, stability, efficacy, and potentially increase off-target toxicity (Junutula et al., 2008). Moreover, there were studies concluded that ADCs loaded with 2-4 drug molecules per mAb achieved the best balance between slow clearance and maximal potency (Peters and Brown, 2015). Furthermore, research had demonstrated that ADCs with a payload conjugated to the light chain of the mAb were shown to perform significantly higher in vivo efficacy compared with those conjugated to the heavy chain (Shen et al., 2012). On the other hand, noncleavable linkers are intended to be more stable in the bloodstream and extracellular space, because ADCs release their toxins relying on the internalization and lysosomal degradation (DeVay et al., 2017;Peters and Brown, 2015;Ritchie et al., 2013). Therefore, ADC efficacy depends in part on antibody-antigen interaction at the cell surface triggering the internalization and lysosomal trafficking. In the present work, the LDM-derived apoprotein LDP was fused with the Nterminal of light chain of the anti-CD30 antibody through a noncleavable linker, so the resulting anti-CD30-LDM contained exactly two LDM molecules per antibody. Furthermore, the results showed that fusion protein anti-CD30-LDP has high-binding activity to CD30 antigen and can be internalized into CD30 + tumor cells. The fusion of LDP to anti-CD30 antibody had no effect on the activity of parent anti-CD30 antibody. Anti-CD30-LDM displayed potent cytotoxicity to cancer cells in vitro. These results suggested that our design for generating novel types of ADC is both rational and feasible. \n\nIn this study, we generated the new ADC by a novel two-step method according to the attractive property of the lidamycin which can be dissociated and reconstituted in vitro (Tanaka et al., 2001).",

Because the metabolic product contains the payload linked to an antibody-derived amino acid, it is vital that the payload retain activity even with the added bulk and charge. In one comparison of linker types, it was found that ADCs containing a non-cleavable linker had similar potency, but a higher therapeutic window, than the corresponding ADCs containing a protease-cleavable linker. 233 In addition to chemical reactivity, the physicochemical properties of the linker as a whole should also be considered. Since ADCs contain more hydrophobic surface area than naked antibodies, they are generally more prone to aggregation. 230 Additionally, hydrophobic drugs are more likely to be substrates for the transporter MDR1. 61 Therefore, polar linkers that contain solubilizing groups like sulfonate and PEG not only reduce ADC aggregation propensity, but also potentiate elimination of MDR1-expressing cells (assuming the polar functionality is retained in the final warhead). 234,235 As a result, properties like potency, pharmacokinetics, and therapeutic index can all be improved by using charged or polar linkers. 236 Presence of charge in the final drug moiety also largely determines its ability to elicit the bystander effect, as only uncharged molecules efficiently cross lipid membranes to reach neighboring cells. Whereas S-methyl metabolites originating from disulfide linkers are uncharged and therefore enable bystander killing, amino acid-conjugated payloads with noncleavable linkers are charged and less likely to elicit these effects. 237,238 It should be noted that toxicity to neighboring cells can be favorable (in the case of targeting tumors with heterogenous antigen expression) or unfavorable (when the primary casualties are healthy cells).",

Conjugation of both prodrugs did not affect 7D9 binding, and all 3 ADCs exhibited anti-proliferative activity against OVCAR3 cancer cells in vitro, but their efficacy differed significantly in vivo [46]. \n\nIn vivo, cleavable 7D9-mc-vc-PAB-MMAE was more efficacious than both MMAF ADCs against OVCAR3 tumors [46]. Their in vivo potency is ranked as follows: 7D9mc-vc-PAB-MMAE>7D9-mc-vc-PAB-MMAF>7D9-mc-MMAF. The uncleavable maleimidocaproyl-MMAF (mc-MMAF) was least potent. This may be due to its lysosomal metabolite Cys-mc-MMAF having a slower diffusion into the cytoplasm to exert cytotoxic effects than the free MMAF or MMAE resulting from the valine-citrulline cleavage. The most potent ADC is 7D9-mc-vc-PAB-MMAE since its lysosomal metabolite, the free MMAE, has the ability to kill neighboring cells. In contrast, the free MMAF has poor membrane permeability and is lacking a bystander effect. Therefore, the humanized 7D9 antibody (h7D9.v3) was conjugated to MMAE via the protease-sensitive cleavable linker mc-vc-PAB and selected for development. \n\nThe h7D9.v3 antibody retained high affinity for mesothelin binding, ranging from 0.4 to 3 nM as measured by Scatchard analysis of 0.5+ to 3+ mesothelin-expressing cells.

            "text": "Monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) is the most popular and widely used cytotoxin in the development of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). However, current MMAE-based ADCs are all constructed using cleavable linkers, and this design concept still has insurmountable drawbacks. Their potential instabilities and lipophilic MMAE-induced \u201cbystander effect\u201d inevitably increase the toxicity to normal tissues. Herein, we overturn previous negative views of MMAE-based ADCs with non-cleavable linkers and propose using ionized L-Cysteine (Cys)-linker-MMAE as a novel payload, which can ingeniously enrich and enter tumor cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis of antibodies while its lower permeability helps to avoid further off-target toxicity. We demonstrate that Cys-linker-MMAE maintains high potency similar to free MMAE at the tubulin molecular level and can also be efficiently released in target cells. As a result, the preferred ADC (mil40-15) not only exhibits ideal plasma stability and maintains potent cytotoxicity as MMAE (IC50: 10\u221211 M), but also shows improved safety with lower bystander toxicity (IC50: 10\u22129 M), its maximum tolerated dose approaching the level of the naked antibody (160 mg/kg). This study indicated that Cys-linker-MMAE has the potential as a potent payload for ADCs, which is expected to provide novel strategies for the development of MMAE-based ADCs.",

Frequent toxicities that may be driven by any of the components of an ADC have been reported. There are currently more than 50 ADCs in active clinical development, and a further \u223c20 that have been discontinued. For this review, the reported toxicities of ADCs were analysed, and the mechanisms for their effects are explored in detail. Methods to reduce toxicities, including dosing strategies and drug design, are discussed. The toxicities reported for active and discontinued drugs are important to drive the rational design and improve the therapeutic index of ADCs of the future.",

            "text": "Overexpression of B7-H3 has been associated with tumor progression, metastasis, and poor clinical outcomes in various malignancies [14][15][16]. In contrast, B7-H3 expression is limited in normal tissues [15,17], sparking considerable interest in evaluating B7-H3 as a biomarker for targeted therapy. \n\nAntibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are a class of cancer therapeutics consisting of a monoclonal antibody, linkers, and a toxic payload (toxin), each of which is crucial for ADC efficiency and safety [18,19]. ADCs enable the selective delivery of cytotoxic drugs to targeted tumor tissues, thereby enhancing the therapeutic window by selectively administering cytotoxic drugs to target cells [20]. Typically, the chosen toxin induces apoptosis via microtubule inhibition or DNA damage, subsequently eliminating surrounding cancer cells through the bystander effect [21]. Moreover, the choice of linker and toxin significantly influences the stability and efficacy of ADCs [22]. Mylotarg (gemtuzumab ozogamicin), the first ADC drug, was approved by the United States FDA in 2000. Over the past two decades, 14 ADCs have been introduced to the market, reflecting a growing trend in ADC clinical development [23]. Unfortunately, while three B7-H3 ADCs are currently undergoing clinical trials, none have received approval. \n\nPrevious research demonstrated that the microtubuledisrupting agent monomethyl auristatin F (MMAF) can be conjugated to an anti-B7-H3 monoclonal antibody using two different linker types: the Ortho Hydroxy-Protected Aryl Sulfate (OHPAS) linker and the valinecitrulline-p-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl (VC-PABC) linker [24][25][26]. The resulting ADC with the OHPAS linker exhibited stability in mouse and IgG-depleted human plasma, while the ADC with the VC-PABC linker displayed instability in mouse plasma [24].",

Among the seven approved ADCs, four of the ADCs, namely brentuximab vedotin, polatuzumab vedotin, enfortumab vedotin and trastuzumab deruxtecan, included both ADC conjugate and unconjugated drug analytes in their ER analyses. A positive exposure-efficacy relationship with ADC conjugate exposure was consistently observed for the four ADCs, however, no apparent or negative exposure-efficacy relationship was observed for unconjugated drug exposure. In comparison, exposure-safety relationships for the four ADCs vary, depending on safety endpoints and analytes used in the analyses. For brentuximab vedotin and enfortumab vedotin, ADC conjugate exposure appeared to correlate better with safety than that of unconjugated drug. In the case of brentuximab vedotin, a positive exposure-safety relationship was observed with ADC conjugate exposure, but not with that of unconjugated drug, while for enfortumab vedotin, positive exposure-safety relationships were observed with exposure of both ADC conjugate and unconjugated drug, but the strengthen of exposure-safety relationship appears to be much weaker for unconjugated drug.

This advanced therapeutic approach addresses many challenges of traditional chemotherapy. 10 ADC payloads are designed to be highly potent, often active at picomolar concentrations, to counter the fact that only a small fraction of injected antibodies effectively reach tumor cells. ][26] The linker between the payload and the antibody is crucial for ADC effectiveness. It controls the release of the cytotoxic drug, directly impacting pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and the therapeutic index. A stable linker ensures controlled drug release at the target site, minimizing off-target effects. However, the stability of the linker must be carefully balanced: a too-weak linker may cause premature drug release, while an overly strong linker may hinder drug delivery. ADCs use both cleavable and non-cleavable linkers. Cleavable linkers respond to specific enzymatic conditions within endosomes, releasing the drug payload upon cleavage. Non-cleavable linkers rely on lysosomal degradation for drug release. 27,28 This sophisticated design allows ADCs to precisely target and destroy cancer cells while minimizing damage to healthy tissues.",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates comprise three elements: a mAb, a linker, and a cytotoxic drug. Each of these components undergoes distinct metabolic changes. [1,29] Some linkers are processed intracellularly to release the cytotoxic drug, by a reduction in disulfide bonds mediated by glutathione in the cytoplasm, exposure to acidic conditions in the lysosome, or cleavage by specific proteases. The so-called non-cleavable linkers, that maintain better stability in systemic circulation, rely on degradation of the mAb to release their payload. Antibody-drug conjugates are not a homogenous solution. [29] After the administration, ADCs are being distributed and metabolized. The ADC is expected to be catabolized as a protein with component amino acids recycled or eliminated. Owing to their complex structure, bioanalysis should include the conjugated antibody, the total antibody, the antibody-conjugated drug, the unconjugated drug, and possibly its metabolites including or not part of the linker. [30] Another vital component of the ADC therapeutic system are anti-drug antibodies (ADAs). All these parameters might impact the exposure-response effect relationship. Based on a population-pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis, following intravenous administration, the central volume of distribution of all ADCs equals approximately that of plasma volume, owing to the big molecular weight of the conjugates.

            "text": "Before we move towards the various cargos that are being explored for ADCs, we will briefly summarize recent advances in conjugation techniques and linker designs. Both aspects play a key role in ADC stability, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic [58,59]. Relevant parameters for the conjugation strategy are the site-of-attachment, the drug-to-antibody ratio and stability in biological matrices (Fig. 3). While stability is an important design feature of linkers, further aspects like solubility, release mechanisms and multivalency are being considered as relevant for the potency and safety of ADCs. In this section we highlight how researchers have implemented these features in recently developed conjugation methods and linker designs. For a comprehensive overview of site-selective modification strategies for ADCs we would like to bring your attention to a very recent review by Walsh et al. [60] and a detailed and comprehensive review of cleavable linkers can be found in a 2019 review by Bargh et al. [61]. \n\nCurrently approved ADCs exclusively use amine-or thiol-directed conjugation for drug attachment. In these cases, drugs are attached to surface exposed lysine residues or reduced intrachain-disulfides, respectively. By targeting endogenous residues, no engineering of the antibody is necessary. However, the site of attachment and the number of attached molecules is hard to control, leading to a heterogenous product containing multiple ADC species of varying DARs. Furthermore, cysteine conjugation via maleimides poses the risk for hydrolysis and thiolexchange to endogenous proteins in biological matrices [62,63]. These aspects are considered to negatively affect the potency and safety of the conjugates [63][64][65].",

            "text": "Nevertheless, the concept of an ADc is compelling, and hundreds of ADcs have been built, studied, and tested. Since Mylotarg's first approval, 15 ADcs have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of both solid and hematological cancers (table 1, Sasso et al. 2023)-including Mylotarg which returned to the market in 2017 with a lower suggested dose and a revised dosing schedule-and over 100 ADcs are currently in clinical trials, with more than 200 ADcs in preclinical development. \n\nwhat we have learned over two decades of research, is that each component of an ADc (the antibody, linker, and payload) confers pharmacokinetics and biodistribution properties that provide more on-target activity, but also a concomitant exposure to the rest of the body that results in off-target toxicities (colombo and Rich 2022; Sasso et al. 2023). to expand the therapeutic window, much research has been devoted to the development of cleavable and non-cleavable linkers that improve the stability, hydrophobicity, and specific release of the cytotoxic payloads. ideally, linkers are stable in circulation and release payload in cancer cells. to achieve this dual functionality, linkers with diverse release triggers have been developed including pH sensitive linkers, enzyme cleavable linkers (i.e. specifically cleaved by cathepsins, glycosidases, or sulfatases), and photo-sensitive linkers. the unique properties of these linkers convey functionality to ADcs, but an in-depth analysis of these is beyond the scope of this review (Su et al. 2021). in addition, a collection of different cytotoxins with various mechanisms of action and potencies have been used to reduce off-target effects (Beck et al. 2017). A critical consideration when designing an ADc is how protein engineering and the chemistry of conjugation can determine the individual components of the conjugate, and consequently, affect its overall stability, PK, efficacy, and safety. Here we discuss advances in protein engineering strategies and emerging technologies that are being developed to improve the functional properties of ADcs.",

Understanding the metabolism and disposition of ADCs and interpreting exposure-efficacy and exposure-safety relationships of ADCs in the context of their various catabolites is critical for design and subsequent development of a clinically successful ADCs. Sophisticated bioanalytical assays are required for the assessments of intact ADC, total antibody, released warhead and relevant metabolites. Both ligand-binding assays (LBA) and hybrid LBA-liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LBA-LC-MS/MS) methods have been employed to assess pharmacokinetics (PK) of ADCs. Future advances in bioanalytical techniques will need to address the rising complexity of this biotherapeutic modality as more innovative conjugation strategies, antibody scaffolds and novel classes of warheads are employed for the next generation of ADCs. This review reflects our considerations on ADME of ADCs and provides a perspective on the current bioanalytical strategies for pharmacokinetic assessments of ADCs.",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) as a therapeutic modality has received renewed interest in this decade due to recent clinical successes. 1 ADC achieves targeted drug delivery by combining potency of cytotoxic drugs with target selectivity of monoclonal antibodies. 2 The antibody recognizes the target antigen, binds, and is then internalized into cells. The linker provides for controlled release of cytotoxic drugs. \n\nADCs may undergo structural changes in circulation or in tissues. The antibody portion may experience proteolysis or amino acid modifications such as deamidation and oxidation, which is common to other protein therapeutics. 3 The linker and payload moieties may undergo changes that directly affect their safety and efficacy. For example, nonspecific payload release may result in undesired toxicity. The released payload components from ADC are subject to small molecule metabolism by enzymes in the liver such as CYP450s. 3 ypically, conjugated linker-payload remains quite stable in circulation due to limited exposure to metabolizing enzymes. However, biotransformations can still occur on the conjugated linker-payload. One reported example is thiosuccinimide ring hydrolysis commonly observed on cysteine conjugated ADCs. Once thiosuccinimide is hydrolyzed, the linker-payload is no longer subject to elimination through retro-Michael reaction and thus prevents nonspecific deconjugation. 4,5 Another reported biotransformation is hydrolysis on the payload structure. 6 Other observed changes to linker-payload are cleavages or partial loss, such as hydrazone cleavage, peptide bond cleavage, carbamate cleavage, disulfide cleavage, etc. 3 In summary, the biotransformation of conjugated payload can be very different from released payload or small molecules due to inherent distribution differences, enabling exposure to different compartments and enzymes. \n\nAssessing biotransformation of conjugated payload is important for evaluating whether the biotransformed payload component may still be active. 7 Overall, ADC biotransformation information is valuable for understanding in vivo stability and pharmacokinetics for guiding drug design.",

            "text": "The impact of drug loading and distribution on higher order structure and physical stability of an interchain cysteine-based antibody drug conjugate (ADC) has been studied. An IgG1 mAb was conjugated with a cytotoxic auristatin payload following the reduction of interchain disulfides. The 2-D LC-MS analysis shows that there is a preference for certain isomers within the various drug to antibody ratios (DARs). The physical stability of the unconjugated monoclonal antibody, the ADC, and isolated conjugated species with specific DAR, were compared using calorimetric, thermal, chemical denaturation and molecular modeling techniques, as well as techniques to assess hydrophobicity. The DAR was determined to have a significant impact on the biophysical properties and stability of the ADC. The CH2 domain was significantly perturbed in the DAR6 species, which was attributable to quaternary structural changes as assessed by molecular modeling. At accelerated storage temperatures, the DAR6 rapidly forms higher molecular mass species, whereas the DAR2 and the unconjugated mAb were largely stable. Chemical denaturation study indicates that DAR6 may form multimers while DAR2 and DAR4 primarily exist in monomeric forms in solution at ambient conditions. The physical state differences were correlated with a dramatic increase in the hydrophobicity and a reduction in the surface tension of the DAR6 compared to lower DAR species. Molecular modeling of the various DAR species and their conformers demonstrates that the auristatin-based linker payload directly contributes to the hydrophobicity of the ADC molecule. Higher order structural characterization provides insight into the impact of conjugation on the conformational and colloidal factors that determine the physical stability of cysteine-based ADCs, with implications for process and formulation development.",

Antibody-drug conjugates combine the ultimate possessions of both antibodies and drugs to target precisely the tumor cells. Antibody monotherapy often lacks elevated therapeutic index and limits immune induction, alternatively, antibodies can be joined with cytotoxic drugs to efficiently reduce systematic toxicity and enhance targeted delivery to tumor cells (Dal Corso et al., 2018). Various cytotoxic conjugated agents are now in clinical use as calicheamicin and duocarmycin (DNA alkylation agents), auristatin and maytansinoids (microtubules disruption mediators), and DNA binding anthracyclines (Beck and Reichert, 2014). \n\nGenerally, lysine and cysteine sulfhydryl chains help in the conjugation of drugs to antibodies by reducing disulfide bonds in the development of antibody-drug conjugates (ADC). This heterogeneity facilitates binding of 2, 4 and 8 drug residues to targeted antibody and was reported in vivo potency in mice model. The antibody loaded with the maximum number of drugs might be rapidly clear showing low potency and instability or disruption. The consistency of ADC and its counterpart is laborious work to control potency in vivo studies. Four different ADC molecules were approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and more than 100 ADC molecules are in clinical evaluation to treat the solid tumor (Lambert and Morris, 2017;Yu et al., 2015). Successful optimization of ADC depends on the selection of antibodies, the stability of linkers and potency of toxic drugs consequently to enhance tumor suppression. Additionally, the developmental progress of ADC depends extensively on better knowledge of antibody components of ADC and its trafficking in the intracellular region of targeted tumor cells (Dal Corso et al., 2018). Several studies indicate that engineered antibody can be utilized to exploit the endosomal pathways that provide a substantial clove for future studies and better designing of ADC (Kalim et al., 2017).",

            "text": "ADCs hold the promise of revolutionizing cancer treatment by increasing antitumour efficacy while overcoming the collateral damage associated with conventional chemotherapeutic drugs via targeted delivery. Although the approvals of ado-trastuzumab emtansine and brentuximab vedotin in this decade have set the tone for the future of ADCs, 1 adverse effects are known to occur before the optimal therapeutic dose is reached with these drugs, hence limiting their clinical outcome. In order to widen the therapeutic window, strategies involving target selection, innovative linker technologies and payload potency need to   evolve to design the ideal \"magic bullet\". Here we report a novel Pt(II) based linker that re-bridges the antibody chains post reduction and provides a facile alternative to address the key issues of ADC linkers. The presence of strong interactions between the antibody chains in the Pt-based ADC preserves the higher order structural stability when compared to the maleimide-based ADC, in which non-covalent forces exist as elucidated with three different antibodies. The labile C-S bond in the case of maleimide, is overcome by the strength of the Pt-S interaction imparting the necessary stability to the ADC. Additionally, for any IgG1, the location of inter-chain cysteines is conserved and hence, the attachment of the linker-drug is site-speci\ue103c and the high efficiency of the Pt-S reaction ensures that the resulting ADC is homogeneous.\n\nWhile the premature release of the linker-drug from the antibody would result in off-target effects, a very stable linker would be non-efficacious. Thus, careful selection and subsequent optimization of the payload and linker-payload combination is required to generate ADCs with maximal therapeutic efficacy. Another crucial factor for achieving success at the clinic is the requirement for the production of homogeneous ADCs, which may even become a prerequisite for future FDA approvals. However, ADCs prepared through conventional linker technologies, such as conjugation to lysines of the antibody, exhibit heterogeneity with multiple species, which is addressed by the Pt-based re-bridging of the disul\ue103des on de\ue103ned cysteines.

            "text": "The biological molecules known as linkers used in ADCs are for the linkage between the antibody and the warhead. Effective linkers must ensure ADC stability in the circulation as well as efficient cleavage upon internalization by the tumor cells. Since premature drug release into the blood might increase in systemic toxicity with consequent reduced therapeutic index, effective linker design must achieve an equilibrium between the necessity for long-term stability in the circulation and effective cleavage upon internalization into the target cell (59,60). There has been significant progress in linker technology since the beginning of ADC research, which has contributed enormously to the clinical achievements of ADC formulations until now (60). For linkers, there are both noncleavable and cleavable linkers that ensure the requirements of ADC design mentioned above. Non-cleavable linkers are made up of stable bonds e.g., non-reducible thioether linkage (SMCC), maleimidocaproyl linkage etc. that can withstand the proteolytic degradation inside the cytosol and release of cytotoxic payloads only occurs after antigen-specific internalization of the conjugate and full breakdown of mAb by lysosomal proteolytic degradation (12,14,20). Thus, the resultant release of the cytotoxic drugs is linked to the antibody's linker and an amino acid residue, which specifically kills tumor cells and doesn't release at non-target locations to cause any damage to healthy cells. Additionally, the non-cleavable linkers have provision to modify the chemical characteristics of small molecules to enhance the affinity of the transporter and increase its effectiveness. Although they have lesser membrane permeability, these linkers are more stable than cleavable ones and increase the therapeutic window by minimizing the off-target toxicities. Examples of non-cleavable linkers include thioether linkers (used in T-DM1) and maleimidebased linkers (used in belantamab mafodotin) (61).",

            "text": "ADCs can be taxonomically classified into three generations based on their constituent components and methodologies. The first generation principally encompasses conventional chemotherapeutic agents, mouse-derived antibodies, and non-cleavable linkers, which are plagued by numerous limitations including unstable linkers, antibody aggregation, and heterogeneous agents. The second-generation ADCs leverage IgG1 isotype monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), cytotoxic payloads with increased potency, and optimized linkers, collectively enhancing the therapeutic index of these conjugates. The third generation features precisely characterized drug-to-antibody ratios (DARs) of either 2 or 4 and deploys fully humanized antibodies to minimize immunogenicity [73]. Collectively, advancements in ADCs are highly contingent upon the iterative optimization of these components. However, due to the large molecular weight of ADC compared with other cytotoxic drugs, the efficiency of drug penetration remains a limitation [73]. Current research foci include the identification of novel targets, introduction of polyclonal antibodies, and the design of payloads with greater tumor-specific toxicity and enhanced stability. As for linkers, the emphasis is on developing ones that degrade selectively within neoplastic tissues, sparing normal cells.",

            "text": "There are currently four clinically approved antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) in the market, directed against both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. ADCs utilize highly potent cytotoxic payloads, originally discovered as having anti-tumor activity, but then proven to be too toxic for human use in the form of small-molecule drugs. However, utilizing tumor-specific antibodies as targeting vehicles and development of sophisticated linker technologies has since enabled clinical use of these potent anticancer compounds [1]. That being said, the therapeutic window of ADCs is still quite narrow and many clinical programs have suffered from unwanted toxicity and insufficient efficacy against tumors. Therefore, development of more safe and efficacious ADC technology with a wider therapeutic window remains a viable field of study. It has been established that ADCs with higher drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) have greater in vitro potency than the current clinically approved ADCs with DAR of about four, and the higher DAR ADCs are especially effective against cells with low copy numbers of the target antigen [2]. However, DAR = 8 monomethylauristatin E (MMAE) ADCs are inferior to both DAR = 2 and DAR = 4 ADCs in vivo due to their poor in vivo pharmacokinetics and systemic exposure [2,3]. Further studies have convincingly demonstrated that this effect was due to the hydrophobic character of the current ADC payloads and that by masking the hydrophobic payloads by hydrophilic linker moieties DAR = 8 ADCs with improved in vivo biodistribution and efficacy can be achieved [4]. \n\nWe took another line of study and reasoned that the same effect could be achieved by transient hydrophilic modification of the payload itself. We synthesized hydrophilic glycoside-modified versions of common small-molecule hydrophobic ADC payloads to make them more hydrophilic. In the present study we describe novel glycosides of the tubulin polymerization inhibitor MMAE that has a hydroxyl functional group useful for substitution with O-glycosidic linkage (Figure 1).",

This includes, but is not limited to, antibody engineering to facilitate direct site-specific conjugation, modification of conjugation chemistry and introduction of novel linker compositions to confer enhanced stability, as well as, the exploration of additional existing and novel chemical entities/modalities as conjugates to increase the pharmacological applications of ADCs. Many of these advancements to design better molecules are intricately interdependent with optimizing or improving the ADME drug-ability properties of ADCs, such as linker-payload stability, distribution, and pharmacokinetics (PK). This is because defining the exposure-response relationship for both safety and efficacy has been intimately tied with ADC peripheral PK, target tissue or site of action concentration and the disposition of the payload at the intended site.

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have begun to fulfil their promise as targeted cancer therapeutics with ten clinical approvals to date. As the field matures, much attention has focused upon the key factors required to produce safe and efficacious ADCs. Recently the role that linker-payload reagent design has on the properties of ADCs has been highlighted as an important consideration for developers. We have investigated the effect of incorporating hydrophilic macrocycles into reagent structures on the in vitro and in vivo behavior of ADCs. Bis-sulfone based disulfide rebridging reagents bearing Val-Cit-PABC-MMAE linker-payloads were synthesized with a panel of cyclodextrins and crown ethers integrated into their structures via a glutamic acid branching point. Brentuximab was selected as a model antibody and ten ADCs with a drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) of 4 were prepared for biological evaluation. In vitro, the ADCs prepared showed broadly similar potency (range: 16\u201334 pM) and were comparable to Adcetris\u00ae (16 pM). In vivo, the cyclodextrin containing ADCs showed greater efficacy than Adcetris\u00ae and the most efficacious variant (incorporating a 3\u2032-amino-\u03b1-cyclodextrin component) matched a 24-unit poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) containing comparator. The ADCs bearing crown ethers also displayed enhanced in vivo efficacy compared to Adcetris\u00ae, the most active variant (containing a 1-aza-42-crown-14 macrocycle) was superior to an analogous ADC with a larger 24-unit PEG chain. In summary, we have demonstrated that hydrophilic macrocycles can be effectively incorporated into ADC reagent design and offer the potential for enhanced alternatives to established drug-linker architectures.",

Stability, drug-antibody ratio (DAR) and drug distribution have all been shown to be crucial to the efficacy, safety and overall pharmacological pro\ue103le of ADCs and are strongly in\ue104uenced by the chemistry used to attach the linker to the antibody. Commonly employed nucleophilic bioconjugation at cysteine or lysine residues are pseudorandom: in theory, any of the targeted amino acids within the antibody can be modi\ue103ed. Consequently, there is a lack of selectivity, leading to the formation of ADCs which are heterogeneous in terms of the number of cytotoxin molecules incorporated (the DAR) and their locations on the antibody. Such constructs are associated with unreliable pharmacokinetic pro\ue103les and therefore, a reduced pharmacological effect. [13][14][15][16][17] Maleimide conjugation to reduced antibody cysteine thiols has been extensively used in ADC development (Fig. 1a). However, the formed succinimide thioether is inherently unstable in the body (due to a retro-Michael reaction) which leads to premature dissociation of the payload from the antibody. 18,19 The plasma stability of maleimide-based linkers has been increased by hydrolysis of the succinimide thioether ring through linker modi\ue103cations or antibody engineering. 20,21 However, an inherently stable linker is preferential.

            "text": "The drug-antibody ratio (DAR), or number of drug molecules conjugated to a single ADC, is critical in determining efficacy. Optimal DAR to achieve the greatest clinical efficacy has yet to be determined, and may be highly dependent on other ADC variables. In addition, DAR varies within a single product, and controlling this heterogeneity is complicated, due to the number of lysine residues exposed on the antibody surface, such as for ado-trastuzumab emtansine, and the cysteine residues used in creating interchain disulfide bonds, such as for brentuximab vedotin [3]. With too few molecules attached, the ADC may not provide an adequate cytotoxic response or anti-tumor efficacy [3]. On the other hand, too many drug molecules conjugated to an ADC can become unstable, be rapidly recognized by the immune system, produce altered PK and PD properties, and increased toxicity [78]. \n\nIt has been shown previously that a higher DAR leads to greater in vitro potency, though the increased DAR also affects the pharmacological properties of the agent [78,79]. For instance, the conjugation of MMAE in the creation of ADCs, or doxorubicin in high DAR ADCs, resulted in increased aggregation, both believed to be due to their added hydrophobicity [78,80,81]. To offset the hydrophobic detriments of cytotoxic payloads, hydrophilic-based polymer linkers are being evaluated. Preliminary studies of these hydrophilic linkers show that higher DARs (up to a DAR of 20) increase potency, but also maintain the desired biological/pharmacological properties in vivo [79,82]. \n\nThere have been extensive studies on the effects of DAR on the properties of ADCs. One group prepared a series of maytansinoid-coupled ADCs with a DAR range from 2 to 14, using both cleavable and non-cleavable linkers, to evaluate the preclinical and clinical effects of DAR, including in vivo stability, efficacy, and tolerability [79,83].",

            "text": "In addition to the linker, the conjugation site can also have a significant influence on the stability of an ADC during circulation, and hence, its overall pharmacological activity. The availability of many different site-specific conjugation methods [51] has made it possible to choose suitable sites on the antibody for payload attachment. The thiol-maleimide Michael addition chemistry is a commonly used method because of its robustness and chemo-specificity. The reaction leads to a succinimide thioether linkage formed with either native or engineered cysteine residues in the antibody. However, the maleimide exchange with thiols present in certain plasma components can result in deconjugation, which negatively affects ADC efficacy and safety. The succinimide ring can also undergo hydrolysis to produce a stable linkage which cannot further undergo retro-Michael elimination and is therefore beneficial for ADC activity. Shen et al. have shown that the different solvent accessibility and chemical environment of different conjugation sites can have different effects on the above-mentioned two reactions, which in turn affects the stability and efficacy of the corresponding ADCs [52]. It is interesting to note that conjugation sitedependent payload loss in plasma was observed not only with the ValCit-PABC linkers, but also with the non-cleavable linkers. The results from this study seem to show that the decrease in DAR was due to chemical deconjugation; however, one may not completely exclude the possibility that the enzymatic cleavage of the ValCit-PABC linker also played",

The structure of this non-covalent ADC was confirmed by SDS PAGE and MS analysis, as well as by UV-Vis spectrophotometry. The in vitro test of stability in human plasma demonstrated surprisingly good stability of double-stranded DNA-antibody conjugate, which proved to be close to that of a maleimide-based ADC. \n\nIn vitro cytotoxicity assay of DNA-linked ADC T-DNA-MMAE showed successful targeting of DNA-drug payload to HER2-positive cell line and induced cell death at nanomolar concentrations (EC50 = 1.93 \u00b1 0.41 nM). This EC50 value is higher than that of covalently linked ADC T-MMAE (EC50 = 0.20 \u00b1 0.10 nM) or T-Cys-MMAE (EC50 = 0.05 \u00b1 0.02 nM), probably because of the negative charges of DNA that may affect internalization/binding or drug processing. \n\nFrom the point of view of possible therapeutic use, the effect of a DNA linker on the behavior of the conjugate appears somehow contradictory. On one hand, it reduces the toxicity of the free drug by reducing its cell  penetration, which is positive in case of premature deconjugation in the bloodstream. One the other hand, it potentially increases the off-target toxicity on low antigen-expressing cells, presumably due to nonspecific interaction of the nucleic acid-based linker with the cell surface. These latest observations might be of high interest, especially for the AOC design in the context of siRNA, or microRNA delivery. Further studies will be conducted to investigate the generality of this phenomenon.",

            "text": "After selecting all the three major components of an ADC, the overall structure also plays a role in its function. It is important to note that, selection of all three right components is tricky and any discrepancy can lead to different biophysical and functional properties of the resultant ADC (13,16,20,62,63). For example, variations in the linker could have a tremendous impact on the ADC both for biophysical and functional properties. There are two primary conjugation methods for connecting linkers to antibodies, leading in either varied or site-specific payload placement. Currently, heterogeneous conjugates dominate in ADCs that are in the clinical pipeline, despite efficient understanding of analytical benefits of site-specific conjugation. Heterogeneous ADCs have dominated the field for a long time because the methods for creating them are relatively straightforward. However, in recent years, there has been a shift towards the development of site-specific ADCs, which have a uniform drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) and specific conjugation sites. These site-specific ADCs are produced using engineered antibodies with specific conjugation sites or using enzymatic conjugation methods. Heterogeneous conjugation is dominant to site-specific conjugation for several reasons, at least: older, well known, more rapid, less expensive, not limited by a patent protecting the site-specific method. It is an active area of research to determine which approach will ultimately prove most effective in different therapeutic contexts (64). \n\nIn constructing an optimum hybrid, the DAR of ADCs is a critical attribute for their therapeutic efficacy and pharmacokinetics. Stability, solubility, antigen binding, clearance and biodistribution of an ADC can be influenced by the number of DAR in its configuration. In order to achieve adequate cytotoxicity by ADC, a certain number of linker-drug units need to be attached to each mAb. \n\nDAR is a variable trait that represents the average number of payload moieties attached to each mAb. The value of DAR in ADCs has important attributes for both pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of cytotoxic drug used in it.",

            "text": "However, the roles of these unique features in the success of SG remain unclear. \n\nSG marks a shift in common ADC design approaches, many of which focus on using highly stable, conditionally cleavable linkers with ultrapotent payloads (i.e., pmol/L IC 50 values; ref. 6). Notably, this lower payload potency enables SG to use the highest clinical dosing regimen of all FDA-approved ADCs: a 10-mg/kg dose administered on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle. The efficacy of SG has been demonstrated both preclinically (7,8) and clinically (9)(10)(11). However, the overall disposition of ADCs and their payloads are complex (Fig. 1), and several questions remain around the quantitative pharmacology of using moderately potent payloads with hydrolysable linkers, especially considering the diverging design strategy from previously approved ADCs. \n\nLinker selection is important for ADC design because it influences the threshold for toxicity and efficacy by modulating payload release in circulation, off-target tissues, and cancer cells. Ideally, a linker would release the payload efficiently and specifically in cancer cells alone. However, payloads can be released in circulation or in healthy cells after target-mediated or nonspecific accumulation in other tissues, leading to toxicity and complex pharmacokinetics. Therefore, there has been a significant effort in the ADC field to engineer more stable linkers to minimize off-target toxicity (12,13). Protease cleavable linkers are one of the most common linkers given their stability in circulation and ability to release payload upon cleavage inside cells. In contrast, SG uses a benzyl carbonate linker that can be hydrolyzed at neutral or acidic pH including in systemic circulation [half-life of payload release in human serum \u00bc 20.3 hours (8); see also supplementary discussion]. \n\nIncreased linker stability can prevent payload release in circulation and increase delivery to the tumor, because systemic release prevents targeted delivery to the tumor. However, previous results showed that the protease-cleavable linker (higher stability) was less effective than the hydrolysable linker (lower stability; refs. 14,15).",

            "text": "Ravi Chari (ImmunoGen, Inc.,) briefly reviewed the first generation ADCs that incorporated anti-cancer drugs such as methotrexate, vinblastine or doxorubicin and lessons learned from their poor activity in clinical trials. One reason for the lack of success of these early ADCs was insufficient potency of the cytotoxic drug. Because of the limited number of antigens on the cell surface, inefficient internalization processes, and the reported low tumor localization of antibodies in patients, Dr. Chari suggested that effector molecules should have potency in the 10 -10 to 10 -11 M range. He discussed the suitability of several drug classes that have been considered for ADCs, including morpholinodoxorubicins, calicheamicins, CC-1065 analogs and duocarmycins, dolastatin analogs and maytansinoids and highlighted the importance of potency, aqueous solubility and stability. \n\nDr. Chari then described ImmunoGen's maytansinoid (DM1 or DM4) and linker platform (thioether linker SMCC or disulfide linkers SPP, SPDB) and explained how they allow a modular approach to selection of the best antibody-maytansinoid conjugate (AMC) product for a given target. The in vivo tumor metabolites from AMCs were identified and characterized. Although AMCs with a non-cleavable thioether linker showed greater metabolite accumulation at the tumor in vivo, they often showed lower anti-tumor activity. The higher activity of AMCs Christoph Uherek (Biotest) presented preclinical and clinical data on BT-062, an anti-CD138 antibody-maytansinoid conjugate for the treatment of multiple myeloma. CD138 represents a good ADC target because it is expressed in a vast majority of multiple myeloma patients, but not expressed on healthy blood or bone marrow cells. Three different linker/maytansinoid combinations were evaluated in preclinical studies.",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are a novel class of therapeutic agents consisting of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) covalently bound with a cytotoxic drug through a chemical linker. The mAb preferentially targets cell surface antigens overexpressed in tumor cells. Upon binding, the ADC is internalized by the tumor cell, where it undergoes lysosomal degradation, leading to the release of the cytotoxic drug. The use of targeted delivery of highly potent cytotoxic drugs is designed to enhance the antitumor activity while minimizing the toxicity in normal tissues. Additionally, this therapeutic approach takes advantage of the favorable pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of the antibody to provide a sustained delivery of the cytotoxic drug. \n\nMany ADCs in clinical development use a protease-labile dipeptide linker (valine-citrulline [vc]), conjugated to monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) via solvent-accessible thiols present in mAb cysteines (vc-MMAE ADC). 1 A representative structure of a vc-MMAE ADC is shown in Figure 1. 2 Conjugation through reduced inter-chain disulfide cysteine residues results in a heterogeneous mixture of conjugated antibodies, with even-numbered drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) species of 0, 2, 4, 6 or 8. The average DARs for most of vc-MMAE ADCs in clinical development are approximately 3-4. In 2011, the United States Food and Drug Administration approved a vc-MMAE ADC, brentuximab vedotin (ADCETRIS\u2122) for the treatment of relapsed anaplastic large cell lymphoma and Hodgkin's lymphoma. 3 iven the complex structure of ADCs, which contain both large and small molecule components, and the mixture of various DAR species in the dosing solution, the PK of ADCs are expected to be complex. ADCs are expected to be cleared through two major pathways: proteolytic degradation and deconjugation. 4,5",

Impurities can reduce potency of the molecule and lead to increased toxicities that can affect patient safety. An enzymatic deconjugation approach was developed for the characterization of the small molecule drug linked to ADCs. Papain, a cysteine protease, was found to cleave the drug from the valine-citrulline linker completely during incubation with our model ADC. The papain digestion approach demonstrated excellent specificity, robustness, and accuracy, and therefore can be used for quantitation purposes. Our study also showed that papain can cleave the valine-citrulline linker on ADCs composed of antibodies and drugs that are different from those in the model ADC, demonstrating the general application of this deconjugation approach to ADCs that incorporate the same linker. This method was also used to study the purity and stability of the small molecule drug conjugated to the model ADC, and the  results provided valuable information about the impurity profile and degradation pathway of the small molecule drug conjugated to the ADC. This enzymatic deconjugation approach is thus a new tool for characterizing the payload on ADC molecules, and, as the method demonstrated excellent specificity, precision and accuracy, it may be valuable for the assessment of ADC product quality.",

            "text": "These species usually elute earlier than the parent molecule. For heavy chain species, the parent heavy chain (with 3 payloads, HC-3PL) eluted around 5.6 min, with the biotransformed species eluting around 5.4 (HC-2PL) and 5.3 min (HC-1PL), respectively (Figure 2B). Note that the degree of deconjugation on LC for all ADCs is consistently low (<0.4%) compared to HC (Figure 3B). \n\nDeconjugation of thio-succinimide-conjugated linker-payloads can result from two possible reactions: (1) retro-Michael elimination at the conjugation site, exposing the free thiol; and (2) stepwise linker cleavage, generating a series of antibody backbone species with partial linker moieties. In the evaluation of ADCs 1\u22124, only species consistent with reaction 1 deconjugation were observed. Therefore, the deconjugation and thio-succinimide hydrolysis processes for ADCs 1\u22124 are two competing reactions. There is a clear structure\u2212stability relationship and in vivo biotransformation reaction preference observed between the ADCs with propionyl-PEG8 vs caproyl spacer within the linker. This provides a mechanistic basis for improved in vivo DAR stability for ADC1 (AZD8205) and ADC4 versus ADC2 and ADC3. \n\nRelative Quantification of Biotransformed Species. The observed change in ADC DAR postdose enables the evaluation of ADC deconjugation over time. The DAR can be calculated by comparing the total Ab and ADC data from the absolute LBA-LC-MRM quantification (Figure S9A), or with the identified LC and HC species from relative quantification using intact LBA-LC-HRMS (Figures 2 and 3, and Figure S9B). It is notable that both methods, to various extent, showed that ADC1 and 4 had a slower deconjugation rate over time compared to ADC2 and 3.",

However, this approach led to these antibodies being recognized as foreign by the human immune system, which in turn produced human anti-mouse antibodies, resulting in the rapid elimination of these ADCs from the human body. Moreover, the linkers were not sufficiently stable in the bloodstream, contributing to the ADCs having a brief duration of action. Additionally, the cytotoxic agents sometimes failed to achieve the required levels of efficacy due to their insufficient toxicity in place at the administered dosages [101][102][103]. This early phase was exemplified by the launch of the first human clinical trial for an ADC in 1983, which involved a conjugate of an anti-carcinoembryonic antigen-antibody conjugated with vindesine. Administered to patients with various types of advanced metastatic carcinomas, this ADC was deemed safe and showed signs of effectiveness. However, the initial challenges led to advancements in ADC technology, including the transition from murine to humanized antibodies, enhancing their compatibility with the human immune system and improving the overall therapeutic potential of ADCs [35,[101][102][103][104]. Among the most significant weaknesses that limited the efficacy of these initial ADCs were the low potency of the chemotherapeutic agent, the instability of the binding of the drug to the antibody, and low antigen selectivity [35,[103][104][105].",

            "text": "The level of conjugated payload is generally considered as a valuable indicator related to ADC efficacy and toxicity [119]. As mentioned previously, LC-MS based quantitative analysis of conjugated ADCs is usually coupled with immunoaffinity pull-down [57,68,91,97]. For ADCs with cleavable linkers, conjugated payload is quantified after isolation of small molecules from proteins and then linker cleavage. For example, for the ADC utilizing an enzymesensitive dipeptide Val-Cit linker (e.g., brentuximab vedotin), the release of payload can be achieved by digestion with proteases such as cathepsin B and papain [67,68,93,94,120e122]. For the ADC with a disulfide bond linker (e.g., coltuximab ravtansin), reducing agent such as DTT and TCEP is employed for cleavage [123,124]. Conventionally, conjugated antibody and conjugated payload are measured by two independent assays using two aliquots of the same samples. Xu et al. [125] introduced an LC-MS approach enabling simultaneous measurement of total antibody and antibody-conjugated drug in plasma samples, followed by immunocapture enrichment. The strategy utilizes sequentially enzymatic digestion with cathepsin B and then Lys-C to release conjugated payload and then signature peptide of the antibody component. The assay platform was further applied in another ADC containing a polymer linker via an ester bond, which was cleaved by sodium hydroxide [99]. \n\nAs mentioned previously, quantification of conjugated payloads of ADCs with cleavable linkers can be achieved after linker cleavage, which is an alternative method to intact LC-MS-based DAR measurement in biological samples [67,68,91,93,94]. The average DAR is calculated as the molar ratio of conjugated payload vs. total antibody, and the change of average DAR could indicate ADC deconjugation in vivo [94].",

            "text": "In the lysosomal compartment, the process of intracellular proteolytic degradation reduces the ADC to the level of amino acids. For this type of linker to be effective, the cytotoxic agent must maintain its activity, despite still being attached to part of the linker [22]. ADCs with non-cleavable linkers are considered to have improved therapeutic index because of their greater plasma stability, although new designs of cleavable linkers have significantly improved stability [23]. \n\nIt is clear that the disposition of a mAb is dependent upon several factors (Figure 1), and not just the therapeutic entity conjugated to it, in the case of an ADC. While mAbs trigger an effector function on their own, ADCs act more like prodrugs, and may or may not exert an anti-cancer effect until the SM drug is released from the mAb carrier. Thus, the pharmacology of mAbs and ADCs are complex. As a result, analytical and PK studies must be performed to assess the disposition of not just conjugated and released forms of ADCs, but also the effects of modifications on the mAbs after administration. \n\nAntibodies 2018, 7, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 28 improve ADC solubility or reduce ADC aggregation [6,20]. Typically, linkers used in ADC formulations are classified as being either \"cleavable\" or \"non-cleavable\". Cleavable linkers respond to physiological stimuli, such as low pH or proteolytic cleavage, to release the cytotoxic drug from its ADC carrier [21]. In theory, these linkers are catalyzed in a tumor cells, due to the presence, or increased presence, of their catalyst, to allow for selective release of the cytotoxic agent [5,21]. An example of a cleavable linker is seen in brentuximab vedotin, where the monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) cytotoxic payload is released by protease activity (Adcetris, Settle Genetics, Seattle, WA, USA).",

Unlike conventional chemotherapeutic drug-based therapies, that are mainly associated with modest specificity and therapeutic benefit, the three key components that form an ADC (a monoclonal antibody bound to a cytotoxic drug via a chemical linker moiety) achieve remarkable improvement in terms of targeted killing of cancer cells and, while sparing healthy tissues, a reduction in systemic side effects caused by off-tumor toxicity. Based on their beneficial mechanism of action, 15 ADCs have been approved to date by the market approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and/or other international governmental agencies for use in clinical oncology, and hundreds are undergoing evaluation in the preclinical and clinical phases. Here, our aim is to provide a comprehensive overview of the key features revolving around ADC therapeutic strategy including their structural and targeting properties, mechanism of action, the role of the tumor microenvironment and review the approved ADCs in clinical oncology, providing discussion regarding their toxicity profile, clinical manifestations and use in novel combination therapies. Finally, we briefly review ADCs in other pathological contexts and provide key information regarding ADC manufacturing and analytical characterization.",

ADCs are acting like a magic bullet which delivers cytotoxic drugs specifically to cancerous cells throughout the body, thus attacks these cells, while not harming healthy cells. ADCs are complex molecules that are composed of an antibody having targeting capability and linked-payload or cytotoxic drug killing cancerous cells. The key factors of the success in the development of ADC are selection of appropriate antibody, cytotoxic payload and linker for conjugation. Recently there was considerable progress in ADCs development, and a large number of ADCs gained US FDA approval. About 80 new ADCs are under active clinical studies. In this review we present a brief introduction of the US-FDA approved ADCs and global situation in the clinical studies of ADC pipelines. We address an overview on each component of an ADC design such as target antigens, payloads, linkers, conjugation methods, drug antibody ratio. In addition, we discuss on the trend of ADC market where global big pharmas and domestic biopharmaceutical companies are competing to develop safer and more effective ADCs.",

            "text": "In other words, conjugation at sites that are \"protected\" from bulk solvent due to their site of attachment results in ADCs in which the payload cannot effectively interact with the HIC stationary phase, translating into low retention times. In contrast, conjugation at sites that are highly exposed provides ADCs in which the linkerpayload is free to interact with the HIC stationary phase, resulting in high retention times. The strong correlation displayed above suggests that HIC retention time may serve as a useful guide to address potential metabolic liabilities that may be encountered in other ADC programs. \n\nThe improved metabolic stability of ADC6 resulted in a conjugate with approximately 2-fold improved efficacy in spite of drug-loading that was one-half of the parent ADC1 (Figure 4A vs C). Additionally, the metabolic improvements observed in plasma translated effectively to the in vivo system. ADC6 retained its acetate ester upon vivo dosing in contrast to ADC1, which was rapidly metabolized in vivo. This is a clear demonstration that the site of attachment can effectively modulate ADC metabolism. This adds to a growing body of evidence that site specific ADCs can provide significant advantages over conventional conjugations (to hinge cysteine and lysine) that result in mixtures of ADC species. \n\nPioneering work first reported in 2008 by Junutula and colleagues paved the way for the advancement of site-specific ADCs for the treatment of cancer. 23 Since that time, a variety of enzymatic and chemical approaches have been used to generate ADCs loaded at specifically defined sites on the antibody backbone. 3,24 These conjugation approaches have resulted in ADCs with improved PK, 19 decreased metabolism, 19,25 and improved safety. 23 Based on these results, the ADC community has slowly but inexorably shifted from conventional lysine and hinge-cysteine conjugations to site-specific conjugations. 3 However, as this shift has been taking place, there have been very few reports that address the underlying biophysical properties that might be driving such improvements thereby allowing researchers to proactively select beneficial sites for up-and-coming ADC programs.",

            "text": "ADCs are currently being investigated for the treatment of a variety of cancers. The mechanistic basis for the ADC activity includes its specific binding to the cellular target, triggering ADC cellular internalization by pinocytosis, followed by the intracellular release of the payload (Roberts et al., 2013). Therefore, after administration into the systemic circulation, the antibody fragment guides the complex to the targeted tumor antigen where it becomes internalized into the cancer cell (Hasan et al., 2018). The intracellular release of the payload in its active form results in cell death. The three components of ADCs, namely the antibody, the linker and the cytotoxic drug, have their own inherent characteristics and limitations which influence each other, thus finding the best combination of these components to design an ideal ADC is a complicated task (Hasan et al., 2018). Although this targeted approach appears straightforward, its translation to clinical practice has been problematic with initial attempts failing due to inappropriate linker systems or insufficiently potent cytotoxins, resulting in unfavorable therapeutic indices. Modern ADCs tend to use highly potent cytotoxic molecules, such as derivatives of calicheamicin, maytansine and auristatins (Senter, 2009;Ducry and Stump, 2010). A number of these molecules have demonstrated substantial in vivo antitumor activity. To translate the fundamental advantage of ADCs in targeting tumor-selective or tumor-specific antigens in clinical practice, it is essential that linkers be of sufficient stability to minimize systemic exposure to the cytotoxin and the resulting toxicities, while still providing sufficient targeted intracellular release of the cytotoxic agent (Roberts et al., 2013).",

            "text": "Interestingly, Junutula et al. [50] recently reported a site-specific conjugation method called THIOMAB technology enabling near-uniform, low-level conjugation of cytotoxins (DAR=2) to antitumor antibodies, which displayed an increased tolerability or improved therapeutic index without compromising efficacy. This new type of THIOMAB-drug conjugates (TDCs) with nearly homogeneous composition of conjugates was better tolerated than conventional ADC in monkeys, and also showed slower catabolism and deconjugation than ADC in rats. The THIOMAB approach provides a general strategy for improved PK and superior therapeutic index of any ADC generated by standard sufhydryl-directed maleimide chemistry [51]. Likewise, Dennler et al. more recently presented another site-specific modification of deglycosylated antibodies by microbial transglutaminase (MTGase) to form ADCs with a defined homogeneous DAR of 2 as well. This chemo-enzymatic approach was reported directly applicable to abroad variety of antibodies as it does not require prior genetic modifications of the antibody sequence [52]. Clearly, the designing and forming a homogeneous ADC can result in less complicated in vitro characterization and relatively easier in vivo PK bioanalysis as well as safety evaluation than a typical heterogeneous ADC. \n\nApart from the DAR characterization, some in vitro ADME models and in vivo PK studies can be employed for ADC evaluations as illustrated in Figure 1. First ADME testing of ADCs is linker stability assessment both in in vitro or in vivo by LC-MS/MS method or radiolabeled ADC, respectively, in order to explore the impact of linker on uptake and catabolism. Secondly, free toxin was expected to undergo clearance mechanism studies for DDI potential including liver microsomal stability, metabolizing enzyme identification, CYP inhibition and induction, in vitro metabolite profiling studies [53]. Then, general in vivo PK studies and non-clinical safety evaluations including immunogenicity with relevant animal species are necessary for PCC selection.",

            "text": "The current set of ADCs in clinical development use ADC payloads that are attached to protease cleavable, acid labile or non cleavable linkers. These ADC payloads and linkers are covalently attached to the amines on lysines or the thiols on cysteines which results in a heterogeneous mixture of antibodies containing 0 to 8 drugs per antibody [14]. ADCs which contain 8 drugs per antibody are less stable in circulation as compared to ADCs which have a lower number of drugs per antibody. As the number of drugs per antibody decreases, the pharmacokinetic properties of the ADC improve [16]. The instability of the ADCs with a higher DAR may result in the systemic release of drug payload, which may be responsible for the non target-related toxicities reported for various ADCs. Therefore the goals for the next generation of ADCs are to reduce the number of drugs per antibody, which will improve the pharmacokinetic properties of the ADC; to improve the stability of the ADC payload, which will reduce the non target related toxicities; and improve the CMC properties of the ADC while maintaining the in vivo anti tumor efficacy and the in vitro cytotoxicity of the ADC. The direct incorporation of the non-natural amino acid, Paraacetyl phenylalanine (pAF) at specific sites on an anti-Her2 antibody, allows for the site specific incorporation of two drugs per antibody [11]. This is similar to what was reported for modified version of T-DM1 (ThioTMab) where the specific incorporation of cysteines into Herceptin resulted in a homogeneous preparation containing 1.8 drugs per antibody [10]. The lack of unconjugated antibody in the preparations offers a distinct advantage over the ADCs where the ADC payload is conjugated to antibody's free cysteine or lysine residues. \n\nThe conjugation chemistry used to attach the drug payload A to pAF generates an oxime bond, which has been reported to be very stable [17].",

Most of the decrease in concentration occurred during the first 24 hr of the study, with a more gradual decrease for the remainder of the 96 hr (Figure S1a,b). \n\nThe acMMAE concentrations, which are a measure of the amount of MMAE conjugated to polatuzumab vedotin or surrogate ADC, decreased gradually over the 96-hr study in all species tested (Figure S1c,d). The proportion of acMMAE, relative to time 0.01 hr, decreased to approximately 60% at 96 hr for all species.

            "text": "A big challenge when studying ADCs is the often very high potency of the payload drug requiring the use of strict safety protocols and controlled environments. Thus, the safest alternative for preliminary studies particularly for analytical method development is to use a nontoxic model with payload molecules that mimic the structure/ behavior of the real drug-linker which facilitates the safe study of all the key steps from starting material preparation to final purification of conjugated products. The drug mimic used here was selected to be similar (e.g., solubility, absorptivity) to common drug-linkers used in marketed ADCs but avoided toxicity issues. We used a molecule composed of valine, citruline, PAB-OH, with an active maleimide terminal group, which is a common commercial ADC linker (Joubert et al., 2020). We selected a nonfluorescent small molecule because we wanted to minimize interference, and only measure the changes in protein fluorescence (Supporting Information: Figures S2 and S3). \n\nConjugates were prepared by partial reduction of IgG disulfide bonds with TCEP. HCl for 2 h followed by alkylation with an excess of the \"drug\" linker for 2 h, at 20\u00b0C. The two-step reactions were conducted in 1 \u00d7 1 cm path length quartz cuvettes with slow stirring (using a flea magnetic follower in the cuvette with the sample holder stirrer) in the spectrometer (Supporting Information: Figure S3). A total of 24 reactions were performed, using 8 reducing agent TCEP concentrations from 0 to 50 molar excess (0, 1.25, 2.50, 5.0, 7.5, 10, 25, and 50) in triplicate. For all reactions, the same amount of \"drug\" linker (20-fold excess compared to mAb concentration) and NAC quencher (12-fold excess with respect to linker concentration) was used. The reaction mixtures were measured by absorbance and pEEM spectroscopy at 45-minute intervals during the reaction (designated Red1-/2-/3-IgG, Alk1-/2-/3-/4-IgG).",

Factors contributing to this narrow safety window include the instability of the linkers, accelerated plasma clearance due to the hydrophobicity of the ADCs, and off-target toxicity caused by nonspecific uptake by non-antigen expression healthy cells, free payload pre-release in the circulation system, low tumor retention due to heterogeneity of tumor antigen level and ADC DAR value By preserving the essential functions of the antibody and the payload, an optimized linker can significantly enhance ADC therapeutic window by increasing hydrophilicity and stability while reducing non-specific endocytosis by non-tumor cells. We have designed a panel of novel linkers focused on improving hydrophilicity and stability of ADC, with a particular emphasis on reducing its off-target endocytosis. A key feature of our linkers is the inclusion of a negative charged side chain and hydrophilic chaperone, which not only minimizes non-specific uptake by non-tumor cells but also greatly enhances its hydrophilicity. The side chain linker with this special architecture allows efficient enzymatic cleavage to ensure rapid payload release intracellularly, and lead to superior bystander cell killing effect than the ADC with GGFG-Dxd linker system. One example exploiting the proprietary linker is Trastuzumab-BL-001-exatecan with a drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) of 8, demonstrated hydrophilicity comparable to Trastuzumab-GGFG-Dxd (biosimilar) in HIC analysis, with no aggregation detected by analytical SEC. This ADC exhibited excellent stability, maintaining high solubility, and cytotoxicity under stressed conditions. It also resisted deconjugation in the presence of high concentration of N -acetylcysteine and showed exceptional stability in human and mouse plasma. Pharmacokinetic studies in rats indicated favorable pharmacokinetic properties, while efficacy testing in the NCI-N87 tumor model revealed comparable performance to Trastuzumab-GGFG-Dxd. Additionally, BLB-101 ADC, featuring the same linker, was well tolerated in non-human primates following repeated administration. In conclusion, our novel linker designs offer significant advantages, with features that could expand the therapeutic window of current ADCs by improving their stability, reducing off-target effects, increasing bystander activity, and maintaining efficacy.

PA289, is the lead linker-payload from our ProAlk payload technology platform and is designed with tumor-selective glucuronide triggers that attenuate the potency of the payload until uptake into target cancer cells and selective release in the lysosome. The glucuronide linker and PermaLink (PL) conjugation chemistry ensure ADC stability. The unique mechanism of action of PA289 compared to currently used chemotherapies and ADC payloads, led us to generate proof-of-concept data for this novel ADC payload.\n \n \n \n The free payload and ADCs were tested for cell-killing activity in vitro by CellTiter-Glo assay. The prodrug linker-payload PA289, was conjugated using PermaLink technology to generate ADCs with a drug to antibody ratio (DAR) of approximately 4. Stability was determined in mouse and human plasma and in vivo efficacy was performed with subcutaneous human tumor xenografts in nude mice. Bystander effect was analyzed in vitro and compared to ADCs composed of MMAE and MMAF payloads. An exploratory toxicology study was conducted in cynomolgus monkeys.\n \n \n \n The free payload showed highly potent in vitro activity against 248 cancer cell lines representing 15 solid cancer indications with IC50 values in the fM to pM range. Isumab01-PL-PA289, a model ADC targeting FRA, displayed excellent plasma stability and was highly potent against the JEG-3 cell line in vitro, with IC50 values in the pM range. A single administration of Isumab01-PL-PA289 in the FRA-positive JEG-3 xenograft model induced complete tumor regression by day 30 when dosed at 2.2 mg/kg, while the Isotype-PL-PA289 non-binding control resulted in weak tumor growth inhibition. Evaluation of bystander killing in vitro with a model ADC targeting CA242, Isumab04-PL-PA289, demonstrated stronger bystander cell-killing than benchmark ADCs containing MMAE and MMAF. A pilot toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys treated with Isumab04-PL-PA289 showed the ADC was well-tolerated with minimal to no test-article related findings at the highest dose tested (7 mg/kg single dose).\n \n \n \n ADCs comprised of PA289, a novel protein alkylator prodrug linker-payload, demonstrate 1) strong in vitro potency and bystander effect, 2) durable tumor regressions in xenograft models, and 3) excellent tolerability in monkeys.

Conceived by Paul Ehrlich in the early 1900s, the concept of a magic bullet selectively eliminating cancer cells has evolved alongside bioengineering and cancer biology advancements. ADCs consist of a monoclonal antibody, linker, and cytotoxic payload, designed to target specific antigens on tumor cells while minimizing collateral damage. Mechanistically, ADCs are internalized via endocytosis, releasing the cytotoxic payload within the lysosome, potentially affecting neighboring tumor cells. ADC development has progressed through multiple generations, each addressing limitations of its predecessors. From gemtuzumab ozogamicin to trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), and now to third-generation agents such as trastuzumab deruxtecan (DS-8201) and disitamab vedotin (RC48), improvements have been made in target selectivity, potency, linker stability, and reduced off-target effects. Significant success has been seen in ADCs targeting human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 and trophoblast cell-surface antigen 2 antigens, especially in patients with breast cancer, including those resistant to previous therapies. The future of ADCs includes exploring new surface antigens, bispecific antibodies, immune-activating antibodies, radiopharmaceutical-loaded ADCs, and masked ADCs for tissue-specific activation. Ongoing research aims to optimize treatment efficacy while minimizing toxicity, expanding the potential of combination therapy. ADCs represent a promising frontier in precision cancer treatment, with continued research enhancing their potential in breast cancer and beyond. This review provides a comprehensive exploration of ADCs' evolution in breast cancer therapy, offering a molecular perspective to inform clinical practice and update colleagues on this dynamic field.",

The rank order of potency for DAR 2 site-specific ADCs (conjugated at the C239i position) matched the order for the corresponding free drugs in vitro.

Higher-DAR conjugates were stable and displayed good rat pharmacokinetic profiles as measured by ELISA and LC-MS/MS. A single intravenous dose of isotype control SG3584 DAR 2 ADC resulted in no mortality in rats or monkeys at doses of up to 25 and 30 mg/kg, respectively.

However, tumor heterogeneity and microenvironment complexity are still the major factors contributing to drug resistance, recurrence, and metastasis, which cannot be resolved with a mono therapy strategy. We\u2019ve developed a novel dual drug ADC (BiADC), BR113, by conjugating an anti-hTrop2 antibody with a drug linker of a Topoisomerase I inhibitor payload, and another drug linker of an immune stimulator. Our studies show that the homogeneous ADC containing two distinct payloads is a new promising drug class, with two different anti-tumor MOAs, synergistic antigen-specific cell killing potency, desirable pharmacokinetic profiles, and minimal toxicity at therapeutic doses. In the cancer cells and human PBMC co-culture assay, BR113 exerts significantly more potent killing on cancer cells than two individual single-drug ADCs and the combination of two single-drug ADCs, which suggested a synergy on anti-tumor effects of this dual-drug ADC. In the xenograft mouse model studies, BR113 exhibits greater treatment effect and survival benefit than the combo of two single-drug ADCs at various doses. This robust superior anti-tumor activity is further confirmed in a hTrop2-MC38 syngeneic model with a prolonged anti-tumor protection against the tumor re-challenge. Finally, the novel BiADC, BR113, is well tolerated in hTop2 humanized mice after repeated administration. Our findings highlight the therapeutic potential of the BiADC format for treating refractory advanced solid tumors. The outstanding anti-tumor activity across various CDX tumor models and its favorable safety profile in mice support further evaluation of the innovative BiADC, BR113.\n Citation Format: Jie Zhu, Xiaobei Zhao, Eileen Li, Hong Xu, Lei Nie, Gang Chen, Haibing Wang.

            "text": "\n Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are emerging therapeutic agents for targeted cancer treatment with remarkable clinical success. However, tumor heterogeneity and microenvironment complexity are still the major factors contributing to drug resistance, recurrence, and metastasis, which cannot be resolved with a mono therapy strategy. We\u2019ve developed a novel dual drug ADC (BiADC), BR113, by conjugating an anti-hTrop2 antibody with a drug linker of a Topoisomerase I inhibitor payload, and another drug linker of an immune stimulator. Our studies show that the homogeneous ADC containing two distinct payloads is a new promising drug class, with two different anti-tumor MOAs, synergistic antigen-specific cell killing potency, desirable pharmacokinetic profiles, and minimal toxicity at therapeutic doses. In the cancer cells and human PBMC co-culture assay, BR113 exerts significantly more potent killing on cancer cells than two individual single-drug ADCs and the combination of two single-drug ADCs, which suggested a synergy on anti-tumor effects of this dual-drug ADC. In the xenograft mouse model studies, BR113 exhibits greater treatment effect and survival benefit than the combo of two single-drug ADCs at various doses. This robust superior anti-tumor activity is further confirmed in a hTrop2-MC38 syngeneic model with a prolonged anti-tumor protection against the tumor re-challenge. Finally, the novel BiADC, BR113, is well tolerated in hTop2 humanized mice after repeated administration. Our findings highlight the therapeutic potential of the BiADC format for treating refractory advanced solid tumors. The outstanding anti-tumor activity across various CDX tumor models and its favorable safety profile in mice support further evaluation of the innovative BiADC, BR113.\n Citation Format: Jie Zhu, Xiaobei Zhao, Eileen Li, Hong Xu, Lei Nie, Gang Chen, Haibing Wang.

Most ADCs in the clinic, including these two approved ones, utilize a tubulin-acting cytotoxic agent. Although many cancers are sensitive to tubulin agents, some cancers are more responsive to DNA-acting agents. We have developed a new class of highly potent cytotoxic agents, IGNs, for use in ADCs which consist of indolino-benzodiazepine dimers with a novel DNA-alkylating mechanism of action. The intense in vitro potency (in the picomolar range) of these IGNs, along with desired characteristics such as aqueous solubility and stability, make them well-suited for use in ADCs. A series of IGN-ADCs was prepared using di-imine (DNA-crosslinking and -alkylating) and mono-imine (DNA-alkylating only) versions of the IGNs, attached using noncleavable and cleavable linkers. The tolerability of IGN-ADCs in mice was found to be dependent upon a) linker format: conjugates with cleavable linkers were better tolerated than those with noncleavable linkers; and b) mechanism of action: conjugates with IGNs with DNA-crosslinking ability (di-imine IGNs) had delayed toxicity that was absent with the DNA-alkylating only (mono-imine) IGN. We found that the cleavable linker format avoids liver toxicity, which was the dose-limiting toxicity of IGN-ADCs with non-cleavable linkers. This absence of liver toxicity resulted in a 4-fold increase in the maximally tolerated dose for the cleavable linker ADC compared with the noncleavable linker design (40 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg conjugate dose, respectively). Thus, IGN-ADCs utilizing a cleavable linker with a mono-imine IGN demonstrated greatly improved tolerability. The in vivo efficacy of ADCs with the selected IGN, 3m (mono-imine) attached using a cleavable linker was evaluated in xenograft models of both hematologic and solid tumor indications. A CD33-targeting IGN-ADC, anti-CD33-3m, was highly active against acute myeloid leukemia xenografts, with a minimal efficacious dose (MED) of 0.6 mg/kg (conjugate dose), while a non-targeting control was inactive. A folate receptor \u03b1-targeting IGN-ADC, anti-FR\u03b1-3m, and an epidermal growth factor receptor-targeting IGN-ADC, anti-EGFR-3m, were evaluated in non-small cell lung cancer models and found to be highly active and antigen-specific, with MEDs of 1.6 mg/kg. Anti-CD56-3m was highly active and antigen-specific against small-cell lung cancer xenografts, with a MED of 2.9 mg/kg. The desired safety profile (absence of delayed toxicity and liver toxicity) combined with the potent antigen-specific activity of these IGN 3m-ADCs (mono-imine IGN, cleavable linker) against various cancer types supports DNA-acting ADCs with the necessary therapeutic index can now be achieved.

            "abstract": "\n \n Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) therapy failure due to relapse or refractory disease is likely attributed to the persistence of resting leukemic stem cells (LSCs) in the patient's bone marrow. As those cells do not divide, they have a decreased vulnerability towards standard chemotherapy. There is thus a high need to develop efficient and specific anti-LSC compounds that advance to the clinic. These agents must have the potential to specifically target LSCs and to eradicate them despite their resting and drug-resistant state. These prerequisites can be elegantly met using antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) with a carefully selected target and payload. Herein, we describe the development of two FLT3-targeting ADCs either utilizing a DNA-damaging or a microtubule-targeting drug as payload and an in-depth investigation of their capability to eradicate LSCs.\n In payload studies with arrested and proliferating cell lines, we show sustained activity of the DNA-damaging agent duocarmycin (DUBA) in the resting cells, while the efficacy of microtubule-targeting agents was diminished. These results suggested that DUBA could be a promising payload for the construction of an anti-LSC ADC. When conjugated to the humanized FLT3-mAb 20D9h3, both DUBA and monomethyl auristatin F (MMAF) efficiently eradicated FLT3-positive AML cell lines in vitro by proliferation-inhibition and apoptosis induction. While 20D9h3-DUBA arrests cells in G1/S and activates ATR-CHK1 DNA damage repair pathway, 20D9h3-MMAF halts the cell cycle in G2/M, in line with the payload's mechanism of action. In contrast to gemtuzumab ozogamicin, both ADCs do not lose efficacy in cells overexpressing the drug-resistance transporter ATP-dependent translocase (ABCB1).\n We went on to analyze the potency of both ADCs towards early and very early leukemic progenitors using patient-derived xenograft (PDX) and primary AML cells from three different donors. To this end, we used colony-forming unit (CFU) assays, long-term culture initiating cell (LTC-IC) assays and leukemia-initiating cell (LIC) assays. Overall, 20D9h3-DUBA was highly potent in eradicating colonies and preventing engraftment with effective doses as low as 0.025 \u00b5g/ml. Despite not being as effective as 20D9h3-DUBA in colony-assays, 20D9h3-MMAF pre-treatment of AML-393 (0.3 \u00b5g/ml) and AML-388 (1 \u00b5g/ml) PDX cells was also able to prevent leukemic outgrowth in 4/5 and 5/5 NSG mice, respectively. This is remarkable, as microtubule-targeting agents are generally not regarded as ideal payload choice to eliminate quiescent stem cells. Importantly, healthy CD34-positive bone marrow cells analyzed in the same assays were not harmed by either ADC at the effective doses highlighting the excellent therapeutic window provided by the FLT3 target.\n The maleimide-technology used in 20D9h3-DUBA is associated with short-comings such as tendency to aggregate, loss of linker-payload due to thiol-exchange reaction and carboxylesterase 1c (CES1c) cleavage specifically in rodents complicating in vivo analyses. In contrast, 20D9h3-MMAF is conjugated by the P5 technology, leading to stable and hydrophilic ADCs. Despite those difficulties, both 20D9h3-MMAF and 20D9h3-DUBA led to strong tumor reductions in AML-388 xenograft mouse models after intravenous treatment with 2 x 3 mg/kg.\n In summary, we provide evidence that FLT3-targeting ADCs with both DUBA and MMAF as payload sucessfully eradicate AML LSCs. Further advancements will encompass linker improvements of 20D9h3-DUBA to eventually unite the ADC's particularly high potency towards AML LSCs with an excellent linker stability.\n",

            "text": "\n \n Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) therapy failure due to relapse or refractory disease is likely attributed to the persistence of resting leukemic stem cells (LSCs) in the patient's bone marrow. As those cells do not divide, they have a decreased vulnerability towards standard chemotherapy. There is thus a high need to develop efficient and specific anti-LSC compounds that advance to the clinic. These agents must have the potential to specifically target LSCs and to eradicate them despite their resting and drug-resistant state. These prerequisites can be elegantly met using antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) with a carefully selected target and payload. Herein, we describe the development of two FLT3-targeting ADCs either utilizing a DNA-damaging or a microtubule-targeting drug as payload and an in-depth investigation of their capability to eradicate LSCs.\n In payload studies with arrested and proliferating cell lines, we show sustained activity of the DNA-damaging agent duocarmycin (DUBA) in the resting cells, while the efficacy of microtubule-targeting agents was diminished. These results suggested that DUBA could be a promising payload for the construction of an anti-LSC ADC. When conjugated to the humanized FLT3-mAb 20D9h3, both DUBA and monomethyl auristatin F (MMAF) efficiently eradicated FLT3-positive AML cell lines in vitro by proliferation-inhibition and apoptosis induction. While 20D9h3-DUBA arrests cells in G1/S and activates ATR-CHK1 DNA damage repair pathway, 20D9h3-MMAF halts the cell cycle in G2/M, in line with the payload's mechanism of action.

DHES0815A is an ADC consisting of a THIOMABTM humanized IgG1 anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody (hu7C2), which binds domain 1 of the HER2 ECD, conjugated via a disulfide linker to PBD-monoamide (MA), a DNA mono-alkylating agent. The reduced potency of the PBD-MA payload compared to PBD dimers and the stability of the conjugation site and linker were designed to improve tolerability, whereas the binding of hu7C2 to a HER2 epitope distinct from trastuzumab and pertuzumab allows combination with existing HER2 therapies. . Methods: Modifications at one imine in the PBD (pyrrolobenzodiazepine) dimer produced mono-alkylating PBDs that were assessed for DNA binding, permeability and cell potency. Each modified PBD was conjugated to hu7C2 LC K149C via a disulfide linker and assessed in HER2-positive models in vitro and in vivo. Safety studies were performed in female and male cynomolgus monkey treated every 3 weeks X 5, with a 7-week follow-up. Assessments included hematology, clinical chemistry, anti-drug antibody, standard clinical, neurological and ophthalmic exams and histopathology. Results: Our goal was design of a reduced potency PBD dimer ADC to achieve dosing in the linear PK range for optimal exposure, efficacy and safety. PBD dimers contain 2 reactive imines that bis-alkylate and crosslink DNA. Mono-alkylating PBD dimers were assessed in DNA binding, potency and permeability assays to select the optimal mono-alkylator, PBD-MA, for further investigation. hu7C2-disulfide-PBD-MA, or DHES0815A, was potent across HER2-positive breast and gastric cancer models in vitro and in vivo, with little effect on HER2-negative tumors or normal primary cells in vitro. DHES0815A was more potent than T-DM1 in HER2-positive and HER2-low breast and gastric cancer PDX models and demonstrated combination activity with standard of care agents T-DM1 or docetaxel. Mechanistically, treatment of HER2-positive cells with DHES0815A resulted in late S-phase cell cycle arrest; induction of DNA damage markers \u03b3H2AX, phospho-p53, phospho-CHK2, induction of apoptosis, and bystander activity. Pharmacokinetic analysis showed dose-proportional PK, with linear biphasic PK >/= 4mg/kg in cynomolgus monkey. Safety studies in cynomolgus monkey treated with 4, 8 or 12 mg/kg demonstrated that findings were non-adverse, monitorable and manageable. All doses were tolerated with few clinical observations and minimal to mild clinical pathology changes. Target organs were skin, bone marrow, lung and eye. The HNSTD (highest non-severely toxic dose) was 12 mg/kg. This dose enabled a starting dose of 0.6 mg/kg for phase 1 testing. Conclusions: DHES0815A is a HER2-directed ADC comprised of a domain I binding antibody linked to a reduced potency PBD dimer, PBD-MA, via a reducible disulfide linker. The antibody does not interfere with trastuzumab or pertuzumab binding, allowing combination with existing HER2 therapies. The reduced potency payload allows dosing in the linear PK range, supporting our hypothesis. DHES0815A demonstrated dose-dependent anti-tumor efficacy in multiple HER2+ breast and gastric cancer models, and showed efficacy in HER2-low models, where T-DM1 was inactive. Enhanced anti-tumor activity was observed combining DHES0815A with T-DM1, trastuzumab/pertuzumab or docetaxel. Studies in cynomolgus monkey demonstrated a safety profile compatible with initiating a phase 1 clinical trial.

Valine\u2013citrulline (Val\u2013Cit) coupled with a self-immolative \u03c1-aminobenzyl (PAB) spacer as a cleavable dipeptide linker, designated as \u201cVC linker\u201d in this letter, has been popularly used in ADC conjugation. However, VC linker is highly hydrophobic and, together with hydrophobic payloads at high DARs (drug-toantibody ratios), may turn ADC molecules that have hydrophilic parts in their antibody portions, into aggregation-prone \u201csurfactant-like\u201d structures. Aggregation of ADCs in vivo may lead to accelerated plasma clearance, suboptimal efficacy, and increased toxicity. Trophoblastic cell-surface antigen-2 (Trop-2) is not only overexpressed in a variety of solid human carcinomas, but also expressed at variable levels in crucial normal tissues like skin and mucosa, making it a druggable but risky target for ADC therapies. IMMU-132, a Trop-2-targeting ADC molecule using SN38, a moderate-toxicity payload, together with a PEGylated acid-labile linker, has been approved by the FDA in April 2020 for treating triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). However, another Trop-2targeting ADC molecule, RN927C, which adopts more toxic auristatin-derived payload Aur0101 and a hydrophobic linker, was terminated early in Phase I clinical trial (NCT02122146) due to excess toxicity, highlighting that the key of success in targeting Trop-2 with ADC technologies is to screen for optimal linker and payload combinations in order to achieve the highest therapeutic index. As paclitaxel (PTX) has been used therapeutically in pancreatic cancer and TNBC, in which Trop-2 is highly expressed, it appears to be a viable payload option for Trop-2-targeting ADCs. However, poor aqueous solubility of PTX has impeded its therapeutic application in carcinomas. To overcome solubility problem, more hydrophilic PTX derivatives and prodrugs, as well as ADCs, have been tested. Up to date, however, PTX-conjugated ADCs failed to exhibit sufficient anticarcinogenic effects in vivo, or did they progress to clinical development stage. The cause of unsatisfactory preclinical results has not been fully understood, but maybe in part by the simultaneous use of hydrophobic linkers with ultrahydrophobic PTX. In a separate study (unpublished), we have optimized PEGylation in MMAE-conjugated ADCs and found that replacing citrulline with lysine in a cleavable dipeptide \u201cVC linker\u201d and incorporating linear PEG24 to lysine\u2019s free amino group as a parallel branch (peg4-Val-Lys(PEG24)-PAB, designated as \u201cVK linker\u201d in this letter, see (Fig. 1a) rendered the most stability and hydrophilicity to ADC molecules. By using the VK linker, we successfully generated a stable PTX-conjugated ADC and, designated as hRS7-VK-PTX (Fig. 1a), with a high DAR value at 8 (Fig. 1b). However, our effort to conjugate PTX to hRS7 through a hydrophobic VC linker failed because this molecule precipitated completely from solution during preparation, supporting the concept that combining hydrophobic linkers with ultra-hydrophobic payloads would impair molecular stability of ADC molecules. For comparison purpose, we also conjugated payload MMAE (auristatin E) and SN38 to hRS7 with DAR value at 8, namely hRS7-VK-MMAE and hRS7-VK-SN38 (Fig. 1b; Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2a). MMAE cannot be used as a free drug therapeutically due to excessive toxicity, but has gained popularity as an ADC payload. SN38 is a moderate-toxicity payload used in IMMU-132 mentioned above. Both MMAE and SN38 are hydrophobic but not as much as PTX (data not shown). After conjugation to hRS7 with a VK linker, none of the three ADCs showed severe aggregation and degradation even after incubation at 60 \u00b0C for 1 h (Supplementary Fig. 2c, d, e), indicating that PEGylation linker can improve the stability of ADC molecules with hydrophobic payloads. In cancer cell lines with diverse Trop-2 expression levels, our results indicated that free drug PTX is not as potent as MMAE, but similar to SN38 (Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4). As ADC, rather surprisingly, hRS7-VK-PTX was more potent than hRS7-VK-MMAE and hRS7-VK-SN38 in moderate Trop-2 expression cancer cell lines, including Capan-1, NCIH2452, MDA-MB-231, COLO205, and SK-MES-1 (Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 5). In addition, hRS7-VK-PTX even showed efficacy in PTXresistant cancer cell lines, including SKBR3, CFPAC-1, MDA-MB-231, and COLO205 (Fig. 1h). Therefore, employment of a hydrophilic linker in PTX-conjugated ADC, as we hypothesized, significantly enhanced the anticarcinogenic potency of PTX in vitro. The internalization rate of ADCs may impact their efficiency of cancer cell killing. Interestingly, internalization of hRS7-VK-PTX was faster than that of hRS7-VK-MMAE and hRS7-VK-SN38 (Fig. 1g). Under a confocal microscope, hRS7-VK-PTX molecules co-localized with lamp-1 and clathrin\u2019s heavy chains, suggesting that they were internalized via clathrin-mediated endocytosis and trafficked into lysosomal compartments. In comparison, hRS7-VK-SN38 showed no obvious internalization (Fig. 1f). These results revealed that hRS7-VK-PTX can trigger a faster internalization rate, which may translate into superior therapeutic efficiency. We then determined the therapeutic potentials of hRS7-VK-PTX in tumor xenograft models. hRS7-VK-PTX was more efficacious than hRS7-VK-SN38 in suppressing the growth of BXPC-3, COLO205, and HCC1806 cell-derived tumor xenografts (Fig. 1c; Supplementary Figs. 6 and 7). Moreover, hRS7-VK-PTX at 3 mg/kg (0.12 mg/kg PTX equivalent) was more efficacious than PTX at 10mg/kg in suppressing the growth of BxPC-3 cell-derived xenografts (P= 0.0248, Supplementary Fig. 6a). In HCC1806 cellderived models, the efficacy of hRS7-VK-PTX at 30mg/kg (1.3 mg/ kg PTX equivalent) was comparable with PTX at 10 mg/kg (Supplementary Fig. 6b). These results suggested that adoption",

The transferrin receptor 1, CD71, known to be overexpressed in malignant cells, is considered a potent anti-tumoral target. Therefore, we have developed an anti-CD71 ADC, INA03, a humanized antibody conjugated to the monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) through a 3-arylpropiolonitrile-valine-citruline linker. In this study, we investigated both potency and safety of INA03, in competition with transferrin (Tf), the CD71's natural ligand, as a novel strategy to specifically target highly proliferative cells. The high expression of CD71 was confirmed on different leukemic cell lines, allowing INA03 to bind efficiently. Subsequently, INA03 rapidly internalizes into lysosomal compartments, where its cytotoxic drug is released following cathepsin-B cleavage. Downregulating CD71 expression using shRNA highlighted that INA03-induced cell death was dependent on CD71 density at the cell surface. INA03 intravenous treatment in acute leukemia mouse models significantly reduced tumor burden, increased mice survival and showed no residual disease compared to conventional chemotherapies. Since INA03 competes with the human Tf, a double knock-in (hCD71/hTf) competent mouse model was generated to mimic human pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. INA03 administration in hCD71/hTf mice did not reveal, even at high doses, any improper toxicities. Hence, these data demonstrate promising pre-clinical efficacy and safety of INA03 and support its development as a novel acute leukemia treatment.",

Currently, there are 40 ADCs in various phases of clinical development. However, only 34 of these have published their structures. Of the 34 disclosed structures, 24 of them use a linkage to the thiol of cysteines on the monoclonal antibody. The remaining 10 candidates utilize chemistry to surface lysines of the antibody. Due to the inherent heterogeneity of conjugation to the multiple lysines or cysteines found in mAbs, significant research efforts are now being directed toward the production of discrete, homogeneous ADC products, via site-specific conjugation. These site-specific conjugations may involve genetic engineering of the mAb to introduce discrete, available cysteines or non-natural amino acids with an orthogonally-reactive functional group handle such as an aldehyde, ketone, azido, or alkynyl tag. These site-specific approaches not only increase the homogeneity of ADCs but also enable novel bio-orthogonal chemistries that utilize reactive moieties other than thiol or amine. This broadens the diversity of linkers that can be utilized which will lead to better linker design in future generations of ADCs."

Boosted by the successes of FDA-approved Adcetris\u00ae and Kadcyla\u00ae, this drug class has been rapidly growing along with about 60 ADCs currently in clinical trials. In this article, we briefly review molecular aspects of each component (the antibody, payload, and linker) of ADCs, and then mainly discuss traditional and new technologies of the conjugation and linker chemistries for successful construction of clinically effective ADCs. Current efforts in the conjugation and linker chemistries will provide greater insights into molecular design and strategies for clinically effective ADCs from medicinal chemistry and pharmacology standpoints. The development of site-specific conjugation methodologies for constructing homogeneous ADCs is an especially promising path to improving ADC design, which will open the way for novel cancer therapeutics.",

Herein, we report that truncated AIP scaffolds can be fused with fluorophore and cytotoxic photosensitizer molecules without compromising their high agr inhibitory activity, binding affinity to the receptor AgrC, or cell specificity. Strikingly, a photosensitizer-AIP conjugate exhibited 16-fold greater efficacy in a S.\u00a0aureus cell-killing assay than a nontargeting analogue.

Non-cleavable linkers do not have a designated weak point in their structure that can lead to cleavage by proteases, hydrolases or chemically by pH changes. Consequently, when designing a conjugate, the choice of a non-cleavable over a cleavable linker is usually a consequence of pursuing a certain mode of action where the stability of the complex is more important than a fast liberation of the active moiety. Linkers of various length, polarity, stability and flexibility are used for different types of conjugates and the linker design is mostly driven by the particular purpose and desired mode of action. This article reviews non-cleavable linkers applied predominantly in Antibody Drug Conjugates (ADCs), and how they influence these conjugates in terms of ADME properties (absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination) and safety."

Advancement of such \"direct-disulfide\" bioconjugates to the clinic necessitates chemical methods to form disulfide connections efficiently, without byproducts. The disulfide connection must also be resistant to premature cleavage by thiols prior to arrival at the targeted tissue. We show here that commonly employed methods to generate direct disulfide-linked bioconjugates are inadequate for addressing these challenges. We describe our efforts to optimize direct-disulfide conjugation chemistry, focusing on the generation of conjugates between cytotoxic payloads and cysteine-engineered antibodies (i.e., THIOMAB antibody-drug conjugates, or TDCs). This work culminates in the development of novel, high-yielding conjugation chemistry for creating direct payload disulfide connections to any of several Cys mutation sites in THIOMAB antibodies or to Cys sites in other biomolecules (e.g., human serum albumin and cell-penetrating peptides). We conclude by demonstrating that hindered direct disulfide TDCs with two methyl groups adjacent to the disulfide, which have heretofore not been described for any bioconjugate, are more stable and more efficacious in mouse tumor xenograft studies than less hindered analogs.",

Recent development of ADCs has been focused on exploring technologies to produce homogeneous ADCs and new classes of payloads to expand the mechanisms of action of the delivered drugs. Certain new ADC payloads could undergo metabolism in circulation while attached to antibodies and thus affect ADC stability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy and toxicity profiles. Herein, we investigate payload stability specifically and seek general guidelines to address payload metabolism and therefore increase the overall ADC stability. Investigation was performed on various payloads with different functionalities (e.g., PNU-159682 analog, tubulysin, cryptophycin, and taxoid) using different conjugation sites (HC-A118C, LC-K149C, and HC-A140C) on THIOMAB antibodies. We were able to reduce metabolism and inactivation of a broad range of payloads of THIOMAB antibody-drug conjugates by employing optimal conjugation sites (LC-K149C and HC-A140C). Additionally, further payload stability was achieved by optimizing the linkers. Coupling relatively stable sites with optimized linkers provided optimal stability and reduction of payloads metabolism in circulation in vivo.",

As a small and central part of ADCs, a linker is designed to be stable in the bloodstream and subsequently release the drug in its active form within or close to the target cells (Alley et al., 2008)(Nagayama et al., 2017). The role of linker is fundamental for efficient delivery of the cytotoxic drug, but it is also the determinant factor to the toxicity of an ADC product. Premature release of drugs in the circulation can result in systemic toxicity and a lower therapeutic index. \n\nNeutropenia is a kind of common toxicity for many ADCs conjugated to MMAE via protease cleavable valine-citrulline linkers such as Brentuximab vedotin, ASG-5ME, Glembatumumab vedotin, Indusatumab vedotin, Polatuzumab vedotin and PSMA-targeting ADC (Beck et al., 2017)(Coveler et al., 2016)(Goeij et al., 2016)(Donaghy, 2016)(Hinrichs et al., 2015)(Younes et al., 2012). Results showed that vc-MMAE-based ADC-induced neutropenia is due to a direct cytotoxic effect of released payload on differentiated neutrophils in the bone marrow (Zhao et al., 2017). Peripheral neuropathy is another important target-independent clinical toxicity associated with microtubule inhibitor ADCs leading to treatment discontinuation and/or dose reduction (Litvak-Greenfeld et al., 2012). Microtubule inhibitors disrupt interphase microtubule function critical for the active transport of key essential proteins from the neuron cell body to distal synapses and ultimately result in peripheral neuropathy (Starobova et al., 2017).",

For maximal intratumoral drug delivery, linkers are required that are highly stable in the systemic circulation, yet allow for efficient drug release at the target site. In this respect, amide bond-based technologies constitute a technological advancement, since the linker half-lives in circulation ( t 1/2 approximately 7 days) are much longer than earlier generation linkers that break down within 1-2 days. The amide linkers, some of which contain peptides, are appended to the mAb carriers through thioether/maleimide adducts. Here, we describe that use of a bromoacetamidecaproyl (bac) in place of the maleimidocaproyl (mc) increases the plasma stability of resulting thioether ADCs. One such ADC, 1F6-C4v2-bac-MMAF, which is directed against the CD70 antigen on lymphomas and renal cell carcinoma, was prepared containing a bac thioether spacer between the drug (MMAF) and the mAb carrier (1F6-C4v2). There was no measurable systemic drug release from this ADC for 2 weeks postadministration in mice. In order to assess the impact of improving linker stability beyond mc containing ADCs, a series of mc and bac-linked 1F6-MMAF conjugates were compared for tolerability, intratumoral drug delivery, and therapeutic efficacy in nude mice with renal cell carcinoma xenografts. There were no statistically significant efficacy differences between sets of mc and bac containing ADCs, although the bac linker technology led to 25% higher intratumoral drug exposure over a 7 day period compared to the corresponding mc linker. The mechanism of drug release from maleimide-adducts likely involves a retro-Michael reaction that takes place in plasma, based on in vitro studies demonstrating that some of the released drug-maleimide derivative became covalently bound to cysteine-34 of serum albumin. In summary, the data indicate that new linkers can be obtained with improved in vivo stability by replacing the maleimide with an acetamide, but the resulting ADCs had similar tolerability and activity profiles.",
                    "[38335424 | Younes et al. | 2012 | Citations: 1400]": "PURPOSE\nBrentuximab vedotin is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that selectively delivers monomethyl auristatin E, an antimicrotubule agent, into CD30-expressing cells. In phase I studies, brentuximab vedotin demonstrated significant activity with a favorable safety profile in patients with relapsed or refractory CD30-positive lymphomas.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nIn this multinational, open-label, phase II study, the efficacy and safety of brentuximab vedotin were evaluated in patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) after autologous stem-cell transplantation (auto-SCT). Patients had histologically documented CD30-positive HL by central pathology review. A total of 102 patients were treated with brentuximab vedotin 1.8 mg/kg by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks. In the absence of disease progression or prohibitive toxicity, patients received a maximum of 16 cycles. The primary end point was the overall objective response rate (ORR) determined by an independent radiology review facility.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe ORR was 75% with complete remission (CR) in 34% of patients. The median progression-free survival time for all patients was 5.6 months, and the median duration of response for those in CR was 20.5 months. After a median observation time of more than 1.5 years, 31 patients were alive and free of documented progressive disease. The most common treatment-related adverse events were peripheral sensory neuropathy, nausea, fatigue, neutropenia, and diarrhea.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe ADC brentuximab vedotin was associated with manageable toxicity and induced objective responses in 75% of patients with relapsed or refractory HL after auto-SCT. Durable CRs approaching 2 years were observed, supporting study in earlier lines of therapy."

As a small and central part of ADCs, a linker is designed to be stable in the bloodstream and subsequently release the drug in its active form within or close to the target cells (Alley et al., 2008)(Nagayama et al., 2017). The role of linker is fundamental for efficient delivery of the cytotoxic drug, but it is also the determinant factor to the toxicity of an ADC product. Premature release of drugs in the circulation can result in systemic toxicity and a lower therapeutic index. \n\nNeutropenia is a kind of common toxicity for many ADCs conjugated to MMAE via protease cleavable valine-citrulline linkers such as Brentuximab vedotin, ASG-5ME, Glembatumumab vedotin, Indusatumab vedotin, Polatuzumab vedotin and PSMA-targeting ADC (Beck et al., 2017)(Coveler et al., 2016)(Goeij et al., 2016)(Donaghy, 2016)(Hinrichs et al., 2015)(Younes et al., 2012). Results showed that vc-MMAE-based ADC-induced neutropenia is due to a direct cytotoxic effect of released payload on differentiated neutrophils in the bone marrow (Zhao et al., 2017). Peripheral neuropathy is another important target-independent clinical toxicity associated with microtubule inhibitor ADCs leading to treatment discontinuation and/or dose reduction (Litvak-Greenfeld et al., 2012). Microtubule inhibitors disrupt interphase microtubule function critical for the active transport of key essential proteins from the neuron cell body to distal synapses and ultimately result in peripheral neuropathy (Starobova et al., 2017)."

Antibody\u2013drug conjugates (ADCs), in which a monoclonal antibody (mAb) is conjugated to biologically active drugs through chemical linkers, have emerged as a promising class of anticancer treatment agents, being one of the fastest growing fields in cancer therapy. The failure of early ADCs led researchers to explore strategies to develop more effective and improved ADCs with lower levels of unconjugated mAbs and more\u2010stable linkers between the drug and the antibody, which show improved pharmacokinetic properties, therapeutic indexes, and safety profiles. Such improvements resulted in the US Food and Drug Administration approvals of brentuximab vedotin, trastuzumab emtansine, and, more recently, inotuzumab ozogamicin. In addition, recent clinical outcomes have sparked additional interest, which leads to the dramatically increased number of ADCs in clinical development. The present review explores ADCs, their main characteristics, and new research developments, as well as discusses strategies for the selection of the most appropriate target antigens, mAbs, cytotoxic drugs, linkers, and conjugation chemistries."

This new antibody-based molecular platform enables selective delivery of a potent cytotoxic payload to target cancer cells, resulting in improved efficacy, reduced systemic toxicity, and preferable pharmacokinetics (PK)/pharmacodynamics (PD) and biodistribution compared to traditional chemotherapy. Boosted by the successes of FDA-approved Adcetris\u00ae and Kadcyla\u00ae, this drug class has been rapidly growing along with about 60 ADCs currently in clinical trials. In this article, we briefly review molecular aspects of each component (the antibody, payload, and linker) of ADCs, and then mainly discuss traditional and new technologies of the conjugation and linker chemistries for successful construction of clinically effective ADCs. Current efforts in the conjugation and linker chemistries will provide greater insights into molecular design and strategies for clinically effective ADCs from medicinal chemistry and pharmacology standpoints. The development of site-specific conjugation methodologies for constructing homogeneous ADCs is an especially promising path to improving ADC design, which will open the way for novel cancer therapeutics."

This new antibody-based molecular platform enables selective delivery of a potent cytotoxic payload to target cancer cells, resulting in improved efficacy, reduced systemic toxicity, and preferable pharmacokinetics (PK)/pharmacodynamics (PD) and biodistribution compared to traditional chemotherapy. Boosted by the successes of FDA-approved Adcetris\u00ae and Kadcyla\u00ae, this drug class has been rapidly growing along with about 60 ADCs currently in clinical trials. In this article, we briefly review molecular aspects of each component (the antibody, payload, and linker) of ADCs, and then mainly discuss traditional and new technologies of the conjugation and linker chemistries for successful construction of clinically effective ADCs. Current efforts in the conjugation and linker chemistries will provide greater insights into molecular design and strategies for clinically effective ADCs from medicinal chemistry and pharmacology standpoints. The development of site-specific conjugation methodologies for constructing homogeneous ADCs is an especially promising path to improving ADC design, which will open the way for novel cancer therapeutics.",

The properties of the linker between the antibody and the payload are proven to be critical to the success of an ADC. Although ADC linkers can be 'non-cleavable', the vast majority of ADCs in clinical development have specific release mechanisms to allow controlled linker cleavage at the target site and are thus termed 'cleavable'. In recent years, the development of new methods of drug release from ADCs has continued in parallel to the deepening understanding of the biological processes underlying the mechanisms of action of pre-existing technologies. This review summarises the advances in the field of cleavable linker technologies for ADCs.",

This review will focus on FDA-approved and late-stage ADCs, their limitations including their toxicity and associated resistance mechanisms, as well as new emerging strategies to address these issues and attempt to widen their therapeutic window.

Despite the efficacy of anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies, concurrent chemotherapy is still needed to maximize response. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are a class of therapeutics that combines an antigen-specific antibody backbone with a potent cytotoxic payload, resulting in an improved therapeutic index. Two anti-HER2 ADCs have been approved by the FDA with different indications in HER2-positive breast cancer. Ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) was the first-in-class HER2-targeting ADC, initially approved in 2013 for metastatic patients who previously received trastuzumab and a taxane, and the label was expanded in 2019 to include adjuvant treatment of high-risk patients with residual disease after neoadjuvant taxane and trastuzumab-based therapy. In 2020, trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) was the second approved ADC for patients who had received at least 2 lines of anti-HER2-based therapy in the metastatic setting. The success of these two agents has transformed the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer and has re-energized the field of ADC development. Given their advanced pharmaceutical properties, next-generation HER2-targeted ADCs have the potential to be active beyond traditional HER2-positive breast cancer and may be effective in cells with low expression of HER2 or ERBB2 mutations, opening a spectrum of new possible clinical applications. Ongoing challenges include improving target-specificity, optimizing the toxicity profile, and identifying biomarkers for patient selection. The aim of this review is to summarize the principal molecular, clinical, and safety characteristics of approved and experimental anti-HER2 ADCs, contextualizing the current and future landscape of drug development."

Currently, there are 40 ADCs in various phases of clinical development. However, only 34 of these have published their structures. Of the 34 disclosed structures, 24 of them use a linkage to the thiol of cysteines on the monoclonal antibody. The remaining 10 candidates utilize chemistry to surface lysines of the antibody. Due to the inherent heterogeneity of conjugation to the multiple lysines or cysteines found in mAbs, significant research efforts are now being directed toward the production of discrete, homogeneous ADC products, via site-specific conjugation. These site-specific conjugations may involve genetic engineering of the mAb to introduce discrete, available cysteines or non-natural amino acids with an orthogonally-reactive functional group handle such as an aldehyde, ketone, azido, or alkynyl tag. These site-specific approaches not only increase the homogeneity of ADCs but also enable novel bio-orthogonal chemistries that utilize reactive moieties other than thiol or amine. This broadens the diversity of linkers that can be utilized which will lead to better linker design in future generations of ADCs."

A conjugate of a calicheamicin hydrazide derivative attached via hydrazone formation to the oxidized carbohydrates of the anti-CD33 murine antibody P67.6 had been chosen for use in AML prior to humanization of this antibody. However, the CDR-grafted humanized P67.6 could not be used to make the carbohydrate conjugate because of the unexpected sensitivity of this antibody to periodate oxidation. Exploration of a series of bifunctional linkers resulted in a new class of calicheamicin conjugates, termed the hybrid conjugates, that allows for the attachment of the calicheamicin to lysines but incorporates the site of hydrolytic release, a hydrazone, previously shown to be required for activity. The optimized conjugate chosen for clinical trials, gemtuzumab ozogamicin (\"gem-ozo\", Mylotarg, formerly designated CMA-676), was significantly more potent and selective than the carbohydrate conjugate it replaced. It was selectively cytotoxic to HL-60 leukemia cells in tissue culture with an IC(50) in the low to sub-pg cal/mL range (cal = calicheamicin equivalents). Doses of gem-ozo as low as 50 microg cal/kg given three times to mice bearing HL-60 xenografts routinely resulted in long-term, tumor-free survivors, while a nonbinding control conjugate was relatively inactive. Gem-ozo at a concentration of 2 to 10 ng cal/mL selectively inhibited leukemia colony formation by marrow cells from a significant proportion of AML patients. Gem-ozo has also shown significant activity against AML in Phase II trials and is the first antibody-targeted chemotherapeutic agent approved by the FDA."

Once bound to the target cell-surface antigen, the conjugate must be processed to release an active form of the drug, which can reach its intracellular target. Here, we used both biological and biochemical methods to better define this process for antibody-maytansinoid conjugates. In particular, we examined the metabolic fate in cells of huC242-maytansinoid conjugates containing either a disulfide linker (huC242-SPDB-DM4) or a thioether linker (huC242-SMCC-DM1). Using cell cycle analysis combined with lysosomal inhibitors, we showed that lysosomal processing is required for the activity of antibody-maytansinoid conjugates, irrespective of the linker. We also identified and characterized the released maytansinoid molecules from these conjugates, and measured their rate of release compared with the kinetics of cell cycle arrest. Both conjugates are efficiently degraded in lysosomes to yield metabolites consisting of the intact maytansinoid drug and linker attached to lysine. The lysine adduct is the sole metabolite from the thioether-linked conjugate. However, the lysine metabolite generated from the disulfide-linked conjugate is reduced and S-methylated to yield the lipophilic and potently cytotoxic metabolite, S-methyl-DM4. These findings provide insight into the mechanism of action of antibody-maytansinoid conjugates in general, and more specifically, identify a biochemical mechanism that may account for the significantly enhanced antitumor efficacy observed with disulfide-linked conjugates."

                "text": "\nAntibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) represent a targeted therapeutic approach that combines the specificity of monoclonal antibodies with the potency of cytotoxic drugs. At the core of this technology are linkers, which serve as the chemical bridges connecting the antibody to the cytotoxic payload. The linker component is not merely a passive connector but a sophisticated design element that significantly influences an ADC's performance upon intravenous administration.\n\nLinkers in ADCs must fulfill seemingly contradictory requirements: they must maintain stability in systemic circulation to prevent premature drug release while ensuring efficient payload delivery at the target site. This \"stability paradox\" represents one of the most critical challenges in ADC development. Early-generation ADCs often suffered from linker instability issues that led to premature payload release in circulation, resulting in off-target toxicity and reduced efficacy. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">\n\nThe chemical composition of linkers varies widely, with common classifications including cleavable linkers (such as acid-sensitive hydrazones, enzyme-sensitive peptides, and disulfide linkers) and non-cleavable linkers (such as thioether bonds). Each type offers distinct advantages and limitations regarding stability, release kinetics, and payload delivery efficiency. The selection of an appropriate linker chemistry depends on multiple factors including the antibody properties, payload characteristics, and the physiological environment of the target tissue. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">\n\nAdvanced linker technologies have emerged to address specific challenges, including branched linkers that enable higher drug-to-antibody ratios (DARs) without compromising stability, and self-immolative spacers that facilitate efficient payload release after initial cleavage events. These innovations have contributed significantly to the improved therapeutic index observed in newer-generation ADCs. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">",

Furthermore, studies show that noncleavable linkers perform far better in vivo, with payload release occurring primarily in the lysosome following ADC internalisation and destruction of both the antibody and the linker (Fig. 2).

As a result, non-cleavable linkers may offer a wider therapeutic window, as well as increased stability and tolerability [53].\n\nThe systemic stability of ADCs post administration is one of the crucial issues to ensure the efficacy of ADCs, and several strategic approaches are taken for overcoming this issue.

A linker is the required covalent connection between the cytotoxic compound and the antibody. The linker influences the stability and drug to antibody ratio (DAR) of the therapeutic agent. These parameters are critical for the overall success of an ADC-based design. With the high potency of the payloads chosen, linkers must be stable within the bloodstream to limit early payload release and allow tumour site targeting to occur. However, this stability must be context-dependent: once inside the cell, these linkers must be efficient in releasing the payload to induced the cytotoxic effect (Senter, 2009)."

However, a clinical study revealed reverse correlation between linker stability of maytansinoid-based ADCs and adverse toxicity (Drake and Rabuka, 2015).

                            "The systemic stability of the antibody\u2212drug linker is also crucial for delivery of an intact ADC to targetexpressing tumors. Linkers stable in circulation but readily processed in the target cell are necessary for both safety and potency of the delivered conjugate [48]. In general, linker should be stable enough in systemic circulation to deliver drug into tumor cells, but labile to release this fully active payload drug inside the tumor cells. Otherwise, the toxic drug could be released in the bloodstream, causing systemic toxicity. Polson et al. demonstrated that non-cleavable linker (e.g.  is more stable than cleavable linker (e.g. T-DM1) [49]. The non-cleavable linker may have slower deconjugation or lower clearance than cleavable linker and reduced systemic toxicity of ADC in rats presumably due to the reduced release of free drug or other toxic metabolites into the circulation [49]. This is because the cleavable linkers may release drug by lysosomal proteases without the degradation of the mAb component whereas non-cleavable linkers require catabolism of the mAb backbones to release the drug [9 and ref. therein]. In addition, the selection of attachment site can affect stability of cleavable antibody-drug conjugates, as demonstrated in the design of systemically stable cleavable auristatin-based conjugates, offering the means to overcome inherent linker instability by optimal attachment site [48]."

                            "The choice of suitable linkers is likewise the challenge for the development of effective ADCs. As a small and central part of ADCs, a linker is designed to be stable in the bloodstream and subsequently release the drug in its active form within or close to the target cells (Alley et al., 2008)(Nagayama et al., 2017). The role of linker is fundamental for efficient delivery of the cytotoxic drug, but it is also the determinant factor to the toxicity of an ADC product. Premature release of drugs in the circulation can result in systemic toxicity and a lower therapeutic index. \n\nNeutropenia is a kind of common toxicity for many ADCs conjugated to MMAE via protease cleavable valine-citrulline linkers such as Brentuximab vedotin, ASG-5ME, Glembatumumab vedotin, Indusatumab vedotin, Polatuzumab vedotin and PSMA-targeting ADC (Beck et al., 2017)(Coveler et al., 2016)(Goeij et al., 2016)(Donaghy, 2016)(Hinrichs et al., 2015)(Younes et al., 2012). Results showed that vc-MMAE-based ADC-induced neutropenia is due to a direct cytotoxic effect of released payload on differentiated neutrophils in the bone marrow (Zhao et al., 2017). Peripheral neuropathy is another important target-independent clinical toxicity associated with microtubule inhibitor ADCs leading to treatment discontinuation and/or dose reduction (Litvak-Greenfeld et al., 2012). Microtubule inhibitors disrupt interphase microtubule function critical for the active transport of key essential proteins from the neuron cell body to distal synapses and ultimately result in peripheral neuropathy (Starobova et al., 2017)."

In phase I studies, brentuximab vedotin demonstrated significant activity with a favorable safety profile in patients with relapsed or refractory CD30-positive lymphomas.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nIn this multinational, open-label, phase II study, the efficacy and safety of brentuximab vedotin were evaluated in patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) after autologous stem-cell transplantation (auto-SCT). Patients had histologically documented CD30-positive HL by central pathology review. A total of 102 patients were treated with brentuximab vedotin 1.8 mg/kg by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks. In the absence of disease progression or prohibitive toxicity, patients received a maximum of 16 cycles. The primary end point was the overall objective response rate (ORR) determined by an independent radiology review facility.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe ORR was 75% with complete remission (CR) in 34% of patients. The median progression-free survival time for all patients was 5.6 months, and the median duration of response for those in CR was 20.5 months. After a median observation time of more than 1.5 years, 31 patients were alive and free of documented progressive disease. The most common treatment-related adverse events were peripheral sensory neuropathy, nausea, fatigue, neutropenia, and diarrhea.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe ADC brentuximab vedotin was associated with manageable toxicity and induced objective responses in 75% of patients with relapsed or refractory HL after auto-SCT. Durable CRs approaching 2 years were observed, supporting study in earlier lines of therapy."

                            "Chemotherapy-induced neuropathy is a common, dose-dependent adverse effect of several antineoplastics. It can lead to detrimental dose reductions and discontinuation of treatment, and severely affects the quality of life of cancer survivors. Clinically, chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy presents as deficits in sensory, motor, and autonomic function which develop in a glove and stocking distribution due to preferential effects on longer axons. The pathophysiological processes are multi-factorial and involve oxidative stress, apoptotic mechanisms, altered calcium homeostasis, axon degeneration and membrane remodeling as well as immune processes and neuroinflammation. This review focusses on the commonly used antineoplastic substances oxaliplatin, cisplatin, vincristine, docetaxel, and paclitaxel which interfere with the cancer cell cycle\u2014leading to cell death and tumor degradation\u2014and cause severe acute and chronic peripheral neuropathies. We discuss drug mechanism of action and pharmacokinetic disposition relevant to the development of peripheral neuropathy, the epidemiology and clinical presentation of chemotherapy-induced neuropathy, emerging insight into genetic susceptibilities as well as current understanding of the pathophysiology and treatment approaches."

                            "The linker component of antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) is a key feature in developing optimized therapeutic agents that are highly active at well tolerated doses. For maximal intratumoral drug delivery, linkers are required that are highly stable in the systemic circulation, yet allow for efficient drug release at the target site. In this respect, amide bond-based technologies constitute a technological advancement, since the linker half-lives in circulation ( t 1/2 approximately 7 days) are much longer than earlier generation linkers that break down within 1-2 days. The amide linkers, some of which contain peptides, are appended to the mAb carriers through thioether/maleimide adducts. Here, we describe that use of a bromoacetamidecaproyl (bac) in place of the maleimidocaproyl (mc) increases the plasma stability of resulting thioether ADCs. One such ADC, 1F6-C4v2-bac-MMAF, which is directed against the CD70 antigen on lymphomas and renal cell carcinoma, was prepared containing a bac thioether spacer between the drug (MMAF) and the mAb carrier (1F6-C4v2). There was no measurable systemic drug release from this ADC for 2 weeks postadministration in mice. In order to assess the impact of improving linker stability beyond mc containing ADCs, a series of mc and bac-linked 1F6-MMAF conjugates were compared for tolerability, intratumoral drug delivery, and therapeutic efficacy in nude mice with renal cell carcinoma xenografts. There were no statistically significant efficacy differences between sets of mc and bac containing ADCs, although the bac linker technology led to 25% higher intratumoral drug exposure over a 7 day period compared to the corresponding mc linker. The mechanism of drug release from maleimide-adducts likely involves a retro-Michael reaction that takes place in plasma, based on in vitro studies demonstrating that some of the released drug-maleimide derivative became covalently bound to cysteine-34 of serum albumin. In summary, the data indicate that new linkers can be obtained with improved in vivo stability by replacing the maleimide with an acetamide, but the resulting ADCs had similar tolerability and activity profiles."

Studies examining non-cleavable linkers have revealed position-dependent degradation patterns that significantly impact efficacy. For instance, research on Amino-PEG6-based linkers carrying monomethyl auristatin D (MMAD) payloads demonstrated that certain conjugation sites led to degradation of the toxin's C-terminus in rodent plasma, which substantially reduced potency. Researchers found that this degradation could be prevented either by modifying the C-terminus of the payload or by carefully selecting appropriate conjugation sites, with both approaches resulting in improved stability and enhanced potency in both laboratory and animal models. <Paper corpusId=\"405679\" paperTitle=\"(Dorywalska et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nThe dual requirements for linker stability present a complex optimization challenge. Before reaching target cells, ADCs must maintain stability to minimize off-target toxicity and maximize tumor exposure to the payload. However, upon internalization into target cells, linkers must become sufficiently labile to ensure rapid and efficient release of the cytotoxic payload into the cytoplasm, where it can exert its mechanism of action on cellular components such as tubulin or DNA. <Paper corpusId=\"7704798\" paperTitle=\"(Feng et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper> This delicate balance between circulation stability and intracellular release kinetics directly impacts the overall efficacy profile of ADCs.\n\nSpecies differences in plasma composition can also affect linker stability and complicate the translation of preclinical efficacy data to clinical outcomes. Understanding these differences and controlling toxin degradation to optimize ADC stability in preclinical models is essential for making appropriate selections during development. <Paper corpusId=\"405679\" paperTitle=\"(Dorywalska et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper> These considerations highlight the importance of comprehensive stability assessment during ADC development to predict and optimize clinical efficacy.\n\nThe optimization of linker stability for maximum efficacy requires consideration of multiple factors, including the specific properties of the antibody, the mechanism of action of the payload, the target antigen biology, and the unique microenvironment of the tumor.

However, they remain susceptible to rapid hydrolysis by lysosomal enzymes like cathepsin B once internalized into target cells. <Paper corpusId=\"3581997\" paperTitle=\"(Hafeez et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\n2. **Glucuronide linkers**: These represent a newer generation of cleavable linkers with enhanced stability in systemic circulation compared to earlier designs. <Paper corpusId=\"235240827\" paperTitle=\"(Mahmood, 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nCleavable linkers must maintain a critical balance\u2014they need to remain stable enough in circulation to prevent premature payload release while being sufficiently labile to ensure efficient drug delivery once the ADC reaches its target cells. <Paper corpusId=\"266003384\" paperTitle=\"(Aggarwal et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"17562819\" paperTitle=\"(Jain et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\n## Non-Cleavable Linkers\n\nNon-cleavable linkers have become increasingly attractive in ADC development due to their superior plasma stability compared to cleavable alternatives. <Paper corpusId=\"251541751\" paperTitle=\"(Marei et al._1, 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"255852470\" paperTitle=\"(Marei et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> These linkers are characterized by stable chemical bonds that resist proteolytic degradation in circulation, such as:\n\n1. **Non-reducible thioether linkages (SMCC)**: These create stable connections that withstand the proteolytic environment of the bloodstream.\n\n2. **Maleimidocaproyl linkages**: These provide durable connections between antibody and payload. <Paper corpusId=\"266003384\" paperTitle=\"(Aggarwal et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nThe release mechanism for non-cleavable linkers differs fundamentally from cleavable ones. Payload release occurs primarily in lysosomes following ADC internalization and complete degradation of both the antibody and the linker. <Paper corpusId=\"251541751\" paperTitle=\"(Marei et al._1, 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"255852470\" paperTitle=\"(Marei et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> This distinct mechanism produces metabolites consisting of the intact drug with linker fragments attached to lysine residues, as observed with thioether-linked conjugates. <Paper corpusId=\"10886659\" paperTitle=\"(Erickson et al., 2006)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\n## Comparative Stability Profiles\n\nResearch has consistently demonstrated that non-cleavable linkers offer superior stability in plasma compared to cleavable alternatives. This enhanced stability provides several advantages:\n\n1. **Improved circulation half-life**: Non-cleavable linkers allow ADCs to remain intact longer in the bloodstream. <Paper corpusId=\"411843\" paperTitle=\"(Peters et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"10886659\" paperTitle=\"(Erickson et al., 2006)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\n2. **Reduced risk of systemic toxicity**: The greater stability minimizes premature payload release, resulting in fewer off-target effects and potentially a wider therapeutic window. <Paper corpusId=\"270803831\" paperTitle=\"(Chis et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"22057001\" paperTitle=\"(Tsuchikama et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\n3. **Enhanced safety profile**: Non-cleavable linkers generally demonstrate improved tolerability in clinical applications. <Paper corpusId=\"251541751\" paperTitle=\"(Marei et al._1, 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"255852470\" paperTitle=\"(Marei et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nHowever, the selection of linker type involves important trade-offs. While non-cleavable linkers provide superior stability, they generally exhibit reduced membrane permeability and require complete antibody degradation for payload release, which may impact efficacy in certain contexts. <Paper corpusId=\"266003384\" paperTitle=\"(Aggarwal et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> Conversely, cleavable linkers offer more efficient payload release mechanisms but at the potential cost of reduced plasma stability. <Paper corpusId=\"270803831\" paperTitle=\"(Chis et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"195879565\" paperTitle=\"(Bargh et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nThe drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) also influences stability, with heavily modified ADCs (those carrying eight drug molecules) demonstrating faster clearance from circulation and increased toxicity. Studies indicate that ADCs with moderate loading (2-4 drugs per antibody) achieve an optimal balance between stability, clearance rates, and potency. <Paper corpusId=\"411843\" paperTitle=\"(Peters et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nThe optimal linker design must therefore balance the dual requirements of circulation stability and appropriate payload release kinetics, which remains a critical consideration in ADC development. <Paper corpusId=\"270803831\" paperTitle=\"(Chis et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"236983785\" paperTitle=\"(Ferraro et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"221767754\" paperTitle=\"(Joubert et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>",

The linkers provide the stability of drug antibody conjugation in the circulation. Early generation ADC linkers were chemically labile linkers such as disulfides and hydrazones (Tsuchikama et al., 2016)(Tsuchikama et al., 2017)(Walles et al., 2018)(Thorpe et al., 1987)(Thorpe et al., 1988). These linkers were unstable in the circulation with short half-lives, generally one to two days. The recent generation of linkers are more stable in the systemic circulation such as peptide and glucuronide linkers."

                            "CD33 is expressed by acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells in >80% of patients but not by normal hematopoietic stem cells, suggesting that elimination of CD33(+) cells may be therapeutically beneficial. A conjugate of a calicheamicin hydrazide derivative attached via hydrazone formation to the oxidized carbohydrates of the anti-CD33 murine antibody P67.6 had been chosen for use in AML prior to humanization of this antibody. However, the CDR-grafted humanized P67.6 could not be used to make the carbohydrate conjugate because of the unexpected sensitivity of this antibody to periodate oxidation. Exploration of a series of bifunctional linkers resulted in a new class of calicheamicin conjugates, termed the hybrid conjugates, that allows for the attachment of the calicheamicin to lysines but incorporates the site of hydrolytic release, a hydrazone, previously shown to be required for activity. The optimized conjugate chosen for clinical trials, gemtuzumab ozogamicin (\"gem-ozo\", Mylotarg, formerly designated CMA-676), was significantly more potent and selective than the carbohydrate conjugate it replaced. It was selectively cytotoxic to HL-60 leukemia cells in tissue culture with an IC(50) in the low to sub-pg cal/mL range (cal = calicheamicin equivalents). Doses of gem-ozo as low as 50 microg cal/kg given three times to mice bearing HL-60 xenografts routinely resulted in long-term, tumor-free survivors, while a nonbinding control conjugate was relatively inactive. Gem-ozo at a concentration of 2 to 10 ng cal/mL selectively inhibited leukemia colony formation by marrow cells from a significant proportion of AML patients. Gem-ozo has also shown significant activity against AML in Phase II trials and is the first antibody-targeted chemotherapeutic agent approved by the FDA."

                            "Antibody-drug conjugates are targeted anticancer agents consisting of a cytotoxic drug covalently linked to a monoclonal antibody for tumor antigen-specific activity. Once bound to the target cell-surface antigen, the conjugate must be processed to release an active form of the drug, which can reach its intracellular target. Here, we used both biological and biochemical methods to better define this process for antibody-maytansinoid conjugates. In particular, we examined the metabolic fate in cells of huC242-maytansinoid conjugates containing either a disulfide linker (huC242-SPDB-DM4) or a thioether linker (huC242-SMCC-DM1). Using cell cycle analysis combined with lysosomal inhibitors, we showed that lysosomal processing is required for the activity of antibody-maytansinoid conjugates, irrespective of the linker. We also identified and characterized the released maytansinoid molecules from these conjugates, and measured their rate of release compared with the kinetics of cell cycle arrest. Both conjugates are efficiently degraded in lysosomes to yield metabolites consisting of the intact maytansinoid drug and linker attached to lysine. The lysine adduct is the sole metabolite from the thioether-linked conjugate. However, the lysine metabolite generated from the disulfide-linked conjugate is reduced and S-methylated to yield the lipophilic and potently cytotoxic metabolite, S-methyl-DM4. These findings provide insight into the mechanism of action of antibody-maytansinoid conjugates in general, and more specifically, identify a biochemical mechanism that may account for the significantly enhanced antitumor efficacy observed with disulfide-linked conjugates."

Instability of the linker causes premature liberation of the toxic payload and undesired damage to non-target healthy cells, which can lead to systemic toxicity and adverse effects. However, a clinical study revealed reverse correlation between linker stability of maytansinoid-based ADCs and adverse toxicity (Drake and Rabuka, 2015). Therefore, it is important to identify ADC linkers with optimal linker stability for each combination of antigen, target tumor type, and payload."

The properties of the linker between the antibody and the payload are proven to be critical to the success of an ADC. Although ADC linkers can be 'non-cleavable', the vast majority of ADCs in clinical development have specific release mechanisms to allow controlled linker cleavage at the target site and are thus termed 'cleavable'. In recent years, the development of new methods of drug release from ADCs has continued in parallel to the deepening understanding of the biological processes underlying the mechanisms of action of pre-existing technologies. This review summarises the advances in the field of cleavable linker technologies for ADCs."

                            "The development of anti-HER2 agents has been one of the most meaningful advancements in the management of metastatic breast cancer, significantly improving survival outcomes. Despite the efficacy of anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies, concurrent chemotherapy is still needed to maximize response. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are a class of therapeutics that combines an antigen-specific antibody backbone with a potent cytotoxic payload, resulting in an improved therapeutic index. Two anti-HER2 ADCs have been approved by the FDA with different indications in HER2-positive breast cancer. Ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) was the first-in-class HER2-targeting ADC, initially approved in 2013 for metastatic patients who previously received trastuzumab and a taxane, and the label was expanded in 2019 to include adjuvant treatment of high-risk patients with residual disease after neoadjuvant taxane and trastuzumab-based therapy. In 2020, trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) was the second approved ADC for patients who had received at least 2 lines of anti-HER2-based therapy in the metastatic setting. The success of these two agents has transformed the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer and has re-energized the field of ADC development. Given their advanced pharmaceutical properties, next-generation HER2-targeted ADCs have the potential to be active beyond traditional HER2-positive breast cancer and may be effective in cells with low expression of HER2 or ERBB2 mutations, opening a spectrum of new possible clinical applications. Ongoing challenges include improving target-specificity, optimizing the toxicity profile, and identifying biomarkers for patient selection. The aim of this review is to summarize the principal molecular, clinical, and safety characteristics of approved and experimental anti-HER2 ADCs, contextualizing the current and future landscape of drug development."

Strop et al. created an ADC with an average DAR ~1.7, but directed conjugation using a novel enzymatic conjugation to precise points on the antibody backbone to create homogenous solutions (Strop et al., 2013). Their study reported how the site of conjugation affected linker stability in a species-dependent manner, where conjugation on the light chain appears to be cleaved more quickly compared to heavy chain conjugation in mice, but stable in rats (Strop et al., 2013). Additionally, heavy chain conjugation demonstrated dramatically different PK and faster rate of drug loss, compared to either light chain conjugated ADCs or naked mAbs in rats (Strop et al., 2013)."

                            "The systemic stability of the antibody\u2212drug linker is also crucial for delivery of an intact ADC to targetexpressing tumors. Linkers stable in circulation but readily processed in the target cell are necessary for both safety and potency of the delivered conjugate [48]. In general, linker should be stable enough in systemic circulation to deliver drug into tumor cells, but labile to release this fully active payload drug inside the tumor cells. Otherwise, the toxic drug could be released in the bloodstream, causing systemic toxicity. Polson et al. demonstrated that non-cleavable linker (e.g.  is more stable than cleavable linker (e.g. T-DM1) [49]. The non-cleavable linker may have slower deconjugation or lower clearance than cleavable linker and reduced systemic toxicity of ADC in rats presumably due to the reduced release of free drug or other toxic metabolites into the circulation [49]. This is because the cleavable linkers may release drug by lysosomal proteases without the degradation of the mAb component whereas non-cleavable linkers require catabolism of the mAb backbones to release the drug [9 and ref. therein]. In addition, the selection of attachment site can affect stability of cleavable antibody-drug conjugates, as demonstrated in the design of systemically stable cleavable auristatin-based conjugates, offering the means to overcome inherent linker instability by optimal attachment site [48]."

                            "Conjugation of small molecule payloads to cysteine residues on proteins via a disulfide bond represents an attractive strategy to generate redox-sensitive bioconjugates, which have value as potential diagnostic reagents or therapeutics. Advancement of such \"direct-disulfide\" bioconjugates to the clinic necessitates chemical methods to form disulfide connections efficiently, without byproducts. The disulfide connection must also be resistant to premature cleavage by thiols prior to arrival at the targeted tissue. We show here that commonly employed methods to generate direct disulfide-linked bioconjugates are inadequate for addressing these challenges. We describe our efforts to optimize direct-disulfide conjugation chemistry, focusing on the generation of conjugates between cytotoxic payloads and cysteine-engineered antibodies (i.e., THIOMAB antibody-drug conjugates, or TDCs). This work culminates in the development of novel, high-yielding conjugation chemistry for creating direct payload disulfide connections to any of several Cys mutation sites in THIOMAB antibodies or to Cys sites in other biomolecules (e.g., human serum albumin and cell-penetrating peptides). We conclude by demonstrating that hindered direct disulfide TDCs with two methyl groups adjacent to the disulfide, which have heretofore not been described for any bioconjugate, are more stable and more efficacious in mouse tumor xenograft studies than less hindered analogs."

                            "Valine\u2013citrulline linkers are commonly used as enzymatically cleavable linkers for antibody\u2013drug conjugates. While stable in human plasma, these linkers are unstable in mouse plasma due to susceptibility to an extracellular carboxylesterase. This instability often triggers premature release of drugs in mouse circulation, presenting a molecular design challenge. Here, we report that an antibody\u2013drug conjugate with glutamic acid\u2013valine\u2013citrulline linkers is responsive to enzymatic drug release but undergoes almost no premature cleavage in mice. We demonstrate that this construct exhibits greater treatment efficacy in mouse tumor models than does a valine\u2013citrulline-based variant. Notably, our antibody\u2013drug conjugate contains long spacers facilitating the protease access to the linker moiety, indicating that our linker assures high in vivo stability despite a high degree of exposure. This technology could add flexibility to antibody\u2013drug conjugate design and help minimize failure rates in pre-clinical studies caused by linker instability. The valine-citrulline dipeptide, which is used as a cleavable linker for antibody-drug conjugates, is instable in mouse plasma. Here, the authors developed a glutamic acid\u2013valine\u2013citrulline tripeptide sequence as a stable alternative that still is susceptible to cathepsin-mediated cleavage."

                            "Previous investigations on antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) stability have focused on drug release by linker-deconjugation due to the relatively stable payloads such as maytansines. Recent development of ADCs has been focused on exploring technologies to produce homogeneous ADCs and new classes of payloads to expand the mechanisms of action of the delivered drugs. Certain new ADC payloads could undergo metabolism in circulation while attached to antibodies and thus affect ADC stability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy and toxicity profiles. Herein, we investigate payload stability specifically and seek general guidelines to address payload metabolism and therefore increase the overall ADC stability. Investigation was performed on various payloads with different functionalities (e.g., PNU-159682 analog, tubulysin, cryptophycin, and taxoid) using different conjugation sites (HC-A118C, LC-K149C, and HC-A140C) on THIOMAB antibodies. We were able to reduce metabolism and inactivation of a broad range of payloads of THIOMAB antibody-drug conjugates by employing optimal conjugation sites (LC-K149C and HC-A140C). Additionally, further payload stability was achieved by optimizing the linkers. Coupling relatively stable sites with optimized linkers provided optimal stability and reduction of payloads metabolism in circulation in vivo."

However, when dysregulated, these enzymes contribute to the progression of multiple diseases, with cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, inflammation, and blood disorders being the most prominent examples. For a long time, disease\u2010associated proteases have been used for the activation of various prodrugs due to their well\u2010characterized catalytic activity and ability to selectively cleave only those substrates that strictly correspond with their active site architecture. To date, versatile peptide sequences that are cleaved by proteases in a site\u2010specific manner have been utilized as bioactive linkers for the targeted delivery of multiple types of cargo, including fluorescent dyes, photosensitizers, cytotoxic drugs, antibiotics, and pro\u2010antibodies. This platform is highly adaptive, as multiple protease\u2010labile conjugates have already been developed, some of which are currently in clinical use for cancer treatment. In this review, recent advancements in the development of novel protease\u2010cleavable linkers for selective drug delivery are described. Moreover, the current limitations regarding the selectivity of linkers are discussed, and the future perspectives that rely on the application of unnatural amino acids for the development of highly selective peptide linkers are also presented."

                            "Although peptide motifs represent the majority of cleavable linkers used in clinical-stage antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), the sequences are often sensitive to cleavage by extracellular enzymes, such as elastase, leading to systemic release of the cytotoxic payload. This action reduces the therapeutic index by causing off-target toxicities that can be dose-limiting. For example, a common side-effect of ADCs made using peptide-cleavable linkers is myelosuppression, including neutropenia",

Advancement of such \"direct-disulfide\" bioconjugates to the clinic necessitates chemical methods to form disulfide connections efficiently, without byproducts. The disulfide connection must also be resistant to premature cleavage by thiols prior to arrival at the targeted tissue. We show here that commonly employed methods to generate direct disulfide-linked bioconjugates are inadequate for addressing these challenges. We describe our efforts to optimize direct-disulfide conjugation chemistry, focusing on the generation of conjugates between cytotoxic payloads and cysteine-engineered antibodies (i.e., THIOMAB antibody-drug conjugates, or TDCs). This work culminates in the development of novel, high-yielding conjugation chemistry for creating direct payload disulfide connections to any of several Cys mutation sites in THIOMAB antibodies or to Cys sites in other biomolecules (e.g., human serum albumin and cell-penetrating peptides). We conclude by demonstrating that hindered direct disulfide TDCs with two methyl groups adjacent to the disulfide, which have heretofore not been described for any bioconjugate, are more stable and more efficacious in mouse tumor xenograft studies than less hindered analogs."

                            "Previous investigations on antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) stability have focused on drug release by linker-deconjugation due to the relatively stable payloads such as maytansines. Recent development of ADCs has been focused on exploring technologies to produce homogeneous ADCs and new classes of payloads to expand the mechanisms of action of the delivered drugs. Certain new ADC payloads could undergo metabolism in circulation while attached to antibodies and thus affect ADC stability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy and toxicity profiles. Herein, we investigate payload stability specifically and seek general guidelines to address payload metabolism and therefore increase the overall ADC stability. Investigation was performed on various payloads with different functionalities (e.g., PNU-159682 analog, tubulysin, cryptophycin, and taxoid) using different conjugation sites (HC-A118C, LC-K149C, and HC-A140C) on THIOMAB antibodies. We were able to reduce metabolism and inactivation of a broad range of payloads of THIOMAB antibody-drug conjugates by employing optimal conjugation sites (LC-K149C and HC-A140C). Additionally, further payload stability was achieved by optimizing the linkers. Coupling relatively stable sites with optimized linkers provided optimal stability and reduction of payloads metabolism in circulation in vivo."

                            "Valine\u2013citrulline linkers are commonly used as enzymatically cleavable linkers for antibody\u2013drug conjugates. While stable in human plasma, these linkers are unstable in mouse plasma due to susceptibility to an extracellular carboxylesterase. This instability often triggers premature release of drugs in mouse circulation, presenting a molecular design challenge. Here, we report that an antibody\u2013drug conjugate with glutamic acid\u2013valine\u2013citrulline linkers is responsive to enzymatic drug release but undergoes almost no premature cleavage in mice. We demonstrate that this construct exhibits greater treatment efficacy in mouse tumor models than does a valine\u2013citrulline-based variant. Notably, our antibody\u2013drug conjugate contains long spacers facilitating the protease access to the linker moiety, indicating that our linker assures high in vivo stability despite a high degree of exposure. This technology could add flexibility to antibody\u2013drug conjugate design and help minimize failure rates in pre-clinical studies caused by linker instability. The valine-citrulline dipeptide, which is used as a cleavable linker for antibody-drug conjugates, is instable in mouse plasma. Here, the authors developed a glutamic acid\u2013valine\u2013citrulline tripeptide sequence as a stable alternative that still is susceptible to cathepsin-mediated cleavage."

Instability of the linker causes premature liberation of the toxic payload and undesired damage to non-target healthy cells, which can lead to systemic toxicity and adverse effects. However, a clinical study revealed reverse correlation between linker stability of maytansinoid-based ADCs and adverse toxicity (Drake and Rabuka, 2015). Therefore, it is important to identify ADC linkers with optimal linker stability for each combination of antigen, target tumor type, and payload."

                            "The development of anti-HER2 agents has been one of the most meaningful advancements in the management of metastatic breast cancer, significantly improving survival outcomes. Despite the efficacy of anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies, concurrent chemotherapy is still needed to maximize response. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are a class of therapeutics that combines an antigen-specific antibody backbone with a potent cytotoxic payload, resulting in an improved therapeutic index. Two anti-HER2 ADCs have been approved by the FDA with different indications in HER2-positive breast cancer. Ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) was the first-in-class HER2-targeting ADC, initially approved in 2013 for metastatic patients who previously received trastuzumab and a taxane, and the label was expanded in 2019 to include adjuvant treatment of high-risk patients with residual disease after neoadjuvant taxane and trastuzumab-based therapy. In 2020, trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) was the second approved ADC for patients who had received at least 2 lines of anti-HER2-based therapy in the metastatic setting. The success of these two agents has transformed the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer and has re-energized the field of ADC development. Given their advanced pharmaceutical properties, next-generation HER2-targeted ADCs have the potential to be active beyond traditional HER2-positive breast cancer and may be effective in cells with low expression of HER2 or ERBB2 mutations, opening a spectrum of new possible clinical applications. Ongoing challenges include improving target-specificity, optimizing the toxicity profile, and identifying biomarkers for patient selection. The aim of this review is to summarize the principal molecular, clinical, and safety characteristics of approved and experimental anti-HER2 ADCs, contextualizing the current and future landscape of drug development."

The properties of the linker between the antibody and the payload are proven to be critical to the success of an ADC. Although ADC linkers can be 'non-cleavable', the vast majority of ADCs in clinical development have specific release mechanisms to allow controlled linker cleavage at the target site and are thus termed 'cleavable'. In recent years, the development of new methods of drug release from ADCs has continued in parallel to the deepening understanding of the biological processes underlying the mechanisms of action of pre-existing technologies. This review summarises the advances in the field of cleavable linker technologies for ADCs."
