The chemical space of carriers ranges from small cationic lipids applied in lipoplexes and lipid nanoparticles, over medium-sized sequence-defined xenopeptides, to macromolecular polycations applied in polyplexes and polymer micelles. This perspective highlights the discovery of distinct virus-inspired dynamic processes that capitalize on mutual nanoparticle\u2013host interactions to achieve potent RNA delivery. From the host side, subtle alterations of pH, ion concentration, redox potential, presence of specific proteins, receptors, or enzymes are cues, which must be recognized by the RNA nanocarrier via dynamic chemical designs including cleavable bonds, alterable physicochemical properties, and supramolecular assembly\u2013disassembly processes to respond to changing biological microenvironment during delivery.",

Inherently, LNPs contain at least five additional kinds of dynamic elements that determine their potency in a bioresponsive fashion; i) a PEG-lipid that, based on short (commonly dimyristyl) lipid anchors, is sheddable upon interaction with serum proteins in blood circulation; ii) a cholesterol/phosphatidylcholine envelope that triggers the formation of an apolipoprotein E-rich surface protein corona, facilitating receptor-mediated endocytosis into liver hepatocytes via the low-density lipoprotein receptor; iii) a cationizable tertiary amine-containing lipid (Fig. 1A), which after cellular uptake into acidifying endosomes becomes positively charged and changes physical properties; iv) interaction of cationized and anionic lipids trigger membrane destabilization promoting crossing of the endosomal barrier (Fig. 1B); and v) merging nanoparticle lipids with the cellular lipid membrane lead to release of the nucleic acid payload into the cytosol to a significant extent in carrier-free, bioavailable form (32)(33)(34). Consequently, the LNP composition strongly influences protein corona formation, endogenous receptor targeting, and functional activity (35). \n\nAs multicomponent assemblies, LNPs can be improved by combinatorial variation of phospholipids, PEG-lipid, cholesterol analogs, and/or the ionizable lipid. Optimizing the cationizable lipid structure (Fig. 1A) by modifying hydrophilic head group and hydrophobic tails, optionally including degradable bonds, was key for the LNP efficacy (27,(36)(37)(38). First breakthrough was the replacement of permanent cationic lipids such as DOTMA or DOTAP by ionizable tertiary amine-containing lipids. The dynamic reversible protonation both enhances efficacy and eliminates potential toxicity problems of permanently cationic materials.",

The chemical space of carriers ranges from small cationic lipids applied in lipoplexes and lipid nanoparticles, over medium-sized sequence-defined xenopeptides, to macromolecular polycations applied in polyplexes and polymer micelles. This perspective highlights the discovery of distinct virus-inspired dynamic processes that capitalize on mutual nanoparticle\u2013host interactions to achieve potent RNA delivery. From the host side, subtle alterations of pH, ion concentration, redox potential, presence of specific proteins, receptors, or enzymes are cues, which must be recognized by the RNA nanocarrier via dynamic chemical designs including cleavable bonds, alterable physicochemical properties, and supramolecular assembly\u2013disassembly processes to respond to changing biological microenvironment during delivery.\n## Dynamic Lipoplexes and LNPs\nIn the second maturation step, removal of ethanol by dialysis against physiological buffer (pH 7.4) deprotonates the ionizable lipid and stabilizes LNPs. Inherently, LNPs contain at least five additional kinds of dynamic elements that determine their potency in a bioresponsive fashion; i) a PEG-lipid that, based on short (commonly dimyristyl) lipid anchors, is sheddable upon interaction with serum proteins in blood circulation; ii) a cholesterol/phosphatidylcholine envelope that triggers the formation of an apolipoprotein E-rich surface protein corona, facilitating receptor-mediated endocytosis into liver hepatocytes via the low-density lipoprotein receptor; iii) a cationizable tertiary amine-containing lipid (Fig. 1A), which after cellular uptake into acidifying endosomes becomes positively charged and changes physical properties; iv) interaction of cationized and anionic lipids trigger membrane destabilization promoting crossing of the endosomal barrier (Fig. 1B); and v) merging nanoparticle lipids with the cellular lipid membrane lead to release of the nucleic acid payload into the cytosol to a significant extent in carrier-free, bioavailable form (32)(33)(34). Consequently, the LNP composition strongly influences protein corona formation, endogenous receptor targeting, and functional activity (35). \n\nAs multicomponent assemblies, LNPs can be improved by combinatorial variation of phospholipids, PEG-lipid, cholesterol analogs, and/or the ionizable lipid. Optimizing the cationizable lipid structure (Fig. 1A) by modifying hydrophilic head group and hydrophobic tails, optionally including degradable bonds, was key for the LNP efficacy (27,(36)(37)(38). First breakthrough was the replacement of permanent cationic lipids such as DOTMA or DOTAP by ionizable tertiary amine-containing lipids. The dynamic reversible protonation both enhances efficacy and eliminates potential toxicity problems of permanently cationic materials.",

            "abstract": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have shown promise as a delivery system for nucleic acid-based therapeutics, including DNA, siRNA, and mRNA vaccines. The immune system plays a critical role in the response to these nanocarriers, with innate immune cells initiating an early response and adaptive immune cells mediating a more specific reaction, sometimes leading to potential adverse effects. Recent studies have shown that the innate immune response to LNPs is mediated by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and other pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which recognize the lipid components of the nanoparticles. This recognition can trigger the activation of inflammatory pathways and the production of cytokines and chemokines, leading to potential adverse effects such as fever, inflammation, and pain at the injection site. On the other hand, the adaptive immune response to LNPs appears to be primarily directed against the protein encoded by the mRNA cargo, with little evidence of an ongoing adaptive immune response to the components of the LNP itself. Understanding the relationship between LNPs and the immune system is critical for the development of safe and effective nucleic acid-based delivery systems. In fact, targeting the immune system is essential to develop effective vaccines, as well as therapies against cancer or infections. There is a lack of research in the literature that has systematically studied the factors that influence the interaction between LNPs and the immune system and further research is needed to better elucidate the mechanisms underlying the immune response to LNPs. In this review, we discuss LNPs\u2019 composition, physico-chemical properties, such as size, shape, and surface charge, and the protein corona formation which can affect the reactivity of the immune system, thus providing a guide for the research on new formulations that could gain a favorable efficacy/safety profile.",

                    "text": "When NPs enter the bloodstream, some biomolecules interact with the LNP surface, resulting in their encapsulation and leading to the formation of a corona. This corona is commonly known as protein corona (PC) due to the predominant presence of plasma proteins [38]. The PC formation is a spontaneous process that occurs rapidly thanks to noncovalent interactions between proteins and the LNP surface [119]. \n\nThe presence of PC influences many properties of LNPs such as surface charge, hydrophilic and hydrophobic characteristics, stability, targeting ability, aggregation phenomena, toxicity, and efficacy, and, when RNA or DNA are loaded in LNPs, the PC affected also their transfection efficiency [120,121]. Data published on PC-coated LNPs seem to conflict with each other; in fact, many researchers observed a reduction in the targeting ability of nanoparticles after the PC formation [122], an increase in LNP aggregation, a decrease in LNP stability, and the leakage of fluorophores used for LNP tracking in vivo [123] (Figure 6), while other researchers suggested that the PC formation could be favorable to obtain a specific LNP targeting [1]. \n\nThe PC composition is principally affected by the physico-chemical properties and the biological environment of LNPs; it is also important to underline that the administration of the same LNP formulation to different patients could result in a different interaction of LNP-PC, specific for everyone (depending, as example, on pathological conditions, gender, age, and administration site) [124,125]. The study of the PC seems to be important to obtain a better LNP formulation able to induce the desirable pharmacological effect on each patient [126]. \n\nMany studies demonstrated that a careful selection of the technique (or techniques) used to separate LNPs and PC components is one of the key factors in obtaining realistic results. In particular, LNPs resulted in low-dense soft materials that are hardly separable from the serum nanomaterials, including exosomes and HDL [123,127,128].",

Catenacci, Rachele Rossi, Francesca Sechi, Daniela Buonocore, Milena Sorrenti, S. Perteghella, Marco Peviani, M. Bonferoni\n## Abstract\nLipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have shown promise as a delivery system for nucleic acid-based therapeutics, including DNA, siRNA, and mRNA vaccines. The immune system plays a critical role in the response to these nanocarriers, with innate immune cells initiating an early response and adaptive immune cells mediating a more specific reaction, sometimes leading to potential adverse effects. Recent studies have shown that the innate immune response to LNPs is mediated by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and other pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which recognize the lipid components of the nanoparticles. This recognition can trigger the activation of inflammatory pathways and the production of cytokines and chemokines, leading to potential adverse effects such as fever, inflammation, and pain at the injection site. On the other hand, the adaptive immune response to LNPs appears to be primarily directed against the protein encoded by the mRNA cargo, with little evidence of an ongoing adaptive immune response to the components of the LNP itself. Understanding the relationship between LNPs and the immune system is critical for the development of safe and effective nucleic acid-based delivery systems. In fact, targeting the immune system is essential to develop effective vaccines, as well as therapies against cancer or infections. There is a lack of research in the literature that has systematically studied the factors that influence the interaction between LNPs and the immune system and further research is needed to better elucidate the mechanisms underlying the immune response to LNPs. In this review, we discuss LNPs\u2019 composition, physico-chemical properties, such as size, shape, and surface charge, and the protein corona formation which can affect the reactivity of the immune system, thus providing a guide for the research on new formulations that could gain a favorable efficacy/safety profile.\n## Protein Corona\nWhen NPs enter the bloodstream, some biomolecules interact with the LNP surface, resulting in their encapsulation and leading to the formation of a corona. This corona is commonly known as protein corona (PC) due to the predominant presence of plasma proteins [38]. The PC formation is a spontaneous process that occurs rapidly thanks to noncovalent interactions between proteins and the LNP surface [119]. \n\nThe presence of PC influences many properties of LNPs such as surface charge, hydrophilic and hydrophobic characteristics, stability, targeting ability, aggregation phenomena, toxicity, and efficacy, and, when RNA or DNA are loaded in LNPs, the PC affected also their transfection efficiency [120,121]. Data published on PC-coated LNPs seem to conflict with each other; in fact, many researchers observed a reduction in the targeting ability of nanoparticles after the PC formation [122], an increase in LNP aggregation, a decrease in LNP stability, and the leakage of fluorophores used for LNP tracking in vivo [123] (Figure 6), while other researchers suggested that the PC formation could be favorable to obtain a specific LNP targeting [1]. \n\nThe PC composition is principally affected by the physico-chemical properties and the biological environment of LNPs; it is also important to underline that the administration of the same LNP formulation to different patients could result in a different interaction of LNP-PC, specific for everyone (depending, as example, on pathological conditions, gender, age, and administration site) [124,125]. The study of the PC seems to be important to obtain a better LNP formulation able to induce the desirable pharmacological effect on each patient [126]. \n\nMany studies demonstrated that a careful selection of the technique (or techniques) used to separate LNPs and PC components is one of the key factors in obtaining realistic results. In particular, LNPs resulted in low-dense soft materials that are hardly separable from the serum nanomaterials, including exosomes and HDL [123,127,128].",

                    "text": "Pharmaceutical and medical applications of nanosystems represent a growing area in the flourishing field of nanotechnology, including developments in advanced pharmaceutical nanocarriers and nanodiagnostics [1][2][3]. Nanosized carriers of very diverse composition are being actively investigated, including metallic, polymeric, ceramic, and lipidic nanoparticles and also hybrid systems by combining such materials [4,5]. \n\nOne of the main limitations of these kinds of delivery systems is their short circulation time due to the opsonization phenomenon and subsequent uptake by the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS). After exposure of nanocarriers to biological fluids, biomolecules are rapidly adsorbed onto their surface forming the protein corona. The corona composition determines the biological identity of the nanoparticle and influences its toxicity, biological fate, circulation time, cell uptake, and drug release kinetics [6,7]. At first, the protein corona includes considerable amounts of low-affinity proteins which abound in the biological medium. Over time, the composition of the corona is enriched with high affinity proteins [7]. Interestingly, some of the adsorbed proteins are opsonins which promote the uptake and degradation of the nanoparticles by the cells of the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS) (mainly located in the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes). Among the proteins commonly found in the corona, IgG and proteins involved in the complement pathway typically act as opsonins (promoting uptake by MPS) whereas serum albumin and apolipoproteins enhance circulation time [8]. The clearance of the nanoparticles by the MPS reduces the bioavailability of the encapsulated drug [9,10]. A considerable amount of evidence, however, indicates that this phenomenon can be reduced by coating the nanoparticles with different polymeric substances [11][12][13]. \n\nLipid-based nanosystems stand out because of their nontoxic, biocompatible and environmentally friendly composition.",

D. Ianni, G. A. Islan, C. Y. Chain, G. R. Castro, A. Talevi, andMar\u00eda E. Vela\n## Abstract\nThe applications of pharmaceutical and medical nanosystems are among the most intensively investigated fields in nanotechnology. A relevant point to be considered in the design and development of nanovehicles intended for medical use is the formation of the \u201cprotein corona\u201d around the nanoparticle, that is, a complex biomolecular layer formed when the nanovehicle is exposed to biological fluids. The chemical nature of the protein corona determines the biological identity of the nanoparticle and influences, among others, the recognition of the nanocarrier by the mononuclear phagocytic system and, thus, its clearance from the blood. Recent works suggest that Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR), extensively employed for the analysis of biomolecular interactions, can shed light on the formation of the protein corona and its interaction with the surroundings. The synthesis and characterization of solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) coated with polymers of different chemical nature (e.g., polyvinyl alcohol, chitosans) are reported. The proof-of-concept for the use of SPR technique in characterizing protein-nanoparticle interactions of surface-immobilized proteins (immunoglobulin G and bovine serum albumin, both involved in the formation of the corona) subjected to flowing SLN is demonstrated for non-chitosan-coated nanoparticles. All assayed nanosystems show more preference for IgG than for BSA, such preference being more pronounced in the case of polyvinyl-alcohol-coated SLN.\n## Introduction\nPharmaceutical and medical applications of nanosystems represent a growing area in the flourishing field of nanotechnology, including developments in advanced pharmaceutical nanocarriers and nanodiagnostics [1][2][3]. Nanosized carriers of very diverse composition are being actively investigated, including metallic, polymeric, ceramic, and lipidic nanoparticles and also hybrid systems by combining such materials [4,5]. \n\nOne of the main limitations of these kinds of delivery systems is their short circulation time due to the opsonization phenomenon and subsequent uptake by the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS). After exposure of nanocarriers to biological fluids, biomolecules are rapidly adsorbed onto their surface forming the protein corona. The corona composition determines the biological identity of the nanoparticle and influences its toxicity, biological fate, circulation time, cell uptake, and drug release kinetics [6,7]. At first, the protein corona includes considerable amounts of low-affinity proteins which abound in the biological medium. Over time, the composition of the corona is enriched with high affinity proteins [7]. Interestingly, some of the adsorbed proteins are opsonins which promote the uptake and degradation of the nanoparticles by the cells of the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS) (mainly located in the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes). Among the proteins commonly found in the corona, IgG and proteins involved in the complement pathway typically act as opsonins (promoting uptake by MPS) whereas serum albumin and apolipoproteins enhance circulation time [8]. The clearance of the nanoparticles by the MPS reduces the bioavailability of the encapsulated drug [9,10]. A considerable amount of evidence, however, indicates that this phenomenon can be reduced by coating the nanoparticles with different polymeric substances [11][12][13]. \n\nLipid-based nanosystems stand out because of their nontoxic, biocompatible and environmentally friendly composition.",

Herein, we developed magnetic iron-oxide-loaded LNPs (IOLNP) that allow separation of LNP\u2013corona complexes from biological media through magnetic separation.

However, targeting specific tissues or cells is still a major challenge. After LNP administration, LNPs interact with biological fluids (i.e., blood), components of which adsorb onto the LNP surface forming a layer of biomolecules termed the \"biomolecular corona (BMC)\" which affects LNP stability, biodistribution, and tissue tropism. The mechanisms by which the BMC influences tissue-and cell-specific targeting remains largely unknown, due to the technical challenges in isolating LNPs and their corona from complex biological media. In this study, we present a new technique that utilizes magnetic LNPs to isolate LNP-corona complexes from unbound proteins present in human serum. First, we developed a magnetic LNP formulation, containing >40 superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs)/LNP, the resulting LNPs containing iron oxide nanoparticles (IOLNPs) displayed a similar particle size and morphology as LNPs loaded with nucleic acids. We further demonstrated the isolation of the IOLNPs and their corresponding BMC from unbound proteins using a magnetic separation (MS) system. The BMC profile of LNP from the MS system was compared to size exclusion column chromatography and further analyzed via mass spectrometry, revealing differences in protein abundances. This new approach enabled a mild and versatile isolation of LNPs and its corona, while maintaining its structural integrity. The identification of the BMC associated with an intact LNP provides further insight into LNP interactions with biological fluids.",

The technological advances carried out in the past three decades have enabled the clinical approval of the first LNP-based siRNA therapeutic, Onpattro (4)(5)(6), which quickly became a landmark formulation that paved the way for the widespread use of LNP as nucleic acid delivery systems (2,7,8) and for the worldwide rollout of the LNP-based vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 (9). However, like many other nanomedicines, LNP suffer from a low selectivity and specificity for target cells and organs and limits clinical translation (10,11). First of all, nanoparticles can be rapidly sequestered by macrophages into the liver and other secondary lymphoid organs, which impair their delivery to target tissues (12). Moreover, while ligand-targeted nanomedicines show a higher efficacy in vitro compared to their untargeted counterpart, this advantage is often lost in vivo due to masking from the formation of a biomolecular protein corona (BMC) (13). The formation of a BMC can be an advantage as several groups have shown that once i.v. administered, the BMC could enable LNPs to possess extrinsic targeting properties, directing them towards specific cell receptors (14-18). An early example of this includes Onpattro, as its ability to interact with specific serum proteins (Apolipoprotein E) after i.v. administrations, directs the LNP towards low-density lipoprotein receptors on the surface of hepatocytes (5,6,19). More recently, studies have focused on extrahepatic delivery by optimizing the physiochemical properties of LNPs to drive distinct BMC profiles, subsequently, enabling targeting of nonliver organs such as the spleen or lungs (20)(21)(22).",

Schiffelers, Dominik Witzigmann, P. Cullis\n## Abstract\nSignificance Lipid nanoparticle (LNP) technology is increasingly enabling many gene therapies. Once LNPs are administered in vivo, preferential LNP targeting to desired cells can be attributed to the formation of a biomolecular corona (BMC), however, characterization of the corona is challenging. This is due to poor separation efficiency of LNP\u2013corona complexes from unbound proteins. Herein, we developed magnetic iron-oxide-loaded LNPs (IOLNP) that allow separation of LNP\u2013corona complexes from biological media through magnetic separation. This technology enables a rapid and selective method to separate LNP\u2013corona complexes and enables in-depth characterization of the BMC while maintaining the particle integrity.\n## body\nLipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulations are a proven method for the delivery of nucleic acids for gene therapy as exemplified by the worldwide rollout of LNP-based RNAi therapeutics and mRNA vaccines. However, targeting specific tissues or cells is still a major challenge. After LNP administration, LNPs interact with biological fluids (i.e., blood), components of which adsorb onto the LNP surface forming a layer of biomolecules termed the \"biomolecular corona (BMC)\" which affects LNP stability, biodistribution, and tissue tropism. The mechanisms by which the BMC influences tissue-and cell-specific targeting remains largely unknown, due to the technical challenges in isolating LNPs and their corona from complex biological media. In this study, we present a new technique that utilizes magnetic LNPs to isolate LNP-corona complexes from unbound proteins present in human serum. First, we developed a magnetic LNP formulation, containing >40 superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs)/LNP, the resulting LNPs containing iron oxide nanoparticles (IOLNPs) displayed a similar particle size and morphology as LNPs loaded with nucleic acids. We further demonstrated the isolation of the IOLNPs and their corresponding BMC from unbound proteins using a magnetic separation (MS) system. The BMC profile of LNP from the MS system was compared to size exclusion column chromatography and further analyzed via mass spectrometry, revealing differences in protein abundances. This new approach enabled a mild and versatile isolation of LNPs and its corona, while maintaining its structural integrity. The identification of the BMC associated with an intact LNP provides further insight into LNP interactions with biological fluids.\n\n## lipid nanoparticles | iron oxide nanoparticles | biomolecular corona | magnetic separation\nLipid nanoparticles (LNP) have emerged as an effective nonviral delivery system for nucleic acid payloads due to their high encapsulation efficiency, low toxicity, ability to facilitate intracellular delivery, and the possibility to modulate their size and surface properties (1)(2)(3). The technological advances carried out in the past three decades have enabled the clinical approval of the first LNP-based siRNA therapeutic, Onpattro (4)(5)(6), which quickly became a landmark formulation that paved the way for the widespread use of LNP as nucleic acid delivery systems (2,7,8) and for the worldwide rollout of the LNP-based vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 (9). However, like many other nanomedicines, LNP suffer from a low selectivity and specificity for target cells and organs and limits clinical translation (10,11). First of all, nanoparticles can be rapidly sequestered by macrophages into the liver and other secondary lymphoid organs, which impair their delivery to target tissues (12). Moreover, while ligand-targeted nanomedicines show a higher efficacy in vitro compared to their untargeted counterpart, this advantage is often lost in vivo due to masking from the formation of a biomolecular protein corona (BMC) (13). The formation of a BMC can be an advantage as several groups have shown that once i.v. administered, the BMC could enable LNPs to possess extrinsic targeting properties, directing them towards specific cell receptors (14-18). An early example of this includes Onpattro, as its ability to interact with specific serum proteins (Apolipoprotein E) after i.v. administrations, directs the LNP towards low-density lipoprotein receptors on the surface of hepatocytes (5,6,19). More recently, studies have focused on extrahepatic delivery by optimizing the physiochemical properties of LNPs to drive distinct BMC profiles, subsequently, enabling targeting of nonliver organs such as the spleen or lungs (20)(21)(22).",

The present work has demonstrated that characterization of the in vivo HC is essential to provide an accurate molecular description of the biological identity of NPs in physiological environments.\n",

Nanoparticles obtained from biopolymers for applications in medicine and pharmaceutics have become particularly popular in recent years due to the enormous research effort in the field of vaccines to respond to the pandemic emergency. Among the various types of biopolymers used to produce nanoparticles for therapeutics, lipids have characteristics that make them biocompatible, with low toxicity and ease of clearance. They can be synthesized by designing their characteristics according to the foreseen administration path, or to the target of the transported drug. The analytical methods mostly used to evaluate the characteristics of lipid nanosytems for drug delivery involve studying their effects on cells, in vitro and in vivo. Although it is often considered a \u201cniche technique\u201c for research in the bio-related sciences, Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) is a versatile tool to study the structure of nanosystems based on lipids, both ex situ and in situ. Therefore, it allows to evaluate both the effect of the different synthesis parameters and of the exposure of lipid nanoparticles to physiological conditions, which is of fundamental importance to design efficient drug delivery systems. In this mini-review, we will report some recent examples of characterization and design of nanoparticles based on lipids, where SAXS has been a fundamental step both to guide the synthesis of nanomaterials with tailored characteristics, and to understand the interaction between nanomaterials and cells.",

The resulting biomolecular corona might interfere with the nanoparticle-cell interaction, induce an immune response and alter the drug-release efficiency [60]. \n\nLiposomes commonly used as vectors for therapeutic molecule delivery can be unilamellar vesicles, where the hydrophilic drug molecules are loaded in the central aqueous core of the nanoparticle, or multilamellar vesicles, which can host lipophilic drugs within the lamellar structure. The majority of liposomes commercially available for drug delivery purposes are Small Unilamellar Vesicles (SUV) [61]-although they are stable during circulation, the interaction of proteins with the SUV surface provokes the formation of multilamellar structures and of liposome clusters: the change in the crystalline structure implies the rupture of the vesicles, which may result in the release of the loaded drug. \n\nThe formation of larger aggregates may impede the cellular uptake of the particles. The latter effect, however, becomes less evident as the concentration of proteins attached to the nanoparticles surface increases, possibly due to the repulsive interaction of charged proteins, as demonstrated by Caracciolo and coworkers [44]. In a recent experiment, they used a commercial formulation of liposomal Doxorubicin, a drug used for cancer treatment, to study the effect of biomolecular corona on nanoparticle stability and drug release, incubating the liposome-drug formulation in the concentration of human plasma that mimics the physiological conditions. TEM, DLS and Zeta potential experiments demonstrated the formation of biomolecular corona already at a low plasma concentration, which led to an increased particle size and to a change in the particle surface charge.",

SAXS characterization of the drug-loaded nanoparticles before and after incubation in human plasma demonstrated the absence of the multilamellar structure, showing that the presence of the biomolecular corona did not lead to the formation of a multilamellar structure; moreover, a fluorescence-lifetime imaging microscopy analysis on the drugloaded liposomes after incubation revealed that the amount of Doxorubicin in the incubated particles was significantly lower with respect to the pristine ones, suggesting that the exposure to human plasma might degrade the liposomes, altering their persistence in the blood circulation. \n\nOn the other hand, protein coating on liposome carriers (namely, protein corona), is effective in protecting the nanoparticles from degradation in blood, reducing the interaction with leukocytes and prolonging the circulation time in vivo. Giulimondi and colleagues recently demonstrated the protective effect against uptake by blood macrophages of preadsorbed human plasma (HP) protein corona on liposomes obtained from cationic, neutral and anionic lipids. SAXS experiments allowed for evaluating the different effects on the mesostructure of increasing concentrations of plasma proteins adsorbed on the surface of liposomes-these observations demonstrated that the nanostructure of liposomes precoated by HP protein corona depends on the surface charge of the uncoated liposomes. Following these results, the authors showed that the protein corona of pre-coated cationic liposomes is not affected by the interaction with human plasma, suggesting that the nanoparticles' ability to evade sequestration by leukocytes during circulation remains stable. The authors demonstrated that at a low concentration, human plasma protein corona prevents the internalization of cationic liposomes into macrophages, but does not have the same effect on neutrally charged or anionic liposomes. Their findings suggest the possibility to use drug-loaded cationic liposomes coated with low-concentration protein corona to prolong blood circulation and facilitate drug delivery to the target sites [40].",

Although it is often considered a \u201cniche technique\u201c for research in the bio-related sciences, Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) is a versatile tool to study the structure of nanosystems based on lipids, both ex situ and in situ. Therefore, it allows to evaluate both the effect of the different synthesis parameters and of the exposure of lipid nanoparticles to physiological conditions, which is of fundamental importance to design efficient drug delivery systems. In this mini-review, we will report some recent examples of characterization and design of nanoparticles based on lipids, where SAXS has been a fundamental step both to guide the synthesis of nanomaterials with tailored characteristics, and to understand the interaction between nanomaterials and cells.\n## Biomolecular Corona\nIn vivo, lipid vectors for drug delivery adsorb proteins, lipids and other plasmatic biomolecules on their surface in a non-specific manner once injected: depending on the nanoparticles' properties, such as their charge, hydrophilicity, dimensions and morphology, the several components present in plasma interact and build a coating. The resulting biomolecular corona might interfere with the nanoparticle-cell interaction, induce an immune response and alter the drug-release efficiency [60]. \n\nLiposomes commonly used as vectors for therapeutic molecule delivery can be unilamellar vesicles, where the hydrophilic drug molecules are loaded in the central aqueous core of the nanoparticle, or multilamellar vesicles, which can host lipophilic drugs within the lamellar structure. The majority of liposomes commercially available for drug delivery purposes are Small Unilamellar Vesicles (SUV) [61]-although they are stable during circulation, the interaction of proteins with the SUV surface provokes the formation of multilamellar structures and of liposome clusters: the change in the crystalline structure implies the rupture of the vesicles, which may result in the release of the loaded drug. \n\nThe formation of larger aggregates may impede the cellular uptake of the particles. The latter effect, however, becomes less evident as the concentration of proteins attached to the nanoparticles surface increases, possibly due to the repulsive interaction of charged proteins, as demonstrated by Caracciolo and coworkers [44]. In a recent experiment, they used a commercial formulation of liposomal Doxorubicin, a drug used for cancer treatment, to study the effect of biomolecular corona on nanoparticle stability and drug release, incubating the liposome-drug formulation in the concentration of human plasma that mimics the physiological conditions. TEM, DLS and Zeta potential experiments demonstrated the formation of biomolecular corona already at a low plasma concentration, which led to an increased particle size and to a change in the particle surface charge.\n...\nTEM, DLS and Zeta potential experiments demonstrated the formation of biomolecular corona already at a low plasma concentration, which led to an increased particle size and to a change in the particle surface charge. SAXS characterization of the drug-loaded nanoparticles before and after incubation in human plasma demonstrated the absence of the multilamellar structure, showing that the presence of the biomolecular corona did not lead to the formation of a multilamellar structure; moreover, a fluorescence-lifetime imaging microscopy analysis on the drugloaded liposomes after incubation revealed that the amount of Doxorubicin in the incubated particles was significantly lower with respect to the pristine ones, suggesting that the exposure to human plasma might degrade the liposomes, altering their persistence in the blood circulation. \n\nOn the other hand, protein coating on liposome carriers (namely, protein corona), is effective in protecting the nanoparticles from degradation in blood, reducing the interaction with leukocytes and prolonging the circulation time in vivo. Giulimondi and colleagues recently demonstrated the protective effect against uptake by blood macrophages of preadsorbed human plasma (HP) protein corona on liposomes obtained from cationic, neutral and anionic lipids. SAXS experiments allowed for evaluating the different effects on the mesostructure of increasing concentrations of plasma proteins adsorbed on the surface of liposomes-these observations demonstrated that the nanostructure of liposomes precoated by HP protein corona depends on the surface charge of the uncoated liposomes. Following these results, the authors showed that the protein corona of pre-coated cationic liposomes is not affected by the interaction with human plasma, suggesting that the nanoparticles' ability to evade sequestration by leukocytes during circulation remains stable. The authors demonstrated that at a low concentration, human plasma protein corona prevents the internalization of cationic liposomes into macrophages, but does not have the same effect on neutrally charged or anionic liposomes. Their findings suggest the possibility to use drug-loaded cationic liposomes coated with low-concentration protein corona to prolong blood circulation and facilitate drug delivery to the target sites [40].",

Stravalaci, F. Re, D. Moscatelli, P. Bigini, M. Salmona, M. Gobbi\n## Abstract\nGreat interest is currently being devoted to the development of nanoparticles (NPs) for biomedical purposes, designed to improve the pharmacokinetic profile of their cargos (either imaging probes or drugs) and to enhance the specific targeting at the disease site. Recent works suggest that Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR), widely used for the analysis of biomolecular interactions, represents a technique of choice for rapid and quantitative analyses of the interaction between NPs\u2014functionalized with specific ligands\u2014and their putative biological targets. Moreover, SPR can provide important details on the formation and the role of the protein \u201ccorona\u201d, i.e., the protein layer which coats NPs once they come into contact with biological fluids. These novel applications of SPR sensors may be very useful to characterize, screen and develop nanodevices for biomedical purposes.\n## SPR for Investigating Protein Corona\nWhen NPs enter biological fluids, e.g., the blood after systemic administration or the cytosol after cell uptake, they are coated by biomolecules, in particular proteins, which adsorb onto their surface [7,8].The new layer, or corona, confers to NPs properties which might be very different from those of the bare NPs, markedly affecting their behaviour with regards to pharmacokinetics (biodistribution, interaction with immune system and clearance) and pharmacodynamics (interaction with cells and putative biological targets) [6,7].\n\nThe formation and composition of protein corona is a complex process depending on the physicochemical properties of NPs (e.g., size, composition and charge) [5,30,[35][36][37] and on the biological fluid (protein's abundance and affinity for NPs surface) [7,35,38].The protein adsorption is also a dynamic and competitive process, where more abundant proteins might adsorb at first, even with weak bonds, being displaced thereafter by less abundant proteins with higher affinity for the NPs surface [30,39,40].For example, experimental data [41] and the results of a simulation model [40] suggest that human serum albumin (HSA) forms the early corona, and is soon replaced by higher-affinity and slower-exchanging apolipoproteins.The labile corona formed at initial time points is usually indicated as the \"soft corona\" and is characterized by a fast exchange rate with free proteins all around, whereas the latter is indicated as \"hard corona\" and is due to a more stable layer of proteins.Proteins adsorbed after incubation of NPs in plasma can be identified by proteomic analysis, and previous studies [5,8,36] indicated that the hard corona is mainly composed by 10-50 proteins including HSA, specific lipoproteins and proteins involved in coagulation and the complement pathway, with different consequences relevant to nanomedicine and nanosafety.",

However, when nanoparticles flow through the bloodstream, they interact with various plasma proteins, leading to the formation of protein layers on the nanoparticle surface, called protein corona. Experiments have shown that protein corona modulates nanoparticle size, shape, and surface properties and, thus, influence the aggregation of nanoparticles and their interactions with cell membranes, which can increases or decreases the delivery efficiency. To complement these experimental findings and understand atomic-level phenomena that cannot be captured by experiments, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been performed for the past decade. Here, we aim to review the critical role of MD simulations to understand (1) the conformation, binding site, and strength of plasma proteins that are adsorbed onto nanoparticle surfaces, (2) the competitive adsorption and desorption of plasma proteins on nanoparticle surfaces, and (3) the interactions between protein-coated nanoparticles and cell membranes. MD simulations have successfully predicted the competitive binding and conformation of protein corona and its effect on the nanoparticle\u2013nanoparticle and nanoparticle\u2013membrane interactions. In particular, simulations have uncovered the mechanism regarding the competitive adsorption and desorption of plasma proteins, which helps to explain the Vroman effect. Overall, these findings indicate that simulations can now provide predications in excellent agreement with experimental observations as well as atomic-scale insights into protein corona formation and interactions.",

However, when nanoparticles flow through the bloodstream, they interact with various plasma proteins, leading to the formation of protein layers on the nanoparticle surface, called protein corona. Experiments have shown that protein corona modulates nanoparticle size, shape, and surface properties and, thus, influence the aggregation of nanoparticles and their interactions with cell membranes, which can increases or decreases the delivery efficiency. To complement these experimental findings and understand atomic-level phenomena that cannot be captured by experiments, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been performed for the past decade. Here, we aim to review the critical role of MD simulations to understand (1) the conformation, binding site, and strength of plasma proteins that are adsorbed onto nanoparticle surfaces, (2) the competitive adsorption and desorption of plasma proteins on nanoparticle surfaces, and (3) the interactions between protein-coated nanoparticles and cell membranes. MD simulations have successfully predicted the competitive binding and conformation of protein corona and its effect on the nanoparticle\u2013nanoparticle and nanoparticle\u2013membrane interactions. In particular, simulations have uncovered the mechanism regarding the competitive adsorption and desorption of plasma proteins, which helps to explain the Vroman effect. Overall, these findings indicate that simulations can now provide predications in excellent agreement with experimental observations as well as atomic-scale insights into protein corona formation and interactions.\n## Conclusions\nThe experimental and theoretical studies have revealed that protein corona influences conformations and surface properties of nanoparticles and their interactions with cell membranes, although those mechanisms have not been well understood at the atomic scale. As computer power and force-field development have advanced, MD simulations have provided considerable useful information regarding the formation of protein corona and its effect on nanoparticle properties and the nanoparticle-membrane binding for the past decade. In particular, MD simulations have been able to explore the competitive adsorption and desorption of plasma proteins on differently sized and charged nanoparticles, which helps to explain the experimental results and the Vroman effect. \n\nAlthough MD simulations have captured the experimental observations of corona formation and its interactions with nanoparticles and membranes, there are still differences in environments and mass transport conditions of experiments and simulations, which precludes any quantitative comparison between the two. For instance, there are hundreds of plasma proteins that compete with each other and form protein corona on nanoparticle surfaces. Additionally, the flowing velocity of bloodstream may modulate protein-protein and protein-nanoparticle interactions. Cell membranes consist of various membrane proteins and lipids, and their components and ratios vary in different cells. Filaments of cytoskeleton influence the membrane shape and mechanical resistance and, thus, may modulate the protein-membrane interaction. These details should be considered to predict the adsorption kinetics and final composition of protein corona for drug delivery applications, which are expected to be resolved in the future by recent efforts in developing multiscale-simulation methodologies and realistic cell-membrane models.

This corona comprises proteins that strongly bind to the NP (hard corona) and loosely bound proteins (soft corona) that dynamically exchange with the surrounding solution. While the kinetics of hard corona formation is relatively well understood, thanks to experiments and robust simulation models, the experimental characterization and simulation of the soft corona present a more significant challenge. Here, we review the current state of the art in soft corona characterization and introduce a novel open-source computational model to simulate its dynamic behavior, for which we provide the documentation. We focus on the case of transferrin (Tf) interacting with polystyrene NPs as an illustrative example, demonstrating how this model captures the complexities of the soft corona and offers deeper insights into its structure and behavior. We show that the soft corona is dominated by a glassy evolution that we relate to crowding effects. This work advances our understanding of the soft corona, bridging experimental limitations with improved simulation techniques.",

Biological media, such as blood plasma, are incredibly complex and contain over 3,700 identified proteins, leading to a highly competitive environment for the formation of the corona. This phenomenon, known as the Vroman effect, highlights the dynamic nature of protein adsorption, where proteins with higher mobility and lower affinity initially occupy the NP surface, only to be replaced by proteins with higher affinity over time. \n\nIn addition to proteins, several other molecules in whole blood can contribute to the formation of the NP corona [36], including lipids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, metabolites, complement factors, and antibodies [62]. For example, lipids such as cholesterol and phospholipids, glycans-which are carbohydrate molecules that play a role in cell recognition and signaling-or small metabolites like glucose, hormones, and vitamins can adsorb onto NPs, altering their surface properties and influencing their interactions with cells [61]. \n\nOn the other hand, circulating DNA is present in the blood of all individuals [67], and its concentration increases in cancer patients [28]. Furthermore, depending on the state of different diseases, blood plasma also contains a variety of RNA types, including mRNAs, noncoding RNAs, and fragments of rRNAs, snoRNAs, and miRNAs [54,58], suggesting that the NP-corona composition also depends on the health condition of the host. Moreover, complement factors that are part of the immune system and immunoglobulins or antibodies, which are glycoproteins produced by plasma cells, can mark the NP for clearance by immune cells [61]. Therefore, it will be critical in the future to understand how all these components collectively form the biomolecular hard and soft corona, which significantly impacts the biological identity and fate of NPs in the body [62].",

Vilanova, Alberto Martinez-Serra, M. Monopoli, Giancarlo Franzese\n## Abstract\nNanoparticles (NPs) in contact with biological fluid adsorb biomolecules into a corona. This corona comprises proteins that strongly bind to the NP (hard corona) and loosely bound proteins (soft corona) that dynamically exchange with the surrounding solution. While the kinetics of hard corona formation is relatively well understood, thanks to experiments and robust simulation models, the experimental characterization and simulation of the soft corona present a more significant challenge. Here, we review the current state of the art in soft corona characterization and introduce a novel open-source computational model to simulate its dynamic behavior, for which we provide the documentation. We focus on the case of transferrin (Tf) interacting with polystyrene NPs as an illustrative example, demonstrating how this model captures the complexities of the soft corona and offers deeper insights into its structure and behavior. We show that the soft corona is dominated by a glassy evolution that we relate to crowding effects. This work advances our understanding of the soft corona, bridging experimental limitations with improved simulation techniques.\n## DISCUSSION, CONCLUSIONS, AND PERSPECTIVES\nFor this reason, to benefit the scientific community, we provide an open-source interactive tutorial with all the steps required to perform the simulations, defining and implementing a buffer of molecules capable of controlling the concentration of proteins in the vicinity of the NP [69]. \n\nFuture research in this field of NP-corona interactions with biological systems should expand beyond the limited scope of studying the competition among just a few types of proteins. Biological media, such as blood plasma, are incredibly complex and contain over 3,700 identified proteins, leading to a highly competitive environment for the formation of the corona. This phenomenon, known as the Vroman effect, highlights the dynamic nature of protein adsorption, where proteins with higher mobility and lower affinity initially occupy the NP surface, only to be replaced by proteins with higher affinity over time. \n\nIn addition to proteins, several other molecules in whole blood can contribute to the formation of the NP corona [36], including lipids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, metabolites, complement factors, and antibodies [62]. For example, lipids such as cholesterol and phospholipids, glycans-which are carbohydrate molecules that play a role in cell recognition and signaling-or small metabolites like glucose, hormones, and vitamins can adsorb onto NPs, altering their surface properties and influencing their interactions with cells [61]. \n\nOn the other hand, circulating DNA is present in the blood of all individuals [67], and its concentration increases in cancer patients [28]. Furthermore, depending on the state of different diseases, blood plasma also contains a variety of RNA types, including mRNAs, noncoding RNAs, and fragments of rRNAs, snoRNAs, and miRNAs [54,58], suggesting that the NP-corona composition also depends on the health condition of the host. Moreover, complement factors that are part of the immune system and immunoglobulins or antibodies, which are glycoproteins produced by plasma cells, can mark the NP for clearance by immune cells [61]. Therefore, it will be critical in the future to understand how all these components collectively form the biomolecular hard and soft corona, which significantly impacts the biological identity and fate of NPs in the body [62].",

Moreover, the roles of different formulations in differential biological distribution, as well as the general relationship between lipid structure, formulation, and activity, are areas that require further exploration. 122 iScience Review Figure 6. Representative chemical structures of key lipids designed for organ-selective nucleic acids delivery Proteins from plasma are adsorbed onto the LNPs surface to form a protein corona in the blood circulation. The protein corona formed on LNPs after intravenous injection contains hundreds of biomolecules (mainly proteins and lipids). LNPs are cleared and extravasated from the circulation, and ultimately function intracellularly via cellular uptake and undergo organ, cellular, and molecular biological processes. 138 The composition of the protein corona is influenced by the chemical and molecular components of the surface of the LNPs, as well as its charge. This formation of protein coronas allows the fate of LNPs in vivo to be predicted, and even the targeting ligands can be shielded so that LNPs can be delivered less efficiently. Thus, understanding protein corona can help in the design of novel targeted LNPs. 20 sually, the formation of protein corona reduces the delivery efficiency of LNPs, and encapsulation of LNPs on the surface with PEG or other materials usually inhibits the formation of protein corona and prolongs the blood circulation of LNPs. 139 Recent studies have shown that apolipoproteins can be incorporated into protein corona, exerting endogenous targeting properties and playing an important role in organ-and cell-specific targeting of LNPs. 140",

Moreover, the roles of different formulations in differential biological distribution, as well as the general relationship between lipid structure, formulation, and activity, are areas that require further exploration. 122 iScience Review Figure 6. Representative chemical structures of key lipids designed for organ-selective nucleic acids delivery Proteins from plasma are adsorbed onto the LNPs surface to form a protein corona in the blood circulation. The protein corona formed on LNPs after intravenous injection contains hundreds of biomolecules (mainly proteins and lipids). LNPs are cleared and extravasated from the circulation, and ultimately function intracellularly via cellular uptake and undergo organ, cellular, and molecular biological processes. 138 The composition of the protein corona is influenced by the chemical and molecular components of the surface of the LNPs, as well as its charge. This formation of protein coronas allows the fate of LNPs in vivo to be predicted, and even the targeting ligands can be shielded so that LNPs can be delivered less efficiently. Thus, understanding protein corona can help in the design of novel targeted LNPs. 20 sually, the formation of protein corona reduces the delivery efficiency of LNPs, and encapsulation of LNPs on the surface with PEG or other materials usually inhibits the formation of protein corona and prolongs the blood circulation of LNPs. 139 Recent studies have shown that apolipoproteins can be incorporated into protein corona, exerting endogenous targeting properties and playing an important role in organ-and cell-specific targeting of LNPs. 140",

The scope of LNP applications in terms of RNA is not limited to antiviral vaccines but encompasses anticancer drugs and therapeutics for genetic (including rare) diseases. Such widespread use implies high customizability of targeted delivery of LNPs to specific organs and tissues. This review addresses vector-free options for targeted delivery of LNPs, namely the influence of lipid composition of these nanoparticles on their biodistribution. In the review, experimental studies are examined that are focused on the biodistribution of mRNA or of the encoded protein after mRNA administration via LNPs in mammals. We also performed a comprehensive analysis of individual lipids\u2019 functional groups that ensure biodistribution to desired organs. These data will allow us to outline prospects for further optimization of lipid compositions of nanoparticles for targeted delivery of mRNA therapeutics.",

The addition of an anionic lipid reduced pK a , whereas the addition of a cationic lipid increased pK a , which affected the interaction with plasma proteins and the formation of the protein corona (Dilliard et al., 2021). Results of their proteomic analysis of the protein corona suggested that targeting to the liver takes place with predominance of the ApoE protein in the protein corona; to lungs, with predominance of the \u03b22-GPI protein; and to the spleen, with predominance of the VTN protein. Incubation of these proteins with the LNPs in vitro also enabled specific LNP targeting (Dilliard et al., 2021). \n\nThose authors proposed a three-stage mechanism underlying the targeting of a five-component LNP (Dilliard et al., 2021). The first stage is the dissociation of the PEGylated lipid from the surface of LNPs; the second is the binding of SORT-lipid to blood proteins; and the third stage is the binding of proteins (adhering to the  Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org 09 particle) to tissue-specific receptors. In the case of PEG with a longer aliphatic anchor, which shows worse desorption, the expression of the reporter protein in all organs was noticeably lower, thus confirming the above mechanism. In another study (Meyer et al., 2022), LNPs containing a positively charged group of the additional lipid and a PLGA polymer also got distributed into lungs and the spleen, and the distribution was influenced by the ratio of a cationic lipid (DOTAP) to an ionizable lipid (MC3).",

Ivanov, V. Reshetnikov\n## Abstract\nToday, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are some of the main delivery systems for mRNA-based therapeutics. The scope of LNP applications in terms of RNA is not limited to antiviral vaccines but encompasses anticancer drugs and therapeutics for genetic (including rare) diseases. Such widespread use implies high customizability of targeted delivery of LNPs to specific organs and tissues. This review addresses vector-free options for targeted delivery of LNPs, namely the influence of lipid composition of these nanoparticles on their biodistribution. In the review, experimental studies are examined that are focused on the biodistribution of mRNA or of the encoded protein after mRNA administration via LNPs in mammals. We also performed a comprehensive analysis of individual lipids\u2019 functional groups that ensure biodistribution to desired organs. These data will allow us to outline prospects for further optimization of lipid compositions of nanoparticles for targeted delivery of mRNA therapeutics.\n## Helper lipids\nFor classic fourcomponent LNPs, apparent pK a was 6.3-6.6 in the above study, depending on the ionizable cationic lipid used. The addition of an anionic lipid reduced pK a , whereas the addition of a cationic lipid increased pK a , which affected the interaction with plasma proteins and the formation of the protein corona (Dilliard et al., 2021). Results of their proteomic analysis of the protein corona suggested that targeting to the liver takes place with predominance of the ApoE protein in the protein corona; to lungs, with predominance of the \u03b22-GPI protein; and to the spleen, with predominance of the VTN protein. Incubation of these proteins with the LNPs in vitro also enabled specific LNP targeting (Dilliard et al., 2021). \n\nThose authors proposed a three-stage mechanism underlying the targeting of a five-component LNP (Dilliard et al., 2021). The first stage is the dissociation of the PEGylated lipid from the surface of LNPs; the second is the binding of SORT-lipid to blood proteins; and the third stage is the binding of proteins (adhering to the  Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org 09 particle) to tissue-specific receptors. In the case of PEG with a longer aliphatic anchor, which shows worse desorption, the expression of the reporter protein in all organs was noticeably lower, thus confirming the above mechanism. In another study (Meyer et al., 2022), LNPs containing a positively charged group of the additional lipid and a PLGA polymer also got distributed into lungs and the spleen, and the distribution was influenced by the ratio of a cationic lipid (DOTAP) to an ionizable lipid (MC3).",

The mechanisms of protein adsorption and the impact of the protein corona composition on interactions with the innate immune system have been reviewed in depth (Caracciolo, 2015;Barbero et al., 2017). The protein corona contributes to particle opsonization and phagocytic clearance, and may also lead to formation of immune complexes, immunogenic epitope generation from self-antigens, and activation or suppression of immune responses (Caracciolo, 2015;Corbo et al., 2016;Barbero et al., 2017). Moreover, the protein corona can interfere with targeting functions of liposomes surface-conjugated to active targeting molecules such as antibodies (Nellis et al., 2005;Suzuki et al., 2008). Recent work in understanding the protein corona has shown that its composition is dynamic and highly variable, depending on the physicochemical characteristics of the nanoparticle as well as fluctuations in host circulating proteins. This may especially be relevant for cancer nanomedicines due to profound and heterogenous immune dysfunction associated with different types of cancer (Rosenberg, 2001). A major implication of this is that in vitro studies and studies in \"healthy\" animals are not sufficient to fully characterize the protein corona and biological impact of liposomal drugs intended for treatment of cancer. \n\nLiposome interactions with circulating complement proteins can also lead to activation of the complement cascade (Alving, 1992;Verma et al., 1992;Szebeni et al., 2002;Dobrovolskaia et al., 2008), generating complement cleavage products that are opsonins (e.g., C3b) and fragments that are anaphylatoxins (e.g., C5a). The latter have been associated with development of acute infusion reactions in patients known as complement activationrelated pseudoallergy (CARPA) (Chanan-Khan et al., 2003).",

M. La\u2010Beck, Xinli Liu, L. Wood\n## Abstract\nLiposomal nanoparticles are a heterogeneous group of engineered drug carriers that have tremendous therapeutic potential in the treatment of cancer. They increase tumor drug delivery, significantly attenuate drug toxicity, and protect the drug from degradation. However, two decades after approval of the first nanoparticle-mediated anticancer drug, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil), there has yet to be a major shift in cancer treatment paradigms. Only two anticancer nanoparticles are used in the first-line treatment of cancer patients, with all others relegated to the refractory or salvage setting. Herein, we discuss new insights into the mechanisms underlying in vivo interactions between liposomes and the tumor immunologic milieu, and the knowledge gaps that need to be addressed in order to realize the full clinical potential of cancer nanomedicines. We also discuss immunopharmacology insights from a parallel field, Cancer Immunotherapy, which have the potential to generate breakthroughs in Cancer Nanomedicine.\n## INTERACTIONS WITH CIRCULATING PROTEINS\nCirculating proteins rapidly adsorb to the surface of liposomes, forming a protein corona that is the interface for biological interactions (Caracciolo, 2015;Corbo et al., 2016). The mechanisms of protein adsorption and the impact of the protein corona composition on interactions with the innate immune system have been reviewed in depth (Caracciolo, 2015;Barbero et al., 2017). The protein corona contributes to particle opsonization and phagocytic clearance, and may also lead to formation of immune complexes, immunogenic epitope generation from self-antigens, and activation or suppression of immune responses (Caracciolo, 2015;Corbo et al., 2016;Barbero et al., 2017). Moreover, the protein corona can interfere with targeting functions of liposomes surface-conjugated to active targeting molecules such as antibodies (Nellis et al., 2005;Suzuki et al., 2008). Recent work in understanding the protein corona has shown that its composition is dynamic and highly variable, depending on the physicochemical characteristics of the nanoparticle as well as fluctuations in host circulating proteins. This may especially be relevant for cancer nanomedicines due to profound and heterogenous immune dysfunction associated with different types of cancer (Rosenberg, 2001). A major implication of this is that in vitro studies and studies in \"healthy\" animals are not sufficient to fully characterize the protein corona and biological impact of liposomal drugs intended for treatment of cancer. \n\nLiposome interactions with circulating complement proteins can also lead to activation of the complement cascade (Alving, 1992;Verma et al., 1992;Szebeni et al., 2002;Dobrovolskaia et al., 2008), generating complement cleavage products that are opsonins (e.g., C3b) and fragments that are anaphylatoxins (e.g., C5a). The latter have been associated with development of acute infusion reactions in patients known as complement activationrelated pseudoallergy (CARPA) (Chanan-Khan et al., 2003).",

Yet, the ability of LNPs to effectively encapsulate large-size DNA molecules remains elusive. This is a significant limitation, as the successful delivery of large-size DNA holds immense potential for gene therapy. To address this gap, the present study focuses on the design of PEGylated LNPs, incorporating large-sized DNA, departing from traditional RNA and ionizable lipids. The resultant LNPs demonstrate a unique particle morphology. These particles were further engineered with a DNA coating and plasma proteins. This multicomponent bionanoconstruct exhibits enhanced transfection efficiency and safety in controlled laboratory settings and improved immune system evasion in in vivo tests. These findings provide valuable insights for the design and development of bionanoarchitectures for large-size DNA delivery, opening new avenues for transformative gene therapies.",

                    "text": "The stability of an artificial protein corona in a protein-rich environment (such as the bloodstream and the cytoplasm) is a key requirement for its effectiveness. This is because the corona stability influences its ability to maintain its composition and structure over time 1,2 . In a protein-rich environment, various proteins are present that can potentially interact with the corona. If the corona is not stable, it may undergo structural changes or disintegrate, leading to alterations in its composition. This can have significant implications for the corona's functionality, including its ability to influence interactions between the NP and biological systems. As an example, Qin et al. 3 demonstrated that an intracellular protein corona (IPC) can form on nanoparticles once they are taken up by cells. This IPC has the potential to significantly impact the intracellular transport network of these NPs. A stable protein corona is therefore crucial for maintaining the specific interactions and properties that were designed or intended. It helps ensure that the corona continues to serve its intended purpose, whether it is to enhance biocompatibility, modulate cellular uptake by engaging specific receptors, or influence other aspects of nanoparticle behavior. \n\nFor this purpose, we prepared coronated LNP and LNPi at different plasma percentages. Each batch was aliquoted into two portions. The first represents the formulation as synthesized in the laboratory, constituting the system ready for in vivo applications. This batch was kept as is for 1 hour at 37 \u00b0C. Simultaneously, the second batch was exposed to 50% HP, i.e., the percentage of plasma commonly used in literature to mimic the injection of NPs into the circulatory system. Finally, we employed SDS-PAGE to compare the corona composition of coronated LNP and LNPi before and after plasma exposure (the electrophoretic gel is shown in Supplementary Figure 6a). First, we observe that the electrophoretic profiles of coronated LNP (light gray) change as a function of protein concentration. This first observation is in line with previous results obtained with lipid gene vectors 4 , and other NP types 5 . After exposure to 50% high protein concentration (depicted in dark grey), LNP displayed very similar protein profiles.",

Caracciolo\n## Abstract\nLipid nanoparticles (LNPs) play a crucial role in addressing genetic disorders, and cancer, and combating pandemics such as COVID-19 and its variants. Yet, the ability of LNPs to effectively encapsulate large-size DNA molecules remains elusive. This is a significant limitation, as the successful delivery of large-size DNA holds immense potential for gene therapy. To address this gap, the present study focuses on the design of PEGylated LNPs, incorporating large-sized DNA, departing from traditional RNA and ionizable lipids. The resultant LNPs demonstrate a unique particle morphology. These particles were further engineered with a DNA coating and plasma proteins. This multicomponent bionanoconstruct exhibits enhanced transfection efficiency and safety in controlled laboratory settings and improved immune system evasion in in vivo tests. These findings provide valuable insights for the design and development of bionanoarchitectures for large-size DNA delivery, opening new avenues for transformative gene therapies.\n## Protein Corona Stability in Excess Protein Conditions.\nThe stability of an artificial protein corona in a protein-rich environment (such as the bloodstream and the cytoplasm) is a key requirement for its effectiveness. This is because the corona stability influences its ability to maintain its composition and structure over time 1,2 . In a protein-rich environment, various proteins are present that can potentially interact with the corona. If the corona is not stable, it may undergo structural changes or disintegrate, leading to alterations in its composition. This can have significant implications for the corona's functionality, including its ability to influence interactions between the NP and biological systems. As an example, Qin et al. 3 demonstrated that an intracellular protein corona (IPC) can form on nanoparticles once they are taken up by cells. This IPC has the potential to significantly impact the intracellular transport network of these NPs. A stable protein corona is therefore crucial for maintaining the specific interactions and properties that were designed or intended. It helps ensure that the corona continues to serve its intended purpose, whether it is to enhance biocompatibility, modulate cellular uptake by engaging specific receptors, or influence other aspects of nanoparticle behavior. \n\nFor this purpose, we prepared coronated LNP and LNPi at different plasma percentages. Each batch was aliquoted into two portions. The first represents the formulation as synthesized in the laboratory, constituting the system ready for in vivo applications. This batch was kept as is for 1 hour at 37 \u00b0C. Simultaneously, the second batch was exposed to 50% HP, i.e., the percentage of plasma commonly used in literature to mimic the injection of NPs into the circulatory system. Finally, we employed SDS-PAGE to compare the corona composition of coronated LNP and LNPi before and after plasma exposure (the electrophoretic gel is shown in Supplementary Figure 6a). First, we observe that the electrophoretic profiles of coronated LNP (light gray) change as a function of protein concentration. This first observation is in line with previous results obtained with lipid gene vectors 4 , and other NP types 5 . After exposure to 50% high protein concentration (depicted in dark grey), LNP displayed very similar protein profiles.",

Because proteins have different sorption efficacy, isolating particles with a full corona and characterizing the full corona is challenging. In this study, we propose a photo-activated cross-linker for full protein corona fixation.

We believe that the shape of the corona on the MLNC is due to the uneven surface properties of the lipid-peptide envelope of this nanoconstruct, as well as the high diversity of proteins in the serum. \n\nEvidence in favor of this assumption comes from recent publications on corona studies on extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are naturally occurring lipid-enveloped NPs and play important roles in many physiological processes. The uneven distribution of transmembrane proteins in the EV membrane, shown by super-resolution fluorescence microscopy, may determine the uneven binding of environmental proteins to the membrane, followed by \"uneven\" corona on the surface of the vesicles described [26]. \n\nThe formation of a corona consisting of large protein aggregates randomly sorbed on the surface of EVs was demonstrated using confocal microscopy [27]. The belonging of these aggregates to the protein corona was confirmed by immunoelectron microscopy and changes in membrane structure of naked and coronated EVs on ultrathin sections. These results reflect the complexity of the interaction of the lipid membranes of natural EVs with environmental proteins and are not surprising. We think that the structure of the corona observed on MLNC is consistent with the corona variants described in [27]. \n\nOn the surface of MLNCs bearing a corona, spherical electron-dense particles (20-50 nm) are sometimes found (Figure 14H). In the center of the particles, a \"light\" core, surrounded by an uneven layer of high electron density, can be recognized. The structure and size of these particles make it possible to identify them as lipoproteins (non-vesicles) present in serum and other biological fluids [28,29]. \n\nThe appearance of a full corona on the surface of the MLNCs after UV irradiation allows us to conclude that it was the fixation of the components of the soft corona to the hard (\"invisible\" in TEM) that made it possible to obtain a visible, complete corona.",

Epanchintseva, Julia E. Poletaeva, Irina A Bakhno, Vladimir V. Belov, A. Grigor\u2019eva, S. V. Baranova, E. Ryabchikova, Ilya S. Dovydenko\n## Abstract\nSpontaneous sorption of proteins on the nanoparticles\u2019 surface leads to the fact that nanoparticles in biological media are always enveloped by a layer of proteins\u2014the protein corona. Corona proteins affect the properties of nanoparticles and their behavior in a biological environment. In this regard, knowledge about the composition of the corona is a necessary element for the development of nanomedicine. Because proteins have different sorption efficacy, isolating particles with a full corona and characterizing the full corona is challenging. In this study, we propose a photo-activated cross-linker for full protein corona fixation. We believe that the application of our proposed approach will make it possible to capture and visualize the full corona on nanoparticles coated with a lipid shell.\n## Detection of Full Corona Formation\nThe corona formed on MLNCs is not similar to the coronas in the form of a uniform cloud around metal and polymer NPs presented in a number of publications [10,[23][24][25]. We believe that the shape of the corona on the MLNC is due to the uneven surface properties of the lipid-peptide envelope of this nanoconstruct, as well as the high diversity of proteins in the serum. \n\nEvidence in favor of this assumption comes from recent publications on corona studies on extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are naturally occurring lipid-enveloped NPs and play important roles in many physiological processes. The uneven distribution of transmembrane proteins in the EV membrane, shown by super-resolution fluorescence microscopy, may determine the uneven binding of environmental proteins to the membrane, followed by \"uneven\" corona on the surface of the vesicles described [26]. \n\nThe formation of a corona consisting of large protein aggregates randomly sorbed on the surface of EVs was demonstrated using confocal microscopy [27]. The belonging of these aggregates to the protein corona was confirmed by immunoelectron microscopy and changes in membrane structure of naked and coronated EVs on ultrathin sections. These results reflect the complexity of the interaction of the lipid membranes of natural EVs with environmental proteins and are not surprising. We think that the structure of the corona observed on MLNC is consistent with the corona variants described in [27]. \n\nOn the surface of MLNCs bearing a corona, spherical electron-dense particles (20-50 nm) are sometimes found (Figure 14H). In the center of the particles, a \"light\" core, surrounded by an uneven layer of high electron density, can be recognized. The structure and size of these particles make it possible to identify them as lipoproteins (non-vesicles) present in serum and other biological fluids [28,29]. \n\nThe appearance of a full corona on the surface of the MLNCs after UV irradiation allows us to conclude that it was the fixation of the components of the soft corona to the hard (\"invisible\" in TEM) that made it possible to obtain a visible, complete corona.",

The considerable number of currently ongoing clinical studies are testament to this fact. These efforts towards the development of LNPs warrant an insight into the fundamental developmental aspects of such systems. In this review, we discuss the key design aspects that confer efficacy to a LNP delivery system, i.e., potency, biodegradability, and immunogenicity. We also cover the underlying considerations regarding the route of administration and targeting of LNPs to hepatic and non-hepatic targets. Furthermore, since LNP efficacy is also a function of drug/nucleic acid release within endosomes, we take a holistic view of charged-based targeting approaches of LNPs not only in the context of endosomal escape but also in relation to other comparable target cell internalization strategies. Electrostatic charge-based interactions have been used in the past as a potential strategy to enhance the drug release from pH-sensitive liposomes. In this review, we cover such strategies around endosomal escape and cell internalization in low pH tumor micro-environments.",

                    "text": "The PEG shedding strategy used in recently developed LNP systems is based on PEG lipid desorption from the LNP surface upon entering systemic circulation. The PEG coating on one hand prevents the aggregation of liposomes upon storage and to some extent in vivo also, but on the other hand hinders interactions of lipid nanoparticles with target cell membranes and their subsequent internalization [50,51]. Ideally, the PEG layer should be removed at the site of action. \n\nThe way the PEG coating is exploited for targeting/stability has varied over the years by either making it a more stable component of LNP systems to evade undesired immune responses while in systemic circulation, as in the case of intravenously administered LNPs, or by applying the PEG coating as a transient component which provides stability upon storage but sheds in vivo upon interaction with serum proteins, as is the case for intramuscularly administered LNPs. The shedding of PEG relies on (i) shorter carbon chain lengths of the lipid that is conjugated to the PEG, (ii) the concentration of serum proteins in vivo, and (iii) the time of exposure to serum proteins [52]. In an in vitro study, Gallud et al. [52] demonstrated an increase in the uptake of PEGylated LNPs in Huh 7 cells when LNPs were pre-incubated in fetal bovine serum (FBS). Moreover, the increase in LNP uptake was proportional to the amount of FBS present and the time of incubation. They also showed that LNPs anchored to streptavidin via Biotin-mediated binding were released as the medium was exposed to FBS, providing a clear insight into the FBS-mediated release of PEG lipids. However, the precise mechanism of stimulation by serum proteins to augment the PEG lipid release from the LNPs is still unknown. \n\nAdditionally, there are other mechanisms that play a vital role in PEG lipid removal from nanoparticles. One such force is the cohesive interaction of PEG lipids within nanoparticles with other lipid components.",

The considerable number of currently ongoing clinical studies are testament to this fact. These efforts towards the development of LNPs warrant an insight into the fundamental developmental aspects of such systems. In this review, we discuss the key design aspects that confer efficacy to a LNP delivery system, i.e., potency, biodegradability, and immunogenicity. We also cover the underlying considerations regarding the route of administration and targeting of LNPs to hepatic and non-hepatic targets. Furthermore, since LNP efficacy is also a function of drug/nucleic acid release within endosomes, we take a holistic view of charged-based targeting approaches of LNPs not only in the context of endosomal escape but also in relation to other comparable target cell internalization strategies. Electrostatic charge-based interactions have been used in the past as a potential strategy to enhance the drug release from pH-sensitive liposomes. In this review, we cover such strategies around endosomal escape and cell internalization in low pH tumor micro-environments.\n## PEG Shedding\nThe PEG shedding strategy used in recently developed LNP systems is based on PEG lipid desorption from the LNP surface upon entering systemic circulation. The PEG coating on one hand prevents the aggregation of liposomes upon storage and to some extent in vivo also, but on the other hand hinders interactions of lipid nanoparticles with target cell membranes and their subsequent internalization [50,51]. Ideally, the PEG layer should be removed at the site of action. \n\nThe way the PEG coating is exploited for targeting/stability has varied over the years by either making it a more stable component of LNP systems to evade undesired immune responses while in systemic circulation, as in the case of intravenously administered LNPs, or by applying the PEG coating as a transient component which provides stability upon storage but sheds in vivo upon interaction with serum proteins, as is the case for intramuscularly administered LNPs. The shedding of PEG relies on (i) shorter carbon chain lengths of the lipid that is conjugated to the PEG, (ii) the concentration of serum proteins in vivo, and (iii) the time of exposure to serum proteins [52]. In an in vitro study, Gallud et al. [52] demonstrated an increase in the uptake of PEGylated LNPs in Huh 7 cells when LNPs were pre-incubated in fetal bovine serum (FBS). Moreover, the increase in LNP uptake was proportional to the amount of FBS present and the time of incubation. They also showed that LNPs anchored to streptavidin via Biotin-mediated binding were released as the medium was exposed to FBS, providing a clear insight into the FBS-mediated release of PEG lipids. However, the precise mechanism of stimulation by serum proteins to augment the PEG lipid release from the LNPs is still unknown. \n\nAdditionally, there are other mechanisms that play a vital role in PEG lipid removal from nanoparticles. One such force is the cohesive interaction of PEG lipids within nanoparticles with other lipid components.",

[9,64] These components confer distinct advantages to LNPs in delivering nucleic acid drugs. The nucleic acid component of these drugs is negatively charged, while the ionizable cationic lipids, a critical component of LNPs, feature a positively charged hydrophilic amino head in acidic environments. This allows for the encapsulation of nucleic acids within the lipid nanoparticles via electrostatic interactions. In a neutral plasma environment, these lipids are uncharged, thus avoiding uptake by monocyte macrophages, reducing toxicity, and finally becoming endosomes for release into the cytoplasm through megacellular drinking. [65] Among them, the key to improve the delivery efficiency is the release of LNPs from endosomes, i.e., the efficiency of endosome escape. The mechanism of endosomal escape is closely related to ionizable cationic lipids. One theory hypothesizes that cationic lipids interact with anionic phospholipids in the endosomal membrane to form a non-bilayer structure and disrupt the endosomal membrane, thereby releasing nucleic acids. [66] In contrast, another hypothesis suggests that the delivery efficiency of cationic lipids can be attributed to the pro-ton sponge phenomenon, in which buffering cationic polymers bind protons in the endosomes and activate the endosomal proton pump, allowing chloride ions to enter the endosomes along with the protons, elevating the osmotic pressure and causing the endosomes to swell and rupture. [67] However, the inefficiency of endosomal escape and the unidentified mechanism still make it a rate-limiting step in the delivery of LNPs. [68] PEGylated lipids prevent the aggregation of LNPs, while phospholipids contribute to nanoparticle formation. Cholesterol enhances the stability of nucleic acid-lipid nanoparticles and promotes their fusion with cellular membranes. [9,69,70]",

Therapeutic options for advanced HCC remain sparse, with efficacy significantly hampered by the emergence of drug resistance. In parallel with research into novel pharmacological agents, advances in drug delivery systems represent a promising avenue for overcoming resistance. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have demonstrated considerable efficacy in the delivery of nucleic acid\u2010based therapeutics and hold potential for broader applications in drug delivery. This review describes the development of LNPs tailored for HCC treatment and consolidates recent investigations using LNPs to target HCC.\n## BASIC Structure of LNPs\nThe typical structure of LNPs comprises four essential components: ionizable cationic lipids, phospholipids, cholesterol, and PEGylated lipids. [9,64] These components confer distinct advantages to LNPs in delivering nucleic acid drugs. The nucleic acid component of these drugs is negatively charged, while the ionizable cationic lipids, a critical component of LNPs, feature a positively charged hydrophilic amino head in acidic environments. This allows for the encapsulation of nucleic acids within the lipid nanoparticles via electrostatic interactions. In a neutral plasma environment, these lipids are uncharged, thus avoiding uptake by monocyte macrophages, reducing toxicity, and finally becoming endosomes for release into the cytoplasm through megacellular drinking. [65] Among them, the key to improve the delivery efficiency is the release of LNPs from endosomes, i.e., the efficiency of endosome escape. The mechanism of endosomal escape is closely related to ionizable cationic lipids. One theory hypothesizes that cationic lipids interact with anionic phospholipids in the endosomal membrane to form a non-bilayer structure and disrupt the endosomal membrane, thereby releasing nucleic acids. [66] In contrast, another hypothesis suggests that the delivery efficiency of cationic lipids can be attributed to the pro-ton sponge phenomenon, in which buffering cationic polymers bind protons in the endosomes and activate the endosomal proton pump, allowing chloride ions to enter the endosomes along with the protons, elevating the osmotic pressure and causing the endosomes to swell and rupture. [67] However, the inefficiency of endosomal escape and the unidentified mechanism still make it a rate-limiting step in the delivery of LNPs. [68] PEGylated lipids prevent the aggregation of LNPs, while phospholipids contribute to nanoparticle formation. Cholesterol enhances the stability of nucleic acid-lipid nanoparticles and promotes their fusion with cellular membranes. [9,69,70]",

To decipher the underlying mechanisms contributing to the lung-specificity of LSNPs-mediated protein delivery, we performed a comprehensive analysis of various factors influencing the tissue tropism of nanoparticles. These included an examination of nanoparticles surface charge, size, and protein corona formed in vivo. We first compared the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles showing liver (assembled at \u03b2-CD-PEI to Ada-MOP of 6:1) and lung (assembled at \u03b2-CD-PEI to Ada-MOP of 10:1)-targeting effect. As shown in SI Appendix, Fig. S13A (SI Appendix), both types of nanoparticles exhibited an average diameter of around 110 nm. However, there was a significant difference exists between the nanoparticle surface charge: lungtargeted LSNPs exhibited a higher positive zeta potential (19.8 mV) compared to liver-targeted LSNPs (7.81 mV). This disparity in charge led us to hypothesize that it significantly influences plasma protein adsorption on nanoparticle surface in circulation, thereby dictating tissue specificity. To verify this hypothesis, we performed proteomic profiling of the surface-absorbed protein of LSNPs incubated with murine serum. After isolating surfaceadsorbed proteins, mass spectrometry analysis revealed distinct protein corona composition for these nanoparticles. Lung-targeted nanoparticles harbored 375 proteins, while liver-targeted ones contained 433 proteins, with 277 proteins common to both (SI Appendix, Fig. S13B). A Venn diagram illustrated the protein distribution (SI Appendix, Fig. S13B), indicating 98 unique proteins to lung-targeted nanoparticles. Among the top twenty most abundant proteins, only nine were shared between the two types of nanoparticles. Notably, liver-targeted nanoparticles predominantly exhibited apolipoprotein A (ApoA), aligning with prior reports of the role of ApoA in hepatic-targeting delivery (SI Appendix, Fig. S13C) (24,25).",

However, the relationship between the IL structure and LNP endogenous organ-targeting is not well understood. In this study, we developed a novel library of biodegradable ILs featuring beta-propionate linkers, which, when incorporated into a four-component LNP formulation, show excellent extrahepatic selectivity and high protein expression. Methods: We explored the impact of structural modifications in the hydrophobic chains and polar-head groups in the ILs while keeping the linkers unchanged. In vivo results were evaluated to examine how structural changes influence the biodistribution to spleen or lungs. LNP formulations were assessed for their protein expression levels and organ-specific targeting. Additionally, protein corona formation by the best-performing LNPs was examined to provide further mechanistic insights. Results: Organ targeting was significantly influenced by structural changes in the ILs, allowing for precise control of the biodistribution between the spleen and lungs. Branched hydrophobic chains demonstrated a higher propensity for spleen targeting, while modifications in the polar-head group could drastically shift biodistribution from the lung to the spleen. This led to the identification of LNPs\u2019 zeta potential as a key determinant of their extrahepatic targeting properties. Notably, ionizable lipid A3T2C7, also known as CP-LC-1495, displayed strong lung selectivity (97%) and high protein expression in lung tissue (1.21 \u00d7 108 p/s). Similarly, several promising candidates for spleen-targeting LNPs displayed protein expression levels exceeding 1 \u00d7 107 p/s (selectivity >80%). Conclusions: This study elucidates the structure\u2013function relationships of ILs in passive organ-specific mRNA delivery, highlighting how the fine-tuning of hydrophobic chains, polar-head groups, and surface charge (zeta potential) allows for the precise control of LNP endogenous biodistribution, a mechanism influenced by protein corona formation. These findings enable the rational design of targeted LNP systems, enhancing their therapeutic potential for specific organs, such as the spleen and lungs.",

With that purpose, we selected and purified the two top-performing ionizable lipids for lung targeting (A1T2C3, also named CP-LC-1067, and A3T2C7, also named CP-LC-1495) and the highestperforming lipid for spleen targeting (A2T2C9, also named CP-LC-1465).

Subsequently, to mimic the in vivo environment, we incubated LNPs with human plasma, allowing the natural formation of a protein corona similar to that occurring in the bloodstream (Figure 4A).

As a result, many therapeutic approaches to treating disorders associated with the central nervous system (CNS) still only show limited success. Nano-sized systems are being explored as drug carriers and show great improvements in the delivery of many therapeutics. The systemic delivery of nanoparticles (NPs) or nanocarriers (NCs) to the brain involves reaching the neurovascular unit (NVU), being transported across the blood\u2013brain barrier, (BBB) and accumulating in the brain. Each of these steps can benefit from specifically controlled properties of NPs. Here, we discuss how brain delivery by NPs can benefit from careful design of the NP properties. Properties such as size, charge, shape, and ligand functionalization are commonly addressed in the literature; however, properties such as ligand density, linker length, avidity, protein corona, and stiffness are insufficiently discussed. This is unfortunate since they present great value against multiple barriers encountered by the NPs before reaching the brain, particularly the BBB. We further highlight important examples utilizing targeting ligands and how functionalization parameters, e.g., ligand density and ligand properties, can affect the success of the nano-based delivery system.",

Corona composition is dynamic, and protein mobility plays an important role in the desorption/adsorption process. The Vroman effect addresses protein corona formation in materials exposed to a physiological environment and postulates that protein exchange will change corona composition, while the overall quantity of proteins remains roughly the same [163,164]. As reported for many cellular types, the uptake levels and mechanisms of internalization of nanoparticles are affected by the composition of this protein corona [165][166][167][168]. Particle biodistribution and clearance are also significantly influenced by the protein corona. Proteins such as serum albumin, apolipoproteins, fibrinogen, clusterin, and Ig gamma and light chains are commonly found in the protein corona of nanoparticles [163]. Many of these proteins are relatively featureless in terms of targeting; however, some are well-described ligands that cross the BBB via receptormediated transcytosis, e.g., Apo E. There have been promising attempts of controlling the corona formation to improve brain delivery of NPs. For example, Zhang et al. reported the functionalization of PEG-liposomes with a short peptide that binds to the lipid-binding domain of apolipoproteins, leaving the receptor-binding domain available to interact with lipoprotein receptor-related proteins and scavenger receptors class B, which affected intracranial glioma accumulation and notable increases in brain distribution [169]. Even though the protein corona is of interest in brain delivery, it also poses challenges in the investigation of particle properties [170][171][172]. \n\nCoating nanoparticles with molecules that avoid protein adsorption is a broadly implemented strategy in nanotherapeutic systems, and PEGylation is the most common approach.",

Paulusse\n## Abstract\nSafe and reliable entry to the brain is essential for successful diagnosis and treatment of diseases, but it still poses major challenges. As a result, many therapeutic approaches to treating disorders associated with the central nervous system (CNS) still only show limited success. Nano-sized systems are being explored as drug carriers and show great improvements in the delivery of many therapeutics. The systemic delivery of nanoparticles (NPs) or nanocarriers (NCs) to the brain involves reaching the neurovascular unit (NVU), being transported across the blood\u2013brain barrier, (BBB) and accumulating in the brain. Each of these steps can benefit from specifically controlled properties of NPs. Here, we discuss how brain delivery by NPs can benefit from careful design of the NP properties. Properties such as size, charge, shape, and ligand functionalization are commonly addressed in the literature; however, properties such as ligand density, linker length, avidity, protein corona, and stiffness are insufficiently discussed. This is unfortunate since they present great value against multiple barriers encountered by the NPs before reaching the brain, particularly the BBB. We further highlight important examples utilizing targeting ligands and how functionalization parameters, e.g., ligand density and ligand properties, can affect the success of the nano-based delivery system.\n## Protein Corona\nProtein corona formation is an intrinsic property of nanoparticles that are exposed to biological environments and is often modulated by a nanoparticle's physicochemical properties [160][161][162][163]. Corona composition is dynamic, and protein mobility plays an important role in the desorption/adsorption process. The Vroman effect addresses protein corona formation in materials exposed to a physiological environment and postulates that protein exchange will change corona composition, while the overall quantity of proteins remains roughly the same [163,164]. As reported for many cellular types, the uptake levels and mechanisms of internalization of nanoparticles are affected by the composition of this protein corona [165][166][167][168]. Particle biodistribution and clearance are also significantly influenced by the protein corona. Proteins such as serum albumin, apolipoproteins, fibrinogen, clusterin, and Ig gamma and light chains are commonly found in the protein corona of nanoparticles [163]. Many of these proteins are relatively featureless in terms of targeting; however, some are well-described ligands that cross the BBB via receptormediated transcytosis, e.g., Apo E. There have been promising attempts of controlling the corona formation to improve brain delivery of NPs. For example, Zhang et al. reported the functionalization of PEG-liposomes with a short peptide that binds to the lipid-binding domain of apolipoproteins, leaving the receptor-binding domain available to interact with lipoprotein receptor-related proteins and scavenger receptors class B, which affected intracranial glioma accumulation and notable increases in brain distribution [169]. Even though the protein corona is of interest in brain delivery, it also poses challenges in the investigation of particle properties [170][171][172]. \n\nCoating nanoparticles with molecules that avoid protein adsorption is a broadly implemented strategy in nanotherapeutic systems, and PEGylation is the most common approach.",

We used surface-sensitive fluorescence microscopy with single LNP resolution to investigate the pH dependency of the binding kinetics of ionizable lipid-containing LNPs to a supported endosomal model membrane. A sharp increase of LNP binding was observed when the pH was lowered from 6 to 5, accompanied by stepwise large-scale LNP disintegration.

The LNP binding to the endosomal membrane mimic was observed to eventually become severely limited by suppression of the driving force for the formation of multivalent bonds during LNP attachment or, more specifically, by charge neutralization of anionic lipids in the model membrane due to their association with cationic lipids from earlier attached LNPs upon their disintegration. Cell uptake experiments demonstrated marginal differences in LNP uptake in untreated and lipoprotein-depleted serum, whereas lipoprotein-depleted serum increased mRNA-controlled protein (eGFP) production substantially.

This review discusses the hemocompatibility of different classes of CNs with the purpose of providing biomaterial scientists with a comprehensive vision of the interactions between CNs and blood components. The various complex mechanisms involved in blood compatibility, including coagulation, hemolysis, as well as the activation of complement, platelets, and leukocytes will be considered. Special attention will be paid to the role of CN size, structure, and surface properties in the formation of the protein corona and in the processes that drive blood response.

The corona is typically composed of a \"hard\" portion formed by a thin inner layer of more closely bound proteins, and a \"soft\" outer layer with less tightly bound and fast exchanging proteins. Hydrophobic interactions, electrostatic interactions, van der Waals interactions, hydrogen bonds, and \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking can contribute in various degree to NP-protein interaction depending on the nature of both nanomaterials and protein media. The protein corona represents the new and dynamic NP interface with the external environment. Experimental studies investigating the nature and composition of the protein corona presented disparate outcomes, both because of the variety of NP and because of the different analytical methods used. A set of 125 plasma proteins has been found to associate with nanomaterials [60], and among these albumin, immunoglobulins, apolipoprotein A-I, and complement components have been frequently found in the nanomaterial corona [61]. If the proteins forming the corona undergo conformational changes with respect to their native structure, their functionality may be impaired, and their regular biological activity may be altered, causing abnormal interactions with other blood components [62]. Thus, the global NP-protein system is responsible for potential adverse events in the cardiovascular system, including thrombosis, complement and leukocyte activation, and hemolysis. Opsonization by complement components and immunoglobulins can, for example, cause the activation of the immune system and receptor-mediated phagocytosys, influencing the rapidity of clearance from the blood stream and/or the biodistribution in different target organs. The blood protein corona has also effects on NP dispersion/aggregation, as well as on circulation time, biodistribution and targeting efficiency of nanomedicines [63], and in some cases was hypothesized to contribute protecting RBC membrane from lysis [64].

Fedel\n## Abstract\nCarbon nanostructures (CNs), such as carbon nanotubes, fullerenes, carbon dots, nanodiamonds as well as graphene and its derivatives present a tremendous potential for various biomedical applications, ranging from sensing to drug delivery and gene therapy, biomedical imaging and tissue engineering. Since most of these applications encompass blood contact or intravenous injection, hemocompatibility is a critical aspect that must be carefully considered to take advantage of CN exceptional characteristics while allowing their safe use. This review discusses the hemocompatibility of different classes of CNs with the purpose of providing biomaterial scientists with a comprehensive vision of the interactions between CNs and blood components. The various complex mechanisms involved in blood compatibility, including coagulation, hemolysis, as well as the activation of complement, platelets, and leukocytes will be considered. Special attention will be paid to the role of CN size, structure, and surface properties in the formation of the protein corona and in the processes that drive blood response. The aim of this review is to emphasize the importance of hemocompatibility for CNs intended for biomedical applications and to provide some valuable insights for the development of new generation particles with improved performance and safety in the physiological environment.\n## Protein Corona\nOnce injected in a biological fluid, such as blood plasma, nanoparticles (NPs) are rapidly coated with a layer of proteins forming the so-called \"protein corona\" [57,58] in a dynamic process which does not reach the thermodynamic equilibrium [59]. The corona is typically composed of a \"hard\" portion formed by a thin inner layer of more closely bound proteins, and a \"soft\" outer layer with less tightly bound and fast exchanging proteins. Hydrophobic interactions, electrostatic interactions, van der Waals interactions, hydrogen bonds, and \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking can contribute in various degree to NP-protein interaction depending on the nature of both nanomaterials and protein media. The protein corona represents the new and dynamic NP interface with the external environment. Experimental studies investigating the nature and composition of the protein corona presented disparate outcomes, both because of the variety of NP and because of the different analytical methods used. A set of 125 plasma proteins has been found to associate with nanomaterials [60], and among these albumin, immunoglobulins, apolipoprotein A-I, and complement components have been frequently found in the nanomaterial corona [61]. If the proteins forming the corona undergo conformational changes with respect to their native structure, their functionality may be impaired, and their regular biological activity may be altered, causing abnormal interactions with other blood components [62]. Thus, the global NP-protein system is responsible for potential adverse events in the cardiovascular system, including thrombosis, complement and leukocyte activation, and hemolysis. Opsonization by complement components and immunoglobulins can, for example, cause the activation of the immune system and receptor-mediated phagocytosys, influencing the rapidity of clearance from the blood stream and/or the biodistribution in different target organs. The blood protein corona has also effects on NP dispersion/aggregation, as well as on circulation time, biodistribution and targeting efficiency of nanomedicines [63], and in some cases was hypothesized to contribute protecting RBC membrane from lysis [64]. Despite considerable challenges due to the shortage of adequate techniques and protocols for the analysis of the extremely complex nano(protein)",

After NPs enter the body, they interact with plasma proteins, tumour cell receptors, and small biological molecules. This interaction is closely related to the size, shape, chemical composition and surface modification properties of NPs. In this review, the effects of the size, shape, chemical composition and surface modification of NPs on the biological effects of NPs were summarised, including the mechanism through which NPs enter cells, the resulting oxidative stress response, and the interaction with proteins.

                    "text": "Also, due to differences in the surface modification of chemical groups, the formation and composition of the protein corona were different. Proteins quickly coated the surface of the original MWCNT and MWCNT-COOH and made them more compact than MWCNT-PEG, and these compact forms were more effective in protecting cells from the MWCNT surface. Further investigation showed that hydrophobicity was the main reason for the increase in the cellular uptake of the original MWCNTs. However, the protein corona filled with dysoposnins was the major reason for the low uptake of MWCNT-COOH in RAW264.7 cells. The protein corona on MWCNT reduced the exposure of the surface to the medium and limited interactions with cells. As a result, fewer ROS or inflammatory cytokines were produced. Hence, protein binding played a key role in reducing toxicity (Zhang et al., 2019). \n\nSome studies have also shown that the number and types of proteins adsorbed on the surface of NPs are closely related to the properties of NPs. Li et al. synthesised several NPs with similar shapes, sizes, and surface characteristics but different elasticity (45 kPa-760 MPa). After mixing these NPs with mouse plasma, they found that the composition of the protein corona formation changed non-monotonically with the increase in the elasticity of the NPs (Li et al., 2022).

The nanotechnology industry is developing rapidly. The number of multifunctional NPs has increased in the market and hundreds of NPs are in various stages of preclinical and clinical development. Thus, the mechanism underlying the effects of NPs on biological systems has received much attention. After NPs enter the body, they interact with plasma proteins, tumour cell receptors, and small biological molecules. This interaction is closely related to the size, shape, chemical composition and surface modification properties of NPs. In this review, the effects of the size, shape, chemical composition and surface modification of NPs on the biological effects of NPs were summarised, including the mechanism through which NPs enter cells, the resulting oxidative stress response, and the interaction with proteins. This review of the biological effects of NPs can not only provide theoretical support for the preparation of safer and more efficient NPs but also lay the foundation for their clinical application.\n## Protein corona\nAlso, due to differences in the surface modification of chemical groups, the formation and composition of the protein corona were different. Proteins quickly coated the surface of the original MWCNT and MWCNT-COOH and made them more compact than MWCNT-PEG, and these compact forms were more effective in protecting cells from the MWCNT surface. Further investigation showed that hydrophobicity was the main reason for the increase in the cellular uptake of the original MWCNTs. However, the protein corona filled with dysoposnins was the major reason for the low uptake of MWCNT-COOH in RAW264.7 cells. The protein corona on MWCNT reduced the exposure of the surface to the medium and limited interactions with cells. As a result, fewer ROS or inflammatory cytokines were produced. Hence, protein binding played a key role in reducing toxicity (Zhang et al., 2019). \n\nSome studies have also shown that the number and types of proteins adsorbed on the surface of NPs are closely related to the properties of NPs. Li et al. synthesised several NPs with similar shapes, sizes, and surface characteristics but different elasticity (45 kPa-760 MPa). After mixing these NPs with mouse plasma, they found that the composition of the protein corona formation changed non-monotonically with the increase in the elasticity of the NPs (Li et al., 2022). For example, apolipoprotein AI was more likely to form the corona protein over NPs of intermediate elasticity (75-700 kPa). Cheng et al. found that changing the components of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) can make LNPs absorb specific proteins in the blood and target specific organs (Cheng et al., 2020). \n\nThe research team undertook a study to ascertain the relationship between the ligand-protein corona and its biological effects, utilizing Pearson's correlation coefficient analysis. They delved into the impact of the protein corona on how particles are internalised and the subsequent macrophage immune response. \n\nTheir findings revealed that the surface chemistry of AuNRs played a role in determining the protein corona's composition.",

Supplementary Fig. 6). No aggregates were found when incubating LNPs with 10% serum saline 4 h after incubation. However, decomposition of A6 LNPs were observed at 4 h, which may be attributed to the degradation of biodegradable A6 lipids in serum (Supplementary Fig. 6). We then used a size-exclusion column to isolate the \"hard protein corona\" with higher binding affinity of cKK-E12 LNPs, A6 LNPs, and Syn-3 LNPs (Fig. S7) 22,23 and used proteomics to analyze the composition of proteins on LNPs (Supplementary Table 1). Forty-six proteins were detected and quantified (Fig. 2a) on the LNPs. These proteins are involved in the function of complement activation, immune responses, coagulation, acute phase response and lipid metabolism (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Table 1). Previous studies identified apolipopro-teinE (ApoE) as an important protein for LNPs; which can mediate LNP delivery to the liver 24,25 . Consistent with this, we identified ApoE in the corona of all three LNPs, and as the dominant plasma protein in the corona of A6 LNPs. Although the amount of ApoE appears similar in the corona of all three LNPs, the corona of cKK-E12 and Syn-3 LNPs is dominated by a 5-6fold increase in serum albumin concentration, with ApoE composing a much smaller fraction of the corona of these LNPs (Fig. 2b). \n\nSerum albumin and ApoE-mediated cellular uptake.",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulations are a proven method for the delivery of nucleic acids for gene therapy as exemplified by the worldwide rollout of LNP-based RNAi therapeutics and mRNA vaccines. However, targeting specific tissues or cells is still a major challenge. After LNP administration, LNPs interact with biological fluids (i.e., blood), components of which adsorb onto the LNP surface forming a layer of biomolecules termed the \"biomolecular corona (BMC)\" which affects LNP stability, biodistribution, and tissue tropism. The mechanisms by which the BMC influences tissue-and cell-specific targeting remains largely unknown, due to the technical challenges in isolating LNPs and their corona from complex biological media. In this study, we present a new technique that utilizes magnetic LNPs to isolate LNP-corona complexes from unbound proteins present in human serum. First, we developed a magnetic LNP formulation, containing >40 superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs)/LNP, the resulting LNPs containing iron oxide nanoparticles (IOLNPs) displayed a similar particle size and morphology as LNPs loaded with nucleic acids. We further demonstrated the isolation of the IOLNPs and their corresponding BMC from unbound proteins using a magnetic separation (MS) system. The BMC profile of LNP from the MS system was compared to size exclusion column chromatography and further analyzed via mass spectrometry, revealing differences in protein abundances. This new approach enabled a mild and versatile isolation of LNPs and its corona, while maintaining its structural integrity. The identification of the BMC associated with an intact LNP provides further insight into LNP interactions with biological fluids.",

            "text": "Furthermore, we examined the protein corona profiles of our most effective ILs to gain insights into their targeting mechanisms. Our data show that the lipid composition strongly influences their protein adsorption patterns, affecting their physicochemical properties and ultimately controlling tissue tropism. Lung-targeting LNPs exhibited distinct protein enrichment, including of vitronectin and prothrombin, supporting previously described mechanisms of protein corona-mediated lung selectivity [35]. In contrast, the protein-corona composition of spleen-targeting LNPs lacked a clear correlation with known targeting pathways, suggesting an alternative, but as-yet unidentified, mechanism of action. \n\nIn conclusion, these findings provide a strong foundation for the rational design of LNP systems with enhanced organ-targeting precision, guided by the structure-activity relationships of ionizable lipids and the LNP zeta potential. Understanding the molecular basis of extrahepatic targeting, including the key protein interactions that drive LNP accumulation in extrahepatic tissue, will be critical for optimizing these formulations for clinical use. Future studies should aim to elucidate these mechanisms and to evaluate the full safety profile, stability, and therapeutic potential of these LNPs in clinically relevant models. This approach holds significant promise for improving the specificity and efficacy of mRNA-based therapies, enabling more precise extrahepatic delivery and expanding the therapeutic landscape for a broad range of clinical applications, including in vaccines, cancer immunotherapy, and treatments for genetic and inflammatory diseases.",

            "text": "The relationship between plasma and LNP concentrations in terms of corona size is not well studied and the dogma regarding corona formation is based largely on historical data produced (by us among others) using solid lipid nanoparticles (e.g., gold or polystyrene) because these are much easier to handle analytically 8 . Our analysis of LNP corona formation indicates that LNPs are associated with HDL particles. This will make the LNPs larger. Interestingly, similar observations to ours, regarding increases in LNP size of up to 120 nm following corona formation, have recently been reported as well 9 . The LNP size increases we observed (using DLS or NTA analysis) following LNP pull-down are, in Simonsen's opinion, excessive. We have previously shown that LNP size does indeed increase in the presence of serum 4 , but the sizes we reported in the current work (Fig. s13 1 ) were obtained, using unfiltered plasma, following the pull-down procedure, in order to characterize the resulting samples. Furthermore, if the pulldown samples were indeed contaminated by lipoproteins, particularly HDL as speculated by Simonsen, the size measurements would likely exhibit a bias towards smaller values-contrary to our observed results. While accurate in situ size measurements of LNPs with coronas were not the main purpose of this procedure, we do find that the LNPs increase in size following exposure to plasma while remaining functionally and structurally intact (in terms of being able to transfect cells and FRET interactions between the LNP cargo and LNP components). \n\nSimonsen also suggests using Asymmetric Flow Field Flow Fractionation (AF4) as a standard LNP corona isolation control. In addition to being a relatively slow method unsuitable for high-throughput, we are concerned that particles (endogenous and LNPs) and their coronas may be affected by shear forces during the running and focusing steps and prolonged incubation in a buffer environment. In the study that Simonsen cited, the authors also pointed out that AF4 causes the loss of EVs, for example 10 .",

            "text": "When NPs enter the bloodstream, some biomolecules interact with the LNP surface, resulting in their encapsulation and leading to the formation of a corona. This corona is commonly known as protein corona (PC) due to the predominant presence of plasma proteins [38]. The PC formation is a spontaneous process that occurs rapidly thanks to noncovalent interactions between proteins and the LNP surface [119]. \n\nThe presence of PC influences many properties of LNPs such as surface charge, hydrophilic and hydrophobic characteristics, stability, targeting ability, aggregation phenomena, toxicity, and efficacy, and, when RNA or DNA are loaded in LNPs, the PC affected also their transfection efficiency [120,121]. Data published on PC-coated LNPs seem to conflict with each other; in fact, many researchers observed a reduction in the targeting ability of nanoparticles after the PC formation [122], an increase in LNP aggregation, a decrease in LNP stability, and the leakage of fluorophores used for LNP tracking in vivo [123] (Figure 6), while other researchers suggested that the PC formation could be favorable to obtain a specific LNP targeting [1]. \n\nThe PC composition is principally affected by the physico-chemical properties and the biological environment of LNPs; it is also important to underline that the administration of the same LNP formulation to different patients could result in a different interaction of LNP-PC, specific for everyone (depending, as example, on pathological conditions, gender, age, and administration site) [124,125]. The study of the PC seems to be important to obtain a better LNP formulation able to induce the desirable pharmacological effect on each patient [126]. \n\nMany studies demonstrated that a careful selection of the technique (or techniques) used to separate LNPs and PC components is one of the key factors in obtaining realistic results. In particular, LNPs resulted in low-dense soft materials that are hardly separable from the serum nanomaterials, including exosomes and HDL [123,127,128].",

Smaller nanoparticles have a higher surface area relative to their volume, which can influence their interaction with biomolecules. Nanoparticle size and charge also affect delivery efficiency and tissue targeting [174,182,183]. o Example: LNPs originally designed for liver delivery have been repurposed for targeting other organs.

Lipid-based nanoparticles are, however, difficult to study analytically and so our understanding of the interaction between LNPs and biological systems remains obscure, particularly in terms of biomolecular corona formation and the impact this has on therapeutic efficacy and targeting. Ideally, we would like to engineer particles to acquire corona components that facilitate targeting, cargo delivery and improved safety. This requires studying the relationship between LNPs, biofluids and the resulting coronas. The particle-corona complexes are, however, fragile and biofluids also contain particles (such as lipoproteins) with sizes and biochemical characteristics similar to lipid nanoparticles, so contamination with biological components is a challenge. Here we describe a rapid, automated, and unbiased isolation method for LNP biomolecular coronas, coupled with proteomic and lipidomic analysis. Using these analytical methods, we systematically studied, in lean and obese rats, the variation in LNP-mediated mRNA delivery caused by individual physiology. A comprehensive multivariate model links LNP corona content to efficacy, identifying and validating high-density lipoproteins as a previously unidentified factor affecting particle efficacy.",

The protein corona plays a critical role in the recognition and clearance of the particles by the immune system. When particles are inhaled, components of the lung surfactant also form a corona, though the composition differs from that formed by plasma.

LS corona also contains a major lipid component, the most abundant of which are phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylinositol. The protein:lipid ratio of the LS corona is estimated to be 1:10. From a molecular function standpoint, LS corona has enhanced catalytic and structural activity, plasma corona has enhanced antioxidant and enzyme regulation activity, and both have a strong emphasis on binding. (Raesch et al., 2015). \n\nCoarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations found that the structure of LS corona varied with particle surface chemistry. Lipids arranged in a monolayer conformation on hydrophobic polystyrene nanoparticles but arranged in a bilayer on hydrophilic silver nanoparticles. Surfactant proteins B and C are found to interact with the corona lipid layers in parallel and transmembrane orientations respectively, in agreement with their behavior in bulk LS. SP-A is found to bind to nanoparticle surfaces via the carbohydrate recognition domain exclusively. Once the corona is formed, the subsequent pharmacokinetics of inhaled nanoparticles are altered. The LS corona increases the size of nanoparticles, reduces hydrophobicity, and increases the density of surface phosphate groups. These changes mitigate inflammatory potential and promote recognition and clearance of inhaled nanoparticles.

Moreover, the roles of different formulations in differential biological distribution, as well as the general relationship between lipid structure, formulation, and activity, are areas that require further exploration. 122 iScience Review Figure 6. Representative chemical structures of key lipids designed for organ-selective nucleic acids delivery Proteins from plasma are adsorbed onto the LNPs surface to form a protein corona in the blood circulation. The protein corona formed on LNPs after intravenous injection contains hundreds of biomolecules (mainly proteins and lipids). LNPs are cleared and extravasated from the circulation, and ultimately function intracellularly via cellular uptake and undergo organ, cellular, and molecular biological processes. 138 The composition of the protein corona is influenced by the chemical and molecular components of the surface of the LNPs, as well as its charge. This formation of protein coronas allows the fate of LNPs in vivo to be predicted, and even the targeting ligands can be shielded so that LNPs can be delivered less efficiently. Thus, understanding protein corona can help in the design of novel targeted LNPs. 20 sually, the formation of protein corona reduces the delivery efficiency of LNPs, and encapsulation of LNPs on the surface with PEG or other materials usually inhibits the formation of protein corona and prolongs the blood circulation of LNPs. 139 Recent studies have shown that apolipoproteins can be incorporated into protein corona, exerting endogenous targeting properties and playing an important role in organ-and cell-specific targeting of LNPs. 140",

The peaks on the DLS fractograms of nanoparticles incubated with plasma over the range of the retention times between 10 and 20 min are likely to be plasma proteins, suggested by an overlay of the chromatogram of 20% human plasma (Supplementary Figure S17). LNP-RNP particles show a significantly higher derived count rate after incubation with plasma (Figure 2D). These results indicate that these LNP do interact with the plasma components, suggesting formation of a protein corona on the surface of the LNP [32].

The interaction of nanoparticle formulations with cells and proteins in blood has long been discussed [39e41]. Recently, proteins bound to LNPs, called protein corona or biomolecular corona because of their shape, have been the subject of much research attention as factors that contribute greatly to LNP pharmacokinetics [42e45]. The latest findings concerning protein coronas of LNPs, including the analytical technical aspects, were recently reviewed [46]. Although there are still many unknowns owing to the immaturity of the technology, a list of constituents of protein coronas has been developed, that includes serum albumin, complement factors, immunoglobulins, and apolipoproteins. Proteins present in smaller quantities may be important; improving the methods of separation of LNP-protein corona complexes and the sophistication of proteomics technology are key to a more detailed analysis of the protein coronas. The physiological and pathological conditions of patients and animal models, and the route of administration, and their impact on pharmacokinetics are also important factors to consider.\n\nFor a detailed analysis of the intratissue distribution of LNPs, a method that makes use of the Cre/loxP recombinase system is beginning to be used [47e49]. This method uses transgenic mice that have reporter genes (especially fluorescent proteins) downstream of the loxP-flanked stop cassette, which blocks reporter gene expression in the absence of cyclization recombinase (Cre) in the cells, but in the presence of Cre, the stop cassette is removed, and the gene is expressed (Fig. 2) [50]. For example, the typical Ai14 mouse has Lox-Stop-Lox-tdTomato (LSL-tdTomato) inserted into the Rosa26 region, which is a known safe harbor locus for gene insertion into the mouse genome [50]. These",

            "text": "The formation of protein coronas is believed to be closely associated with the biodistribution of nanoparticles in the body. Upon intravenous injection, the nanoparticles come into contact with the serum, leading proteins to adsorb on their surface and form a distinctive protein corona layer [121]. The presence of the protein corona may alter the properties of the nanoparticles, with profound influences for their tissue specificity. For instance, most LNPs exhibit hepatic specificity via intravenous administration, owing to the adsorption of ApoE by binding to the LDLR that are over-expressed on the hepatocytes [121]. Additionally, it has been validated that the knockdown of ApoE lowered the liver targeting of nanomaterials by delivering mRNA into a mouse model lacking ApoE expression [121]. Although the mechanism of endogenous targeting is still not fully explored, researchers have striven to investigate the rules. It is discovered that when the PEG-lipids desorb from LNPs, specific protein binding to LNPs is promoted. The desorption rate of PEG-lipids with longer hydrophobic chains is slower, which might not conducive to formulating appropriate protein coronas and achieving organ targeted delivery [121]. In parallel, nano-vectors with different structures and properties may adsorb different proteins, resulting in protein coronas with distinct components and properties. The formation of protein corona at the interface will alter the physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles, exhibiting a crucial impact on their biodistribution and endocytosis [162]. It has been demonstrated that LNPs with different pKa values can influence their organ targeting. More specifically, the preferred pK a range for liver, spleen, and lung targeting is 6.2~6.5, 2~6, and 7~9, respectively [121,174,175]. These theories have implications for guiding the design of other delivery systems as well.",

            "text": "Once injected in a biological fluid, such as blood plasma, nanoparticles (NPs) are rapidly coated with a layer of proteins forming the so-called \"protein corona\" [57,58] in a dynamic process which does not reach the thermodynamic equilibrium [59]. The corona is typically composed of a \"hard\" portion formed by a thin inner layer of more closely bound proteins, and a \"soft\" outer layer with less tightly bound and fast exchanging proteins. Hydrophobic interactions, electrostatic interactions, van der Waals interactions, hydrogen bonds, and \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking can contribute in various degree to NP-protein interaction depending on the nature of both nanomaterials and protein media. The protein corona represents the new and dynamic NP interface with the external environment. Experimental studies investigating the nature and composition of the protein corona presented disparate outcomes, both because of the variety of NP and because of the different analytical methods used. A set of 125 plasma proteins has been found to associate with nanomaterials [60], and among these albumin, immunoglobulins, apolipoprotein A-I, and complement components have been frequently found in the nanomaterial corona [61]. If the proteins forming the corona undergo conformational changes with respect to their native structure, their functionality may be impaired, and their regular biological activity may be altered, causing abnormal interactions with other blood components [62]. Thus, the global NP-protein system is responsible for potential adverse events in the cardiovascular system, including thrombosis, complement and leukocyte activation, and hemolysis. Opsonization by complement components and immunoglobulins can, for example, cause the activation of the immune system and receptor-mediated phagocytosys, influencing the rapidity of clearance from the blood stream and/or the biodistribution in different target organs. The blood protein corona has also effects on NP dispersion/aggregation, as well as on circulation time, biodistribution and targeting efficiency of nanomedicines [63], and in some cases was hypothesized to contribute protecting RBC membrane from lysis [64]. Despite considerable challenges due to the shortage of adequate techniques and protocols for the analysis of the extremely complex nano(protein)",

            "text": "The study of the protein corona, the immediate and evolving biomolecular coating that forms on the surface of nanoparticles when exposed to a biological environment, is a crucial area in nanomedicine. This phenomenon significantly influences the behavior, functionality, and biological interactions of nanoparticles with biosystems. Until now, conclusions regarding the role of the protein corona in specific biological applications have been based on establishing correlation rather than causation. By understanding causality, researchers can predict how changes in nanoparticle properties or biological conditions will affect protein corona composition, in turn affecting the nanoparticle interactions with the biosystems and their applications. This predictive capability is essential for designing nanoparticles with specific characteristics tailored for therapeutic and diagnostic nanomedicine applications. Here, we explore the concept of \u201cactual causality\u201d (by Halpern and Pearl) to mathematically prove how various small molecules, including metabolites, lipids, vitamins, and nutrients, spiked into plasma can induce diverse protein corona patterns on identical nanoparticles. This approach significantly enhances the depth of plasma proteome profiling. Our findings reveal that among the various spiked small molecules, phosphatidylcholine was the actual cause of the observed increase in the proteomic depth of the plasma sample. By considering the concept of causality in the field of protein corona, the nanomedicine community can substantially improve their ability to design safer and more efficient nanoparticles for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.",

            "text": "TEM, DLS and Zeta potential experiments demonstrated the formation of biomolecular corona already at a low plasma concentration, which led to an increased particle size and to a change in the particle surface charge. SAXS characterization of the drug-loaded nanoparticles before and after incubation in human plasma demonstrated the absence of the multilamellar structure, showing that the presence of the biomolecular corona did not lead to the formation of a multilamellar structure; moreover, a fluorescence-lifetime imaging microscopy analysis on the drugloaded liposomes after incubation revealed that the amount of Doxorubicin in the incubated particles was significantly lower with respect to the pristine ones, suggesting that the exposure to human plasma might degrade the liposomes, altering their persistence in the blood circulation. \n\nOn the other hand, protein coating on liposome carriers (namely, protein corona), is effective in protecting the nanoparticles from degradation in blood, reducing the interaction with leukocytes and prolonging the circulation time in vivo. Giulimondi and colleagues recently demonstrated the protective effect against uptake by blood macrophages of preadsorbed human plasma (HP) protein corona on liposomes obtained from cationic, neutral and anionic lipids. SAXS experiments allowed for evaluating the different effects on the mesostructure of increasing concentrations of plasma proteins adsorbed on the surface of liposomes-these observations demonstrated that the nanostructure of liposomes precoated by HP protein corona depends on the surface charge of the uncoated liposomes. Following these results, the authors showed that the protein corona of pre-coated cationic liposomes is not affected by the interaction with human plasma, suggesting that the nanoparticles' ability to evade sequestration by leukocytes during circulation remains stable. The authors demonstrated that at a low concentration, human plasma protein corona prevents the internalization of cationic liposomes into macrophages, but does not have the same effect on neutrally charged or anionic liposomes. Their findings suggest the possibility to use drug-loaded cationic liposomes coated with low-concentration protein corona to prolong blood circulation and facilitate drug delivery to the target sites [40].",

The expression of the reporter protein proved to be distributed among hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, and endothelial cells at a 70:15:15 ratio. \n\nAnother area of research is assessment of a distribution of LNPs based on ionizable lipids containing an amino head group and an acrylamide tail with a disulfide bond (Qiu et al., 2022). In vivo efficiency of luciferase synthesis (by translation) when fourcomponent LNPs were employed improved with increasing acrylamide tail length, and all the nanoparticles got distributed to lungs. After replacement of helper lipid DOPC (1,2-dioleoyl-snglycero-3-phosphocholine) with either DSPC or DOPE, the lung distribution persisted for LNPs based on the most effective lipid: 306-N16B. Of note, LNPs based on a similar ionizable lipid, 306-O12B (containing an ester bond instead of an amide bond) got completely distributed to the liver. In an analysis of the protein corona of LNPs based on either lipid 306-N16B or lipid 306-O12B, it was found that the LNPs targeted to the liver contain albumin, ApoE, and complement component C1 in the protein corona at 9%, 5%, and 5%, respectively, of the total corona proteins, whereas LNPs targeted to lungs contain albumin, fibrinogen \u03b2-chain, and fibrinogen \u03b3-chain at 17%, 5%, and 5%, respectively, of the total corona proteins.

Then, a fast, automated, and miniaturized method retrieves the LNPs with intact biocoronas, and multiomics analysis of the LNP-corona complexes reveals the particle corona content arising from each individual plasma sample. We find that the most efficacious LNP-corona complexes were enriched with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and, compared to the commonly used corona-biomarker Apolipoprotein E, corona HDL content was a superior predictor of in-vivo activity.

It was suggested that exposure of NPs at a low protein concentration allows relatively few proteins to adhere and distribute on the NPs surface forming a stable NP-protein complex. The protein layers experience a higher degree of conformational changes while masking the NPs surface. However, when the exposure media contains a high concentration of proteins, dense layering occurs and in this case, the majority of the interactions are governed by the adjacent polypeptide fragments. Comparatively lesser conformational changes are noticed since the contact between the NPs surface and the proteins are minimized. 44,45 olystyrene-and silica-NPs (200 nm) demonstrated varied patterns of bound corona upon incubation with an increasing concentration of plasma (3-80%). Densitometric analysis showed that for polystyrene NPs increasing the protein concentration directly increased the amount of bound corona, whereas for silica NPs the amount of protein decreased. SDS-PAGE and LC-MS/MS analysis suggested that in a multiprotein system such a blood plasma, high binding proteins which are present in smaller amounts such as histidine-rich glycoprotein tends to replace low-binding affinity protein such as \ue103brinogen and proteins with a molecular weight in the 50-70 kDa range (present in comparatively much higher amounts in the blood plasma). 44 Similarly, for MNPs, for increasing serum concentration the apolipoprotein E-1 (ApOE-1) protein component signi\ue103cantly increased as compared to albumin and transferrin. 46 Analysis of potential protein adsorptive property of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles (PLGA-NPs) demonstrated that variation in the protein source such as fetal bovine serum (FBS) or human serum, can impact corona formation in terms of both quantity and quality. For 0.08 m 2 area of PLGA-NPs incubated with 50 mL human serum or FBS, the bound protein was observed to be 160.91 mg and 23.08 mg respectively.",

Depending on the chemical identity of nanoparticles the biomolecular corona increases particle size and promotes the formation of clusters of various sizes that can be engulfed by circulating and resident macrophages. Immunogenic serum proteins can activate the complement system leading to the clearance of nanoparticles by phagocytes. Conformational changes in the bound proteins may trigger protein aggregation and amyloid fiber formation. Immunogenic epitope generation caused by protein denaturation activate cell receptors (e.g., the integrin receptor Mac-1) and stimulate signaling pathway leading to the release of inflammatory cytokines.",

            "text": "The composition of the protein corona that forms around LNPs upon exposure to biological fluids is a key factor in their organ selectivity and biodistribution [28,35]. Given this well-established relationship, we sought to investigate whether the differences in our extrahepatic lipid library were reflected in distinct protein corona compositions, which could potentially explain their selective accumulation in non-hepatic tissues. With that purpose, we selected and purified the two top-performing ionizable lipids for lung targeting (A1T2C3, also named CP-LC-1067, and A3T2C7, also named CP-LC-1495) and the highestperforming lipid for spleen targeting (A2T2C9, also named CP-LC-1465). As controls, we included MC3-DOTAP and MC3-18:1 PA, well-established SORT formulations known for targeting the lung and spleen, respectively, with previously characterized protein coronas [12]. Additionally, we incorporated liver-targeting LNPs using SM-102 as the ionizable lipid and a control without LNPs. Subsequently, to mimic the in vivo environment, we incubated LNPs with human plasma, allowing the natural formation of a protein corona similar to that occurring in the bloodstream (Figure 4A). After purification and LNP proteincorona isolation, we performed mass-spectrometry-based proteomic analysis to identify and quantify the adsorbed proteins. \n\nPharmaceutics 2025, 17, x FOR PEER REVIEW 14 of 19 potential was identified as a key factor in organ targeting by our ionizable lipid library, we further analyzed its influence on related protein properties such as isoelectric point (pI) and overall charge. We found that in lung-targeting LNPs, the isoelectric point distribution of adsorbed proteins was slightly shifted toward pI ~5.5 compared with liver-and spleen-targeting LNPs (Figure 4C). This may be attributed to their higher zeta potential, which likely influences protein binding. Notably, vitronectin [12], a key mediator of lung uptake, has a pI of ~5.5, suggesting a potential explanation for this enrichment.",

[69] engineered aerosolized LNPs for pulmonary delivery of mRNA.They optimized PEGylation parameters to achieve efficient mRNA delivery to the lungs.They found that increasing the PEG ratio in the LNP formulation not only reduced the size of LNPs but also decreased intracellular protein expression of mRNA.Therefore, precise consideration of the extent of PEG-anchored lipids is crucial when designing LNP-mRNA for lung therapeutics.This approach represents a significant advancement in developing noninvasive respiratory therapies with potential applications in treating various pulmonary diseases.\n\nThe protein corona phenomenon, mainly influenced by the surface properties of LNPs, has become popular among researchers in the field of nanosized drug delivery systems.After the administration of LNPs, serum proteins are adsorbed on the surface of the nanoparticles evidently, forming a protein corona.This corona may impede targeted efficacy by shielding surface ligands necessary for specific cell or receptor recognition.Surface-exposed PEGylated lipids play a crucial role in determining and regulating the composition of the corona proteins on LNPs.Parallelly, the compositions of the corona proteins can govern the distributions of the nanoparticles due to the organ-specific accumulations of the serum proteins, such as ApoE for the liver and complementary system-related proteins for the spleen.\n\nIn a recent study, Chen et al. [70] investigated the role of apolipoprotein-and vitronectin-enriched corona on LNPs for targeted delivery and transfection of oligonucleotides in murine tumor models.A slight change in the physicochemical properties of LNPs altered the corona pattern.For instance, the introduction of positive charge via cationic lipid 3\u03b2-{N-[2-(dimethylamino) ethyl]carbamoyl}cholesterol (DC-cholesterol) as a substitution for original cholesterol shifted the protein corona pattern from apolipoprotein-rich to vitronectin-rich.",

            "text": "Besides, the effect of serum proteins on ligand-modified LNPs cannot be ignored. Although it is clear that serum proteins will be adsorbed onto the surface of LNPs following the desorption of PEG-lipids upon systemic injections, the protein corona of different ligand-modified LNPs is not well studied yet. A recent study has reported that the nanoparticle protein corona would achieve a maximum thickness in biological fluids when the protein adsorption and desorption rates reached an equilibrium (Stordy et al. 2022). And conjugating targeting ligands to the equilibrated protein corona of the nanoparticles enabled efficient delivery to target cells, while conjugating the ligands to the naked nanoparticles resulted in a 55% reduction of binding affinity to target cells in serum, indicating the potential negative impact of serum proteins on ligand-modified nanoparticles. \n\nWhile various types of ligands were incorporated into LNPs to improve the specific delivery of nucleic acids, the major accessible organs are still limited to the liver, lungs, spleen, and tumor tissues. Indeed, organspecific delivery is often dependent on passive distribution. Only when LNPs reach the organ of interest can they make full use of their targeting moieties to realize specific binding and enhanced uptake (Kedmi et al. 2018). Therefore, it is not surprising that the liver, lungs, and spleen, where LNPs distribute most, and tumors whose vascularization promotes LNP accumulation, are generally easier to reach than other organs. In our view, future directions in LNP-based targeted nucleic acid delivery will be mostly aimed at developing the targeted LNPs to reach the hard-to-access organs (e.g., the brain, kidneys, heart, eyes, and bone) and cell types. A recent study has shown that intraperitoneal administration of LNPs containing cationic helper lipids induced efficient and specific mRNA delivery in the pancreas, which was mediated by peritoneal macrophage exosome secretion (Melamed et al. 2023).",

            "text": "In the case of LNPs, PEG length and alkyl chain affect both surface chemistry and PEG shedding rate [67], thereby influencing the surface coronation and targeting tissues.Pegylation plays a crucial role in determining the in vivo destination of LNPs and their payloads, suggesting its significance for LNP-mRNA therapeutic applications.Despite all the strides made, the underlying mechanisms and relationships between tissue targeting properties of LNP and protein corona formation remain elusive.Certain occurrences, such as the alteration of corona formation, have resulted in changes in tissue accumulation, yet a proper explanation is lacking [70].\n\nPrevious attempts illustrated that specific protein may serve as the nutrition or major supplement for the organs or the cells.There is also an explanation related to the receptor-mediated recognition, for which the most commonly acknowledged one is LDLR-corona protein-ApoE assisted liver targeting of LNP.However, various LDL receptors were identified other than ApoE, such as ApoA1.Basic knowledge related to physiology and pharmacodynamics remains to be explored.Therefore, while we appreciate the creativity of the concept of corona, it currently serves no more than a hypothesis in a long journey to promote LNP-mRNA into clinical stage.The lack of a liable detection technique also hinders the understanding of the protein corona phenomenon and stalls its development.Enabling in situ analysis of protein corona formation is crucial since current post-analysis via centrifugation separation and mass spectrometry is insufficient to unveil the authentic situation of protein adsorption around LNPs in the blood circulation.In a recent work, Zhan and colleagues [97] optimized the extraction of the corona in incubating serum by applying chromatography containing PEG-scFv (single-chain variable fragment).This facilitated the separation of pegylated nanoparticles and proteins while minimizing the depletion of protein corona components.Last but not least, predicting the in vivo performance of the corona protein formation around LNP, especially the stereochemistry and conformation of the absorbed proteins, which are essential to the cell-specific internalizations and successful translation of actively targeted LNP-mRNA, remains challenging.",

Biological fluids have complex compositions and the molecular components interact and function together in intricate networks. Therefore, the process to isolate blood or the preparation of blood derivatives may lead to differences in the composition of the identified protein corona around nanoparticles. Here, we show distinct differences in the protein corona formed in whole blood, whole blood with EDTA, plasma, or serum. Furthermore, the ratio between particle surface area to protein concentration influences the detected corona. We also show that the nanoparticle size per se influences the formed protein corona due to curvature effects.

            "text": "In recent times, novel opportunities have emerged in the realm of bionano interactions, presenting new avenues for the development of targeted NPs. These interactions result in the encapsulation of NPs by biomolecules, leading to the formation of a biomolecular corona, commonly known as the protein corona, due to its predominant enrichment with plasma proteins. Initially, it was observed that the presence of a protein corona on NPs hinders the effectiveness of targeting ligands, 23 thereby impairing the NP's targeting ability. However, it was later recognized that complete avoidance of protein corona formation, even in PEGylated systems, is not feasible. 24 Consequently, efforts were redirected toward harnessing the protein corona as an inherent targeting moiety, as the proteins acquired from the bloodstream could potentially serve as targeting ligands. 25 ur research group has successfully provided direct evidence of targeted delivery of NPs by coating a cationic liposome with a protein corona enriched in vitronectin. 26 This plasma protein bestowed the liposome with the remarkable ability to selectively target and bind to cancer cells that exhibit an elevated level of expression of the vitronectin receptor. A recent scientific hypothesis has suggested that the high liver tropism and transfection potency exhibited by Onpattro may be attributed to the formation of a protein corona enriched with Apo-E. 2 This protein corona, in turn, enables the recognition of hepatocytes through the LDL receptor, potentially contributing to its liver-targeting capabilities. \n\nIn the context of vaccination, the translation of LNP vaccines into clinical practice faces challenges due to our limited understanding of their protein corona, which may influence the tissue accumulation of particles in physiological environments. Upon ID, LNP vaccines are exposed to the dermal interstitial fluid (DIF) 27 leading to the formation of a protein corona. Given that the protein source is a key determinant in shaping the composition of the protein corona, 28 we assert that conducting a thorough investigation of LNPs in the DIF is an essential and decisive step in advancing our comprehension of their mechanism of action upon intradermal injection.",

Silica nanoparticles (SiO 2 nanoparticles) of 50 nm diameter were used as a representative model system to form different coronas in the two conditions. It is known that varying serum amount can lead to formation of different coronas. 28 Then, the effect of serum content on the uptake efficiency in HeLa cells was investigated, and common pharmacological inhibitors of endocytosis were used in order to determine potential differences in the mechanisms of uptake in the two conditions. Next, RNA interference was used to silence the expression of the LDL receptor, here selected as a first illustrative example, given the previous reports on its involvement in the uptake of similar silica nanoparticles. 10 This allowed",

This technology enables a rapid and selective method to separate LNP\u2013corona complexes and enables in-depth characterization of the BMC while maintaining the particle integrity.",

            "text": "An IV dose of nanoparticles exposes the blood to massive amounts of foreign surface area, but nanoparticles can also indirectly activate clotting by interacting with cells that affect clotting processes, such as endothelial cells, neutrophils, and platelets.Noting that the dominant nanomedicine targeting method now employs manipulation of nanoparticle charge, it is important to revisit the thrombotic side effects of nanomedicines [16][17][18][19][20][21] , with a focus on the new targeting approaches.\n\nHere we show that lung-tropic LNPs with positively charged lipids induce massive thrombosis.This finding was quite general, as it held for LNPs with widely varying ionizable lipids, different positively charged lipids, and not just LNPs, but also liposomes.The lung-tropic LNPs induced profound pulmonary embolism when administered intravenously, induced stroke-like effects when administered via the carotid artery, and modified clotting processes in ex vivo blood.We have investigated detailed mechanisms of LNP-induced clotting, showing lung-tropic LNPs bind to the core clotting protein, fibrinogen, and cause aggregation and activation of platelets.Elucidating these detailed mechanisms of clotting enabled us to develop three solutions that may permit positively charged LNPs to maintain their excellent lung targeting while not inducing dangerous clotting: Pre-treatment with anticoagulants (direct thrombin inhibitors, but not the seemingly obvious choice of heparin), conjugation of the LNPs to direct thrombin inhibitors, or reduction of the LNP size.",

            "text": "The stability of an artificial protein corona in a protein-rich environment (such as the bloodstream and the cytoplasm) is a key requirement for its effectiveness. This is because the corona stability influences its ability to maintain its composition and structure over time 1,2 . In a protein-rich environment, various proteins are present that can potentially interact with the corona. If the corona is not stable, it may undergo structural changes or disintegrate, leading to alterations in its composition. This can have significant implications for the corona's functionality, including its ability to influence interactions between the NP and biological systems. As an example, Qin et al. 3 demonstrated that an intracellular protein corona (IPC) can form on nanoparticles once they are taken up by cells. This IPC has the potential to significantly impact the intracellular transport network of these NPs. A stable protein corona is therefore crucial for maintaining the specific interactions and properties that were designed or intended. It helps ensure that the corona continues to serve its intended purpose, whether it is to enhance biocompatibility, modulate cellular uptake by engaging specific receptors, or influence other aspects of nanoparticle behavior. \n\nFor this purpose, we prepared coronated LNP and LNPi at different plasma percentages. Each batch was aliquoted into two portions. The first represents the formulation as synthesized in the laboratory, constituting the system ready for in vivo applications. This batch was kept as is for 1 hour at 37 \u00b0C. Simultaneously, the second batch was exposed to 50% HP, i.e., the percentage of plasma commonly used in literature to mimic the injection of NPs into the circulatory system. Finally, we employed SDS-PAGE to compare the corona composition of coronated LNP and LNPi before and after plasma exposure (the electrophoretic gel is shown in Supplementary Figure 6a). First, we observe that the electrophoretic profiles of coronated LNP (light gray) change as a function of protein concentration. This first observation is in line with previous results obtained with lipid gene vectors 4 , and other NP types 5 . After exposure to 50% high protein concentration (depicted in dark grey), LNP displayed very similar protein profiles.",

            "text": "When flowing through the blood stream, drug carriers such as nanoparticles encounter hundreds of plasma proteins, forming a protein layer on the nanoparticle surface, known as the \u201cprotein corona\u201d. Since the protein corona influences the size, shape, and surface properties of nanoparticles, it can modulate their circulating lifetime, cytotoxicity, and targeting efficiency. Therefore, understanding the mechanism of protein corona formation at the atomic scale is crucial, which has become possible due to advances in computer power and simulation methodologies. This review covers the following topics: (1) the structure, dynamics, and composition of protein corona on nanoparticles; (2) the effects of protein concentration and ionic strength on protein corona formation; (3) the effects of particle size, morphology, and surface properties on corona formation; (4) the interactions among lipids, membranes, and nanoparticles with the protein corona. For each topic, mesoscale, coarse-grained, and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations since 2020 are discussed. These simulations not only successfully reproduce experimental observations but also provide physical insights into the protein corona formation. In particular, these simulation findings can be applied to manipulate the formation of a protein corona that can target specific cells, aiding in the rational design of nanomedicines for drug delivery applications.",

Blood samples were collected via submandibular puncture (1 min and 1 h) and cardiac puncture (4 h), and Cy5.5 signal in serum was quantified by fluorescent spectroscopy. After 4 h, mice were sacrificed, organs perfused with PBS and tissues were collected for Cy5.5 and siAR quantification.

            "text": "The complexes formed by NPs with proteins and sugars are described as protein coronas (PCs). \n\nAs PCs travel through the body, interactions with different molecules occur and the coronas may dissolve, form conglomerates or even new compounds with unique properties. This process is known as \"from synthetic to biological identity\" and describes changes from the NPs properties designed in the laboratory to those gained by their interaction with a specific biological environment. This means that any NPs exposed to the body may form biological medium-related, unique coronas, which exert some impact on both antibacterial and toxicological activities. 7][78] Several factors play a role in the whole interaction process between NPs and protein-rich biological fluids. Lundqvist et al. 12 showed that the size of the NPs influenced this process due to the curvature effect in human blood serum. They proved this in a study where silica nanoparticles of the same type but of various sizes differently influenced the binding of A-lipoprotein from human blood. The smaller the NPs, the greater the number of proteins that bound as PCs. Also, they showed that the bigger the NP size, the more up-regulated the thrombin-generation assay. The authors, therefore, showed that the same NPs, but of various sizes, may affect the organism response in different ways. Also, Ajdar et al. 76 showed that gold nanoparticles added to human blood generated a faster prothrombotic response (in a nonlinear size dependent manner). They also showed the concentration dependent manner of the prothrombogenic effects and reduction of time until initial clot formation. Moreover, they noticed that clot strength decreased significantly in line with the size of the NPs added. 76 he aforementioned studies confirmed the extreme diversification of the interactions between NPs and biological fluids. Few studies have yet evaluated PC formation in the oral cavity, or sufficiently explained their impact on the oral mucosa and its permeability. 3",

Three different lipases have been described including the lipoprotein and endothelial lipase in LSECs and the hepatic lipase in hepatocytes [161]. LNP-siRNA systems that incorporate ionizable cationic lipids that are sensitive to endothelial lipase (e.g. ester linkages between head and tail functions) have enhanced gene silencing in hepatocytes but exhibit significantly reduced activity in LSECs [159]. Co-treatment with lipase inhibitors or incorporating lipase-resistant ionizable cationic lipids can recover gene silencing in LSECs [159].\n\nBased on microanatomical, subcellular, and (patho)physiological considerations, an ideal LNP for gene regulation in hepatocytes must satisfy the following design criteria: nanoparticle size < 80 nm to efficiently pass through liver fenestrae and improve LNP stability, apparent ionizable cationic lipid pKa value around 6.4, near neutral surface charge to prevent sequestration by the MPS, and lack of immune stimulation and toxic effects. Achieving these and other criteria facilitating efficient nucleic acid entrapment and LNP formulation are detailed in the following section.\n\nIt is important to mention that upon intravenous administration LNPs adsorb serum proteins on their surface. Many, if not all, of the abovementioned physiochemical characteristics impart distinct properties to the LNPs which ultimately influence protein adsorption. This \"biomolecular corona\" covering nanoparticles significantly impacts systemic circulation and nano-bio interactions [162][163][164]. Efficient targeting and gene regulation in hepatocytes stems from the presence of ApoE in the corona of LNPs and enabled the success of Onpattro\u00ae [33,76]. A recent publication suggested that the ionizable lipid composition plays a major role in the corona formed [165].

            "text": "The interaction of nanoparticles with physiological systems-the so-called \"nano-bio interface\"-is a complex process. It is therefore important to understand this mechanism in some detail before we delve into strategies to bypass first-pass metabolism. As we discussed, a nanoparticle's inherent composition, shape, size, and surface chemistry plays a crucial part in deciding its fate in systemic circulation. In this section, we discuss the role of two external parameters that play equally vital roles to affect circulation stability and the final disposition of a nanoparticle to the tumor: (i) formation of a protein corona and (ii) the mechanism of interactions between the nanoparticle and cells. \n\nWhen a nanoparticle enters the blood, it is coated with various serum proteins, forming a protein corona that changes the nanoparticle's synthetic identity, exposes new epitopes, and alters its function. The concept of a protein corona is thus an important parameter in shaping the final biological identity of the nanoparticle-hydrodynamic size, surface chemistry, net charge, and aggregation behavior [30,32,64]. Although this has been known for a long time, it is only recently that researchers were able to decipher the complex mixture of adsorbed proteins on nanoparticles. This was mainly led by the advancement of instrumentation and analytical methods, coupled with the motivation to shake the existing stagnancy of clinical translation for nanomedicine delivery systems [65][66][67]. Albumin, apolipoprotein, immunoglobulins, transferrin, fibrinogen, complement C3, haptoglobin, and \u03b1-2-macroglobulin are some of the most abundant proteins that comprise the protein corona [32,68]. Nanoparticles interact with these proteins mainly through long range electrostatic Van der Waal's forces, as well as short-range hydrophobic interactions [33]. There are two types of proteins in the protein corona [65,66]: opsonin and dysopsonin.",

            "text": "Recent studies have shown that apolipoproteins can be incorporated into protein corona, exerting endogenous targeting properties and playing an important role in organ-and cell-specific targeting of LNPs. 140 Understanding the components of LNPs and the nature of the protein coronas will be more useful in understanding the subsequent fate of LNPs in vivo and in designing organ-targeted LNPs for treating specific diseases. 122 ince apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is involved in endogenous cholesterol transport, it binds to the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) overexpressed in hepatocytes and enters the cell via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Thus, ApoE-rich protein corona can be used to target hepatocytes. 141,142 Lung targeting of LNPs can be achieved by introducing sequences of lipid molecules that can alter the composition of the protein corona, and the unique protein corona formed promotes the interaction of LNPs with specific cellular receptors that are highly expressed in the lung. 47 It has been shown that LNPs containing lipid molecules with quaternary ammonium head groups (SORT) can be applied to gene editing of endothelial, epithelial, and immune cells in the lung. 47,48 In addition, lipid molecules characterized by cationic quaternary sulfonamide-amino lipids, amphoteric amino lipids, and doped amide bonds are also capable of delivering nucleic acids to the lungs in a better way. 35,143 Targeting of lymphoid tissues can be achieved by adjusting the ratio of lipid molecules to form protein corona. Protein corona formation by LNPs combined with anionic phospholipids such as b2-glycoprotein I enables gene editing of B and T cells in the splenic region. 42 or endogenous targeting, various novel technologies can be used to characterize the formation of protein coronas, identify the organ targeting results required for protein corona combinations, and associate them with nanoparticles, which is crucial for fully utilizing this targeting mechanism. 144,145",

It plays an important role in the colloidal stability of NPs, which is of importance for most of their medical applications and toxicity assessment. While typical studies use either blood plasma or serum from a pooled biobank, it is unclear whether differences in the media, such as cholesterol level or protein concentration, might affect the NP colloidal stability and corona composition. In this study, the silica corona was prepared at particularly low plasma concentrations (3%, v/v\u20131.98 mg/mL) to identify the critical roles of the protein mass/NP surface ratio and the level of plasma cholesterol on the corona protein pattern and particle stability. While depending on the plasma dilution factor, the corona protein composition could be controlled by keeping the protein/NP constant. The NP colloidal stability was found to strongly correlate with the level of cholesterol in human plasma, particularly due to the high enrichment of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in the corona. A cohort study on plasma samples from individuals with known cholesterol levels was performed to highlight that association, which could be relevant for all corona systems enriched with the LDL.",

This is since protein adsorption is mediated (in part) by hydrophobic interactions. 57 As demonstrated by Maiorano et al. utilising Dulbecco's Modi\ue103ed Eagle medium (DMEM) and Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium (RPMI), supplemented with Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), bio\ue104uid composition is a prominent extrinsic in\ue104uencer of corona formation. The two media (which vary in their salt, glucose and amino acid content) induced dissimilar adsorption patterns, with citrate-stabilised gold nanoparticles gaining a more abundant and stable corona in DMEM at all tested sizes. 58 Consistently, an increase in plasma concentration (from 3% to 80%) corresponded to a notable increase in protein adsorption for polystyrene nanoparticles. For silica nanoparticles, increasing plasma concentration instead induced considerable changes in the protein pattern, illustrative of competitive adsorption by less-abundant, high-affinity proteins due to enhanced adhesion at higher plasma concentrations. 59 Finally, nanoparticles which interact with proteins electrostatically have been reported to experience pH-dependent corona formation by reason of an altered protein binding affinity. 60 The instantaneous adsorption of proteins by nanoparticles may alter their physicochemical attributes (including size and surface charge), thereby providing them with a new biological identity. Thus, it is not pristine nanoparticles, but those which are biomolecule-coated that largely govern physiological responses such as systemic circulation time, bioavailability, cellular uptake and cytotoxicity. 61 For instance, the formation of a protein corona around transferrin-functionalised silicon dioxide nanoparticles was shown to eliminate their transferrinmediated targeting capability due to masked receptor-binding sites (Fig. 3). In another study, the coating of gold nanoparticles with polyacrylic acid was shown to cause the unfolding of adsorbed \ue103brinogen which, consequently, evoked an in\ue104ammatory cascade. 11 By",

The formation of such a corona is important to consider, because in any imaginable way a nanoparticle would come in contact with the blood-brain barrier in vivo, it would do so in the presence of a complex mixture of biomolecules in its environment, all of which could potentially adsorb. Indeed, proteins, 49,51,52 lipids 53-56 and sugars 57,58 have all been found in the corona of different nanoparticles in animal-derived biological media, though the proteins are still the most studied. Furthermore, though which biomolecules adsorb differs, the same general phenomenon of a formation of corona is observed in many biological fluids, 59 from blood serum 50,52,60,61 to bronchoalveolar lavage fluid 56 to urine. 59 For nanoparticles approaching the blood-brain barrier, the corona formed in blood serum is perhaps the most important (but not the only; see below) to consider, and this is also the most wellstudied.\n\nIt is a characteristic of the nanoscale, that the adsorption of biomolecules to nanoparticles can be so strong that (some of the) biomolecules will remain with the nanoparticle for much longer than it takes a cell to take up the nanoparticle. [61][62][63][64] This is particularly so for metal, 64 metal oxide 61,62 and other inorganic nanoparticles. 62,63 Still, biomolecular adsorption is sometimes also observed for nanoparticles intended as medicines, e.g., those with grafted ligands, even if PEGylated to prevent unspecific adsorption.

ApoE in blood serum showed specificity for hepatocytes leading to LNP accumulation in the liver as exploited in Onpattro \u00ae formulation. In this product, the drug patisiran is delivered using LNPs composed of ionizable lipid (DLin-MC3-DMA), phosphatidylcholine derivate (DSPC), cholesterol, and PEG-lipid (PEG2000-C-DMG). Once the drug is administered into the systemic circulation, the PEG-lipid is replaced by serum proteins, mainly ApoE, which interact with the cholesterol component of the lipid complex and target the drug to the liver [117,118]. Furthermore, PEG-lipids can be functionalized with specific ligands such as folate for siRNA delivery or N-acetylgalactosamine for targeting liver hepatocytes [80]. \n\nFor instance, the addition of PEG or poloxamine coatings to NPs has been found to reduce complement activation, while dextran coatings increase it.

            "text": "The adsorption of proteins on the surface of nanoparticles when they come in contact with the protein rich environment plays a vital role in deciding the fate of NPs. Several studies have described the role of protein adsorption in biological interactions [84] and have stated that \"Protein corona\" refers to the spontaneous self-assembly or biomolecular coating of the proteins on the surface of nanoparticles [85]. The formation of corona not only alters the physical properties of the nanomaterials such as size, surface charge, shape but also alerts the immune system of the body to recognize the nanoparticles as an intruder and hastens the process of opsonization [86]. Having said that, it becomes important to identify various characterization techniques to detect the extent of protein corona formation. Though several techniques such as quantitative and qualitative proteomic assays have been described to characterize the protein corona formation of the nanoparticles [87], very few studies have reported on its formation around BP nanomaterials. Here, we have discussed the techniques available to characterize the formation of protein corona around the BP nanomaterials. \n\nElectron microscopies, such as TEM, provide a clear picture of protein corona formation around the nanoparticles. For instance, in a previous study [88], the size of BPNSs was increased by 11.9 nm after being covered by plasma proteins and, in another study, the size increased by 30 nm [89]. The corona formation can also be detected by a change in surface charge. The surfaces of BPNSs coated with plasma proteins were entirely different from the native form and the charge changed to a positive value from negative. Liquid chromatography with a mass spectrometry detector was used to qualitatively analyze the components of the BP-corona complex. The results revealed that the binding of proteins to BP directly depends on the protein size and, additionally, the BPNSs mainly bind with immune relevant proteins. The composition of the protein corona can also be evaluated using Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).",

            "text": "One major feature, and limitation at times, with LNP delivery is their propensity for liver accumulation, where they are taken up by the RES [105]. Upon systematic administration [106], various serum electrolytes, proteins, and lipids will adsorb onto the LNP's surface and form the so-called \"biomolecular corona\" [107]. This corona can significantly influence the journey of systematically administered NPs from biodistribution and cellular uptake [108] to systematic circulations and nano-bio interactions [109]. The composition of ionizable lipid particles can have a considerable effect on the formed corona [110]. ApoE is one of the most implicated serum proteins that play a significant role in the clearance and endogenous LNPs targeting to hepatic cells [72]. The delivery of nucleic acids to the liver is partly attributed to the organ's well-perfused nature and its fenestrations as well [100]. It has been recognized that LNPs accumulate in different cells present within the liver [111][112][113]. Particle size, lipase sensitivity, and apparent pKa are some characteristics that govern the intrahepatic distribution of LNPs [114]. Chen et al. investigated the effect of particle size on influencing the tissue penetration and potential of LNP formulations of siRNA. They injected the LNPs intravenously into mice and found that regardless of the size, the majority of LNPs were found 24 h after injection in the liver. Less than 1% of the LNP formulations were found in the kidney, pancreas, lung, heart and femur. However, ~10% of the 80 nm size LNPs was found in the spleen. Since the particle size did not seem to be heavily involved in liver accumulation, they further investigated other parameters that can reduce the potency of small LNPs for silencing. In the end, they concluded that there was a clear hierarchy of LNP formulated siRNAs' capability for gene silencing (78 > 42 > 38 > 27 > 117 nm).",

            "text": "There is limited understanding of the presence of lipid molecules and their adsorption on nanocarriers in the scientific research. In the blood, a lipid associated with protein is known as a lipoprotein. It is complex of apolipoprotein, cholesterol, triglycerides, and phospholipids [106]. Apart from the transportation of lipoprotein in a biological fluid, it is also associated with several other biological processes including tissue repair, coagulation, and immunological responses. \n\nThe proteomic data have suggested that a significant amount of apolipoproteins are present in the protein corona of nanomaterials in vivo. Hellstrand and associates highlighted a report of lipid and plasma protein interaction with nanocarriers. They first pointed out the interaction of lipoprotein complexes with nanomaterials [107]. The surfaceactive agent present in the pulmonary route constituted the outset host defense in deeper part of lungs. The inhaled nanoparticle primarily formed a different corona protein due to the interaction with the lipid and the surfactant-rich pulmonary surface, but the protein corona formed here was different from the PC formed by plasma protein. Further, Raesch and coworkers presented the proteomic analysis of corona formation on NPs using a porcine surfactant as a prototype. The study analyzed the adsorbed biomolecules using LC-MS on to the surface of NPs with varying characteristics viz. lipid-NP, PEG, and PLGA NPs with incubation in a porcine surfactant. The quantitative measurements showed specific lipid compositions in coronas of all investigated NPs. The hydrophilic PEG NPs only showed minimal lipid concentrations, while other NPs indicated high lipid surface binding to nanomaterials. However, the corona formed on NPs was different from corona of plasma protein [108]. \n\nFor the application of nanomaterials in clinics, the physico-chemical properties have to be critically evaluated in a biological medium and the estimation of the results of in vivo studies will greatly help in the clinical translation of nanomaterials. The mouse model is widely used in nanomedicine research to investigate the corona on NPs by incubation with mouse serum.",

            "text": "159 It is clear that the PS corona formed on both nanoparticles consists of a lipoprotein complex that contains both lipids and proteins. The specific structure of the corona and its molecular conformation are affected by the hydrophobicity of the nanoparticle, with a lipid bilayer formed on the hydrophilic silver nanoparticle and a lipid monolayer formed on the hydrophobic polystyrene nanoparticle. The wo hydrophobic surfactant proteins, SP-B and SP-C, appear to mediate the formation of the corona by directly interacting with lipids in the corona, with SP-B orienting in parallel to the lipid bilayer and the helical fragment of SP-C adopting a transmembrane orientation. The hydrophilic SP-A was also found associated with the PS corona, mainly via its carbohydrate recognition domain, albeit to a lesser extent of association than SP-B and SP-C. \n\nAlthough the detailed structure and composition of the PS biomolecular corona are yet to be discovered, both MD simulations and mass spectrometry studies suggest that this corona consists of primarily phospholipids, 167,171 hydrophobic surfactant proteins, 144,145 and hydrophilic surfactant proteins. 123,172,173 A fine balance between electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions may be involved in the formation of the PS biomolecular corona. 145 The PS corona provides the particles with a physicochemical barrier against the environment, reduces the hydrophobicity of the pristine particles, and enhances biorecognition of the particles. 159 uture Directions in Understanding Aerosol Deposition in the Lung. Although plausible, direct clinical evidence for lung infection by virus-laden aerosols is still lacking. A common objection against the likelihood of aerosol transmission is the seemingly insufficient viral concentration to cause an infection, after individual airborne viral emissions in the form of a sneeze or a cough, or after continuous airborne viral emissions in the form of speaking or breathing. The aerosol volumes generated by an individual sneeze and cough are estimated at 1000 and 100 nL, respectively. 174 The aerosol volumes generated by continuous talking and breathing are estimated at 10 and 1 nL/min, respectively. 174",

            "text": "). Protein coronas can concentrate proteins known as opsonins, such as complement proteins, coagulation proteins, and antibodies. Opsonins stimulate immune cell recognition and facilitate rapid clearance of nanoparticles from the bloodstream by immune cells such as macrophages [17,[39][40][41][42][43]. Opsonic properties are also shared by proteins involved in lipid transport such as apolipoprotein A-I and apolipoprotein E [41]. Alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein can act as an opsonin, enhancing macrophage-deactivating mechanisms [44]. Apolipoproteins or other proteins with dysopsonin-like properties, such as histidine-rich glycoprotein, clusterin (apolipoprotein J), and albumin, which are present in protein coronas of nanoparticles (Table 1, column 4), may prolong the time that nanoparticles circulate in blood [41].\n\nInterestingly, protein coronas have also been identified on nanoparticles whose surface has been chemically modified, e.g., through the attachment of hydrophilic polymers such as polyethylene glycol (Table 1, rows 3, 4, and 7), which is useful to lengthen blood circulation times and to decrease the hepatic uptake of the nanoparticles. Protein coronas have been described for nanoparticles both in vivo (as discussed) as well as in vitro (Table 1).\n\nNanoparticles in biological environments including saliva, lung fluid, and blood have been found to interact with phospholipids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and other metabolites, in addition to proteins and peptides [10,45,46]. As a result, a layer of biomolecules (biocorona) may end up coating the nanoparticles' surface giving nanoparticles a new biological identity [26,[30][31][32][33]36,47]. Ultimately, the biocorona mediates interactions between the nanoparticle and the host biological system [15,[30",

            "text": "In another study (Meyer et al., 2022), LNPs containing a positively charged group of the additional lipid and a PLGA polymer also got distributed into lungs and the spleen, and the distribution was influenced by the ratio of a cationic lipid (DOTAP) to an ionizable lipid (MC3). Of note, switching the method of mRNA introduction from encapsulation to adsorption made it possible to achieve up to 80% expression of a target protein in the lungs when composition with a DOTAP/MC3 ratio of 1:1 was employed, and up to 50% expression in the spleen with composition featuring a DOTAP/MC3 ratio of 3:1. Nanoparticles carrying adsorbed mRNA had a size of ~200 nm and did not accumulate in kidneys during excretion, likely indicating the suitability of such particles for subsequent pharmaceutical research and development. In addition, these nanoparticles did not contain cholesterol, and Cy5-labeled mRNA was detectable but not expressed in the liver; this finding may be predictive of the behavior of other cholesterolfree particles. These data are consistent with another study (Gueguen et al., 2024), where LNPs of five-component composition containing cationic lipid IM21.7c also got distributed into lungs and the spleen (and very little into the liver), and >95% of the reporter protein was expressed in the lungs when the LNPs were administered intravenously. The zetapotential of the LNPs containing cationic lipid IM21.7c was positive, in contrast to the previously obtained nanoparticles (Dilliard et al., 2021), which also got distributed into lungs and the spleen but had negative zeta-potential. We believe that zeta-potential has insufficient predictive value to determine a target organ. \n\nThus, the addition of a charged lipid into LNPs affects pK a of the particles, which in turn determines the formation of a protein corona on the surface of the LNPs and accordingly their subsequent distribution throughout organs, which is modulated by proteins of the corona.",

However, the limited understanding of the interaction between nanoparticles and biological entities is currently hampering the development of new systems and their applications in clinical settings. Proteins and lipids in biological fluids are known to complex with nanoparticles to form a \u201cbiomolecular corona\u201d. This has been shown to affect particles' morphology and behavior in biological systems and their interactions with cells. Hence, understanding how nanomaterials' physicochemical properties affect the formation and composition of this biocorona is a crucial step. This work evaluates existing literature on how morphology (size and shape), and surface chemistry (charge and hydrophobicity) of nanoparticles influence the formation of protein corona. The latest evidence suggest that although surface charge promotes the interaction with proteins and lipids, surface chemistry plays a leading role in determining the affinity of the nanoparticle for biomolecules and, ultimately, the composition of the corona. More recently the study of additional nanoparticles' properties like shape and surface chirality have demonstrated a significant effect on protein corona architecture, providing new tools to tailor biomolecular corona formation.

This interaction promotes the binding of LNPs to low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLr), which are highly expressed on the hepatocytes. Receptor-mediated endocytosis is a key mechanism for the internalization of LNPs by hepatocytes, partially explaining the preferential targeting of the liver by intravenously administered LNPs (Liu et al., 2023). The widespread clinical application of gene therapy has been impeded by the absence of delivery vectors capable of inducing protein expression in extrahepatic organs and tissues (LoPresti et al., 2022). Recent efforts have redirected nucleic acid delivery towards tissues beyond the liver (Kimura and Harashima, 2023). The type and proportion of helper lipids can modify the LNP structure, are essential for the stability and tissue targeting of LNPs. For instance, ester and amide bonds in lipid compounds enhance targeting to the liver and lungs, respectively. Samuel T. LoPresti et al. observed that the complete substitution of conventional helper lipids with anionic or cationic lipids led to significant and consistent transfer of lipid nanoparticles specifically to the spleen or lung, respectively (LoPresti et al., 2022). Beyond their role as delivery components, lipids may exert therapeutic effects synergistically with mRNA-encoded proteins. Multifunctional lipid materials encompass self-adjuvant lipids that enhance vaccine efficacy and paclitaxel-derived lipids enabling the combined treatment of chemotherapy and gene therapy for cancer (Hou et al., 2021;Johnson et al., 2022).",

            "text": "The adsorption of proteins on the surface of nanoparticles when they come in contact with the protein rich environment plays a vital role in deciding the fate of NPs. Several studies have described the role of protein adsorption in biological interactions [84] and have stated that \"Protein corona\" refers to the spontaneous self-assembly or biomolecular coating of the proteins on the surface of nanoparticles [85]. The formation of corona not only alters the physical properties of the nanomaterials such as size, surface charge, shape but also alerts the immune system of the body to recognize the nanoparticles as an intruder and hastens the process of opsonization [86]. Having said that, it becomes important to identify various characterization techniques to detect the extent of protein corona formation. Though several techniques such as quantitative and qualitative proteomic assays have been described to characterize the protein corona formation of the nanoparticles [87], very few studies have reported on its formation around BP nanomaterials. Here, we have discussed the techniques available to characterize the formation of protein corona around the BP nanomaterials. \n\nElectron microscopies, such as TEM, provide a clear picture of protein corona formation around the nanoparticles. For instance, in a previous study [88], the size of BPNSs was increased by 11.9 nm after being covered by plasma proteins and, in another study, the size increased by 30 nm [89]. The corona formation can also be detected by a change in surface charge. The surfaces of BPNSs coated with plasma proteins were entirely different from the native form and the charge changed to a positive value from negative. Liquid chromatography with a mass spectrometry detector was used to qualitatively analyze the compo-",

Aggregation of nanoparticles by serum proteins that we observe in TEM experiment might exacerbate this even more. However, aggregation of PF14-SCO nanoparticles in real in vivo conditions after administration is probably less extensive than in static conditions applied here due to dynamic flow and shear stress that strongly influence the structure and composition of biomolecular corona [67,68].",

[66] Blood is thicker than water -the impact of corona formation on blood system physiology As the perturbation of physiological systems by nanoparticles has recently been reviewed, 27,67,68 we here focus on novel insights into the role of the protein corona for the blood system. \n\nWhen designed for nanomedical applications, such as drug delivery or imaging, nanoparticle administration often requires intravenous injections. 2,69 Hence, detailed knowledge about the physical and chemical aspects associated with the behaviour of NPs in the complex protein-rich environment of the blood system is thus key for (re)shaping the future of nanobiomedicine. As the complete plasma proteome reference set contains more than two thousand different proteins, 70 such knowledge is particularly relevant for plasma proteins. 4,6,26,28,71 Indeed, the plasma protein corona has recently been shown to be indeed highly complex as well. 6 roteins involved in physiological as well as toxicological relevant processes in the blood system, such as to complement activation and coagulation, have been identified in the coronas of various NPs. 4,6,26,28,44,71,72 The identified proteins span about three to four orders of magnitude dynamic range, most likely covering most biologically relevant corona proteins. 6 Notably, the respective abundance of all of these proteins was affected by The early phase: a highly complex corona is established already in 30 sec, which may be composed of multiple coreshell structures ('new'). A corona of low complexity evolves slowly ('old').

            "text": "The first principle of nanoparticle delivery to tumors posits that nanoparticles will interact with biomolecules, including proteins, lipids, and ions, after in vivo administration. Nanoparticles may also stick to cells in circulation. The most well-studied nanoparticle interactions are with serum proteins. A protein corona is called the layer of serum proteins that coats the nanoparticle surface [10,11]. We also use the term biological identity to describe the overall physicochemical properties of nanoparticles in biological media because there may be additional changes in the nanoparticle properties than the surfaceadsorbed proteins [12]. For example, the nanoparticle may agglomerate into multimers. A cell sees the protein corona and unique particle morphology. \n\nNanoparticles instantaneously adsorb serum proteins after intravenous administration to form a protein corona. The corona composition can change when they travel in the bloodstream until the proteins reach an exchange equilibrium on the nanoparticle surface [13,14]. Researchers theorize that the bound serum proteins mediate the nanoparticles' cellular interactions as they travel through the bloodstream. Chithrani et al. [15] provided the first reported impact of serum protein adsorption on nanoparticles and cellular uptake. They proposed that serum proteins would affect the size-dependent uptake of gold nanoparticles in cultured HeLa cells. They showed the serum protein presence on the nanoparticles by showing a shift in the agarose gel bands of nanoparticles incubated with and without serum. Cedervall et al. [16,17] used polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to show that polystyrene nanoparticles bound many different serum proteins. They coined the term protein corona to describe the adsorbed proteins. They further described the corona as being hard or soft, referring to the strength of the nanoparticle-protein interaction. A hard corona usually has strong interactions between the nanoparticle and serum proteins, while a soft corona refers to nanoparticles that can readily adsorb and desorb from the surface. A soft corona can be called a transient protein corona.",

About 300-500 human plasma proteins could be bound to different nanoparticles. Nanomaterials are rapidly coated by proteins in physiological fluids. The formation of the protein corona leads to the change in the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles, including hydrodynamic size, surface charge, and aggregation [84]. The structure of protein corona depends primarily on the nanoparticle material, size and surface properties, as well as on the composition of protein environment and experimental/physiological conditions [84][85][86]. In addition, it contributes to the colloidal stability of the particle, that presents the aggregation of the nanoparticles and protective from aggressive environmental conditions [87,88]. Functionalization of silver nanoparticles surface significantly affects the formation dynamics of protein corona. The presence of a protein coating on the surface of the nanoparticles strongly reduces the binding degree to the protein. On the contrary, the formation of the corona on the uncoated nanoparticles improved significantly their stability in biological environment. The in vitro experiments showed that the physiological stability of AgNps caused by the corona formation may be directly associated with their binding to the cell, capture and toxicity [89]. The interaction between nanoparticles and different cells is determined by the composition of protein corona [90].",

Interestingly, when LNPs are used (made using ionizable lipid Dlin-MC3-DMA), the opposite behavior is observed.

This interest in ApoE is high, since in addition to LNPs specifically targeting the liver, a lot of LNP formulations exhibit a relatively high amount of liver accumulation in vivo. In the blood circulation and among different functions, ApoE is involved in the transportation of lipids to the liver for recycling. Recently, Sebastiani et al. [117] showed that",

To fully exploit the potential of LNPs for the delivery of nucleic acid-based therapies across various indications, a better understanding of the mechanisms by which LNPs interact with the biochemical environment they are intended to function in is necessary. \n\nThe study of proteins adsorbed to NPs during circulation, also referred to as the protein corona, has been a hot topic for many years in the drug delivery field. However, protein corona studies are very challenging, particularly when studying lipid-based NPs such as liposomes and LNPs. This is partly due to: (i) the coexistence of compositional, mass density, and size-similar endogenous NPs in blood plasma, including high-density lipoproteins (HDL), low-density lipoproteins (LDL), very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), chylomicrons, and EVs complicating selective purification of exogenous lipid-based NPs from plasma 2 ; and (ii) inherent limitations in tools used for NP characterization. These limitations are put into context below by discussing some of the key findings presented by Liu et al. \n\nTo validate that their PEG affinity-based LNP isolation method avoids contamination by lipoproteins, EVs and other plasma components, Liu et al. analyzed pull-down fractions from rat blood plasma samples which were incubated with either pegylated LNPs or pure PEGlipids (non-LNP control) with dot blots based on PEG-antibody staining (Fig. 1a) 1 . LNPs isolated from plasma from either an obese (OP) or lean (LP) rat model with the pull-down method exhibit strong PEG-antibody signals, while pull-down fractions from the non-LNP control only show faint signals.",

Ultimately, however, the discrete pathways by which tuning the physicochemical properties of formulation components directs LNPs to selectively traffic and express in certain organs and tissues require more detailed mechanistic studies to establish.\n\nThe physicochemical properties of the LNP system also impacts its interactions with serum proteins and consequent formation of a 'protein corona' which further determines particle fate in vivo . A protein corona composed of plasma opsonins, such as fibrinogen, IgG, and complement factors, for example, usually promotes rapid clearance of particles from the circulation [ 203 ]. In contrast, adsorption of plasma proteins like apolipoproteins elongate particle circulation half-lives and enhances interaction with LDL receptors, which facilitate accumulation of the particles in the liver and transportation across the blood-brain barrier [ 46 , 204 ]. Lipoproteins such as ApoE have been utilized for siRNA-LNP decoration due to their capacity to induce internalization into hepatocytes [171] , with interactions between ApoE-bound LNPs and heparan sulfate proteoglycans shown to further promote rapid uptake [205] , and albumin coating has recently been harnessed for mRNA-LNP delivery to the liver through apolipoprotein E (ApoE) independent cellular pathways [ 206 ]. Varying the proportion of charged and zwitterionic lipids at the surface of a lipid system has been reported to change the quantity and identity of the most abundant serum proteins [207] ; as such, controlling protein corona formation could present a strategy for specific targeting in vivo .\n\nLNPs may also be directly modified with a specific targeting agent in order to facilitate localization to the desired tissue or organ for more effective immunization.

As per the literature, when nanocarriers are intravenously administered, they can interact with thousands of proteins. Biological media consists of numerous active biomolecules such as lipids, nucleic acids, proteins, and blood plasma contains roughly 3,700 identified proteins (Lazarovits et al., 2015;Chen et al., 2017). Protein corona effect i.e. due to the presence of charge on nanocarriers can result into interaction with oppositely charged serum protein. Thus, nanocarriers or the targeting moiety decorated over nanocarriers get buried in protein corona resulting into prevention of nanocarriers's interaction with the targeted receptor in cancer cells (Tonigold et al., 2018). Opsonins are key proteins in the blood serum that promotes elimination of vulnerable nanocarriers by marking them off for an immune response. The major part of opsonized nanocarriers are cleared within seconds by a receptor-mediated mechanism because of the phagocytic cells in the liver, lymph nodes, and spleen of the mononuclear phagocyte system, contributing to nonspecific distribution of nanocarriers in healthy organs (Blanco et al., 2015;Chevalier et al., 2017). \n\nOne most established strategy to mitigate the effect of protein corona involves the nanocarrier functionalization with amphiphilic or hydrophilic polymers, such as poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) (Bros et al., 2018). PEG forms strong adhered hydration layer, which sterically avoid the interaction/adsorption of serum protein (Huo et al., 2019). PEG-decorated nanocarrriers reduce their recognition by the components of the mononuclear phagocytic system, increasing their blood circulation time (Xiong et al., 2009;Naeye et al., 2010).",

            "text": "Most nanoparticle-based formulations have been designed for intravenous administration to spread deeper to organ tissue without surgery. These nanovectors interact with the biological system, mainly with the circulatory proteins, upon being available into the systemic circulation. One set of proteins binds with nanoparticles' surface and forms a protein corona (PC) conjugate. After adhering, this PC makes the particles recognized by the innate immune system followed by quicker elimination by phagocytic cells present in the liver, lungs, and spleen. Additionally, these PCs increase the physical disability and agglomeration of particles. To overcome this problem, the utmost requirement is to develop new strategies to minimize PC formation with improved stability and circulatory time of nanovectors (Rampado et al., 2020). The composition and kinetics of PC vary (decrease or increase) over time. It was believed that the PCs are responsible for the instability of NPs. However, a separate study demonstrated the aggregation of nanoparticles inversely proportion with protein [human serum albumin (HSA), fibrinogen, immunoglobulin, and apolipoprotein A1 (APOA1)] concentration (Ho et al., 2018). It was observed that NPs aggregation was increased at lower protein concentrations, whereas these NPs were stable at higher protein concentrations. The interaction of the protein with the nanoparticles is varied based on the type of protein. \n\nImmunoglobulin and fibrinogens are sticky proteins either form clotting or bind with foreign bodies, whereas HAS and APOA1 interact with more NPs simultaneously to form bridges. \n\nThe concentration and tagged surfactants charged on NPs determine the PC characters (Zhang et al., 2019). Charges on NPs were changed after the formation of PC. Particles with negative charge persisted, whereas positively charged particles acquired a negative charge. Ovisprin-1 and lysozyme protein coronas were tested on plain gold nanoparticles to understand the protein corona formation in an aqueous environment (Jahan Sajib et al., 2020). It was observed that the appearance of PC is caused due to protein-protein interaction and protein's surface and hydrophobic surface effect.",

The resulting biomolecular corona might interfere with the nanoparticle-cell interaction, induce an immune response and alter the drug-release efficiency [60]. \n\nLiposomes commonly used as vectors for therapeutic molecule delivery can be unilamellar vesicles, where the hydrophilic drug molecules are loaded in the central aqueous core of the nanoparticle, or multilamellar vesicles, which can host lipophilic drugs within the lamellar structure. The majority of liposomes commercially available for drug delivery purposes are Small Unilamellar Vesicles (SUV) [61]-although they are stable during circulation, the interaction of proteins with the SUV surface provokes the formation of multilamellar structures and of liposome clusters: the change in the crystalline structure implies the rupture of the vesicles, which may result in the release of the loaded drug. \n\nThe formation of larger aggregates may impede the cellular uptake of the particles. The latter effect, however, becomes less evident as the concentration of proteins attached to the nanoparticles surface increases, possibly due to the repulsive interaction of charged proteins, as demonstrated by Caracciolo and coworkers [44]. In a recent experiment, they used a commercial formulation of liposomal Doxorubicin, a drug used for cancer treatment, to study the effect of biomolecular corona on nanoparticle stability and drug release, incubating the liposome-drug formulation in the concentration of human plasma that mimics the physiological conditions. TEM, DLS and Zeta potential experiments demonstrated the formation of biomolecular corona already at a low plasma concentration, which led to an increased particle size and to a change in the particle surface charge.",

            "text": "The greatest accumulations of NPs are found in the blood, liver, and spleen; the greater the NP, the faster it accumulates [2]. \n\nIn particular, exosomes are extracellular nanovesicles secreted by all mammalian cells either in physiological or pathological conditions; they are carriers of different biomolecules such as lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids, representing extracellular messengers through intercellular communication and process modulation [3]. \n\nIn vivo, in different conditions, NPs interact with bodily fluids so that a high level of proteins surrounds their surface and creates a complex, variable, and dynamic coating called a \"protein corona\" [4]. According to different adsorption theories, this process is energetically favorable due to a rather higher net binding energy compared to the surrounding environment, increasing the NP size by 3-35 nm and the NP surface charge to 10-20 mV [5]. The corona profile is shaped by various ambient factors, including the biomolecule concentration, pH, ionic strength, temperature, and incubation time. Once the corona forms, the nanoparticle's identity undergoes a transformation, altering its physicochemical properties, targeting capabilities, and biological responses. These changes arise from the new biological identity imparted by the adsorbed proteins \n\nThe protein corona is composed of an inner layer of tightly bound/stronger affinity proteins with a longer lifetime (\"hard corona\", HC) and an outer layer of weakly bound proteins with a shorter lifetime (\"soft corona\", SC). HCs are more easily isolated and characterized: examples of NPs with HCs include liposomes, quantum dots, metallic NPs, silica NPs, polymeric NPs, and 2D materials [5]. HCs form gradually, are more stable, and comprise \"relatively immobile\" proteins with strong affinities for NP surfaces and low tendencies to dissociate. Soft coronas, consisting of biomolecules like proteins with low affinities for NP surfaces, undergo dynamic and reversible changes influenced by the conditions of the surrounding biological fluid. Understanding both soft and hard coronas is essential for interpreting NP stability, functionality, and interactions with biological systems.",

Coverage with albumin has been shown to reduce the lysosomal degradation of nanoparticles in endothelial cells and, therefore, extend the circulation time of particles [47,71]. Furthermore, albumin facilitates transport of nanoparticles from the site of injection to peripheral tissues [60], endocytosis [72] and transcytosis across capillary endothelium [73]. In addition, other plasma proteins involved in binding, transport, and mediating availability of various biomolecules in the bloodstream (e.g., apolipoproteins, \u03b1-2-HS-glycoprotein (also known as fetuin-A), serotransferrin etc.) and proteins involved in blood coagulation and haemostasis (e.g., \u03b1-2-macroglobulin, prothrombin, fibrinogen, \u03b1-1-antitrypsin etc.) were identified in protein corona of CPP-nucleic acid nanoparticles. Moreover, contact activation pathway of coagulation can be activated by artificial negatively-charged substances, including oligonucleotides, \"naked\" pDNA and anionic nanoparticles that may explain the presence of coagulation proteins in protein corona of CPP-pDNA nanoparticles [74,75].\n\nFetuin found in the protein corona has been demonstrated earlier to trigger internalisation of nanoparticles, e.g., the uptake of nanospheres by Kupffer cells through the scavenger receptors [76].

Inherently, LNPs contain at least five additional kinds of dynamic elements that determine their potency in a bioresponsive fashion; i) a PEG-lipid that, based on short (commonly dimyristyl) lipid anchors, is sheddable upon interaction with serum proteins in blood circulation; ii) a cholesterol/phosphatidylcholine envelope that triggers the formation of an apolipoprotein E-rich surface protein corona, facilitating receptor-mediated endocytosis into liver hepatocytes via the low-density lipoprotein receptor; iii) a cationizable tertiary amine-containing lipid (Fig. 1A), which after cellular uptake into acidifying endosomes becomes positively charged and changes physical properties; iv) interaction of cationized and anionic lipids trigger membrane destabilization promoting crossing of the endosomal barrier (Fig. 1B); and v) merging nanoparticle lipids with the cellular lipid membrane lead to release of the nucleic acid payload into the cytosol to a significant extent in carrier-free, bioavailable form (32)(33)(34). Consequently, the LNP composition strongly influences protein corona formation, endogenous receptor targeting, and functional activity (35). \n\nAs multicomponent assemblies, LNPs can be improved by combinatorial variation of phospholipids, PEG-lipid, cholesterol analogs, and/or the ionizable lipid. Optimizing the cationizable lipid structure (Fig. 1A) by modifying hydrophilic head group and hydrophobic tails, optionally including degradable bonds, was key for the LNP efficacy (27,(36)(37)(38). First breakthrough was the replacement of permanent cationic lipids such as DOTMA or DOTAP by ionizable tertiary amine-containing lipids. The dynamic reversible protonation both enhances efficacy and eliminates potential toxicity problems of permanently cationic materials.",

[28] found that the 150 nm automated LNPs had higher mRNA lacking efficacy and stronger serum adsorption ability during blood circulation than the smaller ones (70 nm), highlighting the contribution of particle size to protein corona formation and excellent mRNA delivery.This underscores the role of particle size in protein corona formation and efficient mRNA delivery.These automated LNPs could facilitate cytoplasmic mRNA encoding luciferase (Luc-mRNA) delivery and mediate efficient and prolonged luciferase expression in vivo.However, there are exceptions, as suggested by Partikel's [29] study, which indicates that polymeric NPs exhibit protein adsorption independent of particle size within the 100-200 nm range.Therefore, the influence of the particle size of NADS on its protein crown adsorption is intricately related to the properties of the carrier itself.\n\nParticle size also has a significant influence on the distribution and accumulation of NADS in tumors.",

LNPs have been targeted to specific cell types or organs by physicochemical targeting, in which LNP\u2019s lipid compositions are adjusted to find mixtures with the desired tropism. In a popular approach, physicochemical targeting is accomplished by formulating with charged lipids. Negatively charged lipids localize LNPs to the spleen, and positively charged lipids to the lungs. Here we found that lung-tropic LNPs employing cationic lipids induce massive thrombosis. We demonstrate that thrombosis is induced in the lungs and other organs, and greatly exacerbated by pre-existing inflammation. This clotting is induced by a variety of formulations with cationic lipids, including LNPs and non-LNP nanoparticles. The mechanism depends on the LNPs binding to fibrinogen and inducing platelet and thrombin activation. Based on these mechanisms, we engineered multiple solutions which enable positively charged LNPs to target the lungs while not inducing thrombosis. Our findings implicate thrombosis as a major barrier that blood erects against LNPs with cationic components and illustrate how physicochemical targeting approaches must be investigated early for risks and re-engineered with a careful understanding of biological mechanisms.",

Leukosomes are liposomes with leukocyte membrane proteins, including IgG receptors, coagulation factors, and complement proteins, introduced in the liposomal lipid bilayer to obtain NPs mimicking the activity of natural leukocytes. Both types of NPs were injected into the tail vein of healthy mice; blood was withdrawn by cardiac puncture 10 min and 1 h after injection and the proteins adsorbed to the liposomes were identified by MS. Overall, leukosomes adsorbed fewer protein types than liposomes. One of those, clusterin, was exclusively found in the leukosomal corona. Interestingly, the protein corona formed in vivo increased the uptake of liposomes by immune cells but decreased the uptake of leukosomes. The authors suggested that the interaction of IgGs and other corona proteins with the receptors on the leukosomes prevented them from binding to their receptors on the macrophages. \n\nRecently, Hadjidemetriou et al. [200] presented a proof-ofconcept clinical study on in-vivo corona formation onto PEGylated liposomal NPs in humans, which had been infused intravenously into patients with recurrent ovarian carcinoma. Protein-coated liposomes were subsequently recovered from the blood, separated from blood components, and the adsorbed proteins were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed. The most abundant protein classes were Igs, lipoproteins, and complement proteins, in agreement with an earlier study on mice [197]. Moreover, more protein species were identified in the in-vivo corona than in its counterpart ex-vivo corona. Interestingly, the most abundant serum protein, albumin, was essentially absent from the in-vivo corona. Instead, low-abundance, low-molecular weight proteins were present. In a subsequent study, liposomal NPs were used as tools to fingerprint the blood proteome [201].",

            "text": "To systematically study the LNPs and their newly formed corona, the unbound proteins must be separated after their in vivo administration or in vitro incubation with blood, plasma, or serum. However, a precise characterization of the BMC of soft nanomaterials, such as LNPs has proven difficult as the size and density of LNPs are similar to \"natural\" serum nanoparticles, for instance, chylomicrons, HDL, exosomes, and many more (19). \n\nCommon separation techniques such as size exclusion chromatography (SEC) or (ultra)centrifugation are based on, respectively, size or density, and therefore they can work well for the study of bigger or dense NPs (23) but do not allow an effective separation of LNP (30 to 100 nm) from lipoproteins and related nanostructures (7 to 80 nm) present in biological media (19). In addition, as a high g-force is commonly required in (ultra)centrifugation, proteins and LNP can aggregate and induce artifacts resulting in difficulty differentiating between unbound vs. adsorbed proteins. The lack of effective and high-throughput separation techniques for soft nanomaterials has led to alternative procedures such as cross-linking proteins on the LNP surface (24,25). This effectively removes the presence of unbounded proteins but potentially disrupts the proteins present on an intact LNP surface. Furthermore, a photoaffinity lipid probe is required in the LNP formulation which can also alter the BMC formation and profile due to deviations from clinically relevant lipid compositions. In some cases, affinity assays have been used for isolating the corona of PEGylated nanomedicines (26). However, since many affinity-based assays rely on ligand binding to the polyethylene glycol (PEG) lipid, LNPs that contains diffusible PEG that are engineered to shed from the particle surface (i.e., Onpattro) may not be suitable for this method. \n\nIn this work, we demonstrate a magnetic separation (MS) technique that enables the study of LNP's BMC in a manner that is independent of their surface properties.",

The addition of an anionic lipid reduced pK a , whereas the addition of a cationic lipid increased pK a , which affected the interaction with plasma proteins and the formation of the protein corona (Dilliard et al., 2021). Results of their proteomic analysis of the protein corona suggested that targeting to the liver takes place with predominance of the ApoE protein in the protein corona; to lungs, with predominance of the \u03b22-GPI protein; and to the spleen, with predominance of the VTN protein. Incubation of these proteins with the LNPs in vitro also enabled specific LNP targeting (Dilliard et al., 2021). \n\nThose authors proposed a three-stage mechanism underlying the targeting of a five-component LNP (Dilliard et al., 2021). The first stage is the dissociation of the PEGylated lipid from the surface of LNPs; the second is the binding of SORT-lipid to blood proteins; and the third stage is the binding of proteins (adhering to the  Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org 09 particle) to tissue-specific receptors. In the case of PEG with a longer aliphatic anchor, which shows worse desorption, the expression of the reporter protein in all organs was noticeably lower, thus confirming the above mechanism. In another study (Meyer et al., 2022), LNPs containing a positively charged group of the additional lipid and a PLGA polymer also got distributed into lungs and the spleen, and the distribution was influenced by the ratio of a cationic lipid (DOTAP) to an ionizable lipid (MC3).",

            "text": "Recently, Ferreira et al. also measured R h of silica nanoparticles complexed with various plasma proteins, showing that some proteins promote particle aggregation both in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 0.137 m NaCl) and in phosphate buffer (PB; no salt), while others can induce particle aggregation in PBS but not in PB, which indicate the effect of ionic strength on particle aggregation, to an extent dependent on different proteins. [21] These experiments have revealed the effects of protein concentration and ionic strength on nanoparticle aggregation, although the mechanism has not yet been clearly understood, which requires the understanding of particle-protein and protein-protein interactions at nearly the atomic scale. \n\n[50] To understand the corona-induced aggregation, discrete simulations were performed by Li et al. [51] and Pilkington et al., [52] showing polypeptide aggregation in the presence of nanosheets, [51] lysozyme and eLact proteins. [52] Our group's coarse-grained (CG) simulations captured that the lipid-corona formation induces aggregation of 12 nm-sized spherical Au particles, depending on the lipid type and concentration. [53] Recently, Liu et al.'s allatom simulations showed that the adsorption of extracellular substances such as polysaccharides, proteins, and lipids reduces aggregation of nanoplastics because of electrostatic repulsion and steric hindrance. [54] Although these simulations have been able to explore the effects of corona components and their concentrations on peptide or particle aggregation, they have been performed using an implicit-solvent model or using an explicit-solvent model with only very limited system sizes, which are not always easy to accurately assess aggregation of multiple copies of relatively large nanoparticles bound to plasma proteins with consideration of their interactions with solvents. In particular, the aggregation extent and hydrodynamics (i.e., the change of R h ) of nanoparticles coated with different proteins and their concentrations at different ionic strengths have not so far been systematically studied through MD simulations.",

            "text": "When nanoparticles (NPs) enter a biological fluid, such as serum, proteins and peptides adsorb onto the particle's surface, forming a nanoparticle-protein corona (NPPC) complex [1][2][3]. The protein cloud develops a new surface on the nanoparticle, impacting the interactions between the nanoparticle and the surrounding environment. The NPPC complex assumes the characteristics of a core-shell particle system, where the pristine particle is the \"core\" and the corona is the \"shell\" [4]. This creates a new interface between the pristine particle and the surrounding biological fluid. The formation of a protein corona has been shown to change the particle's biological effects [5][6][7][8]. In addition to this change in the particle's characteristics, the adsorbed proteins have the potential to undergo conformational changes. Changes in either set of properties are especially important for nanomaterial drug products [9][10][11][12][13]. The cloak of proteins around particles in biological fluids has been shown to enhance or diminish a particle's specificity to a desired location, incite or inhibit its ability to permeate into a cell, and heighten or mitigate a biochemical response. When a protein corona forms, it is more likely to distribute and become available due to the nano-bio interface that forms around the surface of the nanoparticle. This protein cloud can change the biodistribution of the nanoparticle system depending on the biomolecular composition formed around the surface. Consequently, if the drug is reliant on specific proteins binding to the surface of the nanoparticle, then the particle could be translocated into an unintended location if non-targeted proteins form around the particle. \n\nResearch efforts in the field of nanotoxicology have strived to relate (or correlate) particle properties to adverse health effects. There now exists a substantial amount of published literature on this topic; however, there is no general consensus on identifying physicochemical characteristics as predictors of toxicological responses.",

            "text": "Synthetic nanoparticles and EVs in biological milieus are surrounded by layers of adsorbed biomolecules, collectively referred to as the biomolecular corona. [82] The corona dynamically changes as nanoparticles traverse between various extracellular and intracellular compartments in the body. [83] The components in the biomolecular corona impact the biological identity of EVs, including immunological recognition and clearance (Figure 5). In particular, opsonins in the blood circulation play pivotal roles in mediating nanoparticle and extracellular vesicle uptake by innate immune cells. [84] Opsonins include complement proteins, immunoglobulins, and coagulation factors. Such opsonins may also cause a cascade effect where one opsonin causes the binding of others. For example, immunoglobulins on the biomolecular corona of synthetic nanoparticles attract complement proteins. [85] Notably, proteomic analysis revealed that EVs released by metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma cells exhibit a substantial abundance of complement protein H (regulator of the alternative complement pathway). [86] Complement protein H on these EVs facilitates tumor progression and metastasis by suppressing the activation of other complement proteins, resulting in evasion of the complement system. Therefore, the addition of complement regulatory factors on the EV surface may offer a promising approach to mitigate the complement response and reduce immunological recognition and clearance, as shown for synthetic nanoparticles. [87] Furthermore, decreasing the cholesterol content of EV mimetics reduced the adsorption of complement on the surface, [88] indicating that cholesterol content may also impact the immune clearance of EVs. \n\nOther abundant components in the biomolecular corona of EVs are lipoproteins and/or their protein components (apolipoproteins). [83] Varying affinities for lipoproteins impact the interactions between EVs and cells, including immune cells. [89] Lipoproteins are considered a major contaminant of EVs due to overlapping physical characteristics, [90] and methods have been developed to reduce lipoprotein abundance following EV isolation.

            "text": "Third, regardless of the nature of the amine introduced (primary, secondary, or tertiary), these lipids were able to efficiently encapsulate mRNA. Thio-lipids may rely on more than electrostatic interactions between the positively charged ionizable headgroup and negatively charged mRNA phosphates to form LNPs with high encapsulation efficiency-\u03c0-\u03c0 and sigma hole interactions with mRNA may also be implicated in the encapsulation process (22)(23)(24)(25). The lipids that failed to quantitatively encapsulate mRNA had either steric or solubility constraints. However, not all these lipids could deliver mRNA into cytoplasm. Investigating the cpKa of the most potent lipids and experimental pKa of the LNP formulations revealed no clear correlation between lipid efficacy and ionizability. For example, lipid 20b contained only a secondary amine incorporated into the thiophene backbone structure yet was more potent than its modified counterpart. Moreover, the resulting LNPs had an unusual pH response profile, suggesting a partial positive charge across a broad pH range. We acknowledge that more work is needed to fully understand the structure-activity relationship of these lipids. \n\nOrgan-specific delivery via LNPs and nanomedicines can be achieved via either active targeting [i.e., targeting ligands (21,26,27)] or passive targeting (i.e., specific properties of the nanoparticle such as size or charge). Little is understood about the adjustments required to achieve passive targeting for specific organs; however, strong evidence suggests that the nature of the biomacromolecular corona formed on the nanoparticle surface may direct the delivery to specific organs (28)(29)(30)(31). For example, ionizable but not cationic LNPs can bind to apolipoprotein E and utilize low-density lipoprotein receptor to enter hepatic tissues (32). The LNP ionization seems to be a major determinant in the corona composition, although LNP reorganization upon exposure to serum proteins may also contribute to this phenomenon (31).",

Because loss of nanoparticles during the nebulization blocks delivering nucleic acids to the lungs via inhalation, 11 discovery of novel structural lipids that make LNPs resilient to the use of nebulizer will substantially improve efficacy of gene therapies.\n\nIn summary, these studies reinforce the potential of structural lipids to target different organs. First, the presence of structural lipids at nanoparticle surface post PEG shedding makes them an important partner for serum proteins to form a corona. The composition of the protein corona on different nanoparticles is an active area of research. 7,26 Ability to mitigate corona formation can enable LNPs to reach tissues beyond the liver. On the other hand, the surface can be designed to adsorb proteins which exploit processes that traverse impenetrable organs like the brain or propel the nanocarriers across lung endothelium. Second, the membrane lipids can play an important role in the formulation of nanoparticles based on routes of administration. For example, when delivered through inhalation, the structural lipid can impart a valuable feature to the nanocarrier, i.e., maintain its structure and ability to transfect after nebulization. Such fea-tures are necessary for developing inhalable mRNA nanoformulations for treatment of diseases like cystic fibrosis, COVID-19, asthma, or lung cancer that can be benefited by direct access to the lungs. Finally, it is unclear whether the membrane lipids directly engage with the process of endosomal escape. However, based on the differences within in vitro transfections with use of different structural lipids, one may speculate that the structural lipid perhaps contributes to LNP disassembly and resulting cytosolic delivery of RNA. The discovery of natural products that undergo conformational changes once inside an endosome can lead to potent nanocarriers for intracellular gene delivery.",

            "text": "The lion's share of various LNPs gets distributed to the liver and to a lesser extent to the spleen, and the reason is the presence of a sinusoidal discontinuous endothelium with pores of a ~100-200 nm diameter in these organs (Kumar et al., 2023). After intravenous administration and entry into the bloodstream, a protein corona forms on the surface of LNPs, and this topic is investigated in detail in Dilliard et al. (2021). The protein corona is capable of influencing the biodistribution of nanoparticles among tissues in various organs owing to the adsorption of the proteins on the tissue surface, leading to internalization via specific receptors. The best-studied mechanism of targeting of LNPs involves their uptake by hepatocytes via binding to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors on their surface (Paunovska et al., 2022). The ApoE protein present in blood plasma is a ligand of LDL receptors and binds to cholesterol on the nanoparticles' surface and ensures their predominant accumulation in liver cells (Paunovska et al., 2022;Da Silva Sanchez et al., 2022). This mechanism is confirmed by experimental data where LNPs incubated with ApoE have been found to be targeted to hepatocytes (Johnson et al., 2022); on the other hand, particles with a protein corona composed of albumin are distributed preferentially into Kupffer cells instead of hepatocytes (Johnson et al., 2022). Overall, the delivery of LNPs into cells by an ApoE-independent mechanism leads to their accumulation in cells other than hepatocytes (Wadhera et al., 2016). A decrease in the proportion of cholesterol also impairs the delivery of LNPs to hepatocytes (Kawaguchi et al., 2023). Because of the fairly widespread expression of LDL receptor in human tissues (https:// www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000130164-LDLR/tissue),",

Protein corona is a corona-like supramolecular structure formed around the surface of nanoparticles upon contact with biological fluids [23]. There are numerous types of proteins in biological fluids, which renders the composition of protein corona very complicated [24]. The formation of protein corona alters the surface chemistry of nanoparticles, i.e., change from the nanoparticulate coating layer into protein complex [25]. It is established that the surface chemistry of xenobiotics determines the cellular recognition and uptake processes [26]. Thus, protein corona will affect the cellular recognition and uptake of nanoparticles [27], and even the inflammatory [28] and cytotoxic pathways [29]. As to nanoparticles for drug delivery, premature cargo release may occur after protein corona formation [30]. The influence of protein corona can largely account for the failure of biological fate prediction. \n\nThe investigation on protein corona is necessary to interpret the biological fate of nanoparticles, and to finally promote the clinical translation. Since K. A. Dawson et al. proposed the concept of protein corona in 2007 [31], many efforts have been made in this region. The protein corona formation behaviors and mechanisms of lipid-based [32], polymeric [33], metal [34] silica [35] and other nanoparticles [36][37][38] have been comprehensively explored. With these works, relatively profound understanding of protein corona formation phenomenon is obtained. \n\nOf note, the protein corona study should be continuously paid attention to. For one thing, because of the complex physiological environment, the interaction modes between coronated nanoparticles and cells are still unclear, limiting the interpretation of the in vivo evolution of protein corona. For another thing, nanoparticles prepared from new materials are emerging rapidly, and the previously established models cannot be directly applied to the new cases.",

            "text": "Several studies have demonstrated that, indeed, the biomolecular corona itself can be recognized by cell receptors. For instance, in 2002, a study suggested that adsorption of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) from the blood to polysorbate 80coated nanoparticles was responsible for the transport of the nanoparticles across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) (Kreuter et al., 2002). Deng et al. (2011) demonstrated that negatively charged poly(acrylic acid)-conjugated gold nanoparticles adsorbed and induced unfolding of fibrinogen from human plasma, which triggered interaction with the Mac-1 receptor and resulted in the release of inflammatory cytokines. Another study also showed that ionizable lipid nanoparticles could naturally adsorb apolipoprotein-E (ApoE), leading to enhanced uptake into hepatocyte via several receptors that contain ApoE binding ligands (Akinc et al., 2010;Williams and Chen, 2010). Similarly, lipid nanoparticles made of 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium propane (DOTAP) and DNA preferentially adsorbed high amount of vitronectin from human plasma that promoted uptake into cancer cells overexpressing vitronectin receptors integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 (Caracciolo et al., 2013). Next to lipid nanoparticles, inorganic nanoparticles have also been shown to interact with distinct receptors once a biomolecular corona formed on their surface. For instance, in the presence of human serum, silica nanoparticles were shown to enter cells via interaction with the LDL receptor and/or Fc-gamma receptor I (Fc\u03b3RI) due to the abundance of LDL and immunoglobulin G (IgG) on the biomolecular corona (Lara et al., 2017;Francia et al., 2019). Not only single corona proteins, but also complex biomolecular surface layer motifs were observed to mediate cellular uptake via interaction with scavenger receptors (Lara et al., 2018).",

Therefore, developing strategies for enhancing LNPs' ability to target diverse organs is of great clinical significance. On one hand, following systemic administration, LNPs interact with specific proteins and biomolecules in the bloodstream, forming a layer of adsorbed ''protein corona'' on their surface. 25 The composition of this protein corona varies based on the type and properties of LNPs, including factors, such as composition, charge, size, surface chemistry, etc., predominantly affecting cellular uptake and biodistribution. 26 On the other hand, LNPs modified with ligands (small molecules, peptides, antibodies, etc.) are widely employed as active targeting strategies. In this section, we summarize organ-targeted LNPs developed for nucleic acid delivery and discuss specific targeting strategies, providing readers with a contemporary overview of the development of targeted LNPs.",

Conjugation of LNPs with macromolecules, such as GALA peptide (a 30 amino acid synthetic peptide with a glutamic acid-alanine-leucine-alanine repeat) [178], or antibodies, such as anti-plasmalemma vesicleassociated protein [179], has demonstrated preferential delivery of LNPs to the lungs after intravenous administration. Importantly, LNPs interact with proteins in the blood and incorporate them onto their surfaces, forming a targeting ligand coat of serum proteins called a protein corona. This protein corona can cause unexpected tissue localization of LNPs even when formulated to be organ-specific with the SORT methodology as certain host serum proteins also contribute to organ targeting. Qiu et al. demonstrated that by altering the linker structure in the lipidoid tails of SORT LNPs, the composition of the serum proteins that are incorporated into the protein corona can be manipulated to shift the LNPs towards lung-specific delivery [180].",

            "text": "LNPs are challenging to process experimentally because they have physical characteristics similar to endogenous particles in the blood and other biofluids. Size, chemical composition, density, spectral characteristics etc., all overlap with endogenous nanoparticles that are also usually much more numerous, and this complicates the analysis. Assay design also has to accommodate throughput, cost and, feasibility. \n\nIn the context of our work, we have used therapeutic LNPs containing fluorescent mRNA cargoes to ensure that we are retrieving not just PEG molecules, but also the LNP cargo as well. Using proteomics, we can detect large numbers of proteins, but markers for EVs are notably absent. Furthermore, we see different types of coronas with different LNP compositions, rather than simply pulling down the same serum components consistently as it would be in the case of systematic contamination in the isolation procedure. Finally, the composition of the quantified LNP coronas is different from the parent plasmas. One would assume that if PEGylated lipids were simply transferring to plasma components, then there would be no particular specificity and one should obtain a proteomic pattern containing components from all lipid-related endogenous particles, and this is not what we observe. \n\nWe appreciate Simsonsen's careful evaluation of our work and, we will incorporate more extensive AF4 particle characterization in future experiments. As discussed above, notwithstanding the physiological and chemical similarities among lipoproteins, EVs, and LNPs, significant distinctions persist in their physiochemical properties, origin, formation mechanisms, compositions and, subpopulation heterogeneity. Hence, the adoption of isolation methods previously tailored for disparate nanosized entities necessitates meticulous validation to prevent cross-contaminations and enhance both efficacy and throughput. Finally, with concerns addressed, our opinion is that none of the points raised by Dr. Simonsen alter our conclusions. \n\nOpen Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, which permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons licence, and indicate if changes were made.",

            "text": "It is now widely accepted that upon contact of nanoparticles with biological fluid (e.g., blood plasma) proteins rapidly adsorb to the surface forming the biomolecular corona [1,2]. On one side, this process highly affects the physico-chemical properties of the nanoparticles and on the other side; it eventually determines their biological behaviour [3][4][5]. \n\nDepending on the nanoparticle system, a direct link between cellular interaction and specific protein was proven. For example, poly(butyl cyanoacrylate) nanoparticles which were coated with apolipoprotein E were able to cross the blood-brain barrier [6,7]. Recently, for example, the dynamic interaction of a single protein (influenza A hemagglutinin) and exosomes was studied by high-speed high-speed atomic force microscopy [8]. Next to this, due to corona formation, the colloid stability and biocompatibility of inorganic Au@Fe 3 O 4 Janus particles was enhanced [9]. In strong contrast to this, several reports recognized that protein adsorption can significantly influence the targeting properties of nanoparticles [10,11]. Here, it was shown that there was no cellular recognition of transferrin-functionalized nanoparticle after corona formation, meaning that the targeting ligands is completely covered up by plasma proteins [12]. Therefore, it is of urgent need to understand and control the interaction of nanoparticles upon contact with blood proteins in order to improve their therapeutic efficiency [13]. \n\nMost in vitro studies utilize serum or plasma to investigate protein adsorption on nanoparticles [14]. Depending on the specific protein source (human vs. mice or serum vs. plasma) [15] there have been significant difference noticed in terms of cellular interaction and protein corona composition [16,17]. Therefore, it is of great importance to always use the respective plasma source of the chosen organism for in vitro studies (e.g., mouse cells = mouse plasma, human cells = human plasma). Overall, the in vitro experiments give the opportunity to characterize general interaction between nanoparticles and proteins.",

In such biological fluids, proteins and other biomolecules adhere to the surface of the NPs forming a biomolecular corona that can alter significantly the behaviour of the nanomaterials. Here, we investigate the impact of a bovine serum albumin corona on interactions between silica nanoparticles (SNPs) of two different sizes and giant lipid vesicles. The formation of the protein corona leads to a significant increase of the hydrodynamic size of the SNPs. Confocal microscopy imaging shows that the protein corona alters the morphological response of vesicles to SNPs. In addition, Laurdan spectral imaging show that the protein corona weakens the effect of SNPs on the lipid packing in the GUV membrane. Our results demonstrate that a protein corona can change the interaction mechanism between nanoparticles and lipid membranes.",

            "text": "Just as nanoparticle properties must be studied in relation to clotting, we must also investigate how changes in blood itself might affect nanoparticle-associated clotting.While these studies were done in mice, we must now assay for nanoparticle-associated clotting in human blood, as well as the large animals commonly used in preclinical efficacy and toxicity studies (pig, sheep, and non-human primates), noting that small animal models often do not capture fatal embolic side effects that emerge in larger animals and humans.We should also investigate how various disease states and medications that affect the blood might predispose or protect from nanoparticle-associated clotting.Here we showed that pre-existing inflammation worsens the magnitude of LNP-induced lung injury, but more in-depth mechanistic studies are required, as well as testing in other relevant disease states, such as common procoagulant genotypes (Factor V Leiden, Proteins C & S deficiency), cancers with clotting predispositions (noting that clotting is associated with metastasis), and other inflammatory diseases.Indeed, fibrinogen is an \"acutephase reactant,\" meaning that its concentration in plasma goes up dramatically during inflammation (and many cancers), thus making it more likely to bind to LNPs.These studies in different disease states are essential, because many of the proposed applications of LNPs are for cancer and inflammatory diseases, and thus nanoparticle-induced clotting could become more prominent and dangerous, perhaps occurring even for smaller LNPs or LNPs without positively charged lipids.\n\nFinally, more mechanistic studies are needed to further understand nanoparticle-induced clotting.Here we showed that fibrinogen binds to positively charged LNPs, and that this binding leads to downstream thrombosis steps (Fig. 4).We hypothesize that fibrinogen binding to LNPs changes its conformation to resemble its activated form.Such surface-bound fibrinogen/fibrin is known to bind to GPIIB/IIIA on platelets, immobilizing and leading to activation of the platelets.",

These findings suggest that lipid composition influences not only protein adsorption but also the physicochemical characteristics of the corona, impacting organ-specific delivery. \n\nTo further investigate protein-corona-driven targeting, we analyzed the top 30 most abundant proteins in lung-and spleen-targeting LNP coronas (Tables S5-S10). Additionally, to provide a clearer interpretation of the results, we focused on proteins that were highly enriched in one organ-specific LNP corona while being absent or barely detected in the other (Figure 4E,F). Results showed that the predominant proteins absorbed in spleentargeting LNPs are actin, myosin, and the immunoglobulin lambda-like protein. These proteins exhibit a low correlation and are typically nonspecific and are often found in negative mass spectrometry controls. Therefore, the mechanism underlying spleen targeting remains unclear. However, the protein-corona composition of lung-targeting LNPs was clearly distinct from that of liver-and spleen-targeting LNPs. Notably, vitronectin and prothrombin, both extensively reported as key protein-corona components influencing lung targeting, were among the most enriched proteins [12,13,27]. These findings suggest that lung-targeting LNPs in our ionizable lipid library follow previously described mechanisms of proteincorona-mediated lung selectivity.",

            "text": "Currently, the design of anticancer therapeutics is focused on creating new systems with low toxicity, e.g., those based on nanocarriers, enabling targeted delivery and high efficiency of the treatment [1]. Usually, it is assumed that immediately after being introduced into the blood, nanoparticles (NPs) are surrounded by plasma proteins that form a biological coating around the individual NPs, known as the protein corona [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10]. Various characteristics of NPs (their size and shape, surface properties, etc.) have an influence on a formation mechanism of the protein corona [5,7]. In this respect, two categories of proteins can be distinguished: opsonins, which can increase the recognition of the reticuloendothelial system and, as a result, lead to a rapid elimination from the organism, and dysopsonins, which can improve the blood circulation time of NPs [9][10][11]. Therefore, when creating targeted drug delivery systems (DDS), knowledge about the protein-NP interaction mechanism can be crucial. \n\nUp until now, the formation of a protein corona was described for NPs based on polystyrene, gold, silica, and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), and was frequently used for masking other NPs [3,4,6,12]. Another way to increase the lifetime of NPs in the bloodstream is to create a particle with \"stealth\" properties. The \"stealth\" effect can be described as a phenomenon of preventing the adsorption of proteins onto NPs. It allows for prolonging blood clearance and reduces non-specific cellular uptake [2][3][4]. \n\nThe presence of strong or weak interactions between nanoparticles and proteins determines the possibility of the occurrence and the mechanism of the corona formation. The presence of a corona is an important factor in determining the effectiveness of a nanoparticle as a drug carrier [13].",

            "text": "When nanoparticles are presented to a physiological environment such as human plasma they selectively absorb biomolecules to form a so-called biomolecular corona on the surface of the nanoparticle [9]. Needless to say, one should be aware of the fact that nanoparticles -indeed, any material surfaces -may be coated with bacterial endotoxin or lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a membrane component of all Gram-negative bacteria, especially if the nanoparticles are synthesised under non-sterile conditions. This could give rise to interference with the biological assessment of nanomaterials eg. induction of maturation of dendritic cells (DC) [10]. However, of more importance for the present discussion, several studies in recent years have provided evidence for a \"hard\" (long-lived) corona of human plasma proteins on nanoparticles of different chemical composition [11][12][13][14]; the formation of the hard corona was shown to depend on both size and surface properties eg. degree of hydrophobicity [15]. The bio-corona has been reported to impact on cellular uptake [16] and on cell signaling including NF-\u043aB-dependent cytokine production in THP.1 cells [17]. Notably, lipids, not only proteins, may also feature prominently in the bio-corona, as shown recently for single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) administered into the lungs of mice [18], and the combined lipid-protein corona may play a role in cellular uptake of nanomaterials. The notion that naked particle surfaces may not exist in nature has profound implications as the bio-corona may convey a new biological \"identity\" to nanoparticles [19]. This is, in a manner of speaking, a case of the Emperor\u00b4s new clothes in reverse; hence, the Emperor is not naked as we thought but fully \"clothed\" in a layer of biomolecules. In fact, some studies have even provided detailed information on the thickness of this layer, using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy [20].",

[48] The adsorption affinity of these plasma proteins to LLC nanoparticles (i.e., the protein corona effects) is somewhat dependent on the choice of steric stabilizers and the lipid phases formed. For a system based on MO/medium-chain triglyceride (MCT), Wibroe et al. compared the stabilization effect against serum using the anionic surfactant citrem and the nonionic amphiphilic polymer Plu-F127. [49] Similar to that observed in cell culture media, [44] a short incubation in human serum (for 4 h at 37 \u00b0C) slightly increased the lattice parameter (a) and median diameter (d) of the binary dispersions stabilized by Plu-F127 (LD F127 ) and that by citrem (LD citrem ) (Figure 3a). [49] t was clearly shown that the L 2 phase (LD citrem3.0 ) is more sensitive to the protein corona effects (with \u224820% size increment) than the corresponding H 2 phase (LD citrem1.5 , \u22485% increase). As speculated by the authors, this is possibly due to more efficient trapping of the serum proteins in the L 2 \"swollen\" micellar aqueous cores in comparison with that of the H 2 cylindrical nanochannels. 52][53] On the other hand, the chemical structure of PHY does not possess an ester group, and it is therefore considered \"nondigestible\" from an esterase perspective, precluding an impact of chemical changes on self-assembled structure when this PHY particle system is exposed to plasma.",

            "text": "Using super-resolution optical microscopy (STORM), Feiner-Gracia et al. (2017) were able to visualize the protein corona formed on mesoporous silica nanoparticles with single protein sensitivity and found a significant heterogeneity in protein absorption within the same nanoparticle population. Moreover, the authors demonstrated that changes in the corona composition occurred over time due to the chemistry and degradability of the particles, thus adding a further level of complexity to our understanding of the biological identity of nanomaterials (Feiner-Gracia et al., 2017). \n\nThe second, non-technical (and non-trivial) question refers to the biological \"meaning,\" if any, of all these proteins. It is well understood that the presence or absence of proteins, regardless of their identity, may influence the degree of agglomeration of nanoparticles. The question is whether there is a role for specific proteins in the bio-corona? Tenzer et al. (2013) performed comprehensive studies using a panel of PS nanoparticles and silica nanoparticles of various sizes displaying different surface charges and could show that the rapid formation of a plasma protein corona could modulate distinct pathophysiological effects as evidenced by the ex vivo analysis of platelet activation/aggregation and red blood cell lysis (i.e., hemolysis). However, the complexity of the protein corona precluded the assignment of specific proteins to account for these effects (and perhaps the effects were related to a shielding of the particle surface, thereby passivating the nanoparticles) (see, e.g., Hu et al., 2011, Lesniak et al., 2012). Indeed, we have shown that the cytotoxicity of silica nanoparticles is mitigated in the presence of serum whereas ZnO nanoparticles that undergo rapid dissolution are cytotoxic both in the absence and presence of serum (Shi et al., 2012).",

            "title": "Effect of PEG Anchor and Serum on Lipid Nanoparticles: Development of a Nanoparticles Tracking Method",
            "text": "Recently, the transfection of HepG2 cells with LNPs also showed the impact of C18 lipid-PEG in serum-containing medium. It was observed that the addition of FBS could decrease the transfection efficacy of C18 LNPs while increasing the efficacy of C14 LNPs. The authors discussed these results, suggesting that the protein corona could either hinder the uptake process or facilitate it due to other receptor-mediated phenomenon [4]. Even if the protein corona has been described to inhibit transfection, it now appears that some of the proteins included in this corona could specifically interact with cellular processes and particles trafficking [2]. Regarding the results obtained in this study, it could then be hypothesized that C14 lipids-PEG dissociate in serum, which can facilitate transfection, as PEG is known to prevent the cellular uptake and endosomal escape processes [6]. Following this desorption, PEG could be replaced by a protein corona, which could also play a positive role on transfection, depending on its composition. In contrast, C18 lipids-PEG have strong anchoring ability which allows for the prevention of protein corona formation, but could also be an obstacle to transfection. Moreover, as explained by Chen et al., PEG cannot completely eliminate the binding of proteins around LNPs, and that proteins could impact the transfection in serum. \n\nSeveral parameters must then be considered when designing LNPs. The use of long lipids-PEG can offer an efficient protection against protein corona formation, prolong the circulation of LNPs, and increase the accumulation in tumor. Nevertheless, the transfection efficacy of these LNPs could finally be lower than expected because of the barrier effect of PEG. However, this effect could be balanced by an intermediate proportion of C18 lipid-PEG in LNPs formulations if an equilibrium between efficient stealth properties and efficient transfection can be found. On the other hand, recent examples highlighted the interest in using short lipids-PEG in order to avoid long effect or to target hepatic diseases. In that case, the formation of the protein corona is intended, and recent studies demonstrated the high transfection efficacy of these LNPs.",

            "text": "Many experimental techniques have been used to investigate the binding of proteins to nanoparticles and some models have been proposed to rationalize the experiments [10,32]. The most accepted view on protein corona formation is that proteins that adsorb with high affinity form a \"hard\" corona, do not readily desorb and show larger exchange times in the order of several hours. The \"soft\" corona is formed by proteins that adsorb with low affinity, are loosely bound, and are in permanent exchange with other proteins [9,28]. However, the mechanisms of protein corona formation are still debated and no existing model can fully explain it [6,10,29]. Comparing different NPs in blood plasma, it has been shown experimentally that the physicochemical properties of a given nanoparticle determine also their individual \"adsorbome\" [10]. \n\nIn the present study we used polymer-coated monodisperse SPIOs (11 nm core, total hydrodynamic diameter about 25 nm), as well as PEGylated variants as model nanoparticles. The iron oxide cores were labelled with 59 Fe and we used an iodination kit to label also transferrin or albumin with 125 I to trace the exchange of corona proteins in vitro and also in vivo in mice. These two proteins are of physiological relevance with albumin as the most abundant plasma protein and transferrin with a well understood function in iron transport and already widely used in transferrin-conjugated nanoparticles [20,21,23]. As shown in a recent metaanalysis of adsorbed corona proteins from 63 different nanoparticles in 26 studies, our chosen test proteins were also among the group of adsorbed plasma proteins which show a high abundance (>10%) in coronas from many NPs [10]. \n\nMost of the results on the composition, structure, and binding kinetics of the protein corona were so far performed ex situ and required the adequate isolation of the NPs from an artificial or physiological environment for example by differential centrifugation (DC) of size exclusion chromatography (SEC) [30,31]. \n\nThese techniques are easy to perform and allow the use of modern measuring technology to analyze parameters of the protein corona.",

            "text": "This makes particle collisions, which are required to induce aggregation processes following second order kinetics [109], less likely and colloidal stability will increase upon dilution. Based on the above mentioned three determining factors it may be concluded that ligand-free colloids may only be used as primary particles in biological assays when they are highly diluted, while at higher concentrations mainly aggregates have to be considered. However, the fate of nanoparticles in biological fluids is not only dictated by electrostatic effects. Nanoparticles are known to spontaneously react with organic medium components, predominantly serum proteins, which rapidly (<0.5 min) form a stable protein corona on the nanoparticles [110], known to stabilize the particles against aggregation by sterical effects [111]. The mechanism of protein corona formation is still under vivid debate, though it is generally believed that proteins with high affinities strongly bind to the nanoparticle surface forming a hard corona, while other proteins more loosely bound form a soft corona. The corona is reported to be highly dynamic. Depending on the medium more abundant proteins are quickly adsorbed but gradually replaced by proteins with higher affinity [112,113]. However, more recent studies involving the timeresolved screening of 300 blood proteins by proteomics seems to indicate that the time resolved changes in the composition of the corona are not that pronounced [110]. However, proteinnanoparticle interactions for totally ligand-free nanoparticles have not been extensively studied [68], though it is reported that protein deformation is more likely to occur on bare nanoparticle surfaces [111]. In order to examine the influence of protein stabilization on ligand-free nanoparticles, albumin may be an appropriate model substance, which is known to be abundant in the protein corona and is one of the most frequent proteins in serum-containing cell culture media [114]. It was recently shown that ligand-free laser-fabricated gold nanoparticles could be successfully stabilized by albumin [81]. Additionally, the required albumin concentration is dependent on the ionic strength of the medium (Figure 8A), most likely caused by the interplay between two opposing forces, namely steric stabilization by albumin and destabilization by screening of surface charges at higher salinities.",

There is a consensus that the outer surface of nanomaterials within biological systems is essentially covered by a protein corona as a result of non-specific adsorption and protein interactions. Furthermore, cellular and tissue responses of the nanomaterials depend on these corona compositions, which in turn have been demonstrated to be influenced by parameters such as size, shape, temperature, pH, surface charge, surface functional groups, and hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity of the nanoparticles (Gossmann et al., 2015;Yallapu et al., 2015). Even protein corona repellant membrane-wrapped nanoparticles have resulted in a non-specific protein adsorption (corona formation). However, selective cellular uptake of these nanoparticles has been observed in antigen presenting cells (Xu et al., 2016). Furthermore, the adsorption and unfolding of a single bovine serum albumin protein was found to trigger nanoparticle aggregation (Dominguez-Medina et al., 2016). Therefore, protein adsorption and associated conformation changes can play a major role in determining nanoparticle stability.",

And last but not the least, incorporation of imaging agents, together with the drug, offers the option of a theranostic approach, that is, it opens opportunities for treatment and target imaging at the same time [61\u2022].\n\nHowever, a key problem for many types of nanoparticles is the formation of a corona [62]. Corona formation involves the opsonization of a nanoparticle with plasma components. All kind of plasma proteins and lipids can accumulate into the lipid bilayer of a liposome or may get non-covalently attached to silica, gold, or other inert inorganic particles [63]. Recent studies have shown that many different plasma proteins and lipids are more or less selectively opsonized by a nanoparticle, leading to an enrichment of certain proteins in the corona during their circulation time [63]. This opsonization greatly affects their body distribution: it can lead to enhanced uptake in non-target cells such as the opsonization of complement factor C3 into liposomes, leading to uptake in macrophages [64], whereas the binding of apo-lipoproteins shifts the uptake of nanoparticles to hepatocytes [15]. This corona formation can thus disrupt all cell-selective targeting strategies. Current research activities focus on the prevention of corona formation, e.g., by the coupling of PEG molecules to the liposomes or other nanoparticles [65], although this may lead to other problems such as the accelerated blood clearance phenomenon (see above). Fundamental knowledge on processes that affect corona formation is lacking, but it is becoming clear that physio-chemical properties of the particle itself are an important factor [62,66]. The composition of plasma is also of great importance [66] and obviously this changes during disease, making it even more complicated. It is also becoming clear that the composition of the corona may affect the intracellular routing of nanoparticles within cells [66]. Nanoparticles can be internalized and degraded within the cell via clathrin-or caveolin-dependent pathways or other",

The chemical nature of the protein corona determines the biological identity of the nanoparticle and influences, among others, the recognition of the nanocarrier by the mononuclear phagocytic system and, thus, its clearance from the blood. Recent works suggest that Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR), extensively employed for the analysis of biomolecular interactions, can shed light on the formation of the protein corona and its interaction with the surroundings. The synthesis and characterization of solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) coated with polymers of different chemical nature (e.g., polyvinyl alcohol, chitosans) are reported. The proof-of-concept for the use of SPR technique in characterizing protein-nanoparticle interactions of surface-immobilized proteins (immunoglobulin G and bovine serum albumin, both involved in the formation of the corona) subjected to flowing SLN is demonstrated for non-chitosan-coated nanoparticles. All assayed nanosystems show more preference for IgG than for BSA, such preference being more pronounced in the case of polyvinyl-alcohol-coated SLN.",

Nanosized carriers of very diverse composition are being actively investigated, including metallic, polymeric, ceramic, and lipidic nanoparticles and also hybrid systems by combining such materials [4,5]. \n\nOne of the main limitations of these kinds of delivery systems is their short circulation time due to the opsonization phenomenon and subsequent uptake by the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS). After exposure of nanocarriers to biological fluids, biomolecules are rapidly adsorbed onto their surface forming the protein corona. The corona composition determines the biological identity of the nanoparticle and influences its toxicity, biological fate, circulation time, cell uptake, and drug release kinetics [6,7]. At first, the protein corona includes considerable amounts of low-affinity proteins which abound in the biological medium. Over time, the composition of the corona is enriched with high affinity proteins [7]. Interestingly, some of the adsorbed proteins are opsonins which promote the uptake and degradation of the nanoparticles by the cells of the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS) (mainly located in the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes). Among the proteins commonly found in the corona, IgG and proteins involved in the complement pathway typically act as opsonins (promoting uptake by MPS) whereas serum albumin and apolipoproteins enhance circulation time [8]. The clearance of the nanoparticles by the MPS reduces the bioavailability of the encapsulated drug [9,10]. A considerable amount of evidence, however, indicates that this phenomenon can be reduced by coating the nanoparticles with different polymeric substances [11][12][13]. \n\nLipid-based nanosystems stand out because of their nontoxic, biocompatible and environmentally friendly composition.",

The characteristics of these proteins, which are one of the substantial factors in cellular response, are affected by the interactions between the nanomaterials and the biological systems. Many studies have investigated the biological behaviors of nanomaterials by conducting experiments in vitro and in vivo; however, the origin of the biological materials used is rather inconsistent. This is due to the fact that the composition of the protein coronas may differ depending on the animal origin, not on the composition or size of the nanoparticles. The resulting differences in the composition of the protein coronas can lead to different conclusions. To identify the differences in protein corona formation among sera of different species, we investigated protein coronas of gold and silica nanoparticles in serum obtained from various species. Using comparative proteomic analysis, common proteins adsorbed onto each nanoparticle among the three different sera were identified as highly abundant proteins in the serum. These findings indicate that protein corona formation is dependent on the serum population rather than the size or type of the nanoparticles. Additionally, in the physiological classification of protein coronas, human serum (HS) was found to be rich in apolipoproteins. In conclusion, our data indicate that HS components are different from those of bovine or mouse, indicating that the serum species origin should be carefully considered when selecting a biological fluid.",

            "text": "Adsorption of blood proteins to the surface of nanocarriers is known to be the critical factor influencing cellular interactions and eventually determining the successful application of nanocarriers as drug carriers in vivo. There is an increasing number of reports summarizing large data sets of all identified corona proteins. However, to date our knowledge about the multiple mechanisms mediating interactions between proteins and nanocarriers is still limited. In this study, we investigate the influence of protein structure on the adsorption process and focus on the effect of heat inactivation of serum and plasma, which is a common cell culture procedure used to inactivate the complement system. As in general routine lab procedure, heat inactivation was performed at 56 \u00b0C for 30 min in order to denature heat labile proteins. When nanocarriers were exposed to native versus heat inactivated serum, we saw that the cellular uptake by macrophages was significantly affected. These results were then correlated with an altered corona composition that depended on the treatment of the protein source. In summary, we were able to prove that the protein structure is one of the key parameters determining protein corona formation.",

            "text": "When nanosystems are in a physiological environment, they rapidly adsorb biomolecules such as proteins and lipids onto their surface, forming a biomolecular \"corona\" (Fig. 6), an interface organization that may be loosely divided into two components termed the \"hard\" and \"soft\" coronas, with (respectively) \"long\" and \"short\" typical exchange times.The corona will change composition if the nanoparticle moves to another compartment or fluid.Tenzer et al. found that the corona formed rapidly after the particles had been mixed with plasma and it could be detected even at the first measurement point (at 30 s) [216].This corona surrounding the particle changes its original surface charge and chemistry, size, solubility, aggregation and, hence, it changes the dialogue of nanoparticles with the cells, influencing the trafficking, in vivo biodistribution and cellular uptake because these proteins adsorbed onto the sur-face interact with cells through receptors on cell plasma membrane [217].The protein corona influences macrophage capture since proteins involved in the process of opsonization (opsonins) can be adsorbed onto the nanoparticle surface.Macrophage scavenger receptors are a broad group of phagocytic receptors that are responsible for the elimination of blood-borne viruses, pathogens, and negatively charged ligands.For ex-ample, opsonins such as IgG, complement factors, and fi-brinogen promote the phagocytosis, removal of nanoparticles from the bloodstream and concentration in the liver and spleen, while dyopsonins such as albumin and apolipoprotein help the longer circulation of nanoparticles in the body [94].Human serum albumin, when adsorbed onto the surface of polystyrene microparticles, was reported to inhibit their phagocytosis by dendritic cells [218].\n\nFor many NPs, while removal from the bloodstream is a question of minutes, interaction with cells of distant organs may be relevant hours or days after exposure.",

            "text": "The most established form of nanodelivery agents are lipidbased (Langer and Folkman, 1976;Adams et al., 2017). Lipid-based nanoparticles (LNPs) have been approved by the FDA for delivery of siRNA to the liver and for mRNA vaccine delivery (Paunovska et al., 2022). LNPs are based on structures that can be formed by phospholipids in aqueous solutions, such as micelles and liposomes (Paunovska et al., 2022). Traditional LNPs contain multiple lipids, including cationic lipids, amphipathic phospholipids, and poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG), as well as cholesterol (Semple et al., 2010;Cheng et al., 2015;Paunovska et al., 2022). Variations of these components can be used to direct LNP uptake to specific vascular beds (Paunovska et al., 2018). LNPs can be used to deliver a range of RNA payloads from siRNA to mRNA (Musunuru et al., 2021;Rothgangl et al., 2021). Because systemic delivery of RNA often leads to accumulation in the liver (Li et al., 2020), various strategies have been developed to target other organs, including the lung. One strategy has been to covalently conjugate an antibody that binds plasmalemma vesicleassociated protein (PV1) to LNPs. This strategy can increase the protein expression of mRNA delivered via these antibodyconjugated LNPs by 40-fold in the lung (Li et al., 2020). Nanoparticle size is an important factor in lung localization, with 160 nm conjugated LNPs leading to greater protein expression in the lungs compared to smaller 70 nm particles (Anselmo et al., 2015;Li et al., 2020).",

Biological media, such as blood plasma, are incredibly complex and contain over 3,700 identified proteins, leading to a highly competitive environment for the formation of the corona. This phenomenon, known as the Vroman effect, highlights the dynamic nature of protein adsorption, where proteins with higher mobility and lower affinity initially occupy the NP surface, only to be replaced by proteins with higher affinity over time. \n\nIn addition to proteins, several other molecules in whole blood can contribute to the formation of the NP corona [36], including lipids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, metabolites, complement factors, and antibodies [62]. For example, lipids such as cholesterol and phospholipids, glycans-which are carbohydrate molecules that play a role in cell recognition and signaling-or small metabolites like glucose, hormones, and vitamins can adsorb onto NPs, altering their surface properties and influencing their interactions with cells [61]. \n\nOn the other hand, circulating DNA is present in the blood of all individuals [67], and its concentration increases in cancer patients [28]. Furthermore, depending on the state of different diseases, blood plasma also contains a variety of RNA types, including mRNAs, noncoding RNAs, and fragments of rRNAs, snoRNAs, and miRNAs [54,58], suggesting that the NP-corona composition also depends on the health condition of the host. Moreover, complement factors that are part of the immune system and immunoglobulins or antibodies, which are glycoproteins produced by plasma cells, can mark the NP for clearance by immune cells [61]. Therefore, it will be critical in the future to understand how all these components collectively form the biomolecular hard and soft corona, which significantly impacts the biological identity and fate of NPs in the body [62].",

            "text": "When NPs enter biological fluids, e.g., the blood after systemic administration or the cytosol after cell uptake, they are coated by biomolecules, in particular proteins, which adsorb onto their surface [7,8].The new layer, or corona, confers to NPs properties which might be very different from those of the bare NPs, markedly affecting their behaviour with regards to pharmacokinetics (biodistribution, interaction with immune system and clearance) and pharmacodynamics (interaction with cells and putative biological targets) [6,7].\n\nThe formation and composition of protein corona is a complex process depending on the physicochemical properties of NPs (e.g., size, composition and charge) [5,30,[35][36][37] and on the biological fluid (protein's abundance and affinity for NPs surface) [7,35,38].The protein adsorption is also a dynamic and competitive process, where more abundant proteins might adsorb at first, even with weak bonds, being displaced thereafter by less abundant proteins with higher affinity for the NPs surface [30,39,40].For example, experimental data [41] and the results of a simulation model [40] suggest that human serum albumin (HSA) forms the early corona, and is soon replaced by higher-affinity and slower-exchanging apolipoproteins.The labile corona formed at initial time points is usually indicated as the \"soft corona\" and is characterized by a fast exchange rate with free proteins all around, whereas the latter is indicated as \"hard corona\" and is due to a more stable layer of proteins.Proteins adsorbed after incubation of NPs in plasma can be identified by proteomic analysis, and previous studies [5,8,36] indicated that the hard corona is mainly composed by 10-50 proteins including HSA, specific lipoproteins and proteins involved in coagulation and the complement pathway, with different consequences relevant to nanomedicine and nanosafety.",

            "text": "Upon entering the blood stream, nanoparticles rapidly absorb serum proteins on their surface. The effects of protein corona heavily control the biodistribution of nanoparticles. For some LNPs, ApoE adsorption is essential for the cellular uptake of LNPs. Akinc et al. (15) have described the role of ApoE in the in vivo uptake of LNPs by hepatocytes. They compared the uptake of LNPs by hepatocytes in wild-type and ApoE knockout mice. The activity of LNPs was remarkably reduced in ApoE knockout (ApoE \u2212/\u2212 ) mice compared to wild-type mice. Since the major cell population in the liver is hepatocytes and they overexpress LDLR, an alternative targeting ligand is necessary for LSEC-specific delivery of RNA other than the ApoE. Previously, specific targeting ligands were evaluated for enhancing the selective delivery of LNPs to target cells (15). Kumar et al. (36) showed decreased activity of LNPs with higher PEG-lipid content in hepatocytes due to reduced association of ApoE with LNPs. They showed that LNPs with 5% PEG-lipid have a lower binding affinity with ApoE compared to LNPs with 1.5% PEG-lipid. By introducing unique targeting ligands to the highly PEGylated LNPs, ApoE-mediated cellular uptake can be blocked and selective delivery of LNPs can be achieved. \n\nAmong various liver cells, LSECs are substantial targets for RNA therapeutics because LSECs are closely related to fetal liver diseases resulting from LSECs-derived gene products (17,19). To achieve the selective delivery of LNPs to LSECs, we introduced LSEC-specific ligands to highly PEGylated LNPs. Mannose receptor is one of the receptors that specifically expressed on human and mice LSECs (17). Mannose-conjugated nanoparticles have been investigated in various targeted delivery studies, and these nanoparticles have been proven to be safe (37,38).",

            "text": "Consequently, the complement activation is strictly dependent on the biomolecules that immediately adsorb on the NP's surface, i.e., the biomolecular corona (BC), as will be further discussed in the following sections. As a fundamental step towards tuning the immune system by BC, the nanotechnologist will carefully understand factors regulating the bionano interactions, i.e., the interaction between NPs and biomolecules leading to BC formation. 40 e biomolecular corona of nanoparticles Upon exposure to biological media abundant and high exchange rate proteins rapidly cover the particle surface which results in the formation of a fast-evolving \"so\ue09d\" BC made of loosely bound proteins. 41 Over time high-affinity proteins with a very slow exchange rate undermine the so\ue09d BC and form a long-standing \"hard\" BC around NPs. 42 Typically, most studies focused on the characterization of the hard corona as the characterization of the so\ue09d corona is affected by experimental biases arising from the lack of precise protocols for its isolation. For this reason, many open-ended questions have long remained elusive including if the so\ue09d corona is different in composition from its hard counterpart, and whether proteins enriching the so\ue09d BC trigger nanoparticle-cellular interactions. Recently, it has been demonstrated that only a minor fraction of proteins is unique to so\ue09d BC, while the largest fraction is also present in the hard BC, showing that the same proteins can interact strongly or weakly with nanoparticles or pre-adsorbed neighboring proteins. \n\n9][50] Among them, the protein source (e.g., human vs. mouse serum) is surely the factor contributing most to the enrichment of the biomolecular corona with immunogenic proteins (e.g., immunoglobulins, complement proteins). For instance, Caracciolo et al. demonstrated that two different formulations of cationic liposomes were more enriched in immunogenic proteins following exposure to human plasma (HP) than they were a\ue09der exposure to mouse plasma (MP). 51",

            "text": "The corona detected for the 76 nm sample in the whole blood samples resembled apolipoprotein A-I with aprominent band, rather than the 9.5 nm sample. In serum, the detected corona was in a changeover from 9.5 to the 76 nm NPs i.e., the quantity of apolipoprotein A-I reduced with the increase in NP size due to the change in size or curvature of the NPs [33]. Besides the particle size, the PC detected around the NPs also depended upon parameters such as the composition of the biological medium, and the fraction of the particle surface area in direct contact with the biological medium. \n\nIf the surface area of the NPs is large i.e., if a large number of particles are present in a given area, a low affinity protein may bind and stabilize the interaction with the aggregates of NPs. The exposed surface area may also reflect the protein-compelled NP aggregation. The trapped protein in the complex can be analyzed after its release from the NP-protein corona complex although it is not a part of corona composition. The large surface area aggregates of the corona with diversified proteins have been explained in previous work [34,35]. \n\nWalczyk et al. conducted a study on several normal nanoparticles dispersed in blood plasma to investigate the formation and categorization of (hard or soft) PC assembly and their longevity. Herein, the authors used carboxylated polystyrene particles (PSCOOH), sulfonated polystyrene particles of sizes 100 and 200 nm, and silica particles of size 50 nm incubated in normal plasma. The results are shown in Figure 4a-f. In Figure 4a, it can be seenall the changes in the peaks during incubation were reproducible. Figure 4b shows that the protein complex monomer and the bigger protein-particle complexes were retained with unaltered sizes as in the plasma in situ. Figure 4c,d indicates that the particles werepolydisperse in nature, and that protein conformation is affected by the method of sample preparation. Moreover, the size of corona particle was observed to be 5 nm larger than the bare nanoparticle (Figure 4e).",

            "text": "Conventional PEG lipids, such as distearoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (DSPE)-PEG2000, are known to remain firmly linked to LNPs and prohibit the release of the nucleic acid. Then, utilization of specific PEG lipids that possess short acyl chains (like ceramide-PEG lipids) may be advantageous to achieving high transfection efficiency because of their ability to gradually diffuse out of the LNPs, leading to the formation of destabilized LNPs that consequently release their nucleic acid contents [91,95]. \n\nThe formation of a bimolecular corona complex may change the surface properties of LNPs, and these changes can be adopted to enhance and/or target delivery of the loaded content [90,96]. It is well-documented that the type and quantity of the individual proteins employed in the formation of bimolecular corona will be determined by the intrinsic properties of nanoparticles as well as their biological activity [90]. LNPs are known to interact with blood proteins (opsonins), such as immunoglobulins (IgG and IgM), fibronectin, and a number of complement proteins. These interactions will facilitate recognition and uptake of nanoparticles by the phagocytic cells and, consequently, promote their elimination [97]. PEGylation of LNPs may diminish the recognition of nanoparticles and their rapid removal by phagocytic cells. It was reported that the inclusion of PEGylated lipids lowers the tendency of nanoparticles to adsorb complement proteins and immunoglobulins and, hence, allow nanoparticles to escape the macrophage system [94]. However, accelerated removal of PEGylated nanoparticles and stronger activation of complement interactions can be encountered upon infusion of these PEGylated nanoparticles in patients having anti-PEG antibodies [94,98].",

Nanoparticles will rapidly adsorb proteins forming what is known as the protein \"corona\" after enters the circulation system. The structure and composition of the protein corona depends on the synthetic identity of the nanomaterial, this would in uence the biological identity of nanoparticles [28] . The physiological functions of various proteins that comprise the protein corona generally involve lipid transport, coagulation, complement activation, pathogen recognition, or ion transport [29] . Understanding nanoparticle-protein interactions is a crucial issue in the development of targeted nanomaterial delivery in vivo [30] . The physiological environment to which nanoparticles are rst exposed after intravenous administration is the blood stream, and the cell-free portion of the blood (plasma) contains more than 1000 proteins. These proteins potentially interact with nanoparticles to exert different physiological functions, such as recognition by macrophages, causing in ammatory reactions, thrombosis and allergic reactions [31] . \n\nThe safety issues of biomaterials with exceptional biocompatibility and hemo-compatibility have also received extensive attention at the nanoscale. Numerous nanomaterials have been widely used as drug delivery systems and diagnostic contrast agents in treating cardiovascular diseases. This article focuses on polymer nanoparticles and explores their bioactivity impact on the development of AS and physiochemical mechanisms. Therefore, we conducted a study of the effects of poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles, which are widely used in a variety of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved therapeutic devices, on the development of aortic atherosclerotic plaques in ApoE \u2212/\u2212 mice.",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have emerged as potent carriers for mRNA delivery, but several challenges remain before this approach can offer broad clinical translation of mRNA therapeutics. To improve their efficacy, a better understanding is required regarding how LNPs are trapped and processed at the anionic endosomal membrane prior to mRNA release. We used surface-sensitive fluorescence microscopy with single LNP resolution to investigate the pH dependency of the binding kinetics of ionizable lipid-containing LNPs to a supported endosomal model membrane. A sharp increase of LNP binding was observed when the pH was lowered from 6 to 5, accompanied by stepwise large-scale LNP disintegration. For LNPs preincubated in serum, protein corona formation shifted the onset of LNP binding and subsequent disintegration to lower pH, an effect that was less pronounced for lipoprotein-depleted serum. The LNP binding to the endosomal membrane mimic was observed to eventually become severely limited by suppression of the driving force for the formation of multivalent bonds during LNP attachment or, more specifically, by charge neutralization of anionic lipids in the model membrane due to their association with cationic lipids from earlier attached LNPs upon their disintegration. Cell uptake experiments demonstrated marginal differences in LNP uptake in untreated and lipoprotein-depleted serum, whereas lipoprotein-depleted serum increased mRNA-controlled protein (eGFP) production substantially. This complies with model membrane data and suggests that protein corona formation on the surface of the LNPs influences the nature of the interaction between LNPs and endosomal membranes.",

Adsorption of biomolecules such as proteins is an inevitable process that takes place instantaneously upon contact with physiological fluid (e.g. blood). Therefore, strategies are needed to control this process in order to improve the properties of the nanoparticles and to allow targeted drug delivery. Here, we show that the design of the protein corona by a pre-formed protein corona with tailored properties enables targeted cellular interactions. Nanoparticles were pre-coated with immunoglobulin depleted plasma to create and design a protein corona that reduces cellular uptake by immune cells. It was proven that a pre-formed protein corona remains stable even after nanoparticles were re-introduced to plasma. This opens up the great potential to exploit protein corona formation, which will significantly influence the development of novel nanomaterials.",

            "text": "LSNPs. To decipher the underlying mechanisms contributing to the lung-specificity of LSNPs-mediated protein delivery, we performed a comprehensive analysis of various factors influencing the tissue tropism of nanoparticles. These included an examination of nanoparticles surface charge, size, and protein corona formed in vivo. We first compared the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles showing liver (assembled at \u03b2-CD-PEI to Ada-MOP of 6:1) and lung (assembled at \u03b2-CD-PEI to Ada-MOP of 10:1)-targeting effect. As shown in SI Appendix, Fig. S13A (SI Appendix), both types of nanoparticles exhibited an average diameter of around 110 nm. However, there was a significant difference exists between the nanoparticle surface charge: lungtargeted LSNPs exhibited a higher positive zeta potential (19.8 mV) compared to liver-targeted LSNPs (7.81 mV). This disparity in charge led us to hypothesize that it significantly influences plasma protein adsorption on nanoparticle surface in circulation, thereby dictating tissue specificity. To verify this hypothesis, we performed proteomic profiling of the surface-absorbed protein of LSNPs incubated with murine serum. After isolating surfaceadsorbed proteins, mass spectrometry analysis revealed distinct protein corona composition for these nanoparticles. Lung-targeted nanoparticles harbored 375 proteins, while liver-targeted ones contained 433 proteins, with 277 proteins common to both (SI Appendix, Fig. S13B). A Venn diagram illustrated the protein distribution (SI Appendix, Fig. S13B), indicating 98 unique proteins to lung-targeted nanoparticles. Among the top twenty most abundant proteins, only nine were shared between the two types of nanoparticles. Notably, liver-targeted nanoparticles predominantly exhibited apolipoprotein A (ApoA), aligning with prior reports of the role of ApoA in hepatic-targeting delivery (SI Appendix, Fig. S13C) (24,25).",

Moreover, monovalent and divalent cations may affect aggregate formation. Adsorption of media components, serum proteins and Ca 2+ on nanoparticle surface determines NP aggregations and size distribution [14]. Agglomeration leads to cytotoxicity reduction, because of lower availability of inorganic NPs in contact with cells. In addition, the size of aggregates prevents their cellular internalisation [39]. Studies based on silica nanoparticles indicated that minimization of NP aggregation could be obtained by introducing an optimum balance of inert (e.g., methyl phosphonate) and active (e.g., hydroxyl and aldehyde) functional groups to the surface [41]. \n\nThe protein layer of several nanometres on particle surface is called protein corona and it can be divided into a peripheral soft corona (SC)-dynamic protein exchanges with the surrounding medium-and a hard corona (HC)-a layer of more or less temporal constant composition (Figure 2, Table 2) [34,42,43]. In blood plasma, the surface of nanoparticles mainly adsorbs proteins, but some minor traces of lipids have also been found in the corona structure. Adsorption of proteins on the nanoparticle surface is the result of protein-nanoparticle binding affinities and protein-protein interactions. Hard corona interacts directly with the nanomaterial surface. Soft corona proteins interact with the hard corona via weak proteinprotein interactions. Interestingly, the corona on the NP surface does not completely mask the nanomaterial surface or its functional groups [43]. The formation of protein corona and its thickness is a parameter that is also dependent on protein concentration, temperature, duration of particle-protein interaction, serum concentration and shear stress [34,44]. \n\nProtein corona formation strongly affects cellular uptake mechanism, cell-nanoparticle interactions, intracellular location as well as cellular response (e.g., biocompatibility) [34,35,44].",

            "text": "For instance, vitronectin in the corona was found to increase uptake via \u03b1\u03bd\u03b23 integrin receptor in vitro and in vivo [145,146]. Similarly, it was suggested that apolipoprotein E in the corona facilitates nanoparticle transcytosis across the blood brain barrier [147], while we and others found that silica nanoparticles are internalized by cells upon interaction of apolipoproteins in their corona with the low density lipoprotein receptor, LDLR [148,149]. Interestingly, this specific interaction was observed only when forming a corona using high serum concentrations, mimicking in vivo blood plasma concentration. This kind of observations challenges the use of standard low concentration of serum or also artificial serum-free conditions when testing nanomedicines and targeted drugs in vitro. Thus the proteins adsorbed on the nanomedicine can enable new ways to achieve targeted uptake into specific cells, and similar effects have been observed also in vivo. An example of this is that of Onpattro, a lipid nanoparticle carrying small interfering RNA (siRNA) and which -as mentioned previously-adsorbs apoE from plasma, thus promoting uptake into the liver hepatocytes via the LDLR [11]. \n\nOn the opposite side, the binding of other proteins known as \"dysopsonin\" proteins, such as for instance albumin, can prolong plasma residence time [150,151]. Similarly, it has been reported that certain corona proteins adsorbed on nanomedicines in blood can also be read by immune cells as a don't-eat-me signal. An example of a corona protein associated with reduced uptake by cells via this kind of mechanisms is clusterin [152]. Interestingly, the authors identified this protein as a major component in the corona forming on PEGylated nanoparticles and suggested that it is this specific protein in the corona to confer the socalled PEG \"stealth-effect\", as opposed to the overall reduced protein binding. Recently reduced uptake has been observed also for nanoparticles with a corona rich in histidine rich glycoprotein [153,154].",

The binding of proteins or other biomolecules to nanoparticle surfaces may thereby afford a new \"identity\" to the nanoparticle 24 . Deng et al. 25 showed that poly(acrylic acid)-coated gold nanoparticles bind fibrinogen, a protein involved in blood clot formation, in a charge-dependent manner, inducing unfolding of the protein, and that binding to integrin receptors on the surface of the monocytic cell line, THP-1 leads to activation of the nuclear factor-\u03baB pathway and secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1. In a comprehensive study using a panel of silica and polystyrene nanoparticles of various sizes and surface modifications, Tenzer et al. 26 could show that plasma protein adsorption occurs very rapidly, and that it affects hemolysis, thrombocyte activation, cellular uptake, and endothelial cell death. Vlasova et al. 27 reported that adsorbed plasma proteins influenced neutrophil responses caused by polymer-coated, single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs). Specifically, the adsorption of IgG resulted in neutrophil activation, as determined by degranulation and release of myeloperoxidase (MPO). Similarly, protein adsorption modulated neutrophil responses toward carboxylated, non-PEGylated SWCNTs 28 . Lara et al. 29 employed an immuno-mapping technique to study epitope presentation of two major proteins in the serum corona, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and immunoglobulin G. The authors could show that both proteins displayed functional motifs allowing for recognition of the bio-corona on silica nanoparticles by LDL receptor and Fc-\u03b3 receptor I, respectively. On the other hand, others have pointed out that the bio-corona could shield targeting ligands on nanoparticles 30 . However, recent studies suggested clever ways in which to circumvent this problem 31,32 .",

            "text": "We also observed a negative correlation between the level of in vitro monocyte phagocytosis of lipid nanoparticles and anti-PEG IgG expansion (Figure 6c). These findings suggest that the amounts of mRNA lipid nanoparticles that remain in the blood (and free of phagocytosis) may influence the PEG antibody immunogenicity in humans. This phenomenon only affected PEG immunogenicity as the mRNA levels in the blood were not significantly correlated with the expansion of spikebinding IgG or neutralizing antibodies (Figure 5d). This is consistent with PEG being expressed on the surface of the lipid nanoparticle, whereas the spike protein, the target of neutralization and spike binding IgG, is only expressed following the mRNA transfection of cells. Larger cohort studies and animal studies are required to confirm the causal relationship between the levels of mRNA lipid nanoparticles in blood and the expansion of anti-PEG antibodies. \n\nAdditional factors could influence the biodistribution and immunogenicity of mRNA lipid vaccines. Humans display a diverse range of plasma lipids and proteins. Similar differences are likely to be found in lymphatic fluids, which vaccines must traverse. \u221228 We previously showed that clinically relevant drug-loaded liposomes displayed a large variance in immune cell association in human blood, depending on the compositions of person-specific biomolecular coronas. 21 The formation of biomolecular corona on drugloaded liposomes in vivo in human blood has been previously described. 29 The composition of biomolecular coronas has been shown to influence the fate and functionality of lipid nanoparticles. 30,31 An analysis of the in vivo or ex vivo corona formation on mRNA vaccines could help further characterize mRNA vaccine distribution and immunogenicity. \n\nOverall, our study provides important information on the kinetics of mRNA lipid nanoparticle vaccines in human blood in vivo and their impact on vaccine and PEG immunogenicity. Enhancing our understanding on the biodistribution of mRNA lipid nanoparticles in humans should ultimately help improve the safety and efficacy of mRNA vaccines and therapeutics.",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been successful in delivering nucleic acids like siRNA and mRNA, but face challenges in protein delivery due to limited protein encapsulation and endosome escape. In this study, a family of LNPs is developed with robust high efficiency in addressing the multiple barriers in cytosolic protein delivery by incorporating clinically approved ionizable lipids into traditional cationic LNPs. The combination of cationic and ionizable lipids enables efficient protein binding and endosomal escape. Optimized LNPs efficiently deliver various proteins, including antibodies, enzymes, toxins, and Cas9 into living cells with reserved functions. Moreover, the designed LNPs show high serum stability during protein delivery, and the serum albumin adsorbed on LNPs facilitates protein delivery via albumin receptor\u2010mediated endocytosis, enabling highly efficient protein delivery in vivo. The optimized LNPs successfully deliver therapeutic proteins such as saporin and interleukin\u201010 (IL\u201010) to inhibit tumor growth in several animal models. The IL\u201010 loaded LNPs enhanced the proliferation and cytotoxicity of T cells and improved the antitumor effect of adoptive transferred OT\u20101 CD8+ T cells to melanoma. This study expands the applications of LNPs for the delivery of biomacromolecules, and the developed LNP formulations have enormous potential for the delivery of protein therapeutics to treat various diseases.",

            "text": "Findings from screening indicated that LNPs containing ionizable lipids with distinct bonds in their tails, O-series (ester bonds) versus N-series (amide bonds) lipids shifted the delivery from liver to lung.Analysis of the protein corona composition revealed that N-series LNPs were enriched in vitronectin, fibrinogen, fibronectin, and proteins that are known to bind the vitronectin receptor  v  3, [81] possibly accounting for their lung tropism.Conversely, the O-series LNPs' corona exhibited a high ApoE enrichment, a fact that might explain their liver tropism. [82]This study underscores the impact of seemingly minor changes in the lipids' chemical features on corona constituents.\n\nThe mentioned SORT approach has demonstrated its applicability beyond lung targeting, as on a similar note the incorporation of a negatively charged phospholipid like phosphatidic acid into LNPs was reported to promote the attachment of  2glycoprotein I.As a result, specific delivery to the spleen was achieved. [77]The interaction between  2 -glycoprotein I and acidic phospholipids has been described previously, reinforcing the rational incorporation of these lipids into NPs to specifically attract serum proteins facilitating spleen targeting. [83]ome authors have argued that it is possible to extend the circulation time of PEGylated liposomes through their conjugation with an albumin-binding domain (ABD).This led to eightfold enrichment in albumin content within the corona, contributing to increased tumor accumulation. [84,85]Similarly, arginine-lipid based siRNA polyplexes, which exhibited notable albumin association on their surface, were also associated with prolonged circulation times. [86]he examination of the concepts around endogenous targeting necessitates cautious assessment in terms of their translatability, given the multifaceted factors contributing to specific protein corona formation.Among these, hydrophobicity, surface chemistry, and charge do not depend only on NP components but on their structural arrangement.

The preparation of methotrexate as solid-lipid NPs (SLNs) was demonstrated to reduce the production of TNF\u03b1 and IL-6 proinflammatory cytokines significantly following the incubation with J774.A1 macrophages compared to the free drug [231]. It was demonstrated that the injection of amiodarone-loaded LNPs as an immune modulator enhanced the therapeutic activity and reduced the toxicity in rat models [246]. \n\nIt should be noted that the understanding of the protein corona, a layer surrounding the NP, is crucial for designing a safe and efficient atherosclerosis treatment. The corona's composition can affect the NP interaction and drug-release profiles; therefore, it could interfere with the therapeutic efficacy [259]. New strategies like zwitterionic coatings and controlling corona structure can reduce protein corona's obstructive effect in drug targeting and release [260]. Moreover, the conjugation of PEG on the outer surface of designed NPs is an additional strategy that is reported to reduce the effect of protein corona adhesion [261].",

On the other hand, for lipid B, LNPs made with DEPE showed higher hEPO levels over B-DOPE LNPs only for IV (p < 0.05) but not for the IM dosing route (Figure 2C,D). \n\nIn the context of systemic delivery, LNPs in circulation undergo dynamic interactions with serum proteins forming a protein corona, which has significant implications on the kinetics, interactions, and affinity of the LNPs with different cell types. 24 Composition and formulation changes in LNPs can alter the protein corona, thereby modulating LNP\u2212cell interactions. 25 For instance, the binding of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) affects LNP uptake by hepatocytes through the lowdensity lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). PC-and PE-based helper lipids formulated into LNPs can differentially influence their ApoE adsorption and thus hepatic delivery. 13 Recently, Zhou et al. demonstrated efficient dendritic cell (DC) uptake of ApoE3-incorporated biomimetic nanoparticles through the macropinocytosis pathway for cancer immunotherapy. 26 In this work, we observed that incorporating PE-based helper lipids with differing tail lengths into LNPs resulted in significant differences in their potencies through different routes of delivery. To investigate if these differences could be attributed to differential ApoE binding, the four LNPs were evaluated for their ApoE affinity using a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D). The dissipation and frequency shifts of all four sensors were monitored in real time (Figure 2E\u2212G).",

The components of protein corona rather than the nanoparticle per se are typically recognized by receptors on the cell surface. For example, in the case of DNAlipid nanoparticles, vitronectin enriched on particles associates with \u03b1 v \u03b2 3 integrins on cancer cells [22]. Analogously, for targeting to hepatocytes, interaction with apolipoproteins is required for some siRNA lipoplexes [23,24]. Remarkably, the liver tropism of the first siRNA drug, Onpattro, is based on the ability of lipid nanoparticles to recruit into its PC apolipoprotein E that enables specific hepatocyte targeting [11,25,26]. Recently, the preformed protein corona was harnessed to convert nanoparticles targetable to tumour cells. For that, particles were coated with tumour-specific antibodies and human serum albumin that helps to prevent phagocytosis of the particles [27][28][29].\n\nOn the other hand, protein corona can interfere with targeted delivery by masking the ligand on the nanoparticle surface that specifically interacts with endocytosis triggering receptors [30,31]. The composition and properties of forming protein corona highly depend on one hand on the type and properties of nanoparticles, like composition, size, charge, hydrophobicity etc., [10,[32][33][34][35] and on the other, on environmental factors, like temperature, [36,37] incubation time [17,38] and, especially, on the biofluid type, [39][40][41] origin and disease [42,43]. In general, protein corona on the smaller nanoparticles is thinner and less dense than on the larger ones [44,45]. In addition, cationic nanoparticles are cleared from circulation much faster than neutral or anionic counterparts [46]. Thus, one of the potential obstacles for cellular uptake of CPP-nucleic acid nano",

            "text": "Depending on the administration site, the biomolecules that will interact with the NPs can vary: from lung surfactants when inhaled to the interstitial fluid when locally injected into blood plasma following intravenous administration (73). Proteins, which are the most important of these biomolecules, will adsorb -to some extent-on the NP surface, especially as PEG is removed, coating the surface with a new layer that will define the biological identity of the NP, the so-called \"biomolecular corona\", or \"protein corona\" (74,75) which can dramatically alter the surface properties of nanosized particles and determine their in vivo fate (76). Already in 2004, it was reported that the presence of proteins in physiological media affects the entry and intracellular localization of NPs in cells, thus modulating their potential biological effects and toxicity. Later on, the formation of a protein corona on top of the NP surface was observed to control biodistribution, uptake and biological response, transforming them from innocuous to toxic or vice versa. This surface coating can be formed by hundreds of b i o m o l e c u l e s , i n c l u d i n g a l b u m i n , a p o l i p o p r o t e i n s , immunoglobulins, coagulation factors, and many others (77). Some of these biomolecules might associate almost irreversibly with the iLNP surface, in either their native or denatured form, affecting, de facto, all subsequent interactions. It has been proposed that the corona is comprised of both these tightly bound proteins (\"hard\" corona), which presumably bind directly to the iLNP surface with high affinity, and also a looser, more dynamic layer (\"soft\" corona) which constantly exchanges with proteins in the environment (78). The hard and soft corona are both considered relevant in determining iLNP interactions with cells (73). \n\nTraditionally, for biomedical applications, this corona has only been conceived as a disruptive effect that hinders the functionality of nanoparticles, provoking underestimated side effects like loss of colloidal stability, aggregation, sedimentation or rapid clearance by the immune system.",

            "text": "Next, we examined the effect of DOPE-C8 on the biodistribution of LNPs. The blood half-life of the DOPE-C8-LNPs was clearly less than 10 min (Figure S1, Supporting Information); therefore, the biodistribution of the LNPs 1 h after intravenous injection was examined using IVIS (Figure 2D). The DOPE-Cx showed a significantly higher level of accumulation in the kidney compared with that when using DSPC, albeit at lower values. No differences between LNPs were observed for other organs. The highest accumulation was in the liver, which was followed by slight accumulations in the spleen and lungs. Intrahepatic distribution of the LNPs revealed that consistent levels of all LNPs accumulate mainly in hepatocytes, which are located in an area enclosed by blood vessels (Figure 2E). These results suggest that DOPE-C8 has a limited effect on the biodistribution of LNPs and that the improved mRNA expression level derives from intracellular processes such as endosomal escape. \n\nWhen nanoparticles such as LNPs are exposed to proteins such as blood, they form a protein-based layer on their surface, which is referred to as the biomolecular corona. [11] The physicochemical properties of LNPs affect their interactions with proteins and alter the biomolecular corona. The properties of the biomolecular corona are known to alter both the pharmacokinetics and the toxicity of LNPs. [12] Reports also show that phospholipids such as DSPC are preferentially located in the outer layer of LNPs due to their bulky hydrophilic moiety compared with that of other lipidic components such as ionizable lipids and cholesterol. [13] egatively charged phospholipids are known to selectively deliver mRNA to the spleen and secondary lymphoid organs. [14] e recently reported that the increased surface density of electrostatically neutral DSPC selectively delivers mRNA to the spleen rather than to the liver by abolishing ApoE-dependent hepatic clearance.

            "text": "Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is used in Lipid Nanoparticles (LNPs) formulations to confer stealth properties and is traditionally anchored in membranes by a lipid moiety whose length significantly impacts the LNPs fate in vivo. C18 acyl chains are efficiently anchored in the membrane, while shorter C14 lipids are quickly desorbed and replaced by a protein corona responsible for the completely different fate of LNPs. In this context, a method to predict the biological behavior of LNPs depending on the lipid-PEG dissociation was developed using the Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA) method in serum. Two formulations of siRNA-containing LNPs were prepared including CSL3 or SM-102 lipids and were grafted with different lipids-PEG (C18, C14 lipids-PEG, and Ceramide-PEG). The impact of the lipid-PEG on the interactions between LNPs and serum components was demonstrated by monitoring the mean particle size and the concentration over time. In vitro, these formulations demonstrated low toxicity and efficient gene knockdown on tumor MDA-MB-231 cells, but serum was found to significantly impact the efficiency of C18-PEG-based LNPs, while it did not impact the efficiency of C14-PEG-based LNPs. The NTA method demonstrated the ability to discriminate between the behaviors of LNPs according to serum proteins\u2019 interactions. CSL3 lipid and Cer-PEG were confirmed to have promise for LNP formulation.",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNP) have emerged as an effective nonviral delivery system for nucleic acid payloads due to their high encapsulation efficiency, low toxicity, ability to facilitate intracellular delivery, and the possibility to modulate their size and surface properties (1)(2)(3). The technological advances carried out in the past three decades have enabled the clinical approval of the first LNP-based siRNA therapeutic, Onpattro (4)(5)(6), which quickly became a landmark formulation that paved the way for the widespread use of LNP as nucleic acid delivery systems (2,7,8) and for the worldwide rollout of the LNP-based vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 (9). However, like many other nanomedicines, LNP suffer from a low selectivity and specificity for target cells and organs and limits clinical translation (10,11). First of all, nanoparticles can be rapidly sequestered by macrophages into the liver and other secondary lymphoid organs, which impair their delivery to target tissues (12). Moreover, while ligand-targeted nanomedicines show a higher efficacy in vitro compared to their untargeted counterpart, this advantage is often lost in vivo due to masking from the formation of a biomolecular protein corona (BMC) (13). The formation of a BMC can be an advantage as several groups have shown that once i.v. administered, the BMC could enable LNPs to possess extrinsic targeting properties, directing them towards specific cell receptors (14-18). An early example of this includes Onpattro, as its ability to interact with specific serum proteins (Apolipoprotein E) after i.v. administrations, directs the LNP towards low-density lipoprotein receptors on the surface of hepatocytes (5,6,19). More recently, studies have focused on extrahepatic delivery by optimizing the physiochemical properties of LNPs to drive distinct BMC profiles, subsequently, enabling targeting of nonliver organs such as the spleen or lungs (20)(21)(22).",

            "text": "We have developed a new type of magnetic LNP as a model for using MS to study the BMC of LNPs. We have established an experimental workflow that is highly versatile for the isolation of an intact LNP with the adsorbed protein corona as shown in Scheme 1. \n\nCommon BMC separation techniques such as centrifugation have previously been implemented for identifying enriched proteins adsorbed on the surface of LNPs (21,22), however, the harsh separation process required likely affected the LNP integrity during pellet formation and may not effectively remove unbounded proteins (35). This MS method offers distinct advantages over conventional methods, such as the ability to use LNP formulation containing the same molar ratio and lipid composition as clinically relevant formulations while recovering isolated intact LNP-corona samples with lower amounts of unwanted free proteins. However, like most LNP-corona separation techniques, there are also limitations to the MS method. The IONP encapsulation process will need to be reoptimized for formulations containing different molar ratios of the ionizable lipid as the separation efficiency is expected to be positively correlated with the amount of ionizable lipid present. For example, lowering the ionizable lipid content in LNP formulations will likely lower the number of IONPs/LNP as there will be fewer protonated ionizable lipid molecules to complex with the negatively charged IONPs when formulating at low pH. However, because the MS method relies on material encapsulated in the core of the LNP, rather than isolation methods that depend on changing the surface properties, we suggest that the protein profiles observed are more representative of the actual BMC experienced in vivo. LNP technology is a state-of-the-art approach that is paving the way for the widespread use of LNP-based gene therapeutics including the COVID-19 messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines (36). It is well established that the BMC can dramatically affect the tropism of LNPs as illustrated by the influence of adsorbed apo-E on uptake of Onpattro LNP into hepatocytes (4).",

            "text": "Circulating proteins rapidly adsorb to the surface of liposomes, forming a protein corona that is the interface for biological interactions (Caracciolo, 2015;Corbo et al., 2016). The mechanisms of protein adsorption and the impact of the protein corona composition on interactions with the innate immune system have been reviewed in depth (Caracciolo, 2015;Barbero et al., 2017). The protein corona contributes to particle opsonization and phagocytic clearance, and may also lead to formation of immune complexes, immunogenic epitope generation from self-antigens, and activation or suppression of immune responses (Caracciolo, 2015;Corbo et al., 2016;Barbero et al., 2017). Moreover, the protein corona can interfere with targeting functions of liposomes surface-conjugated to active targeting molecules such as antibodies (Nellis et al., 2005;Suzuki et al., 2008). Recent work in understanding the protein corona has shown that its composition is dynamic and highly variable, depending on the physicochemical characteristics of the nanoparticle as well as fluctuations in host circulating proteins. This may especially be relevant for cancer nanomedicines due to profound and heterogenous immune dysfunction associated with different types of cancer (Rosenberg, 2001). A major implication of this is that in vitro studies and studies in \"healthy\" animals are not sufficient to fully characterize the protein corona and biological impact of liposomal drugs intended for treatment of cancer. \n\nLiposome interactions with circulating complement proteins can also lead to activation of the complement cascade (Alving, 1992;Verma et al., 1992;Szebeni et al., 2002;Dobrovolskaia et al., 2008), generating complement cleavage products that are opsonins (e.g., C3b) and fragments that are anaphylatoxins (e.g., C5a). The latter have been associated with development of acute infusion reactions in patients known as complement activationrelated pseudoallergy (CARPA) (Chanan-Khan et al., 2003).",

            "text": "The corona formed on MLNCs is not similar to the coronas in the form of a uniform cloud around metal and polymer NPs presented in a number of publications [10,[23][24][25]. We believe that the shape of the corona on the MLNC is due to the uneven surface properties of the lipid-peptide envelope of this nanoconstruct, as well as the high diversity of proteins in the serum. \n\nEvidence in favor of this assumption comes from recent publications on corona studies on extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are naturally occurring lipid-enveloped NPs and play important roles in many physiological processes. The uneven distribution of transmembrane proteins in the EV membrane, shown by super-resolution fluorescence microscopy, may determine the uneven binding of environmental proteins to the membrane, followed by \"uneven\" corona on the surface of the vesicles described [26]. \n\nThe formation of a corona consisting of large protein aggregates randomly sorbed on the surface of EVs was demonstrated using confocal microscopy [27]. The belonging of these aggregates to the protein corona was confirmed by immunoelectron microscopy and changes in membrane structure of naked and coronated EVs on ultrathin sections. These results reflect the complexity of the interaction of the lipid membranes of natural EVs with environmental proteins and are not surprising. We think that the structure of the corona observed on MLNC is consistent with the corona variants described in [27]. \n\nOn the surface of MLNCs bearing a corona, spherical electron-dense particles (20-50 nm) are sometimes found (Figure 14H). In the center of the particles, a \"light\" core, surrounded by an uneven layer of high electron density, can be recognized. The structure and size of these particles make it possible to identify them as lipoproteins (non-vesicles) present in serum and other biological fluids [28,29]. \n\nThe appearance of a full corona on the surface of the MLNCs after UV irradiation allows us to conclude that it was the fixation of the components of the soft corona to the hard (\"invisible\" in TEM) that made it possible to obtain a visible, complete corona.",

The adsorption of proteins to nanoparticle surface establish a protein corona has been given particular attention in the recent years, particularly within the context of nanomedicine targeting. Since many proteins are amphipathic, they have the potential to interact with almost any nanoparticle surface in their vicinity. Consequently, the interfacial interactions of nanoparticles with proteins are inevitable in such environments. In concordance, as expressed thermodynamically by D ads G < 0 (where D ads G symbolises the Gibbs free energy of adsorption), this mechanism of lowering the excess surface energy of nanoparticles is spontaneous. 40 The surface adsorption of serum proteins by particles (opsonisation) was \ue103rst postulated by Wright and Douglas in 1903. 41 Later in 1962, whilst assessing the surface adsorption of \ue103brinogen in blood plasma, Vroman noticed that the maximum surface concentration of \ue103brinogen was attained at an intermediate time point, suggestive of its substitution by other proteins with time. 42 Described by the Vroman effect, corona formation is a dynamic and competitive process. The initial stages of adsorption are dominated by small (high mobility), abundant proteins. However, with time, some of these proteins are substituted by those which are larger (low mobility), less abundant and have greater affinity for the surface. 43 An equilibrium is gradually attained, a\ue09der which each protein has equal rates of association and dissociation, and further exchange causes no change in the corona's composition. 44 As illustrated in Fig. 2, the protein corona branches into a 'hard corona' and 'so\ue09d corona'; these denote a \ue103rmly bound, equilibrium state layer (wherein proteins exhibit high affinity for the nanoparticle surface), and a loosely bound layer (comprised of low-affinity proteins in rapid exchange with those in the medium), respectively. 45,46 An intrinsic in\ue104uencer of protein corona composition is nanoparticle size.

However, incubation of NF55-SCO nanoparticles in murine serum for 60 min resulted in a significantly higher amount of C3 proteins in the corona compared to SCO alone. That may be caused by higher hydrophobicity of NF55 [81] or its complexes with SCO compared to PF14, and higher absorption of proteins, including C3, [87] on hydrophobic NPs [88]. In case of murine plasma, however, no significant differences were observed between any nanoparticles tested and the amount of C3 proteins adsorbed to nanoparticles was rather equal (Figure 4c  or SCO alone were bound to streptavidin on superparamagnetic beads or beads were left untreated (control) before incubation with murine serum (a,b) or murine plasma (c,d) for 5 or 60 min at room temperature. After pull-down, bound C3 and its fragments were quantified by Western blot.

Here we show that in bloodstream, CPP-NA nanoparticles acquire a novel nano-biomolecular interface and recruit into protein corona anti-opsonising proteins like serum albumin, clusterin and apolipoproteins at a higher extent compared to only nucleic acids-containing particles. Moreover, CPPs reduce inclusion of C3 protein in protein corona on pDNA particles and thereby might prolong circulation of respective nanoparticles in organism before elimination (Figure 3c,d) [83,84].",

            "text": "Nanomaterials adopt a new \"identity\" in the body through the adsorption of proteins and other biomolecules (Nel et al., 2009). This phenomenon, known as bio-corona formation, is dependent upon intrinsic properties of the nanomaterials including size or surface curvature and surface chemistry (Cedervall et al., 2007;Lundqvist et al., 2008;Tenzer et al., 2011) and on the physiological environment (i.e., the extracellular or intracellular milieu). Thus, the biological identity of nanomaterials is context dependent (Nystr\u00f6m & Fadeel, 2012). Importantly, while most publications are focused on the protein corona, one should not ignore other biomolecules including lipids, as lipid-binding proteins are commonly found in the bio-corona of nanoparticles (Hellstrand et al., 2009). \n\nThe environmental dimensions of the protein corona (often referred to as the \"eco-corona\") have been expertly covered (Wheeler et al., 2021) and will not be discussed here. \n\nIn our previous survey of bio-corona research, it was noted that we and others had deployed proteomics approaches to catalogue the proteins present on the surface of a wide range of nanomaterials including spherical particles such as superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) or polystyrene (PS) particles and fiber-like materials including single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) (Fadeel et al., 2013). The majority of these studies were carried out using human plasma or fetal bovine serum (FBS), and in many cases, several hundred proteins were identified in the biocorona (Tenzer et al., 2013). However, these results prompt several questions: first, why do so many different proteins congregate on the surface of nanoparticles? Indeed, as previously pointed out, it seems counterintuitive that \"proteins in the blood that evolved not to bind nonspecifically to each other would do so around nanoparticles\" (Lundqvist & Cedervall, 2020).",

            "text": "Nanoparticles typically refer to tiny particles ranging from 1 to 100 nm, with their larger surface area and nanoscale size endowing them with unique physicochemical properties [73]. These nanoparticles can consist of single substances such as titanium dioxide, silver nanoparticles, gold nanoparticles, iron oxides, or complexes such as polymer-drug complexes, and nucleic acid-nanoparticle complexes, among others [74][75][76][77]. When nanoparticles enter living organisms, they first come into contact with biological fluids (e.g., blood, tissue fluids, etc.). Various components in biofluids, such as proteins, lipids, sugars, etc., quickly adsorb to the surface of the nanoparticles, forming the so-called \"protein corona\". The composition and structure of the protein corona depend on the physicochemical properties of the nanoparticles (e.g., size, shape, surface charge, hydrophilicity, etc.) and the environment of the biofluid (e.g., protein concentration, pH, ionic strength, etc.) [78,79]. For example, gold nanoparticles are smaller in size but have a relatively large specific surface area, which can provide more binding sites for proteins and make it easier to adsorb some low-molecular-weight proteins, such as albumin and transferrin [80]. Polymer nanoparticles with a diameter of several hundred nanometers may bind more to macromolecular proteins such as immunoglobulins [81]. The formation of protein corona will change the surface properties of nanoparticles and affect their subsequent interactions with biological systems, such as biorecognition, immune response, and cellular uptake of nanoparticles [82,83]. Nanoparticles may be recognized by the immune system as a foreign body, triggering an immune response. Immune cells such as macrophages and monocytes can ingest nanoparticles through phagocytosis, which can lead to the removal of nanoparticles before they reach the target site, reducing the efficiency of drug delivery.",

            "text": "cells. In vivo and in vitro LNP transfection results were poorly correlated. It was demonstrated that natural cholesterol analogs enhance the endosomal escape of LNPs, while the presence of natural structural lipids on nanoparticle surfaces forms a corona when dispersed in biological fluids. [187] mRNA delivery to T cells was studied by creating a vast library of LNPs. Structural analogs of immune-cell targeted ionizable lipid materials were synthesized via Michael addition chemistry. Alkyl chains terminated with epoxide groups were reacted with polyamine cores of varying lengths. Using microfluidic chips, a combination of 24 ionizable lipids, cholesterol, helper lipids, and PEG-lipids were used to encapsulate mRNA and form LNP complexes ranging from 51 to 97 nm. Screening of the process detected improved mRNA delivery for seven LNP formulations, compared to commercially available lipofectamine. No significant correlation was observed among LNP size, concentration of the genetic molecules, or the pKa of ionizable lipid with the enhanced delivery of the cargo. Furthermore, LNPs containing purified saturated ionizable lipids improved mRNA delivery over that of crude lipid formulations. [188] LNPs were also used to deliver mRNA for hemophilia treatment. In this investigation, lipid components consisting of ionizable lipid distearoylphosphatidylcholine, cholesterol, and PEG-lipid were mixed with synthesized mRNAs to synthesize mRNA LNPs. LNP complexes of sizes smaller than 100 nm, more than 80% RNA encapsulation efficiency, and less than 10 endotoxin units were obtained. Thanks to a bioluminescence signal in the liver and a weak or absence of signal in the spleen or other organs, it was suggested that LNPs efficiently delivered mRNA to the liver. Repeated injections of LNPs, however, induced the inhibitor formation of short-lived factors. [189] In the case of long-term storage of LNPs carriers, specifically COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, little is known about the physical stability of lipid nanoparticles. Zhao et al. set out to perform a systematic study of various conditions, such as temperature and physical state",

            "text": "Nanoparticles typically refer to tiny particles ranging from 1 to 100 nm, with their larger surface area and nanoscale size endowing them with unique physicochemical properties [73]. These nanoparticles can consist of single substances such as titanium dioxide, silver nanoparticles, gold nanoparticles, iron oxides, or complexes such as polymer-drug complexes, and nucleic acid-nanoparticle complexes, among others [74][75][76][77]. When nanoparticles enter living organisms, they first come into contact with biological fluids (e.g., blood, tissue fluids, etc.). Various components in biofluids, such as proteins, lipids, sugars, etc., quickly adsorb to the surface of the nanoparticles, forming the so-called \"protein corona\". The composition and structure of the protein corona depend on the physicochemical properties of the nanoparticles (e.g., size, shape, surface charge, hydrophilicity, etc.) and the environment of the biofluid (e.g., protein concentration, pH, ionic strength, etc.) [78,79]. For example, gold nanoparticles are smaller in size but have a relatively large specific surface area, which can provide more binding sites for proteins and make it easier to adsorb some low-molecular-weight proteins, such as albumin and transferrin [80]. Polymer nanoparticles with a diameter of several hundred nanometers may bind more to macromolecular proteins such as immunoglobulins [81]. The formation of protein corona will change the surface properties of nanoparticles and affect their subsequent interactions with biological systems, such as biorecognition, immune response, and cellular uptake of",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been widely used as carriers to deliver mRNAs [27,108,109]. The first conducted clinical trial of mRNA vaccines is LNP-delivered. LNPs are mature negatively-charged nucleic acid delivery platforms characterized as ionizable amino lipids, polyethylene glycol, phospholipids and cholesterol. The essential ionizable amino lipids facilitate mRNA to escape from the endosome by interacting with ionizable amino lipids and the endosomal membrane [110]. Polyethylene glycol is another essential component to prolong LNP circulation time because it spatially hinders the binding of mRNA and plasma proteins, which accelerates the clearance by reticuloendothelial (ER). Phospholipids and cholesterol can stably integrate the LNP structure [111]. To be specific, LNPs have two advantages as an mRNA vaccine vector. On the one hand, LNPs defend mRNA from degradation by enzymes from the endosome [112]. The characteristic guarantees high encapsulation efficiency [113]. On the other hand, LNPs have good biocompatibility through a series of biological processes to deliver mRNAs for expression. The first process involves the apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) pathway. This endogenous pathway is a targeting foundation for efficient delivery [113]. Then, the TLR4-mediated endocytosis takes up LNPs, forming a vesicle to fuse with endosomes [114]. After escaping endosomes, LNPs release mRNA into the cytoplasm to synthesize vaccine antigens.\n\nThe delivery efficacy of LNPs relies on multiple lipid components and lipid-related modifications. Foremost, the primary substance is cationic or ionizable lipids. Various cationic or ionizable lipids are used to deliver RNA, such as N- [118] and N 1 ,N 3 ,N 5 -tris(3-(didodecylamino)propyl)benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxamide (TT3) [119]. These",

The doping LNPs with lipids containing quaternary ammonium groups can selectively deliver mRNA or CRISPR-Cas9 for specific lung diseases in the lungs. 47 Similarly, both zwitterionic amino lipids and cationic quaternary sulfonamide amino lipids have permanent cationic quaternary ammonium functional groups and can also be used to design lung-targeted LNPs. 25 The more detailed LNPs compositions for extrahepatic delivery are summarized by Dilliard S.A. and Siegwart D.J. 20 Furthermore, the length of the alkyl chain on the phosphate side determines organ selectivity. The iPhos with 9-12 and 13-16 carbon chain lengths deliver mRNA to the liver and the spleen, respectively. 47 The possible underlying mechanism for only small difference in structure to cause such astonishing organ specificity may be the result of a specific protein or the synergistic action of several proteins, but further research is still needed. Once injected into the bloodstream, LNPs can selectively control the adsorption of specific plasma proteins, acting as targeted ligands to direct LNPs to selected organs. Taking O-series and N-series LNPs as an example, the first three proteins in the coronoid of 306-N16B LNPs are serum albumin, fibrinogen b chain, and fibrinogen gamma chain, among which fibrinogen encapsulation can improve endothelial cell adhesion and endothelalization, which may be the main reason for lung targeting. However, the highest enriched protein in 306-O12B LNPs corona is apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which is involved in lipid and cholesterol metabolism and mediates LNPs delivery to the liver. In addition, the zeta potential of the two LNP S did not differ significantly, and both showed a slightly negative surface charge, suggesting that surface charge may not be the only factor influencing the interaction between NPs and proteins in biological fluids. 35 verall, the ionization of lipid structure can be driven by the type of organs and cells.",

Further, artificially anchored NPs with a single protein corona either by the apolipoproteins ApoA4 or ApoC3 demonstrated a significantly reduced cellular uptake as illustrated in Figure 8A, while pre-coating other corona proteins such as ApoH improved the cellular uptake, as shown in Figure 8B [62]. Further, to examine the impact of protein corona on the synthetic identity of lipidbased nanoparticles (LNP) in biological systems, Chen et al. detailed the analysis of PC NPs which revealed that there was a \"missing connection\" between the physicochemical properties of NPs and their biological identity. However, there is a limited understanding of the impact of protein corona on the targeted delivery of tumors. It was demonstrated that protein corona on the surface of NPs could be manipulated by the design and development of a formulation. The alteration in the composition of the lipid component in LNPs could potentially change the charge on the NPs' surface and finally change the formed corona patterns in the serum of nude mice. Thus, lipid surface charge manipulation and a specific lipid switch on the NPs could alter the PC profile. In spite of this fact, negatively charged NPs had no profound effect on the formation of protein corona, while the institution of positively charged lipids into the nanosystem dramatically switched the pattern of PC from apolipoprotein to vitronectin-rich. The composition of this variant of protein corona had a great impact on cell transfection, biodistribution in vivo, and the efficient active delivery to tumor tissues. The corona rich with apolipoprotein demonstrated improved delivery to hepatocellular carcinoma mediated via the LDL receptor which was equated with vitronectin-rich NPs.",

            "text": "Background: When nanoparticles (NPs) are applied into a biological fluid, such as blood, proteins bind rapidly to their surface forming a so-called \u201cprotein corona\u201d. These proteins are strongly attached to the NP surface and confers them a new biological identity that is crucial for the biological response in terms of body biodistribution, cellular uptake, and toxicity. The corona is dynamic in nature and it is well known that the composition varies in dependence of the physicochemical properties of the NPs. In the present study we investigated the protein corona that forms around poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) NPs at different serum concentrations using two substantially different serum types, namely fetal bovine serum (FBS) and human serum. The corona was characterized by means of sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), Bradford protein assay, zeta potential measurements, and liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS/MS). Additionally, the time-dependent cell interaction of PLGA NPs in the absence or presence of a preformed protein corona was assessed by in vitro incubation experiments with the human liver cancer cell line HepG2. Results: Our data revealed that the physiological environment critically affects the protein adsorption on PLGA NPs with significant impact on the NP\u2013cell interaction. Under comparable conditions the protein amount forming the protein corona depends on the serum type used and the serum concentration. On PLGA NPs incubated with either FBS or human serum a clear difference in qualitative corona protein composition was identified by SDS-PAGE and LC\u2013MS/MS in combination with bioinformatic protein classification. In the case of human serum a considerable change in corona composition was observed leading to a concentration-dependent desorption of abundant proteins in conjunction with an adsorption of high-affinity proteins with lower abundance. Cell incubation experiments revealed that the respective corona composition showed significant influence on the resulting nanoparticle\u2013cell interaction. Conclusion: Controlling protein corona formation is still a challenging task and our data highlight the need for a rational future experimental design in order to enable a prediction of the corona formation on nanoparticle surfaces",

            "text": "After entering the biological system, nanoparticles interact with the biomolecules in the body and will give rise to a layer called the \"corona\". This happens within seconds of nanoparticle exposure by a process called the Vroman effect. This layer consists of many biomolecules with increased adsorption and enhanced properties compared to those in the normal biological environment. Thus, this has a high impact on the ultimate performance of these nanoparticles. The liquid profile and protein composition of this corona layer have been extensively studied with respect to various works. According to the adsorption rate of proteins to their surface, the corona can be classified into two main categories: a hard corona and a soft corona. High affinity proteins tightly and directly associated with nanoparticles will form a hard corona, and low affinity proteins loosely and indirectly associated with nanoparticles will form a soft corona. While taking this into consideration, a hard corona is more convenient in terms of nanotechnology. The structure and composition of the corona layer can be studied by various techniques, such as DLS, SEC, DCS, TEM, PAGE, LC-MS/MS, DC, SPR, ITC, etc. Parameters like the number of bonds, thermodynamic feasibility of interaction, rearrangements of molecules, temperature, conformational changes, solvation, influence of other proteins, etc., determine the nanomaterial\u2212 protein adsorption effect. 11 Generally, there are 3 steps in the protein adsorption to nanoparticles, especially for gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) (Figure :2): \n\n\u2022 Region 1: characterized by protein\u2212NP surface interaction only with original protein conformation. \n\n\u2022 Region 2: characterized by protein\u2212protein interactions and protein\u2212NP interactions with changes in its structural conformations. \n\n\u2022 Region 3: characterized by protein\u2212protein interactions only, along with structural alterations and protein multilayer formation. \n\nThe composition of the corona is formed by different types of plasma proteins, viz., immunoglobulins, tissue leakage proteins, complement factors, coagulants, lipoproteins, and other serum components. They are collectively called \"adsorbomes\" after the adsorption mechanism.",

Pre-coating liposomes with an artificial corona made of human plasma proteins drastically reduces capture by circulating leukocytes in whole blood and may be an effective strategy to enable prolonged circulation in vivo. We conclude with a critical assessment of the key concepts of liposome technology that need to be reviewed for its definitive clinical translation. Protein corona formation is known to have significant effects upon nanomaterials application.

In fact, by increasing their pharmaceutical bioavailability and targeting, NPs avoid systemic toxicity while retaining pharmacological activity. 1 After intravenous injection, NPs adsorb a multitude of biological molecules (proteins, lipids, glycans, and metabolites) from plasma on their surface. These biomole cules continuously recycle 2,3 on the NP surface, thereby forming a dynamic shell known as a \"biomolecular corona.\" 4 Most research studying the biomolecular corona has focused on protein composition characterization: 5,6 therefore, the biomolecular corona is generally called the \"protein corona\" (PC). 7,8 This natural coating provides NPs with a new biological identity and significantly affects their fate, pharmacokinetics, and cellular interactions. \n\nIn terms of NP targeting abilities, the PC can 1) hinder the function of targeting ligands attached to the NP surface, thereby reducing their accumulation in the targeted tissue, 3,9,10 and 2) modify the carrier surface, facilitating cell internalization. 11 The PC can also modulate immune response. 12 Several studies have characterized PC structure, function, and formation dynamics. 13,14 Structurally, proteins that are weakly bound to the NP surface form the \"soft corona,\" while proteins strongly bound to the NP surface form the \"hard corona.\" 15,16 Functionally, the PC is characterized by the presence of opsonins (complement proteins), immunoglobulins, and lectins, 17 which match to specific receptors on leukocyte membranes. Until recently, NP opsonization was considered part of the body's defense mechanism by inducing NP clearance from circulation and consequent accumulation in the organs of the mononuclear phagocytic system (mainly spleen and liver). 18 However, in a recent study, unfolded proteins that promote macrophage uptake or their shielding by other proteins in the PC were found to reduce in vitro particle uptake by RAW264.7 macrophages. 19,20 The particular context, therefore, needs to be discussed when considering cellular uptake.",

            "text": "The formation of the protein corona significantly alters the surface characteristics of nanoparticles, thus greatly affecting their interactions with organs and cells. In a recent study, Le ND et al. synthesized a series of poly(\u03b2-amino ester) (PBAE) derivatives and found that the protein corona on nanoparticles could help achieve organ targeting (lungs and spleen) [32]. Interestingly, their findings correlated closely with the study of Min Qiu et al. [33] , which demonstrated that the protein corona on lung-targeted nanoparticles had distinct characteristics that promoted lung accumulation. The protein corona formed on the surface of liposomes is primarily influenced by the physicochemical properties of the liposomes themselves. By selecting different lipid components or varying their ratios, it is possible to achieve targeting of different organs or cells. In 2020, Daniel Siegwart et al. reported a Selective Organ Targeting (SORT) delivery technology [34]. They introduced the cationic lipid DOTAP as a fifth component to the formulation 5A2-SC8/DOPE/DMG-PEG2000/Cholesterol, thereby altering the physicochemical properties of the LNPs, including their zeta potential. This modification influenced the formation of the protein corona during blood circulation, enabling intravenous delivery of mRNA to the lungs. Recently, Daniel Siegwart's team reporting the use of Lung SORT LNPs for delivering ABE mRNA/sgRNA to perform gene editing on lung stem cells, treating pulmonary cystic fibrosis [35]. These findings highlight the complexity and potential of manipulating nanoparticle properties and their protein corona to achieve targeted delivery to specific organs, including the lungs. Therefore, one promising avenue involves the introduction of cationic lipids into the liposomal formulation, which may introduce a more balanced surface charge to achieve lung-targeting. However, the exact mechanisms and optimal strategies require further investigation to enhance the efficacy of lung-targeted liposomal delivery systems. \n\nIn addition, pharmacokinetic experiment was conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetic profiles of PC-Lipo and PS-Lipo in mice. As shown in Fig. 5C, PS-Lipo exhibited a faster metabolic rate compared to PC-Lipo.",

            "text": "So far, most studies on the mechanisms nanoparticles use to enter cells have adopted either serum-free conditions or dispersion in standard cell culture medium supplemented with a low amount of (bovine) serum. Serum is added to cell cultures simply for providing nutrients to cells. However, the presence of biological fluids has much more profound effects on the interactions of nanosized objects with cells, due to the adsorption of molecules on their surface and corona formation. 7 Cell receptors can recognize and engage with such corona proteins, and overall it is known that this layer strongly affects the subsequent interactions with cells. 10 Given that corona proteins can be recognized by specific cell receptors, it comes natural to wonder whether this layer can also affect the mechanisms cells use to internalize nanosized objects. Recent works have shown that the presence or absence of a corona has an impact on the mechanisms cells use to internalize nanosized materials. 64,65 However, it is not known whether the corona composition (as opposed to simply the presence of a corona) also matters. This is of particular importance given that the same nanoparticles can form very different coronas depending on the biological fluid in which they are applied (thus the exposure route or, for nanomedicines, the administration route) and also on its concentration. 7,66 The implications can be profound. For instance, in vivo, nanoparticles in blood encounter much higher serum concentrations than what is usually applied in in vitro studies (passivating nanomedicines by exposure to serum prior to their administration in vivo may be considered in the future as an approach to try to control uncertainties related to changes in corona composition). Indeed, our results suggest that the corona composition can affect the initial recognition by cell receptors and, as a result, the same nanoparticle can be internalized by cells using different mechanisms when different coronas are formed. Potential subtle differences in nanoparticle stability for different coronas could also contribute in part to similar differences and should also be considered.\n\nAnother interesting observation is that nanoparticle uptake is lower at higher serum content. Similar observations were already reported for experiments where the excess proteins were left in situ, 12,67 possibly due to competition with the corona proteins for the same receptors. 10 However, here lower uptake was observed also after corona isolation and removal",

            "text": "One might speculate that the surface association of surfactant proteins and lipids could result in a rather complex mixed corona around nanoparticles upon first contact with pulmonary surfactant. Because surfactant lipids are obviously highly relevant to bio-nano interactions in the lungs, we therefore suggest an expansion of the protein corona theory to include lipids as another essential factor influencing the pulmonary corona. Its detailed characterization is an indispensable issue to address in future investigations. We believe that these findings are of general importance with respect to pulmonary drug delivery and inhalation toxicology. On the one hand, such assimilation might question the hitherto pursued targeting strategies using nanoparticles because surface-ligands meant for cellular recognition could be masked by pulmonary surfactant components and therefore inactivated. On the other hand, the interplay of the surfactant proteins and lipids as a trigger for AM clearance creates a highly effective biological barrier, protecting the human body against potential noxious effects from any kind of inhaled nanomaterials or pathogens.",

            "text": "Different surface charges result in the distinction of serum proteins adsorbed to LNPs, which determines the subsequent organspecific distribution of LNPs 49 . Specifically, positively charged LNPs predominantly accumulate in the lungs of mice, while near-neutral LNPs present a liver accumulation. Therefore, the manipulation of surface charge by LNP formulation emerges as a feasible way to achieve the organ-selective delivery of LNPs. The systematic-selective lipid nanoparticle (Liver-LNPs) system is a classic four-component formulation that consists of cholesterol, 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-choline (DSPC), poly(ethylene glycol) lipids (PEG-lipid), and ionizable lipids (Fig. 3b). The ionizable lipid can be converted into its quaternary ammonium salt form via a simple and effective reaction with methyl iodide to afford a cationic targeting lipid (Fig. 3a). By adding the additional permanently cationic targeting lipid and replacing DSPC with 1,2dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) in the Liver-LNP formulation (Fig. 3b), we successfully obtained lung-selective LNPs (Lung-LNPs), which were capable of precisely delivering mRNA to the lungs. mRNA-loaded LNPs were formed by mixing an aqueous buffer solution containing mRNA and a lipid ethanol solution at the aqueousto-ethanol ratio of 3/1, v/v. Firefly luciferase mRNA (mRNA Luci ) was encapsulated by the two organ-selective LNPs, giving Liver-LNPs@mRNA Luci and Lung-LNPs@mRNA Luci . Both the obtained Liver-LNPs@mRNA Luci and Lung-LNPs@mRNA Luci were uniformly spherical assemblies with a diameter of ~60-100 nm according to the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Fig. 3c).",

            "text": "This work exhaustively illustrates all the possible interaction models and how to analyze the experimental data obtained to have a better understanding of the measured phenomena. Concerning the interactions between nanoparticles and blood components, an interesting study reports the QCM-D characterization of the interactions between a lipid bilayer and carboxylated polystyrene nanoparticles coated with different kinds of protein corona [20]. The study found that the 'soft' protein corona, composed of loosely bounded proteins, induced a permanent alteration in the lipid bilayer structure, while the 'hard' protein corona, composed of strongly bounded proteins, weakly interacted with a lipid bilayer. However, QCM-D is a very versatile technique with which the interactions of nanoparticles have also been studied with other blood components, such as platelets [21] The study of the protein corona is crucial for the development of safe and effective nanoparticles. The QCM-D technique can provide reliable screening of interactions with protein corona-related blood proteins and has been used in several studies to characterize protein corona formation on polymeric nanoparticles. However, the results obtained from QCM-D measurements should be interpreted in the whole context of the specific system under investigation, and other techniques should be used in conjunction with QCM-D to provide a comprehensive characterization of the protein corona. \n\nIn the present work, the QCM-D technique is applied to a rough evaluation of the protein corona formation around poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) nanoparticles. The QCM-D sensors were functionalized with three different blood proteins, namely albumin from human serum (HSA), fibrinogen type I from human plasma (HPF), and \u03b3-globulins from human blood (HBG), and the adhesion of the nanoparticles to the functionalization layers was evaluated. Three nanoparticles with different protein affinities were tested, and the system was validated with dynamic light scattering (DLS) and UV-Vis experiments. This research provides a valid method to characterize the interactions between tested nanoparticles and three blood proteins commonly abundant in the protein corona.",

            "text": "Upon entry into the body, LNPs can interact with proteins in the biological environment and adsorb proteins on the membrane surface to form the protein corona [55,111]. Thus far, it has been demonstrated that the liver-targeting of LNPs is mediated by the absorbed corona proteins, particularly apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which can bind to low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) expressed on hepatocytes and facilitate the uptake of LNP by liver cells [112,113]. In a recent study, Qiu et al. designed a library of O-series LNPs that contained ester bonds in their tails (Figure 4A). They discovered that 306-O12B LNPs tended to deliver Cas9 mRNA and sgRNA to the liver and led to higher Angptl3 gene knockdown compared to DLin-MC3-DMA LNPs (Figure 4B-D). Further studies revealed that the differentiation of tissue targeting might be determined by the corona proteins on the nanoparticle surface [114,115]. \n\nLipid-like nanoparticles (LLNs) represent one of the predominant LNP delivery systems for RNA-based drugs. Dong and colleagues designed a series of LLNs with TT3 as the core structure as depicted in Figure 5A. FTT5 LLNs were formulated to deliver FLuc mRNA in vivo, mediating the highest luminescence signal in the liver (Figure 5B). Subsequently, FTT5 LLNs were utilized to package hFVIII mRNA and adenine base editor mRNA, achieving effective hFVIII protein expression and base editing in vivo of hemophilia A (HA) mice (Figure 5C). Further study showed that FTT5 LLNs with branched ester side chains exhibited greater resistance to degradation compared to FTT9 LLNs with linear chains (Figure 5D) [116]. In an effort to develop biodegradable materials, Zhang et al. rationally designed a series of LLNs with different amines and esters, bearing varied carbon chains as shown in Figure 5E.",

            "text": "The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic which broke out late in 2019 promoted intensive development, rapid marketing and introduction into clinical practice of highly efficient prophylactic vaccines based on lipid nanoparticles (LNP) and the full-length virus spike protein (S-protein) mRNA produced by Moderna [1,2] and Pfizer/BioNTech [3]. These vaccine constructs are supramolecular systems, specifically, nanoparticles consisting of multiple lipid molecules and mRNA molecule(s) (for example, see the reviews [4,5]). The structural and functional roles of lipid molecules consist in facilitating compact packaging of long-chain nucleic acid molecules, protecting them from degradation by extracellular enzymes, providing for the nanoparticle transport into the cell via endocytosis (phagocytosis or pinocytosis) and subsequent mRNA release from the endosome (phagosome) into the cytoplasm for translation and expression of the immunogenic epitope-containing protein. Presumably, mRNA entry into the cytoplasm is a result of LNP-constituting lipids transition to their cationic form under the acidic conditions in the endosome, which promotes their contact with anionic lipids in the periplasmic monolayer of the endosome membrane and further membrane destabilization due to the formation of nonbilayer lipid structures (hexagonal phase) [6]. Taking into account the diversity of func-tions, the lipid platform of mRNA-containing LNPs should include several classes of lipids. The key component is ionizable lipids, which ensure both mRNA packaging during LNP assembly and mRNA release into the cytoplasm. The structures of ionizable lipids in the vaccines produced by both companies are very close, and the protocols for their synthesis are described in the corresponding patents [7][8][9].",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles. The delivery approach that is both most widely used and most clinically advanced is to complex anionic oligonucleotides with cationic lipids thus forming lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) (161)(162)(163). This approach has been especially important for therapeutic use of siRNA (164) and good accounts of current clinical trials using siRNA LNPs are found in recent reviews (10,165). In addition to the cationic lipid, LNPs typically include a neutral lipid such as cholesterol, but a variety of compositions are possible. While simple LNPs are effective as cell culture transfection agents, they cannot be used in vivo because extensive interactions with opsonic proteins in blood lead to rapid clearance by RES phagocytes. LNPs for in vivo use are usually 100-200 nm in size and include a surface coating of a neutral polymer such as PEG to minimize protein binding and uptake by RES cells. This allows greater persistence in the circulation and the opportunity to interact with other cell types. However, because of their size, LNPs can only exit the circulation at sites where the endothelial barrier is fenestrated, particularly liver, spleen and certain tumors having a high EPR effect. Because of this, much of the work with siRNA-LNPs has focused on liver diseases including transthyrethrin-mediated amyloidosis, clotting disorders, liver cancer and disorders of lipid metabolism (11,166). \n\nThe action of LNPs involves initial uptake by endocytosis. In some cases this is mediated by the binding of apolipoprotein E and interaction with the LDL receptor (167). Once in endosomes, the cationic lipids of the LNP interact with anionic membrane lipids to disrupt membrane structure through the formation of a non-bilayer lipid phase termed inverted hexagonal (H II ). This leads both to increased membrane permeability and to dissolution of the LNP and is the basis for conveying the oligonucleotide to the cytosol (168).",

            "text": "For long-distance information transport, exosomes and microvesicles are of interest as vehicles. Exosomes are derived from endosomal compartments named multivesicular bodies (MVBs), whereas microvesicles directly bud from plasma membranes (Th\u00e9ry et al., 2018(Th\u00e9ry et al., , 2002)). During long-distance transport, EVs encounter biological fluids, such as blood, and proteins likely adsorb to their surface. This is referred to as protein corona formation. The adsorbed protein corona can ultimately alter the EV functionality as observed for many nanoparticles. This has been largely neglected in the field of EV research. The formation of an EV protein corona was first described by T\u00f3th et al. who revealed the protein composition as well as demonstrated the influence of a protein corona on EV functionality (T\u00f3th et al., 2021). Shortly after, this was confirmed by Wolf et al. who demonstrated that a protein corona is necessary for EVs to reach their full potential in angiogenesis and wound healing assays (Wolf et al., 2022). These findings started a paradigm shift from viewing plasma-derived proteins as contaminants of EV preparations towards considering them as additional EV components. \n\nPresumably, the insights into the protein corona formed on nanoparticles also will benefit the functional understanding of the EV corona. Nanoparticles quickly adsorb proteins upon contact with biological fluids. This changes their chemical identity to a biological identity and ultimately alters their biodistribution and cell uptake (Walczyk et al., 2010). Distinct proteins regulate the uptake of nanoparticles. Apolipoproteins, a class of lipid-binding proteins abundant in human blood, are known to promote a prolonged blood circulation time by avoiding uptake in phagocytic monocytes of the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS) (Gustafson et al., 2015). This has also been referred to as stealth effect. In contrast, so-called opsonins, such as immunoglobulins mark nanoparticles for uptake in phagocytes (Yang et al., 2013).",

Interestingly, in case of human serum, PF14-pDNA nanoparticles demonstrated higher adsorption of most proteins compared to pDNA alone (Table 5), further emphasizing marked differences in composition of protein corona between sera of various mammals. In addition to fetuin, which marks nanoparticles for recognition by macrophages via scavenger receptors, also \u03b1-2-macroglobulin that is abundant in protein corona of CPP-nucleic acid nanoparticles (Tables 3-5) might dampen the effect of injected pharmaceuticals, like oligonucleotides, targeting these to elimination as found earlier [77].\n\nTo sum up, serum albumin was a prominent constituent in protein corona forming around CPP-nucleic acid nanoparticles in all studied sera: from calf, mouse and human, although from mouse serum it did not associate to nanoparticles with the highest yield. However, the protein composition varied extensively between different sera and each protein corona showed individual pattern.\n\nIn addition, the functioning of proteins forming corona around PF14-pDNA nanoparticles in murine serum is in good concordance with the recent reports about the behaviour and targeting [78] of these nanoparticles in vivo. Accordingly, high level of alpha 1antitrypsin in protein corona of PF14-pDNA nanoparticles (Tables 3-5) correlates well with accumulation of nanoparticles in lungs of mice [79]. It was also shown that accumulation of apolipoprotein B-100, [80] and complement component 3 [78] in protein corona targets nanoparticles to liver. In both these organs high expression of luciferase from pGL3 plasmid was observed recently, whereas only low amounts of these nanoparticles were targeted to spleen, kidney, and heart [55,81].",

For example, a corona can reduce the adhesion of nanoparticles to the cell membrane, which has been shown to reduce cytotoxicity for single wall carbon nanotubes and polystyrene nanoparticles. 28,29 For drug delivery, however, inhibiting nanoparticle internalisation is an undesired effect, as nanoparticles are typically functionalised with receptor-binding molecules.

            "text": "Whether the ionizable lipids play a direct role in endosomal uptake has not been thoroughly investigated. Studies on LNP-siRNA accumulation in the liver show that the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) on hepatocytes mediates the LNP uptake; in apoE-deficient or LDLR-deficient mice, LNP-siRNA do not display the same gene silencing potency [34]. ApoE is an exchangeable apolipoprotein and a ligand for LDLR-mediated uptake of remnant chylomicrons [35]. Consequently, the apoE adsorption on LNPs turn them into biomimicking remanent chylomicrons that are taken up by hepatocytes. This mechanism clearly demonstrates how, rather than being an obstacle, protein (apoE) corona formation on nanomedicines introduced into blood can be exploited for targeting strategies. ApoE adsorption to liposomes does not drive hepatocyte uptake of negatively charged liposomes [36], and hepatocyte uptake of neutral liposomes is >20-fold lower in apoE-deficient mice. Surface charge, including the composition of the protein adsorbed to lipid-based particles, thus plays a role in the clearance mechanism. When using ionizable lipids/LNPs with an apparent pK a of $6.4, about 10% of the ionizable lipids are positively charged in blood (pH 7.4) according to the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The surface charge may not only affect the protein corona composition on nanoparticles but also influence the conformation of the adsorbed proteins, including apoE. Taken together, these inquiries show the interplay between nanomedicines, including LNPs and biomolecules such as apoE in biological fluids, is affected by surface composition, surface charge, and particle size [37]. Such interplay determines the in vivo fate of many nanomedicines. More detailed discussions and recent literature about how size and surface charge affect LNP biodistribution will be presented in Section 5.\n\nThe internalization mechanism of the mRNA-LNP COVID-19 vaccines following intramuscular (",

Cell cholesterol shows little solubility in the nanoparticle core, so it may accumulate crystalline on the surface of LNPs, causing lipid bilayer instability and increasing endosomal escape. In addition, it has a strong membrane fusion ability that is responsible for the intracellular uptake of mRNA and cytoplasmic entry [61]. Cholesterol is also a particle stabilizer in LNP formulations that limits nonspecific LNP protein interactions. It improves fat packaging and modulates the membrane fluidity and permeability of the bilayer membrane system through a condensing effect. Cholesterol also increases the ability of the phospholipid membrane to form a bicontinuous cubic phase at physiological temperatures by mixing with unsaturated phospholipids in a fat transfer system, thereby further increasing melting [36,44,59,61,64,67]. The purpose of lipid nanoparticle-mRNA systems is determined by reaching the target tissues because the target cells must then be internalized, and finally, the mRNA molecules must produce the necessary proteins which must escape the endosomes to reach the cytoplasm somewhere where translation happens [60]. The details of lipid nanoparticle delivery systems for mRNA-based vaccines are noted in Table 2.",

Among them, ionizable lipids are the key components that determine the titer, mRNA delivery efficiency, degradability, and reactivity (Drescher and van Hoogevest, 2020). At low pH, ionizable lipids are protonated in acidic buffers, producing a positive charge and binding to negatively charged mRNA, whereas they remain neutral at physiological pH (Chan et al., 2021;Scalzo et al., 2022). The delivery mechanism of LNPs is shown in Figure 4. Ionizable lipids are less cytotoxic than cationic lipids. This is because the positive charge of cationic lipids typically interacts with negatively charged molecules on the cell surface, leading to cell membrane damage and cell death. In contrast, ionizable lipids can dynamically regulate their charge state in the cellular environment, avoiding the continuous release of positive charges to the cell surface and reducing cytotoxicity (Sharma et al., 2014). In general, PEGbound lipids in LNPs occupy the smallest molar percentage, which can enhance particle stability by affecting charge distribution, size, and dispersion, and hinder LNPs from aggregating, playing a crucial role in blood circulation and biological distribution (Albertsen and Camilla et al., 2022;Kon et al., 2022;Gu\u00e9guen et al., 2023). Structural lipids are chiefly used to support the structure of particles and enhance stability during storage and circulation (Kulkarni et al., 2019;Witzigmann et al., 2020). According to diverse target tissues, the proportions of these four lipid components can be adjusted to change the LNP constitution (Yihunie et al., 2023).",

            "text": "The question about the significance (and role) of a protein corona on different classes of nanoparticles cannot be answered in a \"general sense\". This is not due to an inherent issue with the nanodimensions of the particles. Instead, it arises from the nature of the nanosystem (nanoparticles and plasma proteins, forming a mixed colloidal system) having an especially large surface area. Thus the system is -to some extend-instable [7,9,74] and the deposition of some plasma proteins -with time-on the nanoparticles is \"likely\". As a result, the popular assertion that any nanoparticle forms a protein corona upon contact with blood plasma is generally true for nearly all nanoparticles. However, some nanoparticles designed for nanomedicine applications do not absorb any proteins and, therefore, do not form a protein corona. This occurs for well-understood reasons: the cores of these nanoparticles are coated with a dense layer of strongly hydrated, hydrophilic polymers, which effectively keep plasma proteins away. This is achieved through a combination of a bound water layer and entropic shielding. \n\nThe next question is: How important is the formation of a protein corona. Now, corona formation can be studied, and the results provides certain insights into highly complex systems. Work on this topic accounts for about 1.500 publications up to the middle of 2022. [7] It excludes, however, mostly the question, if corona formation is unavoidable. In our opinion, the real significance of corona formation has to come, however, from the interest to use nanoparticles in the broad field of nanomedicine. And here, the formation of a protein corona -at least in cases, when corona formation is strong-is disadvantageous. That is because nanomedicine wants to use nanoparticles in patients differing -to a certain extend-in serum protein composition. A central idea is thereby to decouple the pharmacological action of an active compound from its body distribution (e.g., to bring drugs into a tumor, or to bring an antigen and adjuvant to immune cells in the skin, spleen or lymph nodes.",

            "text": "Non-specific interactions between nanoparticles and plasma proteins occur when the nanoparticles enter the blood. As a result, coating the original nanoparticles with a protein corona alters the in vivo fate of nanoparticles as well as the biological responses to the nanoparticles. This is one of the substantial reasons for the two main problems associated with nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems, i.e., nanotoxicity and the rapid clearance of nanoparticles from the blood after intravenous injection. A preformed albumin corona has been shown to inhibit plasma proteins such as IgG adsorption, decrease complement activation, reduce the macrophage-related phagocytosis, and ultimately prolong the blood circulation time and reduce the toxicity of the nanoparticles. Furthermore, nanoparticle-albumin complexes show an enhanced bioavailability compared to naked nanoparticles [34].\n\nLiposomes are plagued by rapid opsonization, leading to the shortening of their circulation time in the bloodstream. Interactions between liposomes and plasma proteins have been investigated in order to evaluate the role of liposomal lipid composition and concentration in forming the protein corona. Protein corona formation depends on the presence of PEG, cholesterol, the concentration of the components, and surface charge. Liposomes incorporating 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine lipids and cholesterol both in a molar ratio of 11% were reported to be stable over time, while their size was not altered dramatically in a biological medium. Liposomes containing cholesterol and PEGylated lipids retain their size in the presence of serum as well as their physical stability. Lipid composition and concentration have an effect on the adsorption of proteins and on liposomal stabilization [35].\n\nThe encapsulation of curcumin in a liposome improves its bioavailability and stability, but the short half-life remains an issue. Albumin was used to coat the liposomal curcumin to produce a long-circulating delivery system. Albumin-coated liposomal curcumin particles were more spherical, more homogeneous in size, and significantly larger than liposomal curc",

            "text": "Interestingly, all of these utilizations of barcodes have laid the foundations for creatively and effectively searching for optimal drug delivery systems for mRNA therapeutics based on materials and formulations, and have been actively applied for lipid library screening for extrahepatic targeting until most recent time.However, even proved highly potent in early-stage screening of LNP, barcode-based approach may not guarantee optimal LNP selection for therapeutic mRNA delivery due to following facts: (a) the huge difference in the molecular size between therapeutic mRNA (usually around 2,000 to 5,000 nucleotides) and barcodes (usually around 60 to 100 nucleotides), resulting in diverse physicochemical properties of formulated LNPs, especially un-uniformity in encapsulation efficacy, which plays an essential role in determining the in vitro and in vivo performance of LNP delivery systems, and (b) the small size of the barcode also risks leakage from the LNPs during bench formulation or in the systemic circulation after administration, causing misleading results in tissue distribution and impairing the accuracy for barcode-based LNP selection.Therefore, developing a more stable and representative selection process for high-throughput LNP screening remains highly expected for more accurate acceleration of the translation for LNP-mRNA therapeutics.\n\nAnother aspect related to the in vivo performance of LNP-mRNA remains in the mist.When administrated into the body, nanoparticles absorb various proteins and generate a phenomenon known as the corona effect, as we briefly introduced in the \"Phospholipid and cholesterol\" section.Different LNPs form distinct protein coronas that target different tissues (Fig. 10C).For example, ApoE facilitates liver targeting, vitronectin enhances tumor cell-mediated LNP delivery, and fibrinogen augments LNP targeting to the lungs [96].Consequently, corona adsorption is closely associated with nanocarrier coating and dynamics.In the case of LNPs, PEG length and alkyl chain affect both surface chemistry and PEG shedding rate [67], thereby influencing the surface coronation and targeting tissues.",

            "text": "Protein corona formation is an intrinsic property of nanoparticles that are exposed to biological environments and is often modulated by a nanoparticle's physicochemical properties [160][161][162][163]. Corona composition is dynamic, and protein mobility plays an important role in the desorption/adsorption process. The Vroman effect addresses protein corona formation in materials exposed to a physiological environment and postulates that protein exchange will change corona composition, while the overall quantity of proteins remains roughly the same [163,164]. As reported for many cellular types, the uptake levels and mechanisms of internalization of nanoparticles are affected by the composition of this protein corona [165][166][167][168]. Particle biodistribution and clearance are also significantly influenced by the protein corona. Proteins such as serum albumin, apolipoproteins, fibrinogen, clusterin, and Ig gamma and light chains are commonly found in the protein corona of nanoparticles [163]. Many of these proteins are relatively featureless in terms of targeting; however, some are well-described ligands that cross the BBB via receptormediated transcytosis, e.g., Apo E. There have been promising attempts of controlling the corona formation to improve brain delivery of NPs. For example, Zhang et al. reported the functionalization of PEG-liposomes with a short peptide that binds to the lipid-binding domain of apolipoproteins, leaving the receptor-binding domain available to interact with lipoprotein receptor-related proteins and scavenger receptors class B, which affected intracranial glioma accumulation and notable increases in brain distribution [169]. Even though the protein corona is of interest in brain delivery, it also poses challenges in the investigation of particle properties [170][171][172]. \n\nCoating nanoparticles with molecules that avoid protein adsorption is a broadly implemented strategy in nanotherapeutic systems, and PEGylation is the most common approach.",

            "text": "LNPs also facilitate mRNA delivery to the spleen via a \u03b22-GPI-mediated endogenous targeting mechanism [116,194]. However, a recent study assessed the changes of protein coronas on mRNA-LNP surface accumulated in spleen after repeated administration, and the result was the enrichment of immunoglobulins [188]. It suggests that immunoglobulins also play an important role in the protein coronas on spleen-targeting LNP surface. Whether the protein coronas act together or promote spleen targeting independently remains inconclusive. Negative charge on LNP surface increased the spleen targeting ability of LNPs. Kranz et al. [41] used DOTMA (cationic lipid) and DOPE (helper lipid) to form mRNA-Lipoprotein X (LpX)s. It was observed that mRNA-LpXs with a zeta potential around \u2212 35 mV generated a signal exclusively in the spleen, with no significant expression observed in the liver. LoPresti et al. \n\n[141] used phosphatidylserine as helper lipids, maintaining a four-component LNP system. The surface of these mRNA-LNPs displayed a weak negative surface charge, thus reproducing the same spleen tropism. \n\nFurthermore, the structures of ionizable lipids affect the protein expression of mRNA in the spleen. Fenton et al. developed an ionizable lipid OF-Deg-Lin containing biodegradable ester bonds (Fig. 12B) [189,196]. Although the mRNA-LNPs composed of OF-Deg-Lin accumulated stronger in the liver than in the spleen, the mRNA  [192] expression in the spleen was over 85% while being hardly expressed in the liver. The reason might be that the ester bond degraded quickly in the liver before inducing protein expression in the hepatocytes (e.g., during cell internalization). Conversely, OF-Deg-Lin-LNPs might have been preserved in the spleen, retaining their ability to generate functional protein expression following uptake in the resident splenic cells.",

For example, there are a number of studies describing the multiple protein binding to silica nanoparticles in complex protein mixtures, 5,10,11,[13][14][15] whereas another recent study reports that in human blood plasma a single protein is dominating when the particle surface area is scarce. 11 An alternative view of the formation of the corona is that biomolecules stochastically adsorb irreversibly to the nanoparticle surface. 16 It is likely that the nature of the nanoparticle surface determines which process dominates and that on some surfaces a combination of different processes occurs. However, very little is known about correlations between simultaneously occurring molecular adsorption processes and specific nanoparticle descriptors such as size and shape because real time corona formation studies are experimentally very difficult. \n\nCommonly, when the corona formed in blood serum or plasma is studied, nanomaterials (often in the form of particles) are incubated in biological media. The formed complexes of the nanomaterial with adsorbed proteins, lipids or other biomolecules, are separated from unbound biomolecules (e.g. by centrifugation), and characterized (e.g. by mass spectrometry or gel electrophoresis).",

The apolipoprotein classes and quantities were also varied among PEC protein coronas. Previous studies demonstrated that the interplay of different parameters including nanoparticle surface chemistry, incubation condition, and serum protein physicochemical properties such as protein Mw, size, electrostatic charge, and chemical composition dictate the protein corona identity 48 . The interaction of proteins with nanoparticles occurs by covalent and non-covalent bonds. Herein, the studied PECs have negative zeta potential due to the neutralizing of Ch in serum condition with pH >6.5 and negative charge of dextran. Hemoglobin possesses the positive charge in serum condition and was adsorbed to the negative charge PECs. Furthermore it could be attached to the thiolated PECs via disulfide bonds between cysteine residues 46 . Apo-lipoproteins which are amphipathic molecules could also absorb on PECs. They are small proteins with negative charge in serum and bind to the lipid particles. Saha et al. demonstrated that levels of lipoproteins in protein corona depends on chemistry of nanoparticle surface as it decreased on functionalized gold nanoparticles in 10% FBS medium following increasing the hydrophobicity of nanoparticle surface 41 . Protein C which is a glycoprotein also dominantly covered the PECs. The surface of particles consists of large number of carboxyl, amine, hydroxyl and thiol (in case of using TD in PEC structure) groups that involve in interactions with protein functional moieties. Although albumin has the most percentage in serum, we assume that the mentioned proteins have more affinity to the PEC functional groups. \n\nMoreover, the interaction of the specific proteins can affect the biodistribution, clearance, and uptake of the nanoparticles by macrophages and target cells 49,50 .",

            "text": "The term \"nanoparticles\" (NPs) refers to various types of particulate materials with one dimension of a size smaller than 100 nm [1,2]. They are increasingly popular for use as drug delivery systems to overcome classical problems faced by most drugs such as low solubility [3,4], low bioavailability [5,6], non-specificity [7,8], and/or toxicity [9,10]. Therefore, each year there is an increasing trend of NP-based therapies being approved by governmental medicine regulatory agencies such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [11,12] or the European Medicines Agency (EMA) [13,14]. However, even though many NP systems were designed to evade drug delivery-related problems, some types of NPs face unexpected challenges in vivo which can potentially lower their therapeutic effectiveness [15,16]. \n\nThe term \"nano-bio-interactions\" is used to describe the various ways in which NPs interact with the body. These interactions can be categorized based on the organs which the NPs interact with, such as NP-liver interactions [17], NP-kidney interactions [18], NP-brain interactions [19], NP-tumor interactions [20], and other non-specific NP interactions [21]. When NPs are injected, the first interaction occurs when serum proteins circulating in the blood attach themselves onto the surface of the NP, forming what is known as a protein corona [22,23]. The characteristics of the corona formed will depend on the physical and chemical characteristics of the NP, such as its size, charge, and shape, which are discussed in more detail below. \n\nThe particles then circulate around the body in the bloodstream. Their biodistribution and other nano-bio-interactions are affected by their protein corona [24,25]. In some cases, the corona configuration can cause most of the NPs to be sequestered by the reticuloendothelial system (RES). This leads to their biodistribution mainly accumulating in the liver and spleen [26,27], which could lower their therapeutic effectiveness.",

            "text": "The purpose of our publication \"Multiomics analysis of naturally efficacious lipid nanoparticle coronas reveals high-density lipoprotein is necessary for their function\" 1 was to elucidate why plasma from obese rats seemed to improve the function of therapeutic lipid nanoparticles (LNP), and use this knowledge to suggest how LNPs might be improved. A comprehensive proteomic analysis revealed that there is a correlation between LNP coronal content, from different individual animals and, LNP function in those same individuals. More effective LNPs tended to have coronal proteomic signatures consistent with increased HDL content. We validated this by creating HDL-augmented coronas artificially and found that these do indeed lead to improved LNP function both in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we conclude that measuring LNP association with certain coronal elements, notably with the HDL component ApoM, is a good predictor for LNP efficacy. \n\nThe Matters Arising from Simonsen questions whether the pulldown method we proposed \"avoids the co-isolation of lipoproteins and EVs\". We are fully aware of potential lipoprotein and EV contamination in existing LNP corona isolation methods and this was discussed in the original publication 1 . We included multiple controls and validation experiments to ensure that any eventual contaminants do not affect our conclusions. We believe that these efforts contribute significantly to advancing our understanding of LNP coronas and other nanosized particles in complex biological systems. \n\nSeveral techniques are available to isolate LNPs from biofluids. Density centrifugation, size exclusion chromatography, flow fractionation and pull-down assays may be used. Unfortunately, most of these are relatively slow, require large sample volumes, produce variable results or, they are difficult to parallelize. Systematic exploration of the relationship between LNP composition, LNP coronal content and biofluids from individual animals requires high throughput and speed, good reproducibility and, compatibility with laboratory automation systems. We found that only the pull-down method met these criteria, allowing us to make the large-scale comparisons necessary to see patterns, and to do this quickly enough that the composition of the fragile, metastable coronas can be preserved.",

ROS reactive oxygen species, IONPs iron oxide nanoparticles agglomeration and NET formation [95]. The nanoparticles that follow direct translocation paths may break the cell plasma membrane by interacting with the lipid bilayer molecules that transport them directly into the cytoplasm [90]. Therefore, using the cell-penetrating peptides as nanoparticle surface ligands is an alternative technique [99]. When IONPs are inserted into living organisms and encounter biological fluids, their surface immediately interacts with proteins and other macromolecules, producing a \"protein corona\" that can radically affect the aggregation state, nanomaterial size, and interfacial characteristics, thus influencing the uncontrollable biological behavior of IONPs [100]. Thus, this protein corona is primarily responsible for IONP disposition and is involved in slowing the nanoparticle degradation process [101]. However, significant deviations in IONPs with a corona produced from human plasma were detected as a function of the lipid adsorption profile [102]. IONPs were reported to be associated with inflammation and pulmonary oxidative stress [103]. Severe exposure of lung epithelial cells to IONPs may modify the cell biomechanical properties and potentially impairing the integrity of the epithelial barrier [28].",

            "text": "In an in vitro toxicity assay, the cell culture medium contains protein serum and a similar corona formation is expected. Some studies have described the effect of serum on nanomaterial toxicity [14,19,25,35,[40][41][42]. Corona formation was found to affect hemolysis, thrombocyte activation, nanoparticle uptake and endothelial cell death [19]. When in contact with a biological environment, the protein corona confers on NPs a new bioidentity. Some of the proteins in this corona can be recognized by specific cell membrane receptors, triggering internalization mechanisms that are different to those generated by pristine NPs [40]. Once inside cells, NPs may cause adverse effects and permanent cell damage. Mechanisms including oxidative stress, inflammation, genetic instability, and the inhibition of correct cell division may be involved and may contribute to cell death [5]. \n\nIn this context, hepatic HepG2 cells were exposed to three different concentrations of pristine M-MSNs. A dose-dependent response of the HepG2 cell index was observed with exposure to pristine nanoparticles (Fig 4). HepG2 cells were then exposed to M-MSNs covered with coronas of two different species origins, each at two different concentrations (Fig 5). M-MSNs covered with bovine proteins induced similar effects to pristine NPs at both doses tested 50 \u03bcg/ mL (Fig 5A ) and 100 \u03bcg/mL (Fig 5B). This result is related to the kinetics of corona formation [18,23,36]. Indeed, corona formation begins as soon as NPs are in contact with the proteins contained in the culture medium. We have previously shown that after 30 seconds the corona has already formed around the NP [18]. Thus, by the time the nanoparticles and cells come into contact, the corona has already formed around the pristine M-MSNs, producing similar effects to those elicited by a 24-hour preformed FBS corona. The formation of the corona occurs within the first minutes. [18,19].",

            "text": "recently been used as immunomodulators, enzyme inhibitors, and transporters of therapeutic proteins. These new applications are associated with the protein-nanoparticle interaction, a phenomenon termed as \"protein corona.\" The layer of proteins adsorbed on NPs functions as a biological module in vivo and is difficult to understand at the level of a single protein. The process underlying corona formation is complicated and involves complex kinetics and dynamics. Thus, the in vivo behavior of NPs relies on protein corona formation, which defines the biological activity or toxicity of NPs. Protein corona formation is highly diverse depending on the sources and/or production methods of NP systems, including metals, metal oxides, polymers, composites, and CNTs. For example, gold nanoparticles affected albumin in the circulating system, 17 while those produced by enzymatic method showed binding to cellular RNAs and proteins. 18 Caseincoated gold NP can translocate across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), resulting in corona formation with Abeta42. 19 Magnesium oxide (MgO) NPs spontaneously form an albumin complex upon introduction, 20 while MgO NPs produced through green synthesis can also interact with cellular proteins such as superoxide dismutase 1 (Sod1) and p53 after internalization into cells. 21 Regarding protein corona formation, the structural changes in proteins on NPs should be noted and studied to enhance the in vivo availability of NPs. The correct structure of the protein is necessary for its proper function. Various biological systems, including chaperons, proteasome, autophagy, and ER-associated degradation monitor the quality of the protein structure and tightly regulate the fate of proteins in cells depending on their conformational state. 22 Uncontrolled disruption of the folding pathway can lead to disease onset. For example, the unfolding or misfolding of proteins is directly related to amyloid-associated diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, [23][24][25] Parkinson's disease, 26,27 type 2 diabetes, 28 and familial amyloidosis. 29,30 The immunoglobulin light-chain in the blood stream occasionally forms aggregates, accumulates at various sites, and causes a significant problem in the body, which may be due to",

            "text": "The physicochemical properties of the protein corona and its evolution with time have been shown to affect the behavior of nanoparticles in biological environments to a large extent [1,11,28,162]. Our current understanding suggests that initially a \"soft\" protein corona, with a highly dynamic exchange of proteins, is formed around NPs. Changing its composition over time, the \"soft\" corona slowly evolves to a \"hard\" corona with less dynamic exchange [112,162,163]. Previous studies investigating nanomaterial exposure to complex biological environments [3,8,41,112,162] have largely failed to allow for the highly dynamic situation of physiological systems. Coronacarrying NPs may need to instantly react to external stimuli under such conditions as exemplified by considering the blood system where processes controlling haemostasis and thrombosis may be triggered on a timescale of minutes [28]. \n\nTenzer and co-workers [10] recently developed a new experimental approach allowing for a time-resolved determination of NP-specific fingerprints. This method, based on label-free liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS), allows for an insight into the time-evolution of the full serum protein corona. Such information, especially for short exposure times, is urgently needed to understand the interactions between NPs and biological systems. Briefly, they used their LC-MS based method to measure time-resolved corona compositions on silica and polystyrene NPs in human serum. By using NPs of various sizes (diameters of about 35, 120, 140 nm), and surface functionalities (amine, carboxylate, unmodified), they were able to provide insights into the consequences of these factors for corona composition and dynamics. \n\nThey demonstrated in their study that coronas were formed very rapidly, and showed an unexpected complexity regarding composition and dynamics on all of the NPs under investigation. They quantitatively detected 166 different plasma proteins within the corona after 0.5 min. The number of individual proteins quantified in the corona increased to almost 300 on the different types of NPs at prolonged exposure times (up to 480 min).",

In the same cell model but using a different cationic lipid to formulate the LNP, Sahay et al. reported that downregulation of Cdc42 and Rac1 led to 80% decrease in LNP uptake, whereas inhibition of clathrin heavy chain-1 and caveolin-1 had little impact on LNP entry. 205 Together, these studies highlight areas in the design of LNP, which need further optimization and understanding to achieve efficient intracellular delivery.\n\nSince LNP delivery efficiency is influenced by the formation of a protein corona in biological media, one may expect that a healthy individual or a patient suffering of a pathology affecting the serum composition, will have different serum-protein diversity and concentration which could possibly affect the protein-corona composition of LNP and thus alter their activity in vivo, as observed for PLGA nanoparticles. 206 In addition, it is important to note that lipid self-assembly and therefore LNP morphology is driven by biophysical parameters including composition, temperature, pressure, electrostatics and lipid packing which have already been extensively reviewed and are therefore not addressed here. 207\u2212209 Therefore, the morphology and functional response of an RNA-LNP system administrated into a patient with abnormal body temperature (e.g., fever or low-body-temperature-related syndrome) may differ (e.g., protein-corona formation and delivery efficiency) when compared to a healthy volunteer. To date, LNPs have shown efficient delivery of RNA to the liver using passive cellular targeting (size control and protein adsorption). Compositional variations in LNPs have been demonstrated to enhance LNP accumulation in the lung and spleen; 210 however, delivery to other organs remains challenging. Like liposomal systems, LNPs can take advantage of \"natural\" and synthetic targeting processes to actively reach specific tissues and cells. The main strategies rely on proteins, peptides or natural ligands, antibodies or antibody fragments, as well as aptamers. Antibody-mediated targeting has demonstrated success in gene-silencing with LNP systems. As an example, Rameshetti et al. used an anti-CD4",

            "text": "Understanding the mRNA loading mechanism and biobarriers helps us to identify the useful groups in carriers. However, the specific delivery of mRNA to tissues and cells in vivo remains a significant challenge. 98 Much research has reported the complicated interactions between nanoparticles and cells, as such information is key to rationally designing particles for biological applications, which may determine the cellular uptake leading to the specific accumulation. It was reported that the surface charge of LNPs at physiological pH can influence their plasma protein adsorption and in vivo behavior (e.g., tissue distribution). 14,98 A classic example is apolipoprotein E (ApoE), generally recognized as an endogenous ligand targeted to the liver. 99 One explanation is that the neutral surface vehicle will absorb more ApoE, resulting in a stronger tendency to distribute in the liver. 100 The dissociation constant (pK a ) that determines the surface charge of LNPs at different pH is one of the important factors to consider when designing ionizable lipids. Other pieces of evidence also suggest that surface charge has an impact on the targeting ability of LNPs: the inclusion of neutral ionizable lipids enhanced liver targeting, anionic lipids resulted in retargeting of delivery to the spleen, and permanently cationic lipids bearing a quaternary ammonium headgroup specifically deliver mRNA to lung. 101,102 Interestingly, the above two nonliver targeting effects occur independently of ApoE, which suggests that there is a correlation between the components of protein corona and surface charges of nanoparticles, resulting in the differences in the tissue-targeted ability 103 . 104 recent study found that LNPs prepared with the structurally similar ionizable lipids 306-O12B and 306-N16B showed slight negative charges without significant differences. 105 However, 306-O12B containing the ester linker led to liver targeting, while 306-N16B with an amide linker tended to lung targeting. Compared with ester bonds, amides tend to combine with proteins via hydrogen bonds. 106 Thus, the protein corona coating in 306-N16B LNPs is completely different from that in 306-O16B LNPs, which has been proven. 105",

            "text": "systems. This phenomenon could be explained by the differences in the chemical structure and spatial arrangement of the two polymers within the lipid nano-carriers. Namely, in the samples covered with PEG2000-DSPE, PEG groups are anchored to a phospholipid tail (DSPE), which is aligned parallel within the membrane phospholipid molecules of the formulations, allowing for the hydrophilic PEG chains to extend outward. This configuration was shown to decrease the surface hydrophobicity, and therefore reduce the plasma protein adsorption [21]. On the other hand, the large hydrophobic polypropylene oxide block of Poloxamer was probably positioned deeper and closer to the lipid layer of the NLs and NLCs, thereby limiting the degree to which the PEG chains were projected and extended on the surface of the nano-formulations [29].\n\nAccording to the literature data, upon the intravenous administration of nanoparticles in vivo, the adherence of serum biomolecules on the nanoparticles' surfaces could result in particle integrity loss and severely alter the particle properties, which has a major influence on their key performances, including their aggregation behavior, circulation time in vivo, toxicity, and targeting capability [27]. In this sense, the change in the particle diameter during the incubation in human plasma may have been due to the destabilization of the system in terms of particle agglomeration, or, more likely, the formation of a protein corona [28]. This phenomenon could be observed at the first time points of the incubation of the formulations, which points to the dynamic process of protein corona formation, i.e., the constant adsorption and desorption of proteins from the particles' surfaces, which is especially emphasized during the formation of the initial, \"soft\" corona [30]. except for NLCPOL, where there was noted a significant change in the z-average diameter after 24 h of incubation time (p = 0.0101; p < 0.05; ANOVA) ( Figure 2a). Similar values for the nano-systems' average diameters were obtained when they were incubated in human plasma, except with NLCPOL, where, after 24 h, there was an increase in particle size of ~",

Since COVID-19 infection is associated with aberrant coagulation cascade, resulting in serious alteration of coagulating factors and other mediators, timely detection of rising levels of complement proteins, immunoglobulins, and clotting factors in blood plasma could provide the information necessary for clinicians to choose the right strategy (e.g., appropriate dosing of blood-thinning medications) and aggressiveness of treatment to prevent the lethal consequences of massive blood clotting such as heart and/or brain strokes. \n\nAnalysis of the biomolecular/protein corona profiles of many nanoparticles (e.g., silica, 107 polystyrene, 107 and gold 58 ) has revealed the capacity of the corona in absorption of complement proteins, immunoglobulins, and/or coagulants, which can be extremely helpful for detection of sudden increases in the abundance of these proteins in blood plasma. We have shown that precoating of nanoparticles with specific proteins (e.g., immunoglobulins) can significantly improve the recruitment of similar proteins from blood plasma. 108 Therefore, precoating nanoparticles with clot-related proteins such as fibrinogen, fibrin, factor VIII, factor XIII, tissue plasminogen activator, or protein Z could significantly intensify the recruitment of similar proteins into the corona, creating a unique opportunity for the development of a sensitive and robust approach for rapid identification of even subtle signs of clotting in plasma. These protein-enriched coronas can be detected through welldeveloped colorimetric sensing platforms, including smartphone-readable systems for detection and discrimination of multiple proteins. 109 In addition, well-designed (opto)plasmonic nanoparticles 110 /nanosensors 111 (e.g., gold 110,112 ) may identify changes in the secretion of blood-clotting proteins by generating colored solutions amenable to detection with the naked eye or point-of-care devices.",

Even in the case of viruses, the known composition of certain virions facilitates identification of corona proteins derived from the mammalian host. The difficulty of EV corona analysis is that both the corona and the EV proteins are derived from the same host organism. In addition, EVs are heterogeneous, therefore identifying which molecules belong to the protein corona and which are components of EVs proves to be challenging. Although the protein composition of separated plasma EVs has been already compared with published proteomic datasets of both EV preparations and artificial nanoparticle coronas, and based on this, the existence of a protein corona around EVs has already been proposed (Palviainen et al., 2020), no direct experimental evidence has been provided so far about the formation of an EV protein corona.\n\nHere we used the approach to harvest nascent EVs from serum-free conditioned medium of THP1 cells and Optiprep-purified platelets and to incubate these vesicles in EVDP samples. Our MS results obtained after dC, SEC or DGUC provided evidence for the presence of EV-associated proteins. The corona was also detectable by Wes, confocal microscopy, transmission and immune EM and was also reflected by an increased floatation density of 'coated EVs' . Some of the corona proteins could be dissociated from the EV surface in the presence of high salt solution suggesting electrostatic interactions in the corona formation.\n\nWe next compared published datasets of protein coronas formed in human blood plasma around viruses (such as HSV and RSV) and lipid nanoparticles (of the size of approx. 200 nm) with our THP1 and platelet EV data. One of the most exciting results of this study was that we found nine proteins that were present in all six datasets (THP1 and platelet mEVs, HSV, RSV, positively and negatively charged lipid nanoparticles). Furthermore, these nine proteins were also detected in several other previous studies on artificial nanoparticles (Br\u00fcckner et al., 2020;Di Santo et al., 2020;Digiacomo et al., 2020;Giulimondi et al., 2019;Papafilippou et al., 2020;",

            "text": "The experimental and theoretical studies have revealed that protein corona influences conformations and surface properties of nanoparticles and their interactions with cell membranes, although those mechanisms have not been well understood at the atomic scale. As computer power and force-field development have advanced, MD simulations have provided considerable useful information regarding the formation of protein corona and its effect on nanoparticle properties and the nanoparticle-membrane binding for the past decade. In particular, MD simulations have been able to explore the competitive adsorption and desorption of plasma proteins on differently sized and charged nanoparticles, which helps to explain the experimental results and the Vroman effect. \n\nAlthough MD simulations have captured the experimental observations of corona formation and its interactions with nanoparticles and membranes, there are still differences in environments and mass transport conditions of experiments and simulations, which precludes any quantitative comparison between the two. For instance, there are hundreds of plasma proteins that compete with each other and form protein corona on nanoparticle surfaces. Additionally, the flowing velocity of bloodstream may modulate protein-protein and protein-nanoparticle interactions. Cell membranes consist of various membrane proteins and lipids, and their components and ratios vary in different cells. Filaments of cytoskeleton influence the membrane shape and mechanical resistance and, thus, may modulate the protein-membrane interaction. These details should be considered to predict the adsorption kinetics and final composition of protein corona for drug delivery applications, which are expected to be resolved in the future by recent efforts in developing multiscale-simulation methodologies and realistic cell-membrane models. Despite these limitations, MD simulations have successfully interpreted the Vroman effect and experimental observations at the atomic scale, clearly indicating a promising tool for the rational design of highly efficient drug delivery systems.

            "text": "Magnetic nanoparticles (MNP) are interesting tools for a variety of applications for diagnosis and therapy in medicine [1,2]. Prominent examples are magnetic drug targeting [3,4], magnetic particle hyperthermia [5,6] or magnetic particle imaging [7,8]. For this purpose, aqueous MNP dispersions (ferrofluids) have to be administered to the body, which requires a reliable sterilization of the ferrofluids to exclude any risk for the patient from pathogens within the fluid. Typically, this sterilization is performed by exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation or autoclaving [9]. \n\nWhen injecting MNP into a biological system (e.g., the peripheral blood of a patient), a layer made of different proteins present in the biological system (serving as a protein source) is formed on the surface of the MNP-the so-called protein corona [10,11]. This protein layer of a few nanometers [12] can be divided into a peripheral soft corona and a hard corona on the interface to the particles [13,14]. In our previous investigations [15,16] we could demonstrate that the formation of the corona occurs within seconds and the corona composition is furthermore influenced by the temperature at which corona formation takes place, as well as the duration of particle-protein interaction. It should be recalled here that for most engineered nanoparticles, their dilution in biological fluids (such as peripheral blood or fetal bovine serum) leads to particle aggregation [17][18][19]. It is also known that different particle properties (e.g., size and surface charge) exhibit an influence on protein corona formation and the resulting corona composition [20][21][22]. Furthermore, the protein corona plays a crucial role for the biological fate of the particles within the body [22][23][24]. The protein corona affects the cellular uptake profoundly and has an impact on the cell response, for example, cytotoxicity [25][26][27][28].",

The most tightly NP-bound proteins form the so-called hard corona (HC), the key bio-entity that determines the NP's biological identity and physiological response. To date, NP-HC has been almost exclusively characterized in vitro, while NP\u2013protein interactions under realistic in vivo conditions remain largely unexplored. In this study, we thoroughly characterized the in vivo HC of a NP formulation that forms around lipid nanoparticles with a lipid composition equal to that of clinically used liposomal amphotericin B (AmBisome\u00ae) after the recovery of the NPs from the blood circulation of FVB/N mice 10 minutes post intravenous administration. In vitro HC formed by 10 minutes incubation of NPs in FVB/N mouse plasma was used for comparison. Here we show that the biological identity (i.e. size, zeta-potential and aggregation state) of NPs in vivo is significantly different from that acquired in vitro. Furthermore, the variety of protein species in the in vivo HC was considerably larger. The present work has demonstrated that characterization of the in vivo HC is essential to provide an accurate molecular description of the biological identity of NPs in physiological environments.",

Currently, LNPs are a popular strategy being explored for various diseases and applications (Chernikov et al., 2019), mostly attributable to the success of the mRNA-based vaccines against COVID-19. The LNPs are mainly composed of four components: Cationic or ionizable lipid (IL), cholesterol, helper lipid, and PEGylated lipid (Ly et al., 2022). Figure 4 represents the key constituents of LNPs. The cationic or ILs (also known as pH-sensitive lipids) interact with RNA molecules through electrostatic interaction between amine and phosphate groups. The interactions mediate the cellular internalization of nanoparticles along with siRNA and their release in the cytoplasm (Jayaraman et al., 2012;Lee et al., 2022).",

The precise rules of surface-protein adsorption remain unknown, although the surface charge and topography of the nanoparticle seem to discriminate the different coronas. We will describe examples of adsorption of specific biomolecules onto nanoparticles as one of the methods for natural surface functionalization, and highlight advantages and limitations.

Proteins quickly coated the surface of the original MWCNT and MWCNT-COOH and made them more compact than MWCNT-PEG, and these compact forms were more effective in protecting cells from the MWCNT surface. Further investigation showed that hydrophobicity was the main reason for the increase in the cellular uptake of the original MWCNTs. However, the protein corona filled with dysoposnins was the major reason for the low uptake of MWCNT-COOH in RAW264.7 cells. The protein corona on MWCNT reduced the exposure of the surface to the medium and limited interactions with cells. As a result, fewer ROS or inflammatory cytokines were produced. Hence, protein binding played a key role in reducing toxicity (Zhang et al., 2019). \n\nSome studies have also shown that the number and types of proteins adsorbed on the surface of NPs are closely related to the properties of NPs. Li et al. synthesised several NPs with similar shapes, sizes, and surface characteristics but different elasticity (45 kPa-760 MPa). After mixing these NPs with mouse plasma, they found that the composition of the protein corona formation changed non-monotonically with the increase in the elasticity of the NPs (Li et al., 2022). For example, apolipoprotein AI was more likely to form the corona protein over NPs of intermediate elasticity (75-700 kPa). Cheng et al. found that changing the components of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) can make LNPs absorb specific proteins in the blood and target specific organs (Cheng et al., 2020). \n\nThe research team undertook a study to ascertain the relationship between the ligand-protein corona and its biological effects, utilizing Pearson's correlation coefficient analysis. They delved into the impact of the protein corona on how particles are internalised and the subsequent macrophage immune response. \n\nTheir findings revealed that the surface chemistry of AuNRs played a role in determining the protein corona's composition.",

In 328 particular, Apo A-II, B, C-II, and C-IV, the structural proteins found in HDL, VLDL, and 329 chylomicron (CM) lipoproteins, were positively correlated with LNPs performance. Apo M, which 330 is found primarily on HDL 46 , also exhibited a high positive correlation to LNP performance. In 331 contrast, Apo E and Apo A-IV 47 , which are primarily found in VLDL and CM demonstrated a 332 moderate negative correlation to LNPs performance (Fig. 5a). While Apo E is often considered 333 highly correlative to LNP hepatic delivery efficacy, the amount of corona Apo E in obese-plasma-334 derived coronas declined modestly compared to lean-derived counterparts ( Supplementary Fig.  335 14). Remarkably, quantitative imaging revealed that LNPs stimulated higher cellular eGFP mRNA 336 expression when supplemented with obese plasmas that resulted in coronas with less ApoE (Fig.  337 1e). As will be shown later, this is also not simply because the obese serum stimulates protein 338 production, but rather that specific plasma components accumulate in LNP coronas and this leads 339 to enhanced LNP function. 340\n\nWhile not all protein components of LNP coronas are strongly correlated with LNP function, the 341 majority of lipids associated with LNPs did correlate with enhanced LNP performance.

Due to their attractive surface charges, the proteins can be electrostatically adsorbed on the surface of nanocarriers, which is known as protein corona, hereby changing the nanocarriers' surface properties, covering the targeting moieties and finally impacting cellular uptake. 22 Therefore, the effect of the protein corona was studied in terms of toxicity, uptake and protein pattern as well as protein identification to understand the uptake behavior, as shown in Figures 4 and 5. SiNCs were incubated with human serum (HS) prior to adding them to CD8 + T-cells in medium containing different percentages of HS. The results indicate that the protein corona reduced the toxicity for all SiNCs compared to uncoated NCs ( Figure 4A). It was also found that the medium containing a higher percentage of HS contributed to enhancement of cell viability similar to previous study. 25 However, the uptake was dramatically decreased in all cases compared to the uncoated NCs, together with increasing of %HS in the medium, especially at 10% HS ( Figure 4B). These results suggest that the uptake of SiNCs in CD8 + T-cells was inhibited by the adsorbed protein forming protein corona, which can be observed from the pre-coated NCs. In addition, the different concentrations of serum might result in differences in corona composition leading to a decreased uptake with increasing  serum concentration. For gold nanoparticles, it was found that the corona inhibited caveolae-mediated endocytosis resulting in decreased uptake in human epidermal keratinocytes. 40 After forming the protein corona, the physicochemical properties of SiNCs were analyzed. Overall, the hydrodynamic size increased for all SiNCs (Table S1, Supporting Information). The \u03b6-potential after corona was about \u221220 mV for NCs as the surface was saturated with a high amount of adsorbed proteins (Table S1, Supporting Information).

            "text": "Therefore, an enormous effort is put in investigating the processes mediating nanoparticle interaction with body fluids and cells. Various literature describes that after intravenous injection nanoparticles rapidly interact with diverse blood components like immunoglobulins, bloodclotting factors, and complement proteins, forming a socalled protein corona [27,[55][56][57][58][59][60][61]. The so built corona can be subdivided in a hard corona formed by proteins with strong binding affinity to the nanoparticles' surface like immunoglobulins and apolipoproteins and the soft corona, which builds the outer layer of the corona, and is dominated by weakly bound proteins for example albumin [59,60,62,63]. The whole process is also referred to as opsonization that only then enables recognition by and interaction with phagocytic cells [26,27,55,64]. Probably this is exactly what happened to the nanoparticles used in this study and explains the rapid accumulation in liver and spleen. However, the significantly higher uptake of the nanoparticles at the magnetic implant is a clear proof-of-concept, and with a much longer circulation time one can assume a further increasing accumulation. \n\nBy implementing a range of methods like size-exclusion chromatography gel filtration, isothermal titration calorimetry and surface plasmon resonance studies, Cedervall et al. gained a deeper understanding of the nanoparticle protein interaction [65]. They found that protein adsorption is strongly dependent on the particle surface characteristics and size but on protein identity as well. Especially, surface hydrophobicity plays a major role [65]. A more recent study investigated the protein adsorption on different types of mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) using 10% and 100% fetal calf serum (FCS) focusing on the hard corona [66]. The most important finding of this study was that surface functionality, particle type, pore size, surface roughness and incubation time had a lesser influence on the extent of protein adsorption to the particles than the serum concentration.",

            "text": "We initially determined that PLGA nanoparticles enter the body as foreign objects, triggering an in ammatory response in ApoE \u2212/\u2212 mice. These nanoparticles were then engulfed by macrophages, migrated to sites of in ammation and eventually aggravated the formation of plaque. \n\nDuring the injection process, nanoparticles are rapidly coated with macromolecules forming a \"protein crown or corona (PC)\", which alters the size, aggregation state, surface charge and interfacial properties of the nanomaterials to create a biological identity that is distinct from its original synthetic identity. PLGA nanoparticles adsorbed a certain amount of proteins to form the PLGA + PC, with larger diameter and less stability, after incubation with mouse serum. Nanoparticles with protein coronas show completely different cell recognition or biological effects in vitro compared with in vivo [30] . \n\nMacrophages are the most important in ammatory cells in the process of AS lesion formation, are important components of lipid plaques, and serve as an important source of foam cells [40] . Therefore, we studied the effects of PLGA nanoparticles on macrophages in vitro. According to the MTS assay results, the activity of Raw 264.7 cells decreased with increasing concentrations of PLGA nanoparticles and PLGA + PC. The presence of the protein corona inhibited the phagocytosis of PLGA nanoparticles by Raw 264.7 cells. Studies have shown that the role of the protein corona in biological systems can be divided into \"opsonins\" and \"dysopsonins\" [41] . Opsonins promote macrophage phagocytosis, while dysopsonins inhibit phagocytosis. The structure and composition of the corona depend on the synthetic identity of the nanomaterial, which includes the chemistry, topography and curvature of the nanomaterial. Polymer nanoparticles possess various chemical compositions, free residues and morphologies (such as spheres, rods, vesicles, tubules and lamellae), which provide them with more diverse synthetic identities. After PLGA nanoparticles enter the blood stream, the surface-adsorbed dysopsonins may be more abundant and more stable.",

The analysis of the hard corona, which involves removing excess and loosely bound proteins, is crucial for understanding the biological identity of NPs. However, this approach faces two primary obstacles: (i) techniques used may inadvertently introduce protein contaminants into the biomolecular corona outcomes, potentially skewing the results; 9 and (ii) more importantly, these methods often overlook the role of the soft corona. The soft corona, comprising dynamically bound proteins, plays a pivotal role in modulating NP-cell interactions. 8 Neglecting soft corona in studies is a notable oversight, as it can significantly impact how NPs are recognized and processed in the biological systems. 7,8 n contrast, in situ analysis of the biomolecular corona provides a more realistic representation of the in vivo environment.",

Both protein-nanoparticle adsorption affinities and protein-protein interactions influence the binding of proteins on the outer layer of nanoparticles. Proteins with a hard corona are composed of firmly attached proteins that are difficult to detach, whereas proteins with a soft corona are composed of lightly adsorbed proteins. Moreover, soft and hard coronas can be distinguished based on their interchange times. Hard coronas exhibit substantially longer exchange durations, ranging from several hours to many days [26]. According to one theory, proteins in the hard corona completely connect with the surface of the nanomaterial, whereas protein-protein interactions occur at the interface between the soft and hard coronas. Even at the minimum concentration of biomolecules, the corona layer provides total surface coverage. By contrast, the adsorbed corona does not entirely obscure the outer layer of nanoparticles [82]. \n\nThe thickness of the protein corona can be influenced by several factors, including protein content, particle size, and particle surface characteristics. Proteins in plasma have hydrodynamic sizes ranging from 2 to 20 nm, and the formed protein layer is extremely thick, comprising multiple layers of linked proteins rather than just one. Simberg et al. introduced the concept of the protein corona [85]. According to this concept, the protein corona contains \"primary binders\" that directly recognize the outer layer of nanoparticles and \"secondary binders\" that interact with the primary binders through protein-protein interactions. The secondary binders may modify the activity of the primary binders or \"cover\" them, thus inhibiting their contact, which is crucial for the physiological response [86]. \n\nWalkey and Chan reviewed a group of plasma proteins called adsorbomes that are commonly found in the protein coronas of nanomaterials [87]. This list is expected to grow in the future with increasing research on the topic. Based on nearly 20 years of research, a \"normal\" plasma protein corona consists of approximately 2-6 proteins that are bound abundantly, along with numerous additional proteins that are bound with lower abundances.",

For this purpose, it describes general concepts to control (guide/minimize) the interaction between artificial nanoparticles and plasma proteins to reduce protein corona formation. Thereafter, methods for the qualitative or quantitative determination of protein corona formation are presented, as well as the properties of nanoparticle surfaces, which are relevant for protein corona prevention (or formation). Thereby especially the role of grafting density of hydrophilic polymers on the surface of the nanoparticle is discussed to prevent the formation of a protein corona. In this context also the potential of detergents (surfactants) for a temporary modification as well as grafting\u2010to and grafting\u2010from approaches for a permanent modification of the surface are discussed. The review concludes by highlighting several promising avenues. This includes (i) the use of nanoparticles without protein corona for active targeting, (ii) the use of synthetic nanoparticles without protein corona formation to address the immune system, (iii) the recollection of nanoparticles with a defined protein corona after in vivo application to sample the blood proteome and (iv) further concepts to reduce protein corona formation.",

Blood moves at a constant rate, ranging from 0.085 cm.s \u22121 in capillaries to 10 cm.s \u22121 in arteries, and a maximum of 60 cm.s \u22121 inside the aorta. Protein binding generally strengthens with increasing blood flow. However, the exact underlying cause is unknown, and it is speculated that the enhanced protein-blood interactions result from increased interactions between biological molecules and the nanostructures. Additionally, rapid flow rates induce shear stress on the outer layer of nanostructures, preventing the easy deposition of proteins and making it easier for them to connect with others that possess stronger affinity. For example, this might lead to the enrichment of proteins on the nanoparticles, such as plasminogen and other proteins. Similarly, blood flow could alter the conformational shape of unbound proteins, such as plasminogen or the von Willebrand factor (a protein that alleviates the dormant factor VIII blood-clotting protein). \n\nDiverse conformations can lead to variable interactions with nanosystems, and consequently, different protein corona compositions [82]. Furthermore, illnesses can alter the protein corona of a nanosystem. Researchers have investigated the effect of protein shortages on the remodeling of the protein corona on PS nanoparticles due to common illnesses and medical situations [83].",

This is illustrated by all the LNP components that contribute to the structure/morphology of LNPs. The PEG-lipids dictate the LNP size, and thus, influence the ratio of the surface to core distribution of the remaining components, and thereby ultimately their packing motif. The light blue highlight illustrates that PEG-lipids containing a long lipid tail improve the in vivo stability of LNPs.

            "text": "Nanomedicine's focus on complement as a central source of side effects may also miss upstream coagulation side effects: Thrombin and plasmin activate the complement cascade.In vitro and in vivo studies that assessed nanoparticle interactions with the acellular and cellular components of blood involved in clotting were necessary to evaluate the deadly side effects identified here, and similar studies may be called for in developing other physicochemical targeting approaches.\n\nHere we have focused on clotting associated with cationic lipids in LNPs, but future studies will need to investigate other nanoparticle properties that induce clotting.In this current study, we showed that LNPs with cationic lipids induce clotting, across a wide range of LNP lipid constituents (varying ionizable lipids, charged lipids, etc).We showed the same clotting side effects in liposomes formulated with cationic lipids.This strongly implicates the presence of cationic moieties as a nanoparticle feature that increases thrombosis risk.But we also identified a nanoparticle feature that reduces thrombosis risk.Varying nanoparticle size had a large effect on clot induction, with a size below ~100 nm limiting thrombosis induced by +DOTAP LNPs in mice.There are many additional nanoparticle properties that must be tested for their relationship to clotting, including mechanical properties (Young's modulus, surface fluidity), polymeric brush borders (e.g., PEG), and appended proteins (e.g., for the \"old method\" of affinity targeting).Such a systematic survey, coupled with biophysics studies of nanoparticle binding to coagulation proteins, will enable the design of safer nanoparticles.\n\nJust as nanoparticle properties must be studied in relation to clotting, we must also investigate how changes in blood itself might affect nanoparticle-associated clotting.",

Because of relatively low stability, soft corona composition and structure are difficult to characterize by available experimental techniques, which require nanoparticle suspension centrifugation or filtration steps. Additionally, the presence of soft coronas, which promote bridging interactions among nanoparticles, may lead to the destabilization of particle suspensions.",

We then discuss the impact of the so-called protein corona which is formed on the surface of NPs when they come in contact with blood or other body fluids. For example, NPs which bind inert proteins, proteins which are prone to activate the contact system (e.g., factor XII), which may lead to clotting and fibrin formation or the complement system (e.g., IgG or C3), which may result in inflammation and vascular damage. Furthermore, we describe a whole blood model which we have developed to monitor activation and interaction between different components of innate immunity: blood protein cascade systems, platelets, leukocytes, cytokine generation, which are induced by NPs. Finally, we describe our own studies on innate immunity system activation induced by three fundamentally different species of NPs (two types of engineered NPs and diesel NPs) as demonstrator of the utility of an initial determination of the composition of the protein corona formed on NPs exposed to ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) plasma and subsequent analysis in our whole blood model.",

Therefore, a compromise between the possible clinical benefits and the complexity and cost of the targeted mRNA-LNP manufacture should be taken into consideration. \n\nSome studies proposed that interaction of nanoparticles with opsonic blood proteins (i.e., opsonization) can be employed as a passive approach for targeting antigen-presenting cells [108,109] or to generate potent activation of dendritic cells through complement interactions in vaccine platforms [110]. A study conducted by Reddy et al. [110] demonstrated that intradermal injection of ultra-small ovalbumin nanoparticles as a vaccine platform resulted in targeting and activation of the dendritic cells residing in lymph nodes through complement interactions [110]. The authors concluded that intradermal administration of ovalbumin nanoparticles into mice may induce only humoral immunity via targeting lymph nodes and complement activation. \n\nThe differences in site-specific targeting and organ distribution after systemic administration of mRNA-LNP formulations can be attributed to the biomolecular corona and surface charge of LNPs. For example, adsorption of apolipoprotein E as a targeting ligand led to specific hepatic uptake of (si)RNA from ionizable (or near neutral) LNPs, but not from cationic LNPs [111].",

            "text": "Nucleic acid molecules can be transferred into cells to alter gene expression and, thus, alleviate certain pathological conditions. Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) are vectors that can be used for transfecting nucleic acids as well as many other compounds. CPPs associate nucleic acids non-covalently, forming stable nanoparticles and providing efficient transfection of cells in vitro. However, in vivo, expected efficiency is achieved only in rare cases. One of the reasons for this discrepancy is formation of protein corona around nanoparticles, once they are exposed to a biological environment, e.g. blood stream. In this study, we compared CPP-nucleic acid nanoparticles formed in the presence of bovine, murine and human serum. We used Western blot and mass-spectrometry to identify the major constituents of protein corona forming around nanoparticles, showing that proteins involved in transport, haemostasis and complement system are its major components. We investigated physical features of nanoparticles, and measured their biological efficiency in splice-correction assay. We showed that protein corona constituents might alter the fate of nanoparticles in vivo, e.g. by subjecting them to phagocytosis. We demonstrated that composition of protein corona of nanoparticles is species-specific that leads to dissimilar transfection efficiency and should be taken into account while developing delivery systems for nucleic acids.",

            "text": "The immune and the blood systems are the first biological systems interacting with intravenously administered nanomedicines. The nanoparticle surface is immediately covered with a layer of blood components, forming the so-called protein corona (Neagu et al., 2017). Its adsorption kinetics and composition appear to depend on particle surface properties and will contribute to fate of material in the body. Usually, particulate material will be cleared from the circulation by immune cells via active (phagocytosis) or passive (diffusion) transport before ending up in the organs of the reticulo-endothelial system (RES), mostly in the liver and the spleen. The nanoparticle itself, its drug-load and the particle-specific protein corona will all play their part in how the product finally interacts with various immune components. \n\nIn a joint presentation, Dr Patricia Urb\u00e1n (JRC) and Dr Blanka Halamoda (JRC) presented their literature reviews on the most prevalent in vivo effects of nanomaterials on the blood and on the immune system. Thrombosis was the most frequently reported effect among blood incompatibilities, whereas immunoactivation, including both activation of innate and acquired response, was the main reaction of the immune system (Halamoda-Kenzaoui and Bremer-Hoffmann, 2018). The adversities were linked to the main categories of nanomaterials employed in nanomedicine, such as inorganic, lipid based and polymer based NPs (Wicki et al., 2015). Inorganic NPs were the main category responsible for the induction of haematotoxic and immunotoxic effects, in particular thrombosis and inflammation. The most frequent adverse effects of lipid based NPs were the complement activation-related pseudoallergy (CARPA) and the activation of the adaptive immune system. The latter accompanied by the production of specific antibodies and accumulation of NPs in liver and spleen, lead to the so-called accelerated blood clearance (ABC) phenomenon, particularly noticeable after repetitive administration of PEGylated NPs. The reported adverse effects could often be linked to the physicochemical properties of NPs such as surface coating, surface chemistry and surface charge.",

            "text": "The delivery system for mRNA vaccines is a critical component of their development and success. For COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are employed to protect the mRNA from degradation by endonucleases as it circulates in the body and is delivered into cells. Once inside the cell, the mRNA is released into the cytoplasm, where it can initiate protein translation. LNPs, the primary delivery vehicle for these vaccines, consist of four main components: neutral phospholipids, cholesterol, polyethylene glycol (PEG) lipids, and ionizable cationic lipids (Figure 2) [23,24]. \n\nThe LNPs encapsulate the mRNA by using positively charged amine groups at low pH, which interact with the negatively charged mRNA during the manufacturing process. This positive charge not only aids in mRNA encapsulation but also facilitates the fusion of LNPs with the cell membrane during internalization. PEG lipids play a crucial role in stabilizing the nanoparticles, controlling particle size, and preventing aggregation during storage. The rapid mixing technique used in production results in particles within the size range of 60-100 nm [25]. Additionally, LNPs contain apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which is essential for the internalization of mRNA via endosomal pathways, further protecting the mRNA from degradation. Although the precise mechanisms by which LNPs safeguard mRNA are still not fully understood, it is known that the ionizable lipids in LNPs become protonated in the acidic environment of the endosome (pH <7). This protonation promotes lipid exchange between LNPs and the anionic phospholipids in the endosomal membrane, leading to membrane fusion. This fusion enables the release of mRNA into the cytosol, where it can be translated into proteins. ApoE enhances this process by helping the mRNA evade the endosomal degradation pathway [26].",

The methodology allows for tracking corona dynamics in situ under physiological conditions. Results evidence that the two extracellular vesicle populations feature distinct corona dynamics. These findings indicate that the dynamics of the biomolecular corona may ultimately be linked to the cellular origin of the extracellular vesicles, revealing an additional level of heterogeneity, and possibly of bionanoscale identity, that characterizes circulating extracellular vesicles.",

Apolipoproteins have critical role in cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases and adsorption of them on nanoparticle surface influences the nanoparticle biodistribution 41 . They also reported that apolipoproteins and complement proteins induce the uptake of nanoparticles by macrophages. However, according to our results obtained from in vivo study, we assume these proteins could improve the solubility of Ch based nanoparticles in serum pH, as they improve the solubility of lipid particles in blood. \n\nProtein C identified as autoprothrombin IIA and blood coagulation factor XIV is a proenzyme that following its activation regulates anticoagulation, inflammation, cell death, and maintains the permeability of blood vessels. Although the role of some histidine rich glycoprotein (HRG) in prohibiting phagocytosis of nanoparticles with HRG enriched protein corona by macrophages was previously demonstrated 51 , the effect of protein C, which is also a glycoprotein, has remained unclear. \n\nTo better discuss the result of the test, Fig. 3 indicates the classification of hard corona composition for the PECs based on isoelectric point (pI, A), Mw (B), and physiological function (C) of the proteins. \n\nMost of the interacted proteins, due to their high abundance in serum, have the pI between 5 to 6 and the negative charge in pH of the serum. In hard corona, the portion of proteins with neutral and positive charges considerably increased in compare with FBS contents which affirms the non-electrostatic (pI, 7-8) and electrostatic interaction (pI, 8-10) between negatively charge nanoparticles and positively charge proteins, as mentioned about interaction of hemoglobin subunits.",

            "text": "Depending on the particle surface and cell type, pre-adsorption of a protein corona can result in a reduced or enhanced uptake of nanoparticles by the recipient cells (Berrecoso et al., 2020). Here, we tested the influence on uptake of EVs that expose on their surface a protein corona or not in human phagocytes (THP1, moDCs) and as a non-phagocytic cell type, the cells the EVs were derived from (HCT 116), thus simulating the uptake by neighbouring or distant tumour cells (e.g., metastases). To this end, we incubated 10 \u03bcg mL \u22121 of Cy5-labelled liposomes or EVs with human blood plasma at 37 \u2022 C for 1 h and subsequently isolated them by centrifugation. The last pellet resulting from centrifugation was re-suspended in serum-free cell culture medium to perform the cell uptake under serum-free conditions for samples with and without pre-adsorbed protein corona. This was done to avoid the formation of a serum protein corona on plain EVs or exchange of proteins from the pre-formed human plasma protein corona with serum proteins from fetal calf serum (FCS). In our study, we focus on the difference between particles with and without a pre-formed protein corona. Thus, our results inform about the contribution of corona proteins and neglect the eventual effect of additional free plasma proteins. However, Yang et al. demonstrate that free serum proteins can also contribute to the differential uptake in presence of a protein corona as they for example, compete with particles for receptor binding. This effect might also play a role in EV uptake in presence of a human plasma protein corona. The uptake of EVs and liposomes with and without a protein corona was analyzed by flow cytometry (Figure 3). As shown in SI Figure 5 the vesicles differed in fluorescence intensity due to inequalities during the labelling process which is inherent to the amounts of possibly reactive side groups. Therefore, mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) values cannot be directly compared between vesicle types.",

            "text": "The experimental and theoretical studies have revealed that protein corona influences conformations and surface properties of nanoparticles and their interactions with cell membranes, although those mechanisms have not been well understood at the atomic scale. As computer power and force-field development have advanced, MD simulations have provided considerable useful information regarding the formation of protein corona and its effect on nanoparticle properties and the nanoparticle-membrane binding for the past decade. In particular, MD simulations have been able to explore the competitive adsorption and desorption of plasma proteins on differently sized and charged nanoparticles, which helps to explain the experimental results and the Vroman effect. \n\nAlthough MD simulations have captured the experimental observations of corona formation and its interactions with nanoparticles and membranes, there are still differences in environments and mass transport conditions of experiments and simulations, which precludes any quantitative comparison between the two. For instance, there are hundreds of plasma proteins that compete with each other and form protein corona on nanoparticle surfaces. Additionally, the flowing velocity of bloodstream may modulate protein-protein and protein-nanoparticle interactions. Cell membranes consist of various membrane proteins and lipids, and their components and ratios vary in different cells. Filaments of cytoskeleton influence the membrane shape and mechanical resistance and, thus, may modulate the protein-membrane interaction. These details should be considered to predict the adsorption kinetics and final composition of protein corona for drug delivery applications, which are expected to be resolved in the future by recent efforts in developing multiscale-simulation methodologies and realistic cell-membrane models. Despite these limitations, MD simulations have successfully interpreted the Vroman effect and experimental observations at the atomic scale, clearly indicating a promising tool for the rational design of highly efficient drug delivery systems.",

[65][66][67][68] Effectively what it means is that, the original nanoparticle surface is not seen by the cell membrane, but rather those biomolecules which remain on the nanoparticle surface for long enough. Thus, cell membrane receptors will interact with biomolecules in the corona, and, presumably, this interaction will determine by which mechanism the nanoparticle enters the cell. 69,70 Subsequently, one would hypothesize that once inside, the biomolecules in the corona -if, indeed, the remain associated with the nanoparticle 71-73 -will determine to where the nanoparticle is shuttled, including if it is sent through to the other side of the barrier. This puts the spotlight on identifying which biomolecules are found in the corona, and which remain there for long times. It is noteworthy that the corona composition is not a simple reflection of the biofluid in which the nanoparticle is found. That is, if a nanoparticle is put into blood plasma with serum albumin as its main component, this does not imply that serum albumin is the main component of the nanoparticle corona. 49 Rather, low abundant species are frequently picked up by nanoparticles, and, in general, the corona depends strongly on nanoparticle properties such as surface, 74 size, 61,74 shape 75 and even concentration of the biofluid. 60 Importance in vivo It seems clear that the corona will be a key determinant of how the nanoparticles are processed in vivo. In a sense, this has already been partly demonstrated.

            "text": "The typical structure of LNPs comprises four essential components: ionizable cationic lipids, phospholipids, cholesterol, and PEGylated lipids. [9,64] These components confer distinct advantages to LNPs in delivering nucleic acid drugs. The nucleic acid component of these drugs is negatively charged, while the ionizable cationic lipids, a critical component of LNPs, feature a positively charged hydrophilic amino head in acidic environments. This allows for the encapsulation of nucleic acids within the lipid nanoparticles via electrostatic interactions. In a neutral plasma environment, these lipids are uncharged, thus avoiding uptake by monocyte macrophages, reducing toxicity, and finally becoming endosomes for release into the cytoplasm through megacellular drinking. [65] Among them, the key to improve the delivery efficiency is the release of LNPs from endosomes, i.e., the efficiency of endosome escape. The mechanism of endosomal escape is closely related to ionizable cationic lipids. One theory hypothesizes that cationic lipids interact with anionic phospholipids in the endosomal membrane to form a non-bilayer structure and disrupt the endosomal membrane, thereby releasing nucleic acids. [66] In contrast, another hypothesis suggests that the delivery efficiency of cationic lipids can be attributed to the pro-ton sponge phenomenon, in which buffering cationic polymers bind protons in the endosomes and activate the endosomal proton pump, allowing chloride ions to enter the endosomes along with the protons, elevating the osmotic pressure and causing the endosomes to swell and rupture. [67] However, the inefficiency of endosomal escape and the unidentified mechanism still make it a rate-limiting step in the delivery of LNPs. [68] PEGylated lipids prevent the aggregation of LNPs, while phospholipids contribute to nanoparticle formation. Cholesterol enhances the stability of nucleic acid-lipid nanoparticles and promotes their fusion with cellular membranes. [9,69,70]",

Extracellular vesicles (EVs), can be seen as natural nanoparticles. However, EVs are produced under different cell culture conditions and little is known about the protein corona forming on EVs and its influence on their uptake by target cells. Here, we use a proteomic approach in order to analyze the protein composition of the EVs themselves and the protein composition of a human blood plasma protein corona around EVs. Moreover, we analyze the influence of the protein corona on EV uptake into human monocytes and compare it with the influence on the uptake of engineered liposomes. We show that the presence of a protein corona increases the uptake of EVs in human monocytes. While for liposomes this seems to be triggered by the presence of immunoglobulins in the protein corona, for EVs blocking the Fc receptors on monocytes did not show an influence of uptake. Therefore, other mechanisms of docking to the cell membrane and uptake are most like involved, demonstrating a clear difference between EVs and liposomes as technically produced nanocarriers.",

            "text": "The most important difficulty in obtaining a successful translation of innovative formulations in clinical practice is the lack of knowledge of their in vivo performance at systemic, tissue, and cellular levels (Tang et al., 2017). This large gap between the design of nanosystems and their effective clinical application is primarily due to the partial understanding of the in vivo fate of nanomaterials. Once systemically administered, nanoparticles are characterized by a significant modulation of their physicochemical characteristics. For this reason, a full characterization of nanosystems is a mandatory step in the preformulation phases of novel nanomaterials in order to improve the outcomes in the development of nanomedicines (Corbo et al., 2016). Upon exposure to biological fluids N of nanoparticles dynamically and often immediately (<0.5 min) interact with biomolecules such as proteins and lipids through a process defined as opsonization when injected into the blood stream, promoting the formation of the so-called \"biocorona\" on their surfaces (Cai and Chen, 2019;Lima et al., 2020). The adsorption of opsonins causes their recognition as non-self compounds, promoting their metabolism and elimination by the MPS, leading to a rapid clearance, low efficiency, and high liver accumulation. Notably, opsonins rapidly identify the positively-charged particles with respect to anionic systems (Neagu et al., 2017). \n\nSeveral types of serum proteins, such as serum albumin, immunoglobulin G, fibrinogen, clustering and apolipoproteins generally present in the biological milieu, can all interact with circulating nanosystems (Lee et al., 2015). It has been reported by several studies that the formation of a protein corona is a dynamic process, induced by the competition of various proteins adsorbed onto the surfaces of nanoparticles and it can be classified as either \"soft\" or \"hard\" as a function of the nature of the compounds and interactions involved. Namely, the hard corona presents the first tightly bound layer of proteins over an extended period (many hours), while the soft corona represents a second layer of protein (not directly bound to the nanosystems) facing rapid exchanges for shorter periods (i.e.",

            "text": "Due to their unique mechanical, thermal, chemical, and electronic properties, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have attracted a lot of attention in the field of nanotechnology. Most interestingly, the potential diagnostic and therapeutic applications of CNTs in medicine are being increasingly explored [1][2][3][4][5][6]. It is well known that nanoparticles are rapidly coated with various proteins in biological fluids (such as blood, plasma, or interstitial fluid) to form a protein corona [7,8]. Upon formation, the nanoparticle-protein corona complex, rather than the pristine nanoparticles per se, functions as the biological entity further interacting with other components inside cells or living organisms, which potentially influence the downstream biological events. \n\nRecent studies have identified various proteins that can be adsorbed to different nanoparticles to form the protein corona. Among these, bovine serum albumin (BSA) has been commonly adopted as a model protein to study the formation of protein corona on nanoparticles, including carbon-based nanoparticles [9][10][11][12], metal nanoparticles such as gold [13][14][15], aluminum nanoparticles [16], and zinc oxide nanoparticles [17,18]. Nonetheless, the mechanisms underlying the interaction between nanoparticles and proteins and subsequent biological responses are still poorly understood. \n\nThe formation of a protein corona is hypothesized to highly depend on surface properties of nanoparticles. As for CNTs, surface functionalization has been developed to improve their dispersion, stability, and biocompatibility by introducing carboxylic groups or other oxygen-containing groups [19,20]. Carboxylated CNTs can further conjugate covalently with various functional molecules such as drugs, proteins, and oligonucleotides. For example, both singlewalled CNTs (SWCNTs) and multiwalled CNTs (MWCNTs) were functionalized using microwave-assisted acid treatment to induce carboxylation [21,22] and were found to bind more proteins than pristine CNTs in simulated cell culture conditions [23].",

            "text": "Nanoparticles (NPs) are increasingly prevalent in our society, with applications ranging from nanomedicine, photovoltaics, cosmetics and beyond. Despite the ubiquity of their use, we still lack a fundamental understanding of how NPs interact with their local environments. This poor understanding becomes a critical problem when using NPs in real-life situations. Notably, it has been well documented that introducing NPs into biological fluids results in the formation of a surrogated biological identity known as the biomolecular corona, which is the spontaneous adsorption of proteins 1 , lipids 2 , sugar moieties 3 , nucleic acids 4 and metabolites 5,6 onto nanomaterial surfaces. The composition of the biomolecular corona strongly determines the ultimate fate of NPs [7][8][9] . As most studies that address the biomolecular corona formation have focused on proteins adsorbed to the surface of NPs 10 , together with the fact that the predominant model for the formation of the biomolecular corona is hegemonized by the direct adsorption of proteins from biological milieus 11 , this Review comprehensively focuses on the protein corona. \n\nThe emergence of the concept of the protein corona in nanomedicine substantially altered perspectives of researchers and interpretation of biosystem-NP interactions. The first critical milestone occurred in 2007 when Dawson's group conceived the term protein corona 12 . However, protein corona studies commenced as early as the late 1950s 13 and early 1960s 14,15 under a slightly different terminology and a colloidal science context. The characterization of protein coronas has revealed that the adsorption of proteins onto nanomaterials can have mixed biological effects. Protein corona patterns, which are dependent on the physicochemical properties of nanomaterials and the complexities of biological matrices, can unpredictably change NP outcomes including function 16 , uptake 17,18 , biodistribution 19,20 , immunological responses 10,21 and toxicity 22,23 , and can thus be a challenge for therapeutic nanomedicine.",

            "text": "At the same time, the corona confers a new biological identity to nanomaterials and can affect the way nanomedicines are recognized and processed by cells [3,7,8,20,21,36,48]. Biomolecules present in the corona can, per se, have targeting capabilities towards particular receptors [17,18,[49][50][51][52]. For example, apolipoprotein B and immunoglobulin G in the corona of 100 nm silica nanoparticles incubated with human serum were found to interact with their corresponding receptors, low-density lipoprotein receptor and Fc-gamma receptor I, respectively [17]. Similarly, lipid nanoparticles were efficiently targeted to the hepatocytes upon adsorption of apoE on their surface following administration [52,53]. Thus, controlling the corona composition can possibly provide new ways to control the initial interactions of nano-sized materials with cells. \n\nThe corona composition depends on nanoparticle physicochemical characteristics, such as size, shape, charge, hydrophobicity, rigidity and surface characteristics [3,7,8,48,54]. By changing these properties, the corona composition might be tuned to contain components that bind to specific cell surface receptors and initiate internalization [17,49,[55][56][57]. Similarly, artificial coronas can be formed to achieve recognition by specific receptors. For instance, Tonigold and colleagues have shown that pre-adsorbed antibodies, which could be seen as a form of preformed corona, kept, at least partially, their targeting ability in the presence of serum [40]. \n\nFrom a broader perspective, the effects of the corona on the interactions of nanoparticles with cells are being more and more recognized [41,58,59]. For example, multiple attempts have been made in trying to predict how the presence of the corona affects targeting of nanomedicines [60,61].",

            "text": "Above we have described the NPs' characteristics, including their surface properties and aggregation state. As the aggregation state is determined by the surface chemistry, we will turn our attention to the biomolecular corona. Previous studies have mainly focused on the protein corona, but the corona also contains lipids [8,51,52] and likely carbohydrates. At low NP concentration levels, determining the biomolecular corona is a challenge. However, by combining the pellets, formed in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS, from 5 experiments, sufficient amount of material could be obtained for analysis by SDS-PAGE, S8 Fig, and mass spectrometry (see materials and methods for details). We identified several proteins (S1 Table ) in the Au NPs' corona, of which many have been previously described in the literature [31]. Proteins of a very broad size range are found on the NP surface or incorporated in complexes with the NP and other proteins. Alpha- 2-macroglobulin is the largest protein found in the corona. It has a molecular weight of 725 kDa and its dimensions are approximately 10 nm in diameter and 15-20 nm in length [53]. The protein is therefore of similar size to the smaller Au NPs and will considerably change the size and density of the NP protein complex. The lower density slows down the sedimentation rate, resulting in a smaller apparent diameter of the complex by DCS. Lipid binding proteins as apolipoprotein E and gelsolin were also found in the corona. It has been shown for polymeric and TiO 2 NPs that the lipids remain on the NP surface after binding and even have a preferential binding compared to other proteins [8,51,52]. Bound lipids will significantly change the complex' density. Apolipoprotein E is part of the lipoprotein particle chylomicrons which transport lipids in blood from the intestine. The density of chylomicrons is less than 1 g/cm 3 and their size can be more than a micrometer. The low NP concentration made it impossible to determine the lipid concentration in the pellet.",

            "text": "A commonly investigated nanoparticle application is the development of target-specific drug carriers. Here, the corona may have an important role as plasma proteins have been shown to block ligands attached to the nanoparticle surface or compete with the interaction between ligands and cell receptors [20][21][22]. Dell'Orco et al. have previously modelled targeted delivery in the presence of an exchanging corona, to identify factors that are important for successful targeting [20,21,23]. The size of the bound proteins and their binding affinity for the particle surface were identified as very important. However, the particle size was found to be even more crutial. In the current work, this feature is addressed in experiments and confirmed to be important. \n\nTo the best of our knowledge, all studies characterizing the protein corona are performed in serum or plasma stabilized with different agents. In this work we investigate the corona composition as a function of the source of the plasma proteins, i.e. dependent on the treatment of blood after withdrawal. Blood can, after withdrawal, be treated in different ways to generate different liquids, conventionally named as: whole blood, whole blood with EDTA or Citrate, blood plasma or blood serum. We find that the protein corona composition differ between these four different biological fluids. As the protein corona is important for target delivery, this will have implications for the in vitro evaluation of a target-specific nanoparticle system. \n\nWe also show that the ratio between particle surface area and biological macromolecules in a sample affect the composition of the corona. \n\nKnowledge about composition and dynamics of protein coronas is vital for the development of successful future nanoparticle-based medical applications. However, our current methods to analyze the corona may not be the optimal ones. In this paper, the limitations of the current methods are highlighted and the research fields is encouraged to find new suitable methods.",

The structure and composition of the protein corona depends on the synthetic identity of the nanomaterial, this would influence the biological identity of NPs [28]. The physiological functions of various proteins that comprise the protein corona generally involve lipid transport, coagulation, complement activation, pathogen recognition, or ion transport [29]. Understanding NPs-protein interactions is a crucial issue in the development of targeted nanomaterial delivery in vivo [30]. The physiological environment to which NPs are first exposed after intravenous administration is the blood stream, and the cell-free portion of the blood (plasma) contains more than 1000 proteins. These proteins potentially interact with NPs to exert different physiological functions, such as recognition by macrophages, causing inflammatory reactions, thrombosis and allergic reactions [31]. \n\nThe safety issues of biomaterials with exceptional biocompatibility and hemo-compatibility have also received extensive attention at the nanoscale. Numerous nanomaterials have been widely used as drug delivery systems and diagnostic contrast agents in treating cardiovascular diseases. This article focuses on polymer NPs and explores their bioactivity impact on the development of AS and physiochemical mechanisms. Therefore, we conducted a study of the effects of poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) NPs, which are widely used in a variety of Food and Drug Administration approved therapeutic devices, on the development of aortic atherosclerotic plaques in ApoE \u2212/\u2212 mice.",

We noted a transition from a unimodal size distribution of liposomes in PBS buffer to a multimodal size distribution after extended incubation with 10% FBS. This caused sharp increases in the PDI of both formulations with increases in size and polydispersity (PDI) being greater for the target-lipo vesicles. \n\nThe emergence of particle populations with different sizes is not unexpected considering that FBS represents a complex, concentrated cocktail of polydisperse proteins of different sizes [27]. Indeed, the surface properties of various nanoparticles have been shown to change dramatically in the presence of plasma or serum [28] with the establishment of an adsorbed protein corona around the nanoparticle. It is now widely accepted that the particle protein corona presents a new biomolecular interface that underpins the dynamic interactions of nanosystems and their biological targets. The presentation of a high affinity GRPR antagonist peptide on the liposomal surface is expected to maintain liposomal cell-binding affinity by virtue of its high affinity for the receptor. Although, steric blockade of the targeting motif is possible due to the dynamic exchange events association with the evolution of the hard and soft corona, even on pegylated liposomes.",

Once the drug is administered into the systemic circulation, the PEG-lipid is replaced by serum proteins, mainly ApoE, which interact with the cholesterol component of the lipid complex and target the drug to the liver [117,118].

Therefore, smaller (9.5 nm) silica particles were also analyzed in the four different blood solutions, the experiment setup resulted in a difference of a factor of ~4 times more particle surface area in the samples compared to the 76 nm particles. The result is shown in Fig 2 . In a similar manner as for the 76 nm silica particles, there are clear differences in the formed coronas for the 9.5 nm particles. An overlay of the formed protein corona on the 9.5 and 76 nm silica particles in plasma, shown in Fig 3, reveals that particle size is important for the corona composition. Another striking difference is the lack of a pronounced Apolipoprotein A-I band for the 9.5 nm silica particles in whole blood. \n\nThe particle size influence on the formed protein corona was further explored by determining the formed protein corona around 13 and 23 nm silica particles. For both particles the surface area was the same as for the 9.5 nm particles, i.e. ~4 times more than the 76 nm particles. The gel in Figure B in S1 File shows the detected coronas around 13 and 23 nm silica nanoparticles. The detected coronas for the whole blood samples resembles more the 76 nm sample, with a pronounced apolipoprotein A-I band, than the 9.5 nm sample (even though they are much closer in size to the 9.5 nm particle). In serum, the detected coronas can be seen as a transition from the 9.5 to the 76 nm nanoparticle corona, with a decrease of the amount of detected apolipoprotein A-I with increasing size of the particle. This is probably an effect of the change in curvature/size of the nanoparticles. However, the really interesting data are the coronas for the whole blood with EDTA and plasma samples. The amount of detected protein from whole blood with EDTA for the 13 and 23 nm particles is lower than for the 9.5 nm particles, indicating a relatively sharp cutoff for maximum apolipoprotein A-I binding.",

            "text": "Intravenous administration of lipid nanoparticles has been the most common route to deliver therapeutic genes to endothelial cells, as these cells are located in the inner surface of blood vessels and are in direct contact with the blood. However, when nanoparticles enter the blood circulation, they are often eliminated by cells of the reticuloendothelial system or preferentially transfect hepatocytes, which prevents nanoparticles from reaching and transfecting endothelial cells [69,94,[186][187][188][189]. As such, strategies have been developed to bypass hepatocytes in order to reach and transfect endothelial cells. Among the strategies developed, the use of cationic lipids or polymers to generate nanoparticles that target endothelial cells has made considerable progress. Dorkin et al. showed that incorporation of the permanently cationic lipid, DOTAP, to LNPs that otherwise target the liver could be redirected to transfect pulmonary endothelial cells [182]. Dorkin et al. also found that liver-targeted lipid nanoparticles, which are nanoparticles that preferentially transfect hepatocytes on their own, specifically C12-200, cKK-E12, and 503O13 nanoparticles, could have a shift in their tropism and transfect pulmonary endothelial cells by incorporating the lipid DOTAP in their formulation [182]. This finding was later expanded by Cheng et al. to include additional cationic lipids, such as DDAB and EPC, to other liver-targeted nanoparticles like 5A2-SC8 and DLin-MC3-DMA to enable transfection of pulmonary endothelial cells [181]. The mechanism by which these nanoparticles target and deliver nucleic acids to the lung may be due to association with a protein or group of proteins that binds to the surface of the nanoparticles and selectively delivers them to the pulmonary endothelium [95,190]. For example, lipid compositions can shift the protein corona abundance away from ApoE, which is a recognized driver of hepatocyte LNP uptake and transfection [191",

            "text": "The PEG shedding strategy used in recently developed LNP systems is based on PEG lipid desorption from the LNP surface upon entering systemic circulation. The PEG coating on one hand prevents the aggregation of liposomes upon storage and to some extent in vivo also, but on the other hand hinders interactions of lipid nanoparticles with target cell membranes and their subsequent internalization [50,51]. Ideally, the PEG layer should be removed at the site of action. \n\nThe way the PEG coating is exploited for targeting/stability has varied over the years by either making it a more stable component of LNP systems to evade undesired immune responses while in systemic circulation, as in the case of intravenously administered LNPs, or by applying the PEG coating as a transient component which provides stability upon storage but sheds in vivo upon interaction with serum proteins, as is the case for intramuscularly administered LNPs. The shedding of PEG relies on (i) shorter carbon chain lengths of the lipid that is conjugated to the PEG, (ii) the concentration of serum proteins in vivo, and (iii) the time of exposure to serum proteins [52]. In an in vitro study, Gallud et al. [52] demonstrated an increase in the uptake of PEGylated LNPs in Huh 7 cells when LNPs were pre-incubated in fetal bovine serum (FBS). Moreover, the increase in LNP uptake was proportional to the amount of FBS present and the time of incubation. They also showed that LNPs anchored to streptavidin via Biotin-mediated binding were released as the medium was exposed to FBS, providing a clear insight into the FBS-mediated release of PEG lipids. However, the precise mechanism of stimulation by serum proteins to augment the PEG lipid release from the LNPs is still unknown. \n\nAdditionally, there are other mechanisms that play a vital role in PEG lipid removal from nanoparticles. One such force is the cohesive interaction of PEG lipids within nanoparticles with other lipid components.",

            "text": "Binding proteins to the NPs surface can alter their structures, which leads to the loss of their enzymatic activity, disturbance of biological processes, and acceleration the pathogenic events such as amyloidosis. On the other hand, the adsorption of proteins on the NPs surface can alter their colloidal characteristics, including NPs aggregation characteristics, and/or hydrodynamic diameter, which may affect the cellular response to the NP's exposure, including accumulation, toxicity and clearance. (Dawson and Yan, 2021). Indeed, the challenges in understanding biomolecular corona complexes are multifaceted and require a comprehensive, interdisciplinary approach. Establishing a highly collaborative infrastructure would facilitate thorough physicochemical characterization of materials, the identification of biomolecular components such as proteins, lipids, glycans, or DNA, and the elucidation of their biological functions. (Mahmoudi, 2022). For example, recent studies have shown that the corona can adsorb circulating DNA (Griffith et al., 2020), which significantly influences the NP-mediated immune response (Anees et al., 2024), while others have reported the connection between the glyco-corona and its effects on the in vivo localization of NPs (Wan et al., 2015). However, there is still a need to improve the methodologies for preparing the corona formed on NPs to ensure reproducibility and robustness. (Mahmoudi, 2022). For instance, current experimental protocols require the NP exposure to be performed under shaking conditions, which often falls short in replicating the shear forces encountered by NPs in the bloodstream, impacting their behavior and interaction with biomolecules. The knowledge on nano-bio interactions together with clear methods and protocols are crucial to obtain before transferring the NPs to industrial bodies, ensuring that only safe NPs are introduced to the market. (Petersen et al., 2022;Fadeel and Keller, 2024). \n\nIn this context, the literature is abundant with a large number of publications, which focus typically on the dynamic and composition of PC formation and the impact of PC on biomedical applications of different NPs, including distribution, toxicity, and clearance.",

            "text": "the quantity of proteins taken up over time [27]. Those are areas warranting research as the proteins on the corona are susceptible to posttranslational modifications, including the binding of lipids and carbohydrates.\n\nThe non-cellular blood interactome is likely to be host-specific and capable of modifying pathogen infectivity. How does this explain individual susceptibility to disease? Currently, it is impossible to answer this question. Blood protein composition may be influenced by innate factors such as age, nutritional status, genetics, immune competence, and underlying chronic diseases, and by extrinsic factors such as drug use, lifestyle, and geographic origin [112]. These factors could influence the composition of the host-specific non-cellular interactome of the pathogen. Changes in protein corona composition have been documented with artificial nanoparticles [112,113]. Proteins' conformation may change in many diseases [113], potentially altering the blood interactome of the pathogen. Like the proposal of a \"personalized\" protein corona which affects nanoparticles' biochemistry and biology [112,113], we anticipate that the pathogen enters the host and circulates in association with a host-specific (\"personalized\") non-cellular blood interactome. Hypothetically, the blood proteome and metabolome may differ in different disease states consistent with a state-specific blood interactome that forms the basis for the state-and host-specific acquired pathogen's biocorona. State-specific post-translational modifications of blood proteins may affect the pathogen-associated non-cellular interactome. Proteins surrounding the pathogen surface may undergo misfolding and aggregation (protein unfolding has been reported in studies with artificial nanoparticles [114]). Pathogen-protein interactions may induce the exposure of hidden protein epitopes (as happens with nanoparticle-denatured proteins [28,114]). This could enhance immunological responses and/or induce unwanted inflammatory responses. We postulate that the host-specific non-cellular blood interactome is an important external variable that can render the host susceptible or resilient to infectious diseases. Recognition of the non-cellular blood interactome as an innate immune response could help explain why an infectious agent that is virulent in one setting may be mild",

            "text": "Delivery efficiency and biodistribution of mRNA vectors are affected by the surface composition of vectors. A prominent example of surface modification is the incorporation of PEG-chains. PEGylation of nanoparticles changes the trafficking of nanocarriers, extends half-life of delivery vectors in vivo by preventing interactions with serum proteins and phagocytes, and enhances the solubility and stability of delivery vectors by increasing hydrophilicity [264]. While PEG moiety plays a key role in biodistribution and half-life of nanocarriers, it hinders efficient uptake of nanoparticles by cells because of steric hindrance and inhibited interactions with the plasma membrane [218]. Therefore, PEG-chains are designed to detach in the serum to alleviate the steric hindrance and allow the nanocarriers to interact with ApoE and to subsequently enter the cells by ApoE-mediated endocytosis [218,265,266].\n\nAs with ApoE-mediated nanoparticle uptake, there is interest in biomolecular surface modification that may facilitate nanoparticlemediated gene transfer. A recent report by Sch\u00f6ttler et al. suggests that the \"stealth\" effect of PEG-coating may be due to the formation of a biomolecular corona via attractive interactions [267]. Although the formation of the protein corona is a well-known fact [268], studies considering and exploiting this aspect in the context of mRNA gene therapy have been limited [165]. This circumstance could explain why there has been a weak correlation between in vitro and in vivo studies of LNPs since biomolecular corona can cause particle agglomeration, premature release of LNP content, or lipid dissociation depending on the content of the corona [269,270].\n\nIncorporation of carbohydrates (such as mannose) on the nanocarriers can also influence the trafficking to the LNs and uptake to immune cells [271,272]. Tokatlian et al. demonstrated that trimannosylation of the HIV nanoparticle immunogens leads to strong GC reactions because of the facilitated accumulation in LNs with a complement-, mannose-binding lectin-mediated, immunogen glycandepen",

We will highlight the parameters influencing the quantity and the identity of the adsorbed proteins. In a second part, we will resume the main findings about the influence of a biomolecular corona on cellular uptake, toxicity, biodistribution and targeting ability. To be noticed is the need for standardized experiments and very precise reports of the protocols and methods used in the experimental sections to extract informative data.

Using size-exclusion column chromatography (SEC), isolation of the plasma protein-bound LNPs was performed (Fig. S14). A ~2-fold higher (wt/wt) adsorption of plasma proteins was found for LNP with the Onpattro-like lipid composition as compared to the liposomal LNP system (Fig. 3A). Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis suggested both formulations exhibited a broadly similar plasma protein profile (Fig. 3B, Table S4). Liposomal LNP formulations with other ionizable lipids such as ALC-0315 and SM-102 also showed a decrease in protein adsorption after SEC (Fig. S15). Mass spectrometry (MS) proteomic analysis detected over 1000 different proteins in the BMC of both formulations (Fig. 3C). Volcano plot analysis showed 98 proteins that are statistically different (P value = 0.01) between the two formulations. Notably, the liposomal LNP exhibit significantly lower immunoglobulin heavy variable 10-1 (Ighv10-1) and fibrinogen (Fgb) levels (Fig. S16). The classes of proteins adsorbed by liposomal LNP and Onpattro-like systems were similar but with a slight reduction in immunoproteins (~4.4% less) and a slight increase in apolipoprotein (~3.6% more) for the liposomal LNP as shown in Fig. 3D and Table S4 [21][22][23] . While the dominant contribution to prolonged circulation lifetimes correlates with the overall reduction in adsorbed plasma proteins, it is possible that the reduced levels of immune proteins and increased levels of apolipoproteins could also contribute to this effect.",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have become a cornerstone in modern vaccine technology, particularly with the rapid development of mRNA-based vaccines, such as the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines [141,142]. LNPs are nanoscale particles composed primarily of lipids that are designed to encapsulate and protect fragile molecules such as mRNA, ensuring their stability during storage and transportation [143]. In the context of mRNA vaccines, LNPs serve as the delivery vehicle that shields the mRNA from enzymatic degradation and facilitates its delivery into host cells [144]. \n\nThe success of LNPs in mRNA vaccines is largely attributed to their ability to effectively interact with cell membranes [145]. When administered, LNPs are taken up by cells through endocytosis, where the mRNA is then released into the cytoplasm [146]. The LNPs' lipid composition is crucial for this process, as the lipid bilayer can fuse with the cell membrane, allowing the mRNA to be directly delivered into the cells without triggering excessive immune responses or causing toxicity [147,148]. Once inside the cell, the mRNA is translated into the protein of interest, such as the spike protein in the case of the COVID-19 vaccines, triggering an immune response that prepares the body to recognize and fight the virus if it is encountered again [149]. \n\nOne of the key advantages of LNPs in vaccine delivery is their ability to induce strong immune activation [150,151]. They enhance the uptake of mRNA by dendritic cells and other antigen-presenting cells, which are responsible for initiating the immune response. This leads to the production of both neutralizing antibodies and T-cell responses, both of which are crucial for protecting against viral infections [150,152,153]. Additionally, LNPs have shown promise in targeting specific tissues or organs, increasing the efficiency of vaccine delivery while potentially reducing side effects or systemic toxicity [154,155]. \n\nLNPs are also highly versatile, allowing for customization of their lipid components to optimize the release profile, stability, and biocompatibility of the mRNA payload [156].",

            "text": "To further investigate the protein corona composition, proteins are typically separated and desorbed from purified protein-nanoparticle complexes. We utilized the sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) method by cutting protein gel bands and then performing protein sequencing using LC-MS/MS, which allows for both qualitative and quantitative analysis of PCs (Figure 3). The current mechanisms underlying how the protein corona affects cell metabolism are not yet clear. It is known that proteins in the corona on nanoparticles can interact with other biomolecules inside and outside the cells. The intracellular protein corona regulates the macrophage phenotype and induces stress responses in endothelial cells. We believe that intercellular proteins replace some proteins from the surface of nanoparticles, disrupting protein homeostasis, subsequently triggering the \"Neutrophil activation involved in immune response\", \"Respiratory vesicle lumen\", \"Cytoplasmic vesicle lumen\", and \"Secretory granule lumen\" pathways (Figure 4). The PC-induced neutrophils impact the cellular clearance pathways of nanoparticles and alter cell metabolism. Currently, the targeted delivery of nanomedicines still presents significant challenges. Research by Wilhelm et al. has shown that only 0.7% of nanomaterials can be effectively transported to specific target sites [25]. Ideally, drugs should be enriched in target organs while minimizing accumulation in other tissues. However, in most cases, the formation of the protein corona weakens the targeting ability of nanomaterials. This is because the PC covers the surface of the nanomaterial carrying ligands, creating a barrier between the ligands and target cells, impeding their mutual recognition and reducing targeting efficiency. Therefore, in the follow-up experiments, we will knock out or inhibit proteins such as F-actin, Coronin, vATPase, TUBA, TUBB, MHCII, and TSP to elucidate the impact of these protein coronas on the mechanism of cellular phagocytosis.",

            "text": "Many diseases can affect the liver. Among them, tyrosinemia [104,105] and autoimmune hepatitis [106] are very severe diseases. Fortunately, LNP delivery to the liver is very effective. It is enhanced by the biological effect of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) [107,108]. After LNPs are injected intravenously, ApoE forms a corona around the particles. Since ApoE binds specifically to receptors on hepatocytes, it directs LNPs towards the liver. This explains why LNPs are more easily trapped by the liver [108]. In addition, the liver can be used as a protein factory [109] to treat various rare diseases through gene therapy. As the liver is an excellent therapeutic target, it is important to optimize delivery to this organ. \n\nPatisiran (ONPATTRO\u2122) is the first RNA drug delivered by LNPs that has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [107]. This LNP is composed of DLin-MC3-DMA/DSPC/cholesterol/DMG-PEG at a molar ratio of 50:10:38.5:1.5 [110]. As it was the first to be approved, this formulation inspired the composition of other LNPs. Table 4 presents some formulations that target the liver. \n\nLiu et al. [22] obtained impressive results. When delivering LNPs with Cas9 mRNA, along with a sgRNA targeting PCSK9, they succeeded in reducing the serum PCSK9 by 80%. They used the following formulation: BAMEA-16B/DOPE/cholesterol/DSPE-PEG (16/4/8/1 w:w). They used a lipid:mRNA ratio of 15:1 (w:w). Their LNP had a size of 230 nm. Fortunately, they observed no signs of inflammation and no obvious hepatocellular injury. Rothgangl et al. [113] have obtained important results.",

            "title": "Corona Composition Can Affect the Mechanisms Cells Use to Internalize Nanoparticles",
            "text": "interesting observation is that nanoparticle uptake is lower at higher serum content. Similar observations were already reported for experiments where the excess proteins were left in situ, 12,67 possibly due to competition with the corona proteins for the same receptors. 10 However, here lower uptake was observed also after corona isolation and removal of excess free proteins. The lower uptake could be related to specific differences in corona composition. For instance, a study on macrophages suggested that the presence of histidinerich glycoprotein in the corona is associated with a decreased uptake. 68 Here, similarly, the observed higher abundance of this protein in the corona formed at higher serum content could be one of the factors contributing to their lower uptake. Further studies are necessary to fully demonstrate similar effects connected to the relative abundance of individual proteins in the corona.\n\nNext to this, the results suggest that multiple uptake mechanisms seem involved at the same time in the uptake of nanoparticles. It has been previously hypothesized that, within a sample, multiple subpopulations of different coronas may be formed, 7 and this could explain\ue0d5at least in part\ue0d5the observed co-presence of different uptake mechanisms. More subtle changes of corona composition over time and during exposure to cells could also explain this observation. Further studies are required to fully characterize the molecular details of the mechanisms involved in each case, possibly combining the use of transport inhibitors and RNA interference with other methods, such as the use of genetically modified cells.\n\nOverall, these results clearly highlight the importance of defining what the \"correct corona\" is for each nanomedicine (or nanoparticle) when investigating its behavior on cells. For instance, for nanomedicines administered by injection, not only higher serum content but also other factors likely to affect corona composition should be considered, such as the presence of blood flow and the more complex composition of plasma in vivo (as opposed to the serum used here). 13,36 Similar considerations should also be applied to nanomedicines administered via different routes, for instance inhaled or ingested nanomedicines, for which a serum corona may be not relevant. Additionally, other more complex factors such as the evolution of corona composition over time and changes due to the interaction with secreted cellular biomolecules may also affect the uptake mechanisms",

            "text": "Once embedded in a physiological environment, the surface of nanoparticles (NPs) gets covered with a biomolecular corona (BC) that alters their synthetic characteristics and subsequently gives them a peculiar biological identity. Despite recent studies having clarified the role of NP composition, surface chemistry and biological source (e.g., human/animal serum or plasma) in the formation of the BC, little is known about the possible impact of molecular crowding. To fill this gap, we used a cationic liposomal formulation as a model system and studied its biological identity upon incubation with human plasma, at a fixed liposome-to-plasma volume ratio and different concentrations. We carried out dynamic light scattering measurements to quantify the size and zeta potential of the investigated systems and gel electrophoresis to evaluate the composition of the corresponding coronas. Our findings suggest that NP stability may be compromised by molecular crowding, but the corona composition is stable over a wide range of concentrations, which extend over more than two orders of magnitude. As the biological identity of NPs eventually determines their final fate in vivo, we predict that this study could contribute to the development of a safe and effective nanosystem for the targeted delivery of therapeutic agents.",

In particular, LNPs have been clinically approved to facilitate efficient delivery of ribonucleic acid (RNA)-based medicines, including the mRNA (mRNA)\u2212 LNP vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 1,2 and small interfering RNA (siRNA)\u2212LNP therapeutics like patisiran, which treats polyneuropathies induced by hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis. 3 Early research on RNA vaccines has demonstrated that naked RNA is quickly degraded after administration by cellular ribonucleases (RNases). 4,5 LNPs slow down the degradation process to ensure RNA stability while also promoting cellular internalization via endocytosis and allowing intracellular release of RNA into the cytoplasm for translation by cellular machinery. 6,7 The loading of mRNA cargo into nanoparticles is a spontaneous process wherein lipids undergo rapid mixing with RNA and collectively self-assemble into particles approximately 100 nm in diameter. 8 he composition of LNPs typically includes an ionizable cationic lipid and three neutral helper lipids: phospholipid, cholesterol, and lipid-anchored polyethylene glycol (PEGylated lipid). The ionizable cationic lipids are electrostatically complexed with polyanionic RNA to enable its encapsulation by the neutral lipids and facilitate cellular uptake and endosomal escape. 8,9 Phospholipids may play a role in membrane fusion and endosomal escape, but they mainly provide structural integrity to the particles. 7,10 Similarly, cholesterol enhances stability and fluidity of the LNP and improves intracellular delivery. 7,11 PEGylated lipids introduce a steric barrier at the surface of particles to increase colloidal stability by reducing aggregation and to \"shield\" particles from being bound by serum proteins in vivo including opsonins, which mark LNPs for removal by phagocytic systems. 7,12",

            "text": "Gene delivery offers solutions for the treatment of rare diseases and, more recently, viral pandemics. An exemplary vector will protect the nucleic acid payload from degradation and overcome a series of extracellular and intracellular barriers to enable efficient gene translation/transcription at the desired cell/tissue target. 1,2 Lipid nanoparticle (LNP) vectors formulated with an ionizable lipid, a PEGylated lipid, cholesterol, and a helper lipid have demonstrated clinical efficacy and safety in disease prevention and treatment, 3\u22125 most recently as vectors of mRNA vaccines. 6,7 Their rapid adoption is in no small part due to decades of earlier research 8\u221210 and the prior approval of Onpattro. 11 ne of the major challenges in developing LNP-based technologies is finding optimized lipid formulations for enhancing protein production, which are typically targetspecific, differing between various cells/tissues. \u221215 Changes in lipid type and composition alter their interactions and result in different nanostructures such as inverted micelles and invertedhexagonal, multiple-lamellar and amorphous phases for different formulations. 16 Moreover, the LNP nanostructure is related to its capacity for cellular uptake and release of the payload. 17,18 However, LNP development studies must rely on high-throughput screening work in vitro and in vivo due to the nature of multiple components and the complexity of LNP manufacturing. Thus, the rational design of LNP carriers, in the context of linking the structural features of key components to their functional roles and proposing target-specific adjust-ment, is a step forward for future LNP-based gene delivery applications. \n\nThe path to achieving the rational design of LNP carriers requires a better understanding of the LNP structures, which is the core of the LNP's formulation\u2212structure\u2212function relationship. The formulation mechanism of lipid nanocarriers and the structural phase transitions occurring upon encapsulation of nucleic acids have been previously investigated by synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) 19,20 and the component distributions across the LNP by SANS. 21,22 arious LNP structure models have been proposed by different techniques. 17,23",

            "text": "It appears that the immune function of LNPs exerts contrasting effects. Although it is advantageous when the immune activity of LNPs is positive, there is a possibility that adverse effects could arise as a result of immunological action. Since the immune system is very complex and has various mechanisms, a deeper understanding of the immune system is needed to determine how LNPs affect the body. Moreover, various techniques for controlling LNP effects on the immune system should be established. \n\nIn this review, we discuss innate immunity and acquired immunity and their relationship to understand the immune function of LNPs. We also examine the mechanism behind the immune action of lipid nanoparticles. As representative adverse effects of LNP, anaphylaxis, compaction activation-related pseudoallergy reaction (CARPA), and autoimmune disease will also be investigated, along with their mechanisms. Finally, we consider strategies for improving or impairing the immune effects of LNPs. Throughout the course of this review, readers will have the opportunity to thoughtfully evaluate techniques that can control and exploit the immunological activity of lipid nanoparticles.",

            "text": "Protein corona formation strongly affects cellular uptake mechanism, cell-nanoparticle interactions, intracellular location as well as cellular response (e.g., biocompatibility) [34,35,44]. The protein corona on the NP surface is hypothesised to hinder interactions of nanoparticle ligands and the targets on the cell surface [44,47]. \n\nThe study of Mirshafiee et al. [44] found that the protein corona formed on BCN-NPs (NPs functionalized with bicyclononyne) incubated in medium with 10% serum and 100% serum consisted of abundant proteins, such as chain A, a novel allosteric mechanism in haemoglobin, fetuin, haemoglobin foetal subunit beta or apolipoprotein A-II precursor. It was also reported that \u226588% of proteins in BCN-NP coronas had a molecular weight below 30 kDa. Even relatively low molecular weight proteins created corona that significantly reduced NP targeting efficiency [44]. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (HiPco\u00ae) were also found to interact with cell culture medium and its components. Casey et al. described that SWCNT interacted with the medium via physisorption through van der Waals forces [26,48]. \n\nThe process of protein corona formation has a decisive influence on nanoparticle-induced toxicity. For example, silica nanoparticles (AmSil30) precoated with human plasma caused lower cell-death induction in primary human endothelial cells and microvascular endothelial cell line (ISO-HAS1). The resulting effect was dependent on the time of corona formation. The most significant effect was recorded for the early corona, but prolonged incubation with plasma (>30 min) did not counteract membered toxicity [49]. In another example, thrombocytes were used to study the protein corona effect on the biological model. In the latter study, nanoparticles exposed to human plasma for 0.5 min did not activate thrombocytes to form aggregates due to the presence of the plasma protein corona [49].",

            "text": "The final LNP component, the PEG-lipid, is engineered to perform two specific functions. First, PEG-lipids incorporate into the emerging nanoparticle during LNP formation. As LNP systems do not contain an aqueous core, PEG-lipids reside almost exclusively on the LNP surface, and their concentrations control particle size [146]. Both the PEG molecular weight as well as the molar percentage of PEG-lipid affect the characteristics of lipid-based particles [147][148][149]. Specifically, as the PEG-lipid is increased from 0.25 mol% to 5 mol%, a reduction in LNP size is observed from~120 nm to 25 nm, but further increases to PEG-content do not modify particle size [24,147]. Second, they improve the shelf-stability by creating a steric barrier that extends away from the surface of the LNP, thereby preventing particle aggregation and improving in vivo circulation lifetimes. However, for transfection purposes, PEG-lipids have an established inhibitory effect [150,151]. Based on the hypothesized mechanism of LNP function, the nanoparticle requires an intricate balance between stability in storage and circulation, and instability within the cell to support intracellular delivery [152]. Diffusible PEG-lipids helped stabilize particles while enabling intracellular delivery [25,151]. These lipids are composed of acyl chains that are 14-carbons in length and can dissociate rapidly from the LNP in the circulation [153]. Two hours post administration, only 20% of the injected PEG-lipid is associated with the LNP. In contrast, PEG-lipids with 18-carbon acyl chains, incorporate into the LNP and do not dissociate from the particle in the circulation. At high concentrations, these PEG-lipids can contribute to extending circulation half-life (from < 30 minutes for diffusible PEG-lipid to > 2 hours) [23,153]. However, LNPs designed to target hepatic disorders do not require a prolonged circulation lifetime due to the liver's natural ability to sequester nanoparticles. Therefore, diffusible PEG-lipids are ideal for such",

            "text": "As we known that blood plasma contains roughly 3700 identified proteins and the protein concentration is approximately 60-80 g/L [167]. Once nanoparticles enter blood circulation system, the surafce of nanoparticles are inevitably encapsulated by proteins in the plasma to form the protein corona [168,169]. The impact of protein corona on the active targeting ability of nanoparticles is still controversial. Some studies reported that protein corona shielded the active part of the nanoparticle and inhibited the targeting ability of nanoparticle. For example, Mirshafiee et al. prepared fluorescent silica nanoparticles decorated with a strained cycloalkyne. Compared to bare nanoparticles, silica nanoparticles significantly decreased the targeting efficiencies by 94% and 99% after incubating with 10% or 100% serum, respectively [170]. Furthermore, small size targeting ligands such as aptamers are more easily shielded by the formed protein corona [171]. However, there are also many reports that the formation of protein corona did not affect the active targeting ability [172]. Even in the study of Caruso and collaborators, the protein corona was proven to facilitate specific targeting [173]. Gao group employed transferrin (Tf), a brain-targeting ligand, to modify nanoparticles to evaluate the specific targeting ability. The active targeting ability of Tf-modified nanoparticles is lost due to the formation of protein corona in vitro. Interestingly, despite protein corona was also formed in vivo, targeting ability of nanoparticles is partially preserved [174]. In conclusion, there is a huge different in the effects of protein corona on the active targeting ability. To overcome the issues of active targeting attenuation caused by the protein corona, researchers have explored many effective tactics, including reducing protein adsorption and recruiting specific proteins. Safavi-Sohi and colleagues prepared a novel silica nanoparticles decorated with biotin and cysteine. In this design, biotin served as the active targeting ligand while cysteine was used as a zwitterionic building block. Cysteine effectively reduced the adsorption of proteins on the nanoparticle surface and protected active targeting ligands [175].",

            "text": "One major problem with the intravenous administration of colloidal particles is their interaction with the reticulo-endothelial system (RES). Nanoparticles for medical applications are frequently given via parenteral administration. As with any foreign material, the body mounts a biological response to an administered nanoparticle. This response is the result of a complex interplay of factors, not just the intrinsic characteristics of the nanoparticle. In particular, most materials, upon contact with biological matrices, are immediately coated by proteins, leading to a protein \"corona\" [65]. Protein coronas are complex and variable. Certain components of the nanoparticle corona, called opsonins, may enhance uptake of the coated material by cells of the RES. The presence of opsonins on the particle surface creates a \"molecular signature\" which is recognized by immune cells and determines the route of particle internalization. The route of internalization affects the eventual fate of the nanoparticle in the body (i.e. its rate of clearance from the bloodstream, volume of distribution, organ disposition, and rate and route of clearance from the body). The cells of RES are capable of mopping up particles that they do not recognise as self i.e. particles they recognise as foreign. The negative effect can however, be remedied by linking of polyethylene glycol molecules to the lipid nanoparticles, thus increasing their hydrophilicity and the residence time of these particles in circulation. Alternatively, the lipid nanoparticles could be engineered to evade these RES cells by limiting the particle sizes to about 200 nm or less. It is believed that these cells do not recognise low nanometer-sized particles as foreign. Several other varied and unrelated challenges are encountered in lipid nanoparticle technology. These challenges constitute a serious research question which current strategies are targeted to address.",

In particular, it has been consistently shown that most LNPs are sequestered and degraded in lysosomes 12 or removed to extracellular space, 44 significantly limiting their therapeutic effects. 19,34 In addition, it is difficult to target nonhepatic organs with LNPs due to high liver tropism. It was demonstrated that spleen 21,25 and lung endothelium 28,29 can be targeted by modification of LNP formulations. Nonetheless, the use of LNPs with regards to non-hepatic delivery is still limited, and is the area of focus for next generation therapeutics.\n\nTypically, LNPs consist of four lipids: (1) cationic lipid, (2) PEG lipid, (3) cholesterol, and (4) structural lipid. The first component i.e. the cationic lipid is generally composed of a cationic head group and lipid tails, and is located in the core of LNPs with nucleic acids. This component is extensively explored because of its ability to assemble negatively charged nucleic acids into particles via electrostatic forces, and also in causing cytosolic release of nucleic acid by its interactions with the endosomal membrane. 1,10,16,45 The second component is the PEG lipid which possesses a PEG chain anchored to a lipid headgroup.

            "text": "Serum albumin (SA) has a broad perspective in the creation of bionanoconjugates with nanoparticles for the regulation of the protein assembly into fibrils and the disaggregation of preformed fibrils [14], as well as being an ideal candidate for nanoparticle formulation as potential controlled-release drug delivery systems [15]. In addition, SA has been used for surface coating and passivation in biological liquids [16,17] and as biosurfactants [18]. In turn, SA is used as a sensor of conformational changes when interacting with surfaces of various natures [19]. Such a range of possible applications of albumin is due to both the availability and cheapness of SAs and the relative completeness of knowledge [16,20,21] of their conformational state, intermolecular interaction, colloidal stability [22], and phase behavior in dispersions with different microenvironments. \n\nWhen the biological environment interacts with the surface, colloidal nanomaterials, nanoparticles, a dynamic coating of biomolecules, and proteins spontaneously arise around them, called the protein corona [19,23,24] (Figure 1). Irreversible or at least long-term binding of a protein by a nanoparticle leads to the formation of a \"hard corona\", whereas the rapidly reversible binding of a protein that has a higher turnover rate results in the formation of a \"soft corona\". The prospects for the wide use of nanoparticles in biomedicine [1,3] suggest the need to study this phenomenon since the toxicity of nanomaterials and the nanorisks of their use largely depend on the functioning of the corona. Blood plasma proteins, and in particular albumins, are the most important components in the formation of the protein corona, although the mechanism of its formation is complex and insufficiently studied [25], being a phase-regulating process. \n\nHighly organized protein molecules are edited by evolution to perform specific functions. However, other supramolecular structures and nanoparticles have been intensively introduced into living systems for possible adjustment of these functions.",

The formation of a protein corona changes the biological characteristics of nanoparticles, such as accumulation in tissues, cellular uptake, clearance by the immune system, and toxicity. It is extremely important to identify the type of proteins adsorbed on the surface of nanoparticles. Because, depending on their type, these proteins can either shorten or lengthen the circulation time of nanoparticles in the body [215]. Therefore, characterization of this protein layer will be a decisive step in the development of new nanomedicines [216]. At the same time, the understanding of the correlation between the physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles and protein adsorption is improving [217]. One of the first strategies is to reduce or prevent the formation of the protein corona using stealth systems. One of the most common surface modifications is PEGylation. Such systems also include polyvinylpyrrolidone, peptides, and carbohydrates. It is impossible to completely prevent protein corona, so the next strategy is modification with membrane components and to attach NP with specific ligands or biomolecules: antibodies, protein fragments, peptides, or membrane protein CD47 [218]. It is important to note that the phenomenon of protein corona formation becomes more complex in the case of protein-surface or protein-protein interactions [219]. Moreover, weak interactions stabilize NPs, and strong protein-protein interactions cause NP aggregation [220].",

The majority of applications of these NPs including e.g. imaging and targeted drug delivery involves blood contact. Once the NPs enter the body, they can trigger different reactions due to their interplay with blood components. 6 In blood, proteins attach immediately to the nanoparticle surface forming a so-called \"protein corona\", which defines the biological identity of the colloidal suspension. Such processes in the blood stream can lead to alterations of protein structures which may cause diseases through the ability to induce an immune response. 6,7 dditionally, the study of potential interaction of nanoparticles with cell membrane proteins is crucial for the design and development of highly effective and non-toxic NPs for biomedical applications. \n\nWhen NPs reach the target cells, they may either show no interaction with the cell membrane or can adhere to the membrane being further wrapped and subsequently internalized. 8,9 aked NPs with a high surface energy show strong adsorption to membranes as a result of unspecific interactions. Consequently, surface modification and corona formation lower their surface energy restricting the unspecific binding. 10,11 Lesniak et al. described the NP-membrane interaction as a two-step process starting with NP adhesion to the cell membrane and interaction with proteins and lipids followed by an energy-dependent internalization mechanism of the cell. 11 However, the scenario describing the biological system of nanoparticles and membranes interaction is much more complex. The NP corona not solely consists of abundant proteins; it comprises also complement proteins that activate the innate immune system. Therefore, opsonization and subsequent phagocytosis by immune cells are also present. 12 In addition, internalization of NPs can occur indirectly through diffusion, where NPs can penetrate cells by passive translocation or endocytosis pathways. A detailed description of interaction mechanisms can be found elsewhere. 13,14",

The presence of the corona enveloping the nanoparticle strongly affects the interplay with immune cells. The immune responses mediated by protein corona can affect nanoparticle toxicity and targeting capabilities. But the intracellular signaling of LNPs after corona formation resulting in the change of nanoparticles' ability to provoke immune responses remains unclear. Therefore, a more systematic and delineated approach must be considered to present the correlation between corona complexes and the shift in nanoparticle immunogenicity. Here, we studied and reported the inhibiting effect of the absorbed proteins on the LNPs on the NLRP3 inflammasome activation, a key intracellular protein complex that modulates several inflammatory responses. Ionizable lipid as a component of LNP was observed to play an important role in modulating the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in serum-free conditions. However, in the presence of serum proteins, the corona layer on LNPs caused a significant reduction in the inflammasome activation. Reduction in the lysosomal rupture after treatment with corona-LNPs significantly reduced inflammasome activation. Furthermore, a strong reduction of cellular uptake in macrophages after the corona formation was observed. On inspecting the uptake mechanisms in macrophages using transport inhibitors, lipid formulation was found to play a critical role in determining the endocytic pathways for the LNPs in macrophages. This study highlights the need to critically analyze the protein interactions with nanomaterials and their concomitant adaptability with immune cells to evaluate nano-bio surfaces and successfully design nanomaterials for biological applications.",

The protein corona that develops on the surface of nanoparticles after administration has garnered substantial attention due to the significant effects it has on their performance. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) depend on protein corona formation to mediate their targeting. Such protein\u2013nanoparticle interactions are often initially studied using in vitro cellular models aiming to eventually understand biodistribution and cargo delivery efficiency of the LNPs in vivo. For in vitro cell culture, fetal calf serum (FCS) is supplemented to culture media to provide nutrients and promote cell viability and growth. Heat inactivation of FCS is often performed to prevent complement system activation. However, the effect of this process on protein corona formation and, in turn, LNP functionality is unclear. Here, we investigated the effects of serum heat inactivation on protein corona formation on LNPs containing D-lin-MC3-DMA (MC3) or C12-200 (C12) ionizable lipids. Cellular uptake and siRNA delivery efficiency of the LNPs were determined in media containing untreated or heat-inactivated serum. Mechanistically, we found that apolipoprotein E, a protein corona component that is crucial for MC3 LNP tropism, displayed reduced stability and functionality upon heat inactivation of FCS, thereby negatively influencing uptake and cargo delivery of MC3 LNPs, but not C12 LNPs. Our results underline the importance of overlooked factors in in vitro experiments that can inadvertently affect LNP performance. These findings can help to improve protocols to study protein corona formation in vitro and prevent bias in LNP development.",

When added to subunit proteins, they have the potential to induce strong immune responses capable of generating long-lasting immunity. Merck has developed a variety of LNPs utilizing different cationic lipid components including LNP A, which has a long half-life in vivo, and LNP B, which has a shorter half-life in vivo and is more biodegradable. Protein subunit vaccines containing LNP A have been shown to generate robust antigen-specific humoral and cellular responses with some dose dependent reactogenicity while vaccines formulated with LNP B elicit lower immunogenicity and increased tolerability. To gain insight into the innate signaling pathways utilized by these LNPs, we performed an immunogenicity study in MyD88 knockout mice utilizing RSV F subunit protein vaccine plus LNP A or B. Wild type mice immunized with LNP A vaccines produced significantly higher levels of pro-inflammatory and neutrophil recruitment serum cytokines than the MyD88 knockout mice. However, with LNP B, MyD88 deficiency had no effect on cytokine expression. Humoral and cellular immune readouts are ongoing. Next, we stimulated whole human blood with the LNPs to compare at cytokine production. Stimulation with LNP A produced cytokine significant upregulation of monocyte and neutrophil-specific cytokines at 24 hours while stimulation with LNP B had no effect on cytokine production. Finally, we are evaluating differential gene expression to gain insight into the cellular responses of leukocytes to stimulation with the LNPs. Together, these experiments will help mechanistically determine how these fundamentally different LNPs can activate immune responses.",

            "abstract": "\n \n Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is characterized by the presence of chromosomal rearrangements that result in novel fusion-oncoproteins. Since fusion genes both initiate and maintain leukemia, they are cancer-specific therapeutic targets that are expressed in every single leukemic cell. We have developed a therapeutic siRNA approach by designing lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for the in vivo delivery of siRNAs to AML cells (Issa et al, 2023; Swart et al, 2023). We have now extended this approach to t(6;11)-positive AML that is associated with a dismal outcome in pediatric and adult AML. This translocation fuses the KMT2A (MLL) gene with the AFDN (AF6) gene, resulting in the dysregulation of the RAS pathway, aberrant gene expression and impaired differentiation.\n Here, we tested both an unmodified and a fully modified, 21-23 nucleotide, overhang siRNAs that successfully targets the KMT2A::AFDN gene fusion in AML cell lines and t(6;11) primary cells. Four different LNP formulations were tested, with changes both in lipid composition and molar ratios, to optimize knockdown efficiency. First, we assessed the delivery and knockdown efficiency using the Onpattro (Patisiran) LNP formulation, which consists of DLin-MC3-DMA, DSPC, cholesterol and DMG-PEG2000 at the molar ratios 50:10:38.5:1.5, respectively. Second, we utilized a LNP formulation where the cholesterol helper lipid was substituted with a naturally occurring phytosterol, namely \u03b2-sitosterol, at the same molar ratio as the standard formulation. Third, we tested an LNP formulation consisting of DLin-MC3-DMA, cholesterol, sphingomyelin and DSPC with molar ratios of 50:20:20:10. Lastly, we also tested a novel LNP formulation, which incorporates DLin-MC3-DMA, \u03b2-sitosterol, sphingomyelin and polysarcosine.\n Here, a 85% and 82% knockdown for the standard formulation, a 74% and 80% knockdown for the \u03b2-sitosterol formulation, a 76% and a 77% knockdown for the sphingomyelin formulation and a 83% and a 76% knockdown for the novel formulation were observed at a concentration of 2 \u00b5g/ml in SHI-1 cells over 48 hours when comparing the unmodified and modified siRNAs, respectively. These data indicates that knockdown efficacies are similar, while the fully modified siRNA only confers marginal increases in knockdown efficiency. As such, the choice of the optimal LNP for the treatment of AML will then depend on the pharmacokinetics and the ability of the LNPs to accumulate in the bone marrow in vivo.\n Additionally, the formation of the biomolecular protein corona upon serum exposure is an important factor mediating LNP efficiency. Serum proteins adsorbed to LNPs can facilitate LNP uptake and endosomal escape. We assessed both the association of LNPs encapsulating a cy5-labelled siRNA with SHI-1 and ML-2 cells in serum and in serum-free conditions using flow cytometry, and the knockdown efficiency. Both uptake of LNPs and knockdown were severely diminished over time in serum free conditions, and only 20% knockdown of KMT2A::AFDN was observed, suggesting that the protein corona facilitates LNP mode of action.\n To investigate whether our LNP-based siRNA delivery system targeting KMT2A::AFDN confers a functional effect on downstream targets, we assessed the expression of SHARP1. SHARP1 binds to transcriptionally active chromatin and activates gene expression critical for cell survival. Furthermore, SHARP1 cooperates with KMT2A::AFDN to regulate gene expression crucial for leukemogenesis, and mediates colony formation. Indeed, we report a 50% knockdown of SHARP1 in response to KMT2A::AFDN knockdown, while observing a 2-fold decrease in colony formation of SHI-1 cells. In addition, we assessed the expression of surface markers. Here, the expression of CD117 was decreased following KMT2A::AFDN knockdown, which indicates a shift to a more mature phenotype.\n Taken together, we successfully induced knockdown of KMT2A::AFDN in AML using different formulations of LNPs, a process which is mediated by the protein corona. We also gain insights into the downstream targeting of KMT2A::AFDN, where SHARP1 is downregulated upon KMT2A::AFDN knockdown, which is mediated through the loss of DOT1L activity. Furthermore, the colony formation was decreased following KMT2A::AFDN knockdown, which is in line with the loss of SHARP1. As such, the knockdown of KMT2A::AFDN with LNPs shows great potential in the treatment of t(6;11) AML.\n",

However, the effective application of nanomaterials is hampered by limited understanding and control over their interactions with complex biological systems. When a nanomaterial enters a physiological environment, it rapidly adsorbs proteins forming what is known as the protein 'corona'. The protein corona alters the size and interfacial composition of a nanomaterial, giving it a biological identity that is distinct from its synthetic identity. The biological identity determines the physiological response including signalling, kinetics, transport, accumulation, and toxicity. The structure and composition of the protein corona depends on the synthetic identity of the nanomaterial (size, shape, and composition), the nature of the physiological environment (blood, interstitial fluid, cell cytoplasm, etc.), and the duration of exposure. In this critical review, we discuss the formation of the protein corona, its structure and composition, and its influence on the physiological response. We also present an 'adsorbome' of 125 plasma proteins that are known to associate with nanomaterials. We further describe how the protein corona is related to the synthetic identity of a nanomaterial, and highlight efforts to control protein-nanomaterial interactions. We conclude by discussing gaps in the understanding of protein-nanomaterial interactions along with strategies to fill them (167 references)."

Eventually equilibrium is reached, at which point the continued exchange will not affect the composition of the corona. Results We developed a simple and effective dynamic model of the nanoparticle protein corona in a body fluid, namely human plasma. The model predicts the time evolution and equilibrium composition of the corona based on affinities, stoichiometries and rate constants. An application to the interaction of human serum albumin, high density lipoprotein (HDL) and fibrinogen with 70 nm N-iso-propylacrylamide/N-tert-butylacrylamide copolymer nanoparticles is presented, including novel experimental data for HDL.

This corona is, when sufficiently long-lived, thought to govern the particles' biological fate. However, even this long-lived \"hard\" corona evolves and re-equilibrates as particles pass from one biological fluid to another, and may be an important feature for long-term fate. Here we show the evolution of the protein corona as a result of transfer of nanoparticles from one biological fluid (plasma) into another (cytosolic fluid), a simple illustrative model for the uptake of nanoparticles into cells. While no direct comparison can be made to what would happen in, for example, the uptake pathway, the results confirm that significant evolution of the corona occurs in the second biological solution, but that the final corona contains a \"fingerprint\" of its history. This could be evolved to map the transport pathways utilized by nanoparticles, and eventually to predict nanoparticle fate and behavior.",

This corona may be expressed as a durable, stabilizing coating of the bare surface of nanoparticle (NP) monomers, or it may be reflected in different subpopulations of particle assemblies, each presenting a durable protein coating. Using the approach and concepts of physical chemistry, we relate studies on the composition of the protein corona at different plasma concentrations with structural data on the complexes both in situ and free from excess plasma. This enables a high degree of confidence in the meaning of the hard protein corona in a biological context. Here, we present the protein adsorption for two compositionally different NPs, namely sulfonated polystyrene and silica NPs. NP-protein complexes are characterized by differential centrifugal sedimentation, dynamic light scattering, and zeta-potential both in situ and once isolated from plasma as a function of the protein/NP surface area ratio. We then introduce a semiquantitative determination of their hard corona composition using one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrospray liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, which allows us to follow the total binding isotherms for the particles, identifying simultaneously the nature and amount of the most relevant proteins as a function of the plasma concentration. We find that the hard corona can evolve quite significantly as one passes from protein concentrations appropriate to in vitro cell studies to those present in in vivo studies, which has deep implications for in vitro-in vivo extrapolations and will require some consideration in the future.",

Currently, there is limited understanding and connection between the physicochemical properties of a nanomaterial and its interactions with a physiological system. As a result, it remains unclear how to optimally synthesize and chemically modify nanomaterials for in vivo applications. It has been suggested that the physicochemical properties of a nanomaterial after synthesis, known as its \"synthetic identity\", are not what a cell encounters in vivo. Adsorption of blood components and interactions with phagocytes can modify the size, aggregation state, and interfacial composition of a nanomaterial, giving it a distinct \"biological identity\". Here, we investigate the role of size and surface chemistry in mediating serum protein adsorption to gold nanoparticles and their subsequent uptake by macrophages. Using label-free liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, we find that over 70 different serum proteins are heterogeneously adsorbed to the surface of gold nanoparticles. The relative density of each of these adsorbed proteins depends on nanoparticle size and poly(ethylene glycol) grafting density. Variations in serum protein adsorption correlate with differences in the mechanism and efficiency of nanoparticle uptake by a macrophage cell line. Macrophages contribute to the poor efficiency of nanomaterial delivery into diseased tissues, redistribution of nanomaterials within the body, and potential toxicity.

Under in vitro cell culture conditions, zeta potential measurements, UV-vis spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscope analysis were used to monitor the time evolution of the inorganic NP-protein corona formation and to characterize the stability of the NPs and their surface state at every stage of the experiment. As expected, the red-shift of the surface plasmon resonance peak, as well as the drop of surface charge and the increase of the hydrodynamic diameter indicated the conjugation of proteins to NPs. Remarkably, an evolution from a loosely attached toward an irreversible attached protein corona over time was observed. Mass spectrometry of the digested protein corona revealed albumin as the most abundant component which suggests an improved biocompatibility."

Liposomes composed of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) or hydrogenated soybean phosphatidylcholine (HSPC) with 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1\u2032-rac-glycerol) (sodium salt) (DPPG), 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[methoxy(polyethylene glycol)-3000] (DPPE-PEG 3000), cholesterol (CH) or mixtures of these lipids, were prepared at different concentrations by the thin-film hydration method. After liposomes were dispersed in HPLC-grade water and foetal bovine serum (FBS), their physicochemical characteristics, such as size, size distribution, and \u03b6-potential, were determined using dynamic and electrophoretic light scattering. Aggregation of DPPC, HSPC, DPPC:CH (9:1 molar ratio), and HSPC:CH (9:1 molar ratio) in FBS was observed. On the contrary, liposomes incorporating DPPG lipids and CH both in a molar ratio of 11% were found to be stable over time, while their size did not alter dramatically in biological medium. Liposomes containing CH and PEGylated lipids retain their size in the presence of serum as well as their physical stability. In addition, our results indicate that the protein binding depends on the presence of polyethylene glycol (PEG), CH, concentration and surface charge. In this paper, we introduce a new parameter, fraction of stealthiness (Fs), for investigating the extent of protein binding to liposomes. This parameter depends on the changes in size of liposomes after serum incubation, while liposomes have stealth properties when Fs is close to 1. Thus, we conclude that lipid composition and concentration affect the adsorption of proteins and the liposomal stabilization."

Coronas, in particular the protein corona, play an important role in determining the surface properties of particles and their targeting abilities. This study examines the influence of protein coronas on the targeting ability of layer-by-layer (LbL)-assembled polymer capsules and core-shell particles functionalized with monoclonal antibodies. Upon exposure of humanized A33 monoclonal antibody (huA33 mAb)-functionalized poly(methacrylic acid) (PMA) capsules or huA33 mAb-PMA particles to human serum, a total of 83 or 65 proteins were identified in the protein coronas, respectively. Human serum of varying concentrations altered the composition of the protein corona. The antibody-driven specific cell membrane binding was qualitatively and quantitatively assessed by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy in both the absence and presence of a protein corona. The findings show that although different protein coronas formed in human serum (at different concentrations), the targeting ability of both the huA33 mAb-functionalized PMA capsules and particles toward human colon cancer cells was retained, demonstrating no significant difference compared with capsules and particles in the absence of protein coronas: \u223c70% and \u223c90% A33-expressing cells were targeted by the huA33 mAb-PMA capsules and particles, respectively, in a mixed cell population. This result demonstrates that the formation of protein coronas did not significantly influence the targeting ability of antibody-functionalized LbL-polymer carriers, indicating that the surface functionality of engineered particles in the presence of protein coronas can be preserved.",

However, the effective application of nanomaterials is hampered by limited understanding and control over their interactions with complex biological systems. When a nanomaterial enters a physiological environment, it rapidly adsorbs proteins forming what is known as the protein 'corona'. The protein corona alters the size and interfacial composition of a nanomaterial, giving it a biological identity that is distinct from its synthetic identity. The biological identity determines the physiological response including signalling, kinetics, transport, accumulation, and toxicity. The structure and composition of the protein corona depends on the synthetic identity of the nanomaterial (size, shape, and composition), the nature of the physiological environment (blood, interstitial fluid, cell cytoplasm, etc.), and the duration of exposure. In this critical review, we discuss the formation of the protein corona, its structure and composition, and its influence on the physiological response. We also present an 'adsorbome' of 125 plasma proteins that are known to associate with nanomaterials. We further describe how the protein corona is related to the synthetic identity of a nanomaterial, and highlight efforts to control protein-nanomaterial interactions. We conclude by discussing gaps in the understanding of protein-nanomaterial interactions along with strategies to fill them (167 references).",

Currently, there is limited understanding and connection between the physicochemical properties of a nanomaterial and its interactions with a physiological system. As a result, it remains unclear how to optimally synthesize and chemically modify nanomaterials for in vivo applications. It has been suggested that the physicochemical properties of a nanomaterial after synthesis, known as its \"synthetic identity\", are not what a cell encounters in vivo. Adsorption of blood components and interactions with phagocytes can modify the size, aggregation state, and interfacial composition of a nanomaterial, giving it a distinct \"biological identity\". Here, we investigate the role of size and surface chemistry in mediating serum protein adsorption to gold nanoparticles and their subsequent uptake by macrophages. Using label-free liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, we find that over 70 different serum proteins are heterogeneously adsorbed to the surface of gold nanoparticles. The relative density of each of these adsorbed proteins depends on nanoparticle size and poly(ethylene glycol) grafting density. Variations in serum protein adsorption correlate with differences in the mechanism and efficiency of nanoparticle uptake by a macrophage cell line. Macrophages contribute to the poor efficiency of nanomaterial delivery into diseased tissues, redistribution of nanomaterials within the body, and potential toxicity. This study establishes principles for the rational design of clinically useful nanomaterials."

These vesicles are widely used in small-molecule drug and nucleic acid delivery and recently gained much attention because of their remarkable success as a delivery platform for COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. Nonetheless, the utility of transient protein expression induced by mRNA extends far beyond vaccines against infectious diseases\u2500they also hold promise as cancer vaccines, protein replacement therapies, and gene editing components for rare genetic diseases. However, naked mRNA is inherently unstable and prone to rapid degradation by nucleases and self-hydrolysis. Encapsulation of mRNA within LNPs protects mRNA from extracellular ribonucleases and assists with intracellular mRNA delivery.In this Account, we discuss the core features of LNPs for RNA delivery. We focus our attention on LNPs designed to deliver mRNA; however, we also include examples of siRNA-LNP delivery where appropriate to highlight the commonalities and the dissimilarities due to the nucleic acid structure. First, we introduce the concept of LNPs, the advantages and disadvantages of utilizing nucleic acids as therapeutic agents, and the general reasoning behind the molecular makeup of LNPs. We also briefly highlight the most recent clinical successes of LNP-based nucleic acid therapies. Second, we describe the theory and methods of LNP self-assembly. The common idea behind all of the preparation methods is inducing electrostatic interactions between the nucleic acid and charged lipids and promoting nanoparticle growth via hydrophobic interactions. Third, we break down the LNP composition with special attention to the fundamental properties and purposes of each component. This includes the identified molecular design criteria, commercial sourcing, impact on intracellular trafficking, and contribution to the properties of LNPs. One of the key components of LNPs is ionizable lipids, which initiate electrostatic binding with endosomal membranes and facilitate cytosolic release; however, the roles of other lipid components should not be disregarded, as they are associated with stability, clearance, and distribution of LNPs. Fourth, we review the attributes of LNP constructs as a whole that can heavily influence RNA delivery. These attributes are LNP size, charge, internal structure, lipid packing, lipid membrane hydration, stability, and affinity toward biomacromolecules. We also discuss the specific techniques used to examine these attributes and how they can be adjusted. Finally, we offer our perspective on the future of RNA therapies and some questions that remain in the realm of LNP formulation and optimization.",

Using a series of lipid nanoparticles with distinct organ-targeting properties, we provide evidence for a plausible mechanism of action for nanoparticle delivery to non-liver tissues. Following intravenous injection, specific proteins in the blood are recruited to the nanoparticle\u2019s surface based on its molecular composition and they endow it with a unique biological identity that governs its ultimate fate in the body. An innovative paradigm emerges from this mechanistic understanding of nanoparticle delivery\u2014endogenous targeting\u2014wherein the molecular composition of a nanoparticle is rationally engineered to interact with specific proteins in the blood to overcome liver accumulation and to target specific organs. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a clinically mature technology for the delivery of genetic medicines but have limited therapeutic applications due to liver accumulation. Recently, our laboratory developed selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles that expand the therapeutic applications of genetic medicines by enabling delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) and gene editing systems to non-liver tissues. SORT nanoparticles include a supplemental SORT molecule whose chemical structure determines the LNP\u2019s tissue-specific activity. To understand how SORT nanoparticles surpass the delivery barrier of liver hepatocyte accumulation, we studied the mechanistic factors which define their organ-targeting properties. We discovered that the chemical nature of the added SORT molecule controlled biodistribution, global/apparent pKa, and serum protein interactions of SORT nanoparticles. Additionally, we provide evidence for an endogenous targeting mechanism whereby organ targeting occurs via 1) desorption of poly(ethylene glycol) lipids from the LNP surface, 2) binding of distinct proteins to the nanoparticle surface because of recognition of exposed SORT molecules, and 3) subsequent interactions between surface-bound proteins and cognate receptors highly expressed in specific tissues. These findings establish a crucial link between the molecular composition of SORT nanoparticles and their unique and precise organ-targeting properties and suggest that the recruitment of specific proteins to a nanoparticle\u2019s surface can enable drug delivery beyond the liver.",

However, it is currently impossible to rationally design nanoparticles that selectively target specific tissues. Here, we report a strategy termed selective organ targeting (SORT) wherein multiple classes of lipid nanoparticles are systematically engineered to exclusively edit extrahepatic tissues via addition of a supplemental SORT molecule. Lung-, spleen- and liver-targeted SORT lipid nanoparticles were designed to selectively edit therapeutically relevant cell types including epithelial cells, endothelial cells, B cells, T cells and hepatocytes. SORT is compatible with multiple gene editing techniques, including mRNA, Cas9 mRNA/single guide RNA and Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complexes, and is envisioned to aid the development of protein replacement and gene correction therapeutics in targeted tissues. The addition of selective organ targeting molecules to nanoparticles allows the specific targeting of extrahepatic tissues, enabling gene editing of distinct cell populations outside the liver."

Unfortunately, opsonins are also adsorbed. These proteins are immediately recognized by the phagocyte system with rapid clearance of the NPs from the bloodstream. Polyethyleneglycol (PEG) coating of NPs (PEGylation) is the most efficient anti-opsonization strategy. Linear chains of PEG, grafted onto the NP surface, are able to create steric hindrance, resulting in a significant inhibition of protein adsorption and less recognition by macrophages. However, excessive PEGylation can lead to a strong inhibition of cellular uptake and less efficient binding with protein targets, reducing the potential of the delivery system. To reach a compromise in this regard we employed a multi-component (MC) lipid system with uncommon properties of cell uptake and endosomal escape and increasing length of PEG chains. Nano liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS/MS) analysis allowed us to accurately determine the corona composition showing that apolipoproteins are the most abundant class in the corona and that increasing the PEG length reduced the protein adsorption and the liposomal surface affinity for apolipoproteins. Due to the abundance of apolipoproteins, we exploited the \"protein corona effect\" to deliver cationic liposome-human plasma complexes to human prostate cancer PC3 cells that express a high level of scavenger receptor class B type 1 in order to evaluate the cellular uptake efficiency of the systems used. Combining laser scanning confocal microscopy with flow cytometry analysis in PC3 cells we demonstrated that MC-PEG2k is the best compromise between an anti-opsonization strategy and active targeting and could be a promising candidate to treat prostate cancer in vivo."

Data sets collected in this field of study include some toxico- and pharmacodynamic properties (e.g., distribution and metabolism) but many studies lack information about adsorption of biological molecules or absorption into cells. When nanoparticles are suspended in blood serum, a protein corona cloud forms around its surface. The extent of the applications and implications of this formed cloud are unknown. Some researchers have speculated that the successful use of nanoparticles in pharmaceutical treatments relies on a comprehensive understanding of the protein corona composition. The work presented in this paper uses a suite of data analytics and multi-variant visualization techniques to elucidate particle-to-protein interactions at the molecular level. Through mass spectrometry analyses, corona proteins were identified through large and complex datasets. With such high-output analyses, complex datasets pose a challenge when visualizing and communicating nanoparticle-protein interactions. Thus, the creation of a streamlined visualization method is necessary. A series of user-friendly data informatics techniques were used to demonstrate the data flow of protein corona characteristics. Multi-variant heat maps, pie charts, tables, and three-dimensional regression analyses were used to improve results interpretation, facilitate an iterative data transfer process, and emphasize features of the nanoparticle-protein corona system that might be controllable. Data informatics successfully highlights the differences between protein corona compositions and how they relate to nanoparticle surface charge.",

This is mainly due to a lack of sufficient NPs characterization as synthesized as well as in operando. Many characteristics of NPs may be affected by the chemistry of their surroundings and the presence of inorganic and biological moieties. Consequently, understanding the behavior of NPs at the time of toxicological assay may play a crucial role in the interpretation of its results.The present study examines changes in properties of differently functionalized fluorescent 50\u00a0nm silica NPs in a variety of environments and assesses their ability to absorb proteins from cell culture medium containing either bovine or human serum.MethodsThe colloidal stability depending on surface functionalization of NPs, their concentration and time of exposure was investigated in water, standard biological buffers, and cell culture media by dynamic light scattering (DLS), zeta potential measurements and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Interactions of the particles with biological media were investigated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) in bovine and human serum, and extracted proteins were assessed using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight technique (MALDI-TOF).ResultsIt was recognized that all of the studied silica NPs tended to agglomerate after relatively short time in buffers and biological media. The agglomeration depended not only on the NPs functionalization but also on their concentration and the incubation time. Agglomeration was much diminished in a medium containing serum. The protein corona formation depended on time and functionalization of NP, and varied significantly in different types of serum.ConclusionsSurface charge, ionic strength and biological molecules alter the properties of silica NPs and potentially affect their biological effects. The NPs surface in bovine serum and in human serum varies significantly, and it changes with incubation time. Consequently, the human serum, rather than the animal serum, should be used while conducting in vitro or in vivo studies concerning humans. Moreover, there is a need to pre-incubate NPs in the serum to control the composition of the bio-nano-composite that would be present in the human body.",

The composition of soft corona (SC) proteins and their biological relevance have remained elusive due to the lack of analytical separation methods. Here, we identify a set of specific corona proteins with weak interactions at silica and polystyrene nanoparticles by using an in situ click-chemistry reaction. We show that these SC proteins are present also in the HC, but are specifically enriched after the capture, suggesting that the main distinction between HC and SC is the differential binding strength of the same proteins. Interestingly, the weakly interacting proteins are revealed as modulators of nanoparticle-cell association mainly through their dynamic nature. We therefore highlight that weak interactions of proteins at nanoparticles should be considered when evaluating nano-bio interfaces. Understanding the biological identity of nanoparticles has mainly focused on the hard protein corona with the soft corona largely overlooked. Here, using click-chemistry, the authors report on a capture system for the identification of the soft corona proteins and investigate the effects on cell interactions.",

BC treatment mainly depends on the identification of the specific subtype. Despite the correct identification, therapies could fail in some patients. Thus, further insights into the genetic and molecular status of the different BC subtypes could be very useful to improve the response of BC patients to the range of available therapies. In this way, we used gold nanoparticles (AuNPs, 12.96 \u00b1 0.72 nm) as a scavenging tool in combination with Sequential Window Acquisition of All Theoretical Mass Spectra (SWATH-MS) to quantitatively analyze the serum proteome alterations in the different breast cancer intrinsic subtypes. The differentially regulated proteins specific of each subtype were further analyzed with the bioinformatic tools STRING and PANTHER to identify the major molecular function, biological processes, cellular origin, protein class and biological pathways altered due to the heterogeneity in proteome of the different BC subtypes. Importantly, a profile of blood coagulation proteins was identified in the serum of HER2-overexpressing BC patients.",

EVs were subjected to differential centrifugation, size exclusion chromatography, or density gradient ultracentrifugation followed by mass spectrometry. Plasma protein\u2010coated EVs had a higher density compared to the nascent ones and carried numerous newly associated proteins. Interactions between plasma proteins and EVs were confirmed by confocal microscopy, capillary Western immunoassay, immune electron microscopy and flow cytometry. We identified nine shared EV corona proteins (ApoA1, ApoB, ApoC3, ApoE, complement factors 3 and 4B, fibrinogen \u03b1\u2010chain, immunoglobulin heavy constant \u03b32 and \u03b34 chains), which appear to be common corona proteins among EVs, viruses and artificial nanoparticles in blood plasma. An unexpected finding of this study was the high overlap of the composition of the protein corona with blood plasma protein aggregates.

However, specific issues arise when working with these entities, whose size and amount often make them difficult to obtain as relatively pure preparations, and to characterize properly. The International Society for Extracellular Vesicles (ISEV) proposed Minimal Information for Studies of Extracellular Vesicles (\u201cMISEV\u201d) guidelines for the field in 2014. We now update these \u201cMISEV2014\u201d guidelines based on evolution of the collective knowledge in the last four years. An important point to consider is that ascribing a specific function to EVs in general, or to subtypes of EVs, requires reporting of specific information beyond mere description of function in a crude, potentially contaminated, and heterogeneous preparation. For example, claims that exosomes are endowed with exquisite and specific activities remain difficult to support experimentally, given our still limited knowledge of their specific molecular machineries of biogenesis and release, as compared with other biophysically similar EVs. The MISEV2018 guidelines include tables and outlines of suggested protocols and steps to follow to document specific EV-associated functional activities.

                    "[195696648 | Degors et al. | 2019 | Citations: 281]": "Conspectus Over the past decades, major efforts were undertaken to develop devices on a nanoscale level for the efficient and nontoxic delivery of molecules to tissues and cells, for the purpose of either diagnosis or treatment of disease. The application of such devices in drug delivery has proven to be beneficial for matters as diverse as drug solubility, drug targeting, controlled drug release, and transport of drugs across cellular barriers. Multiple nanotherapeutics have been approved for clinical treatment, and more products are being evaluated in preclinical and clinical trials. However, many biological barriers hinder the medical application of nanocarriers. There are two main classes of barriers that need to be overcome by drug nanocarriers: extracellular and intracellular barriers, both of which may capture and/or destroy therapeutics before they reach their target site. This Account discusses major biological barriers that are confronted by nanotherapeutics, following their systemic administration, focusing on cellular entry and endosomal escape of gene delivery vectors. The use of pH-responsive materials to overcome the endosomal barrier is addressed. Historically, cell biologists have studied the interaction between cells and pathogens in order to unveil the mechanisms of endocytosis and cell signaling. Meanwhile, it is becoming clear that cells may respond in similar ways to artificial drug delivery systems and, consequently, that knowledge on the cellular response against both pathogens and nanoparticulate systems will aid in the design of improved nanomedicine. A close collaboration between bioengineers and cell biologists will promote this development. At the same time, we have come to realize that tools that we use to study fundamental cellular processes, including metabolic inhibitors of endocytosis and overexpression/downregulation of proteins, may cause changes in cellular physiology. This calls for the implementation of refined methods to study nanocarrier\u2013cell interactions, as is discussed in this Account. Finally, recent papers on the dynamics of cargo release from endosomes by means of live cell imaging have significantly advanced our understanding of the transfection process. They have initiated discussion (among others) on the limited number of endosomal escape events in transfection, and on the endosomal stage at which genetic cargo is most efficiently released. Advancements in imaging techniques, including super-resolution microscopy, in concert with techniques to label endogenous proteins and/or label proteins with synthetic fluorophores, will contribute to a more detailed understanding of nanocarrier-cell dynamics, which is imperative for the development of safe and efficient nanomedicine.",

Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are one of the most successful RNA delivery systems. However, expanding their application hinges on the discovery of next generation LNPs with high potency, cyto-specific targeting, and low side effects. Overcoming the difficulty of releasing cargo from endocytosed LNPs remains a significant hurdle. The endosomal escape of viral and non-viral nanoparticles relies on the topological transformation of membrane fusion pore formation followed by RNA translocation into the cytosol. In this study we show that LNP-RNA nanostructure modulates the energetic cost of LNP fusion with a target membrane. The inclusion of a new class of structurally-active lipids leads to superior LNP endosomal fusion, fast evasion of endosomal entrapment, and efficacious RNA delivery. Specifically, bicontinuous cubic RNA-LNPs, cuboplexes, have significantly higher endosomal escape rates and deliver more RNA compared to regular lamellar LNPs.",

Release from monovalent[1,2-dioleoyl-3(1)-1(trimethylammonio)propane] or multivalent (dioctadecylamidoglycylspermine) lipids was quantified by an increase of ethidium bromide (EtBr) fluorescence. Plasmid sensitivity to DNAse I degradation was examined using changes in plasmid migration on agarose gel electrophoresis. Physical separation of the DNA from the cationic lipid was confirmed and quantified on sucrose density gradients. Anionic liposomes containing compositions that mimic the cytoplasmic-facing monolayer of the plasma membrane (e.g. phosphatidylserine) rapidly released DNA from the complex. Release occurred near a 1/1 charge ratio (-/+) and was unaffected by ionic strength or ion type. Water soluble molecules with a high negative linear charge density such as dextran sulfate or heparin also released DNA. However, ionic water soluble molecules such as ATP, tRNA, DNA, poly(glutamic acid), spermidine, spermine, or histone did not, even at 100-fold charge excess (-/+). On the basis of these results, we propose that after the cationic lipid/DNA complex is internalized into cells by endocytosis it destabilizes the endosomal membrane. Destabilization induces flip-flop of anionic lipids from the cytoplasmic-facing monolayer, which laterally diffuse into the complex and form a charge neutral ion pair with the cationic lipids. This results in displacement of the DNA from the cationic lipid and release of the DNA into cytoplasm. This mechanism accounts for a variety of observations on cationic lipid/DNA complex-cell interactions."

This corona may impede targeted efficacy by shielding surface ligands necessary for specific cell or receptor recognition. Surface-exposed PEGylated lipids play a crucial role in determining and regulating the composition of the corona proteins on LNPs. Parallelly, the compositions of the corona proteins can govern the distributions of the nanoparticles due to the organ-specific accumulations of the serum proteins, such as ApoE for the liver and complementary system-related proteins for the spleen.\n\nIn a recent study, Chen et al. [70] investigated the role of apolipoprotein-and vitronectin-enriched corona on LNPs for targeted delivery and transfection of oligonucleotides in murine tumor models. A slight change in the physicochemical properties of LNPs altered the corona pattern. For instance, the introduction of positive charge via cationic lipid 3\u03b2-{N-[2-(dimethylamino) ethyl]carbamoyl}cholesterol (DC-cholesterol) as a substitution for original cholesterol shifted the protein corona pattern from apolipoprotein-rich to vitronectin-rich.",

Detailed analysis of nanoparticle protein corona is gradually revealing the \"missing link\" between nanoparticle chemical properties and the biological identity. Nevertheless, the discovery of nanoparticle protein corona's impact on tumor delivery is limited. In this study, we demonstrate that protein corona can be manipulated by formulation composition and particle surface charge changes, and a single lipid switch could switch the nanoparticle protein corona profile. The protein corona composition differences had a profound impact on cell transfection, in vivo biodistribution as well as tumor-specific delivery efficiency. Nanoparticles with apolipoprotein-rich corona showed better delivery to hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) as compared to those with vitronectin-rich corona. In addition, we found that, the PEG conjugated lipid chain length and PEG amount in LNPs were key factors to consider in successful RNA interference therapy for solid tumors."

Parallelly, the compositions of the corona proteins can govern the distributions of the nanoparticles due to the organ-specific accumulations of the serum proteins, such as ApoE for the liver and complementary system-related proteins for the spleen.\n\nIn a recent study, Chen et al. [70] investigated the role of apolipoprotein-and vitronectin-enriched corona on LNPs for targeted delivery and transfection of oligonucleotides in murine tumor models. A slight change in the physicochemical properties of LNPs altered the corona pattern. For instance, the introduction of positive charge via cationic lipid 3\u03b2-{N-[2-(dimethylamino) ethyl]carbamoyl}cholesterol (DC-cholesterol) as a substitution for original cholesterol shifted the protein corona pattern from apolipoprotein-rich to vitronectin-rich."

Using a series of lipid nanoparticles with distinct organ-targeting properties, we provide evidence for a plausible mechanism of action for nanoparticle delivery to non-liver tissues. Following intravenous injection, specific proteins in the blood are recruited to the nanoparticle\u2019s surface based on its molecular composition and they endow it with a unique biological identity that governs its ultimate fate in the body. An innovative paradigm emerges from this mechanistic understanding of nanoparticle delivery\u2014endogenous targeting\u2014wherein the molecular composition of a nanoparticle is rationally engineered to interact with specific proteins in the blood to overcome liver accumulation and to target specific organs. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a clinically mature technology for the delivery of genetic medicines but have limited therapeutic applications due to liver accumulation. Recently, our laboratory developed selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles that expand the therapeutic applications of genetic medicines by enabling delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) and gene editing systems to non-liver tissues. SORT nanoparticles include a supplemental SORT molecule whose chemical structure determines the LNP\u2019s tissue-specific activity. To understand how SORT nanoparticles surpass the delivery barrier of liver hepatocyte accumulation, we studied the mechanistic factors which define their organ-targeting properties. We discovered that the chemical nature of the added SORT molecule controlled biodistribution, global/apparent pKa, and serum protein interactions of SORT nanoparticles. Additionally, we provide evidence for an endogenous targeting mechanism whereby organ targeting occurs via 1) desorption of poly(ethylene glycol) lipids from the LNP surface, 2) binding of distinct proteins to the nanoparticle surface because of recognition of exposed SORT molecules, and 3) subsequent interactions between surface-bound proteins and cognate receptors highly expressed in specific tissues. These findings establish a crucial link between the molecular composition of SORT nanoparticles and their unique and precise organ-targeting properties and suggest that the recruitment of specific proteins to a nanoparticle\u2019s surface can enable drug delivery beyond the liver."

The protein corona (PC), the set of proteins binding to the NPs surface, plays a critical role in particle recognition by the innate immune system.

But the protein binding can actually be controlled by altering PC both in vitro and in vivo. Analyzing PC in vivo could accordingly provide a deep understanding of its biological effect and speed up the transfer to clinical applications.

In the two decades since the protein corona was identified, the importance of nanoparticles surface properties in regulating biological responses have been recognized. However, there is still a lack of clarity about the relationships between physiological conditions and corona composition over time, and how this controls biological activities/interactions. Here we review recent progress in characterizing the structure and composition of protein corona as a function of biological fluid and time. We summarize the influence of nanoparticle characteristics on protein corona composition and discuss the relevance of protein corona to the biological activity and fate of nanoparticles. The aim is to provide a critical summary of the key factors that affect protein corona formation (e.g. characteristics of nanoparticles and biological environment) and how the corona modulates biological activity, cellular uptake, biodistribution, and drug delivery. In addition to a discussion on the importance of the characterization of protein corona adsorbed on nanoparticle surfaces under conditions that mimic relevant physiological environment, we discuss the unresolved technical issues related to the characterization of nanoparticle-protein corona complexes during their journey in the body. Lastly, the paper offers a perspective on how the existing nanomaterial toxicity data obtained from in vitro studies should be reconsidered in the light of the presence of a protein corona, and how recent advances in fields, such as proteomics and machine learning can be integrated into the quantitative analysis of protein corona components."

To explore this we analyze naturally efficacious biocorona compositions using an unbiased screening workflow. First, LNPs are complexed with plasma samples, from individual lean or obese male rats, and then functionally evaluated in vitro. Then, a fast, automated, and miniaturized method retrieves the LNPs with intact biocoronas, and multiomics analysis of the LNP-corona complexes reveals the particle corona content arising from each individual plasma sample. We find that the most efficacious LNP-corona complexes were enriched with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and, compared to the commonly used corona-biomarker Apolipoprotein E, corona HDL content was a superior predictor of in-vivo activity. Using technically challenging and clinically relevant lipid nanoparticles, these methods reveal a previously unreported role for HDL as a source of ApoE and, form a framework for improving LNP therapeutic efficacy by controlling corona composition."

To efficiently deliver the nucleic acid payload to its target tissue, the genetic material needs to be combined with a delivery platform. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have proven to be excellent delivery vectors for gene therapy and are increasingly entering into routine clinical practice. Over the past two decades, the optimization of LNP formulations for nucleic acid delivery has led to a well-established body of knowledge culminating in the first-ever RNA interference therapeutic using LNP technology, i.e. Onpattro\u00ae, and many more in clinical development to deliver various nucleic acid payloads. Screening a lipid library in vivo for optimal gene silencing potency in hepatocytes resulted in the identification of the Onpattro\u00ae formulation. Subsequent studies discovered that the key to Onpattro\u00ae's liver tropism is its ability to form a specific \"biomolecular corona\". In fact, apolipoprotein E (ApoE), among other proteins, adsorbed to the LNP surface enables specific hepatocyte targeting. This proof-of-principle example demonstrates the use of the biomolecular corona for targeting specific receptors and cells, thereby opening up the road to rationally designing LNPs. To date, however, only a few studies have explored in detail the corona of LNPs and how to efficiently modulate the corona remains poorly understood. In this review, we summarize recent discoveries about the biomolecular corona, expanding the knowledge gained with other nanoparticles to LNPs for nucleic acid delivery. In particular, we address how particle stability, biodistribution, and targeting of LNPs can be influenced by the biological environment. Onpattro\u00ae is used as a case study to describe both the successful development of an LNP formulation for gene therapy and the key influence of the biological environment. Moreover, we outline the techniques available to isolate and analyze the corona of LNPs, and we highlight their advantages and drawbacks. Finally, we discuss possible implications of the biomolecular corona for LNP delivery and we examine the potential of exploiting the corona as a targeting strategy beyond the liver to develop next-generation gene therapies."

The ligand on the NP surface recognizes its specific receptor expressed on the target tissue and the drug is released in a controlled manner. However, once injected in a physiological environment, NPs interact with biological components and are surrounded by a protein corona (PC). This can trigger an immune response and affect NP toxicity and targeting capabilities. In this review, we provide a survey of recent findings on the NP-PC interactions and discuss how the PC can be used to modulate both cytotoxicity and the immune response as well as to improve the efficacy of targeted delivery of nanocarriers."

This will help ground the reader in the topic.\n\n2. **Formation Mechanisms and Interactions**: This should detail the specific physical and chemical interactions that drive corona formation (e.g., hydrophobic interactions, electrostatic forces, etc.).\n\n3. **Structural Organization of the Corona**: Many quotes mention the distinction between \"hard\" and \"soft\" corona - this deserves its own dimension to explain how corona is structurally organized.\n\n4. **Factors Influencing Corona Formation**: Numerous quotes mention various factors that affect corona composition and formation, such as LNP properties (charge, composition, etc.) and environmental factors.\n\n5. **Protein and Biomolecule Composition**: Many quotes describe specific proteins and other biomolecules that form the corona, which is essential to understanding the mechanisms.\n\n6. **Temporal Dynamics of Corona Formation**: Several quotes mention the dynamic nature and evolution of the corona over time, which is an important mechanism aspect.\n\n7. **Functional Consequences**: While not directly about mechanisms, understanding how the corona affects LNP function helps explain why certain mechanisms are important.\n\nFor each dimension, I'll determine whether a synthesis or list format is most appropriate:\n\n- **Introduction/Background**: Synthesis - requires a coherent explanation of foundational concepts\n- **Formation Mechanisms and Interactions**: List - multiple distinct mechanisms are identified in the quotes\n- **Structural Organization of the Corona**: Synthesis - concepts of hard/soft corona need cohesive explanation\n- **Factors Influencing Corona Formation**: List - multiple distinct factors can be enumerated\n- **Protein and Biomolecule Composition**: List - various components can be itemized\n- **Temporal Dynamics of Corona Formation**: Synthesis - requires explanation of processes over time\n- **Functional Consequences**: Synthesis - requires connecting mechanisms to outcomes\n\nThis organization will provide a comprehensive overview of the key mechanisms while maintaining a logical flow that builds understanding from basic concepts to more complex dynamics.",

                            "Abstract The surfaces of pristine nanoparticles become rapidly coated by proteins in biological fluids, forming the so-called protein corona. The corona modifies key physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticle surfaces that modulate its biological and pharmacokinetic activity, biodistribution, and safety. In the two decades since the protein corona was identified, the importance of nanoparticles surface properties in regulating biological responses have been recognized. However, there is still a lack of clarity about the relationships between physiological conditions and corona composition over time, and how this controls biological activities/interactions. Here we review recent progress in characterizing the structure and composition of protein corona as a function of biological fluid and time. We summarize the influence of nanoparticle characteristics on protein corona composition and discuss the relevance of protein corona to the biological activity and fate of nanoparticles. The aim is to provide a critical summary of the key factors that affect protein corona formation (e.g. characteristics of nanoparticles and biological environment) and how the corona modulates biological activity, cellular uptake, biodistribution, and drug delivery. In addition to a discussion on the importance of the characterization of protein corona adsorbed on nanoparticle surfaces under conditions that mimic relevant physiological environment, we discuss the unresolved technical issues related to the characterization of nanoparticle-protein corona complexes during their journey in the body. Lastly, the paper offers a perspective on how the existing nanomaterial toxicity data obtained from in vitro studies should be reconsidered in the light of the presence of a protein corona, and how recent advances in fields, such as proteomics and machine learning can be integrated into the quantitative analysis of protein corona components."

These interactions result in the encapsulation of NPs by biomolecules, leading to the formation of a biomolecular corona, commonly known as the protein corona, due to its predominant enrichment with plasma proteins. Initially, it was observed that the presence of a protein corona on NPs hinders the effectiveness of targeting ligands, 23 thereby impairing the NP's targeting ability. However, it was later recognized that complete avoidance of protein corona formation, even in PEGylated systems, is not feasible. (Pozzi et al., 2014) Consequently, efforts were redirected toward harnessing the protein corona as an inherent targeting moiety, as the proteins acquired from the bloodstream could potentially serve as targeting ligands.

                            "Abstract The surfaces of pristine nanoparticles become rapidly coated by proteins in biological fluids, forming the so-called protein corona. The corona modifies key physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticle surfaces that modulate its biological and pharmacokinetic activity, biodistribution, and safety. In the two decades since the protein corona was identified, the importance of nanoparticles surface properties in regulating biological responses have been recognized. However, there is still a lack of clarity about the relationships between physiological conditions and corona composition over time, and how this controls biological activities/interactions. Here we review recent progress in characterizing the structure and composition of protein corona as a function of biological fluid and time. We summarize the influence of nanoparticle characteristics on protein corona composition and discuss the relevance of protein corona to the biological activity and fate of nanoparticles. The aim is to provide a critical summary of the key factors that affect protein corona formation (e.g. characteristics of nanoparticles and biological environment) and how the corona modulates biological activity, cellular uptake, biodistribution, and drug delivery. In addition to a discussion on the importance of the characterization of protein corona adsorbed on nanoparticle surfaces under conditions that mimic relevant physiological environment, we discuss the unresolved technical issues related to the characterization of nanoparticle-protein corona complexes during their journey in the body. Lastly, the paper offers a perspective on how the existing nanomaterial toxicity data obtained from in vitro studies should be reconsidered in the light of the presence of a protein corona, and how recent advances in fields, such as proteomics and machine learning can be integrated into the quantitative analysis of protein corona components."

The protein corona represents the new and dynamic NP interface with the external environment. Experimental studies investigating the nature and composition of the protein corona presented disparate outcomes, both because of the variety of NP and because of the different analytical methods used. A set of 125 plasma proteins has been found to associate with nanomaterials (Walkey et al., 2012), and among these albumin, immunoglobulins, apolipoprotein A-I, and complement components have been frequently found in the nanomaterial corona (Wolfram et al., 2014). If the proteins forming the corona undergo conformational changes with respect to their native structure, their functionality may be impaired, and their regular biological activity may be altered, causing abnormal interactions with other blood components [62]."

Biological fluids have complex compositions and the molecular components interact and function together in intricate networks. Therefore, the process to isolate blood or the preparation of blood derivatives may lead to differences in the composition of the identified protein corona around nanoparticles. Here, we show distinct differences in the protein corona formed in whole blood, whole blood with EDTA, plasma, or serum. Furthermore, the ratio between particle surface area to protein concentration influences the detected corona. We also show that the nanoparticle size per se influences the formed protein corona due to curvature effects. These results emphasize the need of investigating the formation and biological importance of the protein corona in the same environment as the nanoparticles are intended for or released into."

                            "Nanomaterials hold promise as multifunctional diagnostic and therapeutic agents. However, the effective application of nanomaterials is hampered by limited understanding and control over their interactions with complex biological systems. When a nanomaterial enters a physiological environment, it rapidly adsorbs proteins forming what is known as the protein 'corona'. The protein corona alters the size and interfacial composition of a nanomaterial, giving it a biological identity that is distinct from its synthetic identity. The biological identity determines the physiological response including signalling, kinetics, transport, accumulation, and toxicity. The structure and composition of the protein corona depends on the synthetic identity of the nanomaterial (size, shape, and composition), the nature of the physiological environment (blood, interstitial fluid, cell cytoplasm, etc.), and the duration of exposure. In this critical review, we discuss the formation of the protein corona, its structure and composition, and its influence on the physiological response. We also present an 'adsorbome' of 125 plasma proteins that are known to associate with nanomaterials. We further describe how the protein corona is related to the synthetic identity of a nanomaterial, and highlight efforts to control protein-nanomaterial interactions. We conclude by discussing gaps in the understanding of protein-nanomaterial interactions along with strategies to fill them (167 references)."

These interactions result in the encapsulation of NPs by biomolecules, leading to the formation of a biomolecular corona, commonly known as the protein corona, due to its predominant enrichment with plasma proteins. Initially, it was observed that the presence of a protein corona on NPs hinders the effectiveness of targeting ligands, 23 thereby impairing the NP's targeting ability. However, it was later recognized that complete avoidance of protein corona formation, even in PEGylated systems, is not feasible. (Pozzi et al., 2014) Consequently, efforts were redirected toward harnessing the protein corona as an inherent targeting moiety, as the proteins acquired from the bloodstream could potentially serve as targeting ligands.

                            "Structurally, proteins that are weakly bound to the NP surface form the \"soft corona,\" while proteins strongly bound to the NP surface form the \"hard corona.\" Functionally, the PC is characterized by the presence of opsonins (complement proteins), immunoglobulins, and lectins, which match to specific receptors on leukocyte membranes."

Proteins, which are the most important of these biomolecules, will adsorb -to some extent-on the NP surface, especially as PEG is removed, coating the surface with a new layer that will define the biological identity of the NP, the so-called \"biomolecular corona\", or \"protein corona\" (Walczyk et al., 2010)(Monopoli et al., 2012) which can dramatically alter the surface properties of nanosized particles and determine their in vivo fate (76)",

Some of these biomolecules might associate almost irreversibly with the iLNP surface, in either their native or denatured form, affecting, de facto, all subsequent interactions. It has been proposed that the corona is comprised of both these tightly bound proteins (\"hard\" corona), which presumably bind directly to the iLNP surface with high affinity, and also a looser, more dynamic layer (\"soft\" corona) which constantly exchanges with proteins in the environment (78). The hard and soft corona are both considered relevant in determining iLNP interactions with cells (73)."

Typically the bare surface of the particle is covered by several biomolecules, including a select group of proteins drawn from the biological medium. Here, we apply several different methodologies, in a time-resolved manner, to follow the lifetime of such biomolecular \"coronas\" both in situ and isolated from the excess plasma. We find that such particle-biomolecule complexes can be physically isolated from the surrounding medium and studied in some detail, without altering their structure. For several nanomaterial types, we find that blood plasma-derived coronas are sufficiently long-lived that they, rather than the nanomaterial surface, are likely to be what the cell sees. From fundamental science to regulatory safety, current efforts to classify the biological impacts of nanomaterials (currently according to bare material type and bare surface properties) may be assisted by the methodology and understanding reported here."

Under in vitro cell culture conditions, zeta potential measurements, UV-vis spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscope analysis were used to monitor the time evolution of the inorganic NP-protein corona formation and to characterize the stability of the NPs and their surface state at every stage of the experiment. As expected, the red-shift of the surface plasmon resonance peak, as well as the drop of surface charge and the increase of the hydrodynamic diameter indicated the conjugation of proteins to NPs. Remarkably, an evolution from a loosely attached toward an irreversible attached protein corona over time was observed. Mass spectrometry of the digested protein corona revealed albumin as the most abundant component which suggests an improved biocompatibility."

Eventually equilibrium is reached, at which point the continued exchange will not affect the composition of the corona. Results We developed a simple and effective dynamic model of the nanoparticle protein corona in a body fluid, namely human plasma. The model predicts the time evolution and equilibrium composition of the corona based on affinities, stoichiometries and rate constants. An application to the interaction of human serum albumin, high density lipoprotein (HDL) and fibrinogen with 70 nm N-iso-propylacrylamide/N-tert-butylacrylamide copolymer nanoparticles is presented, including novel experimental data for HDL. Conclusions The simple model presented here can easily be modified to mimic the interaction of the nanoparticle protein corona with a novel biological fluid or compartment once new data will be available, thus opening novel applications in nanotoxicity and nanomedicine."

This corona is, when sufficiently long-lived, thought to govern the particles' biological fate. However, even this long-lived \"hard\" corona evolves and re-equilibrates as particles pass from one biological fluid to another, and may be an important feature for long-term fate. Here we show the evolution of the protein corona as a result of transfer of nanoparticles from one biological fluid (plasma) into another (cytosolic fluid), a simple illustrative model for the uptake of nanoparticles into cells. While no direct comparison can be made to what would happen in, for example, the uptake pathway, the results confirm that significant evolution of the corona occurs in the second biological solution, but that the final corona contains a \"fingerprint\" of its history. This could be evolved to map the transport pathways utilized by nanoparticles, and eventually to predict nanoparticle fate and behavior."

                            "The formation and composition of protein corona is a complex process depending on the physicochemical properties of NPs (e.g., size, composition and charge) (Lundqvist et al., 2008)(Cedervall et al., 2007)(Dobrovolskaia et al., 2009)(Walkey et al., 2012)(Nel et al., 2009) and on the biological fluid (protein's abundance and affinity for NPs surface) (Monopoli et al., 2011)(Dobrovolskaia et al., 2009)(Lundqvist et al., 2011).The protein adsorption is also a dynamic and competitive process, where more abundant proteins might adsorb at first, even with weak bonds, being displaced thereafter by less abundant proteins with higher affinity for the NPs surface (Cedervall et al., 2007)(Casals et al., 2010)(Dell\u2019Orco et al., 2010).For example, experimental data (Cedervall et al., 2007) and the results of a simulation model (Dell\u2019Orco et al., 2010) suggest that human serum albumin (HSA) forms the early corona, and is soon replaced by higher-affinity and slower-exchanging apolipoproteins.The labile corona formed at initial time points is usually indicated as the \"soft corona\" and is characterized by a fast exchange rate with free proteins all around, whereas the latter is indicated as \"hard corona\" and is due to a more stable layer of proteins.Proteins adsorbed after incubation of NPs in plasma can be identified by proteomic analysis, and previous studies [5,8]36] indicated that the hard corona is mainly composed by 10-50 proteins including HSA, specific lipoproteins and proteins involved in coagulation and the complement pathway, with different consequences relevant to nanomedicine and nanosafety."

                            "Delivery and toxicity are critical issues facing nanomedicine research. Currently, there is limited understanding and connection between the physicochemical properties of a nanomaterial and its interactions with a physiological system. As a result, it remains unclear how to optimally synthesize and chemically modify nanomaterials for in vivo applications. It has been suggested that the physicochemical properties of a nanomaterial after synthesis, known as its \"synthetic identity\", are not what a cell encounters in vivo. Adsorption of blood components and interactions with phagocytes can modify the size, aggregation state, and interfacial composition of a nanomaterial, giving it a distinct \"biological identity\". Here, we investigate the role of size and surface chemistry in mediating serum protein adsorption to gold nanoparticles and their subsequent uptake by macrophages. Using label-free liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, we find that over 70 different serum proteins are heterogeneously adsorbed to the surface of gold nanoparticles. The relative density of each of these adsorbed proteins depends on nanoparticle size and poly(ethylene glycol) grafting density. Variations in serum protein adsorption correlate with differences in the mechanism and efficiency of nanoparticle uptake by a macrophage cell line. Macrophages contribute to the poor efficiency of nanomaterial delivery into diseased tissues, redistribution of nanomaterials within the body, and potential toxicity. This study establishes principles for the rational design of clinically useful nanomaterials."

Liposomes composed of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) or hydrogenated soybean phosphatidylcholine (HSPC) with 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1\u2032-rac-glycerol) (sodium salt) (DPPG), 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[methoxy(polyethylene glycol)-3000] (DPPE-PEG 3000), cholesterol (CH) or mixtures of these lipids, were prepared at different concentrations by the thin-film hydration method. After liposomes were dispersed in HPLC-grade water and foetal bovine serum (FBS), their physicochemical characteristics, such as size, size distribution, and \u03b6-potential, were determined using dynamic and electrophoretic light scattering. Aggregation of DPPC, HSPC, DPPC:CH (9:1 molar ratio), and HSPC:CH (9:1 molar ratio) in FBS was observed. On the contrary, liposomes incorporating DPPG lipids and CH both in a molar ratio of 11% were found to be stable over time, while their size did not alter dramatically in biological medium. Liposomes containing CH and PEGylated lipids retain their size in the presence of serum as well as their physical stability. In addition, our results indicate that the protein binding depends on the presence of polyethylene glycol (PEG), CH, concentration and surface charge. In this paper, we introduce a new parameter, fraction of stealthiness (Fs), for investigating the extent of protein binding to liposomes. This parameter depends on the changes in size of liposomes after serum incubation, while liposomes have stealth properties when Fs is close to 1. Thus, we conclude that lipid composition and concentration affect the adsorption of proteins and the liposomal stabilization."

                            "The protein corona phenomenon, mainly influenced by the surface properties of LNPs, has become popular among researchers in the field of nanosized drug delivery systems. After the administration of LNPs, serum proteins are adsorbed on the surface of the nanoparticles evidently, forming a protein corona. This corona may impede targeted efficacy by shielding surface ligands necessary for specific cell or receptor recognition. Surface-exposed PEGylated lipids play a crucial role in determining and regulating the composition of the corona proteins on LNPs. Parallelly, the compositions of the corona proteins can govern the distributions of the nanoparticles due to the organ-specific accumulations of the serum proteins, such as ApoE for the liver and complementary system-related proteins for the spleen.\n\nIn a recent study, Chen et al. [70] investigated the role of apolipoprotein-and vitronectin-enriched corona on LNPs for targeted delivery and transfection of oligonucleotides in murine tumor models. A slight change in the physicochemical properties of LNPs altered the corona pattern. For instance, the introduction of positive charge via cationic lipid 3\u03b2-{N-[2-(dimethylamino) ethyl]carbamoyl}cholesterol (DC-cholesterol) as a substitution for original cholesterol shifted the protein corona pattern from apolipoprotein-rich to vitronectin-rich."

It is now well acknowledged that upon systemic administration, biomolecules from blood will adsorb onto nanoparticles' surfaces, forming a \"protein corona\", affording nanoparticles a \"biological identity\" on top of their \"synthetic identity\". Detailed analysis of nanoparticle protein corona is gradually revealing the \"missing link\" between nanoparticle chemical properties and the biological identity. Nevertheless, the discovery of nanoparticle protein corona's impact on tumor delivery is limited. In this study, we demonstrate that protein corona can be manipulated by formulation composition and particle surface charge changes, and a single lipid switch could switch the nanoparticle protein corona profile. The protein corona composition differences had a profound impact on cell transfection, in vivo biodistribution as well as tumor-specific delivery efficiency. Nanoparticles with apolipoprotein-rich corona showed better delivery to hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) as compared to those with vitronectin-rich corona. In addition, we found that, the PEG conjugated lipid chain length and PEG amount in LNPs were key factors to consider in successful RNA interference therapy for solid tumors."

The presence of the protein corona may alter the properties of the nanoparticles, with profound influences for their tissue specificity. For instance, most LNPs exhibit hepatic specificity via intravenous administration, owing to the adsorption of ApoE by binding to the LDLR that are over-expressed on the hepatocytes (Dilliard et al., 2021). Additionally, it has been validated that the knockdown of ApoE lowered the liver targeting of nanomaterials by delivering mRNA into a mouse model lacking ApoE expression (Dilliard et al., 2021)",
                            "It is discovered that when the PEG-lipids desorb from LNPs, specific protein binding to LNPs is promoted. The desorption rate of PEG-lipids with longer hydrophobic chains is slower, which might not conducive to formulating appropriate protein coronas and achieving organ targeted delivery (Dilliard et al., 2021). In parallel, nano-vectors with different structures and properties may adsorb different proteins, resulting in protein coronas with distinct components and properties. The formation of protein corona at the interface will alter the physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles, exhibiting a crucial impact on their biodistribution and endocytosis (Eygeris et al., 2021). It has been demonstrated that LNPs with different pKa values can influence their organ targeting. More specifically, the preferred pK a range for liver, spleen, and lung targeting is 6.2~6.5, 2~6, and 7~9, respectively (Dilliard et al., 2021)(Jayaraman et al., 2012)(Xiong et al., 2020)."

                            "CRISPR\u2013Cas gene editing and messenger RNA-based protein replacement therapy hold tremendous potential to effectively treat disease-causing mutations with diverse cellular origin. However, it is currently impossible to rationally design nanoparticles that selectively target specific tissues. Here, we report a strategy termed selective organ targeting (SORT) wherein multiple classes of lipid nanoparticles are systematically engineered to exclusively edit extrahepatic tissues via addition of a supplemental SORT molecule. Lung-, spleen- and liver-targeted SORT lipid nanoparticles were designed to selectively edit therapeutically relevant cell types including epithelial cells, endothelial cells, B cells, T cells and hepatocytes. SORT is compatible with multiple gene editing techniques, including mRNA, Cas9 mRNA/single guide RNA and Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complexes, and is envisioned to aid the development of protein replacement and gene correction therapeutics in targeted tissues. The addition of selective organ targeting molecules to nanoparticles allows the specific targeting of extrahepatic tissues, enabling gene editing of distinct cell populations outside the liver."

                            "It is now clearly emerging that besides size and shape, the other primary defining element of nanoscale objects in biological media is their long-lived protein (\"hard\") corona. This corona may be expressed as a durable, stabilizing coating of the bare surface of nanoparticle (NP) monomers, or it may be reflected in different subpopulations of particle assemblies, each presenting a durable protein coating. Using the approach and concepts of physical chemistry, we relate studies on the composition of the protein corona at different plasma concentrations with structural data on the complexes both in situ and free from excess plasma. This enables a high degree of confidence in the meaning of the hard protein corona in a biological context. Here, we present the protein adsorption for two compositionally different NPs, namely sulfonated polystyrene and silica NPs. NP-protein complexes are characterized by differential centrifugal sedimentation, dynamic light scattering, and zeta-potential both in situ and once isolated from plasma as a function of the protein/NP surface area ratio. We then introduce a semiquantitative determination of their hard corona composition using one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrospray liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, which allows us to follow the total binding isotherms for the particles, identifying simultaneously the nature and amount of the most relevant proteins as a function of the plasma concentration. We find that the hard corona can evolve quite significantly as one passes from protein concentrations appropriate to in vitro cell studies to those present in in vivo studies, which has deep implications for in vitro-in vivo extrapolations and will require some consideration in the future."

                            "Significance Liver accumulation represents a significant barrier in the development of therapeutically efficacious nanoparticle drug delivery systems. Using a series of lipid nanoparticles with distinct organ-targeting properties, we provide evidence for a plausible mechanism of action for nanoparticle delivery to non-liver tissues. Following intravenous injection, specific proteins in the blood are recruited to the nanoparticle\u2019s surface based on its molecular composition and they endow it with a unique biological identity that governs its ultimate fate in the body. An innovative paradigm emerges from this mechanistic understanding of nanoparticle delivery\u2014endogenous targeting\u2014wherein the molecular composition of a nanoparticle is rationally engineered to interact with specific proteins in the blood to overcome liver accumulation and to target specific organs. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a clinically mature technology for the delivery of genetic medicines but have limited therapeutic applications due to liver accumulation. Recently, our laboratory developed selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles that expand the therapeutic applications of genetic medicines by enabling delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) and gene editing systems to non-liver tissues. SORT nanoparticles include a supplemental SORT molecule whose chemical structure determines the LNP\u2019s tissue-specific activity. To understand how SORT nanoparticles surpass the delivery barrier of liver hepatocyte accumulation, we studied the mechanistic factors which define their organ-targeting properties. We discovered that the chemical nature of the added SORT molecule controlled biodistribution, global/apparent pKa, and serum protein interactions of SORT nanoparticles. Additionally, we provide evidence for an endogenous targeting mechanism whereby organ targeting occurs via 1) desorption of poly(ethylene glycol) lipids from the LNP surface, 2) binding of distinct proteins to the nanoparticle surface because of recognition of exposed SORT molecules, and 3) subsequent interactions between surface-bound proteins and cognate receptors highly expressed in specific tissues. These findings establish a crucial link between the molecular composition of SORT nanoparticles and their unique and precise organ-targeting properties and suggest that the recruitment of specific proteins to a nanoparticle\u2019s surface can enable drug delivery beyond the liver."

The protein corona represents the new and dynamic NP interface with the external environment. Experimental studies investigating the nature and composition of the protein corona presented disparate outcomes, both because of the variety of NP and because of the different analytical methods used. A set of 125 plasma proteins has been found to associate with nanomaterials (Walkey et al., 2012), and among these albumin, immunoglobulins, apolipoprotein A-I, and complement components have been frequently found in the nanomaterial corona (Wolfram et al., 2014). If the proteins forming the corona undergo conformational changes with respect to their native structure, their functionality may be impaired, and their regular biological activity may be altered, causing abnormal interactions with other blood components [62]."

                            "Nanomaterials hold promise as multifunctional diagnostic and therapeutic agents. However, the effective application of nanomaterials is hampered by limited understanding and control over their interactions with complex biological systems. When a nanomaterial enters a physiological environment, it rapidly adsorbs proteins forming what is known as the protein 'corona'. The protein corona alters the size and interfacial composition of a nanomaterial, giving it a biological identity that is distinct from its synthetic identity. The biological identity determines the physiological response including signalling, kinetics, transport, accumulation, and toxicity. The structure and composition of the protein corona depends on the synthetic identity of the nanomaterial (size, shape, and composition), the nature of the physiological environment (blood, interstitial fluid, cell cytoplasm, etc.), and the duration of exposure. In this critical review, we discuss the formation of the protein corona, its structure and composition, and its influence on the physiological response. We also present an 'adsorbome' of 125 plasma proteins that are known to associate with nanomaterials. We further describe how the protein corona is related to the synthetic identity of a nanomaterial, and highlight efforts to control protein-nanomaterial interactions. We conclude by discussing gaps in the understanding of protein-nanomaterial interactions along with strategies to fill them (167 references)."

                            "Significance Liver accumulation represents a significant barrier in the development of therapeutically efficacious nanoparticle drug delivery systems. Using a series of lipid nanoparticles with distinct organ-targeting properties, we provide evidence for a plausible mechanism of action for nanoparticle delivery to non-liver tissues. Following intravenous injection, specific proteins in the blood are recruited to the nanoparticle\u2019s surface based on its molecular composition and they endow it with a unique biological identity that governs its ultimate fate in the body. An innovative paradigm emerges from this mechanistic understanding of nanoparticle delivery\u2014endogenous targeting\u2014wherein the molecular composition of a nanoparticle is rationally engineered to interact with specific proteins in the blood to overcome liver accumulation and to target specific organs. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a clinically mature technology for the delivery of genetic medicines but have limited therapeutic applications due to liver accumulation. Recently, our laboratory developed selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles that expand the therapeutic applications of genetic medicines by enabling delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) and gene editing systems to non-liver tissues. SORT nanoparticles include a supplemental SORT molecule whose chemical structure determines the LNP\u2019s tissue-specific activity. To understand how SORT nanoparticles surpass the delivery barrier of liver hepatocyte accumulation, we studied the mechanistic factors which define their organ-targeting properties. We discovered that the chemical nature of the added SORT molecule controlled biodistribution, global/apparent pKa, and serum protein interactions of SORT nanoparticles. Additionally, we provide evidence for an endogenous targeting mechanism whereby organ targeting occurs via 1) desorption of poly(ethylene glycol) lipids from the LNP surface, 2) binding of distinct proteins to the nanoparticle surface because of recognition of exposed SORT molecules, and 3) subsequent interactions between surface-bound proteins and cognate receptors highly expressed in specific tissues. These findings establish a crucial link between the molecular composition of SORT nanoparticles and their unique and precise organ-targeting properties and suggest that the recruitment of specific proteins to a nanoparticle\u2019s surface can enable drug delivery beyond the liver."

To explore this we analyze naturally efficacious biocorona compositions using an unbiased screening workflow. First, LNPs are complexed with plasma samples, from individual lean or obese male rats, and then functionally evaluated in vitro. Then, a fast, automated, and miniaturized method retrieves the LNPs with intact biocoronas, and multiomics analysis of the LNP-corona complexes reveals the particle corona content arising from each individual plasma sample. We find that the most efficacious LNP-corona complexes were enriched with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and, compared to the commonly used corona-biomarker Apolipoprotein E, corona HDL content was a superior predictor of in-vivo activity. Using technically challenging and clinically relevant lipid nanoparticles, these methods reveal a previously unreported role for HDL as a source of ApoE and, form a framework for improving LNP therapeutic efficacy by controlling corona composition."

                            "Background Nanoparticles in contact with biological fluids interact with proteins and other biomolecules, thus forming a dynamic corona whose composition varies over time due to continuous protein association and dissociation events. Eventually equilibrium is reached, at which point the continued exchange will not affect the composition of the corona. Results We developed a simple and effective dynamic model of the nanoparticle protein corona in a body fluid, namely human plasma. The model predicts the time evolution and equilibrium composition of the corona based on affinities, stoichiometries and rate constants. An application to the interaction of human serum albumin, high density lipoprotein (HDL) and fibrinogen with 70 nm N-iso-propylacrylamide/N-tert-butylacrylamide copolymer nanoparticles is presented, including novel experimental data for HDL. Conclusions The simple model presented here can easily be modified to mimic the interaction of the nanoparticle protein corona with a novel biological fluid or compartment once new data will be available, thus opening novel applications in nanotoxicity and nanomedicine."

                            "ABSTRACT The last decade has seen a sharp increase in the number of scientific publications describing physiological and pathological functions of extracellular vesicles (EVs), a collective term covering various subtypes of cell-released, membranous structures, called exosomes, microvesicles, microparticles, ectosomes, oncosomes, apoptotic bodies, and many other names. However, specific issues arise when working with these entities, whose size and amount often make them difficult to obtain as relatively pure preparations, and to characterize properly. The International Society for Extracellular Vesicles (ISEV) proposed Minimal Information for Studies of Extracellular Vesicles (\"MISEV\") guidelines for the field in 2014. We now update these \"MISEV2014\" guidelines based on evolution of the collective knowledge in the last four years. An important point to consider is that ascribing a specific function to EVs in general, or to subtypes of EVs, requires reporting of specific information beyond mere description of function in a crude, potentially contaminated, and heterogeneous preparation. For example, claims that exosomes are endowed with exquisite and specific activities remain difficult to support experimentally, given our still limited knowledge of their specific molecular machineries of biogenesis and release, as compared with other biophysically similar EVs. The MISEV2018 guidelines include tables and outlines of suggested protocols and steps to follow to document specific EV-associated functional activities. Finally, a checklist is provided with summaries of key points."

                            "Delivery and toxicity are critical issues facing nanomedicine research. Currently, there is limited understanding and connection between the physicochemical properties of a nanomaterial and its interactions with a physiological system. As a result, it remains unclear how to optimally synthesize and chemically modify nanomaterials for in vivo applications. It has been suggested that the physicochemical properties of a nanomaterial after synthesis, known as its \"synthetic identity\", are not what a cell encounters in vivo. Adsorption of blood components and interactions with phagocytes can modify the size, aggregation state, and interfacial composition of a nanomaterial, giving it a distinct \"biological identity\". Here, we investigate the role of size and surface chemistry in mediating serum protein adsorption to gold nanoparticles and their subsequent uptake by macrophages. Using label-free liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, we find that over 70 different serum proteins are heterogeneously adsorbed to the surface of gold nanoparticles. The relative density of each of these adsorbed proteins depends on nanoparticle size and poly(ethylene glycol) grafting density. Variations in serum protein adsorption correlate with differences in the mechanism and efficiency of nanoparticle uptake by a macrophage cell line. Macrophages contribute to the poor efficiency of nanomaterial delivery into diseased tissues, redistribution of nanomaterials within the body, and potential toxicity. This study establishes principles for the rational design of clinically useful nanomaterials."

                            "Nanomaterials hold promise as multifunctional diagnostic and therapeutic agents. However, the effective application of nanomaterials is hampered by limited understanding and control over their interactions with complex biological systems. When a nanomaterial enters a physiological environment, it rapidly adsorbs proteins forming what is known as the protein 'corona'. The protein corona alters the size and interfacial composition of a nanomaterial, giving it a biological identity that is distinct from its synthetic identity. The biological identity determines the physiological response including signalling, kinetics, transport, accumulation, and toxicity. The structure and composition of the protein corona depends on the synthetic identity of the nanomaterial (size, shape, and composition), the nature of the physiological environment (blood, interstitial fluid, cell cytoplasm, etc.), and the duration of exposure. In this critical review, we discuss the formation of the protein corona, its structure and composition, and its influence on the physiological response. We also present an 'adsorbome' of 125 plasma proteins that are known to associate with nanomaterials. We further describe how the protein corona is related to the synthetic identity of a nanomaterial, and highlight efforts to control protein-nanomaterial interactions. We conclude by discussing gaps in the understanding of protein-nanomaterial interactions along with strategies to fill them (167 references)."

Eventually equilibrium is reached, at which point the continued exchange will not affect the composition of the corona. Results We developed a simple and effective dynamic model of the nanoparticle protein corona in a body fluid, namely human plasma. The model predicts the time evolution and equilibrium composition of the corona based on affinities, stoichiometries and rate constants. An application to the interaction of human serum albumin, high density lipoprotein (HDL) and fibrinogen with 70 nm N-iso-propylacrylamide/N-tert-butylacrylamide copolymer nanoparticles is presented, including novel experimental data for HDL. Conclusions The simple model presented here can easily be modified to mimic the interaction of the nanoparticle protein corona with a novel biological fluid or compartment once new data will be available, thus opening novel applications in nanotoxicity and nanomedicine."

Under in vitro cell culture conditions, zeta potential measurements, UV-vis spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscope analysis were used to monitor the time evolution of the inorganic NP-protein corona formation and to characterize the stability of the NPs and their surface state at every stage of the experiment. As expected, the red-shift of the surface plasmon resonance peak, as well as the drop of surface charge and the increase of the hydrodynamic diameter indicated the conjugation of proteins to NPs. Remarkably, an evolution from a loosely attached toward an irreversible attached protein corona over time was observed. Mass spectrometry of the digested protein corona revealed albumin as the most abundant component which suggests an improved biocompatibility."

                            "The importance of the protein corona formed around nanoparticles upon entering a biological fluid has recently been highlighted. This corona is, when sufficiently long-lived, thought to govern the particles' biological fate. However, even this long-lived \"hard\" corona evolves and re-equilibrates as particles pass from one biological fluid to another, and may be an important feature for long-term fate. Here we show the evolution of the protein corona as a result of transfer of nanoparticles from one biological fluid (plasma) into another (cytosolic fluid), a simple illustrative model for the uptake of nanoparticles into cells. While no direct comparison can be made to what would happen in, for example, the uptake pathway, the results confirm that significant evolution of the corona occurs in the second biological solution, but that the final corona contains a \"fingerprint\" of its history. This could be evolved to map the transport pathways utilized by nanoparticles, and eventually to predict nanoparticle fate and behavior."

This corona may be expressed as a durable, stabilizing coating of the bare surface of nanoparticle (NP) monomers, or it may be reflected in different subpopulations of particle assemblies, each presenting a durable protein coating. Using the approach and concepts of physical chemistry, we relate studies on the composition of the protein corona at different plasma concentrations with structural data on the complexes both in situ and free from excess plasma. This enables a high degree of confidence in the meaning of the hard protein corona in a biological context. Here, we present the protein adsorption for two compositionally different NPs, namely sulfonated polystyrene and silica NPs. NP-protein complexes are characterized by differential centrifugal sedimentation, dynamic light scattering, and zeta-potential both in situ and once isolated from plasma as a function of the protein/NP surface area ratio. We then introduce a semiquantitative determination of their hard corona composition using one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrospray liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, which allows us to follow the total binding isotherms for the particles, identifying simultaneously the nature and amount of the most relevant proteins as a function of the plasma concentration. We find that the hard corona can evolve quite significantly as one passes from protein concentrations appropriate to in vitro cell studies to those present in in vivo studies, which has deep implications for in vitro-in vivo extrapolations and will require some consideration in the future."

                "tldr": "The formation of biomolecular coronas around LNPs fundamentally alters their biological identity, affecting their circulation time, biodistribution, cellular uptake, and therapeutic efficacy. While coronas can impede targeting by shielding surface ligands, they can also be harnessed for endogenous targeting through specific protein enrichment and can protect LNPs from degradation in blood. (15 sources)",
                "text": "\nThe biomolecular corona that forms around lipid nanoparticles upon contact with biological fluids has profound functional consequences for their behavior and efficacy in biological systems. When LNPs enter the bloodstream, the adsorption of proteins and other biomolecules creates a new biological interface that significantly alters their original properties and influences their subsequent interactions <Paper corpusId=\"269120128\" paperTitle=\"(Huang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"269341432\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nOne of the most significant impacts of corona formation is on the biodistribution and organ targeting of LNPs. The specific proteins adsorbed onto the LNP surface can determine which organs they preferentially accumulate in. For instance, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) enrichment in the corona promotes liver targeting through binding to low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLr) that are highly expressed on hepatocytes <Paper corpusId=\"275712592\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"259353478\" paperTitle=\"(Liu et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. Similarly, \u03b22-GPI enrichment facilitates lung targeting, while vitronectin (VTN) promotes spleen targeting <Paper corpusId=\"261091800\" paperTitle=\"(2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"245405261\" paperTitle=\"(Dilliard et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe protein corona can also significantly impact the cellular uptake mechanisms of LNPs. Receptor-mediated endocytosis is facilitated when specific proteins in the corona bind to their cognate receptors on cell surfaces <Paper corpusId=\"268238116\" paperTitle=\"(Berger et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. This interaction is crucial for the endogenous targeting mechanism, where the molecular composition of LNPs is engineered to recruit specific proteins that enable delivery beyond the liver <Paper corpusId=\"245405261\" paperTitle=\"(Dilliard et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nCorona formation has notable effects on the circulation time and clearance of LNPs. While the adsorption of opsonins like IgG, complement factors, and fibrinogen can promote phagocytosis and removal from the bloodstream, the binding of dysopsonins such as albumin and apolipoproteins can extend circulation time <Paper corpusId=\"3645568\" paperTitle=\"(Sanchez-Moreno et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>. Importantly, the protein coating on liposome carriers can protect nanoparticles from degradation in blood, reduce interactions with leukocytes, and prolong in vivo circulation time <Paper corpusId=\"254318207\" paperTitle=\"(Sartori et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe corona can also interfere with the targeting capabilities of functionalized LNPs. Surface ligands designed for specific cell or receptor recognition may be shielded by the adsorbed proteins, potentially impairing their targeting efficacy <Paper corpusId=\"269120128\" paperTitle=\"(Huang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"263607931\" paperTitle=\"(Amici et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"3328751\" paperTitle=\"(Pozzi et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>. However, this understanding has led to a paradigm shift where researchers now work to harness the protein corona as an inherent targeting moiety <Paper corpusId=\"263607931\" paperTitle=\"(Amici et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe immune response to LNPs is also significantly influenced by corona composition. The protein corona can contribute to particle opsonization and phagocytic clearance, lead to immune complex formation, generate immunogenic epitopes from self-antigens, and activate or suppress immune responses <Paper corpusId=\"73729405\" paperTitle=\"(La-Beck et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"5117550\" paperTitle=\"(Corbo et al._1, 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>. Additionally, proteins in the corona may undergo conformational changes when adsorbed to nanoparticle surfaces, potentially impairing their functionality and causing abnormal interactions with other blood components <Paper corpusId=\"216476213\" paperTitle=\"(Fedel, 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nFinally, even slight modifications in LNP composition can dramatically alter corona patterns and subsequent biological interactions. For example, substituting cholesterol with cationic DC-cholesterol can shift the protein corona from apolipoprotein-rich to vitronectin-rich, resulting in different biodistribution and tumor-specific delivery efficiencies <Paper corpusId=\"269120128\" paperTitle=\"(Huang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"203153060\" paperTitle=\"(Chen et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. This highlights the potential for rational design of LNPs to achieve specific targeting outcomes through intentional manipulation of corona composition.",

                            "The protein corona phenomenon, mainly influenced by the surface properties of LNPs, has become popular among researchers in the field of nanosized drug delivery systems. After the administration of LNPs, serum proteins are adsorbed on the surface of the nanoparticles evidently, forming a protein corona. This corona may impede targeted efficacy by shielding surface ligands necessary for specific cell or receptor recognition. Surface-exposed PEGylated lipids play a crucial role in determining and regulating the composition of the corona proteins on LNPs. Parallelly, the compositions of the corona proteins can govern the distributions of the nanoparticles due to the organ-specific accumulations of the serum proteins, such as ApoE for the liver and complementary system-related proteins for the spleen.\n\nIn a recent study, Chen et al. [70] investigated the role of apolipoprotein-and vitronectin-enriched corona on LNPs for targeted delivery and transfection of oligonucleotides in murine tumor models. A slight change in the physicochemical properties of LNPs altered the corona pattern. For instance, the introduction of positive charge via cationic lipid 3\u03b2-{N-[2-(dimethylamino) ethyl]carbamoyl}cholesterol (DC-cholesterol) as a substitution for original cholesterol shifted the protein corona pattern from apolipoprotein-rich to vitronectin-rich."

LNPs are cleared and extravasated from the circulation, and ultimately function intracellularly via cellular uptake and undergo organ, cellular, and molecular biological processes. 138 The composition of the protein corona is influenced by the chemical and molecular components of the surface of the LNPs, as well as its charge.\n\nRecent studies have shown that apolipoproteins can be incorporated into protein corona, exerting endogenous targeting properties and playing an important role in organ-and cell-specific targeting of LNPs. 140"

To explore this we analyze naturally efficacious biocorona compositions using an unbiased screening workflow. First, LNPs are complexed with plasma samples, from individual lean or obese male rats, and then functionally evaluated in vitro. Then, a fast, automated, and miniaturized method retrieves the LNPs with intact biocoronas, and multiomics analysis of the LNP-corona complexes reveals the particle corona content arising from each individual plasma sample. We find that the most efficacious LNP-corona complexes were enriched with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and, compared to the commonly used corona-biomarker Apolipoprotein E, corona HDL content was a superior predictor of in-vivo activity. Using technically challenging and clinically relevant lipid nanoparticles, these methods reveal a previously unreported role for HDL as a source of ApoE and, form a framework for improving LNP therapeutic efficacy by controlling corona composition."

                            "Upon intravenous injection, the nanoparticles come into contact with the serum, leading proteins to adsorb on their surface and form a distinctive protein corona layer (Dilliard et al., 2021). The presence of the protein corona may alter the properties of the nanoparticles, with profound influences for their tissue specificity. For instance, most LNPs exhibit hepatic specificity via intravenous administration, owing to the adsorption of ApoE by binding to the LDLR that are over-expressed on the hepatocytes (Dilliard et al., 2021). Additionally, it has been validated that the knockdown of ApoE lowered the liver targeting of nanomaterials by delivering mRNA into a mouse model lacking ApoE expression (Dilliard et al., 2021)",
                            "It is discovered that when the PEG-lipids desorb from LNPs, specific protein binding to LNPs is promoted. The desorption rate of PEG-lipids with longer hydrophobic chains is slower, which might not conducive to formulating appropriate protein coronas and achieving organ targeted delivery (Dilliard et al., 2021). In parallel, nano-vectors with different structures and properties may adsorb different proteins, resulting in protein coronas with distinct components and properties. The formation of protein corona at the interface will alter the physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles, exhibiting a crucial impact on their biodistribution and endocytosis (Eygeris et al., 2021). It has been demonstrated that LNPs with different pKa values can influence their organ targeting. More specifically, the preferred pK a range for liver, spleen, and lung targeting is 6.2~6.5, 2~6, and 7~9, respectively (Dilliard et al., 2021)(Jayaraman et al., 2012)(Xiong et al., 2020)."

                            "Significance Liver accumulation represents a significant barrier in the development of therapeutically efficacious nanoparticle drug delivery systems. Using a series of lipid nanoparticles with distinct organ-targeting properties, we provide evidence for a plausible mechanism of action for nanoparticle delivery to non-liver tissues. Following intravenous injection, specific proteins in the blood are recruited to the nanoparticle\u2019s surface based on its molecular composition and they endow it with a unique biological identity that governs its ultimate fate in the body. An innovative paradigm emerges from this mechanistic understanding of nanoparticle delivery\u2014endogenous targeting\u2014wherein the molecular composition of a nanoparticle is rationally engineered to interact with specific proteins in the blood to overcome liver accumulation and to target specific organs. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a clinically mature technology for the delivery of genetic medicines but have limited therapeutic applications due to liver accumulation. Recently, our laboratory developed selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles that expand the therapeutic applications of genetic medicines by enabling delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) and gene editing systems to non-liver tissues. SORT nanoparticles include a supplemental SORT molecule whose chemical structure determines the LNP\u2019s tissue-specific activity. To understand how SORT nanoparticles surpass the delivery barrier of liver hepatocyte accumulation, we studied the mechanistic factors which define their organ-targeting properties. We discovered that the chemical nature of the added SORT molecule controlled biodistribution, global/apparent pKa, and serum protein interactions of SORT nanoparticles. Additionally, we provide evidence for an endogenous targeting mechanism whereby organ targeting occurs via 1) desorption of poly(ethylene glycol) lipids from the LNP surface, 2) binding of distinct proteins to the nanoparticle surface because of recognition of exposed SORT molecules, and 3) subsequent interactions between surface-bound proteins and cognate receptors highly expressed in specific tissues. These findings establish a crucial link between the molecular composition of SORT nanoparticles and their unique and precise organ-targeting properties and suggest that the recruitment of specific proteins to a nanoparticle\u2019s surface can enable drug delivery beyond the liver."

Initially, it was observed that the presence of a protein corona on NPs hinders the effectiveness of targeting ligands, 23 thereby impairing the NP's targeting ability. However, it was later recognized that complete avoidance of protein corona formation, even in PEGylated systems, is not feasible.

Unfortunately, opsonins are also adsorbed. These proteins are immediately recognized by the phagocyte system with rapid clearance of the NPs from the bloodstream. Polyethyleneglycol (PEG) coating of NPs (PEGylation) is the most efficient anti-opsonization strategy. Linear chains of PEG, grafted onto the NP surface, are able to create steric hindrance, resulting in a significant inhibition of protein adsorption and less recognition by macrophages. However, excessive PEGylation can lead to a strong inhibition of cellular uptake and less efficient binding with protein targets, reducing the potential of the delivery system. To reach a compromise in this regard we employed a multi-component (MC) lipid system with uncommon properties of cell uptake and endosomal escape and increasing length of PEG chains. Nano liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS/MS) analysis allowed us to accurately determine the corona composition showing that apolipoproteins are the most abundant class in the corona and that increasing the PEG length reduced the protein adsorption and the liposomal surface affinity for apolipoproteins. Due to the abundance of apolipoproteins, we exploited the \"protein corona effect\" to deliver cationic liposome-human plasma complexes to human prostate cancer PC3 cells that express a high level of scavenger receptor class B type 1 in order to evaluate the cellular uptake efficiency of the systems used. Combining laser scanning confocal microscopy with flow cytometry analysis in PC3 cells we demonstrated that MC-PEG2k is the best compromise between an anti-opsonization strategy and active targeting and could be a promising candidate to treat prostate cancer in vivo."

The mechanisms of protein adsorption and the impact of the protein corona composition on interactions with the innate immune system have been reviewed in depth (Caracciolo, 2015)(Barbero et al., 2017). The protein corona contributes to particle opsonization and phagocytic clearance, and may also lead to formation of immune complexes, immunogenic epitope generation from self-antigens, and activation or suppression of immune responses (Caracciolo, 2015)(Corbo et al., 2016)(Barbero et al., 2017). Moreover, the protein corona can interfere with targeting functions of liposomes surface-conjugated to active targeting molecules such as antibodies (Nellis et al., 2008)(Suzuki et al., 2008). Recent work in understanding the protein corona has shown that its composition is dynamic and highly variable, depending on the physicochemical characteristics of the nanoparticle as well as fluctuations in host circulating proteins."

The ligand on the NP surface recognizes its specific receptor expressed on the target tissue and the drug is released in a controlled manner. However, once injected in a physiological environment, NPs interact with biological components and are surrounded by a protein corona (PC). This can trigger an immune response and affect NP toxicity and targeting capabilities. In this review, we provide a survey of recent findings on the NP-PC interactions and discuss how the PC can be used to modulate both cytotoxicity and the immune response as well as to improve the efficacy of targeted delivery of nanocarriers."

The protein corona represents the new and dynamic NP interface with the external environment. Experimental studies investigating the nature and composition of the protein corona presented disparate outcomes, both because of the variety of NP and because of the different analytical methods used. A set of 125 plasma proteins has been found to associate with nanomaterials (Walkey et al., 2012), and among these albumin, immunoglobulins, apolipoprotein A-I, and complement components have been frequently found in the nanomaterial corona (Wolfram et al., 2014). If the proteins forming the corona undergo conformational changes with respect to their native structure, their functionality may be impaired, and their regular biological activity may be altered, causing abnormal interactions with other blood components [62]."

It is now well acknowledged that upon systemic administration, biomolecules from blood will adsorb onto nanoparticles' surfaces, forming a \"protein corona\", affording nanoparticles a \"biological identity\" on top of their \"synthetic identity\". Detailed analysis of nanoparticle protein corona is gradually revealing the \"missing link\" between nanoparticle chemical properties and the biological identity. Nevertheless, the discovery of nanoparticle protein corona's impact on tumor delivery is limited. In this study, we demonstrate that protein corona can be manipulated by formulation composition and particle surface charge changes, and a single lipid switch could switch the nanoparticle protein corona profile. The protein corona composition differences had a profound impact on cell transfection, in vivo biodistribution as well as tumor-specific delivery efficiency. Nanoparticles with apolipoprotein-rich corona showed better delivery to hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) as compared to those with vitronectin-rich corona. In addition, we found that, the PEG conjugated lipid chain length and PEG amount in LNPs were key factors to consider in successful RNA interference therapy for solid tumors."
