Theranostic nanoplatforms simultaneously bearing diagnostic and therapeutic functions through a single entity are crucial for detecting diseases at an early stage and realizing image-guided therapies, which is favored to improve the survival rate of cancer patients [1,2]. Recently, phototheranostic nanoagents utilizing light to collect diagnostic information and achieve therapeutic effects have gained intensive attention due to their noninvasiveness, high efficiency, and convenient maneuverability in a spatial and temporal manner [3,4]. Among the numerous phototheranostic strategies, photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and photothermal therapy (PTT) can seamlessly and synergistically match each other, because the efficacies of both PAI and PTT are mainly dependent on photothermal conversion ability, considering that PAI uses photothermally converted acoustic waves to realize ultrasound signal detection [5][6][7][8]. PAI can overcome the traditional optical penetration limitations (e.g., fluorescence imaging) since it detects phonons rather than photons under light excitation, providing superior spatial resolution, high contrast, and deep tissue penetration [7,[9][10][11]. To date, various optical agents have been developed for PAI/PTT theranostics, including small molecule dyes, metallic nanoparticles, and carbon nanomaterials [12][13][14][15][16]. Nevertheless, small molecule dyes usually suffer from photobleaching, while metallic nanoparticles encounter severe biotoxicity and carbon nanomaterials have broad PAI spectra without a specific wavelength and a low extinction coefficient for PAI and PTT [17,18]. Semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) characterized by \u03c0-\u03c0 electron delocalized backbones and easy exciton diffusion along the backbone represent a new PAI/PTT agent with good photostability, high extinction coefficient, and excellent photothermal conversion efficiency [1,5].",

As SPNs are fabricated from biologically inert organic compounds, they can inherently avoid of heavy metal ion-induced toxicity to tissues and thus possess good biocompatibility [19]. However, narrowing their absorption bandgap within the near-infrared light (NIR) window along with a high extinction coefficient is challenging but essentially needed, which may facilitate efficient NIR photothermal conversion for PAI and PTT [20]. In addition, similar to other nano-scaled biomaterials, artificial phototheranostic nanoagents generally encounter several obstacles in clinical translation, including easy recognition by the immune system, insufficient accumulation in the tumor site, and safety concerns regarding physiological interactions and metabolism, which compromise their potential for clinical practice [21,22].",

                    "text": "In summary, we have prepared a novel phototheranostic platform based on D-A semiconducting polymer nanoparticle (SPN) with surface camouflaged by red blood cell membrane (RBCM) for NIR photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and photothermal therapy (PTT). The as-prepared SPN@ RBCM nanoparticles display excellent NIR absorbance, high photothermal conversion ability, and good photothermal stability. Moreover, inherited from the natural features of the sourced red blood cells, the SPN@RBCM nanoparticles possess excellent performance of the enhanced biocompatibility, reduced retention in the reticuloendothelial system, prolonged blood circulation, and the improved tumor accumulation. On the other hand, the SPN@RBCM has small size (< 5 nm), which not only shows deep penetration in tumor site, but also can be easily cleared out from the body to overcome the long-term toxicity induced by the undefined residues after systemic administration. Therefore, as-prepared SPN@RBCM could act as an optimal phototheranostic nanoagent to provide intensified PA signals for tumor imaging and enhanced photothermal killing effects for cancer treatment. Given these outstanding characteristics, this nanoplatform might be a promising phototheranostic agent for clinical translation in future.

The D-A backbone structure endowed SPN@ RBCM with excellent NIR absorption and photothermal conversion ability, which showed excellent PAI and PTT efficacy both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, owing to its ultrasmall size, SPN@RBCM had significantly deep tumor penetration and could be cleared from the body without toxicity. Compared with previously reported semiconducting polymer nanoparticles, the most distinctive feature of our SPN@RBCM is the combination of a small-sized structure and RBCM camouflage, which reconciles the dilemma between prolonged blood circulation for tumor accumulation and rapid clearance from the body to reduce long-term toxicity. Thus, this work presents a promising phototheranostic agent for clinical translation.",

The resulting RBCM-coated SPN (SPN@RBCM) displays remarkable near-infrared light absorption and good photostability, as well as high photothermal conversion efficiency for photoacoustic imaging and photothermal therapy. Particularly, due to the small size (<\u20095 nm), SPN@RBCM has the advantages of deep tumor penetration and rapid clearance from the body with no appreciable toxicity. The RBCM endows the SPNs with prolonged systematic circulation time, less reticuloendothelial system uptake and reduced immune-recognition, hence improving tumor accumulation after intravenous injection, which provides strong photoacoustic signals and exerts excellent photothermal therapeutic effects. Thus, this work provides a valuable paradigm for safe and highly efficient tumor photoacoustic imaging and photothermal therapy for further clinical translation.\n## body\n\u2022 The RBCM endows SPN with good biocompatibility, prolonged blood circulation, and improved tumor accumulation, while the small size structure endows SPN with deep tumor penetration and rapid clearance from body. Theranostic nanoplatforms simultaneously bearing diagnostic and therapeutic functions through a single entity are crucial for detecting diseases at an early stage and realizing image-guided therapies, which is favored to improve the survival rate of cancer patients [1,2]. Recently, phototheranostic nanoagents utilizing light to collect diagnostic information and achieve therapeutic effects have gained intensive attention due to their noninvasiveness, high efficiency, and convenient maneuverability in a spatial and temporal manner [3,4]. Among the numerous phototheranostic strategies, photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and photothermal therapy (PTT) can seamlessly and synergistically match each other, because the efficacies of both PAI and PTT are mainly dependent on photothermal conversion ability, considering that PAI uses photothermally converted acoustic waves to realize ultrasound signal detection [5][6][7][8]. PAI can overcome the traditional optical penetration limitations (e.g., fluorescence imaging) since it detects phonons rather than photons under light excitation, providing superior spatial resolution, high contrast, and deep tissue penetration [7,[9][10][11]. To date, various optical agents have been developed for PAI/PTT theranostics, including small molecule dyes, metallic nanoparticles, and carbon nanomaterials [12][13][14][15][16]. Nevertheless, small molecule dyes usually suffer from photobleaching, while metallic nanoparticles encounter severe biotoxicity and carbon nanomaterials have broad PAI spectra without a specific wavelength and a low extinction coefficient for PAI and PTT [17,18]. Semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) characterized by \u03c0-\u03c0 electron delocalized backbones and easy exciton diffusion along the backbone represent a new PAI/PTT agent with good photostability, high extinction coefficient, and excellent photothermal conversion efficiency [1,5].\n...\nSemiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) characterized by \u03c0-\u03c0 electron delocalized backbones and easy exciton diffusion along the backbone represent a new PAI/PTT agent with good photostability, high extinction coefficient, and excellent photothermal conversion efficiency [1,5]. As SPNs are fabricated from biologically inert organic compounds, they can inherently avoid of heavy metal ion-induced toxicity to tissues and thus possess good biocompatibility [19]. However, narrowing their absorption bandgap within the near-infrared light (NIR) window along with a high extinction coefficient is challenging but essentially needed, which may facilitate efficient NIR photothermal conversion for PAI and PTT [20]. In addition, similar to other nano-scaled biomaterials, artificial phototheranostic nanoagents generally encounter several obstacles in clinical translation, including easy recognition by the immune system, insufficient accumulation in the tumor site, and safety concerns regarding physiological interactions and metabolism, which compromise their potential for clinical practice [21,22].\n\n## ABSTRACT\nThese SPNs were further camouflaged with RBCM, namely SPN@RBCM, to reduce the rapid clearance by phagocytic cells and prolong the circulation lifetime. The D-A backbone structure endowed SPN@ RBCM with excellent NIR absorption and photothermal conversion ability, which showed excellent PAI and PTT efficacy both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, owing to its ultrasmall size, SPN@RBCM had significantly deep tumor penetration and could be cleared from the body without toxicity. Compared with previously reported semiconducting polymer nanoparticles, the most distinctive feature of our SPN@RBCM is the combination of a small-sized structure and RBCM camouflage, which reconciles the dilemma between prolonged blood circulation for tumor accumulation and rapid clearance from the body to reduce long-term toxicity. Thus, this work presents a promising phototheranostic agent for clinical translation.\n\n## Conclusions\nIn summary, we have prepared a novel phototheranostic platform based on D-A semiconducting polymer nanoparticle (SPN) with surface camouflaged by red blood cell membrane (RBCM) for NIR photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and photothermal therapy (PTT). The as-prepared SPN@ RBCM nanoparticles display excellent NIR absorbance, high photothermal conversion ability, and good photothermal stability. Moreover, inherited from the natural features of the sourced red blood cells, the SPN@RBCM nanoparticles possess excellent performance of the enhanced biocompatibility, reduced retention in the reticuloendothelial system, prolonged blood circulation, and the improved tumor accumulation. On the other hand, the SPN@RBCM has small size (< 5 nm), which not only shows deep penetration in tumor site, but also can be easily cleared out from the body to overcome the long-term toxicity induced by the undefined residues after systemic administration. Therefore, as-prepared SPN@RBCM could act as an optimal phototheranostic nanoagent to provide intensified PA signals for tumor imaging and enhanced photothermal killing effects for cancer treatment. Given these outstanding characteristics, this nanoplatform might be a promising phototheranostic agent for clinical translation in future.

Gargiulo, S. Albanese, M. Mancini\n## Abstract\nThe optical imaging plays an increasing role in preclinical studies, particularly in cancer biology. The combined ultrasound and optical imaging, named photoacoustic imaging (PAI), is an emerging hybrid technique for real-time molecular imaging in preclinical research and recently expanding into clinical setting. PAI can be performed using endogenous contrast, particularly from oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin and melanin, or exogenous contrast agents, sometimes targeted for specific biomarkers, providing comprehensive morphofunctional and molecular information on tumor microenvironment. Overall, PAI has revealed notable opportunities to improve knowledge on tumor pathophysiology and on the biological mechanisms underlying therapy. The aim of this review is to introduce the principles of PAI and to provide a brief overview of current PAI applications in preclinical research, highlighting also on recent advances in clinical translation for cancer diagnosis, staging, and therapy.\n## Semiconducting Polymer Nanoparticles.\nRecent advances have been made for cancer PAI and PTT using semiconducting polymer (SP) NPs, an emerging group of contrast agents characterized by optical features, biocompatibility, photostability, and functionalization potentially more advantageous for in vivo applications compared to the most widely used organic dyes, metallic NPs, and carbon nanomaterials [86]. e remarkable optical features of SPNPs are mainly related to the presence of delocalized electrons, while PA signal enhancement has been achieved by modifying their polymeric structure and designing activatable molecular probes [87].\n\nInitial investigations on the use of SPNPs for in vivo PAI were conducted by Pu and colleagues [88] that highlighted the advantages over SWNTs or GNRs, based on a wider and more stable PA signal, and higher detection sensibility. In a following study, the same author and coworkers [89] highlighted the feasibility of diketopyrrolopyrrole-(DPP-) based SPNs for in vivo PAI on a HeLa xenograft mouse model. After IV administration, DPP-SPNs exhibited a significantly higher PA signal in tumor than surrounding tissues, presumably due to extravasation of SPNs through cancer blood vessels. ese studies provided the first insights about the potential of SPNs for high-resolution PAI in oncological research.\n\nFurther improvements in biodistribution of amphiphilic polymers containing DPP-SPNs have been obtained through PEGylation [90], overcoming also the potential issue of their dissociation. In a proof of concept study, the ability of these amphiphilic SPNs for in vivo tumor imaging was demonstrated at 24 hours after IV injection.\n\nAttempts for advances in diagnostic specificity and sensitivity are also in progress through implementation of multispectral PAI. Zhang and colleagues [91] developed semiconducting polymer dots (Pdots), which include in their structure isoindigo (IID) and 4,7-dithien-2-yl-2,1,3benzothiadiazole (DTBT) as electron acceptors. is chemical modification, consisting in incorporation of an electron-deficient element into the SPNs structure, is known as the \"self-quenched process,",

            "abstract": "The last decade has witnessed the growing development of optical imaging using near-infrared (NIR) light (wavelength range: 700\u20131700 nm) in a wide range of applications, from fundamental research of live biological and physiological processes to clinical applications such as disease screening and image-guide surgical interventions. The low-energy NIR light offers reduced tissue scattering, absorption as well as autofluorescence background compared to traditional wavelengths in the visible (400\u2013700 nm) range, thus dramatically enhancing imaging resolution, signal-to-noise ratio, and penetration depth. This Research Topic calls for advances in new fluorescent probes, imaging instrumentation, analytical methods and their applications for improvement of diagnosis and therapy in this \u201ctissue transparent window,\u201d aiming to provide a timely update of this continuously evolving filed. Imaging and diagnosis agents are the cornerstone of preclinical applications. In their study, Tan et al. report lycosin-I peptide modified gold nanoclusters (LGNCs), which exhibit strong NIR fluorescence, for imaging of specific cancer cell nuclei. The lycosin-I peptide not only possesses highly efficient and selective intracellular translocation against several cancer cells, but also induces aggregation of gold nanoclusters to further enhance their brightness. After uptake by tumor cells, the LGNCs aggregates can be depolymerized into ultrasmall nanoclusters by the high level GSH in the tumor microenvironment, facilitating nuclear targeting translocation in cancer cells. Another study by Huang et al. reports a novel biomimetic nanoprobe for photoacoustic (PA) imaging of cervical carcinoma. This probe is constructed by coating indocyanine green (ICG)-loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles with the cancer cell membrane, providing small particle size, excellent dispersion, large loading efficiency, good biocompatibility and homologous targeting ability to Hela cells in vitro. The biomimetic nanoprobe can specifically accumulate into tumor and display a superior PA imaging efficacy compared with free ICG, allowing for non-invasive deep tissue imaging of cervical carcinoma in vivo. Another article by Gu et al. focuses on a particular type of NIR fluorophores, semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs). SPNs are constructed by encapsulating hydrophobic semiconducting polymers (SPs) with amphiphilic copolymers, and have shown great promise for phototheranostics of cancer. The authors review recent advances of thiadiazoloquinoxaline (TQ)-based SPNs from their synthesis and hydrophilic functionalization to NIR-II (1,000\u20131,700 nm) fluorescence imagingguided cancer photothermal therapy (PTT). To enhance the PTT efficiency, they also discuss methods for constructing SPNs with capability of multimodal imaging. Current limitations are summarized at the end that hamper clinical applications of the SPNs, such as relatively large size and low tumor targeting ability.

The low-energy NIR light offers reduced tissue scattering, absorption as well as autofluorescence background compared to traditional wavelengths in the visible (400\u2013700 nm) range, thus dramatically enhancing imaging resolution, signal-to-noise ratio, and penetration depth. This Research Topic calls for advances in new fluorescent probes, imaging instrumentation, analytical methods and their applications for improvement of diagnosis and therapy in this \u201ctissue transparent window,\u201d aiming to provide a timely update of this continuously evolving filed. Imaging and diagnosis agents are the cornerstone of preclinical applications. In their study, Tan et al. report lycosin-I peptide modified gold nanoclusters (LGNCs), which exhibit strong NIR fluorescence, for imaging of specific cancer cell nuclei. The lycosin-I peptide not only possesses highly efficient and selective intracellular translocation against several cancer cells, but also induces aggregation of gold nanoclusters to further enhance their brightness. After uptake by tumor cells, the LGNCs aggregates can be depolymerized into ultrasmall nanoclusters by the high level GSH in the tumor microenvironment, facilitating nuclear targeting translocation in cancer cells. Another study by Huang et al. reports a novel biomimetic nanoprobe for photoacoustic (PA) imaging of cervical carcinoma. This probe is constructed by coating indocyanine green (ICG)-loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles with the cancer cell membrane, providing small particle size, excellent dispersion, large loading efficiency, good biocompatibility and homologous targeting ability to Hela cells in vitro. The biomimetic nanoprobe can specifically accumulate into tumor and display a superior PA imaging efficacy compared with free ICG, allowing for non-invasive deep tissue imaging of cervical carcinoma in vivo. Another article by Gu et al. focuses on a particular type of NIR fluorophores, semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs). SPNs are constructed by encapsulating hydrophobic semiconducting polymers (SPs) with amphiphilic copolymers, and have shown great promise for phototheranostics of cancer. The authors review recent advances of thiadiazoloquinoxaline (TQ)-based SPNs from their synthesis and hydrophilic functionalization to NIR-II (1,000\u20131,700 nm) fluorescence imagingguided cancer photothermal therapy (PTT).

Unfortunately, traditional phototherapy lacks a facile imaging method to monitor the therapeutic process and efficiency in real time, usually leading to severe side effects due to high levels of ROS and hyperthermia. To realize precise cancer treatment methods, it is highly desired to develop phototherapeutic agents possessing an imaging ability to evaluate the therapeutic process and efficacy in real time during cancer phototherapy. Recently, a series of self-reporting phototherapeutic agents were reported to monitor PDT and PTT processes by combining optical imaging technologies with phototherapy. Due to the real-time feedback provided by optical imaging technology, therapeutic responses or dynamic changes in the tumor microenvironment could be evaluated in a timely manner, thereby achieving personalized precision treatment and minimizing toxic side effects. In this review, we focus on the advances in the development of self-reporting phototherapeutic agents for a cancer phototherapy evaluation based on optical imaging technology to realize precision cancer treatments.

In SPN CT , PPV acted as the temperature-reporting probe to produce temperature-related persistent luminescence based on the thermodynamically controllable decomposition of dioxetane units in PPV. Meanwhile, PCSD within SPN CT absorbed the NIR light to generate heat for PTT (Figure 16a). Once intravenously injected, the distribution and accumulation of SPN CT in tumors were visualized via persistent luminescence imaging (Figure 16b). Under the irradiation of an NIR laser, PCSD produced heat to increase the temperature in tumors. Subsequently, the persistent luminescence of SPN CT was enhanced to report the photothermal temperature of the PTT process (Figure 16b). The SPN CT presented in this work achieved real-time temperature-monitoring PTT without the interference of tissue autofluorescence because real-time light excitation was not involved.

In 2019, through reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization of polystyrene-b-poly (Nisopropylacrylamide-co-acrylic acid) (PSNiAA), Xu's team prepared a functional nanoparticles (PDPP3T@PSNiAA) with photothermal sensitivity and PA response [52]. Anti-cancer drug Doxorubicin (Dox) was also loaded onto these NPs by electrostatic interaction and formed PDPP3T@PSNiAA-Dox NPs. The data showed that all PDPP3T@PSNiAA-Dox NPs at different concentrations had a time-dependent increasing laser irradiation response. The temperature of the NPs could still increase to the same level even up to the fourth laser-cooling circle, indicating the photothermal stability of PDPP3T@PSNiAA-Dox NPs. Additionally, experiments for the PA properties of these NPs conducted in vitro showed that the maximum intensity of PDPP3T@PSNiAA NPs was at 785 nm, and the higher concentration of NPs contributed to higher PA signals. The in vivo experiments indicated that these PDPP3T@PSNiAA-Dox NPs could accumulate in tumor region over time (Figure 7). A burst intracellular Dox release occurred with NIR irradiation at acidic condition (80%), while it was below 40% at neutral condition, which could minimize the release of the drug in normal tissues. In vivo studies on HeLa tumor-bearing mice showed that tumors of PDPP3T@PSNiAA-Dox NPs with laser treatment were effectively eliminated without reoccurrence, while groups treated with free Dox (with and without laser) and NPs without laser showed none or minor tumor elimination.",

                    "text": " variety of new, non-fluorescent PA contrast agents are being developed, such as single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) and gold nanoparticles (AuNP). 2,5 However, many of these have only moderate molar extinction coefficients, as well as poor photostability, a tendency to aggregate and poor toxicity/biodegradability. Alongside their applications in molecular electronics and photovoltaics, semiconducting polymers (SP) have in the last decade attracted attention for use in PAI. 6-9 Their extensive, highly delocalised \u03c0-conjugated backbones give SP a narrow band gap, facilitating photoexcitation and energy transfer and conferring excellent opto-electronic properties. Their organic composition also carries less potential for toxic degradation than their inorganic counterparts. The inherent hydrophobicity of SP allows them to be formulated into nanoparticles alongside oligomers and lipids, to form semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPN). These have large absorption coefficients, controllable sizes, adjustable absorption maxima, optical properties that are independent of particle size, and high photostability. The majority of reported SPN have been formed through the co-precipitation of lipids and SP, via either nano-precipitation 10 or mini-emulsion. 11 These techniques effectively encapsulate a waterinsoluble, conjugated polymer within a water-soluble, liposome-like construct. Amphiphilic SP can also undergo crystallisation-driven selfassembly in solution to form nanoparticles with a core-shell architecture, 12 and more recently microfluidic processing systems have been shown to enable large scale, high throughput production of uniform SPN. 13,14 Over the last decade, different SPN have been developed with a range of SP, liposomal formulations and PEGylation approaches, leading to nanoparticles with long in vivo lifetimes, good biodistribution profiles and maximum absorbance tuned to the NIR-I or NIR-II regions.",

Tabor\n## Abstract\nNone\n## Introduction\n variety of new, non-fluorescent PA contrast agents are being developed, such as single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) and gold nanoparticles (AuNP). 2,5 However, many of these have only moderate molar extinction coefficients, as well as poor photostability, a tendency to aggregate and poor toxicity/biodegradability. Alongside their applications in molecular electronics and photovoltaics, semiconducting polymers (SP) have in the last decade attracted attention for use in PAI. 6-9 Their extensive, highly delocalised \u03c0-conjugated backbones give SP a narrow band gap, facilitating photoexcitation and energy transfer and conferring excellent opto-electronic properties. Their organic composition also carries less potential for toxic degradation than their inorganic counterparts. The inherent hydrophobicity of SP allows them to be formulated into nanoparticles alongside oligomers and lipids, to form semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPN). These have large absorption coefficients, controllable sizes, adjustable absorption maxima, optical properties that are independent of particle size, and high photostability. The majority of reported SPN have been formed through the co-precipitation of lipids and SP, via either nano-precipitation 10 or mini-emulsion. 11 These techniques effectively encapsulate a waterinsoluble, conjugated polymer within a water-soluble, liposome-like construct. Amphiphilic SP can also undergo crystallisation-driven selfassembly in solution to form nanoparticles with a core-shell architecture, 12 and more recently microfluidic processing systems have been shown to enable large scale, high throughput production of uniform SPN. 13,14 Over the last decade, different SPN have been developed with a range of SP, liposomal formulations and PEGylation approaches, leading to nanoparticles with long in vivo lifetimes, good biodistribution profiles and maximum absorbance tuned to the NIR-I or NIR-II regions.",

            "abstract": "Abstract. Significance: Deep tissue noninvasive high-resolution imaging with light is challenging due to the high degree of light absorption and scattering in biological tissue. Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) can overcome some of the challenges of pure optical or ultrasound imaging to provide high-resolution deep tissue imaging. However, label-free PAI signals from light absorbing chromophores within the tissue are nonspecific. The use of exogeneous contrast agents (probes) not only enhances the imaging contrast (and imaging depth) but also increases the specificity of PAI by binding only to targeted molecules and often providing signals distinct from the background. Aim: We aim to review the current development and future progression of photoacoustic molecular probes/contrast agents. Approach: First, PAI and the need for using contrast agents are briefly introduced. Then, the recent development of contrast agents in terms of materials used to construct them is discussed. Then, various probes are discussed based on targeting mechanisms, in vivo molecular imaging applications, multimodal uses, and use in theranostic applications. Results: Material combinations are being used to develop highly specific contrast agents. In addition to passive accumulation, probes utilizing activation mechanisms show promise for greater controllability. Several probes also enable concurrent multimodal use with fluorescence, ultrasound, Raman, magnetic resonance imaging, and computed tomography. Finally, targeted probes are also shown to aid localized and molecularly specific photo-induced therapy. Conclusions: The development of contrast agents provides a promising prospect for increased contrast, higher imaging depth, and molecularly specific information. Of note are agents that allow for controlled activation, explore other optical windows, and enable multimodal use to overcome some of the shortcomings of label-free PAI.",

The advantages of SPNs are numerous and include large absorption coefficient, tunable absorption, high photostability, low toxicity, 86 high structural flexibility, small size, and higher PA signal generation than single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and AuNRs. 210 As an imaging probe to localize specific diseases or tissues, SPNs can produce PA signals in the sites of interest, relying on simple accumulation via the retention effect or receptor binding on the cell surface. This strategy leads to the application of LN mapping, 210 in vivo tumor-targeted imaging, [211][212][213] cell tracking, 214 and ROS mapping. 134 For example, SPN with poly as cyclopentadithiophene-altbenzothiadiazole showed a maximum NIR-I absorption at 660 nm and maximum PA signals at 690 nm, and it was used as PAI probes for lymphatic imaging. 210 Another recently reported SPNs, which was fabricated into water-dispersed NPs, showed strong absorption in the NIR-II window and efficient cellular uptake, leading to effective accumulation in subcutaneous tumors and brain tumors. 212 ther than the simple accumulation of agents, SPNs also can be employed as activable PA probes with biomarker-triggered signals, which offer measurable and quantifiable real-time information on pathological status at the molecular level. Such smart PA probes have been used for in vivo imaging of a variety of biomarkers and biological metabolites in recent years, including abnormal pH, 215 different ROS imaging (such as ONOO \u2212 and CLO \u2212 level, 134,210 O2 \u2022\u2212 level 216 ), and granzyme B. 104 The reader can refer to Ref. 104 for more details on activatable SP nanoprobe (SPNP), which was reported as a biomarker to detect granzyme B in the tumors of living mice. Granzyme B can be considered to be a signature of immune activation due to elevated concentration in cytotoxic T lymphocytes.",

A. Malik, M. Pramanik\n## Abstract\nAbstract. Significance: Deep tissue noninvasive high-resolution imaging with light is challenging due to the high degree of light absorption and scattering in biological tissue. Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) can overcome some of the challenges of pure optical or ultrasound imaging to provide high-resolution deep tissue imaging. However, label-free PAI signals from light absorbing chromophores within the tissue are nonspecific. The use of exogeneous contrast agents (probes) not only enhances the imaging contrast (and imaging depth) but also increases the specificity of PAI by binding only to targeted molecules and often providing signals distinct from the background. Aim: We aim to review the current development and future progression of photoacoustic molecular probes/contrast agents. Approach: First, PAI and the need for using contrast agents are briefly introduced. Then, the recent development of contrast agents in terms of materials used to construct them is discussed. Then, various probes are discussed based on targeting mechanisms, in vivo molecular imaging applications, multimodal uses, and use in theranostic applications. Results: Material combinations are being used to develop highly specific contrast agents. In addition to passive accumulation, probes utilizing activation mechanisms show promise for greater controllability. Several probes also enable concurrent multimodal use with fluorescence, ultrasound, Raman, magnetic resonance imaging, and computed tomography. Finally, targeted probes are also shown to aid localized and molecularly specific photo-induced therapy. Conclusions: The development of contrast agents provides a promising prospect for increased contrast, higher imaging depth, and molecularly specific information. Of note are agents that allow for controlled activation, explore other optical windows, and enable multimodal use to overcome some of the shortcomings of label-free PAI.\n## Semiconducting Polymer Nanoparticles\nSemiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) are advanced organic materials that have been applied in many imaging modalities, including fluorescent imaging, US imaging, and PAI. The advantages of SPNs are numerous and include large absorption coefficient, tunable absorption, high photostability, low toxicity, 86 high structural flexibility, small size, and higher PA signal generation than single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and AuNRs. 210 As an imaging probe to localize specific diseases or tissues, SPNs can produce PA signals in the sites of interest, relying on simple accumulation via the retention effect or receptor binding on the cell surface. This strategy leads to the application of LN mapping, 210 in vivo tumor-targeted imaging, [211][212][213] cell tracking, 214 and ROS mapping. 134 For example, SPN with poly as cyclopentadithiophene-altbenzothiadiazole showed a maximum NIR-I absorption at 660 nm and maximum PA signals at 690 nm, and it was used as PAI probes for lymphatic imaging. 210 Another recently reported SPNs, which was fabricated into water-dispersed NPs, showed strong absorption in the NIR-II window and efficient cellular uptake, leading to effective accumulation in subcutaneous tumors and brain tumors. 212 ther than the simple accumulation of agents, SPNs also can be employed as activable PA probes with biomarker-triggered signals, which offer measurable and quantifiable real-time information on pathological status at the molecular level. Such smart PA probes have been used for in vivo imaging of a variety of biomarkers and biological metabolites in recent years, including abnormal pH, 215 different ROS imaging (such as ONOO \u2212 and CLO \u2212 level, 134,210 O2 \u2022\u2212 level 216 ), and granzyme B. 104 The reader can refer to Ref. 104 for more details on activatable SP nanoprobe (SPNP), which was reported as a biomarker to detect granzyme B in the tumors of living mice. Granzyme B can be considered to be a signature of immune activation due to elevated concentration in cytotoxic T lymphocytes.",

                    "text": "Pu and coworkers reported NIR-absorbing semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) as an efficient and stable nanoplatform to generate ultrasound wave for in vivo photoacoustic molecular imaging [71] . Two polymer derivatives with strong absorption within the NIR region were chosen (Figure 4A-4C). These nanoparticles produced a stronger signal than the commonly used single-walled carbon nanotubes and gold nanorods, permitting whole-body lymph node photoacoustic mapping in living mice with low-volume injections (Figure 4D). Furthermore, they coupled the nanoparticles to a cyanine dye derivative (IR775S) that was sensitive to ROS-mediated oxidation to obtain a probe for ROS imaging. This example of ROS imaging demonstrated that the conjugated polymer nanoparticles possessed high structural flexibility and could be an ideal nanoplatform for photoacoustic molecular probes. The PA signal comes mainly from photothermal conversion. Thereby, the criterion for selecting PA imaging probes is consistent with that for PTT. This similarity makes PA and PTT an ideal pair to be seamlessly and synergistically combined into theranostics. Lyu and co-workers further confirmed that the PA intensity of SPNs was proportional to their photothermal conversion efficiency and thus envisioned the utility of SPNs in cancer treatment [72] . Recently, Fan et al demonstrated perylenediimide-based nanoparticles as highly efficient photoacoustic agents for deep brain tumor imaging [73] . \n\nCompared to single modality, MM imaging can satisfy the increasing requirements in advanced biotechnology. Sun and co-workers developed conjugated polymer-labeled magnetic nanoparticles using a layer-by-layer assembly technique for dual-modal fluorescent-magnetic resonance imaging [74,75] (Figure 5A and 5B). The fluorescent-magnetic nanoparticles were used for both tracking the cellular uptake of nanomaterials and controlling the cellular uptake by an external magnetic field. The results demonstrated a higher uptake ability of the fluorescence-labeled magnetic nanoparticles with the aid of a magnetic field. Subsequently, Li and co-workers synthesized Reproduced with permission from Ref [71] .",

This review highlights the recent advances in the utilization of CPNs in theranostics. Specifically, CPN-based in vivo imaging techniques, including near-infrared (NIR) imaging, two-photon (TP) imaging, photoacoustic (PA) imaging, and multimodal (MM) imaging, are introduced. Then, CPN-based photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT) are surveyed. A variety of stimuli-responsive CPN systems for drug delivery are also summarized, and the promising trends and translational challenges are discussed.\n## Acta Pharmacologica Sinica\nPu and coworkers reported NIR-absorbing semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) as an efficient and stable nanoplatform to generate ultrasound wave for in vivo photoacoustic molecular imaging [71] . Two polymer derivatives with strong absorption within the NIR region were chosen (Figure 4A-4C). These nanoparticles produced a stronger signal than the commonly used single-walled carbon nanotubes and gold nanorods, permitting whole-body lymph node photoacoustic mapping in living mice with low-volume injections (Figure 4D). Furthermore, they coupled the nanoparticles to a cyanine dye derivative (IR775S) that was sensitive to ROS-mediated oxidation to obtain a probe for ROS imaging. This example of ROS imaging demonstrated that the conjugated polymer nanoparticles possessed high structural flexibility and could be an ideal nanoplatform for photoacoustic molecular probes. The PA signal comes mainly from photothermal conversion. Thereby, the criterion for selecting PA imaging probes is consistent with that for PTT. This similarity makes PA and PTT an ideal pair to be seamlessly and synergistically combined into theranostics. Lyu and co-workers further confirmed that the PA intensity of SPNs was proportional to their photothermal conversion efficiency and thus envisioned the utility of SPNs in cancer treatment [72] . Recently, Fan et al demonstrated perylenediimide-based nanoparticles as highly efficient photoacoustic agents for deep brain tumor imaging [73] . \n\nCompared to single modality, MM imaging can satisfy the increasing requirements in advanced biotechnology. Sun and co-workers developed conjugated polymer-labeled magnetic nanoparticles using a layer-by-layer assembly technique for dual-modal fluorescent-magnetic resonance imaging [74,75] (Figure 5A and 5B). The fluorescent-magnetic nanoparticles were used for both tracking the cellular uptake of nanomaterials and controlling the cellular uptake by an external magnetic field. The results demonstrated a higher uptake ability of the fluorescence-labeled magnetic nanoparticles with the aid of a magnetic field. Subsequently, Li and co-workers synthesized Reproduced with permission from Ref [71] .",

Organic semiconducting nanomaterials (OSNs) constructed from \u03c0\u2010conjugated organic semiconducting polymers or oligomers have unique advantages including high photostability, flexible optical features, and good biocompatibility due to the totally organic and biologically inert constituents. These advantages make OSNs more promising for in vivo phototheranostics. We here make a brief review about recent progress of OSNs\u2010assisted phototheranostics conducted in the NIR\u2010II biological window. NIR\u2010II fluorescence imaging and photoacoustic imaging are mainly reviewed as diagnostic modalities to guide various treatments.

In such, light scattering still cannot be ignored, although NIR-II fluorescence signals are recorded. To improve the deep tissue imaging quality and therapeutic efficiency, Fan et al demonstrated the application of 1064-nm activatable NIR-II FI-guided NIR-II PTT by using squaraine-based semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (PSQPNs-DBCO). 59 As mentioned above, Fan's group developed squaraine-based nanoparticles excited by a wavelength of 808 nm to achieve bright NIR-II FI and PTT. Based on this, squarainebased polymer (PSQP) with redshifted excitation and emission wavelength was further obtained by extending the conjugated length of semiconducting backbone. Waterdispersed nanoparticles (PSQPNs) were prepared by selfassembly process using amphiphilic DSPE-PEG 5000 -NH 2 , which were further modified with alkynyl groups on the nanoparticle surface to obtain PSQPNs-DBCO (Figure 5C). The PSQPNs-DBCO showed maximum emission peak at 1290 nm under 1064-nm laser excitation, making it possible for NIR-II-triggered NIR-II FI and therapy. As expected, PSQPNs-DBCO exhibited enhanced SNR by fourfold compared with the reported TT-3T CPs, which is a 808-nm light-responsive NIR-II fluorescence dye.",

Currently, most existing agents developed for NIR\u2010II phototheranostics are limited to inorganic nanoparticles and small\u2010molecule dyes, which suffer from the issues of long\u2010term biotoxicity and poor photostability, respectively. Organic semiconducting nanomaterials (OSNs) constructed from \u03c0\u2010conjugated organic semiconducting polymers or oligomers have unique advantages including high photostability, flexible optical features, and good biocompatibility due to the totally organic and biologically inert constituents. These advantages make OSNs more promising for in vivo phototheranostics. We here make a brief review about recent progress of OSNs\u2010assisted phototheranostics conducted in the NIR\u2010II biological window. NIR\u2010II fluorescence imaging and photoacoustic imaging are mainly reviewed as diagnostic modalities to guide various treatments. Besides, multimodal phototheranostics using OSNs in NIR\u2010II window is also described. At last, the challenges and outlook for OSNs\u2010assisted NIR\u2010II phototheranostics are discussed.\n## Photothermal therapy\nIn vivo imaging of mice brain and body showed remarkable superiority of SQP-NPs (J) relative to SQP-NPs (H) with much stronger fluorescence brightness. With the NIR-II fluorescence visualization of tumor, LED light lamp (810 nm, 0.8 W/cm 2 ) was employed to irradiate the tumor-bearing mice after injection of SQP-NPs (J) , which exhibited excellent tumor inhibition effect. ). Reprinted with permission from National Academy of Sciences. 56 e second problem is the limited excitation laser with relatively short wavelength in NIR-I window for most reported NIR-II FI. In such, light scattering still cannot be ignored, although NIR-II fluorescence signals are recorded. To improve the deep tissue imaging quality and therapeutic efficiency, Fan et al demonstrated the application of 1064-nm activatable NIR-II FI-guided NIR-II PTT by using squaraine-based semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (PSQPNs-DBCO). 59 As mentioned above, Fan's group developed squaraine-based nanoparticles excited by a wavelength of 808 nm to achieve bright NIR-II FI and PTT. Based on this, squarainebased polymer (PSQP) with redshifted excitation and emission wavelength was further obtained by extending the conjugated length of semiconducting backbone. Waterdispersed nanoparticles (PSQPNs) were prepared by selfassembly process using amphiphilic DSPE-PEG 5000 -NH 2 , which were further modified with alkynyl groups on the nanoparticle surface to obtain PSQPNs-DBCO (Figure 5C). The PSQPNs-DBCO showed maximum emission peak at 1290 nm under 1064-nm laser excitation, making it possible for NIR-II-triggered NIR-II FI and therapy. As expected, PSQPNs-DBCO exhibited enhanced SNR by fourfold compared with the reported TT-3T CPs, which is a 808-nm light-responsive NIR-II fluorescence dye.",

Liao, Youjuan Wang, Ling Hu, Xiaobing Zhang\n## Abstract\nNonspecific adhesivity of nanoparticles to cells is regarded as a significant issue of nanomedicine, which brings about many serious drawbacks in applications, including low detection sensitivity, non-targeted biotoxicity and poor diagnostic accuracy. Here, we propose for the first time, DNA-decorated semiconductor polymer nanoparticles (SPN-DNAs), whose adhesivity can be significantly alleviated by controlling the density and thickness of DNA layers. This property is demonstrated to be independent of external conditions such as temperature, concentration, incubation time, ionic strength and cell lines. The mechanism of this phenomenon is also discussed. Finally, based on minimized nonspecific adhesivity to cells, a triggered nanoswitch can be constructed to control cellular internalization and drug delivery.\n## Introduction\nOrganic polymeric nanoparticles (OPNs) have shown splendid promise in bioanalysis and biomedical applications. 1 For instance, the semiconductor polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) have emerged as attractive imaging nanoagents due to their large absorption coefficients, high photostability and tuneable optical properties. 2 Currently, various SPNs-based nanoprobes with multifunctional light-responsive characteristics, such as \ue104uorescence, photoacoustic and photothermal, have been developed for tumor imaging and cancer therapy in vivo. 3,4 owever, these nanoparticles (NPs) with hydrophobic core and relatively large particle sizes have been reported to show strong nonspeci\ue103c adhesivity to cells, which leads to many serious issues in applications, including low detection sensitivity, nontargeted biotoxicity and poor diagnostic accuracy, eventually hampering their future clinical applications. 5,6 n order to reduce the nonspeci\ue103c adhesivity of NPs to cells, many strategies have been adopted, such as size reduction, 7 rapid charge reversal, 8 and surface coating. 9 Among them, the surface coating strategy has been extensively studied. 10 For example, a series of nonionic and hydrophilic polymers are employed in coating NPs, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), 11 poly(glyceryl monomethacrylate) (PGMMA), 6 polyphosphoester (PPE), 12 and hyperbranched polyglycerol (HPG). 13 These polymer coatings can impart the NPs with a steric repulsion and hydration molecular layer, which can reduce the hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions between NPs and biomolecules, thereby alleviating the nonspeci\ue103c adhesivity of NPs to cells. 5 imultaneously, targeting units are modi\ue103ed on the NPs to enhance the internalization by target cells. 11,12 However, due to the heterogeneous expression of receptors on the surface of tumor cells, these NPs are internalized by target cells with different efficiencies, resulting in inaccurate imaging and therapy. 14,15",

However, current strategies to treat PDAC generally have low efficacy and high side-effects, therefore, effective treatment against PDAC remains an urgent need. Results We report a semiconducting polymer nano-radiopharmaceutical with intrinsic photothermal capability and labeling with therapeutic radioisotope 177 Lu ( 177 Lu-SPN-GIP) for combined radio- and photothermal therapy of pancreatic tumor. 177 Lu-SPN-GIP endowed good stability at physiological conditions, high cell uptake, and long retention time in tumor site. By virtue of combined radiotherapy (RT) and photothermal therapy (PTT), 177 Lu-SPN-GIP exhibited enhanced therapeutic capability to kill cancer cells and xenograft tumor in living mice compared with RT or PTT alone. More importantly, 177 Lu-SPN-GIP could suppress the growth of the tumor stem cells and reverse epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), which may greatly reduce the occurrence of metastasis. Conclusion Such strategy we developed could improve therapeutic outcomes over traditional RT as it is able to ablate tumor with relatively lower doses of radiopharmaceuticals to reduce its side effects.

Compared with other inorganic nanomaterials such as gold nanorods and carbon nanotubes, SPNs possess unique characteristics such as better biocompatibility, higher NIR absorption and photothermal conversion efficiency, feasibility and controllability [30][31][32][33][34]. In particular, SPNs not only allow for convenient chemical engineering of backbones and side chains for on-demand functionalization, but also are conducive to nanoengineering to achieve size or morphology controllability [35]. To date, the utilization of SPNs for PTT has been fully explored, but combined therapy are rarely reported [10,36,37]. \n\nIn this study, we develop a 177 Lu-labeled semiconducting polymer nano-radiopharmaceutical with glucosedependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) as tumor targeting group ( 177 Lu-SPN-GIP) for combined RT and PTT of PDAC (Scheme 1a). 177 Lu-SPN-GIP was designed to comprise radioactive 177 Lu as a tracer for SPECT/ CT imaging and also as a killer for tumor with a SPN to serve for PTT treatment of cancer. Such combination of different treatment techniques could complement each other, offering accurate monitoring and comprehensive therapeutic effects relative to PTT or RT alone. This is a simple yet effective approach to fabricate SPNs-based multifunctional theranostic nanoplatform for treatment of pancreatic tumor.",

However, current strategies to treat PDAC generally have low efficacy and high side-effects, therefore, effective treatment against PDAC remains an urgent need. Results We report a semiconducting polymer nano-radiopharmaceutical with intrinsic photothermal capability and labeling with therapeutic radioisotope 177 Lu ( 177 Lu-SPN-GIP) for combined radio- and photothermal therapy of pancreatic tumor. 177 Lu-SPN-GIP endowed good stability at physiological conditions, high cell uptake, and long retention time in tumor site. By virtue of combined radiotherapy (RT) and photothermal therapy (PTT), 177 Lu-SPN-GIP exhibited enhanced therapeutic capability to kill cancer cells and xenograft tumor in living mice compared with RT or PTT alone. More importantly, 177 Lu-SPN-GIP could suppress the growth of the tumor stem cells and reverse epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), which may greatly reduce the occurrence of metastasis. Conclusion Such strategy we developed could improve therapeutic outcomes over traditional RT as it is able to ablate tumor with relatively lower doses of radiopharmaceuticals to reduce its side effects. Graphical abstract\n## Graphical abstract:\nKeywords: Semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs), Radiopharmaceuticals, Pancreatic cancer, Combined therapy, Radiotherapy, Photothermal therapy [26][27][28][29]. Compared with other inorganic nanomaterials such as gold nanorods and carbon nanotubes, SPNs possess unique characteristics such as better biocompatibility, higher NIR absorption and photothermal conversion efficiency, feasibility and controllability [30][31][32][33][34]. In particular, SPNs not only allow for convenient chemical engineering of backbones and side chains for on-demand functionalization, but also are conducive to nanoengineering to achieve size or morphology controllability [35]. To date, the utilization of SPNs for PTT has been fully explored, but combined therapy are rarely reported [10,36,37]. \n\nIn this study, we develop a 177 Lu-labeled semiconducting polymer nano-radiopharmaceutical with glucosedependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) as tumor targeting group ( 177 Lu-SPN-GIP) for combined RT and PTT of PDAC (Scheme 1a). 177 Lu-SPN-GIP was designed to comprise radioactive 177 Lu as a tracer for SPECT/ CT imaging and also as a killer for tumor with a SPN to serve for PTT treatment of cancer. Such combination of different treatment techniques could complement each other, offering accurate monitoring and comprehensive therapeutic effects relative to PTT or RT alone. This is a simple yet effective approach to fabricate SPNs-based multifunctional theranostic nanoplatform for treatment of pancreatic tumor.",

Methods: Herein, multi-responsive semiconducting polymer semi-interpenetrating nanoparticles (PDPP3T@PNIPAMAA IPNs) with highly stable structure and uniform size have been successfully designed by semi-interpenetrating technique. Results: It is proposed for the first time that PDPP3T@PNIPAMAA IPNs were prepared with \u201creinforced concrete\u201d particle structure, which is even resistant to organic solvent such as ethanol and THF. By adjusting the polymerization time, the obtained PDPP3T@PNIPAMAA IPNs exhibit uniform and controllable particle size with extremely low polydispersity index (~0.037) at 1 h of reaction time. The presence of pH/light/GSH multi-responsive semi-interpenetrating network in PDPP3T@PNIPAMAA IPNs dramatically increase their drug loading efficiency (92.64%), which is significantly higher than previously reported comparable SPNs-based drug delivery systems. Additionally, PDPP3T@PNIPAMAA-DOX IPNs further provide improved therapeutic efficacy by the combination of chemotherapy and photothermal therapy with controllably regulated release of doxorubicin (DOX). In vitro and in vivo results indicate that PDPP3T@PNIPAMAA-DOX IPNs are able to release drugs at controlled rate by pH/light/GSH regulation and offer PAI-guided chemo/photothermal combined therapy with excellent therapeutic efficacy. Conclusions: The semi-interpenetrating network method may be generally extended for the preparation of a wide range of organic polymer nanoparticles to achieve ultrahigh structural stability, precise particle size controllability and excellent drug loading capacity.",

Despite the progress of SPNs in nanomedicine in recent years, fabrication techniques for SPNs with structurally stability and multi-functionality are still Ivyspring International Publisher in its infancy and confronted with great challenges. \n\nThe synthetic techniques for making semiconducting polymer nanoparticles are generally limited to emulsion technique and nanoprecipitation method [10][11][12][13]. However, these techniques offer poor control of SPNs size and produce SPNs with different particle size [14].

Methods: Herein, multi-responsive semiconducting polymer semi-interpenetrating nanoparticles (PDPP3T@PNIPAMAA IPNs) with highly stable structure and uniform size have been successfully designed by semi-interpenetrating technique. Results: It is proposed for the first time that PDPP3T@PNIPAMAA IPNs were prepared with \u201creinforced concrete\u201d particle structure, which is even resistant to organic solvent such as ethanol and THF. By adjusting the polymerization time, the obtained PDPP3T@PNIPAMAA IPNs exhibit uniform and controllable particle size with extremely low polydispersity index (~0.037) at 1 h of reaction time. The presence of pH/light/GSH multi-responsive semi-interpenetrating network in PDPP3T@PNIPAMAA IPNs dramatically increase their drug loading efficiency (92.64%), which is significantly higher than previously reported comparable SPNs-based drug delivery systems. Additionally, PDPP3T@PNIPAMAA-DOX IPNs further provide improved therapeutic efficacy by the combination of chemotherapy and photothermal therapy with controllably regulated release of doxorubicin (DOX). In vitro and in vivo results indicate that PDPP3T@PNIPAMAA-DOX IPNs are able to release drugs at controlled rate by pH/light/GSH regulation and offer PAI-guided chemo/photothermal combined therapy with excellent therapeutic efficacy. Conclusions: The semi-interpenetrating network method may be generally extended for the preparation of a wide range of organic polymer nanoparticles to achieve ultrahigh structural stability, precise particle size controllability and excellent drug loading capacity.\n## Introduction\nSemiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) have found tremendous success in recent years as promising theranostic agent owing to their good optical properties, high photostability and outstanding biocompatibility [1][2][3][4][5].

            "abstract": "Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) holds growing promise in deep\u2010seated or large solid tumor treatment owing to its high tissue penetration depth ability; however, its therapeutic efficacy is often compromised due to the hypopermeable and hypoxic characteristics in the tumor milieu. Herein, a semiconducting polymer nanoparticle (SPNC) that synergistically enhances tumor penetration and alleviates tumor hypoxia is reported for sonodynamic therapy of large solid tumors. SPNC comprises a semiconducting polymer nanoparticle core as a sonodynamic converter coated with a poly (ethylene glycol) corona. An oxygen\u2010modulating enzyme, catalase, is efficiently conjugated to the surface of nanoparticles via the coupling reaction. Superior to its counterpart SPNCs (SPNC2 (84 nm) and SPNC3 (134 nm)), SPNC with the smallest size (SPNC1 (35 nm)) can efficiently penetrate throughout the tumor interstitium to alleviate whole tumor hypoxia in a large solid tumor model.

Herein, a semiconducting polymer nanoparticle (SPNC) that synergistically enhances tumor penetration and alleviates tumor hypoxia is reported for sonodynamic therapy of large solid tumors. SPNC comprises a semiconducting polymer nanoparticle core as a sonodynamic converter coated with a poly (ethylene glycol) corona. An oxygen\u2010modulating enzyme, catalase, is efficiently conjugated to the surface of nanoparticles via the coupling reaction. Superior to its counterpart SPNCs (SPNC2 (84 nm) and SPNC3 (134 nm)), SPNC with the smallest size (SPNC1 (35 nm)) can efficiently penetrate throughout the tumor interstitium to alleviate whole tumor hypoxia in a large solid tumor model. Upon ultrasound (US) irradiation, SPNC1 can remotely generate sufficient singlet oxygen to eradicate tumor cells at a deep\u2010tissue depth.

            "abstract": "Abstract Cancer is a devastating health problem with inadequate treatment options. Many conventional treatments for solid-tumor cancers lack tumor specificity, which results in low efficacy and off-target damage to healthy tissues. Nanoparticle (NP)-mediated photothermal therapy (PTT) is a promising minimally invasive treatment for solid-tumor cancers that has entered clinical trials. Traditionally, NPs used for PTT are coated with passivating agents and/or targeting ligands, but alternative coatings are being explored to enhance tumor specific delivery. In particular, cell-derived membranes have emerged as promising coatings that improve the biointerfacing of photoactive NPs, which reduces their immune recognition, prolongs their systemic circulation and increases their tumor accumulation, allowing for more effective PTT. To maximize treatment success, membrane-wrapped nanoparticles (MWNPs) that enable dual tumor imaging and PTT are being explored. These multifunctional theranostic NPs can be used to enhance tumor detection and/or ensure a sufficient quantity of NPs that have arrived in the tumor prior to laser irradiation. This review summarizes the current state-of-the-art in engineering MWNPs for combination cancer imaging and PTT and discusses considerations for the path toward clinical translation.

                    "text": "Semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) are another promising platform that has been explored for image-guided PTT of cancer, as their excellent photonic properties allow them to support PA imaging, FL imaging and PTT. One elegant example is poly-(cyclopentadithiophene-alt-benzothiadiazole) (PCPDTBT) NPs, which were wrapped with activated fibroblast membranes to form AF-SPNs capable of multimodal cancer phototheranostics [15]. The use of activated fibroblast membranes is a unique and sophisticated approach to target homologous cancer-associated fibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment, which surround the tumor and produce extracellular matrix components and thus act as a physical barrier that impedes NP delivery deep within tumors [50]. To test the tumor-targeting ability of AF-SPNs in vivo, nude mice bearing 4T1 xenografts were IV injected with either AF-SPNs, unwrapped SPNs (uSPNs) or 4T1 murine breast cancer cell membrane-wrapped SPNs (CC-SPNs). At 48 h post IV injection, the maximal PA intensity enhancement (DPA) in the tumors of AF-SPN treated mice was 1.8-and 1.5-fold higher than that for uSPN and CC-SPN treated mice, respectively. These results were consistent with FL images in which the tumor FL intensity of AF-SPN treated mice was 1.5-and 1.3-fold higher than that of uSPN and CC-SPN injected mice, respectively. After tumors were exposed to 808 nm light (0.3 W/cm 2 , 5 min), the maximal tumor temperature was 50 \ufffd C for AF-SPN injected mice, which was 4.0 and 6.0 \ufffd C higher than that for CC-SPN and uSPN injected mice, respectively. Congruently, tumor volumes decreased to the greatest extent in mice that received irradiation plus AF-SPNs. Overall, this study confirmed that targeting activated fibroblasts with MWNPs is a promising approach to enhance cancer imaging and PTT.",

Aboeleneen, Mackenzie A. Scully, George C. Kramarenko, E. S. Day\n## Abstract\nAbstract Cancer is a devastating health problem with inadequate treatment options. Many conventional treatments for solid-tumor cancers lack tumor specificity, which results in low efficacy and off-target damage to healthy tissues. Nanoparticle (NP)-mediated photothermal therapy (PTT) is a promising minimally invasive treatment for solid-tumor cancers that has entered clinical trials. Traditionally, NPs used for PTT are coated with passivating agents and/or targeting ligands, but alternative coatings are being explored to enhance tumor specific delivery. In particular, cell-derived membranes have emerged as promising coatings that improve the biointerfacing of photoactive NPs, which reduces their immune recognition, prolongs their systemic circulation and increases their tumor accumulation, allowing for more effective PTT. To maximize treatment success, membrane-wrapped nanoparticles (MWNPs) that enable dual tumor imaging and PTT are being explored. These multifunctional theranostic NPs can be used to enhance tumor detection and/or ensure a sufficient quantity of NPs that have arrived in the tumor prior to laser irradiation. This review summarizes the current state-of-the-art in engineering MWNPs for combination cancer imaging and PTT and discusses considerations for the path toward clinical translation. GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n## Semiconducting materials for combined PA imaging and PTT\nSemiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) are another promising platform that has been explored for image-guided PTT of cancer, as their excellent photonic properties allow them to support PA imaging, FL imaging and PTT. One elegant example is poly-(cyclopentadithiophene-alt-benzothiadiazole) (PCPDTBT) NPs, which were wrapped with activated fibroblast membranes to form AF-SPNs capable of multimodal cancer phototheranostics [15]. The use of activated fibroblast membranes is a unique and sophisticated approach to target homologous cancer-associated fibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment, which surround the tumor and produce extracellular matrix components and thus act as a physical barrier that impedes NP delivery deep within tumors [50]. To test the tumor-targeting ability of AF-SPNs in vivo, nude mice bearing 4T1 xenografts were IV injected with either AF-SPNs, unwrapped SPNs (uSPNs) or 4T1 murine breast cancer cell membrane-wrapped SPNs (CC-SPNs). At 48 h post IV injection, the maximal PA intensity enhancement (DPA) in the tumors of AF-SPN treated mice was 1.8-and 1.5-fold higher than that for uSPN and CC-SPN treated mice, respectively. These results were consistent with FL images in which the tumor FL intensity of AF-SPN treated mice was 1.5-and 1.3-fold higher than that of uSPN and CC-SPN injected mice, respectively. After tumors were exposed to 808 nm light (0.3 W/cm 2 , 5 min), the maximal tumor temperature was 50 \ufffd C for AF-SPN injected mice, which was 4.0 and 6.0 \ufffd C higher than that for CC-SPN and uSPN injected mice, respectively. Congruently, tumor volumes decreased to the greatest extent in mice that received irradiation plus AF-SPNs. Overall, this study confirmed that targeting activated fibroblasts with MWNPs is a promising approach to enhance cancer imaging and PTT.",

However, clinical translation of PAI based methods are still under scrutiny as the imaging quality and clinical information derived from PA images are not on par with other imaging methods. Hence, to improve PAI, exogenous contrast agents, in the form of nanomaterials, are being used to achieve better image with less side effects, lower accumulation, and improved target specificity. Nanomedicine has become inevitable in cancer management, as it contributes at every stage from diagnosis to therapy, surgery, and even in the postoperative care and surveillance for recurrence. Nanocontrast agents for PAI have been developed and are being explored for early and improved cancer diagnosis. The systemic stability and target specificity of the nanomaterials to render its theranostic property depends on various influencing factors such as the administration route and physico-chemical responsiveness. The recent focus in PAI is on targeting the lymphatic system and nodes for cancer diagnosis, as they play a vital role in cancer progression and metastasis. This review aims to discuss the clinical advancements of PAI using nanoparticles as exogenous contrast agents for cancer theranostics with emphasis on PAI of lymphatic system for diagnosis, cancer progression, metastasis, PAI guided tumor resection, and finally PAI guided drug delivery.

In addition to their exceptional photostability and biocompatibility, semiconducting polymers possess distinct advantages over the other nanoparticles in PA applications [90]. Successful detection of reactive oxygen species (ROS) using polymeric nanoparticles as nanoprobes has demonstrated that, these nanoparticles can be an excellent tool for the diagnosis of disease conditions such as tumor metastasis, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, obesity and etc., that involves ROS guided/influenced pathophysiological events [87]. Similarly, quantum dots represents another group of multifunctional nanoparticles with significant potential in photothermal therapy (PTT) and has made them a promising candidate to be a PA contrast agent [90]. Perfluorocarbon (PFC) are microbubble contrast agents, that showed great potential in ultrasound/PA based therapies and stimuli responsive drug delivery, when they were coupled with plasmonic nanoparticles [96]. Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) based polymeric nanoparticles and their derivatives were aided in tumor imaging with more than fivefold of the background signal at 2 h of the nanoparticle injection [87,97]. Benzothiadiazole moiety amplified the PA signal provided by the nanoparticles by twofolds [98]. Apart from imaging application for diagnosis, PA image guided photothermal/photodynamic therapy (PTT/PDT) was also achieved using semiconducting polymeric nanoparticles (Fig. 4) [97,99].",

Sridharan, Hae Gyun Lim\n## Abstract\nPhotoacoustic imaging (PAI) is a successful clinical imaging platform for management of cancer and other health conditions that has seen significant progress in the past decade. However, clinical translation of PAI based methods are still under scrutiny as the imaging quality and clinical information derived from PA images are not on par with other imaging methods. Hence, to improve PAI, exogenous contrast agents, in the form of nanomaterials, are being used to achieve better image with less side effects, lower accumulation, and improved target specificity. Nanomedicine has become inevitable in cancer management, as it contributes at every stage from diagnosis to therapy, surgery, and even in the postoperative care and surveillance for recurrence. Nanocontrast agents for PAI have been developed and are being explored for early and improved cancer diagnosis. The systemic stability and target specificity of the nanomaterials to render its theranostic property depends on various influencing factors such as the administration route and physico-chemical responsiveness. The recent focus in PAI is on targeting the lymphatic system and nodes for cancer diagnosis, as they play a vital role in cancer progression and metastasis. This review aims to discuss the clinical advancements of PAI using nanoparticles as exogenous contrast agents for cancer theranostics with emphasis on PAI of lymphatic system for diagnosis, cancer progression, metastasis, PAI guided tumor resection, and finally PAI guided drug delivery. Graphical Abstract\n## Organic/polymeric nanoparticles\nSemiconductive polymeric nanoparticles comprise the major part of organic nanoparticles that possess PA and fluorescence properties because they have NIR absorption property. In addition to their exceptional photostability and biocompatibility, semiconducting polymers possess distinct advantages over the other nanoparticles in PA applications [90]. Successful detection of reactive oxygen species (ROS) using polymeric nanoparticles as nanoprobes has demonstrated that, these nanoparticles can be an excellent tool for the diagnosis of disease conditions such as tumor metastasis, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, obesity and etc., that involves ROS guided/influenced pathophysiological events [87]. Similarly, quantum dots represents another group of multifunctional nanoparticles with significant potential in photothermal therapy (PTT) and has made them a promising candidate to be a PA contrast agent [90]. Perfluorocarbon (PFC) are microbubble contrast agents, that showed great potential in ultrasound/PA based therapies and stimuli responsive drug delivery, when they were coupled with plasmonic nanoparticles [96]. Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) based polymeric nanoparticles and their derivatives were aided in tumor imaging with more than fivefold of the background signal at 2 h of the nanoparticle injection [87,97]. Benzothiadiazole moiety amplified the PA signal provided by the nanoparticles by twofolds [98]. Apart from imaging application for diagnosis, PA image guided photothermal/photodynamic therapy (PTT/PDT) was also achieved using semiconducting polymeric nanoparticles (Fig. 4) [97,99].",

[192,193] his strategy addresses the limitations of traditional SDT by providing advantages, such as enhanced tissue penetration, and improved tumor targeting capacity. [194] ased on the advancement of SDT, Wang et al. recently designed a semiconducting polymer nano-PROTAC (SPN FeP , 72). [195] SPN FeP was synthesized through a self-assemble nanoprecipitation process by integrating a sonodynamic semiconducting polymer, a ferroptosis inducer (ferrocene), a ROScleavable amphiphilic polymer, and a nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase (NAMPT) PROTAC. Upon ultrasound irradiation to the tumor, the semiconducting polymer works as a sonosensitizer to generate singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ), while the ferroptosis inducer reacts with intratumoral hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) to produce hydroxyl radicals ( * OH). This dual-ROS generating programmable process cleaves the ROS-cleavable polymer and induces the release of NAMPT PROTAC within the tumor. This spatiotemporal control of NAMPT degradation leads to an effective suppression of tumor infiltration of myeloidderived suppressive cells, which enhances antitumor immunity. The ultrasound nanoplatform enables precise regulation of PROTAC release through a dual-programmable activation mechanism, thereby increasing antitumor efficacy in deeptissue tumors.",

While the potential druggability of PROTACs toward undruggable proteins has accelerated their rapid development and the wide\u2010range of applications across diverse disease contexts, off\u2010tissue effects and side\u2010effects of PROTACs have recently received attentions to improve their efficacy. To address these issues, spatial or temporal target protein degradation by PROTACs has been spotlighted. In this review, we explore chemical strategies for modulating protein degradation in a cell type\u2010specific (spatio\u2212) and time\u2010specific (temporal\u2212) manner, thereby offering insights for expanding PROTAC applications to overcome the current limitations of target protein degradation strategy.\n## Ultrasound Nano-PROTAC\n Conventional SDT faces several challenges due to the properties of current sonosensitizers including inherent hydrophobicity, tendency to aggregate, and poor pharmacokinetics. [191] However, recent advancements in nanotechnology have revolutionized SDT by utilizing sonosensitizerconjugated nanoparticles for selective tumor eradication. [192,193] his strategy addresses the limitations of traditional SDT by providing advantages, such as enhanced tissue penetration, and improved tumor targeting capacity. [194] ased on the advancement of SDT, Wang et al. recently designed a semiconducting polymer nano-PROTAC (SPN FeP , 72). [195] SPN FeP was synthesized through a self-assemble nanoprecipitation process by integrating a sonodynamic semiconducting polymer, a ferroptosis inducer (ferrocene), a ROScleavable amphiphilic polymer, and a nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase (NAMPT) PROTAC. Upon ultrasound irradiation to the tumor, the semiconducting polymer works as a sonosensitizer to generate singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ), while the ferroptosis inducer reacts with intratumoral hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) to produce hydroxyl radicals ( * OH). This dual-ROS generating programmable process cleaves the ROS-cleavable polymer and induces the release of NAMPT PROTAC within the tumor. This spatiotemporal control of NAMPT degradation leads to an effective suppression of tumor infiltration of myeloidderived suppressive cells, which enhances antitumor immunity. The ultrasound nanoplatform enables precise regulation of PROTAC release through a dual-programmable activation mechanism, thereby increasing antitumor efficacy in deeptissue tumors.",

Zou, Beibei Wu, Yanyan Dong, Zhangwei Song, Ya-ping Zhao, X. Ni, Yan Yang, Zhe Liu\n## Abstract\nPhotoacoustic imaging (PAI) is an integrated biomedical imaging modality which combines the advantages of acoustic deep penetration and optical high sensitivity. It can provide functional and structural images with satisfactory resolution and contrast which could provide abundant pathological information for disease-oriented diagnosis. Therefore, it has found vast applications so far and become a powerful tool of precision nanomedicine. However, the investigation of PAI-based imaging nanomaterials is still in its infancy. This perspective article aims to summarize the developments in photoacoustic technologies and instrumentations in the past years, and more importantly, present a bright outlook for advanced PAI-based imaging nanomaterials as well as their emerging biomedical applications in nanomedicine. Current challenges and bottleneck issues have also been discussed and elucidated in this article to bring them to the attention of the readership.\n## semi-conductive nanoparticles\nSemi-conductive polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) are an emerging type of PAI nanomaterials, and have displayed excellent properties such as non-blinking, low toxicity, prominent FL and excellent photostability. 57 Therefore, with a good control of surface chemistry and versatile modifications of functional groups, enormous SPNs have emerged as contrast agents for cell labeling and PAI. 58 SPNs can be further developed into NIR ratiometric nanoprobes for in vivo imaging of reaction oxygen species (ROS). Considering that ROS acts as a specific biomarker in many pathological processes, SPNs-based nanomaterials are promisingly utilized in the study of strokes, tumor metastasis, bacterial infections and cardiomyopathy.\n\nQuantum dots are another kind of semi-conductive nanocrystals with tiny dimensions but wide excitation spectra. They have exhibited a great potential as multifunctional nanomaterials for multimodal molecular imaging and PPT",

These agents possess higher absorption coefficients, more tunable optical properties, and controllable dimensions compared with inorganic agents (Hong et al., 2012a;Pu et al., 2014a). The wavelength range 650-1,000 nm of NIR fluorescence imaging is known as the first NIR window (NIR-I), which can achieve a tissue penetration depth of up to \u22481 cm (Shanmugam et al., 2014). However, when NIR-I light passes through or interacts with the tissue, it still suffers from light scattering, tissue absorption, and autofluorescence (Ntziachristos, 2010), leading to a relatively poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and thus is less ideal for deep-tissue imaging. To enhance the imaging depth, the second near-infrared window (NIR-II, 1,000-1,700 nm), a more ideal region with deeper tissuepenetration depth and fewer light-tissue interactions, has been explored recently (Miao and Pu, 2018;Cai et al., 2019). To date, organic semiconducting agents have been utilized for deep-tissue imaging, including NIR-II fluorescence, self-luminescence, and PA imaging, in biomedical fields such as cell (Wu et al., 2010;Pu et al., 2014b), tumor (Wu et al., 2011b), acute edema (Pu et al., 2014b), and cardiovascular imaging (Hong et al., 2014) and in real-time evaluation of drug-toxicity (Shuhendler et al., 2014).",

However, when NIR-I light passes through or interacts with the tissue, it still suffers from light scattering, tissue absorption, and autofluorescence (Ntziachristos, 2010), leading to a relatively poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and thus is less ideal for deep-tissue imaging. To enhance the imaging depth, the second near-infrared window (NIR-II, 1,000-1,700 nm), a more ideal region with deeper tissuepenetration depth and fewer light-tissue interactions, has been explored recently (Miao and Pu, 2018;Cai et al., 2019). To date, organic semiconducting agents have been utilized for deep-tissue imaging, including NIR-II fluorescence, self-luminescence, and PA imaging, in biomedical fields such as cell (Wu et al., 2010;Pu et al., 2014b), tumor (Wu et al., 2011b), acute edema (Pu et al., 2014b), and cardiovascular imaging (Hong et al., 2014) and in real-time evaluation of drug-toxicity (Shuhendler et al., 2014).",

[1,2]SPNs are typically formed from the self-assembly of semiconducting polymers (SPs).The hydrophobic nature of the polymers makes nanoparticle formation a thermodynamically favorable process.However, this hydrophobicity also decreases colloidal stability in aqueous buffer and promotes protein adhesion, leading to protein coronas.A common way to improve colloidal stability and reduce biofouling is to coprecipitate the semiconducting polymer with amphiphilic block copolymers, lipids, or surfactants.These additives shield the hydrophobic polymers from the aqueous environment.However, the resulting binary micelles may be prone to heterogeneity, require purification, and raise questions of short-and long-term stability in a biological context. [3]o circumvent the issues caused by coprecipitation, singlecomponent systems have been explored.These commonly consist of graft copolymers of SPs with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) side chains.[6][7][8] In addition, the optoelectronic performance of graft copolymers for cancer theranostics has been shown to be improved when compared to coprecipitation. [9,10]However, graft copolymer synthesis is typically complex and potentially difficult to scale, often requiring the multistep functionalization and purification of monomer precursors and various postpolymerization modifications.

SPNs exhibit a large range of quantum yield due to factors inherent to their structure, including size and morphology and chemical composition, as well as external factors such as solvent polarity and temperature. SPNs may be adapted for NIR-II fluorescence or PA imaging [41]. \n\nRelatively few SPNs have been engineered toward NIR-II fluorescence imaging as small-molecule fluorophores in NIR-II fluorescence imaging are limited by low fluorescence quantum yields. However, Hong et al. synthesized a polymer fluorophore to emit in the NIR-II window-the first to do so [29]. The polymer, pegylated and composed of poly (benzo [1,2-b: 3,4-b0] difuran-alt-fluorothieno-[3,4-b] thiophene) (named 'pDA'), has a fluorescence quantum yield of 1.7% and is tuned to an emission peak of 1040 nm. This enabled the real-time tracking of arterial blood flow in the mouse at 25 frames per second in the NIR-II window. In a separate study, an advanced imaging technique called optical resolution photoacoustic microscopy (ORPAMI) was employed along with bright nearinfrared II (NIR-II)-conjugated polymer nanoparticles (CP NPs) to accurately identify tumor and cerebral tissue vasculatures [77]. \n\nThe generally high photothermal conversion efficiencies of SPNs are advantageous for PA imaging. Zhen et al. outlined a screening process to elucidate the relationship between SP molecular structure and PA properties [76].",

SPNs are constructed by encapsulating hydrophobic semiconducting polymers (SPs) with amphiphilic copolymers, and have shown great promise for phototheranostics of cancer. The authors review recent advances of thiadiazoloquinoxaline (TQ)-based SPNs from their synthesis and hydrophilic functionalization to NIR-II (1,000\u20131,700 nm) fluorescence imagingguided cancer photothermal therapy (PTT). To enhance the PTT efficiency, they also discuss methods for constructing SPNs with capability of multimodal imaging.

Poly(cyclopentadithiophene-alt-benzothiadiazole) had been chosen to build SPNs by surfactant-assisted nanoprecipitation because of its strong absorption in the NIR, suitable for PA and fluorescence imaging. The nanoparticles displayed an absorption peak at 660 nm, with a mass absorption coefficient of 93 mL mg \u22121 cm \u22121 . The PA performances of SPNs have been evaluated in comparison with GNRs and SWNTs, both in vitro and in vivo; 50 \u00b5g of nanoparticles were injected into mice for lymph node tracking by PA and fluorescence detection. The recorded amplitude of the PA signal increased by a factor of 10 after administration, allowing the clear visualization of several lymph nodes in the region of injection, confirmed by fluorescence imaging from the SPNs. The obtained PA amplitudes for SPNs have been found to be 4 times greater than the ones recorded for GNRs and SWNTs on a mass basis (Fig. 16).\n\nMoreover, by nanoprecipitating a semiconducting polymer with IR775S, a NIR dye sensitive to reactive oxygen species (ROS), the authors built a smart PA nanoprobe whose PA spectrum was sensitive to endogenously generated ONOO-and OCl-in vivo. Later, the same authors reported a new series of diketopyrrolopyrrole-based SPNs for in vivo PA imaging of tumor, as a proof-of-concept. The SPNs with the best perform-",

SPN-PT is formulated by nanoprecipitation method using a semiconducting polymer (PCPDTBT) encapsuled with polyethylene glycolylated (PEGylated) PT peptide to improve water solubility. With PT peptide, the SPNs can be internalized into OS cells in an active fashion, showing a faster uptake and good selectivity, permitting accurate early diagnosis for OS by NIR-II fluorescence and PA signals, providing efficient PTT and PDT in vitro and in vivo. In a word, an OS-targeted nanoplatform with dual model imaging ability and multiphototherapy effects is introduced, which enables OS early diagnosis with its high sensitivity and selectivity, and efficient treatments for OS with its phototherapies as well as targeting abilities.",

The advantages of SPNs are numerous and include large absorption coefficient, tunable absorption, high photostability, low toxicity, 86 high structural flexibility, small size, and higher PA signal generation than single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and AuNRs. 210 As an imaging probe to localize specific diseases or tissues, SPNs can produce PA signals in the sites of interest, relying on simple accumulation via the retention effect or receptor binding on the cell surface. This strategy leads to the application of LN mapping, 210 in vivo tumor-targeted imaging, [211][212][213] cell tracking, 214 and ROS mapping. 134 For example, SPN with poly as cyclopentadithiophene-altbenzothiadiazole showed a maximum NIR-I absorption at 660 nm and maximum PA signals at 690 nm, and it was used as PAI probes for lymphatic imaging. 210 Another recently reported SPNs, which was fabricated into water-dispersed NPs, showed strong absorption in the NIR-II window and efficient cellular uptake, leading to effective accumulation in subcutaneous tumors and brain tumors. 212 ther than the simple accumulation of agents, SPNs also can be employed as activable PA probes with biomarker-triggered signals, which offer measurable and quantifiable real-time information on pathological status at the molecular level. Such smart PA probes have been used for in vivo imaging of a variety of biomarkers and biological metabolites in recent years, including abnormal pH, 215 different ROS imaging (such as ONOO \u2212 and CLO \u2212 level, 134,210 O2 \u2022\u2212 level 216 ), and granzyme B. 104 The reader can refer to Ref. 104 for more details on activatable SP nanoprobe (SPNP), which was reported as a biomarker to detect granzyme B in the tumors of living mice.

            "text": "Previously there were few similar review articles published, particularly for photo acoustic imaging (PAI) [62] by Zhou et al. (2018), whereas a review article by Chan et al. (2015) focused on \"semiconducting polymer nanoparticles as fluorescent probes for biological imaging and sensing\" [63]. Pu et al. (2016) also published a similar review article on recent advances in semiconducting polymer nanoparticles in in-vivo molecular imaging [64], Even though these review articles are not exactly similar to what we are trying to address, the one published in 2018 by Li et al. is somewhat similar to the scope of our current review. Li et al. combined applications of SPN on imaging methods and phototherapy [65]. Having said that, our current review article will be focusing on SPN based emerging NPs only on the phototherapy. In particular, emerging and trending SPN systems in the very recent research papers and those published in the last five years will be discussed for their wide range of applications. \n\nThus, the present review will be focused on design, applications, and future scope of such SPN in detail. We believe that this review would enlighten readers to understand the advantages and limitations of SPN research so that they can come up with improved scientific solutions to solve such issues. We also highlight SPN and its future perspectives in the current review article.",

            "text": "Keywords: Semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs), Radiopharmaceuticals, Pancreatic cancer, Combined therapy, Radiotherapy, Photothermal therapy [26][27][28][29]. Compared with other inorganic nanomaterials such as gold nanorods and carbon nanotubes, SPNs possess unique characteristics such as better biocompatibility, higher NIR absorption and photothermal conversion efficiency, feasibility and controllability [30][31][32][33][34]. In particular, SPNs not only allow for convenient chemical engineering of backbones and side chains for on-demand functionalization, but also are conducive to nanoengineering to achieve size or morphology controllability [35]. To date, the utilization of SPNs for PTT has been fully explored, but combined therapy are rarely reported [10,36,37]. \n\nIn this study, we develop a 177 Lu-labeled semiconducting polymer nano-radiopharmaceutical with glucosedependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) as tumor targeting group ( 177 Lu-SPN-GIP) for combined RT and PTT of PDAC (Scheme 1a). 177 Lu-SPN-GIP was designed to comprise radioactive 177 Lu as a tracer for SPECT/ CT imaging and also as a killer for tumor with a SPN to serve for PTT treatment of cancer. Such combination of different treatment techniques could complement each other, offering accurate monitoring and comprehensive therapeutic effects relative to PTT or RT alone. This is a simple yet effective approach to fabricate SPNs-based multifunctional theranostic nanoplatform for treatment of pancreatic tumor.",

SPNs can produce stronger signal than commonly used single-wall carbon nanotubes and gold nanorods on a per mass basis, permitting whole-body lymph node PA mapping in living mice at a low systematic injection mass. Furthermore, SPNs possess high structural flexibility, narrow PA spectral profiles, and strong resistance to photodegradation and oxidation, which enables development of the first NIR ratiometric PA probe for in vivo real-time imaging of reactive oxygen species\u2014vital chemical mediators of many diseases.

They contribute significantly to the imaging process, traversing biological barriers and circulating before reaching their destinations. Enhancements involve conjugating cancerspecific antibodies to nanoparticles for improved tumor binding and detection [7]. Recent studies suggest nanoparticles and sensors can enhance cancer diagnostics and detection sensitivity. Diagnostic indicators include methylation patterns and mutation identification, while clinical diagnosis methods using circulating tumor cells, cell-free RNA, and extracellular vesicles require further investigation [7]. Stabilized by trimethoxysilane, (3-Mercaptopropyl) fluorescent gold nanoclusters and superparamagnetic ferrite are incorporated with polyethylene glycol dimethacrylate to create Fe 3 O 4 /GNCs nanoprobes on \"Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 nanoparticles\" [9]. Cancer-targeting antibodies exhibit enhanced infiltration into tumor cells with increased sensitivity when delivered via metallic nanoparticles, such as platinum, copper, silver, gold, and cobalt nanocomposites. These nanocomposites have demonstrated potential in cancer diagnostics and imaging, facilitating precise colon and breast cancer cell penetration and improved diagnostic signals. Because of their unique magnetic, chemical, and optical properties, nanoscale materials are employed to create imaging probes for positron emission tomography (PET), MRI, single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and ultrasound, offering enhanced sensitivity, temporal and spatial information, and improved control over biodistribution, contrast, functionality, and multimodal imaging. These advancements promise future clinical benefits, including real-time disease monitoring, personalized therapy, and early diagnosis.",

In a following study, the same author and coworkers [89] highlighted the feasibility of diketopyrrolopyrrole-(DPP-) based SPNs for in vivo PAI on a HeLa xenograft mouse model. After IV administration, DPP-SPNs exhibited a significantly higher PA signal in tumor than surrounding tissues, presumably due to extravasation of SPNs through cancer blood vessels. ese studies provided the first insights about the potential of SPNs for high-resolution PAI in oncological research.\n\nFurther improvements in biodistribution of amphiphilic polymers containing DPP-SPNs have been obtained through PEGylation [90], overcoming also the potential issue of their dissociation. In a proof of concept study, the ability of these amphiphilic SPNs for in vivo tumor imaging was demonstrated at 24 hours after IV injection.\n\nAttempts for advances in diagnostic specificity and sensitivity are also in progress through implementation of multispectral PAI. Zhang and colleagues [91] developed semiconducting polymer dots (Pdots), which include in their structure isoindigo (IID) and 4,7-dithien-2-yl-2,1,3benzothiadiazole (DTBT) as electron acceptors. is chemical modification, consisting in incorporation of an electron-deficient element into the SPNs structure, is known as the \"self-quenched process,",

Many applications require \ue104uorescence within a speci\ue103c range of wavelengths, selected for the relevant end-use. 2 Nanoparticles engineered for these applications must, therefore, have stable emission that does not change or quench in their intended environment over the period of storage and use. Unlike quantum dots, 3,4 SPNs have emission colors that do not shi\ue09d with the change in their size. [5][6][7] However, if a different emission color is required, the SPNs' parent polymer must be changed or a dopant molecule 8 or further polymer 9 must be introduced within the same nanoparticle during the synthesis process to facilitate inter-chain interactions that result in the required \ue104uorescence change. A key method for tuning the optical properties of SPNs is by preparing polymer blends prior to nanoparticle formation, resulting in what can be referred to as polyblend SPNs. 10 Several studies reported the synthesis of polyblend SPNs from a blend of two conjugated polymers; 11,12 Huebner et al. 12 reported the synthesis of PFO:POPPV SPNs from a blend of a blue emitting (PFO) and a green emitting (POPPV) polymer. The blending resulted in a material with controllable photoemission caused by the tunable energy transfer within the nanoparticles. This energy transfer was also reported by McNeill et al. 11 when blending F8BT with MEH-PPV. The blend caused the total quenching of F8BT emission and an increase in the optical quantum yield of the new MEH-PPV-emitting polyblend SPNs. Color control of polyblend SPNs could pave the way towards the production of white emitting nanoparticles from a blend of polymers with different emission colors, 13 while \ue104uorescence emission enhancement of pre-existing polymer nanoparticles by",

One elegant example is poly-(cyclopentadithiophene-alt-benzothiadiazole) (PCPDTBT) NPs, which were wrapped with activated fibroblast membranes to form AF-SPNs capable of multimodal cancer phototheranostics [15]. The use of activated fibroblast membranes is a unique and sophisticated approach to target homologous cancer-associated fibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment, which surround the tumor and produce extracellular matrix components and thus act as a physical barrier that impedes NP delivery deep within tumors [50]. To test the tumor-targeting ability of AF-SPNs in vivo, nude mice bearing 4T1 xenografts were IV injected with either AF-SPNs, unwrapped SPNs (uSPNs) or 4T1 murine breast cancer cell membrane-wrapped SPNs (CC-SPNs). At 48 h post IV injection, the maximal PA intensity enhancement (DPA) in the tumors of AF-SPN treated mice was 1.8-and 1.5-fold higher than that for uSPN and CC-SPN treated mice, respectively. These results were consistent with FL images in which the tumor FL intensity of AF-SPN treated mice was 1.5-and 1.3-fold higher than that of uSPN and CC-SPN injected mice, respectively. After tumors were exposed to 808 nm light (0.3 W/cm 2 , 5 min), the maximal tumor temperature was 50 \ufffd C for AF-SPN injected mice, which was 4.0 and 6.0 \ufffd C higher than that for CC-SPN and uSPN injected mice, respectively. Congruently, tumor volumes decreased to the greatest extent in mice that received irradiation plus AF-SPNs. Overall, this study confirmed that targeting activated fibroblasts with MWNPs is a promising approach to enhance cancer imaging and PTT.",

On the one hand, they construct a protecting physical barrier to impede tumor cells uptake of antitumor drugs. One the other hand, they secrete abundant growth factors and cytokines to activate correlative signaling pathways for promoting tumor angiogenesis, progression, initiation, metastasis, and resistance. Studies have shown that used cancer-associated fibroblast membrane coated nanoparticles to deliver therapeutic agents could target and kill cancer-associated fibroblasts, and depleted tumor-stroma biological interactions and in turn led to enhanced therapy (Ji et al., 2015(Ji et al., , 2016;;Li L. et al., 2018;Kovacs et al., 2020). Li et al. developed semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) coated with activated fibroblast membranes (denoted as AF-SPN) for enhanced multimodal cancer phototheranostics. In this study, uncoated SPN (uSPN) nanoparticles and the cancer cell membrane coated SPN (CCSPN) nanoparticles were as control group. To demonstrate the photodiagnostic potential of nanoparticles in vivo, different nanoparticles were intravenously injected into 4T1 tumor-bearing mice, and their NIR fluorescence and PA images were obtained. As shown in Figures 4A,B. AF-SPN facilitated homologous targeting ability, and allowed to specifically target cancer-associated fibroblasts. The experiment results demonstrated that AF-SPN provided higher accumulation in tumor tissues than both the uSPN and CC-SPN, and amplified NIR fluorescence and photoacoustic (PA) signals for tumor imaging (Li J. et al., 2018).",

Perfluorocarbon (PFC) are microbubble contrast agents, that showed great potential in ultrasound/PA based therapies and stimuli responsive drug delivery, when they were coupled with plasmonic nanoparticles [96]. Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) based polymeric nanoparticles and their derivatives were aided in tumor imaging with more than fivefold of the background signal at 2 h of the nanoparticle injection [87,97]. Benzothiadiazole moiety amplified the PA signal provided by the nanoparticles by twofolds [98]. Apart from imaging application for diagnosis, PA image guided photothermal/photodynamic therapy (PTT/PDT) was also achieved using semiconducting polymeric nanoparticles (Fig. 4) [97,99].",

Semiconducting conjugated polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) represent an emerging class of phototheranostic materials with great promise for cancer treatment. In this report, low-bandgap electron donor\u2013acceptor (D\u2013A)-conjugated SPNs with surface cloaked by red blood cell membrane (RBCM) are developed for highly effective photoacoustic imaging and photothermal therapy. The resulting RBCM-coated SPN (SPN@RBCM) displays remarkable near-infrared light absorption and good photostability, as well as high photothermal conversion efficiency for photoacoustic imaging and photothermal therapy. Particularly, due to the small size (<\u20095 nm), SPN@RBCM has the advantages of deep tumor penetration and rapid clearance from the body with no appreciable toxicity. The RBCM endows the SPNs with prolonged systematic circulation time, less reticuloendothelial system uptake and reduced immune-recognition, hence improving tumor accumulation after intravenous injection, which provides strong photoacoustic signals and exerts excellent photothermal therapeutic effects.

            "text": "Pu and coworkers reported NIR-absorbing semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) as an efficient and stable nanoplatform to generate ultrasound wave for in vivo photoacoustic molecular imaging [71] . Two polymer derivatives with strong absorption within the NIR region were chosen (Figure 4A-4C). These nanoparticles produced a stronger signal than the commonly used single-walled carbon nanotubes and gold nanorods, permitting whole-body lymph node photoacoustic mapping in living mice with low-volume injections (Figure 4D). Furthermore, they coupled the nanoparticles to a cyanine dye derivative (IR775S) that was sensitive to ROS-mediated oxidation to obtain a probe for ROS imaging. This example of ROS imaging demonstrated that the conjugated polymer nanoparticles possessed high structural flexibility and could be an ideal nanoplatform for photoacoustic molecular probes. The PA signal comes mainly from photothermal conversion. Thereby, the criterion for selecting PA imaging probes is consistent with that for PTT. This similarity makes PA and PTT an ideal pair to be seamlessly and synergistically combined into theranostics. Lyu and co-workers further confirmed that the PA intensity of SPNs was proportional to their photothermal conversion efficiency and thus envisioned the utility of SPNs in cancer treatment [72] . Recently, Fan et al demonstrated perylenediimide-based nanoparticles as highly efficient photoacoustic agents for deep brain tumor imaging [73] . \n\nCompared to single modality, MM imaging can satisfy the increasing requirements in advanced biotechnology. Sun and co-workers developed conjugated polymer-labeled magnetic nanoparticles using a layer-by-layer assembly technique for dual-modal fluorescent-magnetic resonance imaging [74,75] (Figure 5A and 5B). The fluorescent-magnetic nanoparticles were used for both tracking the cellular uptake of nanomaterials and controlling the cellular uptake by an external magnetic field. The results demonstrated a higher uptake ability of the fluorescence-labeled magnetic nanoparticles with the aid of a magnetic field.

Up to now, SPNs have been diversified for biological sensing, drug delivery, photoacoustic imaging (PAI), as well as photothermal and photodynamic therapy. SPNs are composed of organic constituents with low cytotoxicity and thus naturally overcome the long term toxicity issue caused by inorganic nanoparticles [6][7][8][9]. Despite the progress of SPNs in nanomedicine in recent years, fabrication techniques for SPNs with structurally stability and multi-functionality are still Ivyspring International Publisher in its infancy and confronted with great challenges. \n\nThe synthetic techniques for making semiconducting polymer nanoparticles are generally limited to emulsion technique and nanoprecipitation method [10][11][12][13]. However, these techniques offer poor control of SPNs size and produce SPNs with different particle size [14]. Furthermore, to afford SPNs with surface functional groups, amphiphilic polymer or phospholipid are required to encapsulate SPNs surface [15][16][17][18], which however are not inherently stable and suffer from the potential dissociation issues. To achieve structural stability, the synthesis and self-assembly of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) grafting SPNs have recently been reported [19,20]. However, the synthesis of semiconducting polymer amphiphiles is relatively complicated and the functionalization is specifically designed for each SPNs. Therefore, new strategies to develop SPNs with stable structure and controllable sizes are desired but still a challenge. \n\nRecently, multi-stimuli sensitive (e.g., pH changes, temperature, redox or light) nanoagents for controlled chemo/photothermal synergistic therapy have attracted considerable attention due to their additionally enhanced anticancer efficacy and reduced side effects.",

            "text": "Distinct from inorganic NPs like QDs and MNCs, SPNPs are mainly composed of optically active semiconducting polymers (SPs) and amphiphilic polymer matrixes (optional). Zhu et al. designed SPNPs with core SPs, middle silica layer, and outer PEG corona for enhancing the in vivo NIR fluorescence molecular imaging. Multilayered nanostructures not only allow the lymph nodes tracking but also allow for sensitive tumor imaging. [269,272] Chao et al. designed SPNPs via self-assembling from an amphiphilic semiconducting oligomer (ASO) for photoacoustic and fluorescence dual-modal imaging. The fluorescent intensity of tumor area increased gradually with time after tail vein injection of ASO, which suggests that ASO passively targeted to the tumor site by EPR effect. [270] he concept of biosensors was proposed in the 1960s, and comprehensively and deeply researched in the 1980s. [273] The nanofluorescent biosensor is a new analytical system that uses fluorescent nanomaterials as carriers with the fluorescent signal as the detection object. As we mentioned above, a wide variety of FNPs show the superior optical properties, such as bright fluorescence, high photostability, and excellent biocompatibility to be applied for the construction of fluorescent biosensor platforms. [15,274] For example, Shi et al. designed a nanomedicine, called \"sense-act-treat\" system, which combined a ratiometric pH sensor with therapeutic gold nanocage. This design could \"sense\" the tumor through two-state switching of fluorescence and further provide chemotherapy and hyperthermia for tumor treatment, showing the future potential application in cancer diagnosis and therapy. [275] Saranya et al. designed smart programmable nanoarchitectures based on AuNPs linking with Raman-active fluorophores through a peptide linker, Phe-Lys-Cys (FKC).",

            "text": "The data suggested that Ppa nanomodules were conducive to preoperative photoacoustic localization and intraoperative continuous AL imaging of tumors to guide resection (Fig. 4D). Light-triggered functional conversion from photoacoustic imaging to continuous AL imaging was achieved in two tumor models of murine breast cancer and peritoneal cancer in situ (Fig. 4E). As a marker of neutrophil infiltration and immunogenic cell death, ONOO \u00c0 detection by Ppa-FFGYSA nanomodules holds promise for clinical translational prospects of AL-assisted imaging. \n\nThe ultra-sensitive prospects of AL for in vivo imaging are limited by its dependence on inorganic carrier nanoparticles with difficult to modify surfaces, which may contribute to short NIR emission lifespan and relative dampening of signal contrast in target tissues [72][73][74]. A series of works by the Pu lab sought to address these issues using organic AL nanoconstructs. In 2017, the group fabricated organic <40 nm optically active semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) that demonstrated emission detection peaks at 780 nm that penetrated through living mouse tissue and had an emission half-life of about 6-7 min [75]. Dioxetane formation was intrinsically determined by substituent groups of the phenylenevinylene (PPV) polymer's vinyl bonds, and the PPV-SPNs could generate the necessary reactive 1 O 2 for AL emission following light irradiation. Incorporation of NIR-absorbing 1 O 2 sensitizer, NCBS5, facilitated recharged AL in deep tissue for longitudinal in vivo imaging. Thus, SPN-NCBS5 permitted rapid and highly sensitive lymph node and tumor imaging. Furthermore, by taking advantage of the structural versatility of SPNs, the authors developed smart biothiol-activatable NIR-AL probes (SPN-thiol) that could be activated by endogenous antioxidant biothiols present shortly after drug challenge in drug-induced hepatotoxicity. The SPN-thiols produced a SBR level that was 25-fold greater than NIR fluorescence (Fig. 5A).",

            "text": "Specifically, the nanoparticles primarily consisted of metals, carbon and organic polymer NPs. Current research on metal particles focuses particularly on synthesizing gold nanoparticles of diverse geometries, mainly comprising gold nanorods (AuNRs), gold nanospheres (AuNS), gold nanocages (AuNCs), and other shapes. Hollow gold nanostructures have also been particularly noted for their potential applications in drug delivery [70]. However, the toxicity of mental NPs cannot be ignored. Carbon nanomaterials have demonstrated superior performance over gold nanomaterials in terms of photostability, biocompatibility and toxicity, as well as fabrication [71]. Furthermore, the semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) were synthesized from bioinert materials. Pu et al. have proved that SPNs possessed high structural flexibility, narrow photoacoustic spectral profiles and strong resistance to photodegradation and oxidation, indicating that SPNs could be utilized as an ideal nanoplatform for developing photoacoustic molecular probes [72]. \n\nRecently, the activatable nanoprobes for PAI have been extensively explored in the PAI. Activatable nanoprobes are designed to be responsive only at sites of lesions, where they can be triggered by disease-specific small molecules or the unique microenvironment of the disease. Such activatable imaging probes significantly reduce background noise signal and enhance imaging sensitivity and specificity, which is particularly vital for accurate detection of minute lesions [73]. As we all know, the development of vascular tumors (e.g., hemangiomas) have a tight connection with proliferative changes of endothelial cells. In this phase, the GSH level, an important component in altering the oxidation-reduction status, is obviously increased. Therefore, developing active PAI probes based on GSH may assist to image specific vascular tumors [74]. Gong et al. conducted research using MnMoOX nanorods to track glutathione (GSH). This process involved reduction of Mo (VI) to Mo (V0), transforming nanorods to NPs and increasing PAI signal for tumor-specific imaging [75].",

            "text": "Understanding and imaging biological and pathological processes are important for early diagnosis and therapy. [1] However, chemical mediators in signal transduction [2] and diseases hallmarks [3] in pathological conditions are usually in low quantity and have sophisticated biological functions. The diversity and complexity of the microenvironment of living organisms create additional challenges to detect the target of interest. [4] Molecular probes have been widely used to detect biomarkers and molecular events in living organisms, which can be divided to \"always on\" and activatable probes. [5] \"Always on\" probes develop contrast signals through accumulation and they do not change signals upon interaction with the target of interest. [6] Distinct from inorganic nanoparticles such as quantum dots and gold nanoclusters, SPNs are composed of benign organic ingredients including hydrophobic SPs and amphiphilic polymer matrixes (optional). [22,23] SPNs thereby avoid the issue of heavy metal ion induced toxicity and have good biocompatibility. [24] Additionally, SPNs generally have higher absorption coefficients and better photostability compared to smallmolecule dyes. [25] This also stands when comparing SPNs with supramolecular nanoparticles, as they are generally assembled from small-molecule dyes. [26] Facile PEGylation (where PEG is polyethylene glycol) generally endows SPNs with good biodistribution, allowing them to act as whole-body imaging agents to detect the target of interest in living animals after systemic administration. [27] With all these advantages, SPNs have been widely used in cells imaging, [27a,d] activated cell sorting, [28] sensing of chemical mediators, [17b,c] tumor imaging [27e,29] hemodynamic imaging, [27g] and optogenetics. [30] There are some review articles summarizing the synthesis and applications of SPNs. [17d,22a,24a,31] This review focuses on the recent advances in the use of SPN-based activatable probes for sensing and molecular imaging. We discuss the chemistry of these organic nanoprobes in terms of different photonic imaging modalities along with their sensing and",

Alongside their applications in molecular electronics and photovoltaics, semiconducting polymers (SP) have in the last decade attracted attention for use in PAI. 6-9 Their extensive, highly delocalised \u03c0-conjugated backbones give SP a narrow band gap, facilitating photoexcitation and energy transfer and conferring excellent opto-electronic properties. Their organic composition also carries less potential for toxic degradation than their inorganic counterparts. The inherent hydrophobicity of SP allows them to be formulated into nanoparticles alongside oligomers and lipids, to form semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPN). These have large absorption coefficients, controllable sizes, adjustable absorption maxima, optical properties that are independent of particle size, and high photostability. The majority of reported SPN have been formed through the co-precipitation of lipids and SP, via either nano-precipitation 10 or mini-emulsion. 11 These techniques effectively encapsulate a waterinsoluble, conjugated polymer within a water-soluble, liposome-like construct. Amphiphilic SP can also undergo crystallisation-driven selfassembly in solution to form nanoparticles with a core-shell architecture, 12 and more recently microfluidic processing systems have been shown to enable large scale, high throughput production of uniform SPN. 13,14 Over the last decade, different SPN have been developed with a range of SP, liposomal formulations and PEGylation approaches, leading to nanoparticles with long in vivo lifetimes, good biodistribution profiles and maximum absorbance tuned to the NIR-I or NIR-II regions.",

            "text": "There were several attempts to construct PLNPs using organic materials with efficient afterglow luminescence. Pu's group reported semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) with red-shifted and enhanced NIR afterglow luminescence at 780 nm [20]. SPNs were prepared by nanoprecipitation of diverse semiconducting polymers(SPs) and PEG-b-PPG-b-PEG triblock copolymers (Fig. 5a). Among several SPs, phenylenevinylene(PPV)-based SPNs showed afterglow luminescence, since singlet oxygen generated by irradiation oxidized vinylene bonds of PPV, leading to unstable PPV-dioxetane intermediate emitting afterglow luminescence. In addition, for amplification and red-shift of afterglow luminescence, they doped a 1 O 2 sensitizer, silicon 2,3-naphthalocyanine bis(trihexylsilyloxide) (NCBS), into SPN-MEHPPV with the most intensive afterglow luminescence among PPVbased SPNs. SPN-NCBS showed amplified NIR afterglow emission at 780 nm. An 11-fold increase in afterglow luminescence was observed after pre-irradiation at 808 versus 514 nm. Based on these results, SPN-NCBS revealed a magnificent signal-to-background ratio (SBR) of 291, which is 67 times larger than that of NIR fluorescence in the detection of NIR signals through 1.5 cm thick chicken tissue. In addition, SPN-NCBS was effectively accumulated into lymph nodes and tumors in vivo and showed efficient afterglow luminescence only after 2 hours with a significant SBR of 149.7 in the tumor, 23.3fold higher than that of NIR fluorescence. The surface of SPN-NCBS was also modified with amphiphilic oligomer with quencher (C 18 PEG 12 -DNBS), resulting in selective cleavage in the presence of biothiols including cysteine and glutathione.",

By selecting polymers such as MEH-PPV, PFBT, and PFPV, they achieved highly bright and stable polymer dots suitable for high-resolution imaging.

            "text": "Most AIE systems with multiple functions (or modalities) are composed of several components through an all-in-one approach, suffering from defects in their complex molecular structure and multistep synthesis. \n\nOwing to poor photostability of traditional NIR organic dyes, organic semiconducting agents, including semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs), and semiconducting molecule nanoparticles (SMNs), have emerged as excellent candidates (Lyu et al., 2016;Pu et al., 2016;Zhu et al., 2016). These agents possess higher absorption coefficients, more tunable optical properties, and controllable dimensions compared with inorganic agents (Hong et al., 2012a;Pu et al., 2014a). The wavelength range 650-1,000 nm of NIR fluorescence imaging is known as the first NIR window (NIR-I), which can achieve a tissue penetration depth of up to \u22481 cm (Shanmugam et al., 2014). However, when NIR-I light passes through or interacts with the tissue, it still suffers from light scattering, tissue absorption, and autofluorescence (Ntziachristos, 2010), leading to a relatively poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and thus is less ideal for deep-tissue imaging. To enhance the imaging depth, the second near-infrared window (NIR-II, 1,000-1,700 nm), a more ideal region with deeper tissuepenetration depth and fewer light-tissue interactions, has been explored recently (Miao and Pu, 2018;Cai et al., 2019). To date, organic semiconducting agents have been utilized for deep-tissue imaging, including NIR-II fluorescence, self-luminescence, and PA imaging, in biomedical fields such as cell (Wu et al., 2010;Pu et al., 2014b), tumor (Wu et al., 2011b), acute edema (Pu et al., 2014b), and cardiovascular imaging (Hong et al., 2014) and in real-time evaluation of drug-toxicity (Shuhendler et al., 2014).",

            "text": "Semiconducting polymer NPs (SPNs) are attractive agents for PTT, PDT, or SDT due to their excellent optical properties, different from the traditional organic sensitizers with poor photostability. This included a significant absorption coefficient in the near-infrared region, high photostability, easy surface modification, adjustable size, and simple preparation processes [187,188]. Particularly, SPNs indicate a promising prospect in biomedicines due to the inexistence of toxic metal ions. In contrast, the limited penetration depths of light impose application-related restrictions [189]. Zeng et al. reported a US-triggered semiconducting polymer-based sensitizer (SPN Ab ) to exert an activatable sonodynamic-immunotherapy [46]. SPN Ab primarily comprises three components: the backbone of semiconducting polymer and PEG chains, 1 O 2 -cleavable linker, and anti-CTLA4 antibodies (Fig. 6A). The anti-CTLA4 antibodies on SPN Ab exhibit relatively low binding activities until a son-irradiation is provided under physiological conditions. The generated 1 O 2 induces ICD in tumors to promote adaptive immunity and cleaves the 1 O 2 -cleavable linkers to unleash anti-CTLA4 antibodies and trigger checkpoint blockades in situ. SPN Ab was studied and compared with the control nanoparticles SPN C , which was developed by conjugating PFODBT-N 3 with mPEG-alkyne. As shown in Fig. 6B, both SPN Ab and SPN C exhibited a spherical structure. The electron paramagnetic resonance (ESR) spectra of SPNs demonstrated evident characteristic peaks of 1 O 2 and hydroxyl radicals (\u2022OH) upon US irradiation, confirming the dominant ROS species (Fig. 6C and D). The 1 O 2 generation capability of SPN Ab and SPN C was also investigated, and FDA-approved sonosensitizer indocyanine green (ICG) and methylene blue (MB) were utilized as comparisons.",

The photo characteristics of SPN are mainly determined by the molecular structures of SPs. Such specific characteristics enable SPN to have rela-Polymers 2021, 13, 981 3 of 26 tively higher absorption coefficients and photo-stability compared to small molecular dyes and their self-assemblies [57]. Additionally, the organic and biologically inert nature of SPN reduces the risk of potential toxicity to living organisms, making it a perfect theranostic nanoagent for various photo-therapeutic strategies, including PTT, PDT, and their combined therapeutic strategy. \n\nSince these SPN based nanomaterials are a new class of functional nanoparticles (NPs), it is important to have an overall insight into what has been going on in very recent years. The application of such NPs in imaging guided photo-therapy has to be reviewed. Therefore, we focus on reviewing details on recent development about design, synthesis, and application of SPNs for anti-cancer research area. \n\nVarious novel polymeric structures have been designed through chemical functionalization via nanotechnology, which can improve its overall performance for phototherapy. In addition, such novel functionalized SPN have tunable optoelectronic properties improving photo-stability in terms of their fluorescence, chemiluminescence etc. In addition, such modified NPs have improved biocompatibility, and imaging capabilities either via photo-acoustic or NIR fluorescence imaging in in-vivo animal models [29,31,[58][59][60][61]. \n\nPreviously there were few similar review articles published, particularly for photo acoustic imaging (PAI) [62] by Zhou et al. (2018), whereas a review article by Chan et al. (2015) focused on \"semiconducting polymer nanoparticles as fluorescent probes for biological imaging and sensing\" [63].",

They reported the utilization of an inorganic shell formed by an organic photoelectric semiconductor polymer SPN core and manganese dioxide (MnO 2 ), followed by high NIR absorption of a conformational agent and photosensitizer poly-(cyclopentadithiene-o-benzothiazole) (PCPDTBT) encapsulated into the shell to form the core. In the acidic tumor microenvironment, MnO 2 in its outer shell reacts with H 2 O 2 to provide O 2 for PDT. Irradiating the tumor site with a specific wavelength, the photosensitizer transfers the energy to the surrounding oxygen, generating the highly active singlet oxygen. Singlet oxygen undergoes an oxidative reaction with nearby biomacromolecules, leading to cell damage (Figure 9b  and c).",

The polymer shell can then be functionalized; this process allows the linking of any number of biologically relevant molecules (oligopeptides, antibodies, and so forth) to the surface. These functionalized quantum dots have had applications in cellular imaging, 67,68 protein detection, 69 and cancer immunology. 70 Because of their unique charge-carrying abilities, QDots possess molar extinction coefficients 10 -50 times greater than typical organic dyes and are also up to 20 times brighter. 71 Additionally QDots have decreased rates of photobleaching, which lends them to being well-suited for biologic imaging. \n\nBy varying the semiconductor material contained within quantum dot nanoparticles, one can manipulate the wavelength that is emitted on excitation to skew emissions to the near-infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. This region is optimal for deep-tissue imaging due to the optical characteristics of biologic tissue. 3 ecently, a quantum dot fluorescent probe designed to target the epidermal growth factor receptor was evaluated for its ability to differentiate tumor cells from normal brain parenchyma in tumor biopsies of low-grade glioma. 72 In this study, quantum dots were conjugated to epidermal growth factor as well as monoclonal antibodies directed against the epidermal growth factor receptor and were evaluated for their ability to differentiate normal brain parenchyma from human glioma ex vivo (Fig 4). Tumor cells could be visualized from the macroscopic level, and this result indicated that quantum dot-targeted fluorescent probes could be used intraoperatively to assist in discerning tumor tissue from normal parenchyma in the resection of low-grade gliomas.",

This strategy is able to enhance the nonradiative heat generation, which can be used for PA signal amplification [148]. Pu et al. developed a fullerene doped semiconducting polymer nanoparticle (SPN-F) that can amplify the PA signal through the intraparticle photoinduced electron transfer [148]. As shown in Figure 13A, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) are -3.5 and -4.9 eV for semiconducting polymer and -4.3 and -6.5 eV for fullerene, respectively. Therefore, the semiconducting polymer and fullerene play their roles as electron donor and acceptor, respectively, leading to quenched fluorescence and enhanced nonradiative heat generation upon light irradiation, ultimately achieve amplified PAI signal. As shown in Figure 13B and C, with increasing amount of fullerene doped (SPN-Fx, x: the weight percentages of fullerene), the PA intensity obviously increased. The amplified PA signals of SPNs have also been demonstrated in vivo.

            "text": "Enzyme-mediated degradation of tumor ECM can enhance the accumulation of nanoparticles, thus amplifying PTT effect. For instance, Pu's group reported a semiconducting polymer nanoenzyme with NIR photothermally enzymatic activity for enhanced PTT of tumors [59]. The nanoenzymes were constructed by conjugating bromelain (Bro), a temperature-responsive enzyme onto the surface of semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) (Fig. 4a). SPNs acted as a photothermal nanotransducer to increase temperature under NIR laser irradiation. The enzymatic activity of nanoenzymes (PCB1-Bro) in the presence of NIR laser could be obviously improved, leading to degradation of collagen in tumor ECM, and more accumulation of nanoparticles in tumors (Fig. 4b,c). Thus, compared to PCB1, PCB1-Bro enabled better PTT efficacy and more efficient tumor inhibition in the 4T1 tumor-bearing mice (Fig. 4d). In addition to Bro, other enzymes have been used to synergize PTT through degrading the tumor ECM, achieving more effective tumor ablation in deeper tissues. In a recent study reported by Ping's group, a second NIR (NIR-II) light-activated nanosystem was fabricated for precise stromal-depletion and deep-tumor PTT therapy. Such nanosystem consisted of a gold-nanorod (AuNR) core coated by mesoporous polydopamine (mPDA) and papain (Pap), a natural protease that can degrade peptides loaded inside the mPDA [60]. Due to its high efficiency of photothermal conversion (56.5%) upon NIR-II laser irradiation, such AuNR@mPDA nanoparticles were able to activate thermophilic Pap to enable on-demand enzymatic depletion of tumor ECM.",

Images revealed 1.8\u00d7 PA signal enhancement for SPNs compared to the injection of control nanoparticles. The nanoconstruct also allowed for fluorescence imaging and PTT showing promising results as a carbon-based biocompatible theranostic platform.\n\nThe same year, Jiang described semiconducting polymer nanoparticles with absorption in both the biological windows in the NIR. 226 SPNs were built by nanoprecipitation of a mixture of poly[diketopyrrolopyrrole-alt-thiophene] and poly (diketopyrrolopyrrole-alt-thiadiazoloquinoxaline) with PEG-b-PPG-b-PEG as a stabilizer. The obtained SPNs displayed broad NIR absorption at 744 nm and 1253 nm, allowing for NIR dual-wavelength PA imaging for more accurate localization in living tissues. As a proof-of-concept, in vivo PA imaging of the rat brain vasculature was performed on a homemade PA system equipped with two lasers, at 750 nm and 1064 nm. PA signal remarkably increased at 750 nm after the intravenous injection of 300 \u00b5L of 6 mg mL \u22121 , but contrast at 1064 nm was 1.5 times stronger. These results demonstrate that SPNs can serve as a PA contrast agent in the second biological window of the electromagnetic spectrum, where high penetration depth can be achieved.\n\nTo sum up, semiconducting conjugated polymers offer the possibility to employ full-organic self-assembling materials for generating efficient PA contrast in vivo in a wide spectral range.

            "text": "Pu et al. prepared a semiconducting polymer nanococktail (SPN CT ) for imaging-guided PTT based on its temperature-dependent persistent luminescence intensity [91]. SPN CT was synthesized through the hydrophobic interaction between amphiphilic poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) grafted poly(phenylenevinylene) (PPV) and hydrophobic poly(silolodithiophene-alt-diketopyrrolopyrrole (PCSD) (Figure 16a). In SPN CT , PPV acted as the temperature-reporting probe to produce temperature-related persistent luminescence based on the thermodynamically controllable decomposition of dioxetane units in PPV. Meanwhile, PCSD within SPN CT absorbed the NIR light to generate heat for PTT (Figure 16a). Once intravenously injected, the distribution and accumulation of SPN CT in tumors were visualized via persistent luminescence imaging (Figure 16b). Under the irradiation of an NIR laser, PCSD produced heat to increase the temperature in tumors. Subsequently, the persistent luminescence of SPN CT was enhanced to report the photothermal temperature of the PTT process (Figure 16b). The SPN CT presented in this work achieved real-time temperature-monitoring PTT without the interference of tissue autofluorescence because real-time light excitation was not involved. In addition to organic semiconducting persistent luminescent molecules, inorganic persistent luminescent nanoparticles (PLNPs) have also been widely applied in bioimaging. Liu and coworkers modified hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) and phosphotungstic acid (PW12) molecules on the surface of ZGGO:Cr 3+ PLNPs and gold nanorods (GNRs) for the self-assembly of PLNPs and GNRs (Figure 16c) [92]. The resultant PLNP-GNR nanoplatform was able to monitor the temperature changes during PTT via autofluorescence-free bioimaging.",

            "text": "Early detection of cancerous cells is the topic of interest for applications of quantum dots. Multiplexing of quantum dots for the better targeting and sensitivity has been a candidate for this purpose. Surface receptors are available on cancer cells that can be targeted by the multiplxed nanoparticles. Antibody coated quantum dots that are specific to the surface markers on cancer cells were demonstrated to label them in mice. Currently, targeting tumours are based on such an approach that functionalizing quantum dots with molecules specific to the target. Since in vivo imaging requires high quantum efficiency of quantum dots to penetrate deep tissue and organs, its bioconjugation strategy should also be compatible to keep the initial brightness. In that regards, near IR emitting quantum dots are believed to be the optimal candidates for in vivo optical imaging. Infrared has the long wavelength that it can penetrate the deep tissues relatively better than other visible lights. It will also minimize the possible false positive signal by autofluorescence from the background since near IR is not relatively absorbed well by water or hemoglobin in the system. Gold nanoparticles have been the popular choice for near IR emitting nano fluorophores since it is relative biocompatible and easy to synthesize. (Lee, Cha et al. 2008;Shang, Yin et al. 2009) The surface plasmon resonance is dependent on the size of the nanoparticles that it moves towards red with increasing particle size. Other types of gold nanomaterials such as gold nanorods and gold nanoshells were also popularly used in bioimaging because of its tunable surface plasmon bands and controllable position of the resonance by varying the synthesis conditions. Several imaging methodologies were developed to be able to use gold nanoparticles and their derivatives in bioimaging. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) uses the scattering function of gold nanoshells for in vivo imaging. (Agrawal, Huang et al. 2006;Adler, Huang et al. 2008;Skrabalak, Chen et al. 2008) The accumulation of gold nanoshells at the tumour increases scattering at that location that provides the contrast. Another imaging tool for gold nanomaterials is using photoacoustic imaging. The photoacustic imaging adapts a pulse of near IR that causes",

            "text": "In the domain of protein detection, nanoparticles like Quantum dots (QDs), gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), and polymer dots (PDs) have emerged as invaluable assets. These nanoparticles find application in sandwich-type assays, enabling the detection of proteins by interacting with antibodies or aptamers. Among these, Quantum dot (QD) based biosensors stand out, owing to their distinctive optical characteristics, as they excel in detecting protein biomarkers such as neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Moreover, zinc oxide (ZnO) QD-based immunoassays exhibit remarkable promise in monitoring cancer treatment progress and predicting tumor recurrence. The synergy of QDs with various techniques, including staining and fluorescence, has substantially elevated the precision and sensitivity of protein biomarker detection. Active targeting of cancerous tissues in vivo is achieved through the use of peptides, such as the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif, facilitating precise tumor localization. Aptamers, which are single-stranded DNA or RNA sequences, contribute their high affinity and specificity to the arsenal of cancer detection tools. When conjugated with nanoparticles, aptamers form a potent platform for recognizing cancer cells, exemplified by the A10 RNA aptamerconjugated polymeric nanoparticles. Furthermore, upconverting nanophosphors (UCNPs) have emerged as promising luminous labels in biological contexts, significantly enhancing the detection sensitivity of cancer-related biomolecules (4).",

[58,59]his work was designed to showcase a modular way in which this postpolymerization methodology can be used to tailor SPNs for the desired application.Taking our in vivo targeting of zebrafish embryos as an example; further optimization of the PEG grafting and azide density could be performed to find that optimum balance of size, circulation efficiency, and tumor targeting, to ultimately achieve a much greater labeling efficiency.In addition, the azide-decorated SPNs could be applied to a variety of other applications in nanoparticle-based diagnostics and therapeutics, by simply switching out the alkynefunctionalized protein with other biomolecules (e.g., nucleic acids, peptides, sugars, etc.).Finally, for further in vivo applications in mouse models and beyond, it is often desirable for the SPN to absorb in the near-infrared window for deeper tissue penetrations.This could be achieved by switching the fluorene (F8) comonomer in F8BT-F to a more electron deficient monomer in order to lower the bandgap and shift the absorption into this window.",

Nanoparticles can be used as probes in in vivo imaging, biosensing, and immunostaining because of their unique physical and physiochemical properties. First of all, nanoparticles are small enough and can enter tumor microenvironment using an active transport mechanism through endothelial cells (Sindhwani et al. 2020). Secondly, they have relatively large surface areas to accommodate diverse probe molecules, increase the targeting affinity of individual probe, and are ideal for efficient modification with a variety of targeting and imaging moieties. Thirdly, they exhibit high sensitivity. Many nanoparticles show unique magnetic, optical properties and enable multivalent targeting to one or more biomarkers. Lastly, they can also be engineered as suitable platforms for tumor therapy and diagnosis by prolonging half-lives, enhancing stability, and improving targeting efficiency (Baetke et al. 2015;Chen et al. 2013;Lee et al. 2010). The well-investigated nanoparticles include magnetic nanoparticles, quantum dots, gold nanoparticles, polymeric nanoparticles, upconversion nanoparticles, carbon nanoparticles, silicon nanoparticles, and many others. \n\nSelected peptides have been conjugated to nanoparticles and extensively used to cancer imaging. Carbon nanoparticles have shown potential as contrast agents for photoacoustic imaging of tumors because they offer high spatial resolution and allow deep tissue imaging. Gambhir's group fabricated single-walled carbon nanotubes conjugated with cyclic RGD peptides as targeting contrast agents for noninvasive cancer imaging and allowed the visualization of multiple molecular processes in living subjects (de la Zerda et al. 2012). Polymer nanoparticles possess excellent optical properties, high structural flexibility and photostability, and are considered as good near-infrared photoacoustic probes for in vivo real-time imaging of many diseases (Li et al. 2018).",

            "text": "Fluorescent nanomaterials, including quantum dots and fluorescent nanoparticles, are extensively utilized in the fluorescence imaging of colorectal cancer due to their high fluorescence quantum yield and stable optical properties [149]. Through surface modifications, these nanomaterials can specifically bind to tumor cells, either on their surface or within, enabling precise tumor labeling and imaging [219]. \n\nThe unique structure of quantum dots confines electron movement in all three dimensions, resulting in the quantum confinement effect [220]. Quantum dots feature a broad excitation spectrum and a narrow, symmetric emission spectrum, enabling excitation by a single light source to produce emissions at multiple wavelengths [221]. This sharp, high-resolution emission spectrum facilitates easy detection and differentiation in complex biological samples. Additionally, quantum dots exhibit a high fluorescence quantum yield and intense luminescence, generating strong fluorescence signals even at low concentrations, thereby enhancing imaging sensitivity [222]. Their excellent photostability surpasses that of traditional organic fluorescent dyes, as they are resistant to photobleaching under prolonged illumination. This stability ensures consistent and accurate imaging over time [223]. Yang et al. [224] developed an Ag 2 Se quantum dot (Figure 3B) with remarkable stability and fluorescence continuity in gastric acid, enabling long-term monitoring of intestinal peristalsis. Compared to conventional barium meals, these quantum dots provided clearer intestinal imaging with superior biocompatibility. \n\nFluorescent nanoparticles encompass a wide range of types, including carbon fluorescent nanoparticles and polymer fluorescent nanoparticles [225,226]. In intestinal endoscopy, the diagnosis of malignant lesions using white-light endoscopy depends heavily on the operator's skill and experience, and early-stage malignant lesions-such as those seen in Lynch syndrome-are often missed. This issue is exacerbated when lesions are hidden behind mucosal folds or are undetectable by standard endoscopy, making early detection challenging. While local staining could improve diagnostic accuracy, it is cumbersome and time-consuming, highlighting the need for better solutions [227]. Silica fluorescent nanoparticles offer several advantages, including good biocompatibility, ease of surface modification, and high stability [228].",

            "text": "\u2022 The RBCM endows SPN with good biocompatibility, prolonged blood circulation, and improved tumor accumulation, while the small size structure endows SPN with deep tumor penetration and rapid clearance from body. Theranostic nanoplatforms simultaneously bearing diagnostic and therapeutic functions through a single entity are crucial for detecting diseases at an early stage and realizing image-guided therapies, which is favored to improve the survival rate of cancer patients [1,2]. Recently, phototheranostic nanoagents utilizing light to collect diagnostic information and achieve therapeutic effects have gained intensive attention due to their noninvasiveness, high efficiency, and convenient maneuverability in a spatial and temporal manner [3,4]. Among the numerous phototheranostic strategies, photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and photothermal therapy (PTT) can seamlessly and synergistically match each other, because the efficacies of both PAI and PTT are mainly dependent on photothermal conversion ability, considering that PAI uses photothermally converted acoustic waves to realize ultrasound signal detection [5][6][7][8]. PAI can overcome the traditional optical penetration limitations (e.g., fluorescence imaging) since it detects phonons rather than photons under light excitation, providing superior spatial resolution, high contrast, and deep tissue penetration [7,[9][10][11]. To date, various optical agents have been developed for PAI/PTT theranostics, including small molecule dyes, metallic nanoparticles, and carbon nanomaterials [12][13][14][15][16]. Nevertheless, small molecule dyes usually suffer from photobleaching, while metallic nanoparticles encounter severe biotoxicity and carbon nanomaterials have broad PAI spectra without a specific wavelength and a low extinction coefficient for PAI and PTT [17,18]. Semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) characterized by \u03c0-\u03c0 electron delocalized backbones and easy exciton diffusion along the backbone represent a new PAI/PTT agent with good photostability, high extinction coefficient, and excellent photothermal conversion efficiency [1,5].",

Nanoparticles (NPs): Nano particle forms the core of nanobiomaterial [15].Nanoparticles are small spheres of size ranging from 10-1000nm. Nanoparticles are of various types depending upon the nature of material used, for instance, polymeric, gold, superparamagnetic etc. Polymeric nanoparticles are composed of different biodegradable polymers like PLGA, chitosan, sodium alginate etc and are used massively for diagnostic purposes. Modified polymeric nanoparticles are used as contrast agents in Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Computed Tomography etc [7]. Metallic nanoparticles are used in biosensors and in drug delivery, especially in treatment of cancer [1].Superparamagnetic nanoparticles are prepared from magnetic materials like nickel, iron, cobalt etc. that basically comprises of iron oxide core with polymer coating [7]. Metal NPs are made of the metals precursors.Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) consist of a thin gold shell which surrounds a dielectric core known as nanoshell [7]. Ceramics NPs are inorganic, nonmetallic solids. These nanoparticles have important application in catalysis, photocatalysis, photodegradation of dyes and imaging applications. Semiconductor materials possess properties between metals and nonmetals and therefore they found various applications due to this property [16]. \n\nNanoparticles can be used to increase the bioavailability of various natural compounds [23]. \n\nQuantum Dots (QDs): These are 2-10 nm sized semiconductor nanocrystals. They have quantum confinement properties. QDs emit stable fluorescence from visible to infrared region when it gets excited by light. QDs are composed of positive charged holes and negative charged carriers (electrons). The mechanism of fluorescence is based on the fact that when light of higher energy falls on it, new charged carriers are formed.",

            "text": "Sonosensitizers inherently require an adequate supply of oxygen to generate sufficient ROS, but the interior hypovascular solid tumors often encounter hypoxia and thus inevitably decrease the therapeutic efficacy of SDT. [11] ncorporation of in situ oxygen-generating materials such as enzymes [11a] or oxygen carriers such as hemoglobin [11b] and perfluorocarbon [12] into sonosensitizers to increase tumor oxygenation is a regulatory strategy to reduce the tolerance of hypoxic tumors to SDT. However, the penetration ability of sonosensitizers in solid tumors has rarely been evaluated. Especially in large solid tumors with hypopermeable characteristics, the penetration ability of sonosensitizers is a vital factor, since the ROS generated by sonosensitizers only induce nearby tumor cell apoptosis. [13] herefore, a new sonodynamic therapeutic system is urgently needed to synergistically enhance tumor penetration and alleviate tumor hypoxia in a large tumor model. \n\nAs an emerging category of organic theranostic agents, semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) transformed from highly -electron delocalized semiconducting polymers have high biocompatibility, high chemical flexibility, and tunable sizes. [14] To date, SPNs have been explored for a series of biomedical applications including optical imaging, [15] phototherapy, [16] and biological regulation. [17] However, the sonodynamic therapeutic effect of SPNs as sonosensitizers for cancer therapy has yet to be exploited. \n\nIn this study, we report the synthesis of US excitable semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (termed as SPNC) that can synergistically overcome both poor penetration and hypoxia in large solid tumors for enhanced SDT. SPNC is composed of a semiconducting polymer nanoparticle core as a sonodynamic converter, conjugated with an oxygen-modulating enzyme, catalase, via a coupling reaction between the amino group of catalase and the carboxyl group of SPN (Figure 1a).",

Numerous research have indicated the great prospect of the folic acid-based polymeric nanoagents for diagnosing cancer by delivering 5-ALA, such as oral cancer (Yang et al., 2013), cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) (Xu et al., 2021), prostate cancer (Casas, 2020) and glioblastoma (Babic et al., 2018). \n\nSemiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) are also identified as excellent optical agents and applied for fluorescence, chemiluminescent, and photoacoustic (PA) imaging for the early detection of cancer due to the excellent biocompatibility and structural versatility (Cui et al., 2020;Tang et al., 2022). Poly (p-phenylenevinylene) (PPV)-based SPNs could emit afterglow luminescence after removing light excitation. Hence, the tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP) photosensitizer-copolymerized PPVs SPNs are synthesized to function as near-infrared (NIR) afterglow nanoagents. The novel copolymer nanoagents produce red-shifted NIR luminescence and amplified afterglow signals, allowing the in vivo tiny cancer imaging via sensing low oxygen in the cancer microenvironment (Cui et al., 2018). In general, cancer-associated fibroblasts are recognized as the key barriers for cancer therapy. Thereby, activated fibroblasts (AF)-camouflaged SPNs (AF-SPNs) are emerged as effective biomimetic nanoagents for optimizing cancer phototheranostics, where a SPN and AF membrane serve as the core and shell, respectively (Li et al., 2018). The AF-SPNs would generate stronger PA signal and dramatically strengthen photodiagnostic efficacy (Li et al., 2018).",

            "text": "In summary, we developed a peptide-based osteosarcoma-targeted SPNs (SPN-PT) for dual-modal imaging (NIR-II fluorescence/NIR-I PA) guided phototherapies (PTT/PDT). The peptide was incorporated into amphiphilic copolymer (DSPE-PEG 2000 -COOH) to provide water solubility for biocompatible applications. The NIRabsorbing semiconducting polymer (PCPDTBT) was used as the source of NIR-II fluorescence and PA signals, and served as the PS for PTT and PDT. SPN-PT was formulated through nanoprecipitation method with a size of about 124 nm. The feasibility and efficiency of SPN-PT as PS has been investigated in detail, in terms of physiochemical characters, PTT and PDT performance, and preliminary cell-based studies and in vivo therapies. In particular, the cellular uptake of the peptide driven nanoparticles into targeted OS cells is far more rapid than control, which can be finished within 4 h. Collectively, due to the peptide-based targeting ability, SPN-PT demonstrated selective and efficient OS cellular uptake and boosted strong NIR-II fluorescence and PA signals offering high-sensitivity and high-resolution images for OS tumors. Simultaneously, the enhanced cell accumulation contributed to effective intratumor distributed phototherapies. Our study predicts a promising peptide-based theranostic platform for OS early diagnosis and precise therapies. Besides semiconducting polymers, other kinds of fluorophores can also be encapsulated into nanoplatforms for different imaging modalities such as NIR-II PA imaging. In addition, anticancer drugs may be loaded into the nanoparticles to endow the SPNs with chemo/ photo combination therapy to further promote the therapeutic efficacy.",

            "text": "After the injection, is required a tool to detect the actual biodistribution of the nanoparticles. \n\nIn this context, imaging is one of the most exploited techniques in order to find out the path of nanoparticles following injection into the bloodstream. \n\nTo ensure that nanoparticles effectively reach their planned target, such as a tumor, and to assess their interaction with the immune system, precise tracking and characterization methods are essential. Ma and coworkers have synthesized nanoparticles based on tetraphenylethylene and NIPAM, designed as lysosome-specific fluorescent probes for bioimaging, demonstrating low cytotoxicity, high specificity and excellent resistance to photobleaching. [156] One straightforward method for tracking nanoparticles is labelling them with radioactive tracers. [157] his approach allows for detection using imaging techniques such as scintigraphy, which provides information on the distribution and localization of the nanoparticles within the body. Additionally, recent advancements in imaging have significantly benefited from the development of quantum dots, representing cutting-edge nanotechnology that offers superior imaging capabilities compared to traditional organic dyes. The stability of quantum dots is attributed to their inorganic nature, which prevents the rapid degradation seen with organic dyes. Nanoscale quantum dots, typically ranging from 2 to 50 nm in diameter, emit light that changes from blue to red as their size increases. This size-dependent emission allows for multiplexing in imaging studies, where multiple quantum dots with different emission wavelengths can be used simultaneously to track various nanoparticles or biological processes. [158] Quantum dots photostability further enhances their utility in vivo imaging studies as they can remain fluorescent for months, providing continuous and reliable tracking of nanoparticles over extended periods. In particular, it has developed and produced a new class of thermo-responsive semiconducting polymer nanoparticles designed for high-contrast photoacoustic imaging of tumors. These advanced agents are built from semiconducting polymer brushes featuring poly(N,N-dimethylacrylamide)-r-(hydroxypropyl acrylate) (PDMA-r-HPA) grafts. [159]",

In comparison, photoacoustic (PA) imaging allows imaging beyond the optical diffusion limit by integrating optical excitation with ultrasonic detection based on the PA effect, providing deeper tissue imaging penetration and higher spatial resolution. 9,10,11 Herein we report that near-infrared (NIR) light absorbing semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) can serve as an efficient and stable nanoplatform to allow photons to be used to generate ultrasound (US) waves, permitting in vivo PA molecular imaging.\n\nWhile endogenous molecules (i.e. hemoglobin, melanin) can generate PA contrast, many physiological and pathological processes often elicit little variation in these intrinsic PA signals, and thus it is essential to develop exogenous contrast agents for PA imaging in living subjects. 12 Many materials have been applied as effective PA contrast agents, including small-molecule dyes, metallic nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes and porphysomes.

            "text": "In the last three decades, there has been a rapid increase in the use of new nanomaterials and radionuclides to enhance cancer diagnosis and therapies [2,79]. Many organic and inorganic materials can be used as nanoparticles [58,80,81]. Nanoparticle (NP) delivery systems have enhanced imaging and therapeutic efficacy by targeting the delivery of radio-labeled drugs to the tumor site and reducing their toxic side effects [79,81,82]. The significant advantages of nanoparticles are that they can be prepared in sizes <100 nm. This increases the localization of the drugs and radionuclides and the permeability and retention (EPR) effect of passive targeting tumor cells and facilitates uptake by active targeting tumor cells [81,82]. The surface of nanomaterials is usually coated with polymers or ligands to improve biocompatibility and the selection of specific targets [80]. A nanomaterial's final size and structure depend on the salt concentrations, surfactant additives, reactant concentrations, reaction temperatures, and solvent conditions used during synthesis [79,80]. Two mechanisms of nanoparticle delivery system for diagnostics and therapy to tumor sites are (i) specific passive targeting cells and (ii) specific active targeting cells [81,82]. \n\nNanotargeted radionuclides have three main components, the nanoparticle core, the targeting biomolecule (which must be able to recognize a specific biological target), and the radionuclide [80]. Nanoparticles drug delivery systems can be made from polymers (polymeric nanoparticles, micelles, or dendrimers), lipids (liposomes), viruses (viral nanoparticles), organometallic compounds (nanotubes), inorganic nanoparticles (fullerenes, carbon nanotubes, quantum dots, or magnetic nanoparticles) [47,[80][81][82]. The physical and chemical properties of nanoparticles play a critical role in determining particle-cell interactions, cellular trafficking mechanisms, biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, and optical properties [80].",

            "text": "Typical luminescent nanomaterials include quantum dots (Qdots) [23], carbon dots [24], upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) [25], aggregationinduced emission (AIE) dots [26] and polymer dots (Pdots) [27]. In particular, Pdots have demonstrated the utilization of optical and biosensing applications in recent years, such as super-resolution imaging [28,29], fluorescence imaging [30,31] and disease-related marker detection [32,33]. Pdots are organic nanoparticles assembled from polymer chains with \u03c0-conjugated systems, and the nanoscale size endows Pdots with unique properties, which have attracted extensive attention. According to the definition given by Wu and Chiu [34], the Pdots, specifically considered as a part of semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs), are nanoparticles consisting of hydrophobic semiconducting polymers with a volume or weight fraction more than 50% and a diameter generally less than 50 nm, sometimes the particles size can be less than 30 nm. Pdots have shown characteristics of large absorption cross section, high brightness, good photostability, low toxicity and various forms of existence and modification, which are the basis of fluorescence probes for complex biological applications, typically for fluorescence-based biosensing and bioimaging [35][36][37]. \n\nThis review focuses on the fundamental content and recent advances of Pdots in biosensing and bioimaging applications. The preparation and properties of Pdots are briefly introduced. Modification and functionalization are basic and crucial parts of practical applications, which are related to the attachment of functional groups to the surface of nanoparticles. Thus, several surface modification methods are also introduced.",

            "text": "In recent years, nanomaterials with size of 1-100 nm have developed rapidly in the field of biomedicine [1]. There are many types of nanoparticles, including quantum dots (QDs) [2][3][4], silicon nanoparticles [5,6], metal nanoclusters [7], etc. Quantum dots are a semiconductor material [8] whose internal electrons are restricted in all directions, resulting in a discontinuous electronic-energy-level structure. Quantum dots demonstrate characteristics of wide absorption range, narrow emission peak width, and excellent photostability and brightness [9]. However, the inherent heavy metal toxicity and complex preparation methods of quantum dots greatly limit the further application of these nanomaterials in in vivo imaging and clinical translation. To solve these limitations, various types of nanomaterials were developed, including semiconducting polymer dots (Pdots). Pdots are nanoparticles formed with semiconducting polymers by methods such as nanoprecipitation or microemulsion. Semiconducting polymers are macromolecular compounds with large \u03c0-conjugated backbones and delocalized electronic structures [10]. Since Pdots have a conjugated framework and a large number of \u03c0-\u03c0 bonds, Pdots have strong light-harvesting ability, high fluorescence quantum yield, and easy electron and energy transfer in the conjugated framework [11]. Pdots also have the characteristics of excellent photostability, structural diversity, functional designability, and easy surface modification [12]. These outstanding properties ensured that Pdots could be widely used in the biomedical field, including bioimaging, biosensors, tumor therapy, etc. For instance, Day et al. synthesized a multimodal combination of Pdots containing a heat shock protein inhibitor and azo compound for triple-negative breast cancer [13].Wu et al. designed a silica nanoparticle coated with catalase to treat glioblastoma through chemodynamic therapy and sound dynamic therapy [6]. Deng et al. synthesized a manganese-loaded fluoride nanoparticle for MRI and chemodynamic treatment of tumors [14].",

            "text": "This enabled tumor ablation via NIR light-activation [155]. Both groups hypothesized that the 2D geometries of nanosheets are well suited to take advantage of the experimentally observed enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect of growing tumors. Photoacoustics and fluorescence were both used to measure nanosensor activation. Dose-dependent curves show continuous monitoring demonstrating that higher lithium concentrations yielded stronger signal. This also revealed that peak lithium was achieved at 18 min. Adapted with permission from [127], copyright 2015 American Chemical Society. \n\nOrganic carriers can also be useful in PTT for their biocompatibility and capacity for drug loading. Porphysomes have passive tumor targeting and PA signal while also being photothermally active [130,154]. Some polymer carriers have been combined with inorganic components: gold-nanoshelled microcapsules, for example, consist of poly-lactic acid cores coated with gold nanoparticles to impart both photoacoustic and photothermal functionality with drug-loading capabilities. Recently, semiconducting polymer nanoparticles, engineered at the molecular orbital level to favor photoinduced electron transfer, were shown to localize in tumors while increasing photoacoustic signal and PTT efficiency [119]. \n\nIn 2017, the temperature responsive polymer poly(N-isospropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM), was loaded with photothermally active gold nanorods to achieve sensitive PA monitoring of photothermal therapy [156]. PNIPAM shrinks when heated, allowing the gold nanorods to approach one another and shift their NIR absorbance (and PA signal) via plasmonic coupling (Figure 7). These dynamic constructs were used to selectively monitor photothermal activation in murine prostate tumors while negating background from blood. Overall, these advances in PTT demonstrate practical ways that PAI can be leveraged with synergistic contrast agents to both deliver and monitor drugs in real time.",

            "text": "Polymeric nanoparticles (PNPs) have found application in drug delivery due to their high biocompatibility and their ability to encapsulate and protect in their interiors drugs, dyes, proteins, etc. 154 In photoacoustic imaging, the most popular polymeric structures contain either conjugated polymers (CPs) or porphyrin-related units capable of directly interacting with NIR light thanks to their elevated \u03c0-conjugation spread throughout the whole polymer chains. 155 CPs are often referred to as semiconducting polymers (SPs), since their incredibly high conjugation degrees cause the formation of band structures and a massive shrinking in the gap between the \u03c0 and \u03c0* bands, which resembles the features of most inorganic semiconductors. 156 By means of microemulsion or nanoprecipitation, CPs are able to self-assemble into nanostructures which are stable and well dispersible in water, known as conjugated polymer nanoparticles (CPNs) or semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs). Although their extinction coefficients are still lower than the ones of AuNPs and their absorption peak is broad, their high photostability and chemical versatility allow for both specific targeting and attachment of therapeutic moieties. CPs are macromolecules with a conjugated \u03c0-system spread throughout the polymeric backbone, and the polymers are densely packed to form nanoparticles with much stronger extinction coefficient and higher photostability compared with small molecule dyes. Optical properties, strictly connected to the polymeric core, can be tuned via modification of the polymeric backbone, combination of different polymers and control over aggregation and surface functionalization. [157][158][159][160] Because this class of contrast agents is still relatively young, detailed biocompatibility studies aimed at showing their potential for preclinical photoacoustic imaging still need to be conducted. [161][162][163][164][165][166][167] Principally, semiconducting polymers employed for PA imaging are composed of diketopyrrolopyrrole, phenothiazine, cyclopentadithiophene, fluorene, pyrrole or thio",

            "text": "Although improved theranostic efficacy has been achieved by a cell membrane camouflaging strategy, other bottlenecks still exist that cause the poor performance of nanoparticles in solid tumor treatment. It has been realized that nanobased therapeutics mainly deliver particles to the cells on the tumor periphery, owing to the dense interstitial structure of the tumor that impedes the penetration of external nanoparticles to reach a therapeutic dose [36][37][38]. Moreover, to avoid potential long-term toxicity, the theranostic agents should be biodegradable or clearable within an appropriate period for clinical applications. In particular, the size of nanoparticle has a great influence on the toxicity and clearance characteristics [39][40][41]. For example, small-sized nanoparticles (less than 30 nm) have been proven to exhibit deep tumor penetration [42][43][44]. Meanwhile, it is also well known that ultrasmall-sized nanoparticles possess renal clearance characteristics, such as gold nanoparticles, black phosphorus quantum dots, porphyrin-PEG polymers, and metal/covalent-organic framework nanodots [39,41,[45][46][47]. Thus, elaborately designed nanoparticles with a reasonable size and appropriate surface decoration can balance the demands between body clearance and tumor accumulation. \n\nHerein, we synthesized a novel narrow bandgap donor-acceptor (D-A) conjugated polymer with thiophenefused benzodifurandione-based oligo(p-phenylene vinylene) as the acceptor segment and thieno [3,2-b]thiophen-2-yl) benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b\u2032]dithiophene as the donor segment, to serve as building blocks to construct SPNs for cancer phototheranostics (Scheme 1).

            "text": "In summary, we have prepared a novel phototheranostic platform based on D-A semiconducting polymer nanoparticle (SPN) with surface camouflaged by red blood cell membrane (RBCM) for NIR photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and photothermal therapy (PTT). The as-prepared SPN@ RBCM nanoparticles display excellent NIR absorbance, high photothermal conversion ability, and good photothermal stability. Moreover, inherited from the natural features of the sourced red blood cells, the SPN@RBCM nanoparticles possess excellent performance of the enhanced biocompatibility, reduced retention in the reticuloendothelial system, prolonged blood circulation, and the improved tumor accumulation. On the other hand, the SPN@RBCM has small size (< 5 nm), which not only shows deep penetration in tumor site, but also can be easily cleared out from the body to overcome the long-term toxicity induced by the undefined residues after systemic administration. Therefore, as-prepared SPN@RBCM could act as an optimal phototheranostic nanoagent to provide intensified PA signals for tumor imaging and enhanced photothermal killing effects for cancer treatment. Given these outstanding characteristics, this nanoplatform might be a promising phototheranostic agent for clinical translation in future.

            "text": "For example, croconaine-loaded NPs, which were reported by Li et al., have shown high contrast in PAI, enabling a real time monitoring of NPs accumulation within the tumor [115]. Furthermore, the authors used croconaines with different adsorption wavelength to compare the accumulation of targeted and untargeted NPs; the irradiation of the particles with the 808 nm laser set at 1.0 W determined a photothermal conversion of 30  C upon irradiation with 0.8 W/cm 2 for 5 min at 808 nm. The system was encapsulated within cancer cell membrane to improve the targeting to the tumor tissue upon intravenous administration [117]. Semiconducting polymeric NPs are characterized by a photoactivable semiconducting polymeric core, which allows PTT, as well as PA or fluorescent imaging of tumors [118]. \n\nThe main advantage of semiconducting polymeric NPs over other organic NPs for PTT is the presence of the photoactivator in the polymer, which is then precipitated into particles, compared to the loading of a molecule like indocyanine. Furthermore, the structure of the semiconducting polymeric NPs can be easily engineered in the backbone to introduce donor-acceptors to shift the absorption from NIR I to NIR II window, with enhanced efficacy vs. lower fluence of the laser and higher safety of the treatment [109,118]. Duan et al. recently reported a modification of two isoindigo-based semiconducting polymeric NPs (identified as PBFT-DIID) to present a strong absorption between 700 and 1000 nm, correlated with a photothermal conversion efficiency of 70.6%, with a concentration dependent increase in the temperature up to 60 \u2022 within 5 min of laser irradiation at 0.5 W/cm 2 , and stable photoactivation in 5 repeated irradiation cycles, correlated with a complete tumor eradication in 4T1 subcutaneous tumor model after 6 min exposure to 0.8 W/cm 2 over the tumor area [119]. Organic nanosystems present lower toxicity compared to the inorganic ones.",

            "text": "Currently, with morphological investigation of tissues or cells and with the help of imaging tools, early cancer can be diagnosed. Most imaging techniques, such as X-rays, MRIs, computed tomography (CT), endoscopies, and ultrasounds, can only detect cancer when the tissue has undergone a conspicuous change [47]. Although nanotechnology has not yet been used in clinical settings to diagnose cancer, it is presently available in a number of medical screenings and testing [48]. Nanoparticles are used to collect cancer biomarkers for cancer detection, including cancer-associated proteins, circulating tumour DNA, circulating tumour cells, and exosomes [49]. Promising nanotechnology diagnostic techniques are being created to provide on-demand, practical, and affordable cancer detection and diagnosis tools. As a result of their superior volume-to-surface ratio when compared to bulk materials, many nanotechnologies, including quantum dots, gold nanoparticles, magnetic nanoparticles, and polymer dots, are used for cancer detection. This property enables the dense coating of antibodies, small molecules, peptides, aptamers, and other substances on nanoparticle surfaces. Such compounds can bind to and identify particular cancer molecules [47].",

Based on the size and shape of the gold nanoparticles, the scattering properties of the gold nanoparticles are also changed [29]. The light scattered by the gold nanoparticles have greater photostability than the other imaging agents commonly used [29]. Gold nanorods exhibit a phenomenon called the Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS), which is also used in cancer diagnosis. In addition, gold nanoshells and gold nanorods have been used to induce photothermal therapy [29]. This is an example for a \"theragnostic\" agent, as the gold nanorods not only assist in diagnosis of the cancer, but also help in ablation.",

Additionally, they are important for some imaging functions. It has been found that nanoparticles remain in the blood circulation for a long period of time before reaching the target cells, where they traverse many biological walls such as cell membranes and interact with biological systems (Figure 2). Moreover, cancer-specific antibodies can be conjugated with nanoparticles for better cancer binding and detection. Many recent studies have demonstrated that nanoparticles and sensors have significant potential for increasing the sensitivity of tumor detection and improving cancer diagnosis [13]. It has been reported that the detection of methylation patterns and mutations has been used as a marker for cancer diagnosis. It has been suggested that more studies are required before using extracellular vesicles, circulating tumor cells, and cell-free RNA in clinical diagnosis [14]. Researchers have used fluorescent gold nanoclusters (GNCs) or superparamagnetic (Fe 3 O 4 /GNCs), (\u03b3-Mercaptopropyl) trimethoxysilane (MPS) as a stabilizing agent. The prepared GNCs@MPS was conjugated on the surface of \"Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 nanoparticles\" followed by the addition of \"poly ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (PGD)\" to form Fe 3 O 4 /GNCs nanoprobes. It has been found that (Fe 3 O 4 /GNCs/Aptamer) is capable of uptake in HL60 cancer cells [15]. Various metallic nanoparticles have shown better sensitivity in detecting tumor cells as they can be conjugated with cancer-specific antibodies and penetrate cancer cells more effectively. Studies have reported that nanocomposites containing more than one type of nanoparticle, such as gold, platinum, silver, copper, and cobalt, are better candidates for cancer detection and imaging.",

            "text": "The therapeutic efficacy of photodynamic therapy is limited by the ability of light to penetrate tissues. Due to this limitation, Cerenkov luminescence (CL) from radionuclides has recently been proposed as an alternative light source in a strategy referred to as Cerenkov radiation\u2010induced therapy (CRIT). Semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) have ideal optical properties, such as large absorption cross\u2010sections and broad absorbance, which can be utilized to harness the relatively weak CL produced by radionuclides. SPNs can be doped with photosensitizers and have \u2248100% energy transfer efficiency by multiple energy transfer mechanisms. Herein, an optimized photosensitizer\u2010doped SPN is investigated as a nanosystem to harness and amplify CL for cancer theranostics. It is found that semiconducting polymers significantly amplify CL energy transfer efficiency. Bimodal positron emission tomography (PET) and optical imaging studies show high tumor uptake and retention of the optimized SPNs when administered intravenously or intratumorally. Lastly, it is found that photosensitizer\u2010doped SPNs have excellent potential as a cancer theranostics nanosystem in an in vivo tumor therapy study. This study shows that SPNs are ideally suited to harness and amplify CL for cancer theranostics, which may provide a significant advancement for CRIT that are unabated by tissue penetration limits.",

            "text": "connected with it). Therefore, applications of these techniques are limited due to the lack of sufficient sensitivity to detect small numbers of malignant cells in the primary or even metastatic sites [1]. It is also difficult to detect specific cancer cell-surface markers, which are not only a target for cancer therapy but can also assist in the diagnosis and staging of cancer. Other challenges include inadequate drug concentrations reaching the tumor and the limited ability to monitor therapeutic responses thus leading to significant complications such as multidrug resistance due to poor drug delivery [1]. \n\nRecent advances in nanotechnology have immensely contributed to the development of multifunctional nanoparticles that can target a tumor or tumor-specific delivery of imaging probes, deliver therapeutic drugs or genes, respond to external triggers to release the agent and also monitor the therapeutic response [1][2][3][4][5]. \n\nMultifunctional nanoparticles can be fabricated from different materials in a variety of compositions. These include quantum dots, polymeric nanoparticles, gold nanoparticles and superparamagnetic nanoparticles [2]. This multifunctionality is generated by combining these nanoparticles with a specific targeting agent for imaging, a cell penetrating agent for drug release and any suitable stabilizing polymer to generate biocompatibility etc. These nanoparticles provide several unique features and capabilities in comparison with conventional invivo imaging probes or contrast agents. Firstly, being 100-to 10,000-fold smaller than cancer cells, these can easily transfer or penetrate through blood vessels and interact with targeted tumor-specific proteins. Secondly, their optical and electronic properties can be tuned by simply varying their size. These sizedependent tunable properties can be used for simultaneous detection of multiple cancer biomarkers. Thirdly, their high surface area can be leveraged towards attachments of a variety of functional groups that can be linked to different diagnostics and therapeutic agents. In addition, recent research has also shown that smaller nanoparticles (1-100 nm) tend to preferentially accumulate at the tumor sites which eventually results in the leakage of accumulated circulating nanoparticles into the tumor sites or tissues.",

It has found many applications in industries such as agriculture 1 and health care, 2 the latter of which it is showing considerable potential. 4][5][6] An important class of nanoparticles are those made of inorganic material (e.g., metal, metal oxides, semiconductors, silica) as their unique electric, magnetic and plasmonic properties enable them to destroy cancerous cells at the same time as being used to monitor tumor growth/ regression through imaging. 7,8 For example, iron based nanoparticles can induce hyperthermia in tissue through heat generation when under a magnetic \ue103eld 9 and/or be used as contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). 10 emiconductor nanoparticles such as quantum dots use their energy band gaps for \ue104uorescence imaging with an alloy core encapsulated in an insulating inorganic shell to enhance their quantum yield. 11 Due to their narrow \ue104uorescence emission and broad absorption spectra, multiple quantum dots can be excited at a time for in vivo imaging of multiple components in biological systems. 12 Such different types of nanoparticles show great potential for biomedical applications. Having said this, there continues to be a need for different methods/techniques and technologies for imaging and synthesizing nanoparticles that can greatly enhance speci\ue103c target signals (i.e., from tumor) while minimizing background signals (i.e., from tissue). The NPs and imaging modality at the same time should allow for greater depths of imaging in tissue compared to conventional imaging. \n\nOne kind of inorganic nanoparticle able to provide deeper imaging in vivo are gold nanoparticles, able to release nonradiative heat from localized surface plasmon resonance, a phenomenon in which electrons oscillate coherently in resonance with the incident electromagnetic wave at a speci\ue103c frequency. In most cases for deeper penetration and imaging in vivo, the frequency of oscillation is shi\ue09ded from the visible to the near-infrared (NIR) region by increasing the aspect ratio of the nanoparticles 13 and/or aggregation through the interparticle coupling effect. 14",

Based on AL intensity determination by the amount of high-energy PPV-dioxetane generated, PPV-SPNs were designed to exploit FRET and TPP promotion of 1 O 2 generation, thereby amplifying AL. The constructed SPNs (SPN2.5) showed the NIR AL peaks at 720 nm with an intensity 6.12-fold brighter than the nanoparticles without TPP (SPN0). The oxygen-sensitive AL of SPN2.5 was useful for in vivo imaging of tumor hypoxia and tiny peritoneal metastatic tumor tissues in living mice could be detected following systemic administration of SPN2.5, a feat that could not be replicated by fluorescence imaging alone (Fig. 5B). In the same year, the Pu lab reported their advancements in ultrasensitive imaging of living mouse metastatic tumors using amphiphilic polystyrene derivatives self-assembled into nano agents (SPPVN) that emitted NIR AL [77]. Doping of PPV-PEG nanoparticles with 2% NCBS photosensitizer, facilitated improved FRET efficiency, the generation of 1 O 2 by light irradiation, and enhanced AL intensity at a peak emission of 780 nm and 20-fold greater brightness than PPV-PEG nanoparticles without NCBS. The SPPVN nanoparticles emitted a bright and persistent NIR AL that penetrated deep tissue to a depth of up to 1.6 cm, facilitating peritoneal metastatic tumor detection and outperforming fluorescence imaging, with SBRs of 602 AE 104 and 40 AE 3, respectively (Fig. 5C). In addition, SPPVNs were highly sensitive to oxygen levels and accumulated in tumors.",

            "text": "Inorganic NPs are useful in cancer detection and diagnostic applications because of their photochemical, photothermal, and magnetic properties, and feasibility owing to their complex, durable cores and rigid outer surface with various kinds of drug agents. Several magnetic NPs, such as superparamagnetic iron oxide particles, have been used in image contrast and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for tumor detection. The diagnostic capability of these NPs can be enhanced by the complexity of surface modifications of these molecules with targeting functionalities, such as therapeutic superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs),which are made of an iron oxide NP core that carries both contrast agents for MRI as well as therapeutic drugs, and the coating on the surface is favorable for interactions between biological systems and SPION [152]. Furthermore, gold NPs are used in tumor imaging owing to their optical and electrical properties, and have been described as \"promising nanocarriers for therapeutics\" because of their easy synthesis and functionalization, relative biocompatibility, and low toxicity [153]. These NPs can be easily modified as they present negative reactive groups on the surface and a core of gold atoms. Ultra-small gold NPs are uniformly distributed within the tumor tissues owing to their ability to diffuse through tissues; however, their use is limited by poor uptake. Semiconductor NPs called quantum dots (QD), owing to their quantum and size effects, have unique optical properties, which make them useful as imaging probes [154]. The most commonly used QD system is composed of an inner semiconductor core of CdSe coated with a ZnS outer shell. QDs are also used as biosensors for cancer diagnosis owing to their unique properties, such as prolonged, stable, and intense fluorescence, resistance to photobleaching, and highly sensitive detection [155]. Moreover, some organic polymers have been fabricated along with gold NPs and QDs to form hybrid systems in order to achieve drug packaging and diagnostic capabilities for effective drug delivery along with treatment response and real-time monitoring of tumor activity [156].",

            "text": "Luminescent semiconducting polymer dots-Semiconductor polymer dots (Pdots) have rapidly garnered interest as an alternative to semiconductor quantum dots and fluorescent dyes in nanoscale fluorescence imaging and sensing applications [1]. Pdots are nanoparticles ranging from 10 to 100 nm in diameter. They are primarily composed of a semiconducting polymer and additives to enable their aqueous solubility and unique emission properties [2]. When synthesized with no dopant dyes, the formed Pdots largely retain the optical properties of the bulk semiconducting polymer, with decreased quantum yield and the appearance of a red emission tail being the only noticeable differences. Luminescent Pdots are characterized with low batch-to-batch variance in emission properties. This is in contrast to the high variance in emission properties often observed with other semiconductor luminescent nanoparticles like inorganic quantum dots. Pdots have several desirable properties that make them attractive alternatives to other luminescent nanoparticles. The high brightness of Pdots is owed to their fast emissive rates and large extinction coefficients [3]. Since each monomer with the polymer chain is capable of absorbing incident light, the high concentration of chromophores in Pdots gives them extinction coefficients an order of magnitude higher than luminescent quantum dots and two orders of magnitude greater than organic dyes [4]. Furthermore, Pdots are highly resistant to photobleaching, which make them excellent candidates for fluorescence imaging and sensing applications [1]. Recent advancements in polymer design have produced drastic enhancements in quantum yield, up to 0.98 [5]. Finally, Pdots exhibit minimal or no cytotoxicity towards mammalian cells which distinguish them from heavy metal, cadmium and lead containing quantum dots [6]. \n\nPolymer Dot Synthesis-One of the greatest advantages of Pdots is their low-cost, facile synthesis. Although there are several methods by which to prepare Pdots, the one that produces the smallest Pdots and is most commonly used is the nanoprecipitation method [7]. A schematic diagram which describes the nanoprecipitation used in our laboratory and others to form near infrared highly emitting dye-doped Pdots is shown in Scheme 1.",

            "text": "There are many types of nanoparticles, including metallic, magnetic, polymeric, metal oxide, quantum dots, graphene, fullerene, liposomes, carbon nanotubes, and dendrimers, which are used in breast, colon, and cervical cancer diagnosis. Additionally, they are important for some imaging functions. It has been found that nanoparticles remain in the blood circulation for a long period of time before reaching the target cells, where they traverse many biological walls such as cell membranes and interact with biological systems (Figure 2). Moreover, cancer-specific antibodies can be conjugated with nanoparticles for better cancer binding and detection. Many recent studies have demonstrated that nanoparticles and sensors have significant potential for increasing the sensitivity of tumor detection and improving cancer diagnosis [13]. It has been reported that the detection of methylation patterns and mutations has been used as a marker for cancer diagnosis. It has been suggested that more studies are required before using extracellular vesicles, circulating tumor cells, and cell-free RNA in clinical diagnosis [14]. Researchers have used fluorescent gold nanoclusters (GNCs) or superparamagnetic (Fe3O4/GNCs), (\u03b3-Mercaptopropyl) trimethoxysilane (MPS) as a stabilizing agent. The prepared GNCs@MPS was conjugated on the surface of \"Fe3O4@SiO2 nanoparticles\" followed by the addition of \"poly ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (PGD)\" to form Fe3O4/GNCs nanoprobes. It has been found that (Fe3O4/GNCs/Aptamer) is capable of uptake in HL60 cancer cells [15]. Various metallic nanoparticles have shown better sensitivity in detecting tumor cells as they can be conjugated with cancer-specific antibodies and penetrate cancer cells more effectively. Studies have reported that nanocomposites containing more than one type of nanoparticle, such as gold, platinum, silver, copper, and cobalt, are better candidates for cancer detection and imaging.",

            "text": "QDs are characterized by special optical properties, which enhance their usefulness in cancer cell detection [65]. Due to their high quantum yields, QDs are helpful in the detection of materials with low abundance. However, to enhance QD electrical characteristics, Pang et al. [52] hybridized ZnO NDs and g-C3N4 QDs to afford higher photoelectron transfer and separation efficiency. Due to the outstanding advantages, ZnO NDs and g-C3N4 QDs enjoyed the extended application, and a photocatalyzed renewable self-powered cytosensing device was presented on the basis of ZnO NDs@g-C3N4 QDs. Through conjugation to the membrane PTK7-specific aptamer Sgc8c, the device was used to detect CCRF-CEM cells (human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells), which express PTK7. The results showed that the device offers better performance in terms of detection range, detection limit, selectivity, and reproducibility. It captured only CCRF-CEM cells (500 cell/mL) and no other cell types, such as HL-60, K562, and HeLa cells. The authors think that the device could be an effective platform for monitoring the progression of leukemia and shows great promise. \n\nPolymer nanoparticles derived from various conductive hydrophobic polymers have been applied to produce nanoparticles with high quantum yields, photostability and that are nontoxic. Therefore, PD is ideal for CTC detection. Wu et al. [66] reported a strategy for semiconducting polymer dots (PDs) functionalization through entrapment of heterogeneous polymer chains into a single dot, which was facilitated by hydrophobic interactions, during nanoparticle formation. A few amphiphilic polymers with functional groups for subsequent covalent conjugation of biomolecules, such as streptavidin and immunoglobulin G (IgG), show co-condensation with most semiconducting polymers for modification and functionalization of a nanoparticle surface.",

Semiconducting polymer-based nanoparticles can be used for molecular imaging, phototherapy, and photoregulation because of their good biocompatibility and unique optical property (Jiang and Pu, 2018). Such SPN II R with a core-shell structure contained three main components: a semiconducting polymer nanoparticle core as the NIR-II photothermal converter, a toll-like receptor (TLR) agonist (R848) as the immunotherapeutic adjuvant, and a thermally responsive lipid shell on the nanoparticle surface. The thermally responsive lipid shell was constructed using 1,2dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC), a thermal phospholipid with a phase-transition temperature of 41 \u00b0C, and an amphiphilic polymer, 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3phosphoethanolamine-poly(ethylene glycol) (DSPE-PEG), and could be melted after a photothermal effect. SPN II R exhibited an effective accumulation into tumors after systemic administration, which may be due to their small size and surface PEG corona. Upon NIR-II photoactivation at 1,064 nm, SPN II R produced heat to induce tumor cell death and immunogenic cell death (ICD). Meanwhile, the generated heat could melt thermally responsive lipid shell for controlled release of R848 to active TLR7/TLR8, thereby promoting the maturation of DCs and priming of antitumor T cells. Via the synergetic action of NIR-II PTT and immunotherapy, the growth of both primary and distant tumors and lung metastasis in a 4T1 tumor-bearing BALB/c mouse model was effectively suppressed after a single treatment.",

            "text": "Cancer has been one of the deadliest diseases that human society has ever witnessed [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11]. Though there have been dramatic improvements in early diagnosis, detection, and therapy, it still remains as deadly as ever before. With the advanced developments in cancer nanomedicine, it is now possible to combat cancers if detected early [12]. Nanomedicine [13][14][15][16], particularly use both fundamental science and bio-molecular engineering, in order to have better precision medicines [17]. Even though there have been various treatment regimens using nanomedicines, phototherapy is of great importance as it is minimally invasive and causes no side effects on the body [18][19][20][21][22]. There are two main streams of phototherapy, namely photo-thermal therapy (PTT) and photo-dynamic therapy (PDT), and both of them use light as their main source of action. \n\nTypically, PTT works by absorbing infra-red (NIR) light (by rationally engineered photo absorbing agents) and converting it into therapeutic heat [23]. On the other hand, PDT use light energy to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), particularly singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ), that can effectively hinder pathogenesis [24]. These two mechanisms can be combined to have multi-effect on better therapeutic outcome. A variety of nanomaterials such as organic and inorganic NIR sensitive agents have been explored for photo-therapy. Among them, semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPN) became very attractive recently due to their opto-electronic characteristics [25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36]. \n\nSPN have been used for photo-therapy including PTT, PDT and their combination owing to its aromatic structure with \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions generating heat when exposed under NIR light [37,38].",

            "text": "Cancer is recognized as the second major cause of death in the United States. Unfortunately, traditional methods for the treatment of cancer, such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, and surgery are plagued by limitations, which either resulting in incomplete tumor removal or the induction of undesirable side effects. Materials such as polypyrrole, polyaniline, polydopamine, and PEDOT:PSS have proven to be flexible platforms with the capability of multifunctional modifications that enabling synergistic approaches with traditional cancer therapies, potentially mitigating any adverse side effects. These technologies have shown great promise, and new technologies with enhanced capabilities, such as those enabling PTT via the utilization of light in the NIR-II range, thereby achieving greater depth of penetration have started to emerge. Reproduced from [76] with permission, copyright American Chemical Society, 2018. \n\nTherefore, the development of polymers capable of responding to light in the NIR-II range will enable enhanced therapeutic outcomes and should be considered in the future development of polymer-based nanoparticle systems. As discussed in this review, several polymeric nanoparticle systems have been demonstrated to be activated by the NIR spectrum, providing sufficient energy to exert hyperthermic effects. However, compared with inorganic materials, the performance of polymeric nanoparticles is likely to be weak because of photobleaching effects. To overcome this innate drawback, more sophisticated photothermal therapy based on polymeric nanoparticle systems should be pursed. Improved antitumor response by advanced NIR-triggered drug release might be able to overcome the natural pitfalls of polymeric-based nanoparticle systems.",

            "text": "Noble metals, especially nano-sized gold, have the ability to convert absorbed energy (light) to heat through the LSPR effect [14,23]. For in vivo application, the LSPR frequency of the gold nanoparticle must be tuned to the NIR range for deep tissue penetration, which can be achieved by adjusting the aspect ratio, shell thickness or architecture of the nanoparticles [23,27]. Early efforts on adjusting the LSPR frequency of gold nanoparticles focused on tuning the shape of gold nanoparticles by making them into nanorods or nanocages [116][117][118][119]. Through elongation, the LSPR peak associated with the long axis of the nanorods could be tuned from the visible to NIR range [120]. The formation of nanoshells generates pinholes in the wall, increasing in number as the thickness of the wall decreases, with a concomitant red-shift of the LSPR peak to the NIR range [121,122]. Their tumor ablation efficacy has been successfully demonstrated on a subcutaneous or orthotopic tumor mouse model when combined with 808 nm laser irradiation [117,122]. Instead of making hollow cubes, gold nanotubes were recently developed, the LSPR peak of which was tunable via adjustment of the nanotube length [123]. Interestingly, gold quantum dots (~2 nm) also have unique optical and paramagnetic properties compared with gold nanoparticles. Due to their high surface energy, gold quantum dots have to be stabilized with a mesoporous silica shell, forming a structure called a quantum rattle (QR) (Figure 5A). These QRs could emit NIR fluorescence (812 nm) and generate heat under 672 nm laser irradiation [124], and thus are ideal LTNs capable of tri-modal tumor imaging (fluorescence, MRI and PA imaging) and PTT. Recently, a new gold nanostructure, named the gold beltflower (GBF), was reported by Chen and colleagues, further demonstrating the importance of nanostructure design in photothermal conversion efficiency determination [125].",

Their biocompatibility and tunable properties make polymers invaluable for various medical and preclinical applications of photoacoustic imaging, ranging from cancer detection and vascular imaging to monitoring physiological processes in real-time. \n\nPu and colleagues have introduced semiconducting polymer nanoparticles prepared from poly(cyclopentadithiophene-alt-benzothiadiazole) and poly(acenaphthothienopyrazine-alt-benzodithiophene) which absorb near-infrared light as innovative contrast agents for photoacoustic molecular imaging [87]. These nanoparticles outperformed traditional agents like gold nanorods and single-walled carbon nanotubes, delivering enhanced signal strength and enabling real-time, in vivo imaging of reactive oxygen species. When combined with therapeutic agents, this platform holds significant potential as a robust theranostic tool. In another study ma et al. prepared a biodegradable semiconducting polymer from diketopyrrolopyrrole with excellent photoacousitc imaging application in vivo for the \u03bb-carrageenaninduced arthritis mouse model [88]. Polypyrrole based NPs were fabricated by Kesa et. al. and they studied the in vivo applications of these NPs for ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging applications on a mouse model [89]. An intense photoacoustic signal was clearly observed in the anterior wall of the mouse heart after the NPs injection. \n\nThus from the existing literature reports polymers can enhance the bioimaging applications as a carrier for imaging agents or by modulating the surface and conjugation properties of polymers. Various polymer materials used for bioimaging applications are given in table 1.",

It has strong absorption in 800 to 1350 nm [Fig. 9(b)] for PAI in the NIR-II window. 169 An US imaging system (Vantage128, Verasonics Inc.) with EKSPLA OPO laser (5 ns and 10 Hz) was used for imaging. A refection-mode detection was applied using a high-frequency US array (L22-14v, Verasonics Inc.). For skin imaging [Fig. 9(c)], TSPNs (50 \u03bcL, 40 \u03bcg\u2215mL) were injected subcutaneously into the dorsal area of the rats. Without injection, the PA signal was weak at 1100 and 1300 nm and strong at 800 and 1000 nm, due to the absorption of blood at these wavelengths. The strong signal at 1200 nm was generated from the subcutaneous fat in the skin layer. After injection, the PA signal increased by \u223c7.3-fold at 1100 nm and by \u223c10.7-fold at 1300 nm, compared to the signal found in the skin tissue without injection. This significant signal enhancement indicated the capability of TSPN as an exogenous contrast agent for in vivo skin imaging. \n\nIn vivo images of tumor in mice with and without TSPNs are shown in Fig. 9(d observed from the tumor at 800 and 1000 nm, which are attributed to the rich blood vessels surrounding the tumor. The signals above the tumor at 1200 nm are more likely from skin fats. Intratumoral injection was performed to deliver TSPNs (50 \u03bcL, 40 \u03bcg\u2215mL) into the tumor area, then strong PA signals were generated within the tumor area (dashed circles) due to the strong absorption of excitation wavelengths 800 to 1300 nm by the TSPNs. Compared to the images of the tumor without TSPNs, the signal was enhanced \u223c7.0-fold at 1100 nm and \u223c13.3-fold at 1300 nm. Reports on NIR-II tumor imaging 116,154 promised that it can provide high sensitivity and depth for tumor imaging compared to NIR-I window.",

(2021) reported a semiconducting polymer nanoengager (SPNE) for efficient NIR-II photothermal immunotherapy (Figure 9). SPNE uses NIR-II absorption polymer (semiconducting polymer nanoparticles [SPNs]) as photothermal core and uses fusion membrane from immune engineering tumor cells and DCs as cancer vaccine shell. On one hand, the homologous targeting of cancer cell membrane makes the SPNE highly accumulate in the tumor site, on the other hand, the existence of DC cell membrane endows SPNE with the function of interacting with T cells. In a word, SPNE can cross the biological barrier with the help of cancer cell membrane, and at the same time, the antigen presentation of DC cell membrane surface protein and T cells can promote T cell proliferation, recognize and kill tumor, and finally achieve the goal of photothermal synergism to enhance immunotherapy. The mice were injected intravenously, and the long-term antitumor immunity results showed that after 30 d of treatment, the proportion of T cells \n\nin lymph nodes of mice was about six times higher than that of tumor-bearing mice and healthy mice after 1 d of treatment. Moreover, \n\naccounted for nearly 50% of the total T cells in mouse lymph nodes after 30 d, nearly five times higher than other groups, confirming the immune memory established by SPNE-mediated photothermal immunotherapy.",

            "text": "Background The overall survival rate of osteosarcoma (OS) patients has not been improved for 30\u2009years, and the diagnosis and treatment of OS is still a critical issue. To improve OS treatment and prognosis, novel kinds of theranostic modalities are required. Molecular optical imaging and phototherapy, including photothermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT), are promising strategies for cancer theranostics that exhibit high imaging sensitivity as well as favorable therapeutic efficacy with minimal side effect. In this study, semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPN-PT) for OS-targeted PTT/PDT are designed and prepared, using a semiconducting polymer (PCPDTBT), providing fluorescent emission in the second near-infrared window (NIR-II, 1000 - 1700\u2009nm) and photoacoustic (PA) signal in the first near-infrared window (NIR-I, 650 - 900\u2009nm), served as the photosensitizer, and a polyethylene glycolylated (PEGylated) peptide PT, providing targeting ability to OS. Results The results showed that SPN-PT nanoparticles significantly accelerated OS-specific cellular uptake and enhanced therapeutic efficiency of PTT and PDT effects in OS cell lines and xenograft mouse models. SPN-PT carried out significant anti-tumor activities against OS both in vitro and in vivo. Conclusions Peptide-based semiconducting polymer nanoparticles permit efficient NIR-II fluorescence/NIR-I PA dual-modal imaging and targeted PTT/PDT for OS. Graphic Abstract",

For example, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is highly valued for its superior spatial resolution and ability to provide detailed anatomical imaging. However, it often requires the use of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) to enhance contrast, especially in soft tissue imaging. Despite these enhancements, MRI's functional sensitivity is limited compared to other modalities, such as Positron Emission Tomography (PET) (Shin & Cheon, 2015). PET imaging, when combined with radiolabeled nanoparticles, offers excellent sensitivity and functional information about metabolic processes within tumors. However, its spatial resolution is generally lower than that of MRI, limiting its standalone diagnostic potential (Fang & Zhang, 2010). \n\nOptical imaging, utilizing quantum dots as fluorescent markers, provides real-time imaging with high sensitivity, enabling detection of smaller lesions. However, optical imaging's depth penetration remains a significant limitation, restricting its use to superficial tissues unless invasive techniques are employed. Meanwhile, Computed Tomography (CT) enhanced with metallic nanoparticles, such as gold, offers high spatial resolution and rapid imaging, particularly effective for detecting calcified tissues. However, CT imaging has limited functional imaging capability and exposes patients to ionizing radiation, which may not be ideal for longitudinal studies (Ryvolova et al., 2012). Multi-modal imaging approaches seek to harness the strengths of each modality while compensating for inherent weaknesses. By combining MRI with PET or optical imaging, for instance, clinicians can achieve both high spatial and functional resolution, allowing for more comprehensive tumor characterization. Such hybrid approaches illustrate the growing potential of dual-functional nanoparticle-based systems in advancing cancer diagnostics (Cai et al., 2007). However, further research is required to optimize these multimodal systems, especially concerning nanoparticle stability, toxicity, and regulatory approval for clinical use.",

These NPs were intravenously injected to bloodstream in mouse model, where they circulate and reach the brain as shown in Fig. 10d. NIR-II Laser targeted the mouse brain, exciting the NPs to produce US waves (blue ripples), which are detected by PA imaging system. The right panel in Fig. 10d focuses on the brain, showed the interaction of amphiphilic NPs with BBB, crossing into brain tissue, facilitating non-invasiveness imaging of neural structures. This demonstrated the application of DSPE-mPEG NPs in preclinical brain imaging. These NPs visualized brain vasculature effectively, with signal persistence for 3 h post-injection (Fig. 10e), demonstrating their potential for PA brain imaging [14]. \n\nSemiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) have proven to be highly effective contrast agents for PA imaging, particularly in brain tumor imaging. Their unique properties, such as efficient photothermal conversion, excellent photostability, and strong NIR absorption, make them ideal for deep brain imaging. Different donoracceptor systems have been explored to enhance their PA affects and stability, resulting in nanoparticles that can cross the BBB and provide clear PA signals with low toxicity. The copolymer NPs (pentathiophene donors and benzobisthiadiazole acceptors), Dithieno pyrrole copolymers, and Metabolizable NIR-II PA contrast agents encapsulated with PLGA-PEG showed effective brain vasculature imaging and signal persistence. Among them, PDI NPs stood out for their strong NIR absorption and efficient photothermal conversion. With donor-acceptor feature, these PDI NPs provide robust PA signals, especially when modified with DSPE-mPEG5000. PDI have demonstrated significant PA signal enhancement under 700 nm laser irradiation with orthotopic glioblastoma. These properties make PDI nanoparticles a promising choice for advanced PABI applications.",

The so-called phototheranostics which combines phototherapies and optical imaging not only permits precise administration of phototherapies under imaging guidance, but also realizes real-time therapeutic effects monitoring, thus reduces side effects and prevents recurrence. Therefore, development of biomaterials for NIR-II fluorescence/ PA imaging-based phototheranostic systems is highly demanded. \n\nTo date, however, the uptake of biomaterials into tumor tissues and cells is mostly the controversial enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) [20][21][22]. It has been recommended that active transcytosis techniques be developed for delivery efficiency enhancement [21,23], including utilization of tumorpenetrating peptides [24] and design of polymer conjugates [25]. Providing with high binding affinity and specificity to certain extracellular ligands, targeting peptides possess advantages including convenient synthesis and easy chemical modification, good histocompatibility, low immunogenicity, favorable pharmacokinetics, and acceptable in vivo stability and integrity [26,27], and have emerged as an alternative to molecular targeting ligands [28]. Among these, peptide PT (PPSHTPT) has been constructed to mimic natural protein osteocalcin property in vivo and has shown its targeted binding to osteosarcoma in vitro and in vivo [29][30][31]. \n\nHerein, we report an oligopeptide PT based semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPN-PT), which shows OS targeting ability, for NIR-II fluorescence and NIR-I PA dual-modal imaging guided PTT and PDT therapies. Semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) represent an emerging class of organic photonic agents fabricated by optically active semiconducting polymers [32], which have been tremendously explored for the applications such as fluorescence imaging [33], PA imaging [34], PTT [35] and PDT [36].",

            "text": "Semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) are explored for applications in cancer theranostics because of their high absorption coefficients, photostability, and biocompatibility. However, SPNs are susceptible to aggregation and protein fouling in physiological conditions, which can be detrimental for in vivo applications. Here, a method for achieving colloidally stable and low\u2010fouling SPNs is described by grafting poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) onto the backbone of the fluorescent semiconducting polymer, poly(9,9\u2032\u2010dioctylfluorene\u20105\u2010fluoro\u20102,1,3\u2010benzothiadiazole), in a simple one\u2010step substitution reaction, postpolymerization. Further, by utilizing azide\u2010functionalized PEG, anti\u2010human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) antibodies, antibody fragments, or affibodies are site\u2010specifically \u201cclicked\u201d onto the SPN surface, which allows the functionalized SPNs to specifically target HER2\u2010positive cancer cells. In vivo, the PEGylated SPNs are found to have excellent circulation efficiencies in zebrafish embryos for up to seven days postinjection. SPNs functionalized with affibodies are then shown to be able to target HER2 expressing cancer cells in a zebrafish xenograft model. The covalent PEGylated SPN system described herein shows great potential for cancer theranostics.",

The peak of LSRP absorbance could also be precisely tuned by controlling the size of vesicles [136] or the aspect ratio of gold nanoparticles [137]. The peak of LSPR absorbance shifted more toward the NIR region when gold nanorods were used and large vesicles were formed.

For example, iron oxide nanoparticles have been widely used to improve magnetic resonance imaging contrast, providing clearer visualization of tumor boundaries and microenvironments (Chen, 2010). Quantum dots, another type of nanoparticle, are especially effective in optical imaging due to their bright fluorescence and photostability, enabling detailed imaging at the cellular level (Idoko et al., 2024). By leveraging such properties, nanoparticle-based imaging can facilitate the early detection of tumors, even those that are otherwise challenging to detect with traditional methods, ultimately supporting more accurate diagnosis and improving patient prognosis. \n\nFurthermore, nanoparticles enable controlled and localized drug delivery, a crucial advancement for reducing systemic toxicity and enhancing the therapeutic index of anticancer drugs. By encapsulating or chemically binding drugs, nanoparticles protect therapeutic agents from premature degradation and allow for controlled release at the target site. Stimuli-responsive nanoparticles, which release their drug payloads in response to specific triggers such as pH, temperature, or enzymatic activity, offer precise control over drug release, ensuring that treatment is concentrated within the tumor and spares surrounding healthy tissues (Ferrari, 2005). With these capabilities, nanoparticles provide not only improved efficacy in drug delivery but also contribute to a significant reduction in adverse effects compared to non-targeted therapies. Consequently, nanoparticle-based systems hold vast potential to redefine cancer management by integrating enhanced imaging with highly targeted drug delivery, thus offering a more comprehensive and effective approach to treatment.",

Due to the potential toxicities associated with naked inorganic NPs, in many cases such inorganic NPs are coated with other biocompatible molecules, e.g., polymers such as PEG [67], chitosan [68] or dextran [69]. Inorganic NPs include mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs), carbon dots (CDs), graphene quantum dots (GQDs), gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), and iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs [23]). Compared to organic NPs, which are usually spherical, inorganic NPs can be manufactured as well-controlled physical structures and shapes. These include porous, core-shell, nanorods, and cubes, each of which can influence and be critical to their optical, thermal and magnetic-responsive properties. \n\nOne unique advantage of metallic and inorganic NPs is that some of them are inherently image-detectable. For example, some light-absorbing CDs, GQDs and AuNPs are imageable in fluorescence imaging or photoacoustic imaging. AuNPs are also CT contrast agents and IONPs are MRI contrast agents. Formulating those NPs as nanotheranostics obviates the need for adding extra image labels. If there is a need to enable multi-modal imaging by introducing another imaging label, metallic NPs, such AuNP, can be surface-activated to add imaging labels, while inorganic NPs, such as GQD, can form nanocomposites with Gd 2 O 3 , as an example, to gain MRI detectability [70]. These NPs can also form core-shell or porous structures to load imaging labels inside [71,72].",

Inorganic nanoparticles like gold nanoparticles, iron oxide nanoparticles, and molybdenum disulfide (MoS\u2082) exhibit strong photoacoustic signals and deep tissue penetration. Gold containing inorganic formulations such as nanospheres, nanocomposites and quantum dots (QDs) were also successful in PABI along with certain hybrid materials such as metal containing nanodroplets. Several nano formulations in the form of organic porphysomes, perfluorocarbon-based nanodroplets, polymeric nanoparticles, were utilized as contrast agents for PABI [91]. Organic nanoparticles, such as ICG-conjugated polymers and novel NIR-II dyes like A1094, improve brain imaging with reduced scattering and enhanced photothermal effects. Semiconductor nanoparticles offer high photothermal conversion efficiency, stability, and effective BBB penetration, making them suitable for brain tumor imaging. \n\nVascular permeability of tumor was monitored using PAI after intravenous injection of ICG, which could be utilized for screening the targeted delivery of drug molecules [92]. Cu 2+ based nanomaterial was reported to cross BBB and has shown favor in PABI with Alzheimer's disease [93]. Similarly, nano formulations made of gold and carbon nanotubes have been studied extensively for crossing BBB, were also utilized for PAI due to the strong NIR light absorption through localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect [91,94]. Several organic dye and polymeric nanoparticles were successfully delivered to the tumor site across the tumor vasculature guided by photoacoustic imaging methods. Dendrimers incorporated with organic dyes were delivered across BBB and was successful in imaging and treating glioblastoma using thermal expansion and PA cavitation, respectively [95]. \n\nUtilization of gold nanoparticles as a substrate for therapeutic gene containing vectors has shown successful delivery to breast cancer tissue and enhanced treatment outcome [96].",

            "text": "Today, cancer mortality is one of the most common causes of death. The application of nanotechnology in medicine includes six areas including 1) detection of molecular changes in diseases; 2) diagnosis and imaging; 3) drug delivery; 4) combined therapeutic and diagnostic applications; 5) report of therapeutic agent efficacy; and 6) nanotechnology applications in scientific discovery and basic research (56). A variety of nanostructures from organic and inorganic materials have been recently used for cancer therapy and diagnosis in passive or active tumor targeting. A novel formulation of nanovesicles, liposomes, polymeric micelles, dendrimers, and polymeric nanoparticles can enter into the solid tumor site through the porous structure of a tumor vascular system, and then, selectively deliver the therapeutic agents (57,58). Nanomaterials with proper targeting ligands could bind to antigens or receptors on the target cells. However, this powerful technology leads to a decreased toxicity in non-targeted cells, and therefore, the distribution of nanomaterials will be increased in the target cells (59). Some of the nanomaterials shown in Table 2 (60-73) such as semiconducting nanoparticles or quantum dots (QDs), colloidal nanoparticles, dendrimers, magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), carbon-based nanomaterials (CBNs), and liposomal nanoparticles systems have been constructed for utilization in therapeutic applications. Quantum dots (QDs) are semiconducting nanoparticles with the diameter ranging from 2\u223c10 nm, narrow emission and broad absorption profile, high photostability, long fluorescence lifespan, ability to be conjugated with proteins (74). Also, QDs have the potential of applications in molecular and cellular labelling, cell tracking, drug delivery and also, cancer detection and therapy (75,76). Dendrimers are highly branched synthetic polymers (about 1.5\u223c13.5 nm) (77,78) that have attracted considerable attention because of their hyper-branched structure, monodispersity, functional surface groups, and symmetrical conformation (79).",

            "text": "In vivo brain imaging was demonstrated in NIR-I and NIR-II windows using semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs). The details of the SPN-I having absorption in NIR-I, and SNP-II having absorption from visible to NIR-II regions can be found in Ref. 152. The schematic representation of SPN-II nanoparticle and optical absorption spectra of SPN-I and SPN-II are shown in Figs. 6(a) and 6(b), respectively. The SPN-II showed a spectrum ranging from visible to NIR-II region with the maximum peak at 1253 nm. The SPN-II (6 mg/mL, 300 \u03bcL per rat) was injected into the rat through intravenous injection. After injection, brain images were acquired using the homemade PAT system, as shown in Fig. 6(c). Postinjection brain images were acquired at 750 nm for up to 70 min. It was observed that the PA signals from the blood vessels increased by 66% and the SNR was enhanced by about 1.5-fold after injection. The SNR was stabilized for 70 min, indicating the long circulation of SPN-II in blood owing to its small diameter (\u223c54 nm) and PEG-passivated The PIGD nanoparticles (discussed in Sec. 3.1) were also demonstrated for in vivo brain imaging at 1064 nm. 136 The cerebral cortex of a rat brain was imaged at 1064 nm before and after a single injection of PIGD NPs (0.25 mL per rat, 2 mg/mL). The cross-sectional images of the rat brain at 0 min (before injection) and 70 min after injection are shown in Figs. 6(f  strong, indicating that a sufficient amount of NPs circulate in the blood. Long circulation of NPs could be due to their suitable size of \u223c25 nm and the PEGylated surfaces. This in vivo brain imaging proved that even though blood absorption is low in the NIR-II window, by using suitable long-circulating nanoparticles, it is possible to achieve contrast-enhanced PAI of brain vessels of small animals with intact skin and skull.",

However, toxicity and the disruption of shielding surface modi\ue103cation are critical concerns for their biological applications. 2,3,12 NIR-emitting CPNs, in contrast, offer a high brightness, good photostability, and minimal toxicity to biological cells and tissues.

[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11] For example, low molecular weight, hydrophobic NIR dyes have been encapsulated within a CPN core resulting in quenching of visible emission of the conjugated polymer with distinct NIR emission 2 or multiple cascading light emitting polymers have been produced, which transfer the energy more efficiently to the dopant dye. 4 Disadvantages of such systems, however, include low CPN yields,",

[191] However, recent advancements in nanotechnology have revolutionized SDT by utilizing sonosensitizerconjugated nanoparticles for selective tumor eradication. [192,193] his strategy addresses the limitations of traditional SDT by providing advantages, such as enhanced tissue penetration, and improved tumor targeting capacity. [194] ased on the advancement of SDT, Wang et al. recently designed a semiconducting polymer nano-PROTAC (SPN FeP , 72). [195] SPN FeP was synthesized through a self-assemble nanoprecipitation process by integrating a sonodynamic semiconducting polymer, a ferroptosis inducer (ferrocene), a ROScleavable amphiphilic polymer, and a nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase (NAMPT) PROTAC. Upon ultrasound irradiation to the tumor, the semiconducting polymer works as a sonosensitizer to generate singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ), while the ferroptosis inducer reacts with intratumoral hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) to produce hydroxyl radicals ( * OH). This dual-ROS generating programmable process cleaves the ROS-cleavable polymer and induces the release of NAMPT PROTAC within the tumor. This spatiotemporal control of NAMPT degradation leads to an effective suppression of tumor infiltration of myeloidderived suppressive cells, which enhances antitumor immunity. The ultrasound nanoplatform enables precise regulation of PROTAC release through a dual-programmable activation mechanism, thereby increasing antitumor efficacy in deeptissue tumors.",

            "text": "For example, most phototheranostic systems use light in the first near-infrared (NIR-I) window (700-900 nm), which has low tissue penetration depth and imaging resolution (Miao and Pu, 2018). In contrast, light in the second NIR (NIR-II) window (1,000-1700 nm) shows both higher tissue penetration depth and imaging resolution. Thus, NIR-II-based phototheranostics may have a better efficiency both in the diagnosis and therapy than that based on NIR-I light (Jiang et al., 2018;Cai et al., 2019;Li et al., 2019a;Yang et al., 2020a;Zhou et al., 2020c;Zhu et al., 2019a;Xu et al., 2021). Compared with NIR-I dyes, NIR-II dyes have both longer excitation and emission wavelengths, thus leading to deeper tissue penetration depth (Table 1). Thus, development of suitable materials for NIR-II phototheranostics is of great significance. \n\nSemiconducting polymers (SPs) are a kind of polymer with \u03c0-conjugated backbones which have been widely applied in the field of sensors, electronic devices, and solar battery (Chan et al., 2011;Michinobu, 2011;Ye et al., 2011). Because SPs have poor water solubility, SPs are encapsulated by amphiphilic copolymers to form water soluble SP nanoparticles (SPNs) (Zhang et al., 2020a;Zhen et al., 2021;Zhou et al., 2021). Owing to the unique optical properties and good biocompatibility, SPNs are good candidates for phototheranostics (Guo et al., 2017a;Lyu et al., 2017;Sun et al., 2018). Compared with NIR-II fluorescent small molecule dyes, SPNs usually have high photostability and facile synthetic procedure (Zhou et al., 2020b;Zhen et al., 2021).",

            "text": "Cancer theranostics which integrates cancer imaging and therapy into one system provides the opportunity of continuous monitoring of therapeutic efficiency, thus allowing clinicians to design personalized medicine for each patient. 1,2 Among numerous imaging modalities, optical imaging which utilizes light as an excitation or signal source has gained more and more attention because of its advantages such as low toxicity, high sensitivity, low cost and minimal detection time. [3][4][5][6][7] Besides optical imaging, light can also trigger phototherapy including photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT), which are both promising therapeutic methods with the advantages of precise treatment and minimized side effects. [8][9][10][11] Thus, phototheranostics which combines optical imaging and phototherapy is a promising theranostic modality. [12][13][14] Until now, many materials have been developed as phototheranostic agents including near-infrared (NIR) dyes, [15][16][17][18][19] inorganic nanoparticles, 20,21 carbon and two-dimensional materials. [22][23][24] However, all of them have their own disadvantages such as poor photostability and low absorption coefficients. [25][26][27] Therefore, developing new optical agents with improved properties for phototheranostics is highly demanded.\n\nSemiconducting polymers (SPs) are macromolecules with pconjugated backbones, which have been widely applied in the \ue103elds of electronic devices and sensors because of their unique optical properties. 28 Recently, semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) derived from SPs have been applied in optical imaging owing to their high absorption coefficient, good photostability and biocompatibility. [29][30][31] In detail, SPNs can be applied in \ue104uorescence imaging including tumor imaging and cell tracking. [32][33][34][35] NIR-absorbing SPNs can be applied in photoacoustic (PA) imaging of stem cells, 36 vasculature, [37][38][39] tumor, [40][41]",

            "text": "Besides effective treatment, early and precise diagnosis is another goal of continued efforts in biomedical research [228]. There are various existing theragnostic imaging techniques, including optical imaging, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), computed tomography (CT), ultrasound imaging, and multimodal imaging. To date, a broad range of nanomaterials has been developed for these imaging techniques, many of which offer notable advantages over conventional molecular methods. These nanomaterials include superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPI-ONs) approved by FDA for MRI contrast acquisition [229], gold nanoparticles used for CT [230][231][232], and inorganic semiconducting NPs, such as quantum dots (QDs) or upconverting nanoparticles (UCNPs) used for narrow and tunable emission spectra in optical imaging [233][234][235][236]. However, some drawbacks of these imaging agents, such as difficulties in surface modification and physiological instability upon in vivo administration, need to be overcome. Although surface functionalization of many NPs faces extremely challenging barriers, such as the expulsion by the immune system or high osmotic pressure of cells, NPs have been widely exploited as vehicles for delivering imaging agents [237][238][239][240]. In addition, nano-sensors also tend to be inactivated due to the invasion and adsorption by serum proteins in a process known as biofouling [241,242]. Considering the unique advantages of MSNs, as described in Section 2, the integration of MSNs and nanomaterialbased imaging agents has proven to be highly promising. MSNs have been shown to be suitable for long-term quantitative imaging at low doses and safely cleared from the body following detection [243]. Besides, MSN-supported imaging agents have been developed with preserved essential imaging properties [244]. MSNs have demonstrated their potential to remain chemically stable in a colloidal suspension on various physiological conditions (i.e., ionic solvent, pH, and temperature) while providing a good imaging contrast (i.e., high signal-to-noise ratio) for various imaging modalities [28,245,246]",

AI-driven approaches further enhance cancer imaging by improving image processing, segmentation, and quantitative analysis [10]. Deep learning models are increasingly employed for automated tumor detection, feature extraction, and classification, reducing observer variability and enhancing diagnostic accuracy. AI also supports predictive modeling, enabling early-stage cancer detection and treatment response assessment [11]. \n\nimaging strategies that enhance sensitivity and specificity while minimizing adverse effects [3,4]. \n\nNanomaterials have emerged as promising agents for improving cancer imaging through enhanced contrast, targeted delivery, and multifunctional capabilities [5]. Their unique physicochemical properties enable selective tumor targeting and increased imaging sensitivity. Quantum dots (QDs), for instance, exhibit strong fluorescence properties, making them suitable for optical imaging [6]. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) enhance contrast in CT imaging due to their high X-ray attenuation coefficient [7]. Similarly, superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) serve as efficient contrast agents for MRI, improving signal intensity and tumor delineation [8]. The integration of nanomaterials in imaging platforms facilitates multimodal imaging, facilitating the combination of different imaging techniques for improved diagnostic accuracy. \n\nMonte Carlo (MC) simulations are widely used to model the interaction of nanoparticles with biological tissues, providing insights into light propagation, radiation dose distribution, and nanoparticle-mediated contrast enhancement [9]. These simulations enable precise predictions of nanoparticle behavior, optimizing their application in imaging and therapy. Figure 1 highlights the roles of nanoparticles in nanomedicine, particularly in cancer imaging and therapy. It shows how nanoparticle design (size, shape, surface functionalization) enables targeted drug delivery, enhances imaging (MRI, CT, PET, fluorescent labels), and supports therapies like photothermal, photodynamic, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and gene therapy.",

Nanostructured substrates have been reported to enhance local topographical interactions between substrates and targeted cell surfaces compared with flat substrates, which enhances cell capture affinity [63]. In addition, CTCs prefer nanostructured surfaces due to the similarity of the cell surface structure [28]. Different types of nanomaterials, such as nanostructured surfaces, quantum dots (QDs), magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), and polymers, which facilitate cellular attachment, have been reported for CTC detection. These nanomaterials have been demonstrated to improve the specificity and sensitivity of CTC capture devices and are expected to have a potential impact on cancer diagnosis and prognosis.",

The development of nanotechnology has provided new opportunities for integrating morphological and molecular information and for the study of the association between observed molecular and cellular changes with clinical-epidemiological data. Concerning specific approaches, bioconjugated quantum dots (QDs) [32.60-63] have been used to quantify multiple biomarkers in intact cancer cells and tissue specimens, allowing the integration of traditional histopathology versus molecular profiles for the same tissue [32.64-69]. Current interest is focused on the development of nanoparticles with one or multiple functionalities. For example, binary nanoparticles with two functionalities have been developed for molecular imaging and targeted therapy. Bioconjugated QDs, which have both targeting and imaging functions, can be used for targeted tumor imaging and for molecular profiling applications. \n\nNanoparticle material properties can be exploited to elicit clinical advantage for many applications, such as for medical imaging and diagnostic procedures. Iron oxide constructs and colloidal gold nanoparticles can provide enhanced contrast for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) imaging, respectively [32.70, 71]. QDs provide a plausible solution to the problems of optical in vivo imaging due to the tunable emission spectra in the near-infrared region, where light can easily penetrate through the body without harm and their inherent ability to resist bleaching [32.72]. For ultrasound imaging, contrast relies on impedance mismatch presented by materials that are more rigid or flexible than the surrounding tissue, such as metals, ceramics, or microbubbles [32.73]. Continued advancements of these nano-based contrast agents will allow clinicians to image the tumor environment with enhanced resolution for a deeper understanding of disease progression and tumor location. \n\nAdditional nanotechnologically-based detection and therapeutic devices have been made possible using photolithography and nucleic acid chemistry [32.74, 75].",

The D-A backbone structure endowed SPN@ RBCM with excellent NIR absorption and photothermal conversion ability, which showed excellent PAI and PTT efficacy both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, owing to its ultrasmall size, SPN@RBCM had significantly deep tumor penetration and could be cleared from the body without toxicity. Compared with previously reported semiconducting polymer nanoparticles, the most distinctive feature of our SPN@RBCM is the combination of a small-sized structure and RBCM camouflage, which reconciles the dilemma between prolonged blood circulation for tumor accumulation and rapid clearance from the body to reduce long-term toxicity.

The nanoparticles prepared from the blend of the three polymers had only one emission peak between 500-750 nm which was similar to that of CN-PPV SPNs and MEH-PPV SPNs, with its peak value shi\ue09ding between the peak values of the two red emitting polymer SPNs, and its emission width widening to cover both spectra. Moreover, although the presence of F8BT was suggested by the absorption spectra, there was no sign of the existence of the \ue104uorescence of F8BT in the nanoparticles prepared with low ratios of F8BT (which should appear as a second peak or a shoulder around l em \u00bc 536 nm), and there was only a small shoulder at that wavelength in the SPNs prepared with the highest F8BT ratio (i.e. 60 : 20 : 20 SPNs). F8BT is known to have a substantially higher \ue104uorescence quantum yield than MEH-PPV, 16 and the existence of only a small shoulder around its emission peak of 60 : 20 : 20 SPNs and its total disappearance, in the samples with lower F8BT  ratios, suggest that there was an interaction between F8BT and at least one of the other polymers.\n\nTo investigate if this behavior was due to the compact con\ue103guration of the three polymers in one nanoparticle or merely due to the existence of the polymers in separate nanoparticles in the same solution, mixtures of pre-synthesised MEH-PPV SPNs, F8BT SPNs, and CN-PPV SPNs with percentages similar to the ratios used in the F8BT:MEH-PPV:CN-PPV SPNs' synthesis were prepared and optically analyzed. Fig. 4C shows the absorption spectra of the mixture of the individual SPNs. The absorption spectra in the visible region were similar to those of the polyblend SPNs, however, they did not exhibit features associated with F8BT SPNs in the mixture except when their concentration in the mixture was dominating (i.e. 60% : 20% : 20% mixture).\n\nComparison of the emission spectra from the",

            "text": "Strong hydrophobic polymer required amphiphilic polymer to form a water-soluble nanoparticle by co-precipitation, thus leading to large size (34 nm) that could be unfavorable for efficient accumulation in tumor. To solve it, Pu et al. prepared an amphiphilic PPV polymer with grafted poly(ethylene glycol) that could self-assemble into smaller nanoparticles (24 nm) in aqueous solution (Xie et al., 2018). The nanoparticles were further doped with NCBS to form SPPVN-NCBS. Compared with SPN-NCBS, SPPVN-NCBS had smaller size, stronger NIR afterglow luminescence and higher accumulation in tumor. The NIR afterglow of SPPVN-NCBS could clearly detect 1 mm 3 xenografted tumors and invisible peritoneal metastatic tumors. \n\nIn a subsequent work, Pu et al. prepared a new library of afterglow luminescence agents by a generic approach that utilized an intraparticle cascade photoreaction of three main components (afterglow initiator, afterglow substrate and afterglow relay unit) (Jiang et al., 2019). By tuning the components, the afterglow emission could be adjusted from visible to NIR region. The representative NIR afterglow agents showed great imaging depth up to 5 cm, and permitted rapid detection of tumor in living mice with ultrahigh SBR (2,922 \u00b1 121). Recently, Ding et al. reported the first aggregation-induced emission (AIE)-based NIR afterglow probe (AGL AIE dot) that could persist over 10 days (Figure 6; Ni et al., 2018b). This afterglow probe exhibited deep tissue penetration, high SBR, and ultrahigh signal ratios of tumor-to-reticuloendothelial system (RES) organs, thereby having the capability of image-guided cancer surgery in living mice. As shown in Figure 6C, the NIR afterglow imaging of AGL AIE dot could clearly differentiate the microtumors in peritoneal carcinomatosis-bearing mice, but the fluorescence imaging failed to do it.",

In such, light scattering still cannot be ignored, although NIR-II fluorescence signals are recorded. To improve the deep tissue imaging quality and therapeutic efficiency, Fan et al demonstrated the application of 1064-nm activatable NIR-II FI-guided NIR-II PTT by using squaraine-based semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (PSQPNs-DBCO). 59 As mentioned above, Fan's group developed squaraine-based nanoparticles excited by a wavelength of 808 nm to achieve bright NIR-II FI and PTT. Based on this, squarainebased polymer (PSQP) with redshifted excitation and emission wavelength was further obtained by extending the conjugated length of semiconducting backbone. Waterdispersed nanoparticles (PSQPNs) were prepared by selfassembly process using amphiphilic DSPE-PEG 5000 -NH 2 , which were further modified with alkynyl groups on the nanoparticle surface to obtain PSQPNs-DBCO (Figure 5C). The PSQPNs-DBCO showed maximum emission peak at 1290 nm under 1064-nm laser excitation, making it possible for NIR-II-triggered NIR-II FI and therapy. As expected, PSQPNs-DBCO exhibited enhanced SNR by fourfold compared with the reported TT-3T CPs, which is a 808-nm light-responsive NIR-II fluorescence dye.",

Key materials for nanotheranostics include metallic nanoparticles, quantum dots, carbon dots, lipid nanoparticles and polymer-based nanocarriers, each offering unique benefits alongside specific challenges. Polymer-based nanocarriers, including hybrid and superparamagnetic nanoparticles, improve stability and functionality but are complex to manufacture. Polymeric nanoparticles with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) present promising theranostic potential for cancer detection and treatment. However, challenges such as translating the AIE concept to living systems, addressing toxicity concerns, overcoming deep-tissue imaging limitations, or ensuring biocompatibility remain to be resolved. Recently, cluster-triggered emission (CTE) polymers have emerged as innovative materials in nanotheranostics, offering enhanced fluorescence and biocompatibility. These polymers exhibit increased fluorescence intensity upon aggregation, making them highly sensitive for imaging and therapeutic applications. CTE nanoparticles, crafted from biodegradable polymers, represent a safer alternative to traditional nanotheranostics that rely on embedding conventional fluorophores or metal-based agents. This advancement significantly reduces potential toxicity while enhancing biocompatibility. The intrinsic fluorescence allows real-time monitoring of drug distribution and activity, optimizing therapeutic efficacy. Despite their potential, these systems face challenges such as maintaining stability under physiological conditions and addressing the need for comprehensive safety and efficacy studies to meet clinical and regulatory standards. Nevertheless, their unique properties position CTE nanoparticles as promising candidates for advancing theranostic strategies in personalized medicine, bridging diagnostic and therapeutic functionalities in innovative ways.",

Among a variety of fluorophores for phototheranostics, semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs), which are usually constructed by encapsulating hydrophobic semiconducting polymers (SPs) with amphiphilic copolymers, have shown great promise. As second near-infrared (NIR-II) fluorescence imaging has both higher imaging resolution and deeper tissue penetration compared with first near-infrared (NIR-I) fluorescence imaging, NIR-II fluorescent SPNs have been widely designed and prepared. Among numerous structural units for semiconducting polymers (SPs) synthesis, thiadiazoloquinoxaline (TQ) has been proved as an efficient electron acceptor unit for constructing NIR-II fluorescent SPs by reacting with proper electron donor units.

( 2017) described a semiconducting donor-acceptor electron conjugated polymer nanoparticles (PPor-PEG NPs) with a light harvesting device that was designed for highly efficient photoacoustic imaging and phototherapy [247]. In another research, Lyu et al. ( 2016) designed an intraparticle molecular orbital engineering strategy to simultaneously boost the efficacy of polymeric nanoparticles in phototherapy and photoacoustic brightness for cancer therapy and in vivo imaging. They demonstrated the use of the strengthened SPN as the theranostic nanoagents allow for better photoacoustic imaging [248].",

            "text": "Furthermore, the surface of inorganic nanoparticles is difficult to modify, thereby leading to the finite targeting ability. As an alternative, organic afterglow nanoparticles have attracted increasing interest due to their high biological safety, optical tunability, facile processability, and easy functionalization (An et al., 2015;Su et al., 2018). In 2015, Rao et al. reported the semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) with afterglow luminescence that can last for an hour (Palner et al., 2015). However, the underlying mechanism of the afterglow phenomenon remained unrevealed. To resolve it, Pu et al. screened a series of semiconducting polymers and discovered that only phenylenevinylene (PPV)-based SPNs such as BOPPV, MDMOPPV, and MEHPPV had distinct afterglow luminescence, implying its essential role in the production of afterglow luminescence (Figure 5A; Miao et al., 2017). According to series of characterizations and analyses, the probable mechanism of afterglow luminescence for PPV-based SPNs was proposed as follows: the singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ) was generated by the light irradiation of PPVs and then oxidized the vinylene bond to form an unstable PPV-dioxetane intermediate, which could spontaneously decompose into PPV-aldehyde fragments along with photonic efflux (Figure 5B). To amplify the afterglow of SPNs and red-shift it into NIR region, NCBS, a NIR dye (778 nm) and 1 O 2 photosensitizer, was doped into SPN-MEHPPV to yield SPN-NCBS. The afterglow of SPN-NCBS could be increased by 11-fold under pre-irradiation at 808 nm compared to 514 nm due to the higher 1 O 2 generation ability of NCBS vs. MEHPPV.",

For example, in endoscopy, surfaceenhanced Raman scattering NPs can increase the Raman signal intensity while combining with corresponding target ligands to diagnose early-stage tumors and differentiated lesion tissues; in tumor marker detection, gold NPs, silicon nanowires, and quantum dots can improve the sensitivity and accuracy of tumor marker detection in serum or tissue samples; and in tumor imaging, superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPION), gold NPs and nanoprobes play important roles in improving targeting, biocompatibility and bioavailability. [2,42] Gold NPs, magnetic NPs, quantum dots and TiO 2 NPs are expected to enhance the detection of circulating tumor cells in the blood and play a role in the diagnosis and prognosis of metastatic GC. [42] Nanomaterials have many advantages in phototherapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy and combination therapy for GC. The addition of nanomaterials improves the responsive release, tissue penetration depth and precise targeting of phototherapy, providing precise treatment for specific cancer tissues and cells through photodynamic therapy, photothermal therapy and combination therapy; multifunctional modified nanotechnology reduces the problems of poor solubility and bioavailability, systemic side effects and chemotherapeutic drug resistance development; the advantages of efficient loading and responsive release based on nanocarriers compensate for the insufficiently controlled release and drug resistance generation of targeted therapy; nanomaterials can be used in surgery navigation to clearly identify the location and the edge of the tumor, as well as metastatic lymph nodes for accurate resection [2,43]. The effectiveness of immune checkpoint blockade therapy cannot be significantly improved with the use of NPs as drug delivery carriers, but in combination with chemotherapy and other modalities, NPs can not only improve the efficiency of drug delivery and utilization but also enhance the anticancer immune response [44]. \n\nIn addition, the use of a variety of nanomaterials for the simultaneous diagnosis and treatment of GC has been reported.",

            "text": "It is suggested that particles with an SPR in the NIR-II optical window have a deeper tissue penetration and better sensitivity for early detection of tumour cells than those within NIR-I wavelength and visible light regions [21][22][23]. Therefore, this deeper penetration ability alongside minimal interaction with biological tissues, such as skin, fat, oxy-and deoxyhaemoglobin, an enhanced signal to noise ratio and a large maximum permissible exposure, make NIR-II a promising alternative to NIR-I for cancer imaging and ablation [24,25]. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), manufactured with a wide range of absorption spectrum in the NIR window [26,27], not only have an increased laser penetration due to increased tissue transparency to the electromagnetic spectrum (termed 'the optical window') but also increase the affordability of this theranostic agent due to its usage of a relatively low laser power [28]. In addition, due to their excellent physical and chemical properties of stability and biocompatibility, strong optical absorbance through SPR properties and suitability for surface functionalisation, gold nanoparticles of various size and shape have potential for widespread use in the detection and treatment of cancers [29,30]. \n\nGold nanoparticle shapes include spherical, nanorods, nanoshells, nanocages, tripods and tetrapods [31]. Jain and colleagues showed that although nanoshells and nanorods have a NIR plasmon resonance wavelength, which increases with increased diameter, size-normalised nanorods had a linear relationship with their aspect ratio (AR) and produced a great efficiency in diagnosis and therapy compared with both nanospheres and nanoshells [32]. Furthermore, small-sized AuNRs, compared with large-size AuNRs (with similar AR), have a much higher thermal stability and increased photoacoustic imaging signal in the NIR-II region [27]. Hence, AuNRs with an excitation wavelength at 1064 nm SPR in the NIR-II region have a stronger penetration of biological media and imaging quality compared with those in the NIR-I window [33].",

Silica nanoparticles are highly biocompatible and can be modified with various functional groups to improve PS loading and release (43). Quantum dots, semiconductor nanoparticles with sizetunable optical properties, can act as both PSs and imaging agents in PDT (44). Manganese dioxide (MnO 2 ) can stimulate the overproduction of hydrogen peroxide in tumor cells, resulting in the production of oxygen (48). Additionally, AuNCs act as intrinsic inorganic PSs that can induce ROS production, and the use of gold-based nanomedicines can enhance the effectiveness of other PSs in PDT due to the presence of a localized electric field (42,49).",

Cancer biomarkers may be proteins (secreted proteins or cell surface proteins) [15], carbohydrates [16], or nucleic acids (circulating tumor DNA, miRNA, etc.) [17] that are secreted by the body or cancer cells when cancer is present [18,19]. The measurement of certain cancer biomarker levels enables early detection of cancer or tumor recurrence and helps monitor the efficacy of the therapy. Nevertheless, the use of biomarkers has been limited by several barriers, including low biomarker concentrations in body fluids, heterogeneity in the abundance and timing of biomarkers within patients, and the difficulty in carrying out prospective studies [20]. Nanotechnology offers high selectivity and sensitivity and the ability to conduct simultaneous measurements of multiple targets. Biosensors can be improved with nanoparticles/nanomaterials to provide specific targeting [21]. In addition, the use of nanoparticles provides an increased surface-to-volume ratio, which makes biosensors more sensitive in fulfilling the demands of specific biomolecular diagnostics [22]. Quantum dots (QDs), gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), and polymer dots (PDs) are three common nanoparticle probes used in diagnosing cancer [23,24].",

In addition to serving as the photothermal agent, pillararene-capped CuS nanocages were 4\u00d7 more responsive and could control the release of DOX. \n\nSemiconducting polymer nanoparticles [SPNs) have also been used as photothermal agents [150][151][152]. Being made of organic compounds including semiconducting polymers/oligomers and amphiphilic polymers, SPNs possess natural biocompatibility, good photostability, and are easy to functionalize [152]. It has been reported that SPNs have relatively higher photothermal conversion efficacy in comparison with carbon nanotubes and gold nanorods. The photophysical properties of SPNs are correlated to the molecular structures of their precursor polymers, which allows versatility and diversity for tuning the optical spectra [153,154]. Xu et al. synthesized stable and size controllable SPNs, where DOX was loaded to perform chemotherapy. DOX was released from nanoparticles through multi-responsiveness to pH/NIR/GSH. With a combination of chemo-and photothermal therapies, the proposed SPNs nanosystem showed improved therapeutic efficacy both in vitro and in vivo. \n\nOrganic dyes can absorb optical energy and convert it into heat as well. Organic nanocarriers encapsulating organic dyes have been explored as complement for classic inorganic PTT, since they display good biocompatibility, biodegradability, and low longterm harmfulness. Liposomal nanocarriers are a popular delivery system for PTT [95,96]. Xiong et al. developed a NIR-triggered disintegrable liposomal nanoplatform which was modified with peptidyl ligands targeted to \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin receptors. The liposomes were loaded with ICG and a dendrimer-grafted cisplatin prodrug [19].",

A great challenge for in vivo fluorescence imaging is the autofluorescence and strong attenuation in visible light (400 nm\u223c650 nm) by biological matter, rendering deep tissue imaging all but impossible in this spectral region. erefore, using mostly established fluorescent nanoprobes such as inorganic quantum dots (QDs) [19], organic dyes [20], and semiconducting conjugated fluorescent polymers [21,22] with higher transparency in the near-infrared biological windows region (NIR, from 650 nm to 950 nm) has been developed extensively for deep tissue imaging applications. While compared with inherent disadvantages of QDs and organic dyes, such as photobleaching and potential toxicity [23][24][25], conjugated fluorescent polymers are highly demanded owing to their high brightness, low toxicity, stable fluorescent imaging, deeper tissue penetration, distinguishablility from autofluorescence [18,21,26]. erefore, uniting CT and fluorescence for bimodality imaging is an ideal technique that overcomes the shortcomings of each method alone and provides highresolutional/sensitive imaging of tissue and cells. Although the CT/fluorescence bimodality imaging can provide more accurate information for diagnosis, it is still a big challenge to develop facile methods to synthesize an all-in-one smart multifunctional nanoprobe for satisfied and effective CT/fluorescence bimodality imaging.\n\nHerein, we developed such kind of all-in-one multifunctional nanoparticles (Au@FP nanoparticles) by onestep solvent-mediated self-assembly method and then explored for its potentials as a contrast agent for both CT/ fluorescence imaging. e components of hydrophobic Au nanoparticles core, NIR emitting conjugated fluorescence polymers (PFBT and PFTBT), and amphiphilic PEGylated polymers are integrated into a single particle by rapid one-step synthesis (Scheme 1). e F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) strategy",

            "text": "The application of nanostructures in medicine and biomedical engineering has also been growing in recent years. Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)-based nanoparticles, or plasmonic nanoparticles, exhibit unique optical and thermal properties and have been extensively employed in biomedical applications [6][7][8][9][10][11]. Their major advantages are due to the photo physical properties of gold nanoparticles , for example, strong Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance (LSPR), surface-enhanced scattering , non-linear optical properties, tunable resonance across the Vis-NIR due to adjustable nanoparticle size and shape [12][13][14][15], biocompatibility due to their inert surface, nontoxicity, surface conjugation chemistry i.e., they can be linked to specific ligands for tumor targeting, imaging and therapies, lack of photo bleaching or blinking as with quantum dots, and very low oxidation [16,17]. The medical imaging modality employed for detection of malignant tumors in organs such as breast cancer should provide high-specificity to cancer and high resolution for early In situ detection [18]. Since, the main strength of PAI is its ability to obtain functional, anatomical and molecular information in real-time with a high resolution at clinically relevant depths, therefore either endogenous biomolecules such as hemoglobin, melanin and carotonoids or exogenous contrast agents such as indocyanine green [19], nanoparticles [20,21], nanoshells [22,23], nanorods [24,25], nanocages [26,27], and nanodiamonds [28] can be employed for image enhancement. However, as it will be discussed, for in vivo applications the nanostructures must be active targeted by conjugating them with suitable moieties e.g., antibodies, peptides or folates to prevent from protein adsorption and aggregation.",

Advanced imaging modalities, including computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and ultrasound (US), provide essential anatomical and functional information [1,2]. These techniques enable oncologists to assess tumor progression, monitor therapeutic responses, and guide interventions. However, traditional imaging methods face several challenges, including suboptimal contrast resolution, limited tissue differentiation, and potential risks associated with ionizing radiation. These limitations necessitate the development of novel imaging strategies that enhance sensitivity and specificity while minimizing adverse effects [3,4]. \n\nNanomaterials have emerged as promising agents for improving cancer imaging through enhanced contrast, targeted delivery, and multifunctional capabilities [5]. Their unique physicochemical properties enable selective tumor targeting and increased imaging sensitivity. Quantum dots (QDs), for instance, exhibit strong fluorescence properties, making them suitable for optical imaging [6]. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) enhance contrast in CT imaging due to their high X-ray attenuation coefficient [7]. Similarly, superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) serve as efficient contrast agents for MRI, improving signal intensity and tumor delineation [8]. The integration of nanomaterials in imaging platforms facilitates multimodal imaging, facilitating the combination of different imaging techniques for improved diagnostic accuracy. \n\nMonte Carlo (MC) simulations are widely used to model the interaction of nanoparticles with biological tissues, providing insights into light propagation, radiation dose distribution, and nanoparticle-mediated contrast enhancement [9]. These simulations enable precise predictions of nanoparticle behavior, optimizing their application in imaging and therapy. Figure 1 highlights the roles of nanoparticles in nanomedicine, particularly in cancer imaging and therapy. It shows how nanoparticle design (size, shape, surface functionalization) enables targeted drug delivery, enhances imaging (MRI, CT, PET, fluorescent labels), and supports therapies like photothermal, photodynamic, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and gene therapy.",

Among the approaches for exploiting nanotechnology in medicine, nanoparticles offer some unique advantages as sensing, image enhancement, and delivery agents. Several varieties of nanoparticles with biomedical relevance are available including, polymeric nanoparticles, metal nanoparticles, liposomes, micelles, quantum dots, dendrimers, and nano assemblies. To further the application of nanoparticles in disease diagnosis and therapy, it is important that the systems are biocompatible and capable of being functionalized for recognition of specific target sites in the body after systemic administration. \n\nNanoparticles based on gold chemistry have attracted significant research and practical attention recently. They are versatile agents with a variety of biomedical applications including use in highly sensitive diagnostic assays, thermal ablation and radiotherapy enhancement, as well as drug and gene delivery. For instance, antibody-modified gold nanoparticles when used for detection of prostate specific antigen, had an almost a million-fold higher sensitivity that conventional ELISAbased assay. Near-infrared radiation absorbing gold-silica nanoshells have been prepared and evaluated for thermal ablation of tumors after systemic administration. 35 r biomedical applications, surface functionalization of gold nanoparticles is essential in order to target them to specific disease areas and allow them to selectively interact with cells or biomolecules. Surface conjugation of antibodies and other targeting moieties is usually achieved by adsorption of the ligand to the gold surface. Surface adsorption, however, can denature the proteins or, in some cases, limit the interactions of the ligand with the target on the cell surface due to steric hinderance. Additionally, for systemic applications, long-circulating nanoparticles are desired for passive targeting to tumors and inflammatory sites. Poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG)modification of nanoparticles affords long circulating property by evading macrophage-mediated uptake and removal from the systemic circulation. 36",

            "text": "The concept of two-photon excitation is frequently used for imaging deeper in tissue. The process involves two photons of longer wavelengths of light (usually between 800 nm and 1600 nm) which are used to simultaneously excite a chromophore that typically absorbs shorter wavelengths of light approximately half the wavelength used for excitation. In doing so, longer wavelengths of light that preferentially penetrate tissue within the optical window become capable of exciting exogenous or endogenous chromophores at 10-to 100-fold greater tissue depths [15]. Although widely adopted for tissue imaging, some evidence exists for two-photon-excited deep-tissue PDT. In these applications, either a PS formulated into PNMs, or optically active nanoparticles (FRET donors for associated PS molecules) are directly excited using the two-photon process. PNMs that have been demonstrated to serve as efficient platforms for two-photon PDT include quantum dots [16], silica nanoparticles [17], gold nanoparticles [18], graphene carbon-based nanoparticles [19], and polymeric nanoparticles [20]. Although some preclinical in vitro and in vivo data has shown promise, a significant limitation of two-photon PDT is the high photon density required for the simultaneous excitation using two photons. This can only be achieved using focused laser light which serves to activate PNMs only within a focal volume of several \u00b5m 3 [21]. Given this extremely limited focal volume of excitation, the practicality of performing two-photon PDT for large and disseminated lesions in vivo remains in question. Figure 2. shows a schematic representation of the mechanisms underlying two-photon PDT as well as the process of generation of therapeutic reactive molecular species. Zhao et al. demonstrated that gold nanorods (AuNRs) with three different aspect ratios could serve as two-photon PDT agents without the need for additional organic PS molecules [15]. Although AuNRs exhibit low 1 O2 quantum yields (0.1%), the two-photon absorption cross-sections are of the order of 10 8 -fold higher than organic PSs, such as rose bengal (RB).",

Recently, a great variety of NIR dual-modality fluorescence and PA imaging contrast agents have been developed, such as activatable cyanine-based probes, 15 PEGylated semiconducting polymer nanoparticles, 16 indocyanine green (ICG)-conjugated mesoporous silica-coated gold nanobipyramids, 17 peptidefunctionalized carbon dots, 18 amorphous Ag 2-x Cu x S quantum dots, 19 and gold and dendritic mesoporous silica-encapsulated lanthanide-doped nanoparticles. 20 espite the tremendous efforts devoted to the development of theranostic agents and their exceptional imaging and therapeutic efficacy demonstrated, biocompatibility and biodegradability remain the most critical issues for in vivo clinical applications. 21,22 When the nanoparticles are administered intravenously, those smaller than 5 nm exhibit rapid renal excretion. 23 In comparison, the nanoparticles ranging from 5 to 200 nm have longer circulation times in the bloodstream before being captured by the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS). However, if the nanoparticle size exceeds 200 nm, they tend to be filtered out by the MPS in a relatively short time, leading to rapid accumulations in the liver and spleen. 24,25 It is worth noting that the nanoparticles between 30 and 200 nm can be trapped in the tumor lesions with the help of the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. 26,27 To be fully removed from the organism after carrying out their functionalities, the biodegradation of the nanoparticles into excretable molecules or ions can help reduce chronic toxicity. 28,29",

Advances in these areas will undoubtedly form the major cornerstones for a future medical practice of personalized oncology. Cancer detection, diagnosis, and therapy will be tailored to each individual's tumor molecular profile and used in predictive oncology, whereby genetic/molecular markers will play an essential role in the prediction of disease development, progression, and clinical outcomes. The probability of a successful treatment modality increases dramatically if tumor cells can be selectively removed before they evolve to their mature stages and metastases production. As such, novel and more sensitive diagnostic tools like metallic and semiconducting nanoparticles are being developed with the aim of improving the early and noninvasive detection of rising malignancies and the accuracy of tumor tissue localization. Paramagnetic nanoparticles, quantum dots, nanoshells and nanosomes represent some of these new technologies, used for diagnostic purposes (See Figure 4). Compared to conventional materials, inorganic nanomaterials provide several advantages such as simple preparative processes and precise control over their shape, composition and size. These systems provide promising potential not only in diagnostics, but also as delivery systems for therapeutic agents and are discussed in detail below. Fig. 4.

PTT agents can enhance the efficiency of localized light-based heating and ablation of tumor tissues and, at the same time, reduce adverse effects. \n\nHigh-performance photo-converted energy-converting biomaterials (H-ECBs) produce heat to kill specific cells, not requiring oxygen to interact with the target cells or tissues, as in photodynamic therapy. The longer the light wavelength, the less energetic and less harmful to healthy cells and tissues surrounding the tumors [34]. Once irradiated, the PTT agents absorb photons' energy, migrating from the ground singlet state to an excited singlet state. As it returns to the ground state, the so-called vibrational relaxation promotes collisions between the excited PPT agents which, in turn, collide with molecules surrounding their microenvironment. As a result, the temperature increases due to the increased kinetic energy [30]. Critical conditions for PTT success are the adequate spectral range, attaining the peak absorption wavelength of the photosensitive agent used in the treatment, and the tissue-penetration depth that can reach the target while reducing the power loss to a minimum [30].",

            "text": "Gold nanoparticles (including nanoshells, nanorods, nanostars, etc.) represent a well-known class of photoactive nanoagents that can be applied in photothermal therapy (PTT) of cancer and other diseases [1][2][3][4]. Due to the phenomenon of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) [5], spherical gold nanoparticles (NPs) in colloidal suspensions display a specific red color that corresponds to a characteristic absorption band peaked at ~520-530 nm. The advantages of plasmonic gold nanospheres over anisotropic nanostructures comprise generally simple synthesis, narrow size distribution and, especially, higher thermodynamic stability [6]. Gold NPs-based phototherapeutic agents were demonstrated to produce efficient PTT effects both in vitro and in vivo [1][2][3][4]. The LSPR band position can be shifted upon association (aggregation) of gold NPs: It leads to the formation of a new absorption band at longer wavelengths as a result of electric dipole-dipole interaction and coupling between the plasmons of neighboring particles in the formed aggregates [7][8][9][10]. In turn, a shift of the absorption of the aggregated gold nanoparticles towards the near-infrared (NIR) region allows for utilization of NIR light (which is known to deeper penetrate biological tissues due to lesser absorption and scattering) for induction or enhancement of photothermal effects [11]. On the other hand, NIR plasmonic absorbance for photothermal therapy can be achieved by using anisotropic gold nanoparticles (e.g., nanorods, nanocages, nanoshells, nanostars, etc. [4,12,13], or hybrid (composite) nanostructures that comprise gold with other materials [14][15][16]. Due to higher intrinsic NIR absorbance and photothermal transfer ability of gold-based anisotropic nanoparticles, they showed promising preliminary results in PTT applications.",

            "text": "Recently, a new gold nanostructure, named the gold beltflower (GBF), was reported by Chen and colleagues, further demonstrating the importance of nanostructure design in photothermal conversion efficiency determination [125]. This GBF contained multiple (>10) branched petals (10 nm in thickness) with long narrow gaps (1-2 nm) between adjacent petals, and a hollow cavity with a wide opening from the conical tip to the scraggly bottom side. Due to the small thickness of the individual petals and the narrow gaps between them, the LSPR of GBFs is greatly enhanced, as evidenced by an ultrahigh photothermal conversion efficiency (74%). Upon intratumoral injection, their presence in the tumor could be clearly visualized via PA tomography as the generated PA signal could be amplified by their bell-shaped structure. Five minutes tumor irradiation with an 808 nm laser (0.5 W/cm 2 ) was sufficient to achieve complete tumor ablation, while only partial inhibition was observed for gold nanorod treated tumors. \n\nConventional hollow gold nanoshells and gold nanorods for PTT of tumors are not particularly effective in tumor imaging. Consequently, many additional imaging modalities have been integrated into gold nanoparticles to create multifunctional LTNs. One strategy to construct such an LTN is using nano-sized contrast agents as a core on which to grow a gold shell. For instance, single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT, a SERS probe) [126] and IONP [127][128][129][130] have been used to create LTNs that could be used for SERS-or MRI-guided PTT. In contrast to this strategy that introduces additional imaging modalities into the core of gold nanoparticles, another strategy introduces the additional imaging modalities onto the surface instead. In one example, a Raman probe (4-methylbenzenethiol) was conjugated onto the surface of a gold shell, realizing SERS-guided tumor margin determination and localized PTT [131].",

            "text": "Rapidly expanding field of image-guided surgery needs new materials for near-infrared imaging with deep tissue penetration, high brightness and good stability.With the development of nanotechnology, fluorescence nanomaterials, especially with emission in range of nearinfrared spectrum provide excellent candidates for real-time monitoring of surgical procedures with high spatio-temporal resolution and sensitivity [11].Inorganic nanomaterials, such as semiconductor quantum dots, lanthanide-doped upconversion nanoparticles and noble-metal nanoparticles, exhibited outstanding photostability and brightness, presenting great opportunities for longer-term in vivo tracking and imaging.Unfortunately, most fluorescent inorganic nanoparticles are composed of highly toxic heavy metal cations, which raises the concerns of long-term toxicity and limits the further clinical transition [12].In terms of biocompatibility, the organic nanodots derived from the nanoaggregate of luminescent small molecule or polymers are generally considered more favorable than the inorganic nanoparticles [13].However, these organic nanodots suffer from a fundamental problem: the molecules or polymers are packed together so closely that they can be affected by aggregation caused quenching, in which most of the energy coming from the original light source is quickly dissipated and fails to trigger fluorescence.As a result, the brightness of as-prepared organic nanoparticles tends to decrease along with the increase of molecules or polymers doping concentration, which presents a dilemma for fabricating highly bright and photostable organic nanoparticles.A fundamental solution was pioneered in 2001, Tang et al proposed an aggregation-induced emission (AIE) conception.The luminogens with AIE property (AIEgens) are non-emissive in solutions but become highly fluorescent upon aggregate formation because the restriction of the intramolecular rotations (RIR), which make them ideal candidate materials for preparation of highly bright and photostable organic fluorescent nanoparticles.Since the first report of development of organic dots with aggregation-induced emission (AIE dots) for bioimaging, numerous reports suggest that these biocompatible highly bright nanoparticles have the potential to improve conventional therapeutic and imaging capability for disease detection and treatment [14][15][16][17][18]).",

            "text": "Traditional clinical imaging techniques hardly meet the demands of individualized cancer diagnosis because of the growing trend toward the advancement of accurate diagnosis of diseases, especially cancer. These traditional techniques, such as positron emission tomography (PET), computed tomography (CT), X-ray, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are hampered by impaired target specificity and limited information on the lesion location [1][2][3] . Nanocarrierbased molecular imaging systems, with their leaky tumor vasculature and poor lymphatic drainage, have received much attention to address these issues, because these systems provide an opportunity to enhance the target specificity for tumor tissue 2,4,5 . \n\nNanoparticles are particulate materials with at least one dimension in the range of 1\u2212100 nm. These particles have high surface-to-volume ratio, high surface energy, and unique mechanical, thermal, electrical, magnetic, and optical behaviors 6,7 , which are not found in their bulk counterparts. These properties make the nanoparticles especially suitable for a wide range of applications in medicine. Nanomedicine involves the solution of various medical challenges and drawbacks faced by conventional medicine. These challenges include poor bioavailability, impaired target specificity, and systemic and organ toxicity 8 . Tumor tissues form leaky vasculatures and have poor lymphatic drainage around these tissues. Nanoparticles possess unique optical effect, electricity properties, and magnetic effects which has led to the extensive studies on the development of \"nanoprobes\" for molecular imaging. For example, superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) and ultrasmall SPIO (USPIO) are used for MRI 9 , gold nanoparticles for CT 10 , quantum dots (QDs) 11 and upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) 12 for optical imaging, and carbon nanotubes and gold nanorods for photoacoustic contrast. \n\nMuch detailed information is highly needed for the accurate diagnosis of diseases. However, one single-imaging modality cannot provide complete information. PET, singlephoton emission computed tomography (SPECT), and optical techniques, which produce images with detailed information, have high sensitivity but with poor resolution 13,14 .",

            "text": "Colon cancer is the third most common cancer diagnosed in the United States [1]. Colon cancer management depends on the stage of the tumor. The classic therapeutic strategies for most cancers depend on the stage and the degree of the tumor. Classical cancer diagnostic techniques are very expensive and have their limitations [2]. Optical imaging is a noninvasive and inexpensive technology. Optical imaging uses light to probe cellular and molecular function in cancer detection. Since cancerous cells have altered blood flow and are highly hypoxic, differential optical absorbances of oxy-and deoxyhemoglobin in the cancerous and normal cells have been used as an indicator for the cancer tissue (Scheme 1) [3]. Near-infrared (NIR) imaging is a powerful diagnostic method with the potential to serve as a nonionizing technique for sensitive, deep tissue diagnostic imaging due to its long wavelengths compared to ultraviolet (UV) [4,5]. Defining the tumor location by optical contrast agents allows the physician to better distinguish between normal and cancerous tissue [3]. Contrast-enhanced NIR imaging increases the sensitivity and the specificity of cancer detection. Nanoparticles used for NIR imaging such as NIR-emitting semiconductor quantum dots (QDs), resonant gold nanoshells, and dye-encapsulating nanoparticles have several limitations [4].",

            "text": "Semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (Pdots or SPNs) have recently generated tremendous interests as a novel class of contrast agents for biological imaging [74]. They exhibit several important virtues such as their extraordinary fluorescence brightness, fast emission rate, excellent photostability, and nonblinking and nontoxic features [75][76][77][78][79][80][81]. In particular, we recently developed several influential approaches for introducing functional groups, controlling the surface chemistry of Pdots, and employing these novel nanoparticle probes for cellular labeling and in vivo imaging [82][83][84]. These superior properties of Pdots over other fluorescent probes have established their enormous potential in biology and medicine as highly bright in vitro and in vivo probes. \n\nPu et al. have developed a new class of near-infrared SPN probes for in vivo photoacoustic molecular imaging [24]. SPN can generate stronger signals than SWCNTs or GNRs on a per mass basis, permitting whole-body lymph node photoacoustic mapping in living mice at a low systemic injection mass. Semiconducting polymers have been originally developed for a wide variety of optoelectronic devices. These purely organic SPNs for PAT have a unique set of advantages that derive from the light-harvesting polymers including the large mass extinction coefficients and excellent photostability. These merits make SPNs superior PAT probes for generating strong and photostable photoacoustic signals in the near-infrared region when compared to SWCNT and GNR. At the same mass concentration, the intrinsic photoacoustic amplitude of the SPN at 700 nm can be over five times higher than that from SWCNT or GNR (Figure 5). Such high photoacoustic brightness in combination with its favorable size enables the efficient PAT of major lymph nodes in living mice with high sensitivity after a single intravenous administration of a small amount of SPNs.",

As SPNs are fabricated from biologically inert organic compounds, they can inherently avoid of heavy metal ion-induced toxicity to tissues and thus possess good biocompatibility [19]. However, narrowing their absorption bandgap within the near-infrared light (NIR) window along with a high extinction coefficient is challenging but essentially needed, which may facilitate efficient NIR photothermal conversion for PAI and PTT [20]. In addition, similar to other nano-scaled biomaterials, artificial phototheranostic nanoagents generally encounter several obstacles in clinical translation, including easy recognition by the immune system, insufficient accumulation in the tumor site, and safety concerns regarding physiological interactions and metabolism, which compromise their potential for clinical practice [21,22].",

SPNs are designed to improve the sensitivity and resolution of PAI because of the tunable optical properties, high absorption coefficients and high photostability of this material [51]. In 2019, through reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization of polystyrene-b-poly (Nisopropylacrylamide-co-acrylic acid) (PSNiAA), Xu's team prepared a functional nanoparticles (PDPP3T@PSNiAA) with photothermal sensitivity and PA response [52]. Anti-cancer drug Doxorubicin (Dox) was also loaded onto these NPs by electrostatic interaction and formed PDPP3T@PSNiAA-Dox NPs. The data showed that all PDPP3T@PSNiAA-Dox NPs at different concentrations had a time-dependent increasing laser irradiation response. The temperature of the NPs could still increase to the same level even up to the fourth laser-cooling circle, indicating the photothermal stability of PDPP3T@PSNiAA-Dox NPs. Additionally, experiments for the PA properties of these NPs conducted in vitro showed that the maximum intensity of PDPP3T@PSNiAA NPs was at 785 nm, and the higher concentration of NPs contributed to higher PA signals. The in vivo experiments indicated that these PDPP3T@PSNiAA-Dox NPs could accumulate in tumor region over time (Figure 7). A burst intracellular Dox release occurred with NIR irradiation at acidic condition (80%), while it was below 40% at neutral condition, which could minimize the release of the drug in normal tissues. In vivo studies on HeLa tumor-bearing mice showed that tumors of PDPP3T@PSNiAA-Dox NPs with laser treatment were effectively eliminated without reoccurrence, while groups treated with free Dox (with and without laser) and NPs without laser showed none or minor tumor elimination.",

            "text": "In the visible spectral region, functionally specific targeting and imaging have been demonstrated using semiconductor nanoparticles [1]. Using visible fluorescent tags, however, deep organs such as the liver and the spleen could not be detected because of the limited penetration depth of visible light. Deep-tissue imaging requires the use of infrared light within a spectral window separated from the major absorption peaks of hemoglobin and water. Infrared optical imaging of living tissue is therefore an area of growing interest, for example to provide improved tumor-sensitivity. High-transparency spectral bands in the near infrared region enable depths of detection of 5-10 cm, a capability that provides surgeons with direct infrared visual guidance throughout a sentinellymph-node mapping procedure, minimizing incision and dissection inaccuracies and permitting real-time confirmation of complete resection [2]. \n\nInfrared light-emitting diodes based on nanoparticles have the potential to offer low manufacturing cost, compatibility with a range of substrates and quantum-size-effect tunability. They can be integrated on CMOS-processed silicon electronics in chipto-chip and board-to-board optical interconnections and in fiber-optic and optical wireless communications. Large-area infrared emitters for biomedical imaging would enable optical diagnosis in near infrared biological transparency windows [3]. \n\nPhotoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy is a powerful technique for investigating semiconducting and semi-insulating nanoparticles [4]. We apply infrared PL to study the relative PL quantum efficiency and the thermal stability of PbS nanoparticles prepared in the form of thin layers by the Langmuir-Blodgett and laser ablation methods on glass substrates.",

            "text": "Among the various noninvasive techniques to achieve deep tissue penetration, ultrasound is widely recognized as an efficient biomedical diagnostic imaging modality in hospitals due to its inherent deep-penetration properties (e.g., < 20 cm) [173,174]. It has been extensively utilized in clinics to provide valuable information of internal body structures such as muscles, tendons, joints, vessels, organs, and practice of examining pregnant women with obstetric ultrasound for prenatal care in recent decades [175,176]. Recently, a brand-new technique, PA imaging, which integrates NIR light excitation and ultrasound imaging into one system, has been developed as a new kind of imaging modality to provide deep-tissue penetration and strong PA signals from endogenous or exogenous contrast agents with high resolution in living systems [177,178]. As shown in Figure 9A, upon laser irradiation, a part of light is absorbed by the contrast agents and converted to localized heat, followed by the generation of a pressure rise through thermo-elastic expansion. Such pressure rise is propagated as an acoustic wave with the ultrasound frequency in the biological tissues, which can be captured by surrounding ultrasonic transducers for PA imaging in deep-seated regions [179]. Therefore, due to these promising properties, PA imaging may overcome the limitations of conventional optical imaging (e.g., limited tissue penetration depth) and ultrasonic imaging (e.g., low contrast for diagnosis), making it an outstanding clinical imaging method in biomedical fields [180,181]. Moreover, benefited from the great absorption of NIR light, various photothermal regents as aforementioned also can be utilized as ideal contrast agents for PA imaging [182][183][184]. For example, a promising semiconducting conjugated polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) that have strong NIR light absorbance have been reported recently, which could act as a new class of contrast agents for PA imaging ( Figure 9B) [185]. These SPNs exhibited considerable PA signal than gold nanorods and SWNTs on a per mass basis, and could make them an ideal contrast agent for whole-body lymphnode PA imaging in living mice. Chen's group also constructed a novel multimodality imaging nano",

By using this technique, exosomal EpCAM and CD24 were stably probed, and were demonstrated the ability to differentiate ovarian cancer patients (n=20) from non-cancer patients (n=10). \n\nIn another work, Hu and co-workers 66 built a nanoplasmon-enhanced scattering (nPES) assay to directly probe the membrane antigens from tumour-derived EVs, in which the detection antibody-conjugated gold nanospheres (50 nm) and nanorods (25\u00d760 nm) were bind to EVs, which were captured by antibodies pre-decorated glass chip to form the \"sandwich\" format, producing a local plasmon effect that enhances tumour-derived EV detection sensitivity and specificity (Figure 2B). The unique plasmonic color of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and gold nanorods (AuNRs) allows the duplexed profiling of EV membrane marker, and their coupling caused red shift and color change can indicate the co-existence of the membrane antigens. They leveraged the Image J to analyze batches of DFM images. The method can automatically selected image areas with a brightness value of 255. After identifying these areas, the software calculated the ratios between the selected areas and the total areas of the images. These ratios were used as a metric for the specific nPES EV signal. In their study, the authors demonstrated that nanoplasmonenhanced scattering assay could effectively distinguish early-stage pancreatic cancer from pancreatitis and controls in a cohort of 155 subjects. However, the assay capacity for high-throughput surface marker profiling is limited considering the proximity of surface antigens and the steric hindrance of AuNPs and AuNRs during recognition and binding to the exosomal surface. \n\nGooding group 67 developed a core-satellite formation of Au nanoparticles (i.e., 67 nm-AuNP-analyte-enzyme coated 10 nm-AuNP) for the detection of interleukin 6 (IL-6).",

Among the approaches for exploiting nanotechnology in medicine, nanoparticles offer some unique advantages as sensing, image enhancement, and delivery agents. Several varieties of nanoparticles with biomedical relevance are available including, polymeric nanoparticles, metal nanoparticles, liposomes, micelles, quantum dots, dendrimers, and nanoassemblies. To further the application of nanoparticles in disease diagnosis and therapy, it is important that the systems are biocompatible and capable of being functionalized for recognition of specific target sites in the body after systemic administration. \n\nNanoparticles based on gold chemistry have attracted significant research and practical attention recently. They are versatile agents with a variety of biomedical applications including use in highly sensitive diagnostic assays, thermal ablation and radiotherapy enhancement, as well as drug and gene delivery. For instance, antibody-modified gold nanoparticles when used for detection of prostate specific antigen, had an almost a million-fold higher sensitivity that conventional ELISAbased assay. Near-infrared radiation absorbing gold-silica nanoshells have been prepared and evaluated for thermal ablation of tumors after systemic administration [35]. \n\nFor biomedical applications, surface functionalization of gold nanoparticles is essential in order to target them to specific disease areas and allow them to selectively interact with cells or biomolecules. Surface conjugation of antibodies and other targeting moieties is usually achieved by adsorption of the ligand to the gold surface. Surface adsorption, however, can denature the proteins or, in some cases, limit the interactions of the ligand with the target on the cell surface due to steric hinderance. Additionally, for systemic applications, longcirculating nanoparticles are desired for passive targeting to tumors and inflammatory sites. Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-modification of When placed in an external field, each MNP creates a local magnetic field, which increases the field inhomogeneity.",

However, MR imaging still suffers from low sensitivity. 21 To obtain high-resolution and sensitive diagnostic information, the development trend of MR imaging-based molecular imaging technology has developed from a single-mode imaging system to a dual-mode or multimode imaging system. [22][23][24] For instance, many imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT), positron-emission tomography (PET), ultrasonic imaging and FL imaging have been combined with MR imaging to develop dual-modal or multimodal imaging systems. 25 Among them, the combination of MR/FL dual-modal imaging has captured great interest because these imaging techniques can offer the advantages of improving the relatively poor sensitivity of MR imaging and overcoming the detection depth and resolution limits of FL imaging.\n\nIn this context, theranostic nanoplatforms with MR/FL dual-modal imaging have been developed by integrating MR and FL imaging contrast agents into nanoparticles.

The unique optical properties of many nanomaterials make them ideal for biosensing. Colloidal fluorescent and plasmonic nanoparticles are particularly interesting, as they produce intense responses to incident light, and linking this response to the presence of a target analyte yields extremely sensitive detection in solution. Optimization of nanoparticle biosensors by considering the nanoparticle core, surface, and sensing properties, with an eye toward their application in research and as clinical tools. This translational process relies on the availability of high-quality nanoparticles with precisely engineered surfaces and biosensing mechanisms that allow detection with high sensitivity and specificity. Advances Much research has centered on fluorescent quantum dots (QDs) and plasmonic gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and has expanded to include carbon dots, silicon dots, upconverting nanoparticles, alloyed plasmonic nanoparticles, and gold and silver nanoclusters, among a constantly growing repertoire. New tools for probing the nucleation and growth of nanoparticles, such as in situ synchrotron x-ray irradiation, liquid cell transmission electron microscopy, and computer simulation, are revealing ever more about fundamental processes\u2014for example, the importance of particle coalescence and surface ligand conformation during particle growth. Precision engineering of particle surfaces is required to construct advanced nanoparticle biosensors, and this is being facilitated by a new generation of modular small-molecule and polymeric capping agents, the incorporation of new high-yield bio-orthogonal \u201cclick\u201d-like functional groups, and advanced engineering of biomolecular sensing constructs (e.g., by recombinant protein engineering). Notable successes in the field include the precision synthesis of nanoparticles in microfluidic systems; ultrasensitive detection of cancer biomarkers in human serum with time-gated QD fluorescence; multiplexed intracellular sensing of mRNA using superquenching AuNPs; multiplexed detection of analytes with simple technologies such as smartphones; in vivo sensing of reactive oxygen",

A polymer coating can make inorganic nanoparticles soluble in many solvents as individual particles and not only do low molar mass solvents become suitable, but also polymers as a solid matrix. In the case of shape anisotropic particles (e.g., rods) a spontaneous self-organization (parallel orientation) of the nanoparticles can be achieved, because of the formation of lyotropic liquid crystalline phases. They offer the possibility to orient the shape of anisotropic nanoparticles macroscopically in external electric fields. At least, such hybrid materials allow semiconducting inorganic nanoparticles to be dispersed in functional polymer matrices, like films of semiconducting polymers. Thereby, the inorganic nanoparticles can be electrically connected and addressed by the polymer matrix. This allows LEDs to be prepared with highly fluorescent inorganic nanoparticles (quantum dots) as chromophores.

Insights into the interaction of the imaging probes with the biological targets from single cell to whole organ are obtained by transient absorption (TA) microscopy and photoacoustic (PA) tomography. At single-cell level, TA microscopy reveals the targeting efficiency, kinetics, and specificity of BTII-DUPA SPN to PSMA-positive prostate cancer. At organ level, PA tomographic imaging of BTII-DUPA SPN in the NIR-II window demonstrates superior imaging depth and contrast. By intravenous administration, BTII-DUPA SPN demonstrates selective accumulation and retention in the PSMA-positive tumor, allowing noninvasive PA detection of PSMA overexpressing prostate tumors in vivo.

            "text": "However, it cannot be directly used in aqueous environments due to the limitation of water solubility and stability of peroxalate, which can be overcome by integrating POCL reagents in nanoparticles. Semiconductor polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) not only have high brightness and excellent photostability, but are also inert to ROS and can therefore be used as versatile nanoplatforms for the development of in vivo mouse ROS imaging probes [81]. Zhen et al. carried out energy level modulation by combining polyfluorene-based SPs with various molecular orbitals with peroxalate luminous substrates (TCPO), which is crucial for encouraging intermolecular electron transfer and CL augmentation during H 2 O 2 -driven luminescence (Figure 5b) [79]. The H 2 O 2 -activated luminescence of SPN was found to be primarily governed by the energy interval between the HOMO of SP and the LUMO of the high-energy intermediate dioxetanedione. The CL quantum yield (QY) and LOD of the optimized SPN were significantly better than those of the previous probes. Furthermore, the SPN could be co-doped with 2,3-naphthalocyanine dyes into nanoparticles to form a CRET to produce NIR luminescence (775 nm), which has been effective in imaging H 2 O 2 at extremely low levels in living mice. \n\nIn addition, an enhanced NIR POCL signal can be obtained by a 'nanophotonic energy relay' approach [82], which did not require an emitter structure to meet the energy-matching requirement. The aggregation-induced emission (AIE)-active POCL nanoparticle was constructed by dense nano-integration of multiple molecules, including low-bandgap conjugated polymers with AIE effects as NIR emitters, peroxalate as a chemical fuel in response to inflammatory H 2 O 2 , and energy-gap-bridging photonic molecules. The energy-gapbridging photonic molecules have been shown to efficiently accept energy from peroxalate chemically excited intermediates and relay it to the NIR emitter.",

The corresponding SERS spectra extracted from these regions of interest confirm the presence of PD-L1 and EGFR targeted AuNS distribution, as illustrated in \n\nBelhout et al. utilized polystyrene beads functionalized with lipoic acid, which were then loaded with 4-20% citrate capped AuNPs. The nanocomposite exhibited a notable redshift in the absorption spectra, attributed to the reduced average interparticle distance within the polymer matrix. Importantly, the magnitude of enhancement in SERS signal intensity was found to be influenced by the size of the AuNPs [184]. In another study, Serrano-Montes et al. showed that hybrid nanomaterials from polystyrene beads and AuNSt showed improved SERS response and SERS bioimaging of living A549 cells using 4-mercapto pyridine as a Raman reporter [185]. Despite the high sensitivity of SERS probes, the Raman intensity experiences significant attenuation while passing through tissue due to scattering. Researchers sought to enhance tissue penetration by combining deep Raman spectroscopy with surfaceenhanced, spatially offset Raman spectroscopy (SESORS), which resulted in a remarkable improvement, increasing the penetration depth from less than 5.5 mm to 25 mm thickness [186]. To further reduce tissue scattering, the use of Raman reporters in the NIR range was explored, and gold nanostructures like AuNRs proved to be beneficial in this regard. Maltzahn et al. employed nanorods coated with SERS-active molecules, enabling unique in vivo distinction over a spectral sharp bandwidth of 6 nm in the NIR, much smaller than that of semiconductor quantum dots (QDs), organic fluorochromes, and Raleigh scattering nanoparticles.",

QDs are fluorescent 2-10 nm nanocrystals that can be used as alternative probes for a host of diagnostic, therapeutic, and theranostic applications in medical and surgical oncology. 14 Their broad absorption and narrow symmetric emission spectra, large molar extinction coefficients, high quantum yield, and enhanced photostability give them tremendous advantages over traditional fluorophores for biomolecular and cellular imaging in vitro and in vivo. 15 QDs can be size-tuned to emit at near-infrared (NIR, 650-1,000 nm) wavelengths, which are ideal for deep tissue imaging because the biological window is transparent to these wavelengths. This is based on the fact that tissue chromophores like hemoglobin absorb light in the visible spectrum (400-700 nm), leading to scattering, diffraction, and poor penetration through the skin.",

            "text": "Similarly, polymer-based nanocarriers have emerged as promising nanocarriers for drug delivery. The progress on polymer chemistry has allowed the development of new polymer structures with multi-faceted and highly adjustable properties, advancing the development of nanosized micelles, solid-core nanoparticles, polymersomes and dendrimers (11). These carriers have tunable characteristics, defined by the physicochemical properties of the used polymer or combination of polymers, capable of delivering unstable hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds, or molecules that otherwise would not be capable of crossing the cell membrane, such as nucleic acids (i.e., si/miRNAs and plasmids). \n\nFinally, inorganic nanoparticles are frequently composed of magnetic iron oxide, silica oxide and gold, among other materials. Similar to the other categories, the inorganic nanoparticles can be surface-modified to achieve long-circulating properties, actively target specific cells and tissues, and protect active compounds. Furthermore, inorganic nanoparticles, such as iron oxide/magnetic nanoparticles, can respond to external stimuli, such as magnetism, which permits their detection or active targeting to specific parts of the body, or demonstrate unique optical properties for improved in vivo imaging, such as quantum dots and up-converting nanoparticles, which lipids and polymers cannot provide (35)(36)(37). \n\nThe efficacy of nanodelivery in different tumors largely varies, guided by the variable tumor vascular characteristics, such as vessel architecture, interstitial fluid and extracellular matrix composition, phagocyte infiltration and presence of necrotic areas. Parameters, such as the extravasation of the nanoparticles from tumor blood vessels, their diffusion through the extracellular tissue and their interaction with the tumor microenvironment constitute the EPR effect, elegantly analyzed by Bertrand et al. (23). The EPR effect in solid tumors was initially described \u223c3 decades ago, and was one of the driving forces for the scientific advancements taking place in the field of nanotechnology.",

            "text": "The miniaturization of imaging techniques has the potential to revolutionize PA imaging of deep tissue structures through internal illumination of light, greatly expanding its clinical capabilities. \n\nGiven these recent developments, further research is imperative, focusing on sources, detectors, materials, and applications to utilize the full potential of PA in biomedical imaging. PA imaging presents a powerful biomedical imaging modality with several unique advantages. It combines the high resolution of optical imaging with the deeper tissue penetration of ultrasound, enabling visualization of anatomical structures, physiological processes, and molecular signatures within living organisms. However, translating the promise of PA imaging into routine clinical applications requires overcoming certain challenges associated with nanoparticle contrast agents. \n\nA critical challenge lies in ensuring the biocompatibility of PA nanoparticles. Ideally, these agents should be non-toxic, readily cleared from the body after use, and avoid triggering unwanted immune responses. Manohar et al. explored strategies for surface modification of gold nanorods to enhance biocompatibility and reduce aggregation within the body [192]. Liang et al. demonstrated the use of antibody-conjugated carbon nanotubes for targeted PA imaging of tumors, highlighting the potential of targeted approaches [193]. The efficacy of PA nanostructures and nanomaterials primarily relies on their ability to efficiently convert absorbed light energy into acoustic waves. This necessitates careful selection of materials with strong light absorption at wavelengths that can penetrate deep into tissues. Traditional NIR absorbing agents, like gold nanorods, offer good penetration but mostly suffer from limited absorption efficiency. Recently, research by Zha et al. explored novel organic photoacoustic contrast agents with tailored NIR absorption properties for deeper tissue imaging [194]. Developing a broader library of PA nanoparticles with optimized light absorption characteristics remains an active area of research. While PA imaging boasts superior resolution compared to traditional ultrasound, achieving high spatial resolution with deep tissue penetration remains a critical challenge. Factors like limited bandwidth of ultrasound detectors and the scattering of acoustic waves by tissues can compromise image quality. \n\nResearch by Zhang et al. investigated photoacoustic microscopy techniques that utilize focused laser beams and high-frequency ultrasound detectors to achieve micrometer-scale resolution for pre-clinical studies [195].",

            "text": "Cancer surgery has long been a cornerstone of treatment for solid tumors, yet it is often fraught with challenges such as incomplete resection, damage to healthy tissues, and difficulty in distinguishing tumor margins. Advances in nanotechnology are revolutionizing cancer surgery, offering precision tools that improve visualization, target cancer cells specifically, enhance postoperative recovery, and reduce adverse effects. Nanotechnology's role in improving cancer surgery spans tumor detection, drug delivery, and the development of novel intraoperative therapies like photothermal and photodynamic therapy (PDT) [1] . \n\nOne of the key applications of nanotechnology in cancer surgery is enhancing tumor imaging for better intraoperative guidance. Standard imaging methods like MRI, CT, and ultrasound lack the resolution to detect small or diffuse tumors. Nanoparticles (NPs), owing to their unique magnetic and optical properties, have emerged as potent contrast agents that significantly improve imaging sensitivity and resolution [2] . Gold nanoparticles are one of the most studied contrast agents due to their high biocompatibility and optical properties. Gold nanoparticles conjugated with tumor-specific antibodies or ligands can selectively accumulate in cancer cells, providing enhanced contrast during imaging and allowing surgeons to visualize tumors more accurately. Furthermore, magnetic nanoparticles, such as superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles, have shown promise in improving MRI sensitivity by localizing in tumor tissues, providing real-time image guidance during surgery, and improving the accuracy of tumor excision [3] . Additionally, novel dual-modal imaging agents, which combine fluorescence with magnetic or computed tomography, are being explored. This enables surgeons to utilize two different imaging modes for greater accuracy and depth penetration, ensuring complete tumor removal while preserving healthy tissue [4] . \n\nFluorescence-guided surgery is becoming a critical tool in cancer surgeries. Traditional fluorescent dyes, while useful, suffer from limitations such as poor stability and rapid degradation within the body. Nanotechnology has helped overcome these limitations by providing nanoparticle-based probes that are more stable, brighter, and selectively target cancer cells [5] . Quantum dots, for instance, are semiconductor nanocrystals that exhibit robust fluorescence properties.",

            "text": "There are two problems in visualizing tumors in deep tissue, lack of contrast and tissue turbidity. In this paper we discuss the potential of gold nanorods to overcome these problems. They can serve as extremely bright light scattering labels for the detection of disease through several centimeters of tissue in humans in vivo. There is a common misconception, based on the high background signal associated with light absorption and scattering measurements, that absorption and scattering probes should always perform poorly compared to fluorescence probes such as quantum dots and molecular fluorophores. This is because the absorption and scattering labels are detected at the same wavelength as the excitation wavelength and are seen against a high background of light coming directly from the source. However, in the case of gold nanorods, this problem is overcome by two unusual properties of the nanoparticles. The first is their narrow absorption and scattering plasmon resonant linewidths [1,2]. It allows one to perform differential absorption and scattering measurements at two closely spaced wavelengths. This effectively eliminates the background signal, although the noise associated with the subtracted background signal will still be present in the measurement. The second is their extremely high absorption and scattering plasmon resonant cross sections. These very large narrowband cross sections more than compensate for the effect of the noise associated with the subtracted background signal. \n\nAt the same time gold nanorods have excellent biocompatibility, are not toxic [3], and are not susceptible to photobleaching. Their narrow and easily tunable plasmon spectral lines can thus be used to image multiple molecular targets simultaneously [1]. Finally, because, nanorod labels are smaller than vascular pore sizes, they can easily cross the vascular space to be delivered to various tissues and individual cells inside the human body via the vasculature and microvasculature. (Nanorod labels are 10-12 nm diameter and 25-50 nm length or approximately 3 to 5 times smaller than available quantum dots). Some of the material described in sections 2 and 3 has been previously published elsewhere. We include it here for the convenience of the readers of this journal who may not be familiar with the nanorod literature.",

Dendritic molecules, such as polyamidoamine (PAMAM), poly(propylene imine) polyamide, polyglycerol (PG) and triazine, are synthesized by assembling monomeric subunits to form uniform tree-like structures that allow for encapsulation of the drug payload in the internal star structure, while the branches can be complexed with functionalities, such as targeting ligands, imaging agents and other drugs (Figure 3d) [13]. Inorganic NPs exhibit photochemical, photothermal and magnetic properties that lend themselves to detection and diagnostic applications (Figure 4). Additionally, their rigid outer surface and the durable core can be complexed with a variety of drug/active agent payloads. Magnetic NPs, such as superparamagnetic iron oxide particles, have been used in image contrast and magnetic resonance to detect the presence of tumors. Modifications to the surface of these molecules, such as coating with surfactants and bioconjugation between the carboxyl and amine groups, make them amenable to complexation with targeting functionalities that can enhance the diagnostic capability of these NPs [14]. Gold NPs have optical and electric properties that can be exploited in tumor imaging [15]. Quantum dots are semiconductor NPs that have narrow emission and a broad range of absorption bands that have been predominantly used in fabricating imaging probes [16]. Gold NPs and quantum dots have been fabricated along with the organic polymers to form hybrid systems that can integrate packaging of the drug/active agent and diagnostic capabilities for effective drug delivery accompanied by real-time monitoring of treatment response and tumor activity [17,18]. Lanthanide-doped NPs are a class of fluorescent NPs that allow for conversion of low energy light, such as near infra-red (NIR), to high energy visible light or UV emission.",

Although several optoacoustic agents (such as gold nanoparticles [36,37], MoS 2 nanosheets [38,39], and semiconducting polymeric nanoparticles [40]) have been reported for optoacoustic imaging of deep brain tumors, their biodegradability remains a major concern. Therefore, biocompatible nanoparticles with suitable size and high optoacoustic generation efficiency for deep brain tumor imaging are highly desirable. \n\nTo this end, we conjugated the croconaine backbone-derived CR780 dye with a NH 2 -PEG 2000 -MAL and the cancer-targeting c(RGDyC) peptide to generate self-assembled nanoparticles with the ability to actively target a brain tumor and enable longitudinal optoacoustic imaging. We sought to test the tumor-targeting efficacy of these nanoparticles under the most challenging delivery conditions, and ultimately applied them to the imaging of an orthotopic brain tumor model using MSOT (Scheme 1). First, we compared CR780RGD-NPs to the free CR780 dye and the gold industry standard FDA-approved dye ICG in order to show that the physicochemical properties of the nanoparticles (molar absorptivity, OGE, and photostability) are optimal for effective application in optoacoustic imaging. Next, we tested the ability of MSOT to detect localized croconaine nanoparticles in vitro using tissue-mimicking phantoms at depths and beyond that of a mouse brain tumor. We also tested the in vitro BBB penetration capability and cell uptake of these nanoparticles. We further imaged a standard subcutaneous tumor model using CR780RGD-NPs and control non-targeted groups (CR780RAD-NPs) to evaluate whether the c(RGDyC) peptide-functionalized nanoparticles exhibit active targeting.",

            "text": "In SPN DN H + US group, two tumors in five individual mice were completely eradicated and the remaining three tumors showed the smallest size. The average tumor weight in SPN DN H + US group was as low as 0.02 g, lower than that in SPN D + US (0.14 g), SPN DN + US (0.08 g), and PBS (0.35 g) groups (Figure 6f). The tumor inhibition efficacy was 94.3%, 59.0%, and 78.6% for SPN DN H + US, SPN D + US, and SPN DN + US groups, respectively (Figure S13, Supporting Information). The survival of mice in SPN DN H + US group remained 100% after 25 days of treatment, which however was less than 50% in the other groups (Figure 6g). Thus, these nanoparticles could be utilized for treatments of deep-tissue orthotopic pancreatic cancer due to the strong tissue penetration capability of US. The highest antitumor therapeutic efficacy was observed in SPN DN H + US group. \n\nIn vivo anti-metastasis efficacy was investigated using BL imaging. Nearly no BL signals were detected in intestines,    6h). The BL intensity of liver, stomach, and intestines for SPN DN H + US group was at least 2.5-, 3.3-, and 4.9-fold lower than that of these organs for the other groups, respectively (Figure 6i). Moreover, the BL signals and intensities of these tissues in SPN DN H + US group were similar to those for healthy mice, which verified that tumor metastases were entirely suppressed. \n\nAlthough activatable cancer sono-immunotherapy was reported in a previous study, this therapeutic system only contained a semiconducting polymer and anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyteassociated protein 4 (CTLA-4) antibody. [21] Via combining SDT with immunotherapy, tumor growth inhibitions and metastasis suppression were achieved in subcutaneous 4T1 mouse breast tumors.",

PEG-SPIONs show prolonged half-life time of SPIONs and reduce their cellular uptake. PVA-SPIONs show meager nonselective cellular uptake and do not stop blood flow in narrow vessels. PVP-SPIONs have also improved half-life time and do not affect cells' vitality. Chitosan-and dextran-coated SPIONs are also well described, contrary to other types of coating, such as albumins, citrates, proteins and inorganic compounds were proposed, but their advantages are still not well observed [57,58].

            "text": "Nanoparticles have been actively examined as carriers for drug delivery system (DDS), which make it possible to improve therapeutic efficacy and to suppress side effects of the parent drug [1][2][3][4][5]. Among various types of nanoordered carriers including inorganic and lipid particles, polymeric micelles and vesicles, which are prepared from selfassembling process of amphiphilic polymers, can encapsulate in general hydrophobic and hydrophilic compounds in the hydrophobic core and inner aqueous cavity regions, respectively [6][7][8][9][10]. Further, not only surface modification but also functionalization of these nanoparticles is possible with ease by using suitably designed amphiphilic polymers. Therefore, polymeric nanoparticles have received much attention as the DDS carriers. \n\nAdditionally, nanoparticles are originally accumulated at the region where cells are rapidly proliferating, because leakage of nanoparticles can occur through the holes on immature blood vessels. Combined with the effect of undeveloped lymph system at tumor region, nanoparticles are retained there, leading to the passive accumulation. This phenomenon is called the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect and is one of the most frequently utilized methodologies of nanoparticles for DDS [11][12][13]. On the basis of these reasons, polymeric nanoparticle is a suitable carrier for solid tumors-targeting DDS [8,14]. In fact, various tumortargeting DDS carriers have been developed, and some polymeric nanoparticles encapsulating antitumor drugs are currently under clinical trials [15]. \n\nRecently, polymeric nanoparticles are also applied as carriers for contrast agents in the field of in vivo imaging [16][17][18]. Among various modalities such as near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) systems, the in vivo near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging system has shown amazing progresses.",

            "text": "Hydrophobically-modified chitosan polymers form nano-sized particles that can deliver hydrophobic drugs and inorganic compounds. Further, chitosan has primary amino groups that can interact with negatively charged molecules, such as peptides and genes. 14,25 ingle-modality imaging has limitations in detecting small tumors in the body. Moreover, while delineating the tumor is important to prevent recurrence and perform minimally invasive surgery, human eyes are inadequate to find the edge of tumors. Therefore, dual-modality imaging can be a promising solution to provide more visual information by simultaneously improving image resolution, sensitivity, and tissue penetration depth. Development of nanoparticles to enhance dual-modality imaging can provide even more detail on tumor locations. 26 Recently, we reported on dual-modality CNPs with nanospheres, expanding their function as MRI agents as well as optical imaging agents (with near infrared fluorescence [NIRF] probes, such as cyanine 5.5 [Cy5.5]) and positron emission tomography imaging agents. 8][29] However, optimizing the design of dual-modality nanoparticles to satisfy both the imaging function and a good biodistribution remains a challenge. While dual-modality nanoparticles can expand the imaging capabilities, they can also increase nonspecific accumulation to organs and tissues due to the altered physicochemical characteristics of the nanoparticles. Also, visualizing small tumors (,5 mm in diameter) in both imaging modalities is even more challenging, requiring more specific accumulation at tumor sites. Moreover, dual-modality nanoparticles, including metals such as iron oxide or gold, can easily accumulate in the liver or spleen. \n\nThus, maintaining a successful in vivo biodistribution is critical as the imaging functions of the nanoparticles expand. \n\nIn this study, we varied the physicochemical properties and functions of glycol CNP by conjugating them to a CSNRDARRC and loading ferrimagnetic iron oxide NCs into them. 11,30 The biodistribution and tumor accumulation of the modified nanoparticles in each step were compared in parallel through in vivo systems.",

            "text": "Clinical trials are ongoing using different approaches to nanotechnology-based cancer diagnosis [7]. Such an example is a study by Phillips et al. [28] where they used tumor-specific ultrasmall inorganic hybrid nanoparticles (124I-cRGDY-PEG-dots) for the positron emission tomography (PET) scan imaging of metastatic melanoma and malignant brain tumors. Findings showed that the hybrid nanoparticles are safe and well-tolerated in humans [28]. Another ongoing clinical trial is a study by Zanoni et al. [29], where ultrasmall core-shell fluorescent silica (cRGDY-PEG-Cy5.5) nanoparticles were used for real-time image-guided biopsy of sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) in head and neck melanoma. Phase 2 results found this safe for humans. This approach enabled high-sensitivity visualization of SLN, lymph node mapping, deep tissue imaging, including anatomic sites that are difficult to access, and even detecting cancer through intact skin. \n\nThere was a high concordance rate (90%) compared to the standard-of-care technetium Tc 99 m sulfur colloid. With the intraoperative identification of SLN involvement, extensive and unnecessary dissection of adjacent normal tissues and nerves was prevented [29]. \n\nIn PRS, biocompatible and mechanically robust nanocomposite polymers have been undergoing active research due to rupture and leakage of currently used implants, such as breast implants [5]. Nanocomposite polymers are just like the typical composite materials comprising two main elements, a matrix, and a filler material for reinforcement, but one or both are of nanoscale size [5]. Tan et al. [30] have developed POSS-PCU (polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane poly(carbonate-urea) urethane), a novel nanocomposite material with superior mechanical engineering properties, improved biocompatibility, and enhanced resistance to degradation with various medical applications. POSS-PCU is also valuable for plastic surgery, particularly breast implants.",

Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) in particular are very attractive candidate nanoparticles to facilitate these \ue104uorescence enhancements because of their high chemical stabilities, high homogeneities, good biocompatibilities 25 and low toxicities. 1 Furthermore, the surface chemistry of AuNPs is well-understood and numerous chemistries are available to facilitate the surface modi\ue103cation of AuNPs. The incident radiation must also be resonant with the absorption transition of the \ue104uorophore. SiQDs are convenient in this case because they possess a featureless absorption spectrum with an absorbance that rises monotonically above the gap ($2 eV in our SiQDs) and therefore it is only necessary to match the excitation wavelength to the plasmon mode of the metal. \n\n7][28] AuNPs have also been successfully fabricated with other \ue104uorophores to prepare nanocomposites with optically active properties, especially in metal-enhanced \ue104uorescence, surface-enhanced Raman scattering, surface plasmon-coupled emission and plasmon-controlled \ue104uorescence systems. 29 Furthermore, there have been several recent impressive reports describing the fabrication of AuNPs with \ue104uorescent dyes 30 or CdSe-type quantum dots 31,32 in various particular research areas. \n\n2][43][44][45][46][47][48] Encapsulation of inorganic species inside polymer matrices affords composite materials which bene\ue103t from the outstanding properties associated with synthetic polymers e.g. their excellent mechanical, chemical, electrical, rheological, magnetic and optical properties. 33",

            "text": "To achieve this, a NIR-emitting dye or nanoparticle was commonly selected to covalently conjugate with the natural bioluminescence system as an acceptor to allow for efficient energy transfer (Weihs and Dacres, 2019). Rao et al. developed a series of BRET-based NIR bioluminescence inorganic systems, in which a Renilla reniformis luciferase (Luc8) served as an energy donor and quantum dots (QDs) acted as an energy acceptor (So et al., 2006a,b;Yao et al., 2007;Ma et al., 2010). Such QDs-based BRET systems engineering with emissions ranging from visible to the NIR were utilized for in vivo imaging and enzyme activity detection with high sensitivity. Except for inorganic BRET systems, Rao et al. also tried to introduce organic systems for constructing BRET-based NIR bioluminescence. For instance, self-luminescent semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (BF-SPN) were developed for in vivo NIR bioluminescence imaging by combining BRET and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) (Xiong et al., 2012). The nanoparticles (BF-SPNs) were designed to comprise three components: Luc8, poly [2-methoxy-5-((2ethylhexyl)oxy)-p-phenylenevinylene] (MEHPPV) and silicon 2,3-naphthalocyanine bis(trihexylsilyloxide) (NCBS) serving as the BRET donor, the BRET acceptor (and the FRET donor) and the FRET acceptor, respectively. Such BRET-FRET system produced multiple energy transfer from Luc8 to MEHPPV and then to NCBS, resulting in final NIR bioluminescence centered at 780 nm. In order to improve the targeted ability toward tumor, the cyclic arginine-glycine-aspartic (cRGD) peptides were attached to the surface of SPN to obtain BF-SPN-cRGD (Figure 2A).",

SPN-IIs with four different concentrations for in vitro deep tissue PA imaging at both 750 nm and 1064 nm were investigated. As shown in Fig. 10c, acquired PA imaging displayed detectable PA signal at two wavelengths under the highest concentration (1 mg/mL), and SNR in the NIR-II region is obviously higher than that in the NIR-I region for all the depths (Fig. 10b). Because laser with longer wavelength allows higher maximum permissible exposure, 1064 nm laser energy density was increased to 20 mJ/cm 2 . And imaging depth of 4 and 5 cm was realized for the lowest (0.05 mg/mL) and highest concentration (1 mg/mL), respectively. Furthermore, PA imaging of brain cortex of living rats in both NIR-I and NIR-II window was conducted. Compared to the 750 nm laser, more clear vascular distribution and higher SBR were obtained under 1064 nm (Fig. 10d, e). These results all highlighted the advantages of PA imaging application in the NIR-II region compared to that in the NIR-I region [50]. \n\nRecently, Guo and co-workers reported another D-A1-D-A2 structural NIR-II PA contrast agent (PTD NPs) for PA microscopic imaging of ear vasculatures of healthy or angiogenic tumor-bearing mice. PA imaging of ear vasculatures of healthy nude mouse under 1064 nm laser was first studied. Before intravenous injection, obviously no PA signal was observed (Fig. 11a), but the intricate blood vessels even capillarylevel microvessels were clearly delineated 5 min after injection of PTD NPs (Fig. 11b). Furthermore, vivid 3D volumetric images were constructed by collecting PA signals in a layer-by-layer fashion (Fig. 11c). Subsequently, mapping of tumor and supervision of tumor angiogenesis were achieved using PTD NPs.",

            "text": "With the great advance in synthetic strategies, researchers are capable of preparing a variety of gold nanoparticles including nanospheres, nanorods, nanoshells and nanocages [42][43][44][45][46][47]. With proper post-functionalization, gold nanoparticles have been demonstrated to be promising agents for cancer therapy. Gold nanoparticles have been widely investigated as photothermal agents and drug carriers, attributed to their optical properties, biocompatibility, inertness and ease of preparation. The SPR properties of gold nanoparticle make them promising photothermal therapy agents for cancer treatment. Upon the absorption of light, gold nanoparticles can generate heat because of the electron-phonon and phonon-phonon interactions. For instance, localized cell damage was demonstrated with antibody conjugated nanoparticles that are irradiated with shorter laser pulses [48]. In addition, the SPR of gold nanorods, gold nanoshells and gold nanocages can be easily tuned into the near infrared region, which permits deeper tissue penetration and less photodamage. \n\nPhotothermal therapy with gold nanorods was first reported by Huang et al. High efficacy toward cancer cells was demonstrated in vitro by irradiating the gold nanorods with a continuous near-infrared laser at 800 nm [49]. The possibility of tumor suppression with gold nanorod-based photothermal therapy was demonstrated in vivo using a mice model [50]. The gold nanorods were injected into the tail veins of tumor-bearing mice and exposed to an NIR laser. After 10 days of treatment, the tumors for the ones treated with nanorods completely disappeared when externally observed, while the tumors for the control grow progressively. After 20 days of treatment, there was no tumor regrowth for the ones treated with nanorods, while there was rapid tumor growth for the controls as shown in Figure 1. It was demonstrated that gold nanorods could be used as an effective photothermal agent for tumor suppression in vivo. More recently, Kolemen et al. have investigated endoperoxide-modified gold nanorods as potential photodynamic therapy. Controlled release of singlet oxygen was achieved by plasmonic heating.",

            "text": "Methylene blue has been used for imaging of sentinel lymph nodes (SLN), which are the first nodes in the lymphatic system that drains a tumor site.Typically, a negative SLN biopsy result suggests that cancer has not spread to nearby lymph nodes or other organs, and PA can determine if the lymph node is an SLN by imaging accumulated blue dye.\n\nAn alternative to these traditional contrast enhancing dyes are nanoparticles.Nanoparticles can be made from a variety of materials and manufactured into various shapes, which makes them highly tunable depending on their purpose [41].A common choice is gold nanospheres due to the simplicity in manufacturing, and they have a peak absorption around 520 nm, which is useful as it lies within a local minimum in the optical window of both blood and skin [41,48,49].Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) also fall into this category of exogenous contrast agents [50].Which have a wide absorption spectrum, outside the visible spectrum up to 3 GHz.Typically, SWNTs are used in conjunction with other contrast enhancing agents, such as gold nanorods, various dyes, or targeting agents like arginylglycylaspartic acid (RGD) peptides, which enhance the resulting PA signal than if they were used alone.The next advancement in using nanoparticles for contrast enhancement looks at being able to have more direct control of the release of these contrast agents through the use of thermo-responsive nanoparticles [51].These thermo-responsive contrast agents allow for remote influence of PA signals via photoirradiation to enhance the signal-to-background noise of various targets, such as tumors.This allows for enhanced signal generation within a region-of-interest while ignoring the background.\n\nOne advantage of PA imaging is its ability to use endogenous contrast agents to derive quantitative information on disease/pathology progression.However, when the background noise levels are too high, or when it is difficult to distinguish the region-ofinterest from the surrounding tissue, alternative methods have been developed to enhance contrast.These contrast-enhancing exogenous agents can target specific pathologies more efficiently and increase the sensitivity and specificity of photoacoustic imaging.",

Common biological imaging techniques encompass NIR \ue104uorescence imaging, photoacoustic (PA) imaging, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). \n\n4.5.1 NIR \ue104uorescence imaging. NIR \ue104uorescence imaging primarily consists of a \ue104uorescent probe and an imaging system. Traditional \ue104uorescence imaging relies on \ue104uorophores excited within the \ue103rst near-infrared window (NIR-I, 650-950 nm). However, NIR-I \ue104uorescence imaging is inherently limited by signi\ue103cant light scattering and auto\ue104uorescence in biological tissues, resulting in restricted tissue penetration depth (<1 cm), reduced spatial resolution, and inadequate signal background ratio (SBR). 154 Currently, NIR \ue104uorescence imaging has been extended to include \ue104uorescence imaging in the second NIR window (NIR-II, 1000-1700 nm). It relies on fewer lighttissue interactions, which can signi\ue103cantly reduce light scattering and decrease tissue auto\ue104uorescence. As a result, NIR-II imaging exhibits high SBR and allows for deeper penetration into biological tissues, enabling more efficient in vivo imaging. 155 A diverse array of NIR-II \ue104uorophores has been developed for \ue104uorescence imaging, encompassing quantum dots (QDs), 156 gold nanoshells, 157 rare-earth doped NPs, 158 and semiconductor polymers. 159 n one study, in order to achieve real-time tumor monitoring and accurate tumor surgical guidance, Ag 2 Te quantum dots were self-assembled with PLGA NPs and then wrapped with 4T1 cell membrane to obtain membrane camou\ue104age nanoparticles (CPQDs) (Fig. 9A). 42 The platform demonstrates exceptional \ue104uorescence brightness and remarkable stability within the NIR II window. The \ue104uorescence intensity of the colloidal quantum dots (CPQDs) remains at 97% even under continuous exposure to an 808 nm laser, while the ICG only maintains a \ue104uorescence intensity of 24% (Fig. 9B).",

            "text": "Nanoparticles are a promising means in diagnostics, treatment and medical imaging. They act as a tar-get delivery tool and help in the delivery through two different methods, passive and active targeting. Active targeting employs antibodies, receptors, and peptides to identify tumor antigens as a means to offer target delivery. Passive targeting employs the improved penetrability and retention (EPR) effect seen in tumor vasculature as a means to assist cancer treatment. With the utilization of nanoparticles in the treatment of cancer, selectivity is enhanced and accidental systemic injury is strongly prevented. Nanoparticles not only take bene it of the improved permeability of tumors but also take advantage of the decreased lymphatic clearance of tumorous tissue compared to healthy tissue. This absence of clearance permits for the withholding of the nanoparticle and the drug it carries to stay in the tumors for an extended period of time, permitting for progressive therapeutic ef icacy. \n\nIn addition, as an imaging tool, nanoparticles provide an enhancement in the sensitivity and speciicity of diagnostic imaging, presenting a noninvasive and precise technique. Nanotechnologybased imaging probes are intended to identify a biomarker located on the cell surface of interest. The nanoparticles are supportive in re ining the difference between cancerous and non-cancerous tissue. (SeeFigure 5) (Fang et al., 2011). The method adopted is a unique type of luorescent nanoparticles identi ied as Quantum Dots (QDs) have acquired momentum as an approach to enhance the imaging signal. QDs release photons of light of numerous wavelengths upon excitation. The bene it of those nanoparticles in diagnostic imaging over the conventionally used contrast agents is their low cost of synthesis and easy application. Additionally, current discovery is the application of nanoparticles in an MRI. It is well furnished that superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles with lymphotropic qualities have been con irmed to ef icaciously intensify the inding of tumors above 5 mm when compared to unenhanced MRI or computed tomography.",

            "text": "The results of PA imaging and HIF-1\u03b1 protein expression analysis demonstrated that this system could efficiently deliver O 2 and alleviate tumor hypoxia [29]. \n\nSince hemoglobin carries O 2 inside the red blood cells (RBCs), RBCs have also been widely used as drug carriers. Nanoscale RBCs or red blood cell membrane (RBCM)modified nanoparticles (NPs) are an effective way to ensure tumor permeability or internalization [43]. For example, Ding et al. constructed a red blood cell biomimetic nanovesicle (SPN-Hb@RBCM), as shown in Figure 2. In this system, the oxygen-supplying hemoglobin was linked with semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPN), which was a theranostic agent for near-infrared (NIR)-II fluorescence imaging and singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ) production for PDT. The resulting SPN-Hb was further coated with RBCM to form SPN-Hb@RBCM. Notably, this RBCM coated system promoted longer circulation time and nanoparticle accumulation in vivo, allowing for enhanced treatment efficacies. The in vitro experiment result showed that the overall oxygen-carrying capacity of SPN-Hb@RBCM nanoparticles was determined and calculated to be 0.142 \u00b5g of O 2 per 1 mg NPs. The cell-killing efficacy was 90.3% in the SPN-oxy-Hb@RBCM group and was only 45.1% in the SPN@RBCM groups, showing that the SPN-oxy-Hb@RBCM with oxygen self-supply ability could retain its great PDT efficiency under hypoxia environments. Although this strategy could improve hypoxia to a certain extent, the oxygen loading content of the nanomaterial was limited, which may restrict the practical application [30]. \n\nPEGylated, followed by the cooperation of Gd nanoparticles, photosensitizer Ce6, and oxygen.",

            "text": "However, the application potential of this new strategy has been limited due to the cost and synthesis process constraints, and thus the development of more convenient, more economical sensors for potential clinical applications has become a new trend at present. \n\nIn the diagnosis and cancer treatment, the recognition of cancer tissues or lesion images is very important. For example, X-ray high-absorption gold nanoparticles (GNPs) can be used as a computed tomography (CT) imaging enhancer for in vivo angiography, since GNPs (polymers and mRNA) or their targeted modification (e.g., with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), RGD peptide, folic acid) can accumulate in tumor tissues and enhance image development [40,71,72]. Nanotechnology also uses near-infrared or luminescence quantum dots to detect oral cancer or other oral diseases [40,73,74]. Ankri et al. [75] combined gold nanorods with EGFR and found that gold nanorods spread gradients from tumor tissue to normal epithelium, which can be used as an objective measurement tool to determine tumor margins. The targeting of gold nanorods to oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) was measured by the diffusion reflection method. A recent study showed that light absorption intensity significantly increased in rats with oral cancer when compared with rats without cancer [76], demonstrating that AuNPs-based high imaging contrast and resolution have great potential in determining tumor margins and distinguishing benign and malignant lesions. Thus, emerging nanotechnology has developed rapidly in the areas of oral biomarker enrichment, multiple marker analyses and real-time diagnosis and has broad application potential in oral disease diagnosis and management.",

Inorganic nanoprobes are quantum dots (a) or dye-loaded silica, calcium phosphate, gold or oxide nanoparticles, for which the organic dye can be included in the inorganic matrix (b), or grafted on the nanoparticle surface (c). Organic nanoprobes can be divided in two main families: dye-loaded polymer-based and dye-loaded lipid-based nanoparticles. In each family, different architectures can be found: polymer-or lipid-core particles (polymer nanospheres (d), proteins (e), lipid nanoparticles (f), lipoproteins (g)), self-assembled constructions (polymer (h) or lipid (i) micelles), nanocapsules (polymersomes (j) or liposomes (k)).

Inorganic nanoparticles have different physical and chemical properties such as inertness, stability, and ease of functionalization. Metal, semiconductor, and graphene-based nanoparticles have excellent optical and electrochemical properties such as fluorescence, surface plasmon resonance, and Raman enhancement that enable their use as sensors and transducing devices. The paramagnetic and superparamagnetic inorganic nanoparticles, for example, FeO nanoparticles, have found molecular imaging applications such as computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or positron emission tomography as an image contrast agent [41]. Inorganic nanoparticles have characteristic near-infrared (NIR) absorption or emission for luminescence imaging. Since the NIR light can penetrate deeper into and out of biological tissues when compared with the UV, visible, or far IR light, nanomaterials, which can absorb in NIR region, are more efficient in converting optical energy into thermal energy and have found clinical applications in photothermal therapy (PTT) [42][43][44].",

            "text": "This allows for detection of even the smallest metastatic foci in lymph nodes, often not detectable in MRI scans acquired with traditional contrast agents [7]. \n\nOf wide interest as potential mMRI contrasts with dominant T2 effect are nanoparticles containing metals (e.g. Au, Re, Ag, Ni, Co) or iron oxides (Fe 3 O 4 ). Research includes multifunctional contrast probes of class Au 3 Cu 1 [8] or modified iron oxide nanoparticles of the group of superparamagnetic (SPIO) and ultrasuperparamagnetic (USPIO) iron oxides. Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles in dextran or carboxydextran shell, characterized by their affinity towards the reticulo-endothelial systems, are taken up by Kupffer cell-containing liver parenchymal cells, while not being accumulated in tumors devoid of Kupffer cells, such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), thus enhancing the efficacy of MRI scans in detecting neoplastic lesions [9,10]. Nanoencapsulated USPIOs may be used for early diagnostics of prostate and rectal cancer, as well as for imaging of small aggregates of neoplastic cells in other organs [11,12]. \n\nBesides the preclinically tested metallic nanoparticle-based platforms, the search for future biosensors and contrast agents is also focused on quantum dots, carbon nanotubes, Au nanorods, etc. In light of the results obtained to date, one may suppose that quantum dots linked to hyaluronic acid might be useful for the monitoring of progression of neoplastic lesions, the progress of solid tumor treatment and visualization of lymphatic vessels [13,14]. In order to increase the number of probes penetrating into the tumor region and the enhancement of signal intensity, development of nanoplatforms characterized by smaller dimension is currently attempted. Nanoparticles used in traditional in vivo scans are ca. 15-30 nm in diameter. Literature sources contain reports of attempted development of nanoprobes with particle sizes smaller than 2 mm, such as InAs-ZnSe [15].",

Inorganic nanoparticles have different physical and chemical properties such as inertness, stability, and ease of functionalization. Metal, semiconductor, and graphene-based nanoparticles have excellent optical and electrochemical properties such as fluorescence, surface plasmon resonance, and Raman enhancement that enable their use as sensors and transducing devices. The paramagnetic and superparamagnetic inorganic nanoparticles, for example, FeO nanoparticles, have found molecular imaging applications such as computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or positron emission tomography as an image contrast agent [41]. Inorganic nanoparticles have characteristic near-infrared (NIR) absorption or emission for luminescence imaging. Since the NIR light can penetrate deeper into and out of biological tissues when compared with the UV, visible, or far IR light, nanomaterials, which can absorb in NIR region, are more efficient in converting optical energy into thermal energy and have found clinical applications in photothermal therapy (PTT) [42][43][44].",

In particular the surface derivatization of the polymer is typically much more facile than of the inorganic nanoparticles. \n\nWe recently showed that silicon quantum dots (SiQDs) can be encapsulated inside polymeric nanoparticles, resulting in a nanocomposite which possesses the luminescence of the SiQDs and the processability of the polymer matrix. 9 SiQDs are of interest on account of their size-dependent luminescence characteristics; they exhibit intense room-temperature luminescence from the radiative recombination of quantum-con\ue103ned excitons. 10 The intensity of luminescence is enhanced in SiQDs by the quasi-direct nature of the transitions involved. 11 he emission frequencies can be tuned through part of the visible and near-infrared spectrum by varying QDs size 12 or surface termination. 13 The most signi\ue103cant advantage of SiQDs over other QDs for applications in the life sciences is the absence of heavy metal ion leaching, which results in reduced toxicity. 14 However, it is well noted that the overall brightness of SiQDs can be restricted by a low radiative emission rate as a consequence of the indirect band gap of bulk silicon, 10,15,16 which limits the possible utility of this class of nanoparticle. \n\nWe were intrigued by the possibility of enhancing the \ue104uorescent properties of SiQDs by combining them with metallic nanoparticles within a nano-sized polymer matrix, as metallic nanoparticles of gold, silver and aluminium offer a possible method to enhance the brightness of SiQDs.",

            "text": "Dai et al. created NIR-I and NIR-II imaging systems for the first time, as shown in Fig. 3A. [70] Alloys of semiconductors for NIR-II fluorescence imaging and camera materials such as InGaAs and HgCdTe can be used. At wavelengths longer than 1700 nm, the HgCdTe detector exhibits the highest sensitivity; however, its overall quantum efficiency is quite low. Conversely, inside the NIR-II window, the InGaAs detector exhibited a high quantum efficiency of up to 90% (Fig. 3B) [71]. A novel visual detection method in vivo is fluorescence imaging technology, which is highly sensitive and has high temporal and spatial resolution. Traditional near-infrared fluorescence imaging is mainly focused on superficial lesions; therefore, surgery is often needed to expose the tumor area. When light penetrates a biological tissue, it attenuates due to the absorption and scattering of the tissue [72]. In the near-infrared region (700 ~ 1700 nm), the attenuation coefficient of biological tissue remains relatively low but is almost 100 times greater than that in the ultraviolet and visible regions (Fig. 3C) [73]. \n\nNIR-II imaging results in a greater SNR, deeper tissue penetration, and lower spontaneous background fluorescence than NIR-I imaging. NIR-II fluorescence imaging can therefore aid in the precise identification of deep-seated illnesses. NIR-II fluorescence imaging is based on the NIR-II fluorescent probe. Many organic and inorganic materials have been used to create a variety of NIR-II fluorescence probes. These materials include conjugated polymers, organic nanoparticles derived from small-molecule dyes, organic small-molecule dyes, quantum dots, rare-earth doped nanoparticles, and singlewalled carbon nanotubes (Table 2) [63,[74][75][76][77]. \n\nAmong the reported candidate nanomaterials for NIR-II fluorescence imaging, sulfur-containing silver quantum dots (QDs) and SWCNTs are the most promising [78][79][80][81].",

Henceforth, this PAI methodologies would improve imaging signals at the deep-penetrated tissue regions via the production of the high spatial mode of resolution [43]. Via combination of various chemical and functional nanomaterials fluorophores could be used in endogenously for the high contrast image signals thereby; we can achieve the structural imaging of the brain functions through the oxygen saturations. In recent decades, the PAI applications in the clinical level are rapidly growing, necessitating the essential strategies of innovations [121]. Thus, upon employing the functional nanomaterials developmental strategies, the nanoma-terials with improved imaging signals towards the generation of optical absorbance can target the diseased sites of the brain elements that could have been easily sensitized for the PAI conditions [122,123]. These functional nanomaterials, such as organic, quantum dots, functional polymer coupled agents, inorganic contrast imaging agents or nanostructures, copper and carbon nanomaterials, and small molecule coupled fluorophores with a variety of applicatory potentials, have led the potential translations of PAI in associated neurological diseases, including glioblastoma and other cancers. Yang et.al. [124] proposed a functional semiconducting polymer-based nanomaterials platform for contrast imaging applications in multimodal imaging of orthotopic brain tumors (glioblastoma) via applying the PAI with pulsed lased as a NIR light source (Figure 6). The study demonstrated the engineered nanomaterials of the report had the greater potentials of NIR and PA for deep tissue penetrated imaging by utilizing the nanoparticles as high contrast imaging candidates. Due to the nanomaterials' maximal absorption behavior (NIR-II 1064 nm), the higher image contrast signals were produced from the deep-tissue regions of the glioma in vivo without causing any severe damage to the normal tissues.",

            "text": "SPNC is composed of a semiconducting polymer nanoparticle core as a sonodynamic converter, conjugated with an oxygen-modulating enzyme, catalase, via a coupling reaction between the amino group of catalase and the carboxyl group of SPN (Figure 1a). Current studies have demonstrated that nanoparticles with sizes below 60 nm show substantially enhanced penetrating behavior in tumor tissues. [18] To verify the vital role of particle size in controlling the penetration of sonosensitizers in large solid tumors, three SPNCs of different sizes are fabricated. Catalase is chosen to react with hydrogen peroxide overproduced in the tumor microenvironment (TME) to generate oxygen in situ to improve tumor hypoxia for enhanced SDT. After systemic administration, all these SPNCs can accumulate in the tumor site through passive targeting. Only SPNC with the smallest size (SPNC1) can preferentially penetrate inside the solid tumor of living mice, thus increasing oxygenation in the inner solid tumor, and thereby boosting the sonotherapeutic effect of large solid tumors upon US irradiation (Figure 1b). As such, SPNC1-mediated sonodynamic therapy synergistically conquers both poor penetration and hypoxia, contributing to effective large solid tumor inhibition in the mouse model.",

The integration of QD-based nanotechnology and cancer biomarkers, in particular, could open up new avenues in clinical oncology, such as cancer diagnosis, treatment, prediction, and monitoring. 174,175 see Figure 7.\n\nColloidal semiconductor quantum dots (SQDs) have dominated much of the cancer detection research over the last few decades. These are nanometer-sized crystals of semiconductor materials including CdSe, ZnS, InP, and PbSe that have stabilizing ligands attached to their surfaces to prevent aggregation. Because the supply of these elements in nature is limited, SQDs are costly. Graphene quantum dots (GQDs)-or carbon counterparts to SQDshave emerged as promising alternatives, giving numerous interesting options for precision cancer diagnosis due to their availability, low cost, and biocompatibility. 176 In preliminary evaluation and research, the PCA3 gene shows tremendous promise in the diagnosis of PCa when compared to the PSA test. Fluorescence-based assays have gained popularity due to their rapid reaction, high sensitivity, nondestructive nature, and ability to monitor in real-time. Huang's team created an NIR fluorescence enhanced satellite structure probe for sensitive and specific detection of PCA3 using DNA1-Au nanorods (NRs) and DNA2-Ag 2 S QDs. 178 The optimal metal-enhanced fluorescence (MEF) effect distance between Au NRs and Ag 2 S QDs is 8.16 nm, which is perfectly matched with the length of the PCA3 sequence. The composite probe can boost the luminescence performance of NIR Ag 2 S QDs at an acceptable distance by using the MEF effect. PCA3 can couple DNA1-Au NRs with DNA2-Ag 2 S via the base",

For instance, quantum dots [17] , carbon nanotubes [18] , nanowires [19] and magnetic nanoparticles [20][21][22] have attracted much attention as signal transducers. Biosensors based on nanotechnology show high specificity and sensitivity after being labeled with DNA probe or antibody. The nanoparticle-based biosensor has high specificity, ease of operation, low cost, and the sensitivity needed for the rapid and reproducible detection of pathogenic microorganisms in clinical specimens. However, the covalent labeling with nanoparticles is time consuming and involves complicated synthetic proce-dures. \n\nGold nanorod material has high light absorption and a large scattering cross-section in the SPR wavelength regions. Therefore, Wang et al [23] designed a novel gold nanorod biosensor based on localized SPR (LSPR) to detect hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Investigation of the HBs-antibody-modified gold nanorod indicates that physical adsorption and successive blocking lead to a flexible shell enveloping the nanorod, which minimizes the nonspecific adsorption and allows the assays to work in buffer, serum and plasma. The experimental results indicate that a gold-nanorod-based LSPR biosensor is capable of measuring HBsAg concentration even at 0.01 IU/mL, which is about 40 times lower than the limit of detection of the ELISA method. The gold-nanorodbased biosensor can be utilized in quantitative analysis with a dose-dependent response ranging from 0.01 to 1 IU/mL.",

            "text": "Quantum dots, for instance, are semiconductor nanocrystals that exhibit robust fluorescence properties. They can be engineered to specifically target cancer cells by attaching peptides, antibodies, or small molecules that recognize tumor markers. Their brightness and photostability allow surgeons to accurately distinguish cancerous tissues from surrounding healthy tissues during surgery. The use of quantum dots in fuorescence-guided surgery enables more precise excisions, reducing the likelihood of leaving residual cancer cells behind and thus decreasing the chances of tumor recurrence [6] . Moreover, newer developments in fluorescence-guided surgery involve combining nanoparticles with near-infrared dyes. Nearinfrared fluorescence can penetrate deeper tissues compared to visible light, allowing for more effective visualization of tumors located beneath the skin or deep within the body. These technologies are especially useful in surgeries for breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and other solid tumors [7] . \n\nIntraoperative chemotherapy-administering anticancer drugs during surgery-is a promising strategy to eliminate residual cancer cells. However, traditional chemotherapy drugs are nonspecific and can cause systemic toxicity. Nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems address these challenges by enabling targeted delivery of chemotherapeutic agents to the tumor site, thereby minimizing damage to surrounding healthy tissues [8] . Nanocarriers such as liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, micelles, and dendrimers have been developed for targeted drug delivery. These nanoparticles can be loaded with anticancer drugs and functionalized with targeting ligands or antibodies that recognize tumor-specific receptors. Once administered, these nanoparticle carriers ensure the drug is delivered directly to cancer cells, enhancing therapeutic efficacy and reducing side effects [9] . For example, liposomal formulations of doxorubicin (Doxil) are already in clinical use, where the drug is encapsulated in liposomes, ensuring it is preferentially delivered to the tumor site and reducing cardiac toxicity associated with traditional doxorubicin.",

Pu and colleagues have recently reported the use of NIR lightabsorbing semiconducting polymer nanoparticles as a new class of contrast agents for photoacoustic molecular imaging. 82 The nanoparticles produced a stronger signal than the commonly used gold nanorods and single-walled carbon nanotubes, providing real-time in vivo imaging of reactive oxygen species.

            "text": "Recent advancements in nanotechnology have led to the development of innovative nanoparticle systems designed to overcome the limitations of traditional therapeutic approaches in cancer treatment. One promising category is biomimetic nanoparticles, which are engineered to mimic the biological properties of cells and tissues, enhancing biocompatibility and reducing immunogenicity. For instance, cell membrane-coated nanoparticles, which are cloaked with membranes derived from red blood cells or cancer cells, can evade immune detection and circulate in the bloodstream for extended periods, thus enhancing the targeting of tumor sites (Fang et al., 2018). Biomimetic designs improve the nanoparticles' ability to penetrate biological barriers and deliver therapeutic agents with greater precision, demonstrating higher retention in tumor environments as compared to uncoated nanoparticles (Hu et al., 2015). \n\nIn parallel, hybrid organic-inorganic nanoparticle systems are emerging as a robust approach to synergize the unique advantages of both material types. Organic components, such as lipids or polymers, offer biocompatibility and modifiable surfaces, while inorganic materials, including metals or silica, provide stability and can enhance imaging capabilities. For example, silica-coated gold nanoparticles have been developed for photothermal therapy and are able to efficiently convert light energy into heat to ablate tumor cells upon irradiation. These hybrid systems allow for multifunctional capabilities, such as simultaneous imaging and therapy, which is increasingly being applied in theranostic (therapeutic and diagnostic) applications. The integration of organic and inorganic components also allows for tunable drug release profiles, facilitating controlled delivery in response to specific physiological triggers such as pH or temperature (Fang et al., 2018). \n\nEmerging technologies in nanoparticle design are focused on improving functionality through nanoscale modifications that enhance targeting, reduce toxicity, and promote biodegradability.

Similarly, other oxygen-generating photosensitizers have been used to construct NPs with US detectability [146][147][148]. For example, Gao et al. constructed indocyanine green (ICG) modified hyaluronic acid nanoparticle encapsulating manganese dioxide (MnO 2 ) NPs, which are photosensitizers that react with endogenous H 2 O 2 to generate oxygen bubbles. This study demonstrated that tumor accumulation of the NPs led to 2.25 times higher oxygen contents in tumor as confirmed by ultrasound imaging. This nanotheranostic system was also demonstrated to inhibit growth of squamous cell carcinoma in mice and improve survival through PDT [147]. Besides micro/nano-bubbles and polymeric nanoparticles, recent studies have also demonstrated the potential of inorganic NPs as US-detectable nanotheranostics. For example, Zhang et al. constructed a type of core-shell nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dot (N-GQD) coated with the water-splitting agent carbon nitride (C3N4) [145]. The NPs were also decorated with integrin \u03b1v\u03b23-targeted RGD peptides to facilitate active targeting to tumor. Upon irradiation with laser, the C3N4 layer splits endogenous H2O molecules and induces generation a substantial amount of O2 bubbles, and hence contribute to enhanced echogenic reflectivity in tumor.

To reveal the functionality of each layer, four kinds of control SPNs with different nanoarchitectures were synthesized for each SP (Fig. 1a): bare SPNs (SPNs-B), SPNs made from co-precipitation with the amphiphilic triblock copolymer (PEG-b-PPG-b-PEG, F127) (SPNs-F), SPNs with a silica shell (SPNs-Si) and SPNs-M. To prepare SPNs-M, a THF solution of SPs and the amphiphilic triblock copolymer (PEG-b-PPG-b-PEG, F127) with a weight ratio of 1 : 200 was \ue103rst prepared and THF was then evaporated. The amphiphilic triblock copolymer was used to stabilize the hydrophobic SP core in water as well as to serve as a template to direct the formation of the middle silica layer. A\ue09der the dried \ue103lm of SPs and F127 was redissolved in a hydrochloride solution with the assistance of sonication, tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) was then added to the solution to allow the silicate condensation to happen, leading to the formation of the middle silica layer. Finally, silane-PEG2000 was added to the reaction solution to serve as a surface end-capping reagent to terminate the silicate condensation as well as to form the third PEG outer corona. This one-pot synthetic approach is straightforward and different from the reported preparation methods that were used to coat silica nanoparticles with PEG, which generally involved multiple post-reaction steps such as a 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) coupling reaction that may cause issues such as a broadened particle distribution and low PEG gra\ue09ding density. 45,46 Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to examine the morphology of SPNs",

Compared to nano-hexapods, nanocages have a greater photothermal conversion efficiency per gold atom. However, a few contradictory investigations have shown that when exposed to an X-ray source, spherical nanoparticles kill more cells than nanorods and nanospikes do [93]. The localized SPR (LSPR), which is brought on by the activation of a collective and coherent oscillation of conduction electrons near the surface of AuNPs by an external laser of a particular wavelength. This oscillation produces scattering peaks, spectrum absorption, and local field enhancements because it is in resonance with the incident light frequency. AuNPs' scattering and absorption characteristics can be improved by adjusting their SPR. Water and hemoglobin, have lowest absorption coefficients and scatters the excitation emission photons in NIR. This allows for maximum laser penetration in the tissue and reduces autofluorescence of the non-laser components. AuNPs are ideal options for photothermal therapy and photoacoustic imaging agents due to their LSPR and NIR spectral range.

            "text": "The advancement of nanoscience and material design in recent times has facilitated the creation of point-of-care devices for cancer diagnosis and biomolecule sensing. Exosomes (EXOs) facilitate the transfer of bioactive molecules between cancer cells and diverse cells in the local and distant microenvironments, thereby contributing to cancer progression and metastasis. Specifically, EXOs derived from cancer are likely to function as biomarkers for early cancer detection due to the genetic or signaling alterations they transport as payload within the cancer cells of origin. It has been verified that EXOs circulate steadily in bodily secretions and contain a variety of information that indicates the progression of the tumor. However, acquiring molecular information and interactions regarding EXOs has presented significant technical challenges due to their nanoscale nature and high heterogeneity. Colorimetry, surface plasmon resonance (SPR), fluorescence, and Raman scattering are examples of optical techniques utilized to quantify cancer exosomal biomarkers, including lipids, proteins, RNA, and DNA. Many optically active nanoparticles (NPs), predominantly carbon-based, inorganic, organic, and composite-based nanomaterials, have been employed in biosensing technology. The exceptional physical properties exhibited by nanomaterials, including carbon NPs, noble metal NPs, and magnetic NPs, have facilitated significant progress in the development of optical nanobiosensors intended for the detection of EXOs originating from tumors. Following a summary of the biogenesis, biological functions, and biomarker value of known EXOs, this article provides an update on the detection methodologies currently under investigation. In conclusion, we propose some potential enhancements to optical biosensors utilized in detecting EXO, utilizing various NP materials such as silicon NPs, graphene oxide (GO), metal NPs, and quantum dots (QDs).",

            "text": "In the last two decades, gold nanoparticles (AuNP) have attracted extensive interest [1]. AuNP display unique optoelectronic properties [2], which originate from their localized surface plasmon resonances (i.e., collective oscillation of their conduction band electrons when interacting with light of specific wavelengths, Fig. 1A). These optoelectronic properties can be fine-tuned through colloidal chemistry, via engineering nanocrystal size and shape [3]. For example, anisotropic AuNP, such as high aspect ratio gold nanorods, gold nanostars, and thin gold nanoshells, display strong extinction coefficients in the near-infrared region (Fig. 1B) [4][5][6][7], where light shows deeper tissue penetration. As such, AuNP have expanded the medical applications of gold, which historically had been limited to the use of gold salts for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis [8]. In (pre) clinical settings, modern use of AuNP (Fig. 1C) includes point-of-care diagnostics (lateral flow assays, such as pregnancy tests and rapid COVID-19 tests, and surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy [9,10]), in vivo imaging (photoacoustics and computed tomography [11,12]), and therapeutics (photothermal therapy, radiotherapy, catalytic therapy, and drug delivery [13][14][15]). As an example of the latter, AuNP absorbing light in the near-infrared region have been used for thermal ablation of solid tumors, with AuNP converting the energy of the photons into local heat that triggers apoptosis and necrosis of cancerous cells [16]. Furthermore, AuNP profit from ease of synthesis as well as surface functionalization, allowing the conjugation of therapeutic, targeting, and stabilizing agents on their surface [17], and thereby prolonging blood circulation (compared to small molecules) and promoting accumulation at pathological regions, including tumors and sites of inflammation [18,19]. As a result, AuNP have been used as drug carriers for chemotherapeutics, immunomodulatory agents, and nuclei",

Especially, luminescence imaging in the second near-infrared window (NIR-II, 1000-1700 nm), which is also called shortwave infrared region (SWIR), has shown higher resolution at deeper tissue penetration compared with NIR-I (700-1000 nm) window due to the reduced tissue scattering and diminished autofluorescence [43][44][45][46][47][48][49][50][51][52][53][54]. Meanwhile, recent works demonstrate that the autofluorescence of tissue becomes negligible for bioimaging beyond 1500 nm [55,56]. Unfortunately, only a few probes can achieve bioimaging beyond 1500 nm [57,58]. As we know, accurate detection and bioimaging in deep tissue is still hampered by the fact that luminesc",

It begins by highlighting the features of organic fluorophores and their limitations, such as low photostability and the lack of biocompatible dyes emitting wavelengths exceeding 1200 nm. It then delves into various classes of organic fluorophores, such as cyanine dyes, organic electron donors and acceptors, commercial donor-acceptor IR dyes, aggregation-induced emitters, and semiconducting polymer nanoparticles. For each class, specific examples, applications, and challenges are discussed. The section then transitions to inorganic fluorophores, focusing on semiconductor quantum dots, graphene-based materials, single-walled carbon nanotubes, rareearth nanoparticles, nanogolds and gold nanomaterials, and carbon dots. Throughout the discussion, attention is paid to their unique properties, applications, and prospects in NIR-II fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging.",

            "text": "Precise and efficient delivery of nanomedicine to the target site has remained as a major roadblock in advanced cancer treatment. Here, a novel photoacoustic force (PAF)\u2010guided nanotherapeutic system is reported based on a near\u2010infrared (NIR)\u2010absorbing semiconducting polymer (SP), showing significantly improved tumor accumulation and deep tissue penetration for enhanced phototherapeutic efficacy. The accumulation of nanoparticles in 4T1 tumor\u2010bearing mice induced by the PAF strategy displays a fivefold enhancement in comparison with that of the traditional passive targeting pathway, in a significantly shortened time (45 min vs 24 h) with an enhanced penetration depth in tumors. Additionally, a tumor\u2010bearing mouse model is rationally designed to unveil the mechanism, indicating that the nanoparticles enter solid tumors through enhanced transportation across blood vessel barriers via both inter\u2010endothelial gaps and active trans\u2010endothelial pathways. This process is specifically driven by PAF generated from the nanoparticles under NIR laser irradiation. The study thus demonstrates a new nanotherapeutic strategy with low dose, enhanced delivery efficiency in tumor, and boosted therapeutic efficacy, opening new doors for designing novel nanocarriers.",

In one such study, semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPN) were coated with the plasma membrane derived from 4T1 cells to form 4T1 CC-SPN (23). The core SPN absorbed near-infrared (NIR) light that was converted to NIR fluorescence and photoacoustic signals. In addition, SPN can be also used for photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT). Homologous targeting of 4T1 CC-SPN was evaluated in 4T1 tumors. Compared to naked SPN, 4T1 CC-SPN did not show significant enhancement of fluorescence or photoacoustic intensities in 4T1 tumors, indicating that the accumulation of 4T1 CC-SPN in 4T1 tumors was not significantly different from naked SPN. Following phototherapy, the 4T1 CC-SPN group did not show significant difference of tumor growth control in comparison to the naked SPN group. \n\nMany of the homologous targeting studies used uncoated NPs for comparison. If the homologous targeting of CCMCNPs originates from cell surface adhesion molecules, studies with specific inhibitors with competitive binding to these adhesion molecules will provide further insights into the mechanisms underlying the homotypic and heterotypic effects. \n\nSeveral studies have suggested that the CD47 cell surface antigen may suppress the uptake of CCMCNPs by macrophages (27). On the other hand, neoantigens encoded by tumorspecific mutated genes can help elicit tumor-specific immune responses (58). We investigated the pharmacokinetic profiles of CCMF-PLGA NPs and uncoated PLGA NPs in immunodeficient mice and found that CCMF-PLGA NPs had even significantly shorter circulation time in the bloodstream, indicating that the membrane antigens present on CCMF-PLGA NPs may have accelerated clearance (19).",

As compared to organic dyes, nanoparticles are much brighter and need only one light source for excitation. Thus, the fluorescent quantum dots could produce a higher contrast image at a lower cost than organic dyes used as contrast media. But quantum dots are usually made of quite toxic elements. Nanoparticles have a special property of high surface-area-to-volume ratio, which allows various functional groups to get attached to a nanoparticle and thus bind to certain tumour cells. Furthermore, the 10-100 nm size of nanoparticles allows them to preferentially accumulate at tumour sites as tumours lack an effective lymphatic drainage system. Multifunctional nanoparticles can be manufactured that would detect, image and then treat a tumour in future cancer. Nanowires are used to prepare sensor chips, which can detect proteins and other biomarkers left behind by cancer cells and detect and make diagnosis of cancer possible in the early stages from a single drop of a patient's blood.\n\nThe possible applications of various nanosystems in cancer therapy [12]:\n\n\u2022 Carbon nanotubes, with 0.5-3 nm in diameter and length of 20-1000 nm, are used for detection of DNA mutation and for detection of disease protein biomarker.\n\n\u2022 Dendrimers, less than 10 nm in size, are useful for controlled release in drug delivery and as image contrast agents.\n\n\u2022 Nanocrystals, with a size of 2-10 nm, could serve as breast cancer markers.\n\n\u2022 Nanoparticles are of 10-1000 nm in size and can be used in MRI and as contrast agents in ultrasound image formation.\n\n\u2022 Nanoshells find application in tumour-specific imaging and deep tissue thermal ablation.\n\n\u2022 Nanowires are useful for disease protein biomarker detection.\n\n\u2022 Quantum dots with size of 2-10 nm can help in optical visualisation of genes tumour and lymph nodes.",

            "text": "Nanoscale imaging probes such as quantum dots, magnetic nanoparticles, and carbon nanostructures have attracted attention for medical application because of their robust and customizable physical properties. In one class of nanomaterial, upconversion nanoparticle (UCNP)-based nanosensors have been explored for oxygen sensing either as thin films or UCNP core/dense silica nanoparticles [63]. Other fluorescent nanoprobes include water dispersible nanoparticles comprised of \u03c0-conjugated polymers (CPs), which offer an inherent advantage of low-bandgap as compared to typical CPs [64]. In this section we will discuss these and other such inorganic nanoparticle based probes that can provide magnificent opportunities for in vivo imaging. \n\nDue to the enhanced signal that quantum dots (QDs) can provide, as well as their inherent capability to not undergo photobleaching as compared to traditional organic fluorophores, QDs have been applied in recent years to biomedical imaging of hypoxia in deep tissue. In addition, in vitro assessment of oxygen levels have also made use of QDs, specifically a NIR emissive AgInS2/ ZnS QD coupled to a perylene dye [26] has shown to serve as an effective ratiometric probe. The response of the probe towards varying oxygen concentrations in hypoxia was studied using enzymatic oxygen scavenging in water using glucose, glucose oxidase, catalase, and ATP to deoxygenate samples. The probe showed more than a 100% increase in ratiometric signal upon deoxygenation from 6.8 to 0.01 ppm. The ratiometric response of the probe to oxygen concentration was accompanied by emission of the perylene dye at 472 nm (\u03bb max 427 nm) and that of the QD at 775 nm (\u03bb max 365nm) [65].",

            "text": "Currently, the most accurate initial screening modalities for the detection of pancreatic cancer are endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and/or MRI cholangiopancretography (MRCP) (Hekimoglu et al., 2008;Hyodo et al., 2012). The limitation of current imaging-based screens is that upon identification of potentially benign cysts/lesions, subsequent invasive evaluation by collecting tissue biopsies (for example through fine needle aspiration) is still required to confirm diagnosis (Brand, 2001). Early diagnostics to identify carcinomas in situ like PanIN lesions are often challenging due to the detection limit of current radiological methods and how chronic pancreatitis masses show similar pathological aspects (fibrotic stroma) to pancreatic cancer (Erkan et al., 2012a,b). Only cystic tumors are detectable at a pre-invasive stage with conventional radiological methods due to their large size and high contrast compared to the normal pancreas (Erkan et al., 2012a,b). Furthermore, smaller (<1 cm) metastatic tumor deposits in the liver and/or peritoneal cavity may be overlooked by MRI or CT.\n\nTo improve the detection limit of MRI or CT-imaging, an extraneous imaging agent can be administered to the patient to enhance the imaging signals leading to the commercial development of a large range of small organic contrast agents. For example, more than one third of MRI scans are performed in conjunction with a contrast imaging agent. The first generation of organic contrast agents had some limitations (poor specificity and rapid renal clearance) (Roberts, 1997;Kim et al., 2011). To overcome these limitations, contrast agents have been designed in a nanoparticle formulation (Hahn et al., 2011). The incorporation of contrast agents into nanoparticles can offer significant advantages, such as easy functionalization by targeting moieties, higher sensitivity compared to small organic contrast agents and improved biodistribution. For instance, inorganic nanomaterials [including gold nanoparticles, and superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPION)] have been investigated as potential contrast agents for cancer imaging (Godin et al., 2011;Huang et al.,",

Compared to traditional fluorescent dyes and proteins, modified quantum dots and gold nanoparticles possess alternative properties that enhance their imaging capabilities in cells that are fixed before imaging. Additionally, these nanoparticles enable multi-functional analyses of single samples using different forms of detection. Disadvantages of using nanoparticles are relatively minor and are increasingly being circumvented as technologies improve. For example, when conjugated to an antibody and used as a fluorescent tag, a quantum dot may be transformed into a non-fluorescent state upon initial illumination (termed blinking). This blinking may result in a false negative fluorescence reading during shorter periods of illumination. Li-Shishido et al. have demonstrated that this problem may be avoided by increasing the length of time that quantum dots are illuminated prior to recording of fluorescence intensity [52]. In that study, the majority of single dots were in the non-fluorescent state at the beginning of the illumination period, however, a 2-to 3-fold increase in fluorescence was observed after 10 min of illumination. Blinking (as well as bleaching) of the quantum dots was further suppressed in this study adding bmercaptoethanol and glutathione to the sample [52]. Future nanoparticles will likely have an increased number and diversity of properties which will widen the scope of their use as cellular biomarkers [49].",

Recently there have been significant advancements in the formulation and evaluation of organic dyes and nanoparticles that absorb light between 1000-1700 nm, which is known as the NIR-II region. The NIR-II region is noteworthy due to it deeper tissue penetration with PAT, with minimal interference from endogenous tissue components such as hemoglobin and water. Several interesting PAT contrast agents have been developed with NIR-II activity. Additionally, novel genetic probes and activation sensing probes have shown their potential for PAT applications. Inorganic probes. Inorganic probes have the advantage of being highly adjustable in size and absorption bandwidth, and are typically formed from metals or unnatural molecular structures. These customizations allow for alterations that can modulate the optical properties and pharmacokinetic behaviors. Historically, inorganic contrast agents have been used extensively in PAT. In particular, gold and carbon nanotubes have shown great potential for strong PA contrast. One application involved targeting the lymphatic system in mice with an antibody conjugation to the gold plated nanotubes. 174 Another study conjugated a tumor specific peptide to the gold nanorods on the surface of carbon nanotubes to target gastric cancer cells. 175 This technique is potentially generalizable to other types of cancer cells. \n\nGold nanoparticles have historically been used in the NIR-I region. 176 In the longer NIR-II region, improved signal to background ratio (SBR) improves PA imaging. 177 One study with small gold nanorods that absorbed light in the NIR-II region led to strong PA signal in tumors in mice as well as higher thermal stability relative to larger counterparts. With small gold nanorods that absorbed light in the NIR-II region, PAT can image tumors more effectively. Figure 11 shows that peptide targeting in combination with small gold nanorods can be used to effectively image tumors with high contrast. \n\nThe customizability of inorganic probes makes them useful for mapping tumor vasculature using quantum dots comprised of polymers and silver [178][179][180] as well as different polymer coated metal mixtures: Cd, Te, Mn, and Hg. 181,182",

            "text": "As a top-down coating approach, the use of biological materials is able to bestow synthesized nanoparticles with native cell functionalities [25]. In particular, by extracting the entire membrane from single cells and then linking cell membranes components to the surface of nanoprobes, all biologically relevant surface moieties are transferred and maintained for the biomimetic nanoplatform, such as their biocompatibility, retention of cellular properties, and adaptability [26][27][28]. For example, nanoparticles coating with red blood cell membrane can prolong their circulation time and reduce the accelerated blood clearance [29,30]. In addition, it was discovered that nanoprobes coated with active cell membranes can open a new avenue for passing BBB and targeting glioma [31,32]. Therefore, due to the preserved antigen and cell membrane structure, biomimetic nanoprobes can acquire special functions such as ligand recognition and targeting, long blood circulation and immune escape [33], providing a promising way for the diagnosis of brain tumors. \n\nFurther, multifunctional nanoprobes can serve as the contrast agents for high-sensitivity brain tumor detection [31,34]. In particular, semiconducting polymer dots (Pdots) have received extensive attention in biomedicine due to their outstanding biocompatibility, superior photostability, attractive optoelectronic properties, and abundant functional groups [35][36][37]. More importantly, luminescent conjugated polymers with NIR-II fluorescence properties were inspected, which were able to offer significant improvement for real-time imaging and glioma detection [38][39][40]. For example, Wu et al. developed NIR-II aggregation-induced emission (AIE) active Pdots with enhanced NIR-II fluorescence for through-skull mouse-brain imaging [41]. However, Pdots as exogenous materials, are easily identified by the immune system and quickly cleared by the liver and kidney before they can be transported into the brain [42]. Besides, pure Pdots have difficulties in crossing BBB, showing no specific targeting to brain tumor tissue.",

            "text": "Fluorescence imaging techniques are effective tools to noninvasively investigate many fundamental and complex biological processes because they have high signal-to-noise ratios and excellent spatial and temporal resolution. 1,2 The potential of a \ue104uorescence technique is signi\ue103cantly dependent on the \ue104uorophore's property. Thus the development of novel \ue104uorescent probes is of vital importance for further improvement of many \ue104uorescence-based techniques. For in vivo biological applications, near-infrared (NIR) \ue104uorescent probes are highly desirable because of minimal auto-\ue104uorescence interference and high tissue-penetration depth in NIR region due to the weak absorption and scattering of biological species. [3][4][5] The most widely used NIR \ue104uorophores are small-molecule organic dyes (e.g., ICG, Cy7, Atto 740 and Alexa 750). 6 However, low brightness, small Stokes shi\ue09d and limited photostability of these NIR dyes are limiting factors for practical biological imaging applications.\n\nAmong the strides made in nanotechnology, inorganic semiconductor quantum dots (Qdots) with unique size-tunable emission were introduced to biological studies nearly 20 years ago as \ue104uorescent probes. [7][8][9] However, the release of heavy metal ions is a signi\ue103cant concern for living systems. Alternatively, organic dyes can be doped into nanoparticles such as silica and latex beads, [10][11][12][13] which exhibit improved brightness and photostability when compared with molecular dyes alone. In certain cases, nanoparticles with some size range and surface functional groups are promising for applications, such as for sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) mapping, because they have a long blood-circulation time. [14][15][16][17][18] However, the usefulness of dyeloaded nanoparticles is severely limited by the low \ue104uorophore concentration and possible dye leaching problems.\n\nSemiconducting polymer dots (Pdots) are emerging as organic \ue104uorescent nanoparticles with high brightness, large Stokes shi\ue09d, and intriguing energy-transfer properties.

There are numerous types of nanoparticles that enable detection of pre-cancerous cells, a fragment of viruses, specific proteins, antibodies and other markers and indicators of disease [48]. Quantum dots, very small semiconductor particles, hold potential for creating disease detection systems that are more sensitive and accurate [2]. The utilization of novel sensors and lab-on-a-chip concepts based on nanotubes, nanowires, cantilevers or atomic force microscopy for diagnostic purposes improve the sensitivity and enable faster and more accurate diagnostics alongside reduced costs. For example, carbon nanotubes and gold nanoparticles used in sensors enable the detection of oral cancer indicators; nanoparticles called NanoFlares are used to discover cancerous cells in the bloodstream; and silver nanorods in a diagnostic system hold potential for separating viruses, bacteria and other microscopic elements of blood samples, etc. Furthermore, in vivo imaging can be performed using nanoparticle contrast agents, mainly for MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) and ultrasound, or using miniature imaging devices like a pill containing a miniature video system that takes pictures throughout the whole digestive system. Iron oxide nanoparticles, thanks to their unique size and half-life, have proven to be the adequate contrast agent for improved detail in MRI, particularly for more accurate diagnosis of problems associated with the circulatory system [10]. Perfluorocarbon emulsion nanoparticles (PFC) help to increase the contrast of the image created by ultrasonography, improving its quality. This is of particular interest in medicine because ultrasonography is more economical than other noninvasive imaging technologies and can help with diagnosis, particularly when imaging tumors [10]. The utilization of fluorescent platinum nanoclusters as new biocompatible bioimaging probes for diagnostic purposes has been presented in [18]. Platinum nanomaterials have also been used for making molecular machines and motion-based detection methods. A more detailed analysis of diagnostic and therapeutic techniques using nanoparticles is performed in [20].",

Inorganic nanoparticles, e.g., quantum dots (QDs), possess luminescence properties and are employed as a novel tool for the diagnosis of biological functions and disease progress . In addition, they have a strong fluorescent property under ultraviolet light illumination. The major application of QDs is to image tissues and cells, e.g., lymph nodes and tumors (Helle et al., 2012). However, the other types of nanoparticles possess superparamagnetic iron oxide potential; therefore they are recognized to detect cancer cells and their progression such as in prostate cancer (Sterenczak et al., 2012). Furthermore, gold and silver nanoparticles are very commonly used for the diagnosis of various cancer cell types such as skin, ovarian, pancreatic, breast, and lung cancer (Austin et al., 2014;Patra et al., 2010;Swanner et al., 2015).",

            "text": "Hybrid polymer SCs contain photoactive layers comprising at least two components each with a distinct chemical composition. For this discussion one component is an organic semiconducting polymer and the other is an inorganic semiconducting nanoparticle (NP). 1][152][153] The blending of the NPs with the polymer matrix can be achieved either by mixing, 154 linking both components together 155 or by in situ NP growth. 156,157 One-pot preparation methods have also been used. 158 The term nanocrystal (NC) is used here to describe  nanometre-sized crystals; whereas, nanorods (NRs) represents rod-shaped nanometre-sized particles. NP is used to encompass NC and NR or nanometre-sized particles of arbitrary shape. \n\nSemiconducting NCs and NRs are also known as quantum dots and quantum rods, respectively. The \ue103rst demonstration of a hybrid polymer SC was by Alivisatos et al. 159 A design aim for hybrid polymer SCs is to use the high a values for semiconducting NPs to provide acceptors that strongly contribute to J sc . Semiconductor NPs typically have a values of about 160 10 5 cm \u00c01 , which gives absorption lengths of about 100 nm. The latter value is within the thickness range of hybrid polymer SC photoactive layers. 1 The high a values for NPs can extend to near-IR wavelengths, which is an additional advantage for hybrid SCs. \n\nSemiconducting NPs can be prepared using solution based methods (i.e., solvothermal methods). Their synthesis procedures allow \ue103ne control of the NP size and this, in turn, allows \ue103ne control of their a values, energy levels 161,162 and E g values. Moreover, the NP synthesis can o\ue09den be simply modi\ue103ed to enable preparation of NRs 163 and other geometries 164 which means that there is design \ue104exibility afforded by NPs that is not present for fullerenes. Whilst NCs (Fig. 10(a)) and NRs (Fig. 10(b)) are common other morphologies have been used in hybrid polymer SCs.",

The delivery efficiency of nanoparticles to the target tumor site is affected by several factors including tumor-specific-targeting efficiency, circulation time and biodistribution of nanoparticles in body, and these factors are highly governed by the size, shape, surface coating and charge of nanoparticles. [137] ecently, Wilhelm et al. conducted a multivariate analysis on the compiled data (the identified 224 relevant manuscripts were obtained from SciFinder and Google Scholar databases using \"nanoparticle delivery\" as a search term from 2005 to 2015) and revealed how the physicochemical parameters of nanoparticles (e.g., materials, size, shape, and surface charge), tumor models, and cancer types affect the delivery efficiency (%ID, defined as the percentage of nanoparticles that reached the target tumor compared to the injected dose (ID)) of nanoparticles. [138] ccording to this, inorganic materials, such as gold, iron oxide, silica and quantum dots, showed higher %ID than organic materials, such as liposomes, polymers, hydrogels and dendrimers (0.8 and 0.6%ID for inorganic and organic materials, respectively).

            "text": "Consequently, the noble metal-organic nanocomposite-based biosensor exhibited higher sensitivity than the bare noble metal nanoparticle-based biosensor (Matsumura et al., 2018). \n\nNoble metal nanoparticles also exhibit a localized SPR (LSPR) property induced by the collective oscillation of electrons in resonance with the incident light frequency. Because of the LSPR property, the noble metal nanoparticles have been used for the signal enhancement of fluorescent inorganic quantum dots (QD) influenced by the adjacent metallic nanoparticles. Due to the easy fabrication process, high sensitivity, and high fluorescence enhancing effect, noble metal nanoparticlebased LSPR-fluorescence-biosensor has been developed in virus sensing fields. \n\nFor example, Nasrin et al. used the surface plasmon effect of AuNPs for the fluorescent detection of the influenza virus (Nasrin et al., 2020). When the distance between the QD and AuNP was the optimal length of the linker peptide, AuNPs could enhance the fluorescent properties of QDs due to the surface plasmon effect of AuNPs. When the virus was bound to the linker peptides, the fluorescence activity was quenched by steric hindrance on the LSPR behavior. Nasrin et al. used this method and detected the influenza virus in a range of 10 \u221214 -10 \u22129 g/mL with a detection limit of 1.7 \u00d7 10 \u22122 pg/mL (Figure 1D). \n\nSERS is a powerful tool for detecting viruses because it enables label-free, highly sensitive detection. Noble metal nanomaterials have been used as a SERS-active probe because of their unique SPR property inducing substantial SERS enhancement (Lee and Choi, 2019). Maneeprakorn et al. used star-shaped AuNPs (AuNS), which had multi-arms and surface roughness for detecting the influenza A virus (Maneeprakorn et al., 2016).",

A variety of nanostructures can be employed for this purpose, including diverse metallic, organic, inorganic, and polymeric materials in the form of dendrimers, micelles, liposomes, quantum dots, nanoparticles, antibody-drug conjugates, and more [15,16,43]. A promising approach is represented by metal-based nanoparticles that can carry and deliver hydrophobic PSs to tumoral tissues through the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect [8,29,65,66]. Compared to conventional photosensitizers, metalbased nanoparticles have a long cycle time, slow degradation, targeted and controllable release, being advantageous for PDT [8]. \n\nDue to its low toxicity, inertness, and good biocompatibility, gold is one of the preferred materials among metallic nanoparticles. Moreover, its affinity towards thiol and amine groups allows facile surface functionalization with ligands like antibodies, proteins, nucleic acids, and carbohydrates [14,29,67,68]. Gold nanocages, nanorods, and nanoshells are considered brilliant photo-response structures, capable of sensitizing singlet oxygen formation and generating ROS that can destroy cancer cells [69]. Gold nanoclusters were reported as effective delivery vehicles for clinically approved PSs, providing spatiotemporal control and diminishing undesirable side effects [70]. \n\nSilver is another material of interest in PDT because, besides its ability to generate singlet oxygen, it also has antimicrobial properties [14,64,[71][72][73]. Ag nanoparticles' large specific area increases the contact area between this material and bacteria or viruses, thus enhancing its bactericidal effect. Moreover, when being used as nanocontainers of PSs, Due to its low toxicity, inertness, and good biocompatibility, gold is one of the preferred materials among metallic nanoparticles.",

            "text": "Tumor hyperthermia therapy employs various techniques such as ultrasound, microwave, radiofrequency, and magnetic field to heat tumor tissue. This treatment approach demonstrates a higher specificity towards tumors due to their inherent heat tolerance, but the therapy efficacy is limited because the damage to adjacent healthy tissues should be minimized (Gon\u00e7alves et al., 2020). Photothermal therapy (PTT) has emerged as a promising solution to overcome this challenge by utilizing photothermal agents to precisely heat the targeted area and restrict thermal damage to the tumor tissue. However, the effectiveness of PTT relies on improved light absorption and enhanced photothermal conversion efficiency (Wang et al., 2020b). Noble metal nanoparticles, commonly employed as photothermal agents for in vivo therapy, offer a less invasive experimental technique that ensures effective cancer treatment (Huang et al., 2006). The efficacy of PTT depends on two primary factors: i) the light source, such as lasers, which enable deeper tissue penetration by emitting light in the spectral range of 650-900 nm, and ii) lightabsorbing nanoparticles that facilitate photothermal ablation through efficient conversion of light into heat within picosecond timescales (Chen et al., 2007). These nanoparticles exhibit strong absorption in the near-infrared (NIR) region of the electromagnetic spectrum, particularly in the range of 650-900 nm, due to their surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect, and notably, the absorption coefficient of nanoparticles is 4-5 times higher than that of photothermal dyes owing to their SPR characteristics (Jain et al., 2008). Spherical gold nanoparticles typically exhibit their maximum SPR absorption peak in the visible spectrum, around 520 nm. Huang et al. identified gold nanorods as effective photothermal agents due to their longitudinal absorption bands in the NIR region resulting from SPR oscillation (Huang et al., 2010). Specifically, smalldiameter gold nanorods are preferred as NIR photothermal converters for in vivo applications due to their high absorption cross-section beyond the tissue absorption spectrum.",

[2] anoparticles are materials sized within 1-100 nm that have unique properties compared to their molecular or bulk counterparts. [3] Nanoparticles are broadly classified into organic and inorganic subtypes (Table 2). Organic nanoparticles include polymers, liposomes, and dendrimers, whereas inorganic nanoparticles include gold, iron oxide, silica, and quantum dots. As this is a non-exhaustive list, readers are referred to reviews on nanoparticles elsewhere. [4] Due to this diversity in composition, nanoparticles represent a versatile platform that can be tailored for specific applications including imaging and drug delivery. As exemplified by applications in tumor imaging and therapeutics, nanoparticles have numerous advantageous properties. First, the shape, size, and surface charge of nanoparticles can be easily altered to optimize for drug delivery kinetics and biodistribution. [3] Second, nanoparticles can enhance drug accumulation at the target tumor site. [5] Due to the abnormal, leaky tumor vasculature, nanoparticles can passively accumulate at the tumor over time. Incorporation of polyethylene glycol (PEG) into nanoparticles can prolong circulation half-life of a drug, compared to the free drug, and further enhance tumor accumulation. Through functionalization of a nanoparticle with a targeting ligand, nanoparticles can specifically target tumor cells to promote tumor cell internalization. [6] Third, nanoparticles can mediate controlled release of their cargo in response to environmental stimuli. [7] These \"smart\" nanoparticles can release their payload in the presence of enzymes, changes in pH, or redox, as well as to external stimuli, such as temperature or light. Fourth, nanoparticles can serve as both therapeutic and diagnostic (\"theranostic\") agents. [8]",

            "text": "ROS are highly reactive molecules formed by the reaction of molecular oxygen with electrons and include O 2 -, H 2 O 2 , -OH, and 1 O 2 (singlet oxygen) [176]. They have been implicated in the etiology of dozens of disease states as well as normal biological functions [177][178][179]. Because their presence can be linked to both the onset and progression of many diseases, they are powerful targets for monitoring pathogenesis in real-time and measuring therapeutic effects. \n\nIn 2014, initial steps were taken to develop real-time probes of pathogenesis in the form of semiconducting \u03c0-conjugated polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) [180]. These agents are NIR-active nanoparticles capable of generating bright PA signal. Because of their stability towards ROS, they were conjugated to a cyanine dye (IR775S), sensitive to oxidation by ROS, allowing for spectral differentiation between various ROS. It was shown in murine macrophage cells that activated SPNs could return to their normal state when their environment was no longer saturated with ROS illustrating the real-time monitoring potential for these agents. The SPNs were subsequently proven to highlight regions of increased ROS production in murine models of acute edema. Importantly, these agents could undergo signal evolution following a molecular event, making them activatable. An example of a ROS-sensitive, activatable nanoparticle was demonstrated in 2018here, a silver-coated gold nanorod was used for simultaneous imaging and treatment of bacterial infection [172]. In this strategy, the PA signal from gold was initially quenched while coated with silver, but was gradually turned on as the silver was etched and released by ROS into sites of infection, exerting bactericidal effects. Activatable probes differentiate themselves from many of the agents used for guided surgeries, which are typically based on accumulation at a target site (relying on the EPR effect) with signal-to-noise ratios proportional to their concentration differences between target and background tissue. \n\nAnother activatable probe was recently developed for peroxynitrite.",

As shown in Figure 7D, human vascular endothelial cells (HVECs) were specifically labeled compared to the smooth muscular cells, and active targeting to HVECs has been achieved by a simple modification of polymeric MB by shell CS-GP cross-linking. \n\nBiomedical photonics has become an interdisciplinary and rapidly developing field, and is also an important part of the research in the frontier fields of life science and medical imaging. The multimodal light converters of NIR semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) was designed, and the molecular engineering and nanoscale functionalization of SPNs make it a biological photon and a multifunctional biological photonic crystal nanometer platform (Figure 8). 23 SPNs have promoted the development of biophotonics from ultra-sensitive afterglow imaging and PA imaging activated by deep tissue to photothermal regulation of biomolecular activity and self-regulating phototheranostics. \n\nFor example, an afterglow probe activated only in the presence of biothiols, which was used for early detection of drug-induced hepatotoxicity in living mice. Because of their unique afterglow mechanism, SPNs with a diameter of less than 40 nm acted as a simple accumulation agent for tissue imaging, and also as an intelligent activatable probe to report the pathological processes in living animals. 24 The afterglow intensity of SPNs is more than 100-fold brighter than inorganic afterglow agents, and the signal is detectable through the body of a live mouse.",

            "text": "According to the last EU Commission Recommendation 2022/3689, nanomaterials are constituted of solid particles, which have one or more external dimensions in the size range 1 nm to 100 nm. Indeed, the size of nanoparticles typically ranges from some tens to hundreds of nanometers, while semiconductor nanoparticles termed Quantum Dots (QDs) have a size below 10 nm. In other words, a \"quantum size regime\" but not a nm size regime is characteristic for QDs [1]. Due to this size constraint, QDs tend to show quantum confinement effects when the size becomes less than the Bohr excitonic radius. This leads to multiplying applications since, for example, the band gap is tunable with respect to changes in particle size [2,3]. These optical properties, and particularly the ability to emit fluorescence in a much more stable manner than organic fluorophores [4], make them a prime candidate for dynamic imaging, particularly in the context of fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS). FGS is a real-time intraoperative technique in surgical oncology aiming to highlight tumors during surgical resection to facilitate tumor resection and achieve negative tumor margins [5][6][7]. Complete tumor resection with negative margins is critical for improving a patient's prognosis [8]. In addition, QDs can emit fluorescence in the near infrared (NIR) range, which represents a real interest for FGS. Indeed, the NIR window is characterized by a deeper light penetration [9] and a reduced tissue autofluorescence [10], thus improving imaging conditions. To achieve tumor accumulation, different approaches are possible, as illustrated in Figure 1. In brief, delivery could be achieved through QDs properties (size, charge, surface modifications, etc.) or enhanced by active targeting. Alternately, QDs could be encapsulated in larger nanoparticles, themselves modified for active targeting. accumulation, different approaches are possible, as illustrated in Figure 1.

Thus, the development of nanotechnology-based strategies for an efficient brain uptake and controlled release of the active compounds is essential. The characteristics of the nanocarriers mostly depend on the cancer type, tumor characteristics, stage, and location [78]. \n\nNovel approaches for the diagnosis of brain cancer involve the use of nanoparticles, liposomes, micelles, and quantum dots for various neuroimaging techniques. Therefore, silica shells doublecoated with semiconducting polymer layers were synthesized for fluorescence and photoacoustic brightness imaging [79]. Moreover, phosphonate polyethylene glycol and cyclo RGD functionalized iron-oxide nanoparticles [80] or bovine serum albumin and tumor-specific folic acid [81] functionalized iron-oxide nanoparticles were applied for magnetic resonance imaging. Another strategy for the diagnosis of glioblastoma involves coating gold nanoparticles with the CBP4 peptide for an enhanced binding to the CD133 biomarker [82]. Furthermore, liposomes incorporating heptamethine cyanine dye IR780 [46] and iron-oxide nanoparticles and a near-infrared fluorescence dye [83] were studied for near-infrared fluorescence imaging and magnetic resonance imaging. Magnetic resonance imaging using gadolinium-incorporated micelles was used for the quantitative hemorrhage-risk evaluation due to the correlation between the extravasation of micelles and the hemorrhagic edema site [84]. Another study focused on the use of polyethylene glycol-coated quantum dots as neuroimaging systems at the tumor site through IVIS imaging system. However, to acquire the images, it was necessary to remove the skulls of the mice [85]. \n\nStudies regarding the treatment of brain cancer focused on the delivery of various anti-cancer drugs using nanocarriers.",

Fluorescent nanoparticles like quantum dots (QDs) [81], upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) [82], long persistent nanomaterials and metal nanoclusters exhibit significant advantages over organic dyes and fluorescent proteins in terms of signal brightness [83,84], photostability, and low background noise. As a result, they have been investigated for fluorescence sources in nucleic acid detection with enhanced precision and sensitivity. Moreover, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), magnetic nanoparticles (Fe 3 O 4 ), and photonic crystals can produce colorimetric signals through volume changes or aggregation in response to external stimuli, commonly utilized as visual detection signals in nucleic acid POCT detection. Based on the ability of magnetic relaxation switches, Fe 3 O 4 can also directly serve as a signal visualizer for nucleic acid detection. In addition, AuNPs, gold nanorods (AuNRs), platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs), prussian blue nanoparticles (PBs) and carbon nanotubes can generate thermal signals [85] under near-infrared laser irradiation, enabling their application in vitro diagnostic scenarios when combined with thermal imaging technology [86,87].",

            "text": "Conventional polymerization methods used to modify the surface of nanoparticles with polymers are not compatible with semiconductor nanoparticles. For example, anionic conditions are too severe for use in the presence of the quantum dots, and radicals generated by conventional radical polymerization (e.g., azo-bisisobutyronitrile initiated) degrade the nanoparticles and quench their photoluminescence. One of the first attempts for the surface modification of quantum dots came from Patten and Farmer who encapsulated CdS quantum dots in a silica shell and polymerized PMMA chains from the silica surface by ATRP [258]. These hybrid nanoparticles were casted into films which retained the photoluminescence of the precursor CdS nanoparticles and showed good dispersion of the polymer-coated CdS/SiO 2 hybrids throughout the PMMA matrix. However, the latter advances in CRP techniques, which are accompanied with low radical concentrations, have allowed the growth of functional polymers from the surface of quantum dots. \n\n\"Unprotected\" quantum dots without the intermediate silica layer have been used lately as substrates for the development of core-shell hybrids providing an intimate connection of the polymer to the nanoparticle core. Sill and Emrick reported the NMP synthesis of PS homopolymer and PS-co-PMMA copolymer chains from the surface of CdSe nanoparticles pre-functionalized with initiating molecules bearing phosphine oxide derivatives as the anchor groups [259]. The PS-coated CdSe nanoparticles not only showed a uniform dispersion in a polystyrene matrix but also exhibited enhanced fluorescence compared to the initiator functionalized particles due to their thermal treatment during the polymerization. At the same time a range of well-defined styrenes and (meth)acrylate homopolymers, random and block copolymers were grown by the RAFT technique from the surface of CdSe nanoparticles modified with trithiocarbonate moieties [260]. Upon surface modification with the polymeric stabilizers the particles maintained their optical properties without the requirement for a protective inorganic shell.",

Thus, noble metals are now widely used to create tumor targeting agents. Golden, silver and platinum nanoparticle delivery systems showed pronounced antitumor efficacy towards in vitro and in vivo tumor models [94][95][96][97][98] and represented themselves as a potent tumor imaging agents [99,100]. Highly fluorescent quantum dots, up-conversion nanoparticles, carbon-based nanoparticles are the promising tool for fluorescence guided drug delivery [101][102][103][104][105]. To engage the magnetic resonance imaging, superparamagnetic nanoparticles of iron oxides can be employed [106][107][108][109]. Porous inorganic materials are also being developed as containers for therapeutic or imaging compounds [102,[110][111][112].

Thus, the development of nanotechnology-based strategies for an efficient brain uptake and controlled release of the active compounds is essential. The characteristics of the nanocarriers mostly depend on the cancer type, tumor characteristics, stage, and location [78]. \n\nNovel approaches for the diagnosis of brain cancer involve the use of nanoparticles, liposomes, micelles, and quantum dots for various neuroimaging techniques. Therefore, silica shells double-coated with semiconducting polymer layers were synthesized for fluorescence and photoacoustic brightness imaging [79]. Moreover, phosphonate polyethylene glycol and cyclo RGD functionalized iron-oxide nanoparticles [80] or bovine serum albumin and tumor-specific folic acid [81] functionalized iron-oxide nanoparticles were applied for magnetic resonance imaging. Another strategy for the diagnosis of glioblastoma involves coating gold nanoparticles with the CBP4 peptide for an enhanced binding to the CD133 biomarker [82]. Furthermore, liposomes incorporating heptamethine cyanine dye IR780 [46] and iron-oxide nanoparticles and a near-infrared fluorescence dye [83] were studied for near-infrared fluorescence imaging and magnetic resonance imaging. Magnetic resonance imaging using gadolinium-incorporated micelles was used for the quantitative hemorrhage-risk evaluation due to the correlation between the extravasation of micelles and the hemorrhagic edema site [84]. Another study focused on the use of polyethylene glycol-coated quantum dots as neuroimaging systems at the tumor site through IVIS imaging system. However, to acquire the images, it was necessary to remove the skulls of the mice [85]. \n\nStudies regarding the treatment of brain cancer focused on the delivery of various anti-cancer drugs using nanocarriers.",

            "text": "Because of the increasing cancer incidence worldwide, the realization of accurate diagnosis and treatment of cancer needs extensive research [1][2][3][4]. The difficulty lies in how to accurately distinguish between normal cells and tumor cells. Traditional clinical methods include computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [5][6][7]. Among them, CT has the advantages of good resolution, but its limitation lies in radiation problems and high cost [8]. The safety of MRI is a considerable advantage, but the lack of sensitivity and artifacts caused by motion are its disadvantages [9]. PET shows higher sensitivity and quantitative detection than both methods do, but the problems of cost and limited instruments need to be solved [10]. In this context, fluorescence imaging technology enables tumor monitoring and real-time guidance during surgery with ideal imaging effect, which reduces ionizing radiation and radiation damage and is helpful for overcoming the problems of high technical cost and limited instrument use, especially in terms of sensitivity and specificity at the cellular level [11,12]. To date, a variety of fluorescent nanomaterials have been applied in fields such as biological imaging, tumor diagnosis and tumor treatment [13][14][15]. Traditional agents, including porphyrins, phthalocyanines and other organic dyes, are limited by easy photobleaching and long-term photoactivation [16][17][18]. Thus, novel fluorescent nanomaterials of carbon quantum dots and gold nanorods with sufficient optical stability have been developed for anti-tumor treatment [19,20]. However, their limited luminescence time makes eliminating the interference of spontaneous fluorescence background in practical applications difficult, which limits the further application of long-term and real-time imaging [21]. Fortunately, persistent luminescence nanoparticles (PLNPs), which can store the energy generated by the excitation source and continue to release the energy gradually after the excitation has stopped, show great promise for application as fluorescent probes for biological imaging [22].",

Nanotechnology appears balanced to provide devices, capable of sensitive and specific anatomic, molecular and biologic imaging; selective therapy of tumors; and low toxicity, resulting in a significant improvement over the current standard of care. [21] lti-functionality is the key advantage of Nanoparticles over traditional approaches. Targeting ligands, imaging labels, therapeutic drugs, and many other functional modalities can be integrated into the Nanoparticles to allow for targeted molecular imaging and molecular therapy of cancer. [22] The nanomaterials have the inherent advantage of possessing unique functional properties for cancer detection and treatment. Nanomaterial is classified in the size domain of proteins and cells. Hence, they have been used as biological tags by interfacing the Nanoparticles with biocompatible molecules (biological, small organic molecules or bioinorganic interface). [23] ifferent kinds of Nanoparticles suitable for drug and gene delivery probing DNA structures, etc., exist. They include liposomes, polymeric Nanoparticles (Nanoshperes and nanocapsules, solid lipid particles, nanocrystals, polymer therapeutics such as dendrimers, fullerenes and inorganic Nanoparticles, e.g., gold and magnetic Nanoparticles). \n\nDendritic polymeric nano devices can detect cancer cells, identify cancer signature, and provide targeted delivery of anti-cancer therapeutics. [24] Carbon nanotubes scan down DNA, and look for single nucleotide polymorphism. \n\nNanowires having the unique properties of selectivity and specificity, can be designed to sense molecular markers of malignant cells. Nanoparticles contrast agents are being developed for tumor detection purposes such as nuclear magnetic resonance imaging. [24] ereas several Nanoparticles have been developed, plasmonic gold Nanoparticles appear interesting because of their facile surface chemistry, relatively limited toxicity, and novel optimal properties useful for concurrent imaging and therapy. Gold nanotechnology brings forth ultra sensitive optical imaging and multiple therapeutic options that may be used in unison.",

Importantly, amphiphilic polymer coated quantum dots conjugated to streptavidin are now commercially available [56].\n\nEmbedded biosensors, such as electrochemical glucose sensors, avoid the problems of clearance, but must still minimize immunogenicity and scar tissue formation around the implantation site [57]. The recent development of polymeric \"smart\" coatings may minimize the foreign body response via local elution of anti-inflammatories [25]. In addition, advances in miniaturization and wireless power and data transmission promise to reduce the invasiveness of many electrochemical in vivo sensors [33].\n\nThe most outstanding issues facing optical sensors involve reliable and accurate detection of signals in vivo. Tissues and biological fluids are relatively opaque to visible light, limiting the depth to which signals may be non-invasively monitored. In addition, autofluorescence from tissues and the environment compound the difficulty of sensitive and specific sensing [58]. Advances in the generation of molecular probes with wavelengths in the infrared range, often facilitated by nanotechnology, will doubtlessly extend the range and application of optical sensors [59][60][61]. Improvements in sensor design, sensitivity, and miniaturization also have clear roles in expanding the ease with which optical sensors may be applied to clinical sensors.\n\nA major challenge inherent in the use of nanoparticle-based sensors is signal amplification. Ghosh et al recently used the bacteriophage M13 as a scaffold to display targeting ligands and numerous nanoparticles for the detection of cancer cells in mice. The multivalent binding of the bacteriphage scaffold coupled with the capability of targeting a larger number of nanoparticles to the tumor lead to significantly improved sensitivity and selectivity [62]. Furthermore, the Bhatia lab recently developed a novel solution to this problem by engineering nanoparticles that can \"communicate\" in vivo to amplify tumor targeting [63]. In this elegant system, nanoparticles target tumor sites where they then locally activate the coagulation cascade to broadcast tumor location to clot-targeting nanoparticles. This project lays the foundation for novel future technologies that may take advantage of endogenous signaling",

[64][65][66][67][68][69][70] Despite the promise of SPNs in the \ue103eld of cancer theranostics, some limitations still need to be overcome. The preparation of water-soluble SPNs is limited by encapsulating hydrophobic SPs into amphiphilic copolymers through nanoprecipitation. [71][72][73] Thus, such SPNs are in principle binary micelles. According to previous studies, micelles may dissociate in the blood circulation as the concentration of micelles may decrease signi\ue103cantly below the critical micelle concentration (CMC) in such an environment. 74 In addition, interactions with protein and other biological substances in the circulation may accelerate the micelle dissociation, leading to aggregation of hydrophobic SPs and poor biodistribution of nanoparticles. 75,76 Therefore, approaches to preparing structurally stable SPNs are highly desired.\n\nTo overcome the disadvantages of SPNs, gra\ue09ded semiconducting polymer amphiphiles (SPAs) are designed and synthesized.

Quantum dots that emit fluorescence in the near infrared region and have better tissue penetration has been used in combination with tumor specific biological probes (peptides, antibodies and other small molecules) for improved imaging, while silver-rich Ag2Te quantum dots that provides a better spatial resolution has also been used for tumor imaging. 64,65 milarly, gold nano particles a good contrast agent with better biocompatibility and nanoshells have also been used for imaging of tumor tissue for early detection of malignancy. 66 Nanotechnology has also been used to assess the tumor microenvironment be exploiting the typical response of fluorescent nanoprobes to pH that helps in the detection of fibroblast activated protein-\u03b1 in the tumorassociated fibroblasts. 67 The recent development of MXene based biosensors with high conductivity and superior fluorescent, optical, and plasmonic properties have been found be promising for the detection of cancer biomarkers due to their high sensitivity (femtomolar range for detection). a common method that relies on the expression and upregulation of tumor specific antigens from the cancerous cells in order to make a diagnosis. 84 Monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies are tagged with fluorescent dyes to directly target these antigens, and then the tissue in question is viewed under a microscope to identify the areas marked by the fluorescence. 84 This method of imaging is growing in popularity due to its specificity as the antibodies can be altered in order to target antigens expressed by very specific forms of cancer. 84 For example, if a neuroendocrine tumor is suspected, IHC can be performed using antibodies that target the chromogranin antigen; a positive result indicates the presence of neuroendocrine cells within the tumor, and the brightness of the fluorescence approximates what portion of the tumor is composed of these cells. 85",

            "text": "Polymer nanoparticles are solid spherical particles composed of polymer materials obtained through monomer polymerization, polymer dispersion, or selfassembly of amphiphilic polymers [241,242]. Polymer nanoparticles possess the advantage of biodegradability, which is essential for the sustained release of TCM active ingredients. Their surface engineering versatility enables controlled drug release and active tumor targeting, particularly in cancer treatment, where they hold significant application value [243]. Xu et al. explored a HA-modified polydopamine (PDA) nanocarrier loaded with ursolic acid and ASIV for combined chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and photothermal therapy of lung cancer (Fig. 4D-F) [160]. HA targets the CD44 receptor on tumor cell surfaces, enhancing drug accumulation within the tumor. This nanoparticle not only releases drugs to inhibit tumor growth and improve antitumor immunity but also enhances treatment efficacy through photothermal effects. Xiong et al. constructed PEGylated poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles encapsulating Astragalus polysaccharide and gold nanorods, combined with focused ultrasound technology for breast cancer treatment [163]. The study demonstrated that these nanoparticles not only effectively delivered drugs to tumor sites but also served as contrast agents for tumor detection. Zhu et al. developed a T7 peptide-modified nanoparticle based on carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS) for co-delivery of docetaxel and curcumin, aiming to enhance the chemoimmunotherapy against lung cancer [169]. This nanoparticle specifically targets the transferrin receptor (TfR) overexpressed on lung cancer cells and precisely releases drugs in response to pH and ROS levels.",

            "text": "Thus, the reasonable integration of PTT-induced hyperthermia with CO-based gas therapy provides an ideal candidate for cancer phototheranostics. Besides, it is critically necessary to achieve a controllable release of CO to both mitigate toxic side effects and improve the efficacy of targeting lesions [43][44][45]. Compared to endogenous stimuli (such as pH, H 2 O 2 , and GSH) present within the tumor microenvironment, NIR-II light-activatable strategies have garnered significant interest due to their advantages in spatiotemporal controllability, deep tissue penetration, and minimal photodamage [46][47][48][49]. Therefore, it is an extremely feasible strategy to develop NIR-II light-responsive CO-based photothermal nanoplatforms to achieve the greatly optimized tumor treatment effect. \n\nOrganic semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs), featured with high-\u03c0 conjugated frameworks composed of aromatic rings or double bonds, have emerged as ideal candidates for engineering NIR-II nanomaterials [50][51][52][53][54]. Compared with inorganic nanomaterials or organic small-molecular dyes, SPNs own a more stable structure, superior light-harvesting capacity, and higher biocompatibility, which have been widely harnessed for biological applications [55][56][57]. Given the restriction of preparation process, the majority of reported SPNs utilized in biomedical applications were formulated via the nanoprecipitation process involving multifunctional amphiphilic surfactants [58][59][60][61]. Such obtained SPNs suffer from poor stability under physiological conditions, thus leading to off-target effects and posing an inevitable side effect [62][63][64]. Besides, the prepared SPNs through nanoprecipitation are susceptible to severe aggregation, thereby compromising the imaging sensitivity and therapeutic efficacy to cancer theranostics.",

            "text": "Abstract. Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is a fast growing deep-tissue imaging modality. However, light scattering and absorption in biological tissues limit imaging depth. Short near-infrared wavelengths (650 to 950 nm) are widely used for PAI. Using longer near-infrared wavelengths reduces scattering. We demonstrate deep-tissue contrast-enhanced in vivo photoacoustic imaging at a wavelength of 1064 nm. An ultranarrow bandgap semiconducting polymer poly (thienoisoindigo-alt-diketopyrrolopyrrole) (denoted as PIGD) is designed and demonstrated for imaging at 1064 nm. By embedding colloidal nanoparticles (NPs) of PIGD in chicken-breast tissue, an imaging depth of \u223c5\u2009\u2009cm is achieved. Intravenous injection of PIGD NPs in living rats showed brain vascular images with \u223c2 times higher contrast compared with the brain vascular images without any contrast agent. Thus, PIGD NPs as an NIR-II contrast agent opens new opportunities for both preclinical and clinical imaging of deep tissues with enhanced contrast.",

Optical agents are generally involved in biophotonics to interpret biomolecular events into readable optical signals for imaging and diagnosis or to convert photons into other forms of energy (such as heat, mechanical force, or chemical radicals) for therapeutic intervention and biological stimulation. Development of new optical agents including metallic nanoparticles, quantum dots, up-conversion nanoparticles, carbon dots, and silica nanoparticles has contributed to the advancement of this field. However, most of these agents have their own merits and demerits, making them less effective as multimodal biophotonic platforms. In this Account, we summarize our recent work on the development of near-infrared (NIR) semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) as multimodal light converters for advanced biophotonics. SPNs are composed of \u03c0-electron delocalized semiconducting polymers (SPs) and often possess the advantages of good biocompatibility, high photostability, and large absorption coefficients. Because the photophysical properties of SPNs are mainly determined by the molecular structures of the precursor polymers, molecular engineering allows us to fine tune their photophysical processes to obtain different optical responses, even to light in the second NIR window (1000-1700 nm). Meanwhile, the facile nanoformulation methods of SPNs enable alteration of their outer and inner structures for diverse biological interactions. The unique photophysical properties of SPNs have brought about ultrasensitive deep-tissue molecular imaging. NIR-absorbing SPNs with strong charge-transfer backbones can convert photoenergy into mechanical acoustic waves, permitting photoacoustic imaging that bypasses the issue of light scattering and reaches the centimeter tissue penetration depth. Differently, phenylenevinylene-containing SPNs can store photon energy via chemical defects and emit long-NIR afterglow luminescence with a half-life of \u223c6 min after cessation of light excitation. Such an afterglow process avoids tissue autofluorescence, giving rise to ultrahigh signal-to-background ratios. So far, SPN-based molecular photoacoustic or afterglow probes have been developed to image disease tissues (tumors), biomarkers (biothiols and reactive oxygen species), and physiological indexes (pH and temperature) in different preclinical animal models. The synthetic flexibility of SPNs further permits light-modulated biological and therapeutic interventions. Till now, SPNs with high photothermal conversion efficiencies have been shaped into photothermal transducers to remotely regulate biological events including protein ion channels, enzymatic activity, and gene expression. In conjunction with the desired biodistribution and tumor-homing ability, SPNs have been doped or coated with other inorganic agents for amplified photothermal or self-regulated photodynamic cancer therapy.

We herein report an intraparticle molecular orbital engineering approach to simultaneously enhance photoacoustic brightness and photothermal therapy efficacy of semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) for in vivo imaging and treatment of cancer. The theranostic SPNs have a binary optical component nanostructure, wherein a near-infrared absorbing semiconducting polymer and an ultrasmall carbon dot (fullerene) interact with each other to induce photoinduced electron transfer upon light irradiation. Such an intraparticle optoelectronic interaction augments heat generation and consequently enhances the photoacoustic signal and maximum photothermal temperature of SPNs by 2.6- and 1.3-fold, respectively. With the use of the amplified SPN as the theranostic nanoagent, it permits enhanced photoacoustic imaging and photothermal ablation of tumor in living mice. Our study thus not only introduces a category of purely organic optical theranostics but also highlights a molecular guideline to amplify the effectiveness of light-intensive imaging and therapeutic nanosystems."

Optical agents are generally involved in biophotonics to interpret biomolecular events into readable optical signals for imaging and diagnosis or to convert photons into other forms of energy (such as heat, mechanical force, or chemical radicals) for therapeutic intervention and biological stimulation. Development of new optical agents including metallic nanoparticles, quantum dots, up-conversion nanoparticles, carbon dots, and silica nanoparticles has contributed to the advancement of this field. However, most of these agents have their own merits and demerits, making them less effective as multimodal biophotonic platforms. In this Account, we summarize our recent work on the development of near-infrared (NIR) semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) as multimodal light converters for advanced biophotonics. SPNs are composed of \u03c0-electron delocalized semiconducting polymers (SPs) and often possess the advantages of good biocompatibility, high photostability, and large absorption coefficients. Because the photophysical properties of SPNs are mainly determined by the molecular structures of the precursor polymers, molecular engineering allows us to fine tune their photophysical processes to obtain different optical responses, even to light in the second NIR window (1000-1700 nm). Meanwhile, the facile nanoformulation methods of SPNs enable alteration of their outer and inner structures for diverse biological interactions. The unique photophysical properties of SPNs have brought about ultrasensitive deep-tissue molecular imaging. NIR-absorbing SPNs with strong charge-transfer backbones can convert photoenergy into mechanical acoustic waves, permitting photoacoustic imaging that bypasses the issue of light scattering and reaches the centimeter tissue penetration depth. Differently, phenylenevinylene-containing SPNs can store photon energy via chemical defects and emit long-NIR afterglow luminescence with a half-life of \u223c6 min after cessation of light excitation. Such an afterglow process avoids tissue autofluorescence, giving rise to ultrahigh signal-to-background ratios. So far, SPN-based molecular photoacoustic or afterglow probes have been developed to image disease tissues (tumors), biomarkers (biothiols and reactive oxygen species), and physiological indexes (pH and temperature) in different preclinical animal models. The synthetic flexibility of SPNs further permits light-modulated biological and therapeutic interventions. Till now, SPNs with high photothermal conversion efficiencies have been shaped into photothermal transducers to remotely regulate biological events including protein ion channels, enzymatic activity, and gene expression. In conjunction with the desired biodistribution and tumor-homing ability, SPNs have been doped or coated with other inorganic agents for amplified photothermal or self-regulated photodynamic cancer therapy. This Account thus demonstrates that SPNs serve as a multimodal biophotonic nanoplatform to provide unprecedented opportunities for molecular imaging, noninvasive bioactivation, and advanced therapy.",

However, most dual PTT need to use two lasers for heat generation, which brings about inconvenience and limitation to the experimental operations. Herein, we report the development of \u201cnanococktail\u201d nanomaterials (DTPR) with 808 nm-activated image-guided dual photothermal properties for optimized cancer therapy. Methods: In this work, we co-encapsulated AIEgens (TPA-BDTO, T) and SPs (PDPPP, P) by using maleimide terminated amphiphilic polymer (DSPE-PEG2000-Mal, D), then further conjugated the targeting ligands (RGD, R) through \u201cclick\u201d reaction. Finally, such dual PTT nanococktail (termed as DTPR) was constructed. Results: Once DTPR upon irradiation with 808 nm laser, near-infrared fluorescence from T could be partially converted into thermal energy through fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between T and P, coupling with the original heat energy generated by the photothermal agent P itself, thus resulting in image-guided dual PTT. The photothermal conversion efficiency of DTPR reached 60.3% (dual PTT), much higher as compared to its inherent photothermal effect of only 31.5% (single PTT), which was further proved by the more severe photothermal ablation in vitro and in vivo upon 808 nm laser irradiation. Conclusion: Such smart \u201cnanococktail\u201d nanomaterials could be recognized as a promising photothermal nanotheranostics for image-guided cancer treatment.",

Thus, the SPs exhibit great potentials for photothermal therapy (PTT) and photoacoustic imaging (PAI). However, poor understanding of the underlying mechanisms and the correlation between the SP polymer chemical structures and their performances of PTT and PAI have significantly hindered their biomedical application. Herein, a series of acceptor-\u03c0-acceptor type (A1-\u03c0-A2) type SPs were synthesized. The diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) and thiophene are used as A1 electron accepting block and \u03c0-bridge, and the chemical structure of A2 unit was variable. The SPs were formulated into PEGylated nanoparticles, which ensured these SP-based nanoparticles (SP@NPs) exhibited similar size, shape, and physiological stability. Thus, the chemical structure of A2 unit was the only variable. The effects of the SP chemical structures are carefully and comprehensively evaluated through both in vitro and in vivo experiments. Our results demonstrated the chemical structure of A2 unit simultaneously impact their absorption spectra and photothermal (PT) conversion efficiency, which finally determined their PTT and PAI performances. Among these A2 acceptors, thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT) unit exhibited the best in vitro and in vivo anticancer efficacies and PAI performances. This study not only provides molecular insights into the design of efficient SPs for PTT and PAI but also highlights the flexibility and potential of SP@NPs for biomedical application. Thus, SP@NPs can act as a versatile nanoplatform for the development of novel light intensive imaging and therapeutic approaches.",

This review summarizes the recent progress of organic phototheranostic agents with an emphasis on the main strategies to manipulate the three excitation energy dissipation pathways, namely, radiative decay, thermal deactivation, and intersystem crossing, with the assistance of a Jablonski diagram, which particularly showcases how the Jablonski diagram has been guiding the design of organic agents from molecule to aggregate levels to promote the disease phototheranostic outcomes. Molecular design and nanoengineering strategies to modulate photophysical processes of organic optical agents to convert the absorbed photons into fluorescent/phosphorescent/photoacoustic signals and/or photodynamic/photothermal curing effects for improved disease phototheranostics are elaborated. Noteworthily, adaptive phototheranostics with activatable and transformable functions on demand, and regulation of excitation such as chemiexcitation to promote the phototheranostic efficacies are also included.

One key factor for effective BNCT is to aggregate an adequate concentration (>20 ppm) of 10B in the cytoplasm of the tumor. Carborane-loaded polymer nanoparticles are promising because of their outstanding biocompatibility and plasma steadiness. In this study, a new class of carborane-loaded nanoscale covalent organic polymers (BCOPs) was prepared by a Schiff base condensation reaction, and their solubility was greatly improved in common solvents via alkyl chain engineering and size tailoring. The obtained BCOP-5T was further functionalized by biocompatible 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[amino(polyethylene-glycol)-2000] (DSPE-PEG, molecular weight 2000) to form stable aqueous-phase nanoparticles with a hydrodynamic diameter of around 100 nm. After chelating with radioactive copper-64, DSPE-BCOP-5T was tracked by positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and showed significant accumulation in the tumor. DSPE-BCOP-5T + neutron radiation showed remarkable tumor suppression in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice (murine breast cancer). No obvious physical tissue damage and abnormal behavior were observed, demonstrating that the boron delivery was successful and tumor-selective.

Such completely organic nanoagents consist of \u03c0\u2010conjugated yet oxidizable optical polymer as PA generator and hydrolyzable amphiphilic polymer as particle matrix to provide water solubility. The obtained SPNs are readily degraded by myeloperoxidase and lipase abundant in phagocytes, transforming from nonfluorescent nanoparticles (30 nm) into NIR fluorescent ultrasmall metabolites (\u22481 nm).

However, the lack of oxygen supply in the hypoxic tumor site obviously restricts the generation of singlet oxygen (1 O2 ), thus limiting the efficacy of PDT. So far, the strategies to improve PDT efficacy usually rely on complicated nanosystems, which require sophisticated design or complex synthetic procedure. Herein, iodine-rich semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPN-I) for enhanced PDT, using iodine-induced intermolecular heavy-atom effect to elevate the 1 O2 generation, are designed and prepared. The nanoparticles are composed of a near-infrared (NIR) absorbing semiconducting polymer (PCPDTBT) serving as the photosensitizer and source of fluorescence signal, and an iodine-grafted amphiphilic diblock copolymer (PEG-PHEMA-I) serving as the 1 O2 generation enhancer and nanocarrier. Compared with SPN composed of PEG-b-PPG-b-PEG and PCPDTBT (SPN-P), SPN-I can enhance the 1 O2 generation by 1.5-fold. In addition, SPN-I have high X-ray attenuation coefficient because of the high density of iodine in PEG-PHEMA-I, providing SPN-I the ability of use with computed tomography (CT) and fluorescence dual-modal imaging. The study thus provides a simple nanotheranostic platform composed of two components for efficient CT/fluorescence dual-modal imaging-guided enhanced PDT.",

Herein, we developed a molecular design strategy to boost the brightness of NIR-II SPNs: structure planarization and twisting. By integration of the strong absorption coefficient inherited from planar \u03c0-conjugated units and high solid-state quantum yield (\u03a6PL) from twisted motifs into one polymer, a rise in brightness was obtained. The resulting pNIR-4 with both twisted and planar structure displayed improved \u03a6PL and absorption than the planar polymer pNIR-1 and twisted polymer pNIR-2. Given the emission tail extending into the NIR-IIa region (1300-1400 nm) of pNIR-4 nanoparticles, NIR-IIa fluorescence imaging of blood vessels with enhanced clarity was observed. Moreover, a pH-responsive poly(\u03b2-amino ester) made pNIR-4 specifically accumulate at tumor sites, allowing NIR-IIa fluorescence image-guided cancer precision resection. This study provides a molecular design strategy for developing highly bright fluorophores.",

Nevertheless, the limitations of conventional inorganic PA contrast agents and the narrow range of the excitation wavelength in the first near-infrared (NIR-I) window hamper the applications of PA imaging in living subjects. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of a second near-infrared (NIR-II) absorptive organic semiconducting polymer (OSP)-based nanoprobe (OSPN+) for PA imaging and tracking of stem cells. Comparison studies in biological tissue show that NIR-II light excited PA imaging of the OSPN+ has significantly higher signal-to-noise ratio than NIR-I light excited PA imaging, thereby demonstrating the superiority of the OSPN+ for deep tissue imaging. With good biocompatibility, appropriate size, and optimized surface property, the OSPN+ shows enhanced cellular uptake for highly efficient PA labeling of stem cells. In vivo investigations reveal significant NIR-II PA contrast enhancement of the transplanted OSPN+-labeled human mesenchymal stem cells by 40.6- and 21.7-fold in subcutaneous and brain imaging, respectively, compared with unlabeled cases. Our work demonstrates a class of OSP-based nanomaterials for NIR-II PA stem cell imaging to facilitate a better understanding and evaluation of stem cell-based therapies."

Endogenous chromophores present in the body such as hemoglobin, lipid, melanin, and so on provide strong photoacoustic contrast due to their strong light absorption in certain optical window. To enhance the performance of PAI further, researchers have developed several exogenous contrast agents such as metallic nanoparticles, carbon-based nanomaterials, quantum dots, organic small molecules, semiconducting polymer nanoparticles, and so on. These exogenous contrast agents not only help improving the imaging contrast, but also make targeted molecular imaging possible. In this review article, we first discuss the state-of-the-art PAI techniques with endogenous contrast mechanism. Later, we provide an overview of recent progress in the development of exogenous photoacoustic contrast agents for in vivo imaging applications. Finally, we present the pros/cons of the existing PA contrast agents along with future challenges of contrast agent-based PAI for biomedical applications.

Although many exogenous contrast agents have been developed for PA imaging and PTT, the design guidelines to amplify their imaging and therapy performances remain challenging and are highly demanded. Semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) composed of polymers with \u03c0-electron delocalized backbones can be designed to amplify their PA imaging and PTT performance, because of their clear structure-property relation and versatility in modifying their molecular structures to tune their photophysical properties. This review summarizes the recent advances in the photoacoustic imaging and photothermal therapy applications of semiconducting polymer nanoparticles with a focus on signal amplification and second near-infrared (NIR-II, 1000-1700\u00a0nm) construction. The strategies such as structure-property screening, fluorescence quenching, accelerated heat dissipation, and size-dependent heat dissipation are first discussed to amplify the PA brightness of SPNs for in vivo PA. The molecular approaches to shifting the absorption of SPNs for NIR-II PA imaging and PTT are then introduced so as to improve the tissue penetration depth for diagnosis and therapy. At last, current challenges and perspectives of SPNs in the field of imaging and therapy are discussed.",

However, some types of cancer exhibited a low response rate to immunotherapy, and the high risk of immune-related side effects has been aroused during immunotherapy, which greatly restrict its broad applications in cancer therapy. Phototherapy that uses external light to trigger the therapeutic process holds advantages including high selectivity and efficiency, and low side effects. Recently, it has been proven to be able to stimulate immune response in the tumor region by inducing immunogenic cell death (ICD), the process of which was termed photo-immunotherapy, dramatically improving therapeutic specificity over conventional immunotherapy in several aspects. Among numerous optical materials for photo-immunotherapy, semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) have gained more and more attention owing to their excellent optical properties and good biocompatibility. In this review, we summarize recent developments of SPNs for immunotherapy and imaging of immunoactivation. Different therapeutic modalities triggered by SPNs including photo-immunotherapy and photo-immunometabolic therapy are first introduced. Then, applications of SPNs for real-time monitoring immunoactivation are discussed. Finally, the conclusion and future perspectives of this research field are given."

Organic semiconducting materials (OSMs) composed of \u03c0-conjugated building blocks as the optically active components have recently emerged as a promising category of biophotonic agents. OSMs possess common features including excellent optical properties, good photostability and biologically benign composition. This review summarizes the recent progress in the development of OSMs based on small-molecule fluorophores, aggregation-induced emission (AIE) dyes and semiconducting oligomer/polymer nanoparticles (SONs/SPNs) for advanced biophotonic applications. OSMs have been exploited as imaging agents to transduce biomolecular interactions into second near-infrared fluorescence, chemiluminescence, afterglow or photoacoustic signals, enabling deep-tissue ultrasensitive imaging of biological tissues, disease biomarkers and physiological indexes. By fine-tuning the molecular structures, OSMs can also convert light energy into cytotoxic free radicals or heat, allowing for effective cancer phototherapy. Due to their instant light response and efficient light-harvesting properties, precise regulation of biological activities using OSMs as remote transducers has been demonstrated for protein ion channels, gene transcription and protein activation. In addition to highlighting OSMs as a multifunctional platform for a wide range of biomedical applications, current challenges and perspectives of OSMs in biophotonics are discussed."

Endogenous chromophores present in the body such as hemoglobin, lipid, melanin, and so on provide strong photoacoustic contrast due to their strong light absorption in certain optical window. To enhance the performance of PAI further, researchers have developed several exogenous contrast agents such as metallic nanoparticles, carbon-based nanomaterials, quantum dots, organic small molecules, semiconducting polymer nanoparticles, and so on. These exogenous contrast agents not only help improving the imaging contrast, but also make targeted molecular imaging possible. In this review article, we first discuss the state-of-the-art PAI techniques with endogenous contrast mechanism. Later, we provide an overview of recent progress in the development of exogenous photoacoustic contrast agents for in vivo imaging applications. Finally, we present the pros/cons of the existing PA contrast agents along with future challenges of contrast agent-based PAI for biomedical applications.

Their unique properties, such as efficient photothermal conversion, excellent photostability, and strong NIR absorption, make them ideal for deep brain imaging. Different donoracceptor systems have been explored to enhance their PA affects and stability, resulting in nanoparticles that can cross the BBB and provide clear PA signals with low toxicity. The copolymer NPs (pentathiophene donors and benzobisthiadiazole acceptors), Dithieno pyrrole copolymers, and Metabolizable NIR-II PA contrast agents encapsulated with PLGA-PEG showed effective brain vasculature imaging and signal persistence. Among them, PDI NPs stood out for their strong NIR absorption and efficient photothermal conversion. With donor-acceptor feature, these PDI NPs provide robust PA signals, especially when modified with DSPE-mPEG5000. PDI have demonstrated significant PA signal enhancement under 700 nm laser irradiation with orthotopic glioblastoma."

                            "Optical imaging has played a pivotal role in biology and medicine, but it faces challenges of relatively low tissue penetration and poor signal\u2010to\u2010background ratio due to light scattering and tissue autofluorescence. To overcome these issues, second near\u2010infrared fluorescence, self\u2010luminescence, and photoacoustic imaging have recently emerged, which utilize an optical region with reduced light\u2013tissue interactions, eliminate real\u2010time light excitation, and detect acoustic signals with negligible attenuation, respectively. Because there are only a few endogenous molecules absorbing or emitting above the visible region, development of contrast agents is essential for those deep\u2010tissue optical imaging modalities. Organic semiconducting agents with \u03c0\u2010conjugated frameworks can be synthesized to meet different optical imaging requirements due to their easy chemical modification and legible structure\u2013property relation. Herein, the deep\u2010tissue optical imaging applications of organic semiconducting agents including small\u2010molecule agents and nanoparticle derivatives are summarized. In particular, the molecular engineering and nanoformulation approaches to further improve the tissue penetration and detection sensitivity of these optical imaging modalities are highlighted. Finally, current challenges and potential opportunities in this emerging subfield of biomedical imaging are discussed."

Differently, phenylenevinylene-containing SPNs can store photon energy via chemical defects and emit long-NIR afterglow luminescence with a half-life of \u223c6 min after cessation of light excitation. Such an afterglow process avoids tissue autofluorescence, giving rise to ultrahigh signal-to-background ratios."

                            "PAI can overcome the traditional optical penetration limitations (e.g., fluorescence imaging) since it detects phonons rather than photons under light excitation, providing superior spatial resolution, high contrast, and deep tissue penetration [7,[9][10][11]. To date, various optical agents have been developed for PAI/PTT theranostics, including small molecule dyes, metallic nanoparticles, and carbon nanomaterials [12][13][14][15][16]. Nevertheless, small molecule dyes usually suffer from photobleaching, while metallic nanoparticles encounter severe biotoxicity and carbon nanomaterials have broad PAI spectra without a specific wavelength and a low extinction coefficient for PAI and PTT [17,18]. Semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) characterized by \u03c0-\u03c0 electron delocalized backbones and easy exciton diffusion along the backbone represent a new PAI/PTT agent with good photostability, high extinction coefficient, and excellent photothermal conversion efficiency [1,5]. As SPNs are fabricated from biologically inert organic compounds, they can inherently avoid of heavy metal ion-induced toxicity to tissues and thus possess good biocompatibility [19]."

                            "Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a promising technique for cancer therapy, providing good therapeutic efficacy with minimized side effect. However, the lack of oxygen supply in the hypoxic tumor site obviously restricts the generation of singlet oxygen (1 O2 ), thus limiting the efficacy of PDT. So far, the strategies to improve PDT efficacy usually rely on complicated nanosystems, which require sophisticated design or complex synthetic procedure. Herein, iodine-rich semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPN-I) for enhanced PDT, using iodine-induced intermolecular heavy-atom effect to elevate the 1 O2 generation, are designed and prepared. The nanoparticles are composed of a near-infrared (NIR) absorbing semiconducting polymer (PCPDTBT) serving as the photosensitizer and source of fluorescence signal, and an iodine-grafted amphiphilic diblock copolymer (PEG-PHEMA-I) serving as the 1 O2 generation enhancer and nanocarrier. Compared with SPN composed of PEG-b-PPG-b-PEG and PCPDTBT (SPN-P), SPN-I can enhance the 1 O2 generation by 1.5-fold. In addition, SPN-I have high X-ray attenuation coefficient because of the high density of iodine in PEG-PHEMA-I, providing SPN-I the ability of use with computed tomography (CT) and fluorescence dual-modal imaging. The study thus provides a simple nanotheranostic platform composed of two components for efficient CT/fluorescence dual-modal imaging-guided enhanced PDT."

                            "In the past few years, conjugated polymer nanoparticles (CPNs) have been successfully prepared and applied in the biological field because of their unique opto-electronic properties. The rapid development of CPNs is mainly attributed to their simple synthesis procedures and easy separation steps. The advantages of CPNs include high brightness, excellent photostability, low cytotoxicity, high quantum yield and versatile surface modification. The functionalization of CPNs with specific recognition elements imparts them good ability for targeted recognition and imaging in vitro and in vivo. CPNs can be applied to deliver drug and gene, and simultaneously to real-time monitor the release process due to their self-luminous characteristics. Moreover, CPNs can sensitize oxygen molecules to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) which can kill adjacent bacteria and tumor cells. In this tutorial review, we provide a recent development of the preparation methods, properties, and functionalization strategies of CPNs, especially discussing their biological applications in targeted imaging, drug/gene delivery and biomedicine. The challenges and outlooks in this field will also be discussed."

                            "Photoacoustic (PA) imaging in the second near\u2010infrared (NIR\u2010II) window (1000\u20131700 nm) holds great promise for deep\u2010tissue diagnosis due to the reduced light scattering and minimized tissue absorption; however, exploration of such a noninvasive imaging technique is greatly constrained by the lack of biodegradable NIR\u2010II absorbing agents. Herein, the first series of metabolizable NIR\u2010II PA agents are reported based on semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs). Such completely organic nanoagents consist of \u03c0\u2010conjugated yet oxidizable optical polymer as PA generator and hydrolyzable amphiphilic polymer as particle matrix to provide water solubility. The obtained SPNs are readily degraded by myeloperoxidase and lipase abundant in phagocytes, transforming from nonfluorescent nanoparticles (30 nm) into NIR fluorescent ultrasmall metabolites (\u22481 nm). As such, these nanoagents can be effectively cleared out via both hepatobiliary and renal excretions after systematic administration, leaving no toxicity to living mice. Particularly these nanoagents possess high photothermal conversion efficiencies and emit bright PA signals at 1064 nm, enabling sensitive NIR\u2010II PA imaging of both subcutaneous tumor and deep brain vasculature through intact skull in living animals at a low systematic dosage. This study thus provides a generalized molecular design toward organic metabolizable semiconducting materials for biophotonic applications in NIR\u2010II window."

For instance, fullerene doping in SPNs (SPN-F) amplifies PA signals through intraparticle photoinduced electron transfer, enhancing nonradiative heat generation upon light irradiation. This approach has shown significant improvements in tumor imaging capabilities in vivo. <Paper corpusId=\"16042807\" paperTitle=\"(Wang et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"206700172\" paperTitle=\"(Lyu et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper> Additionally, SPNs can be engineered with specific structures like donor-acceptor systems to enhance their PA effects and stability, making them ideal for challenging applications such as brain tumor imaging. <Paper corpusId=\"276809915\" paperTitle=\"(Rizwan et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nSPNs also demonstrate impressive capabilities in afterglow luminescence imaging, where they can emit long-lasting NIR signals after cessation of light excitation. Phenylenevinylene-containing SPNs can store photon energy via chemical defects and emit NIR afterglow luminescence with a half-life of approximately 6-7 minutes. <Paper corpusId=\"51905347\" paperTitle=\"(Jiang et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"253047831\" paperTitle=\"(Yoon et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"253276007\" paperTitle=\"(Wu et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> This afterglow process avoids tissue autofluorescence, resulting in remarkably high signal-to-background ratios of up to 291, which is 67 times larger than that of conventional NIR fluorescence when detecting signals through thick tissue. <Paper corpusId=\"253047831\" paperTitle=\"(Yoon et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nFurthermore, SPNs can be utilized as reactive oxygen species (ROS) imaging agents, which is valuable for studying various pathological processes including strokes, tumor metastasis, bacterial infections, and cardiomyopathy. <Paper corpusId=\"17310914\" paperTitle=\"(Zou et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper> Their structural flexibility and narrow PA spectral profiles enable the development of ratiometric PA probes for in vivo real-time imaging of ROS. <Paper corpusId=\"4107691\" paperTitle=\"(Pu et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nIn summary, the superior optical and imaging properties of SPNs, including enhanced photoacoustic signal generation, excellent photostability, and ability to function in both NIR imaging windows, make them highly effective for deep-tissue tumor detection compared to traditional inorganic nanoparticles. <Paper corpusId=\"265298479\" paperTitle=\"(Sridharan et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"211045352\" paperTitle=\"(Upputuri et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>",

To fully utilize this potential, PA molecular imaging probes have to be developed. Herein we introduce near infrared (NIR) light absorbing semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) as a new class of contrast agents for PA molecular imaging. SPNs can produce stronger signal than commonly used single-wall carbon nanotubes and gold nanorods on a per mass basis, permitting whole-body lymph node PA mapping in living mice at a low systematic injection mass. Furthermore, SPNs possess high structural flexibility, narrow PA spectral profiles, and strong resistance to photodegradation and oxidation, which enables development of the first NIR ratiometric PA probe for in vivo real-time imaging of reactive oxygen species\u2014vital chemical mediators of many diseases. These results demonstrate SPNs an ideal nanoplatform for developing PA molecular probes."

The wavelength range 650-1,000 nm of NIR fluorescence imaging is known as the first NIR window (NIR-I), which can achieve a tissue penetration depth of up to \u22481 cm (Shanmugam et al., 2014). However, when NIR-I light passes through or interacts with the tissue, it still suffers from light scattering, tissue absorption, and autofluorescence (Ntziachristos, 2010), leading to a relatively poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and thus is less ideal for deep-tissue imaging. To enhance the imaging depth, the second near-infrared window (NIR-II, 1,000-1,700 nm), a more ideal region with deeper tissuepenetration depth and fewer light-tissue interactions, has been explored recently (Miao et al., 2018)(Cai et al., 2019)."

                            "The optical technology presents non-invasive, non-destructive, and non-ionizing features and has the ability to display various chemical components in tissues to provide useful information for various biomedical applications. Regarding selection of light wavelengths, second near-infrared (NIR-II, 900-1700 nm) light is a much better choice compared to both visible (380-780 nm) and traditional near-infrared (780-900 nm) light, because of its advantages including deeper penetration into biological tissues, less tissue scattering or absorption, and decreased interference by fluorescent proteins. Thus, using optical nano-agents that absorb or emit light in the NIR-II window can achieve deeper tissue optical imaging with higher signal-to-background ratios and better spatial resolution for diagnosis. What's more, some of these nano-agents can be further applied for imaging guided surgical removal, real-time monitoring of drug delivery, labeling lymphatic metastasis, biosensing, and imaging guided phototherapy. In this review, we attempt to summarize the recent advances of various NIR-II nano-agents (including single-walled carbon nanotubes, quantum dots, rare-earth doped nanoparticles, other inorganic nanomaterials, small organic molecule-based nanoparticles, and semiconducting polymer nanoparticles) in both bioimaging and therapeutic applications, and discuss the challenges and perspectives of these nano-agents for clinical practice in the near future."

                            "Pu et al. developed a fullerene doped semiconducting polymer nanoparticle (SPN-F) that can amplify the PA signal through the intraparticle photoinduced electron transfer (Lyu et al., 2016). As shown in Figure 13A, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) are -3.5 and -4.9 eV for semiconducting polymer and -4.3 and -6.5 eV for fullerene, respectively. Therefore, the semiconducting polymer and fullerene play their roles as electron donor and acceptor, respectively, leading to quenched fluorescence and enhanced nonradiative heat generation upon light irradiation, ultimately achieve amplified PAI signal. As shown in Figure 13B and C, with increasing amount of fullerene doped (SPN-Fx, x: the weight percentages of fullerene), the PA intensity obviously increased. The amplified PA signals of SPNs have also been demonstrated in vivo. As shown in Figure 13D and E, compared to SPN-F0 injected mice, the mice injected with SPN-F20 exhibited much higher PA signals in the tumor at all the time points."

                            "Optical theranostic nanoagents that seamlessly and synergistically integrate light-generated signals with photothermal or photodynamic therapy can provide opportunities for cost-effective precision medicine, while the potential for clinical translation requires them to have good biocompatibility and high imaging/therapy performance. We herein report an intraparticle molecular orbital engineering approach to simultaneously enhance photoacoustic brightness and photothermal therapy efficacy of semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) for in vivo imaging and treatment of cancer. The theranostic SPNs have a binary optical component nanostructure, wherein a near-infrared absorbing semiconducting polymer and an ultrasmall carbon dot (fullerene) interact with each other to induce photoinduced electron transfer upon light irradiation. Such an intraparticle optoelectronic interaction augments heat generation and consequently enhances the photoacoustic signal and maximum photothermal temperature of SPNs by 2.6- and 1.3-fold, respectively. With the use of the amplified SPN as the theranostic nanoagent, it permits enhanced photoacoustic imaging and photothermal ablation of tumor in living mice. Our study thus not only introduces a category of purely organic optical theranostics but also highlights a molecular guideline to amplify the effectiveness of light-intensive imaging and therapeutic nanosystems."

Their unique properties, such as efficient photothermal conversion, excellent photostability, and strong NIR absorption, make them ideal for deep brain imaging. Different donoracceptor systems have been explored to enhance their PA affects and stability, resulting in nanoparticles that can cross the BBB and provide clear PA signals with low toxicity. The copolymer NPs (pentathiophene donors and benzobisthiadiazole acceptors), Dithieno pyrrole copolymers, and Metabolizable NIR-II PA contrast agents encapsulated with PLGA-PEG showed effective brain vasculature imaging and signal persistence. Among them, PDI NPs stood out for their strong NIR absorption and efficient photothermal conversion. With donor-acceptor feature, these PDI NPs provide robust PA signals, especially when modified with DSPE-mPEG5000. PDI have demonstrated significant PA signal enhancement under 700 nm laser irradiation with orthotopic glioblastoma."

Dioxetane formation was intrinsically determined by substituent groups of the phenylenevinylene (PPV) polymer's vinyl bonds, and the PPV-SPNs could generate the necessary reactive 1 O 2 for AL emission following light irradiation. Incorporation of NIR-absorbing 1 O 2 sensitizer, NCBS5, facilitated recharged AL in deep tissue for longitudinal in vivo imaging. Thus, SPN-NCBS5 permitted rapid and highly sensitive lymph node and tumor imaging."

(Yu et al., 2012) Therefore, with a good control of surface chemistry and versatile modifications of functional groups, enormous SPNs have emerged as contrast agents for cell labeling and PAI. (Mallidi et al., 2011) SPNs can be further developed into NIR ratiometric nanoprobes for in vivo imaging of reaction oxygen species (ROS).

                            "Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is a noninvasive hybrid imaging modality offering rich optical contrast and high depth-to-resolution ratio deep-tissue imaging. Endogenous chromophores present in the body such as hemoglobin, lipid, melanin, and so on provide strong photoacoustic contrast due to their strong light absorption in certain optical window. To enhance the performance of PAI further, researchers have developed several exogenous contrast agents such as metallic nanoparticles, carbon-based nanomaterials, quantum dots, organic small molecules, semiconducting polymer nanoparticles, and so on. These exogenous contrast agents not only help improving the imaging contrast, but also make targeted molecular imaging possible. In this review article, we first discuss the state-of-the-art PAI techniques with endogenous contrast mechanism. Later, we provide an overview of recent progress in the development of exogenous photoacoustic contrast agents for in vivo imaging applications. Finally, we present the pros/cons of the existing PA contrast agents along with future challenges of contrast agent-based PAI for biomedical applications.

Differently, phenylenevinylene-containing SPNs can store photon energy via chemical defects and emit long-NIR afterglow luminescence with a half-life of \u223c6 min after cessation of light excitation. Such an afterglow process avoids tissue autofluorescence, giving rise to ultrahigh signal-to-background ratios."

                            "Optical imaging has played a pivotal role in biology and medicine, but it faces challenges of relatively low tissue penetration and poor signal\u2010to\u2010background ratio due to light scattering and tissue autofluorescence. To overcome these issues, second near\u2010infrared fluorescence, self\u2010luminescence, and photoacoustic imaging have recently emerged, which utilize an optical region with reduced light\u2013tissue interactions, eliminate real\u2010time light excitation, and detect acoustic signals with negligible attenuation, respectively. Because there are only a few endogenous molecules absorbing or emitting above the visible region, development of contrast agents is essential for those deep\u2010tissue optical imaging modalities. Organic semiconducting agents with \u03c0\u2010conjugated frameworks can be synthesized to meet different optical imaging requirements due to their easy chemical modification and legible structure\u2013property relation. Herein, the deep\u2010tissue optical imaging applications of organic semiconducting agents including small\u2010molecule agents and nanoparticle derivatives are summarized. In particular, the molecular engineering and nanoformulation approaches to further improve the tissue penetration and detection sensitivity of these optical imaging modalities are highlighted. Finally, current challenges and potential opportunities in this emerging subfield of biomedical imaging are discussed."

                            "PAI can overcome the traditional optical penetration limitations (e.g., fluorescence imaging) since it detects phonons rather than photons under light excitation, providing superior spatial resolution, high contrast, and deep tissue penetration [7,[9][10][11]. To date, various optical agents have been developed for PAI/PTT theranostics, including small molecule dyes, metallic nanoparticles, and carbon nanomaterials [12][13][14][15][16]. Nevertheless, small molecule dyes usually suffer from photobleaching, while metallic nanoparticles encounter severe biotoxicity and carbon nanomaterials have broad PAI spectra without a specific wavelength and a low extinction coefficient for PAI and PTT [17,18]. Semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) characterized by \u03c0-\u03c0 electron delocalized backbones and easy exciton diffusion along the backbone represent a new PAI/PTT agent with good photostability, high extinction coefficient, and excellent photothermal conversion efficiency [1,5]. As SPNs are fabricated from biologically inert organic compounds, they can inherently avoid of heavy metal ion-induced toxicity to tissues and thus possess good biocompatibility [19]."

                            "Photoacoustic (PA) imaging and photothermal therapy (PTT) have attracted extensive attention in disease diagnosis and treatment. Although many exogenous contrast agents have been developed for PA imaging and PTT, the design guidelines to amplify their imaging and therapy performances remain challenging and are highly demanded. Semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) composed of polymers with \u03c0-electron delocalized backbones can be designed to amplify their PA imaging and PTT performance, because of their clear structure-property relation and versatility in modifying their molecular structures to tune their photophysical properties. This review summarizes the recent advances in the photoacoustic imaging and photothermal therapy applications of semiconducting polymer nanoparticles with a focus on signal amplification and second near-infrared (NIR-II, 1000-1700\u00a0nm) construction. The strategies such as structure-property screening, fluorescence quenching, accelerated heat dissipation, and size-dependent heat dissipation are first discussed to amplify the PA brightness of SPNs for in vivo PA. The molecular approaches to shifting the absorption of SPNs for NIR-II PA imaging and PTT are then introduced so as to improve the tissue penetration depth for diagnosis and therapy. At last, current challenges and perspectives of SPNs in the field of imaging and therapy are discussed."

                            "Immunotherapy that stimulates the body's own immune system to kill cancer cells has emerged as a promising cancer therapeutic method. However, some types of cancer exhibited a low response rate to immunotherapy, and the high risk of immune-related side effects has been aroused during immunotherapy, which greatly restrict its broad applications in cancer therapy. Phototherapy that uses external light to trigger the therapeutic process holds advantages including high selectivity and efficiency, and low side effects. Recently, it has been proven to be able to stimulate immune response in the tumor region by inducing immunogenic cell death (ICD), the process of which was termed photo-immunotherapy, dramatically improving therapeutic specificity over conventional immunotherapy in several aspects. Among numerous optical materials for photo-immunotherapy, semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) have gained more and more attention owing to their excellent optical properties and good biocompatibility. In this review, we summarize recent developments of SPNs for immunotherapy and imaging of immunoactivation. Different therapeutic modalities triggered by SPNs including photo-immunotherapy and photo-immunometabolic therapy are first introduced. Then, applications of SPNs for real-time monitoring immunoactivation are discussed. Finally, the conclusion and future perspectives of this research field are given."

Their versatile applications include lymph node mapping, brain vasculature visualization, tumor boundary delineation, and real-time monitoring of reactive oxygen species in tumors. (16 sources)",
                "text": "\nSemiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in deep-tissue tumor detection applications, overcoming many limitations of traditional imaging agents. One of the most significant applications is photoacoustic (PA) imaging, where SPNs generate stronger signals than commonly used single-walled carbon nanotubes and gold nanorods on a per mass basis. This enhanced signal generation allows for whole-body lymph node mapping in living mice with minimal injection doses, demonstrating their efficiency in detecting metastatic spread. <Paper corpusId=\"1454807\" paperTitle=\"(Qian et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"4107691\" paperTitle=\"(Pu et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"27676929\" paperTitle=\"(Luk et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nThe application of SPNs in NIR-II window imaging (1000-1700 nm) represents a significant advancement for deep-tissue tumor detection. Studies have shown that NIR-II PA imaging using SPNs provides approximately 1.5-fold increased signal-to-noise ratio compared to NIR-I excitation, enabling deeper tissue penetration and better contrast in tumor visualization. <Paper corpusId=\"181896308\" paperTitle=\"(Ge et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper> This superior imaging depth and contrast have been particularly valuable for brain tumor detection, where SPNs with donor-acceptor systems have demonstrated enhanced PA effects and stability, resulting in nanoparticles that can cross the blood-brain barrier and provide clear PA signals with low toxicity. <Paper corpusId=\"276809915\" paperTitle=\"(Rizwan et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nMolecular engineering approaches have further enhanced SPN applications in tumor detection. For instance, fullerene-doped SPNs (SPN-F) amplify PA signals through intraparticle photoinduced electron transfer, enhancing nonradiative heat generation upon light irradiation. In vivo studies demonstrated that mice injected with SPN-F20 exhibited significantly higher PA signals in tumors compared to control groups, illustrating the potential for improved tumor visualization. <Paper corpusId=\"16042807\" paperTitle=\"(Wang et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"206700172\" paperTitle=\"(Lyu et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nSPNs have also been successfully employed as reactive oxygen species (ROS) imaging agents, which is particularly valuable for studying various tumor-related pathological processes. Their structural flexibility and narrow PA spectral profiles enable the development of ratiometric PA probes for in vivo real-time imaging of ROS in tumors, strokes, tumor metastasis, bacterial infections, and cardiomyopathy. <Paper corpusId=\"17310914\" paperTitle=\"(Zou et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper> This capability provides crucial information about tumor microenvironments and potential treatment responses.\n\nThe versatility of SPNs extends to multimodal imaging approaches. For example, SPNs can be designed with multilayered nanostructures consisting of core SPs, middle silica layers, and outer PEG coronas for enhanced in vivo NIR fluorescence molecular imaging. These multilayered architectures not only enable lymph node tracking but also facilitate sensitive tumor imaging. <Paper corpusId=\"199056735\" paperTitle=\"(He et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper> Additionally, SPNs can be functionalized with targeting peptides, such as PT peptide, which facilitates active internalization into specific cancer cells like osteosarcoma, permitting accurate early diagnosis through NIR-II fluorescence and PA signals. <Paper corpusId=\"246066001\" paperTitle=\"(Yuan et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nA particularly innovative application of SPNs is in afterglow luminescence imaging for tumor detection. Phenylenevinylene-containing SPNs can store photon energy via chemical defects and emit NIR afterglow luminescence with a half-life of approximately 6-7 minutes. This approach avoids tissue autofluorescence, resulting in remarkably high signal-to-background ratios for detecting tumors through thick tissue. <Paper corpusId=\"253276007\" paperTitle=\"(Wu et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nRecent developments have further expanded SPN applications to include activatable therapeutic and monitoring systems. For instance, SPNs combined with ultrathin manganese oxide nanosheets can generate singlet oxygen by exploiting the elevated acidity in tumors as a trigger. The produced singlet oxygen can excite thiophene-based SPNs to emit photons for near-infrared chemiluminescent imaging, amplifying the generation of singlet oxygen and enabling both tumor detection and treatment. <Paper corpusId=\"221589724\" paperTitle=\"(2020)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nAdvanced SPN-based platforms have also been developed for ultrasound-activated cancer treatment in deep-tissue tumors. These systems utilize SPNs as sonosensitizers to generate singlet oxygen upon ultrasound irradiation, while incorporating other components like ferroptosis inducers to produce hydroxyl radicals. This dual-ROS generating process enables precise regulation of therapeutic agent release within tumors, increasing antitumor efficacy in deep-tissue tumors that are challenging to treat with conventional methods. <Paper corpusId=\"271112887\" paperTitle=\"(Yim et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nIn summary, SPNs have transformed deep-tissue tumor detection through their exceptional performance in various imaging modalities, including photoacoustic imaging, NIR-II window imaging, afterglow luminescence imaging, and multimodal approaches. Their applications span from lymph node mapping and brain tumor visualization to real-time monitoring of tumor microenvironments and targeted theranostic platforms. <Paper corpusId=\"221660902\" paperTitle=\"(Xie et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"264671713\" paperTitle=\"(Aboeleneen et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"247160239\" paperTitle=\"(Fan et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>",

                            "Photoacoustic (PA) imaging holds great promise for the visualization of physiology and pathology at the molecular level with deep tissue penetration and fine spatial resolution. To fully utilize this potential, PA molecular imaging probes have to be developed. Herein we introduce near infrared (NIR) light absorbing semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) as a new class of contrast agents for PA molecular imaging. SPNs can produce stronger signal than commonly used single-wall carbon nanotubes and gold nanorods on a per mass basis, permitting whole-body lymph node PA mapping in living mice at a low systematic injection mass. Furthermore, SPNs possess high structural flexibility, narrow PA spectral profiles, and strong resistance to photodegradation and oxidation, which enables development of the first NIR ratiometric PA probe for in vivo real-time imaging of reactive oxygen species\u2014vital chemical mediators of many diseases. These results demonstrate SPNs an ideal nanoplatform for developing PA molecular probes."

                            "Semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) have proven to be highly effective contrast agents for PA imaging, particularly in brain tumor imaging. Their unique properties, such as efficient photothermal conversion, excellent photostability, and strong NIR absorption, make them ideal for deep brain imaging. Different donoracceptor systems have been explored to enhance their PA affects and stability, resulting in nanoparticles that can cross the BBB and provide clear PA signals with low toxicity. The copolymer NPs (pentathiophene donors and benzobisthiadiazole acceptors), Dithieno pyrrole copolymers, and Metabolizable NIR-II PA contrast agents encapsulated with PLGA-PEG showed effective brain vasculature imaging and signal persistence. Among them, PDI NPs stood out for their strong NIR absorption and efficient photothermal conversion. With donor-acceptor feature, these PDI NPs provide robust PA signals, especially when modified with DSPE-mPEG5000. PDI have demonstrated significant PA signal enhancement under 700 nm laser irradiation with orthotopic glioblastoma."

                            "Pu et al. developed a fullerene doped semiconducting polymer nanoparticle (SPN-F) that can amplify the PA signal through the intraparticle photoinduced electron transfer (Lyu et al., 2016). As shown in Figure 13A, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) are -3.5 and -4.9 eV for semiconducting polymer and -4.3 and -6.5 eV for fullerene, respectively. Therefore, the semiconducting polymer and fullerene play their roles as electron donor and acceptor, respectively, leading to quenched fluorescence and enhanced nonradiative heat generation upon light irradiation, ultimately achieve amplified PAI signal. As shown in Figure 13B and C, with increasing amount of fullerene doped (SPN-Fx, x: the weight percentages of fullerene), the PA intensity obviously increased. The amplified PA signals of SPNs have also been demonstrated in vivo. As shown in Figure 13D and E, compared to SPN-F0 injected mice, the mice injected with SPN-F20 exhibited much higher PA signals in the tumor at all the time points."

                            "Optical theranostic nanoagents that seamlessly and synergistically integrate light-generated signals with photothermal or photodynamic therapy can provide opportunities for cost-effective precision medicine, while the potential for clinical translation requires them to have good biocompatibility and high imaging/therapy performance. We herein report an intraparticle molecular orbital engineering approach to simultaneously enhance photoacoustic brightness and photothermal therapy efficacy of semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) for in vivo imaging and treatment of cancer. The theranostic SPNs have a binary optical component nanostructure, wherein a near-infrared absorbing semiconducting polymer and an ultrasmall carbon dot (fullerene) interact with each other to induce photoinduced electron transfer upon light irradiation. Such an intraparticle optoelectronic interaction augments heat generation and consequently enhances the photoacoustic signal and maximum photothermal temperature of SPNs by 2.6- and 1.3-fold, respectively. With the use of the amplified SPN as the theranostic nanoagent, it permits enhanced photoacoustic imaging and photothermal ablation of tumor in living mice. Our study thus not only introduces a category of purely organic optical theranostics but also highlights a molecular guideline to amplify the effectiveness of light-intensive imaging and therapeutic nanosystems."

(Yu et al., 2012) Therefore, with a good control of surface chemistry and versatile modifications of functional groups, enormous SPNs have emerged as contrast agents for cell labeling and PAI. (Mallidi et al., 2011) SPNs can be further developed into NIR ratiometric nanoprobes for in vivo imaging of reaction oxygen species (ROS). Considering that ROS acts as a specific biomarker in many pathological processes, SPNs-based nanomaterials are promisingly utilized in the study of strokes, tumor metastasis, bacterial infections and cardiomyopathy."

[195] SPN FeP was synthesized through a self-assemble nanoprecipitation process by integrating a sonodynamic semiconducting polymer, a ferroptosis inducer (ferrocene), a ROScleavable amphiphilic polymer, and a nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase (NAMPT) PROTAC. Upon ultrasound irradiation to the tumor, the semiconducting polymer works as a sonosensitizer to generate singlet oxygen (1O2), while the ferroptosis inducer reacts with intratumoral hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to produce hydroxyl radicals (*OH). This dual-ROS generating programmable process cleaves the ROS-cleavable polymer and induces the release of NAMPT PROTAC within the tumor",

To fully utilize this potential, PA molecular imaging probes have to be developed.

SPNs can produce stronger signal than commonly used single-wall carbon nanotubes and gold nanorods on a per mass basis, permitting whole-body lymph node PA mapping in living mice at a low systematic injection mass. Furthermore, SPNs possess high structural flexibility, narrow PA spectral profiles, and strong resistance to photodegradation and oxidation, which enables development of the first NIR ratiometric PA probe for in vivo real-time imaging of reactive oxygen species\u2014vital chemical mediators of many diseases. These results demonstrate SPNs an ideal nanoplatform for developing PA molecular probes."

                            "Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is a noninvasive hybrid imaging modality offering rich optical contrast and high depth-to-resolution ratio deep-tissue imaging. Endogenous chromophores present in the body such as hemoglobin, lipid, melanin, and so on provide strong photoacoustic contrast due to their strong light absorption in certain optical window. To enhance the performance of PAI further, researchers have developed several exogenous contrast agents such as metallic nanoparticles, carbon-based nanomaterials, quantum dots, organic small molecules, semiconducting polymer nanoparticles, and so on. These exogenous contrast agents not only help improving the imaging contrast, but also make targeted molecular imaging possible. In this review article, we first discuss the state-of-the-art PAI techniques with endogenous contrast mechanism. Later, we provide an overview of recent progress in the development of exogenous photoacoustic contrast agents for in vivo imaging applications. Finally, we present the pros/cons of the existing PA contrast agents along with future challenges of contrast agent-based PAI for biomedical applications.

                            "Photoacoustic (PA) imaging in the second near\u2010infrared (NIR\u2010II) window (1000\u20131700 nm) holds great promise for deep\u2010tissue diagnosis due to the reduced light scattering and minimized tissue absorption; however, exploration of such a noninvasive imaging technique is greatly constrained by the lack of biodegradable NIR\u2010II absorbing agents. Herein, the first series of metabolizable NIR\u2010II PA agents are reported based on semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs). Such completely organic nanoagents consist of \u03c0\u2010conjugated yet oxidizable optical polymer as PA generator and hydrolyzable amphiphilic polymer as particle matrix to provide water solubility. The obtained SPNs are readily degraded by myeloperoxidase and lipase abundant in phagocytes, transforming from nonfluorescent nanoparticles (30 nm) into NIR fluorescent ultrasmall metabolites (\u22481 nm). As such, these nanoagents can be effectively cleared out via both hepatobiliary and renal excretions after systematic administration, leaving no toxicity to living mice. Particularly these nanoagents possess high photothermal conversion efficiencies and emit bright PA signals at 1064 nm, enabling sensitive NIR\u2010II PA imaging of both subcutaneous tumor and deep brain vasculature through intact skull in living animals at a low systematic dosage. This study thus provides a generalized molecular design toward organic metabolizable semiconducting materials for biophotonic applications in NIR\u2010II window."

                            "In the past few years, conjugated polymer nanoparticles (CPNs) have been successfully prepared and applied in the biological field because of their unique opto-electronic properties. The rapid development of CPNs is mainly attributed to their simple synthesis procedures and easy separation steps. The advantages of CPNs include high brightness, excellent photostability, low cytotoxicity, high quantum yield and versatile surface modification. The functionalization of CPNs with specific recognition elements imparts them good ability for targeted recognition and imaging in vitro and in vivo. CPNs can be applied to deliver drug and gene, and simultaneously to real-time monitor the release process due to their self-luminous characteristics. Moreover, CPNs can sensitize oxygen molecules to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) which can kill adjacent bacteria and tumor cells. In this tutorial review, we provide a recent development of the preparation methods, properties, and functionalization strategies of CPNs, especially discussing their biological applications in targeted imaging, drug/gene delivery and biomedicine. The challenges and outlooks in this field will also be discussed."

                            "Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is an atomic targeted radiotherapy that shows fantastic suppression impact on locally intrusive threatening tumors. One key factor for effective BNCT is to aggregate an adequate concentration (>20 ppm) of 10B in the cytoplasm of the tumor. Carborane-loaded polymer nanoparticles are promising because of their outstanding biocompatibility and plasma steadiness. In this study, a new class of carborane-loaded nanoscale covalent organic polymers (BCOPs) was prepared by a Schiff base condensation reaction, and their solubility was greatly improved in common solvents via alkyl chain engineering and size tailoring. The obtained BCOP-5T was further functionalized by biocompatible 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[amino(polyethylene-glycol)-2000] (DSPE-PEG, molecular weight 2000) to form stable aqueous-phase nanoparticles with a hydrodynamic diameter of around 100 nm. After chelating with radioactive copper-64, DSPE-BCOP-5T was tracked by positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and showed significant accumulation in the tumor. DSPE-BCOP-5T + neutron radiation showed remarkable tumor suppression in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice (murine breast cancer). No obvious physical tissue damage and abnormal behavior were observed, demonstrating that the boron delivery was successful and tumor-selective. To conclude, this study presents a theranostic COP-based platform with a well-defined composition, good biocompatibility, and satisfactory tumor accumulation, which is promising for PET imaging, drug delivery, and BNCT."

                            "Phototheranostics represents a promising direction for modern precision medicine, which has recently attracted great research interest from multidisciplinary research areas. Organic optical agents including small molecular fluorophores, semiconducting/conjugated polymers, aggregation-induced emission luminogens, etc. with tuneable photophysical properties, high biosafety and biocompatibility, facile processability and ease of functionalization have delivered encouraging performance in disease phototheranostics. This review summarizes the recent progress of organic phototheranostic agents with an emphasis on the main strategies to manipulate the three excitation energy dissipation pathways, namely, radiative decay, thermal deactivation, and intersystem crossing, with the assistance of a Jablonski diagram, which particularly showcases how the Jablonski diagram has been guiding the design of organic agents from molecule to aggregate levels to promote the disease phototheranostic outcomes. Molecular design and nanoengineering strategies to modulate photophysical processes of organic optical agents to convert the absorbed photons into fluorescent/phosphorescent/photoacoustic signals and/or photodynamic/photothermal curing effects for improved disease phototheranostics are elaborated. Noteworthily, adaptive phototheranostics with activatable and transformable functions on demand, and regulation of excitation such as chemiexcitation to promote the phototheranostic efficacies are also included. A brief summary with the discussion of current challenges and future perspectives in this research field is further presented."

                            "PAI can overcome the traditional optical penetration limitations (e.g., fluorescence imaging) since it detects phonons rather than photons under light excitation, providing superior spatial resolution, high contrast, and deep tissue penetration [7,[9][10][11]. To date, various optical agents have been developed for PAI/PTT theranostics, including small molecule dyes, metallic nanoparticles, and carbon nanomaterials [12][13][14][15][16]. Nevertheless, small molecule dyes usually suffer from photobleaching, while metallic nanoparticles encounter severe biotoxicity and carbon nanomaterials have broad PAI spectra without a specific wavelength and a low extinction coefficient for PAI and PTT [17,18]. Semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) characterized by \u03c0-\u03c0 electron delocalized backbones and easy exciton diffusion along the backbone represent a new PAI/PTT agent with good photostability, high extinction coefficient, and excellent photothermal conversion efficiency [1,5]. As SPNs are fabricated from biologically inert organic compounds, they can inherently avoid of heavy metal ion-induced toxicity to tissues and thus possess good biocompatibility [19]."

                            "Photoacoustic (PA) imaging and photothermal therapy (PTT) have attracted extensive attention in disease diagnosis and treatment. Although many exogenous contrast agents have been developed for PA imaging and PTT, the design guidelines to amplify their imaging and therapy performances remain challenging and are highly demanded. Semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) composed of polymers with \u03c0-electron delocalized backbones can be designed to amplify their PA imaging and PTT performance, because of their clear structure-property relation and versatility in modifying their molecular structures to tune their photophysical properties. This review summarizes the recent advances in the photoacoustic imaging and photothermal therapy applications of semiconducting polymer nanoparticles with a focus on signal amplification and second near-infrared (NIR-II, 1000-1700\u00a0nm) construction. The strategies such as structure-property screening, fluorescence quenching, accelerated heat dissipation, and size-dependent heat dissipation are first discussed to amplify the PA brightness of SPNs for in vivo PA. The molecular approaches to shifting the absorption of SPNs for NIR-II PA imaging and PTT are then introduced so as to improve the tissue penetration depth for diagnosis and therapy. At last, current challenges and perspectives of SPNs in the field of imaging and therapy are discussed."

                            "Immunotherapy that stimulates the body's own immune system to kill cancer cells has emerged as a promising cancer therapeutic method. However, some types of cancer exhibited a low response rate to immunotherapy, and the high risk of immune-related side effects has been aroused during immunotherapy, which greatly restrict its broad applications in cancer therapy. Phototherapy that uses external light to trigger the therapeutic process holds advantages including high selectivity and efficiency, and low side effects. Recently, it has been proven to be able to stimulate immune response in the tumor region by inducing immunogenic cell death (ICD), the process of which was termed photo-immunotherapy, dramatically improving therapeutic specificity over conventional immunotherapy in several aspects. Among numerous optical materials for photo-immunotherapy, semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) have gained more and more attention owing to their excellent optical properties and good biocompatibility. In this review, we summarize recent developments of SPNs for immunotherapy and imaging of immunoactivation. Different therapeutic modalities triggered by SPNs including photo-immunotherapy and photo-immunometabolic therapy are first introduced. Then, applications of SPNs for real-time monitoring immunoactivation are discussed. Finally, the conclusion and future perspectives of this research field are given."
