In this review, we focus on the use of phage libraries, which display antibody fragments, for generating recombinant antibodies to membrane proteins. Such affinity reagents generally have high specificity and affinity for their targets. They have been used for cell staining, for promoting protein crystallization to solve three-dimensional structures, for diagnostics, and for treating diseases as therapeutics. We cover publications on this topic from the past 10 years, with a focus on the various formats of membrane proteins for affinity selection and the diverse affinity selection strategies used. Lastly, we discuss the challenges faced in this field and provide possible directions for future efforts.\n## Various Applications of Recombinant Antibodies\nAs of 2016, there are seven phage-display derived drugs that have been approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the USA. The approved list includes the global best-selling drug, Adalimumab (also known as Humira), a recombinant antibody used to treating autoimmune diseases [135].

These antibodies are mainly derived from two types of sources: immune, or na\u00efve libraries. Immune libraries should be preferred when immunized animals or convalescent patients are available, offering the chance to directly isolate affinity matured antibodies. If immunization is not possible or ethically not feasible, na\u00efve antibody gene libraries are an alternative. In such an approach, the antibody generation process is not limited by the immune system.

Kuhn, Viola F\u00fchner, Tobias Unkauf, G. Moreira, A. Frenzel, Sebastian Miethe, M. Hust\n## Abstract\nAntibodies are valuable molecules for the diagnostic and treatment of diseases caused by pathogens and toxins. Traditionally, these antibodies are generated by hybridoma technology. An alternative to hybridoma technology is the use of antibody phage display to generate recombinant antibodies. This in vitro technology circumvents the limitations of the immune system and allows\u2014in theory\u2014the generation of antibodies against all conceivable molecules. Phage display technology enables obtaining human antibodies from na\u00efve antibody gene libraries when either patients are not available or immunization is not ethically feasible. On the other hand, if patients or immunized/infected animals are available, it is common to construct immune phage display libraries to select in vivo affinity\u2010matured antibodies. Because the phage packaged DNA sequence encoding the antibodies is directly available, the antibodies can be smoothly engineered according to the requirements of the final application. In this review, an overview of phage display derived recombinant antibodies against bacterial, viral, and eukaryotic pathogens as well as toxins for diagnostics and therapy is given.\n## Conclusion\nAntibody phage display allows the generation of recombinant antibodies from different species, including human, llama, camel, macaque, shark, or mice. These antibodies are mainly derived from two types of sources: immune, or na\u00efve libraries. Immune libraries should be preferred when immunized animals or convalescent patients are available, offering the chance to directly isolate affinity matured antibodies. If immunization is not possible or ethically not feasible, na\u00efve antibody gene libraries are an alternative. In such an approach, the antibody generation process is not limited by the immune system. Using antibody phage display a variety of recombinant antibodies was generated for diagnostics and therapy against bacterial, viral pathogens, and eukaryotic pathogens as well as toxins. \n\nWe acknowledge funding from the European Community's Seventh Framework Program (FP7/2007-2013) under agreement no. 241832 granted to the AntiBotABE project (http://www.antibotabe.com), funding from Federal State of Lower Saxony, Nieders\u00e4chsisches Vorab (VWZN2889), and APTDETECT (Eurostars).

Initially, its development was encouraged by the unique possibility of directly generating recombinant human antibodies for therapy. Today, antibody phage display has been developed as a robust technology offering great potential for automation. Generation of monospecific binders provides a valuable tool for proteome research, leading to highly enhanced throughput and reduced costs. This review presents the phage display technology, application areas of antibodies in research, diagnostics and therapy and the use of antibody phage display for these applications.",

Schirrmann, Torsten Meyer, Mark Sch\u00fctte, A. Frenzel, M. Hust\n## Abstract\nTwenty years after its development, antibody phage display using filamentous bacteriophage represents the most successful in vitro antibody selection technology. Initially, its development was encouraged by the unique possibility of directly generating recombinant human antibodies for therapy. Today, antibody phage display has been developed as a robust technology offering great potential for automation. Generation of monospecific binders provides a valuable tool for proteome research, leading to highly enhanced throughput and reduced costs. This review presents the phage display technology, application areas of antibodies in research, diagnostics and therapy and the use of antibody phage display for these applications.\n## Antibodies for Diagnostics\nThere are three general ways to use antibodies for diagnostics.The first way is the detection of antigens using antibodies [77] and the second, but reversed way is the detection of serum antibodies using antigens [78].The third way is the competition assay, here, e.g., antigens are detected by serum antibodies which compete with a defined antibody preparation [79].The advantage of an antibody competition assay is its species independence [80].Other prominent technologies used for diagnostics are lateral flow strip assays [81,82], bead based assays such as Luminex [83], flow cytometry [58,84], the hemagglutination assay [85], and more recently, the proximity ligation assay [86] or molecular imaging [87].An interesting diagnostic method is the direct use of phage particles fused to antibodies [88] for diagnostics.Sensitivity of the diagnostic assay can be enhanced by detection of the about 2700 copies of pVIII of an antibody phage by secondary antibodies [89,90].Antibody phage particles can also be used for immuno-PCR [91].\n\nTo date, there are many examples for the application of antibodies derived by phage display for diagnostics [92][93][94].A big advantage of antibody phage display for diagnostics is the direct access to the genetic information of the binder, allowing a fast adaption of the antibody format e.g., IgG, scFv-Fc, biotinylated antibody or scFv-phoA fusion [40] to the desired diagnostic assay.\n\nPhage display allows also the identification of immunogenic proteins, e.g., from pathogens [95][96][97].Combining antibody phage display with antigen phage display all steps from identification of antigens to the generation of antibodies against these antigens for diagnostics are available.\n\n## Antibodies for Therapeutical Applications\nThe anti-TNF-alpha antibody adalimumab (tradename Humira \u00ae ) was isolated using antibody phage display by guided selection using a murine antibody as template [10,99].Other FDA-approved human antibodies are the anti-EGFR antibody panitumumab (tradename Vectibix \u00ae ) [106] and golimumab (tradename Simponi \u00ae ) [107] directed against TNF-alpha.Further examples are canakinumab (tradename Ilaris \u00ae ), an interleukin-1\u03b2 (Il-1\u03b2)-specific antibody for treatment of cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes [108], and the anti-IL12/23 antibody ustekinumab (tradename Stelara \u00ae ) for treatment of psoriasis [109].These human antibodies are derived from transgenic mice expressing the human antibody gene repertoire.\n\nTo date, several therapeutic antibodies derived from phage display are in clinical development [33,98,110,111].Most phage display derived antibodes are generated by CAT (now MedImmune, part of AstraZeneca), Morphosys and Dyax.An example for the generation of human antibodies by phage display and further development is belimumab (tradename Benlysta \u00ae ).This antibody was generated by CAT for treatment of autoimmune diseases, mainly systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).This antibody was selected from the Vaughan library [112] against the B lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS).Afterwards, the initial binders were ranked by the efficiency to block BLyS binding to the BLyS receptor in cell based assays.The best scFvs were converted into the IgG format and neutralisation efficiency of the IgG were analysed again [113].This step is important, because the affinity of some antibodies is decreased after converting from the scFv to the IgG format [113,114].Two lead scFvs were further optimised by randomisation of the CDR3 of the heavy chain and selection on BLyS by phage display.",

The in vivo production of antibodies by B-cells involves a series of intricate gene editing processes resulting in a highly diverse pool of antibodies. However, this diversity can be replicated in vitro using phage display. Phage display offers the potential to present the antibody phenotype together with the cloned genotype of the specific antibody in a single-phage particle. Antibodies are highly sought after for diagnostic applications owing to its specificity and affinity towards a target antigen. The advent of recombinant antibody (rAb) technology allows for a faster and more costeffective solution for antibody generation. It also provides diagnostic developers with the possibility to customize the antibodies. Antibodies have been utilized successfully in various diagnostic platforms ranging from standard immunoassays to lateral-flow assays, nanoparticles, microfluidics, DNA\u2010integrated assays and others. The limitless application of antibodies in the field of diagnostics has made it a critical component in any diagnostic development platform. This chapter focuses on the processes involved in antibody discovery including the various forms of antibody libraries for phage display and panning processes. We also highlight some diagnostic platforms that apply recombinant antibodies.",

The in vivo production of antibodies by B-cells involves a series of intricate gene editing processes resulting in a highly diverse pool of antibodies. However, this diversity can be replicated in vitro using phage display. Phage display offers the potential to present the antibody phenotype together with the cloned genotype of the specific antibody in a single-phage particle. Antibodies are highly sought after for diagnostic applications owing to its specificity and affinity towards a target antigen. The advent of recombinant antibody (rAb) technology allows for a faster and more costeffective solution for antibody generation. It also provides diagnostic developers with the possibility to customize the antibodies. Antibodies have been utilized successfully in various diagnostic platforms ranging from standard immunoassays to lateral-flow assays, nanoparticles, microfluidics, DNA\u2010integrated assays and others. The limitless application of antibodies in the field of diagnostics has made it a critical component in any diagnostic development platform. This chapter focuses on the processes involved in antibody discovery including the various forms of antibody libraries for phage display and panning processes. We also highlight some diagnostic platforms that apply recombinant antibodies.\n## Introduction\ngeneration. This brought about various methods including phage display and other multiple display methods such as yeast display, ribosome display and mammalian cell display methods [14]. In addition, the use of transgenic animals was also introduced mainly with the xeno-mouse technology [11,13,14]. Even so, phage display is the preferred choice for recombinant antibody (rAb) production in most laboratories. Phage display allows for a faster and cost-effective solution towards antibody generation using Ff filamentous phage. In general, rAb production involves several steps including the generation of an antibody library, selection and enrichment of phage-displaying antibodies against specific antigens through the panning process, screening of monospecific antibodies and recombinant production of the antibodies via expression systems [15]. As phage-derived rAb may suffer from lower affinities, an additional stage of affinity maturation may be introduced to improve the antibodies produced. A major advantage to the use of phage display for rAb generation in contrast to conventional animal-derived methods is clearly the omission of animal use in the process. Another advantage of phage display is the lower downtime required for antibody production in between antigens. Conventional methods require immunization that may take up to weeks if not months to yield sufficient immune response for antibody production. This makes phage display rather efficient in the long term for antibody production process. However, one must acknowledge that phage-derived antibodies suffer from lower affinity when compared to conventional antibodies. This is due to the absence of affinity maturation in phage-derived antibodies as animal-derived antibodies are produced post maturation.\n\nThis chapter highlights monoclonal antibody development for diagnostic applications via phage display technology. This includes the different types of antibody libraries associated with antibody phage display. The chapter also highlights the different methods used to isolate antibodies against target antigens. The application of recombinant antibodies in different diagnostic platforms is also discussed briefly.\n\n## Conclusion\nPhage display technology is commonly used for recombinant antibody production. The ability to produce antibodies via recombinant methods can help to improve the speed at which newer antibodies are produced at a fraction of the conventional cost. The freedom associated with recombinant antibodies would also allow the customization of antibodies for various downstream applications in diagnostics. This is particularly important as the development of newer technologies in sensing and reporting mechanisms, the flexibility of recombinant antibodies towards modifications would allow the antibodies to evolve with the advancement of sensing technologies. Therefore, phage display-derived recombinant antibodies provide an important platform for antibody generation for current and future diagnostic applications.",

                    "text": "Up to date, a vast plethora of antibodies for diagnostic applications has been generated via phage-display against different bacterial proteins or carbohydrates (Table 1). Interestingly, research on this field seems to be in constant rise, as 44% of these antibodies have been generated only in the past five years. \n\nIn the following paragraphs, we offer detailed examples on antibodies against different bacterial pathogens that were generated using phage display. \n\nMycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is the bacteria responsible for a lung infection known as Tuberculosis (TB). This pathogen specifically attacks and replicates inside the macrophage cells in the alveoli, causing fatigue, fever and coughing (Fu and Fu-Liu, 2002). As of 2021, this disease affected approximately 10 million people and caused 1.5 million deaths worldwide per year (World Health Organization, 2021). TB early diagnosis is essential to improve treatment and limit disease spread. The protein secreted by Mtb in the highest amounts, Antigen 85 (Ag85), represents an ideal target for diagnostics (Wiker and Harboe, 1992). Ag85 is an oligomeric protein composed of three relatively small (30-32 kDa) homologue proteins (Ag85A, Ag85B and Ag85C) (Wiker et al., 1992). In a novel approach described by Ferrara et al. (2012), a combination of antibody display techniques was successfully adopted to select Ag85 complex-specific antibodies. A universal phage display na\u00efve scFv-library with a nominal diversity of ~10 11 unique antibodies was used for initial selection on Ag85, obtaining a sub-library of 10 5 pre-selected antibodies. Second, the selected antigen-specific scFv genes were used for the generation of yeast-display antibody sub-library. Upon completion of yeast based antibody generation, each clone was tested in FACS for its ability to specifically recognize the antigen target resulting in the discovery of 192 clones having the desired properties. Sequence analysis revealed that 111 of these antibodies were unique and could be used in further Ab characterization. Chessboard antibody combination testing resulted in the identification of 7 antibody pairs that detect as little as 22.7 nM Ag85 in patient sera or 6.1 nM in serum freeconditions.",

Gene and colleagues (Gene et al., 2015) used naive and immune camelid antibody libraries for the selection via phage display of diagnostic nanobodies against internalin B (InIB), a protein which is strongly involved in host-cell invasion. Two of the five generated nanobodies, R3-03 and R3-30, showed picomolar binding affinities to InIB, representing a valuable resource for bacteria immunodetection in poorly concentrated samples. A recent study from Moreira et al. (2020) described the use in combination of different phage display techniques to identify new Listeria spp. protein biomarkers and rise antibodies against them. Initially, the human na\u00efve antibody display phage library HAL9/10 was used to generate antibodies against different cell fractions from L. monocytogenes (cell wall, membrane, and cytoplasm). This way, four binders were isolated, which allowed the identification of a novel target for Listeria spp. detection named pyruvate dehydrogenase complex-enzyme 2 (PDC-E2) by using both immunomagnetic separation/mass spectrometry (IMS-MS) and ORFeome phage display. One of these antibodies was also used in immunofluorescence on non-permeabilized cells confirming the surface localization of the target. Antibody selection against PDC-E2 recombinant antigen yielded 16 additional antibodies. These 20 antibodies were finally tested in indirect ELISA against a panel of 17 Listeria species (including the most virulent L. monocytogenes serotypes 4b, 1/2a, and 1/2b) and 16 non-Listeria species. Two antibodies, GSM313-E9 and GSM313-H8, provided 100% sensitivity and specificity for Listeria spp. detection. Moreover, the binding region (epitope) of 18 out of the 20 antibodies was identified via single-gene phage display for epitope mapping, enabling to define the lipoyl domains of PDC-E2 as the major contributors for the detection through this target.",

Antibodies were integrated in our medical repertoire against infectious diseases more than hundred years ago by using animal sera to treat tetanus and diphtheria. In these days, most developed therapeutic antibodies target cancer or autoimmune diseases. The COVID-19 pandemic was a reminder about the importance of antibodies for therapy against infectious diseases. While monoclonal antibodies could be generated by hybridoma technology since the 70ies of the former century, nowadays antibody phage display, among other display technologies, is robustly established to discover new human monoclonal antibodies. Phage display is an in vitro technology which confers the potential for generating antibodies from universal libraries against any conceivable molecule of sufficient size and omits the limitations of the immune systems. If convalescent patients or immunized/infected animals are available, it is possible to construct immune phage display libraries to select in vivo affinity-matured antibodies. A further advantage is the availability of the DNA sequence encoding the phage displayed antibody fragment, which is packaged in the phage particles. Therefore, the selected antibody fragments can be rapidly further engineered in any needed antibody format according to the requirements of the final application. In this review, we present an overview of phage display derived recombinant antibodies against bacterial, viral and eukaryotic pathogens, as well as microbial toxins, intended for diagnostic and therapeutic applications.\n## RECOMBINANT ANTIBODIES AGAINST BACTERIA\nUp to date, a vast plethora of antibodies for diagnostic applications has been generated via phage-display against different bacterial proteins or carbohydrates (Table 1). Interestingly, research on this field seems to be in constant rise, as 44% of these antibodies have been generated only in the past five years. \n\nIn the following paragraphs, we offer detailed examples on antibodies against different bacterial pathogens that were generated using phage display. \n\nMycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is the bacteria responsible for a lung infection known as Tuberculosis (TB). This pathogen specifically attacks and replicates inside the macrophage cells in the alveoli, causing fatigue, fever and coughing (Fu and Fu-Liu, 2002). As of 2021, this disease affected approximately 10 million people and caused 1.5 million deaths worldwide per year (World Health Organization, 2021). TB early diagnosis is essential to improve treatment and limit disease spread. The protein secreted by Mtb in the highest amounts, Antigen 85 (Ag85), represents an ideal target for diagnostics (Wiker and Harboe, 1992). Ag85 is an oligomeric protein composed of three relatively small (30-32 kDa) homologue proteins (Ag85A, Ag85B and Ag85C) (Wiker et al., 1992). In a novel approach described by Ferrara et al. (2012), a combination of antibody display techniques was successfully adopted to select Ag85 complex-specific antibodies. A universal phage display na\u00efve scFv-library with a nominal diversity of ~10 11 unique antibodies was used for initial selection on Ag85, obtaining a sub-library of 10 5 pre-selected antibodies. Second, the selected antigen-specific scFv genes were used for the generation of yeast-display antibody sub-library. Upon completion of yeast based antibody generation, each clone was tested in FACS for its ability to specifically recognize the antigen target resulting in the discovery of 192 clones having the desired properties. Sequence analysis revealed that 111 of these antibodies were unique and could be used in further Ab characterization. Chessboard antibody combination testing resulted in the identification of 7 antibody pairs that detect as little as 22.7 nM Ag85 in patient sera or 6.1 nM in serum freeconditions.\n...\ndetection. Gene and colleagues (Gene et al., 2015) used naive and immune camelid antibody libraries for the selection via phage display of diagnostic nanobodies against internalin B (InIB), a protein which is strongly involved in host-cell invasion. Two of the five generated nanobodies, R3-03 and R3-30, showed picomolar binding affinities to InIB, representing a valuable resource for bacteria immunodetection in poorly concentrated samples. A recent study from Moreira et al. (2020) described the use in combination of different phage display techniques to identify new Listeria spp. protein biomarkers and rise antibodies against them.

                    "text": "The journey of generating antibodies through phage display technology commences with the construction of a diverse library. This process entails integrating genetic material encoding antibody fragments, such as antibodies' heavy and light chains, single-chain variable fragments (scFvs), Fabs, or peptides, into the genome of bacteriophages, notably filamentous ones like M13 [10]. This fusion results in the expression of a multitude of unique antibody candidates on the surface of phages, forming the basis of the library. The diversity of this library, ranging from millions to billions of variants, lays the groundwork for the subsequent exploration of potential binding partners (Figure 1) [11]. \n\nfoundation for the subsequent refinement and enhancement of phage display technology. The significant contributions of George P. Smith and Greg Winter culminated in the recognition of a half share of the 2018 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their seminal work in developing phage display. \n\nUp to now, the impact of phage display in generating antibodies extends across diverse applications. In the field of therapeutics, it has played a pivotal role in the development of monoclonal antibodies for various diseases, including cancer, autoimmune disorders, infectious diseases, and neurological conditions. Furthermore, phage display has significantly contributed to the discovery of antibodies targeting specific viral pathogens, such as influenza and HIV, providing valuable tools for both diagnosis and treatment [7,8]. Beyond therapeutics, phage display has been instrumental in antibody engineering, epitope mapping, and the study of protein interactions. Additionally, it has facilitated the identification of novel peptide ligands for drug targeting, the development of biosensors for disease detection, and the creation of protein libraries for enzyme optimization and protein-protein interaction studies [9]. Overall, phage display continues to revolutionize biotechnology and biomedical research by enabling the rapid and efficient generation of high-affinity antibodies and protein-based therapeutics for a wide range of applications.",

Additionally, phage display offers greater versatility in antibody engineering, allowing for the incorporation of specific modifications, such as humanization or affinity maturation, to improve therapeutic efficacy and reduce immunogenicity. Moreover, phage display-derived antibodies offer potential benefits in terms of manufacturing scalability and cost effectiveness. Unlike traditional mAbs produced from hybridoma cell lines, phage-derived antibodies can be generated entirely in vitro, eliminating the need for animal immunization and cell culture-based production systems. This streamlined production process enables rapid and cost-effective antibody development, making phage display an attractive platform for the generation of therapeutic antibodies [22].",

                    "text": "For instance, Abicipar pegol, an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibody fragment, has been approved for the treatment of neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration. Belimumab (Benlysta), targeting the soluble B lymphocyte stimulator, which is involved in the survival and activation of B cells, is employed to reduce disease activity in systemic lupus erythematosus patients [37]. \n\nThe process of constructing these engineered antibodies follows a similar procedure. Initially, a phage library is generated by cloning a diverse array of antibody variable region sequences into a phage display vector. This library encompasses a broad spectrum of antibody fragments, each showcased on the surface of individual phage particles. Through multiple rounds of biopanning, phages displaying antibodies that specifically bind to the target antigen are selected from the library. These chosen phages are subsequently amplified and propagated to enrich for high-affinity binders. Finally, the DNA sequences encoding the variable regions of the selected antibodies are isolated and inserted into expression vectors for the production of full-length antibodies. Atezolizumab, for instance, was discovered through screening a human phage display library against a recombinant extracellular domain-Fc fusion of human PD-L1. From this screening, a high-affinity antibody was isolated from a single phage clone, utilizing a human IgG1 backbone. Due to PD-L1 expression on activated T cells, the Fc region of atezolizumab underwent engineering to abolish the antibody-dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC) effect. This engineering involved introducing an Asn to Ala substitution at position 298 within the CH2 domain of each heavy chain. As a result, atezolizumab was rendered incapable of binding to human Fc\u03b3 receptors. \n\nComparing the use of a phage-derived monoclonal antibody (mAb) to the original mAb in cancer treatment reveals several advantages of phage display-derived antibodies. Firstly, phage display allows for the generation of antibodies with enhanced specificity and affinity through iterative rounds of selection and optimization. This enables the identification of antibodies with superior binding properties compared to those obtained through traditional hybridoma-based methods [36].",

This integration aims to identify the rare sequences holding potential binding affinity and predict the binding features of sequences obtained during the panning process [87,88]. \n\nThe phage display library finds another compelling application in the development of tumor-targeting peptides, particularly for diagnostic purposes [89,90]. These peptides play a pivotal role in creating imaging agents designed to specifically illuminate cancerous lesions. By associating with nanoparticle conjugation, these peptides not only enhance sensitivity in cancer diagnosis, but also contribute to improved contrast imaging capabilities. An inherent advantage of leveraging phage display libraries for tumor-targeting peptide development lies in the vast and diverse pool of peptide sequences that can be explored. This unique feature enables the discovery of peptides with the capacity to selectively recognize and bind to the distinctive molecular signatures present on the surface of cancer cells [48,91]. While fluorescent antibodies are currently employed in molecular imaging for their exceptional affinity and selectivity, peptides emerge as superior carriers for guiding imaging probes to tumor sites due to their effective tissue penetration-an attribute not easily achievable with antibodies. Despite its recognized potential, the clinical use of tumortargeting peptides has been limited, primarily due to challenges related to immunogenicity, clearance issues, and a lack of a comprehensive understanding of their behavior within the human body. Addressing these hurdles requires ongoing efforts to unlock the full potential of tumor-targeting peptides in the realm of cancer diagnostics, ensuring their effective and safe utilization in clinical settings. \n\nWhile phage display has matured into a well-established platform for antibody development, the commercial utilization of major phage display platforms, as outlined in Table 1, has predominantly been limited to a handful of biopharmaceutical companies holding intellectual property rights. Consequently, a majority of the antibodies developed today are owned by these companies with proprietary access to the underlying technologies.",

                    "text": "Phage libraries derived from rearranged V-gene repertoires are created using mRNA or RNA isolated from B cells obtained from either immunized or na\u00efve donors. The construction process entails initially preparing the cDNA template through reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Subsequently, the repertoire of variable heavy (VH) and variable light (VL) chain genes is amplified via PCR before being cloned into the phagemid vector [22]. While phage display technology has been widely used for novel antibody development, it is noteworthy that there are different types of phage display libraries after many years of development. \n\nAs one of the first libraries constructed, scFv libraries are commonly used for antibody selection. They consist of antibody fragments that include the VH and VL chains linked by a flexible peptide linker. This format allows the expression of functional antigen-binding sites in a single polypeptide chain. For instance, the Tomlinson I and J libraries are wellknown scFv libraries derived from human germline sequences. They offer a diverse source of antibody fragments for various applications. Another well-known application is the selection of scFv antibodies against specific tumor antigens using phage display, as demonstrated by Lee et al. [23]. In contrast, Fab libraries display antibody fragments that consist of the variable regions of both the heavy and light chains, along with the constant regions of the heavy chain. Fabs maintain the antigen-binding capacity of antibodies while providing additional structural stability. The HuCAL (Human Combinatorial Antibody Library) Fab library is a widely used human-derived library for the generation of Fab fragments with therapeutic potential [24]. In addition, a study by Gram et al. utilized a Fab phage display library to isolate antibodies specific to the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) [25]. \n\nIn addition to the libraries from human and mice, single-domain antibody (nanobody) libraries have been derived from the variable domains of the heavy-chain-only antibodies found in camelids, such as llamas and camels. Renowned for their unique structural and functional attributes, nanobodies are single polypeptide chains that retain the antigenbinding capabilities of conventional antibodies [26,27].",

                    "text": "Cancer, a complex and multifaceted group of diseases characterized by uncontrolled cell growth, remains a significant global health challenge. The development of effective cancer treatment drugs is crucial in addressing this pervasive issue [82][83][84]. Among the diverse arsenal of therapeutic approaches, antibodies play a pivotal role due to their precision in targeting specific molecules associated with cancer cells. In the contemporary landscape, phage display stands out as one of the most prevalent and robust systems for the discovery and development of antibodies. Its widespread adoption is attributed to several advantages, such as the manipulable size of the phage's genome, the efficient nature of phage infection, the cost effectiveness and safety associated with phage preparation and propagation, and the ability to perform high-throughput screening for peptides and antibodies. Additionally, the technology allows for rapid screening, contributing to its appeal [85]. Despite these numerous advantages, it is crucial to acknowledge that there are still areas within this technology that demand further enhancement and refinement to meet evolving needs. \n\nAn advantageous aspect of the phage display library, in comparison to other antibody development technologies, lies in its swift and convenient retrieval of peptide sequence information [14]. Typically, the assessment focuses on the most abundant sequences obtained from the panning output. However, a challenge arises when very few specific clones, carrying a small percentage of the sequence information, are acquired. This limitation is a result of the amplification bias of the desirable antibody-displaying phages during the panning cycles, causing certain sequences to become increasingly rare throughout the process. Furthermore, it is essential to acknowledge the potential divergence in conformation between chemically synthesized peptides and their original state on the phage display. The presence of multiple copies of exogenously displayed peptides on the phages can lead to robust binding during the selection process. Therefore, maintaining the authentic conformation of phage-derived peptides during chemical synthesis becomes crucial to ensure that their binding strength remains comparable to the original phages. Additionally, a recurring challenge in this technology is the occurrence of false positives during screening. This issue arises from the non-specific absorption that can preoccupy the phages before positive selection, emphasizing the need for strategies to mitigate false positives and enhance the accuracy of the screening process [86].",

Since then, numerous phage-derived antibodies have been successfully developed and advanced into clinical studies, resulting in the approval of more than a dozen therapeutic antibodies. These antibodies have demonstrated efficacy across a spectrum of medical conditions, ranging from autoimmune diseases to various cancers. In this article, we provide an in-depth review of the development of phage display libraries as powerful platforms for therapeutic antibody discovery, elucidating the intricate procedures involved in antibody development. Additionally, we conduct a review of the current ntibody drugs for cancer treatment that have been developed using the phage display platform. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges inherent in this technology, offering insights into potential solutions to enhance crucial steps and facilitate more efficient drug discovery in the field of phage display technology.\n## Library Construction\nThe journey of generating antibodies through phage display technology commences with the construction of a diverse library. This process entails integrating genetic material encoding antibody fragments, such as antibodies' heavy and light chains, single-chain variable fragments (scFvs), Fabs, or peptides, into the genome of bacteriophages, notably filamentous ones like M13 [10]. This fusion results in the expression of a multitude of unique antibody candidates on the surface of phages, forming the basis of the library. The diversity of this library, ranging from millions to billions of variants, lays the groundwork for the subsequent exploration of potential binding partners (Figure 1) [11]. \n\nfoundation for the subsequent refinement and enhancement of phage display technology. The significant contributions of George P. Smith and Greg Winter culminated in the recognition of a half share of the 2018 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their seminal work in developing phage display. \n\nUp to now, the impact of phage display in generating antibodies extends across diverse applications. In the field of therapeutics, it has played a pivotal role in the development of monoclonal antibodies for various diseases, including cancer, autoimmune disorders, infectious diseases, and neurological conditions. Furthermore, phage display has significantly contributed to the discovery of antibodies targeting specific viral pathogens, such as influenza and HIV, providing valuable tools for both diagnosis and treatment [7,8]. Beyond therapeutics, phage display has been instrumental in antibody engineering, epitope mapping, and the study of protein interactions. Additionally, it has facilitated the identification of novel peptide ligands for drug targeting, the development of biosensors for disease detection, and the creation of protein libraries for enzyme optimization and protein-protein interaction studies [9]. Overall, phage display continues to revolutionize biotechnology and biomedical research by enabling the rapid and efficient generation of high-affinity antibodies and protein-based therapeutics for a wide range of applications.\n\n## Categories of Phage Display Libraries for Antibody Development\nPhage libraries derived from rearranged V-gene repertoires are created using mRNA or RNA isolated from B cells obtained from either immunized or na\u00efve donors. The construction process entails initially preparing the cDNA template through reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Subsequently, the repertoire of variable heavy (VH) and variable light (VL) chain genes is amplified via PCR before being cloned into the phagemid vector [22]. While phage display technology has been widely used for novel antibody development, it is noteworthy that there are different types of phage display libraries after many years of development. \n\nAs one of the first libraries constructed, scFv libraries are commonly used for antibody selection. They consist of antibody fragments that include the VH and VL chains linked by a flexible peptide linker. This format allows the expression of functional antigen-binding sites in a single polypeptide chain. For instance, the Tomlinson I and J libraries are wellknown scFv libraries derived from human germline sequences. They offer a diverse source of antibody fragments for various applications. Another well-known application is the selection of scFv antibodies against specific tumor antigens using phage display, as demonstrated by Lee et al. [23]. In contrast, Fab libraries display antibody fragments that consist of the variable regions of both the heavy and light chains, along with the constant regions of the heavy chain. Fabs maintain the antigen-binding capacity of antibodies while providing additional structural stability. The HuCAL (Human Combinatorial Antibody Library) Fab library is a widely used human-derived library for the generation of Fab fragments with therapeutic potential [24]. In addition, a study by Gram et al. utilized a Fab phage display library to isolate antibodies specific to the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) [25]. \n\nIn addition to the libraries from human and mice, single-domain antibody (nanobody) libraries have been derived from the variable domains of the heavy-chain-only antibodies found in camelids, such as llamas and camels. Renowned for their unique structural and functional attributes, nanobodies are single polypeptide chains that retain the antigenbinding capabilities of conventional antibodies [26,27].\n...\nFor instance, Abicipar pegol, an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibody fragment, has been approved for the treatment of neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration. Belimumab (Benlysta), targeting the soluble B lymphocyte stimulator, which is involved in the survival and activation of B cells, is employed to reduce disease activity in systemic lupus erythematosus patients [37]. \n\nThe process of constructing these engineered antibodies follows a similar procedure. Initially, a phage library is generated by cloning a diverse array of antibody variable region sequences into a phage display vector. This library encompasses a broad spectrum of antibody fragments, each showcased on the surface of individual phage particles. Through multiple rounds of biopanning, phages displaying antibodies that specifically bind to the target antigen are selected from the library. These chosen phages are subsequently amplified and propagated to enrich for high-affinity binders. Finally, the DNA sequences encoding the variable regions of the selected antibodies are isolated and inserted into expression vectors for the production of full-length antibodies. Atezolizumab, for instance, was discovered through screening a human phage display library against a recombinant extracellular domain-Fc fusion of human PD-L1. From this screening, a high-affinity antibody was isolated from a single phage clone, utilizing a human IgG1 backbone. Due to PD-L1 expression on activated T cells, the Fc region of atezolizumab underwent engineering to abolish the antibody-dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC) effect. This engineering involved introducing an Asn to Ala substitution at position 298 within the CH2 domain of each heavy chain. As a result, atezolizumab was rendered incapable of binding to human Fc\u03b3 receptors. \n\nComparing the use of a phage-derived monoclonal antibody (mAb) to the original mAb in cancer treatment reveals several advantages of phage display-derived antibodies. Firstly, phage display allows for the generation of antibodies with enhanced specificity and affinity through iterative rounds of selection and optimization. This enables the identification of antibodies with superior binding properties compared to those obtained through traditional hybridoma-based methods [36].\n...\nThis enables the identification of antibodies with superior binding properties compared to those obtained through traditional hybridoma-based methods [36]. Additionally, phage display offers greater versatility in antibody engineering, allowing for the incorporation of specific modifications, such as humanization or affinity maturation, to improve therapeutic efficacy and reduce immunogenicity. Moreover, phage display-derived antibodies offer potential benefits in terms of manufacturing scalability and cost effectiveness. Unlike traditional mAbs produced from hybridoma cell lines, phage-derived antibodies can be generated entirely in vitro, eliminating the need for animal immunization and cell culture-based production systems. This streamlined production process enables rapid and cost-effective antibody development, making phage display an attractive platform for the generation of therapeutic antibodies [22].\n\n## Discussion of Challenges and Future Prospectives\nCancer, a complex and multifaceted group of diseases characterized by uncontrolled cell growth, remains a significant global health challenge. The development of effective cancer treatment drugs is crucial in addressing this pervasive issue [82][83][84]. Among the diverse arsenal of therapeutic approaches, antibodies play a pivotal role due to their precision in targeting specific molecules associated with cancer cells. In the contemporary landscape, phage display stands out as one of the most prevalent and robust systems for the discovery and development of antibodies. Its widespread adoption is attributed to several advantages, such as the manipulable size of the phage's genome, the efficient nature of phage infection, the cost effectiveness and safety associated with phage preparation and propagation, and the ability to perform high-throughput screening for peptides and antibodies. Additionally, the technology allows for rapid screening, contributing to its appeal [85]. Despite these numerous advantages, it is crucial to acknowledge that there are still areas within this technology that demand further enhancement and refinement to meet evolving needs. \n\nAn advantageous aspect of the phage display library, in comparison to other antibody development technologies, lies in its swift and convenient retrieval of peptide sequence information [14]. Typically, the assessment focuses on the most abundant sequences obtained from the panning output. However, a challenge arises when very few specific clones, carrying a small percentage of the sequence information, are acquired. This limitation is a result of the amplification bias of the desirable antibody-displaying phages during the panning cycles, causing certain sequences to become increasingly rare throughout the process. Furthermore, it is essential to acknowledge the potential divergence in conformation between chemically synthesized peptides and their original state on the phage display. The presence of multiple copies of exogenously displayed peptides on the phages can lead to robust binding during the selection process. Therefore, maintaining the authentic conformation of phage-derived peptides during chemical synthesis becomes crucial to ensure that their binding strength remains comparable to the original phages. Additionally, a recurring challenge in this technology is the occurrence of false positives during screening. This issue arises from the non-specific absorption that can preoccupy the phages before positive selection, emphasizing the need for strategies to mitigate false positives and enhance the accuracy of the screening process [86].\n...\nThis issue arises from the non-specific absorption that can preoccupy the phages before positive selection, emphasizing the need for strategies to mitigate false positives and enhance the accuracy of the screening process [86]. To address this issue, recent advancements have integrated next-generation sequencing technologies into the phage display library. This integration aims to identify the rare sequences holding potential binding affinity and predict the binding features of sequences obtained during the panning process [87,88]. \n\nThe phage display library finds another compelling application in the development of tumor-targeting peptides, particularly for diagnostic purposes [89,90]. These peptides play a pivotal role in creating imaging agents designed to specifically illuminate cancerous lesions. By associating with nanoparticle conjugation, these peptides not only enhance sensitivity in cancer diagnosis, but also contribute to improved contrast imaging capabilities. An inherent advantage of leveraging phage display libraries for tumor-targeting peptide development lies in the vast and diverse pool of peptide sequences that can be explored. This unique feature enables the discovery of peptides with the capacity to selectively recognize and bind to the distinctive molecular signatures present on the surface of cancer cells [48,91]. While fluorescent antibodies are currently employed in molecular imaging for their exceptional affinity and selectivity, peptides emerge as superior carriers for guiding imaging probes to tumor sites due to their effective tissue penetration-an attribute not easily achievable with antibodies. Despite its recognized potential, the clinical use of tumortargeting peptides has been limited, primarily due to challenges related to immunogenicity, clearance issues, and a lack of a comprehensive understanding of their behavior within the human body. Addressing these hurdles requires ongoing efforts to unlock the full potential of tumor-targeting peptides in the realm of cancer diagnostics, ensuring their effective and safe utilization in clinical settings. \n\nWhile phage display has matured into a well-established platform for antibody development, the commercial utilization of major phage display platforms, as outlined in Table 1, has predominantly been limited to a handful of biopharmaceutical companies holding intellectual property rights. Consequently, a majority of the antibodies developed today are owned by these companies with proprietary access to the underlying technologies.\n...\nMoreover, advances in library construction, selection methodologies, and molecular design have significantly improved the efficiency of isolating antibodies with high affinity, specificity, and reduced immunogenicity. Continuous innovations in phage display technology will help to overcome these obstructions, facilitating the development of antibodies for diagnostics, therapeutics, and various biotechnological applications.",

                    "text": "Numerous recombinant antibodies and peptides against pathogens and cancer antigens have been developed for diagnostic purposes using phage display.Peptides generated by phage display have the potential to be exploited for molecular imaging diagnostics in the field of cancer [19].These peptides can be employed in imaging various malignancies by conjugating or labeling them with nanoparticles, radionuclides, and fluorescents.The conventional method for tumor imaging is performed by monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with whole size.Peptides could be more effective than antibodies because of their low molecular weight which provides better tumor penetration and low immunogenicity because of lacking Fc regions [20,21].\n\nIn one study, for example, a peptide with specific binding capabilities to the extracellular domain of HER3 (HER3P1) was produced by the phage display technique [22].Traditional HER3 imaging, which uses a radiolabeled full-size antibody-like patritumab, does not lead to accurate PET imaging since these antibodies exhibit weak tumor penetration and non-specific accumulation in tissues that are not the target [23,24].It demonstrated that the radiolabeled HER3P1 had a potential for application in clinical imaging as it showed a great specificity and low background uptake by in vivo PET imaging [22].\n\nEmploying phage display, a diverse set of recombinant antibodies for pathogen detection (e.g., bacteria and viruses) has been developed.Since this technology comprises an in vitro screening procedure, it has eliminated the limitations and constraints of hybridoma technology [25].The majority of these antibodies, which are antibody fragments such as scFv, Fab, and nanobodies, are applied in ELISA, immunoblot, immunofluorescent assays, and immunoprecipitation [26].\n\nAlthough generating monoclonal antibodies is both an expensive and time-consuming task, they are widely deployed in immunological tests.In contrast, phage display allows for the quick collection of recombinant antibodies at a low cost and with the same affinity.Furthermore, in certain investigations, antibodies generated through phage display were more sensitive toward an antigen compared to other traditional techniques.",

It helps create antibodies that can specifically bind to complex antigens, which is crucial for identifying biomarkers and improving diagnostics and treatments. However, existing reviews often overlook its importance in areas outside cancer research. This review aims to fill that gap by explaining the basics of phage display and its applications in detecting and treating various non-cancerous diseases. We focus especially on its role in degenerative diseases, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, and chronic non-communicable diseases, showing how it is changing the way we diagnose and treat illnesses. By highlighting important discoveries and future possibilities, we hope to emphasize the significance of phage display in modern healthcare.\n## Introduction\nSeveral past re have explored the techniques and applications of phage display libraries, yet non specifically examined their role in non-cancerous diseases [10][11][12].Here, we will cover the basics of the technology, improvements made to enhance its effectivenes its common applications in non-cancerous diseases, including degenerative diseas flammatory and autoimmune conditions, and chronic non-communicable diseas also highlight selected therapeutic uses of recombinant antibodies and outline rece velopments in phage display technology.Phage display finds applications in various fields including enzyme inhibition, receptor modulation, epitope mapping, and vaccine development [9].Its versatility and potential for innovation suggest a promising future for the technique.Several past reviews have explored the techniques and applications of phage display libraries, yet none have specifically examined their role in non-cancerous diseases [10][11][12].Here, we will briefly cover the basics of the technology, improvements made to enhance its effectiveness, and its common applications in non-cancerous diseases, including degenerative diseases, inflammatory and autoimmune conditions, and chronic non-communicable diseases.We also highlight selected therapeutic uses of recombinant antibodies and outline recent developments in phage display technology.\n\n## The Diagnostic Effectiveness of Phage Display Technology\nNumerous recombinant antibodies and peptides against pathogens and cancer antigens have been developed for diagnostic purposes using phage display.Peptides generated by phage display have the potential to be exploited for molecular imaging diagnostics in the field of cancer [19].These peptides can be employed in imaging various malignancies by conjugating or labeling them with nanoparticles, radionuclides, and fluorescents.The conventional method for tumor imaging is performed by monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with whole size.Peptides could be more effective than antibodies because of their low molecular weight which provides better tumor penetration and low immunogenicity because of lacking Fc regions [20,21].\n\nIn one study, for example, a peptide with specific binding capabilities to the extracellular domain of HER3 (HER3P1) was produced by the phage display technique [22].Traditional HER3 imaging, which uses a radiolabeled full-size antibody-like patritumab, does not lead to accurate PET imaging since these antibodies exhibit weak tumor penetration and non-specific accumulation in tissues that are not the target [23,24].It demonstrated that the radiolabeled HER3P1 had a potential for application in clinical imaging as it showed a great specificity and low background uptake by in vivo PET imaging [22].\n\nEmploying phage display, a diverse set of recombinant antibodies for pathogen detection (e.g., bacteria and viruses) has been developed.Since this technology comprises an in vitro screening procedure, it has eliminated the limitations and constraints of hybridoma technology [25].The majority of these antibodies, which are antibody fragments such as scFv, Fab, and nanobodies, are applied in ELISA, immunoblot, immunofluorescent assays, and immunoprecipitation [26].\n\nAlthough generating monoclonal antibodies is both an expensive and time-consuming task, they are widely deployed in immunological tests.In contrast, phage display allows for the quick collection of recombinant antibodies at a low cost and with the same affinity.Furthermore, in certain investigations, antibodies generated through phage display were more sensitive toward an antigen compared to other traditional techniques.\n...\nFurthermore, in certain investigations, antibodies generated through phage display were more sensitive toward an antigen compared to other traditional techniques.A peptide that binds the spike protein of the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) was developed by Suo and colleagues using phage display for diagnostic purposes.It was discovered that phage-mediated ELISA was more sensitive than conventional antibody-based ELISA [27].\n\nIn a recent investigation, Sulong et al. used phage display to design a VH antibody against capsular polysaccharide (CPS) of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (Figure 2A).It has been demonstrated that this VH antibody has the potential to be a useful diagnostic instrument for S. suis serotype differentiation since similar epitopes are shared by serotypes 1, 1/2, 2, and 14 (Figure 2B) [28,29].The positive phage clone 47B3 displaying VH antibody disclosed the highest binding ability with no cross-reactivity with S. suis serotypes 1/2, 1, or 14, whereas prior mAbs against S. suis serotype 2 have revealed cross-reactivity with serotypes 2, 1/2, 1, and 14.Furthermore, the pure VH antibody (namely 47B3 VH) has the remarkable ability to discriminate between serotypes 2 and 1/2 effectively (Figure 2C), which is not possible to be detected by PCR-based serotyping [30].The purpose of this review is to highlight the applications of phage display as a therapeutic and diagnostic tool in non-cancerous diseases.Additionally, a very recent study developed an innovative method to characterize exosomes using phage display technology.This breakthrough system for detecting and isolating disease-related exosomes could be useful in defining novel biomarkers to treat diseases where exosomes are involved [31].\n\n## Conclusions\nPhage display technology has become significantly prevalent across various fields, notably in the identification of biomarkers, the study of molecular interactions, and the enhancement of drug delivery mechanisms.Furthermore, this technology is predicted to be a potent framework for leading breakthrough therapy and diagnostics in the long term.Phages have the ability to overcome environmental stresses that are present in experimental settings including ultraviolet (UV) radiation [145,146], adverse temperature and pH conditions [147], and proteolytic enzymes [148], making them promising candidates for biosensing under these severe conditions [149].Due to its resilience and remarkable stability, it is considered the benchmark for monoclonal antibody isolation.A total of 80 monoclonal antibodies have been extracted by phage display technology and are currently undergoing clinical trials, with 7 approved products, so far.\n\nDespite the numerous potential benefits of antibody phage display technology, certain intrinsic restrictions still exist.For example, several characteristics influence the size of the libraries, which is important for reaching the intended affinities.This can be a pricey and tedious operation.Additionally, phages can only produce fragments of antibodies (like scFv and Fab), therefore it could be challenging to create conjugated antibodies owing to their small size.The benefits of phage display technology outweigh the drawbacks.",

Perhaps the best-known application of phages is phage display that refers to the expression of foreign peptides or proteins outside the phage virion as a fusion with one of the phage coat proteins. In 2018, one half of the Nobel prize in chemistry was awarded jointly to George P. Smith and Sir Gregory P. Winter \u201cfor the phage display of peptides and antibodies.\u201d The outstanding technology has evolved and developed considerably since its first description in 1985, and today phage display is commonly used in a wide variety of disciplines, including drug discovery, enzyme optimization, biomolecular interaction studies, as well as biosensor development. A cornerstone of all biosensors, regardless of the sensor platform or transduction scheme used, is a sensitive and selective bioreceptor, or a recognition element, that can provide specific binding to the target analyte. Many environmentally or pharmacologically interesting target analytes might not have naturally appropriate binding partners for biosensor development, but phage display can facilitate the production of novel receptors beyond known biomolecular interactions, or against toxic or nonimmunogenic targets, making the technology a valuable tool in the quest of new recognition elements for biosensor development.",

Benito-Pe\u00f1a, R. Barderas, M. Moreno-Bondi\n## Abstract\nPhages are bacterial viruses that have gained a significant role in biotechnology owing to their widely studied biology and many advantageous characteristics. Perhaps the best-known application of phages is phage display that refers to the expression of foreign peptides or proteins outside the phage virion as a fusion with one of the phage coat proteins. In 2018, one half of the Nobel prize in chemistry was awarded jointly to George P. Smith and Sir Gregory P. Winter \u201cfor the phage display of peptides and antibodies.\u201d The outstanding technology has evolved and developed considerably since its first description in 1985, and today phage display is commonly used in a wide variety of disciplines, including drug discovery, enzyme optimization, biomolecular interaction studies, as well as biosensor development. A cornerstone of all biosensors, regardless of the sensor platform or transduction scheme used, is a sensitive and selective bioreceptor, or a recognition element, that can provide specific binding to the target analyte. Many environmentally or pharmacologically interesting target analytes might not have naturally appropriate binding partners for biosensor development, but phage display can facilitate the production of novel receptors beyond known biomolecular interactions, or against toxic or nonimmunogenic targets, making the technology a valuable tool in the quest of new recognition elements for biosensor development.\n## ACS Omega\nntibody fragments originating from phage-displayed libraries have been reported for various protein targets, such as scFv against dengue virus nonstructural protein 103 or single variable domain antibodies (V HH ) from camel against prostatespecific antigen (PSA) that were applied to PSA detection by SPR. 104,105 Also, various peptide binders against protein targets have been selected by phage display, for example, for the development of biosensors applied to the analysis of protein targets, such as cholera toxin, 106 troponin I, 107 prostate-specific antigen, 108 norovirus capsid proteins, 109,110 alanine aminotransferase, 111 and sepsis 112 or dengue fever biomarkers. 113 ecently, a SERS biosensor based on M13 phages that display cysteine-rich peptides on the pVIII was developed for triplex assay in sepsis diagnosis. The assays on magnetic templates with picomolar detection limits was described as a promising alternative for early clinical diagnosis of sepsis. 114 mall-molecule targets, haptens, which might be challenging targets for antibody development, have been also successfully used to develop antibodies by phage display.

            "abstract": "The search for innovative anti-cancer drugs remains a challenge. Over the past three decades, antibodies have emerged as an essential asset in successful cancer therapy. The major obstacle in developing anti-cancer antibodies is the need for non-immunogenic antibodies against human antigens. This unique requirement highlights a disadvantage to using traditional hybridoma technology and thus demands alternative approaches, such as humanizing murine monoclonal antibodies. To overcome these hurdles, human monoclonal antibodies can be obtained directly from Phage Display libraries, a groundbreaking tool for antibody selection. These libraries consist of genetically engineered viruses, or phages, which can exhibit antibody fragments, such as scFv or Fab on their capsid. This innovation allows the in vitro selection of novel molecules directed towards cancer antigens. As foreseen when Phage Display was first described, nowadays, several Phage Display-derived antibodies have entered clinical settings or are undergoing clinical evaluation. This comprehensive review unveils the remarkable progress in this field and the possibilities of using clever strategies for phage selection and tailoring the refinement of antibodies aimed at increasingly specific targets. Moreover, the use of selected antibodies in cutting-edge formats is discussed, such as CAR (chimeric antigen receptor) in CAR T-cell therapy or ADC (antibody drug conjugate), amplifying the spectrum of potential therapeutic avenues.",

                    "text": "Phage Display has been widely applied to develop novel therapeutic antibodies. Impressively, 18% of all antibodies commercially approved owe their origins to this technology. Most of the Phage Display-derived antibodies that have gained clinical approval have been tailored for deployment in cancer (36%) and immunoregulation (32%) applications (Figure 1A) (Table 1). \n\nsubjects, are difficult to find, but even non-immunized human libraries have been used successfully to obtain high-affinity antibodies against either self-or non-self-antigens [17]. \n\nPhage Display libraries can also be developed from variants of a single antibody. One of these approaches relies on the use of directed evolution to select high-affinity mutants from a scFv library that has been randomly mutated through error-prone PCR (epPCR), as previously described [18,19]. Random mutagenesis might be useful to obtain mature antibodies with different kinetic parameters (different association/dissociation rates). Direct evolution of antibody affinity can also be accomplished using libraries of CDRs (complementary determinant regions) of variable domains, mainly CDR3H. CDR3H variants were randomly generated using degenerate oligonucleotides where codons such as NNS were used, raising the possibility of any of the twenty amino acids being coded, while reducing the change to an unwanted stop-codon [20]. Antibody fragments may also be isolated from infected organisms [21][22][23], as demonstrated by selecting Fab fragments from HIV-1-positive individuals. This is particularly interesting for infectious diseases as these subjects are considered immunized and, therefore, produce higher--affinity antibodies. This strategy has also been previously Since the early 1990s, when Phage Display started to become a popular strategy to select antibody fragments, several types of libraries have been developed. One of the first libraries constructed [15] used mouse scFv and Fab fragments. In the same year, Barbas III and co-workers (1991) developed a protocol to construct combinatorial libraries from human repertoire based on Fab fragments [16]. These libraries rely on the random rearrangement of heavy and light chains amplified from immune cells, either from immunized or na\u00efve animals.",

Studart, M. Bezerra, Larissa Queiroz Pontes, Antonio Marcos Aires Barbosa, M. Brigido, G. Furtado, A. Maranh\u00e3o\n## Abstract\nThe search for innovative anti-cancer drugs remains a challenge. Over the past three decades, antibodies have emerged as an essential asset in successful cancer therapy. The major obstacle in developing anti-cancer antibodies is the need for non-immunogenic antibodies against human antigens. This unique requirement highlights a disadvantage to using traditional hybridoma technology and thus demands alternative approaches, such as humanizing murine monoclonal antibodies. To overcome these hurdles, human monoclonal antibodies can be obtained directly from Phage Display libraries, a groundbreaking tool for antibody selection. These libraries consist of genetically engineered viruses, or phages, which can exhibit antibody fragments, such as scFv or Fab on their capsid. This innovation allows the in vitro selection of novel molecules directed towards cancer antigens. As foreseen when Phage Display was first described, nowadays, several Phage Display-derived antibodies have entered clinical settings or are undergoing clinical evaluation. This comprehensive review unveils the remarkable progress in this field and the possibilities of using clever strategies for phage selection and tailoring the refinement of antibodies aimed at increasingly specific targets. Moreover, the use of selected antibodies in cutting-edge formats is discussed, such as CAR (chimeric antigen receptor) in CAR T-cell therapy or ADC (antibody drug conjugate), amplifying the spectrum of potential therapeutic avenues.\n## Main Types of Phage Display Libraries Used to Select Antibodies\nPhage Display has been widely applied to develop novel therapeutic antibodies. Impressively, 18% of all antibodies commercially approved owe their origins to this technology. Most of the Phage Display-derived antibodies that have gained clinical approval have been tailored for deployment in cancer (36%) and immunoregulation (32%) applications (Figure 1A) (Table 1). \n\nsubjects, are difficult to find, but even non-immunized human libraries have been used successfully to obtain high-affinity antibodies against either self-or non-self-antigens [17]. \n\nPhage Display libraries can also be developed from variants of a single antibody. One of these approaches relies on the use of directed evolution to select high-affinity mutants from a scFv library that has been randomly mutated through error-prone PCR (epPCR), as previously described [18,19]. Random mutagenesis might be useful to obtain mature antibodies with different kinetic parameters (different association/dissociation rates). Direct evolution of antibody affinity can also be accomplished using libraries of CDRs (complementary determinant regions) of variable domains, mainly CDR3H. CDR3H variants were randomly generated using degenerate oligonucleotides where codons such as NNS were used, raising the possibility of any of the twenty amino acids being coded, while reducing the change to an unwanted stop-codon [20]. Antibody fragments may also be isolated from infected organisms [21][22][23], as demonstrated by selecting Fab fragments from HIV-1-positive individuals. This is particularly interesting for infectious diseases as these subjects are considered immunized and, therefore, produce higher--affinity antibodies. This strategy has also been previously Since the early 1990s, when Phage Display started to become a popular strategy to select antibody fragments, several types of libraries have been developed. One of the first libraries constructed [15] used mouse scFv and Fab fragments. In the same year, Barbas III and co-workers (1991) developed a protocol to construct combinatorial libraries from human repertoire based on Fab fragments [16]. These libraries rely on the random rearrangement of heavy and light chains amplified from immune cells, either from immunized or na\u00efve animals.\n\n## Conclusions\nRecent advances in cancer therapy have been boosted by the application of antibodies derived from Phage Display libraries. The importance of this approach has been recognized by the scientific community through the 2018 Nobel Prize in Chemistry \"for the Phage Display of peptides and antibodies\", awarded to George P. Smith and Gregory P. Winter. This methodology involves biopanning of specific antibodies that can bind to different targets, such as cancer cell markers, with remarkable specificity and affinity. The potential to screen extensive libraries of phage-displayed antibodies, along with numerous available selection approaches, underscores the increasing promise of utilizing phage-derived antibodies as a highly favorable resource for advancing therapeutic product development focused on cancer-specific antibody treatments. Despite being almost 40 years old and amidst the ongoing methodological progress in target and ligand discovery, Phage Display technology remains a crucial tool in various cutting-edge research fronts, being part of the horizon of perspectives and innovations in oncology.",

            "abstract": "Passive immunization (passive immunity, passive immunotherapy) consists in the transfer of specific antibodies to an unprotected individual with the purpose of protecting from infection or treatment of the disease. Passive immunization is acquired either naturally (maternal antibodies cross the placenta to reach the fetus) or artificially when the patient is transfused with high-titer antibodies of human or animal origin or developed by genetic engineering (monoclonal antibodies, MAb). The beginnings of passive immunization date back to the end of the XIX century when Emil Adolf von Behring was the first to use antibodies of animal origin in the treatment of diphtheria and tetanus. In Poland, the Lublin Factory of Serum and Vaccines established in 1951 launched an industrial-scale production of immune sera against diphtheria, scarlet fever, measles, meningitis and poliomyelitis (Heine Medin disease). Passive immunization is relied on for prevention of infection, for treatment of immunodeficiency disorders (including hypogammaglobulinemia), acute infections and poisoning. Immunity derived from passive immunization lasts for a few weeks to about four months. Since December 2019, the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has initiated numerous randomized trials focused on determining the effectiveness of convalescent plasma therapy for COVID-19 infected patients. In order to minimize the occurrence of adverse reactions following the administration of convalescent plasma, attempts have been made to produce hyperimmune anti-SARS-CoV-2 globulin (hIVIG). It is also worthwhile to mention that there are ongoing clinical trials on anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin concentrate developed by Polish researchers under the supervision of Professor Tomasiewicz and in cooperation with BIOMED-LUBLIN (Project No. 2020/ABM/COVID19/0036).",

This technique mimics the natural process of antibody production with increasing affinity for an antigen. A similar effect is attained in laboratory conditions/in vitro by developing second-generation libraries comprising variants of higher affinity to antigen [13]. \n\nThe antibody fragments acquired as result of selection are screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and then sequenced to identify the most common variable regions used by the immune system to elicit antibody response. Antibody fragments produced by bacterial colonies are typically purified by affinity chromatography. Through analysis of selected antibodies it is possible to determine the precise constant kinetics of the antigen-antibody binding. \n\nIn the same way scFv format antibodies are produced against haptens, proteins, carbohydrates, receptors, tumor antigens or viruses. They find application in therapy or in a variety of diagnostic kits. \n\nAntibodies for therapeutic/clinical use may also be linked with cytostatic drugs (antibody--drug conjugates, ADCP) or radioisotopes for more effective delivery to target tissues. Phage Display technology is successfully used by many pharmaceutical companies in their scientific quest for biological drugs. Examples of commercially available human therapeutic antibodies obtained with Phage Display technique are: Humira (adalimumab) -an antibody directed against tumor necrosis factor a (TNFa) which -among others -is applied in the management of rheumatoid arthritis and Benlysta (belimumab) -human IgG1 directed against the B lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS), a soluble ligand of the TNF family cytokines, which are used in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus. Under clinical trials are other antibodies from phage libraries [14]. \n\nThe validity and effectiveness of Phage Display technique for obtaining high-specificity human antibodies of therapeutic potential have been confirmed. Other technologies have also been developed based on chimeric monoclonal antibodies in which the mouse antibody is \"humanized\".",

Lachert\n## Abstract\nPassive immunization (passive immunity, passive immunotherapy) consists in the transfer of specific antibodies to an unprotected individual with the purpose of protecting from infection or treatment of the disease. Passive immunization is acquired either naturally (maternal antibodies cross the placenta to reach the fetus) or artificially when the patient is transfused with high-titer antibodies of human or animal origin or developed by genetic engineering (monoclonal antibodies, MAb). The beginnings of passive immunization date back to the end of the XIX century when Emil Adolf von Behring was the first to use antibodies of animal origin in the treatment of diphtheria and tetanus. In Poland, the Lublin Factory of Serum and Vaccines established in 1951 launched an industrial-scale production of immune sera against diphtheria, scarlet fever, measles, meningitis and poliomyelitis (Heine Medin disease). Passive immunization is relied on for prevention of infection, for treatment of immunodeficiency disorders (including hypogammaglobulinemia), acute infections and poisoning. Immunity derived from passive immunization lasts for a few weeks to about four months. Since December 2019, the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has initiated numerous randomized trials focused on determining the effectiveness of convalescent plasma therapy for COVID-19 infected patients. In order to minimize the occurrence of adverse reactions following the administration of convalescent plasma, attempts have been made to produce hyperimmune anti-SARS-CoV-2 globulin (hIVIG). It is also worthwhile to mention that there are ongoing clinical trials on anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin concentrate developed by Polish researchers under the supervision of Professor Tomasiewicz and in cooperation with BIOMED-LUBLIN (Project No. 2020/ABM/COVID19/0036).\n## History of passive immunization\nScreening of phage libraries allows to select (from phage pools) the specific phage that interacts with the selected antigen [12]. \n\nAntibody variants acquired through Phage Display technique may additionally be subjected to the affinity maturation process. This technique mimics the natural process of antibody production with increasing affinity for an antigen. A similar effect is attained in laboratory conditions/in vitro by developing second-generation libraries comprising variants of higher affinity to antigen [13]. \n\nThe antibody fragments acquired as result of selection are screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and then sequenced to identify the most common variable regions used by the immune system to elicit antibody response. Antibody fragments produced by bacterial colonies are typically purified by affinity chromatography. Through analysis of selected antibodies it is possible to determine the precise constant kinetics of the antigen-antibody binding. \n\nIn the same way scFv format antibodies are produced against haptens, proteins, carbohydrates, receptors, tumor antigens or viruses. They find application in therapy or in a variety of diagnostic kits. \n\nAntibodies for therapeutic/clinical use may also be linked with cytostatic drugs (antibody--drug conjugates, ADCP) or radioisotopes for more effective delivery to target tissues. Phage Display technology is successfully used by many pharmaceutical companies in their scientific quest for biological drugs. Examples of commercially available human therapeutic antibodies obtained with Phage Display technique are: Humira (adalimumab) -an antibody directed against tumor necrosis factor a (TNFa) which -among others -is applied in the management of rheumatoid arthritis and Benlysta (belimumab) -human IgG1 directed against the B lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS), a soluble ligand of the TNF family cytokines, which are used in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus. Under clinical trials are other antibodies from phage libraries [14]. \n\nThe validity and effectiveness of Phage Display technique for obtaining high-specificity human antibodies of therapeutic potential have been confirmed. Other technologies have also been developed based on chimeric monoclonal antibodies in which the mouse antibody is \"humanized\".",

Many research institutes, start-ups and industrial laboratories are continually developing methods for the design, construction and screening of developable antibodyphage libraries. Further improvements are expected to be achieved in the near future as this technology contributes significantly toward research, diagnosis, and therapy.",

Several antibodies have also shown good prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy in relevant animal models of viral disease. Surprisingly, only one antiviral mAb has been licensed to date; it is used to prevent infection with respiratory syncytial virus in at-risk infants. Certain paradigms of mAbs prevailing in industry and academia are obstacles to the development of further antiviral antibodies for clinical use. There is a perception that mAbs are much more effective in prophylactic than therapeutic use, offer limited breadth of protection against different viral strains, are prone to select neutralization escape variants and need to be given in high doses, which are still comparatively costly to manufacture. Based on a review of the literature and our own data, we propose that by combining two or more non- competing neutralizing antibodies, viral escape can effectively be controlled and in case of synergistic action of the mAbs it may be possible to significantly reduce the total antibody concentration required for protection. The combination of mAbs with specific antiviral drugs has the potential to expand their use from pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis to therapy of acute and chronic viral infections.",

The V H and V L genes are diversified with random mutagenesis to yield high affinity antibodies (Boder et al. 2000). Other formats including surface display on E. coli and Bacillus strains, retroviral display, display based on protein-DNA linkeage and others have either specific technical disadvantages or are not yet mature enough for commercial use. \n\nPhage display is currently the most popular molecular technology used to tap into the human antibody repertoire (Hoogenboom 2005). As table 1 shows, in vitro and in vivo neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies have been generated against a variety of virus from diverse families by phage display. \n\nAll variable, antigen binding regions of the heavy and light chains, termed V H and V L , are cloned from the lymphocytes of a donor and expressed as single-chain antibodies (V H -V L ) fused to the pIII surface protein of a bacteriophage. The resulting vast repertoire (\"library\") of different antibody carrying phages ideally mirrors the antibody repertoire of the donor. Cloning of all different antigen binding regions is possible because the hypervariable regions which are responsible for antigen specificity (CDRs) are flanked by constant regions (framework regions, FR) which correspond to families of germline antibody genes for which the genetic sequences are available. Because the heavy and light chains are amplified and cloned by two separate PCR reactions, the library also contains pairings not present in the donor lymphocytes, which further increases its size. The antibody phages are incubated with the antigen of interest and specifically binding phages are rescued together with the genetic information coding for the specific antibody gene. Both the cloning and the selection procedure are very powerful, allowing essentially to generate a repertoire of 10 8 -10 9 different molecules and extracting the desired antibody specificity from a single test tube.",

Meulen, J. Goudsmit\n## Abstract\nMonoclonal antibody (mAb) technology has reached a state of maturity making it possible to rapidly discover and produce fully human mAbs which neutralize any given virus in vitro. Several antibodies have also shown good prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy in relevant animal models of viral disease. Surprisingly, only one antiviral mAb has been licensed to date; it is used to prevent infection with respiratory syncytial virus in at-risk infants. Certain paradigms of mAbs prevailing in industry and academia are obstacles to the development of further antiviral antibodies for clinical use. There is a perception that mAbs are much more effective in prophylactic than therapeutic use, offer limited breadth of protection against different viral strains, are prone to select neutralization escape variants and need to be given in high doses, which are still comparatively costly to manufacture. Based on a review of the literature and our own data, we propose that by combining two or more non- competing neutralizing antibodies, viral escape can effectively be controlled and in case of synergistic action of the mAbs it may be possible to significantly reduce the total antibody concentration required for protection. The combination of mAbs with specific antiviral drugs has the potential to expand their use from pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis to therapy of acute and chronic viral infections.\n## Human Monoclonal Antibodies and Antivirals\nDue to the error-prone process of reverse transcription and amplification, the system's most successful application is the affinity maturation of antibodies. \n\nSurface display on yeast (S. cerevisiae) allows for selection of antibody repertoires by cell flow cytometry. The V H and V L genes are diversified with random mutagenesis to yield high affinity antibodies (Boder et al. 2000). Other formats including surface display on E. coli and Bacillus strains, retroviral display, display based on protein-DNA linkeage and others have either specific technical disadvantages or are not yet mature enough for commercial use. \n\nPhage display is currently the most popular molecular technology used to tap into the human antibody repertoire (Hoogenboom 2005). As table 1 shows, in vitro and in vivo neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies have been generated against a variety of virus from diverse families by phage display. \n\nAll variable, antigen binding regions of the heavy and light chains, termed V H and V L , are cloned from the lymphocytes of a donor and expressed as single-chain antibodies (V H -V L ) fused to the pIII surface protein of a bacteriophage. The resulting vast repertoire (\"library\") of different antibody carrying phages ideally mirrors the antibody repertoire of the donor. Cloning of all different antigen binding regions is possible because the hypervariable regions which are responsible for antigen specificity (CDRs) are flanked by constant regions (framework regions, FR) which correspond to families of germline antibody genes for which the genetic sequences are available. Because the heavy and light chains are amplified and cloned by two separate PCR reactions, the library also contains pairings not present in the donor lymphocytes, which further increases its size. The antibody phages are incubated with the antigen of interest and specifically binding phages are rescued together with the genetic information coding for the specific antibody gene. Both the cloning and the selection procedure are very powerful, allowing essentially to generate a repertoire of 10 8 -10 9 different molecules and extracting the desired antibody specificity from a single test tube.",

            "abstract": "Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) affects cloven-hoofed domestic and wildlife animals and an outbreak can cause severe losses in milk production, reduction in meat production and death amongst young animals. Several parts of Asia, most of Africa, and the Middle East remain endemic, thus emphasis on improved FMD vaccines, diagnostic assays, and control measures are key research areas. FMD virus (FMDV) populations are quasispecies, which pose serious implications in vaccine design and efficacy where an effective vaccine should include multiple independent neutralizing epitopes to elicit an adequate immune response. Further investigation of the residues that comprise the antigenic determinants of the virus will allow the identification of mutations in outbreak strains that potentially lessen the efficacy of a vaccine. Additionally, of utmost importance in endemic regions, is the accurate diagnosis of FMDV infection for the control and eradication of the disease. To this end, a phage display library was explored to identify FMDV epitopes for recombinant vaccines and for the generation of reagents for improved diagnostic FMD enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). A na\u00efve semi-synthetic chicken single chain variable fragment (scFv) phage display library i.e., the Nkuku\u00ae library was used for bio-panning against FMD Southern-African Territories (SAT) 1, SAT3, and serotype A viruses. Biopanning yielded one unique scFv against SAT1, two for SAT3, and nine for A22. SAT1 and SAT3 specific scFvs were exploited as capturing and detecting reagents to develop an improved diagnostic ELISA for FMDV. The SAT1 soluble scFv showed potential as a detecting reagent in the liquid phase blocking ELISA (LPBE) as it reacted specifically with a panel of SAT1 viruses, albeit with different ELISA absorbance signals. The SAT1svFv1 had little or no change on its paratope when coated on polystyrene plates whilst the SAT3scFv's paratope may have changed. SAT1 and SAT3 soluble scFvs did not neutralize the SAT1 and SAT3 viruses; however, three of the nine A22 binders i.e., A22scFv1, A22scFv2, and A22scFv8 were able to neutralize A22 virus. Following the generation of virus escape mutants through successive virus passage under scFv pressure, FMDV epitopes were postulated i.e., RGD+3 and +4 positions respectively, proving the epitope mapping potential of scFvs.",

                    "text": "Diagnostic assays hampered by the lack of specificity caused by polyclonal capture and detection antibodies highlighted the need for more specific tests. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific reagents and are being used for a variety of research and diagnostic purposes within the FMD field and their pivotal role in all aspects of FMD research is now clear. However, traditional monoclonal antibodies, produced using hybridoma technology, and used in diagnostics have several limitations such as its high cost, time-consuming production, and the expertise required (32)(33)(34). \n\nThe development of large combinatorial antibody libraries based on antibody genes expressed and displayed on phages have revolutionized the selection and isolation of unique antibodies to an antigen and aided in the development of recombinant reagents for ELISA (35). A key advantage of phage display of antibody fragments is that the generation of specific singlechain variable fragment (scFv) or antigen binding fragment (Fab) to a particular antigen can be completed within a few weeks compared to hybridomas taking months. Antibody libraries can be either immune (from immunized donors) or na\u00efve (from non-immunized donors). An immune library will have an antibody range that is highly enriched for antibodies generated in response to a particular immunogen, whereas, the na\u00efve library can advantageously be used for an unlimited array of immunogens (36). \n\nPhage display libraries have been used with success to map epitopes for FMDV for serotype O (37,38) and the SAT2 serotype (25). The Nkuku R phage-display library, which is a large semisynthetic library of recombinant filamentous bacteriophages displaying scFv's derived from combinatorial pairings of chicken variable heavy and light chains, was used for this study (36). This na\u00efve library has been utilized to generate a variety of antibodies against antigens such as the bluetongue virus, African horse sickness virus, echovirus 1, coxsackievirus B3, FMDV of the SAT2 serotype as well as a mycobacterial 16 kDa antigen (25,36,(39)(40)(41)(42).",

Maree\n## Abstract\nFoot-and-mouth disease (FMD) affects cloven-hoofed domestic and wildlife animals and an outbreak can cause severe losses in milk production, reduction in meat production and death amongst young animals. Several parts of Asia, most of Africa, and the Middle East remain endemic, thus emphasis on improved FMD vaccines, diagnostic assays, and control measures are key research areas. FMD virus (FMDV) populations are quasispecies, which pose serious implications in vaccine design and efficacy where an effective vaccine should include multiple independent neutralizing epitopes to elicit an adequate immune response. Further investigation of the residues that comprise the antigenic determinants of the virus will allow the identification of mutations in outbreak strains that potentially lessen the efficacy of a vaccine. Additionally, of utmost importance in endemic regions, is the accurate diagnosis of FMDV infection for the control and eradication of the disease. To this end, a phage display library was explored to identify FMDV epitopes for recombinant vaccines and for the generation of reagents for improved diagnostic FMD enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). A na\u00efve semi-synthetic chicken single chain variable fragment (scFv) phage display library i.e., the Nkuku\u00ae library was used for bio-panning against FMD Southern-African Territories (SAT) 1, SAT3, and serotype A viruses. Biopanning yielded one unique scFv against SAT1, two for SAT3, and nine for A22. SAT1 and SAT3 specific scFvs were exploited as capturing and detecting reagents to develop an improved diagnostic ELISA for FMDV. The SAT1 soluble scFv showed potential as a detecting reagent in the liquid phase blocking ELISA (LPBE) as it reacted specifically with a panel of SAT1 viruses, albeit with different ELISA absorbance signals. The SAT1svFv1 had little or no change on its paratope when coated on polystyrene plates whilst the SAT3scFv's paratope may have changed. SAT1 and SAT3 soluble scFvs did not neutralize the SAT1 and SAT3 viruses; however, three of the nine A22 binders i.e., A22scFv1, A22scFv2, and A22scFv8 were able to neutralize A22 virus. Following the generation of virus escape mutants through successive virus passage under scFv pressure, FMDV epitopes were postulated i.e., RGD+3 and +4 positions respectively, proving the epitope mapping potential of scFvs.\n## INTRODUCTION\nDiagnostic assays hampered by the lack of specificity caused by polyclonal capture and detection antibodies highlighted the need for more specific tests. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific reagents and are being used for a variety of research and diagnostic purposes within the FMD field and their pivotal role in all aspects of FMD research is now clear. However, traditional monoclonal antibodies, produced using hybridoma technology, and used in diagnostics have several limitations such as its high cost, time-consuming production, and the expertise required (32)(33)(34). \n\nThe development of large combinatorial antibody libraries based on antibody genes expressed and displayed on phages have revolutionized the selection and isolation of unique antibodies to an antigen and aided in the development of recombinant reagents for ELISA (35). A key advantage of phage display of antibody fragments is that the generation of specific singlechain variable fragment (scFv) or antigen binding fragment (Fab) to a particular antigen can be completed within a few weeks compared to hybridomas taking months. Antibody libraries can be either immune (from immunized donors) or na\u00efve (from non-immunized donors). An immune library will have an antibody range that is highly enriched for antibodies generated in response to a particular immunogen, whereas, the na\u00efve library can advantageously be used for an unlimited array of immunogens (36). \n\nPhage display libraries have been used with success to map epitopes for FMDV for serotype O (37,38) and the SAT2 serotype (25). The Nkuku R phage-display library, which is a large semisynthetic library of recombinant filamentous bacteriophages displaying scFv's derived from combinatorial pairings of chicken variable heavy and light chains, was used for this study (36). This na\u00efve library has been utilized to generate a variety of antibodies against antigens such as the bluetongue virus, African horse sickness virus, echovirus 1, coxsackievirus B3, FMDV of the SAT2 serotype as well as a mycobacterial 16 kDa antigen (25,36,(39)(40)(41)(42).",

To accommodate the increased interest in biomedical applications of antibodies, antibody phage display technology has provided an alternative for rapid discovery and broad utilisation of novel, highly specific and fully human antibodies [167].\n\nSince the introduction of monoclonal antibody technology by Kohler and Milstein in 1975, antibodies have become important biomolecules due to their capability to be applied in various fields, and most importantly in diagnostic, therapeutics, and vaccine development [168].

Isolated scFv and Fab antibody fragments against native spores of Bacillus subtilis IFO 3336 were labelled with two different fluorescent dyes (FITC or rhodamine-N-hydroxysuccinimide) for direct and indirect detection by fluorescence microscope.

            "abstract": "Combinatorial biology methods offer a good solution for targeting interactions of specif ic molecules by a high-throughput screening and are widely used for drug development, diagnostics, identif ication of novel monoclonal antibodies, search for linear peptide mimetics of discontinuous epitopes for the development of immunogens or vaccine components. Among all currently available techniques, phage display remains one of the most popular approaches. Despite being a fairly old method, phage display is still widely used for studying protein-protein, peptide-protein and DNA-protein interactions due to its relative simplicity and versatility. Phage display allows highly representative libraries of peptides, proteins or their fragments to be created. Each phage particle in a library displays peptides or proteins fused to its coat protein and simultaneously carries the DNA sequence encoding the displayed peptide/protein in its genome. The biopanning procedure allows isolation of specif ic clones for almost any target, and due to the physical link between the genotype and the phenotype of recombinant phage particles it is possible to determine the structure of selected molecules. Phage display technology continues to play an important role in HIV research. A major obstacle to the development of an effective HIV vaccine is an extensive genetic and antigenic variability of the virus. According to recent data, in order to provide protection against HIV infection, the so-called broadly neutralizing antibodies that are cross-reactive against multiple viral strains of HIV must be induced, which makes the identif ication of such antibodies a key area of HIV vaccinology. In this review, we discuss the use of phage display as a tool for identif ication of HIV-specif ic antibodies with broad neutralizing activity. We provide an outline of phage display technology, brief ly describe the design of antibody phage libraries and the affinity selection procedure, and discuss the biology of HIV-1-specif ic broadly neutralizing antibodies. Finally, we summarize the studies aimed at identif ication of broadly neutralizing antibodies using various types of phage libraries.",

Chikaev, A. Rudometov, Yu. A. Merkulyeva, L. Karpenko\n## Abstract\nCombinatorial biology methods offer a good solution for targeting interactions of specif ic molecules by a high-throughput screening and are widely used for drug development, diagnostics, identif ication of novel monoclonal antibodies, search for linear peptide mimetics of discontinuous epitopes for the development of immunogens or vaccine components. Among all currently available techniques, phage display remains one of the most popular approaches. Despite being a fairly old method, phage display is still widely used for studying protein-protein, peptide-protein and DNA-protein interactions due to its relative simplicity and versatility. Phage display allows highly representative libraries of peptides, proteins or their fragments to be created. Each phage particle in a library displays peptides or proteins fused to its coat protein and simultaneously carries the DNA sequence encoding the displayed peptide/protein in its genome. The biopanning procedure allows isolation of specif ic clones for almost any target, and due to the physical link between the genotype and the phenotype of recombinant phage particles it is possible to determine the structure of selected molecules. Phage display technology continues to play an important role in HIV research. A major obstacle to the development of an effective HIV vaccine is an extensive genetic and antigenic variability of the virus. According to recent data, in order to provide protection against HIV infection, the so-called broadly neutralizing antibodies that are cross-reactive against multiple viral strains of HIV must be induced, which makes the identif ication of such antibodies a key area of HIV vaccinology. In this review, we discuss the use of phage display as a tool for identif ication of HIV-specif ic antibodies with broad neutralizing activity. We provide an outline of phage display technology, brief ly describe the design of antibody phage libraries and the affinity selection procedure, and discuss the biology of HIV-1-specif ic broadly neutralizing antibodies. Finally, we summarize the studies aimed at identif ication of broadly neutralizing antibodies using various types of phage libraries.\n## Construction of antibody phage display libraries\nThe general scheme of the method is shown in Fig. 1. \n\nThe number of panning rounds can vary depending on whether a greater variety of clones or a greater specificity of fusing to an antigen is required. Additionally, double recognition panning against two antigens can be carried out for the selection of bispecific antibodies (Hammers, Stanley, 2014). \n\nPhage display has plenty of applications: it is used for the development of antibacterial therapeutic agents (Christensen et al., 2001;Huang et al., 2012;Ashby et al., 2017), biosensors (Moon et al., 2019;Sozhamannan, Hofmann, 2020), identification of mAbs for treatment of dermatological, autoimmune diseases or cancers (Chan et al., 2014;Hammers, Stanley, 2014;Nixon et al., 2014;Alfaleh et al., 2020), as a platform for targeted drug and vaccine delivery (Clark, March, 2004;Petrenko, Jayanna, 2014;Nemudraya et al., 2016), as a tool for diagnostics and treatment of viral infections (Castel et al., 2011;Hess, Jewell, 2020). Phage display also has broad applications in the field of HIV-1 research: mapping epitopes recognized by HIV-neutralizing antibodies; searching for HIV-derived peptide mimics, which could be used a fusion inhibitors, components of vaccines Below we review some examples of identification of HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies using phage display technology.",

The biospecificity of adalimumab demonstrates a realization of the expected advantages of phage display as a drug discovery technology. Additionally, the case of adalimumab demonstrates the contribution of phage display, in conjunction with guided selection methods. Adalimumab is approved for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis and plaque psoriasis. 25 According to the boxed warning in the US prescriber information, adalimumab is associated with a risk of serious infections and malignancy. 25 dalimumab was discovered using phage display with a \"guided selection\" method involving a mouse mAb. Briefly, the heavy chain of a murine antibody able to bind to TNF was combined with a collection of human light chains and selected for binding to hTNF. The selected light chains were then combined with a collection of human heavy chains and further selected for binding to hTNF and to an N-terminal peptide of hTNF. 26 In this strategy, a library of candidates is applied to immobilized antigen in the presence of a competitor that binds at the active site of interest.",

Ladner\n## Abstract\nPhage display, one of today\u2019s fundamental drug discovery technologies, allows identification of a broad range of biological drugs, including peptides, antibodies and other proteins, with the ability to tailor critical characteristics such as potency, specificity and cross-species binding. Further, unlike in vivo technologies, generating phage display-derived antibodies is not restricted by immunological tolerance. Although more than 20 phage display-derived antibody and peptides are currently in late-stage clinical trials or approved, there is little literature addressing the specific challenges and successes in the clinical development of phage-derived drugs. This review uses case studies, from candidate identification through clinical development, to illustrate the utility of phage display as a drug discovery tool, and offers a perspective for future developments of phage display technology.\n## Introduction to Phage Display\nOnce display of a parent protein has been demonstrated, it is possible to build display libraries of 10 6 -10 11 variants from which variants having a desired binding property can be selected. In contrast, other screening methods such as chemical library or cell based screening allow testing of hundreds or thousands of synthetic compounds, or tens of thousands of plated colonies. In fact, 10 10 variants in a phage display library is actually a small part of the available theoretical sequence space. That is, the first set of binders to an antigen of interest can be subsequently diversified, retaining the sequence features that initially caused binding. This iterative variegation was used successfully to create high-affinity protease inhibitors of human plasmin, plasma kallikrein and thrombin, and it has become a common strategy in affinity maturation of drug candidates identified by phage display. 4,5 hage display was first described in 1985 and used to display short peptide fragments, 6 and the first patent was filed in 1991 (US5223409). 7 Since then, phage display has proven to be a reliable method for the generation of peptides with potential therapeutic or diagnostic utility. 8 Phage display of single-chain V-domain antibody fragments (scFv) was reported in 1990, along with selective recovery of the phage on the basis of antigen binding. 9 It has since become a major discovery platform for the identification of potent, fully human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). 10 More recently described antibody libraries have displayed Fab fragments on the phage protein, which can be readily reformatted to full-length IgG antibodies, usually without loss of binding function. 11,12 ources of diversity for phage display libraries includes immunized and na\u00efve, i.e., non-immunized, animals, as well as synthetic diversity. Use of immunized animals as a source of diversity can be attractive in that the resulting library will be biased toward the target of interest and should contain high-affinity antibodies that have been matured through the natural affinity maturation process. This approach, however, requires construction of new libraries for each new antigen and assumes that an immune response can be generated to the antigen of interest.\n\n## Case Reviews: Approved Phage-Display Derived Drugs or Those in Phase 3 Development\nIn the cases reviewed below, we highlight properties of phage display-derived candidates (Table 1) that have the potential to affect clinical success. The majority of these candidates originate from a few company-owned libraries: Cambridge Antibody Technology's (CAT, now MedImmune, subsidiary of AstraZeneca) scFv-fragment library, 13 Dyax Corp's human Fab-fragment libraries, 11,12 and MorphoSys's human combinatorial antibody scFv-fragment (HuCAL\u00ae) and Fab-fragment (HuCALGold\u00ae) libraries. 14,15 The case reviews were developed using information available in both the primary literature and patent information. \n\nAdalimumab (Humira) Adalimumab (Humira\u00ae; AbbVie Inc., formerly Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL) is a human IgG\u03ba antibody that binds tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and blocks its activation of TNF receptors. The biospecificity of adalimumab demonstrates a realization of the expected advantages of phage display as a drug discovery technology. Additionally, the case of adalimumab demonstrates the contribution of phage display, in conjunction with guided selection methods. Adalimumab is approved for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis and plaque psoriasis. 25 According to the boxed warning in the US prescriber information, adalimumab is associated with a risk of serious infections and malignancy. 25 dalimumab was discovered using phage display with a \"guided selection\" method involving a mouse mAb. Briefly, the heavy chain of a murine antibody able to bind to TNF was combined with a collection of human light chains and selected for binding to hTNF. The selected light chains were then combined with a collection of human heavy chains and further selected for binding to hTNF and to an N-terminal peptide of hTNF. 26 In this strategy, a library of candidates is applied to immobilized antigen in the presence of a competitor that binds at the active site of interest.",

                    "text": "Antibody phage display is an in vitro screening technique that allows for rapid selection of multiple monoclonal antibodies of high affinity and specificity (Hoogenboom, 2005). It involves the display of a polyclonal collection of antibody fragments containing the variable regions, numbering up to 10 11 different clones, on the surface of filamentous phage carrying the genetic sequence of the displayed fragment. Antibody library repertoires can be obtained primarily by two methods, either from cDNA antibody sequences derived from the B cells of immunized or non-immune animal or human donors, or synthetically generated using random nucleotide sequences within selected CDRs (complementarity-determining regions) in combination with one or multiple framework regions to replicate the diversity of a natural antibody repertoire (Conrad and Scheller, 2005). These sequences are then fused to the sequence encoding the gene III (gIII) coat protein of the phage, enabling expression and incorporation of the antibody fragment on its surface. This collection of phage-displayed antibodies is then panned repeatedly against the antigen of interest, producing a polyclonal phage collection enriched for antigen-specific antibodies, from which individual monoclonal clones can then be identified and characterized. \n\nThe rapidity of this technique makes it ideal for generating novel antibodies for diagnostic and potentially therapeutic responses to outbreaks of emerging infectious disease such as SARS coronavirus and H5N1 Avian Influenza or genetically modified pathogens released in a bioterrorism incident. Since antibodies are highly specific and are capable of recognizing virtually every class of pathogen, including toxins, viruses, bacteria and fungi, they enable easy and rapid identification of pathogens (Nowakowski et al., 2002;Hayhurst et al., 2003;Paoli et al., 2004;Steiniger et al., 2007;Cabezas et al., 2008). Indeed, sandwich ELISAs utilizing high affinity mouse monoclonal antibodies have been developed against likely bioterrorist threats such as epsilon toxin of Clostridium botulinum and protective antigen, a toxin component of anthrax, with demonstrated toxin detection limits of 1-2 ng/ml (el Idrissi and Ward, 1992;Mabry et al., 2006).",

Z. Chan, A. H. Chan, A. P. Lim, B. Hanson\n## Abstract\nNone\n## Introduction\nAntibody phage display is an in vitro screening technique that allows for rapid selection of multiple monoclonal antibodies of high affinity and specificity (Hoogenboom, 2005). It involves the display of a polyclonal collection of antibody fragments containing the variable regions, numbering up to 10 11 different clones, on the surface of filamentous phage carrying the genetic sequence of the displayed fragment. Antibody library repertoires can be obtained primarily by two methods, either from cDNA antibody sequences derived from the B cells of immunized or non-immune animal or human donors, or synthetically generated using random nucleotide sequences within selected CDRs (complementarity-determining regions) in combination with one or multiple framework regions to replicate the diversity of a natural antibody repertoire (Conrad and Scheller, 2005). These sequences are then fused to the sequence encoding the gene III (gIII) coat protein of the phage, enabling expression and incorporation of the antibody fragment on its surface. This collection of phage-displayed antibodies is then panned repeatedly against the antigen of interest, producing a polyclonal phage collection enriched for antigen-specific antibodies, from which individual monoclonal clones can then be identified and characterized. \n\nThe rapidity of this technique makes it ideal for generating novel antibodies for diagnostic and potentially therapeutic responses to outbreaks of emerging infectious disease such as SARS coronavirus and H5N1 Avian Influenza or genetically modified pathogens released in a bioterrorism incident. Since antibodies are highly specific and are capable of recognizing virtually every class of pathogen, including toxins, viruses, bacteria and fungi, they enable easy and rapid identification of pathogens (Nowakowski et al., 2002;Hayhurst et al., 2003;Paoli et al., 2004;Steiniger et al., 2007;Cabezas et al., 2008). Indeed, sandwich ELISAs utilizing high affinity mouse monoclonal antibodies have been developed against likely bioterrorist threats such as epsilon toxin of Clostridium botulinum and protective antigen, a toxin component of anthrax, with demonstrated toxin detection limits of 1-2 ng/ml (el Idrissi and Ward, 1992;Mabry et al., 2006).",

Such properties, collectively called developability [18,19], include (but are not limited to) cross-reactivity against the human target and orthologs from relevant tox species and animal models, solubility, expression yield in manufacturing cells, and thermal and long-term stability. Since these properties are encoded in the amino acid sequence of the antibody, there has been a strong demand to generate phage display antibody libraries that not only enable the selection of highly specific and high affinity antibodies, but also those that are more developable. \n\nAs a result, numerous phage display antibody libraries have been built after the seminal work by John McCafferty and Gregory Winter in 1990 [6]. These libraries, their construction process, validation with diverse targets, and applications of the selected antibodies to diagnostic and/or therapeutic settings have been extensively reviewed in the literature [20][21][22][23][24][25]. Here, given the vast amount of information pertaining to phage display, compounded with space limitations, we review nine phage display scFv and Fab libraries published in the last decade (Table 1). These nine libraries are the latest generation of phage display antibody libraries and represent the state-of-the-art platforms for human therapeutic antibody discovery. We first discuss the functionality of the libraries in terms of size, quality, and diversity of the antibody repertoires. Second, we review and compare the outcome of the selection processes, i.e., the number of positive clones, hit rate, and affinity of the selected antibodies. Third, we discuss the performance of the libraries in terms of the developability of the selected antibodies. Finally, we highlight current opportunities and challenges relating to phage display platforms and other display technologies.",

            "text": "Phages are the most abundant organisms on the earth and have a great impact on the earth's ecosystems. Some phages have also been engineered into good expression vectors for coupling genotypes and phenotypes, which can be utilized to harness the power of evolution by artificial selection. Phage display is a powerful and versatile technology for constructing a library of peptides or antibodies displayed on phage virions, and then screening them for peptides or antibodies with desired properties. In 2018, one-half of the Nobel Prize in chemistry was awarded jointly to George P. Smith and Sir Gregory P. Winter for the \"phage display of peptides and antibodies\" (Smith, 2019;Winter, 2019). Phage display has been widely used to map epitopes, identify drug targets (Takakusagi et al., 2020), and develop therapeutics, diagnostics, and vaccines. \n\nIn the present Research Topic, we have organized 11 articles, including seven original research papers, two method papers, and two reviews, to share the authors' understanding of the phage display technique and its applications from various angles. \n\nNext-generation sequencing (NGS) has been employed in most, if not all, fields of biology and medicine. Phage display is no exception, either for antibodies or peptides. Using the Roche 454 NGS platform, Lisowska et al. identified over 13,000 peptides targeting ubiquitin and over 10,000 peptides against ubiquitin-like modifier NEDD8 from the Ph.D.-12 Phage Display Peptide Library. Two peptides were further confirmed to inhibit both E3 ubiquitin ligases, MDM2 and CHIP, and their binding modes were solved by the NMR analysis. Zhao et al. made a phage panning scheme that separately covered selections against phosphotyrosine (pTyr) and sulfated tyrosine (sTyr) peptides, followed by NGS. After mining the NGS data and validating with experiments, they successfully identified some sTyr superbinders. Maruthachalam et al. designed three synthetic Fab libraries based on a modified trastuzumab framework.",

            "text": "Antibody phage display is a versatile, reproducible, and functional technology that can be utilized to isolate antibody candidates for numerous disease indications. While it is the most common and well-established form of display technologies, the success of isolating useful antibodies is highly dependent on the quality and the nature of the targeted antigen used in biopanning and the size and quality of the library. By performing cell-based biopanning, antibody phage display can be used to identify new cell biomarkers, isolate antibodies that can discriminate between different antigen epitopes and conformations, or identify antibodies against antigens that are not available in pure form (74). \n\nPhage display technology has been proven to be a powerful human mAb discovery platform. Not long ago the commercial use of phage display was restricted to a few selected biopharmaceutical companies with rights to phage display intellectual property (569). This explains why most of the approved mAbs or those in clinical trials sourced from phage display libraries belong to commercial entities with rights to the technology. However, most of the key patents covering phage display technology have expired in Europe and the US (569). Consequently, patent expiration should encourage academic and biotech start-ups to develop their own libraries to generate and develop more antibodies for translation to the clinic. \n\nBy reflecting on the collected data, antibody phage display has contributed to the isolation of antibodies for the treatment of many disease indications. There are 14 FDA approved phage display-derived antibodies and antibody fragments, and many others in clinical trials. Many research institutes, start-ups and industrial laboratories are continually developing methods for the design, construction and screening of developable antibodyphage libraries. Further improvements are expected to be achieved in the near future as this technology contributes significantly toward research, diagnosis, and therapy.",

            "text": "ABSTRACT Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and their derivatives have emerged as one of the most important classes of biotherapeutics in recent decades. The success of mAb is due to their high versatility, high target specificity, excellent clinical safety profile, and efficacy. Antibody discovery, the most upstream stage of the antibody development pipeline, plays a pivotal role in determination of the clinical outcome of an mAb product. Phage display technology, originally developed for peptide directed evolution, has been extensively applied to discovery of fully human antibodies due to its unprecedented advantages. The value of phage display technology has been proven by a number of approved mAbs, including several top-selling mAb drugs, derived from the technology. Since antibody phage display was first established over 30\u2009years ago, phage display platforms have been developed to generate mAbs targeting difficult-to-target antigens and tackle the drawbacks present in in vivo antibody discovery approaches. More recently, the new generation of phage display libraries have been optimized for discovery of mAbs with \u201ddrug-like\u201d properties. This review will summarize the principles of antibody phage display and design of three generations of antibody phage display libraries.",

Smith and Sir Gregory P. Winter for the phage display of peptides and antibodies, respectively. In addition, phage display has been shown to synergize with other display technologies, such as ribosome display and yeast display, which can be implemented for optimization of the protein's drug-like properties and affinity maturation [21,22], as well other technologies such as next-generation sequencing (NGS), flow cytometry, and microfluidics to enhance throughput. The implementation of phage display has revolutionized therapeutic antibody discovery and development, initiating the establishment of multiple biotechnology companies where this was the core technology for generating human antibodies, for example, Cambridge Antibody Technology [16], Dyax Corporation [23], and MorphoSys [24]. \n\nThere are at least 19 approved mAbs and nanobody-based entities that have been derived from the application of phage display as summarized in Table 1. Other examples of current phage-derived antibodies that have attained late stage clinical development are shown in Table 2 and include bimagrumab, which reached Phase 3 for the treatment of sporadic inclusion body myositis, but was subsequently discontinued for this indication for unspecified reasons, and is still active in Phase 2 for the treatment of obesity (targeting Activin Receptor Type 2B), utomilumab in Phase 2 for the treatment of breast cancer (targeting CD137, also known as 4-1BB), mavrilimumab in Phase 3 for the treatment of inflammation (targeting GM-CSFR\u03b1), and otilimab in Phase 3 studies evaluating clinical efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19 and COVID-19-related pneumonia (targeting GM-CSF).

The in vivo production of antibodies by B-cells involves a series of intricate gene editing processes resulting in a highly diverse pool of antibodies. However, this diversity can be replicated in vitro using phage display. Phage display offers the potential to present the antibody phenotype together with the cloned genotype of the specific antibody in a single-phage particle. Antibodies are highly sought after for diagnostic applications owing to its specificity and affinity towards a target antigen. The advent of recombinant antibody (rAb) technology allows for a faster and more costeffective solution for antibody generation. It also provides diagnostic developers with the possibility to customize the antibodies. Antibodies have been utilized successfully in various diagnostic platforms ranging from standard immunoassays to lateral-flow assays, nanoparticles, microfluidics, DNA\u2010integrated assays and others. The limitless application of antibodies in the field of diagnostics has made it a critical component in any diagnostic development platform. This chapter focuses on the processes involved in antibody discovery including the various forms of antibody libraries for phage display and panning processes.

            "text": "ABSTRACT Over the last 3 decades, monoclonal antibodies have become the most important class of therapeutic biologicals on the market. Development of therapeutic antibodies was accelerated by recombinant DNA technologies, which allowed the humanization of murine monoclonal antibodies to make them more similar to those of the human body and suitable for a broad range of chronic diseases like cancer and autoimmune diseases. In the early 1990s in vitro antibody selection technologies were developed that enabled the discovery of \u201cfully\u201d human antibodies with potentially superior clinical efficacy and lowest immunogenicity. Antibody phage display is the first and most widely used of the in vitro selection technologies. It has proven to be a robust, versatile platform technology for the discovery of human antibodies and a powerful engineering tool to improve antibody properties. As of the beginning of 2016, 6 human antibodies discovered or further developed by phage display were approved for therapy. In 2002, adalimumab (Humira\u00ae) became the first phage display-derived antibody granted a marketing approval. Humira\u00ae was also the first approved human antibody, and it is currently the best-selling antibody drug on the market. Numerous phage display-derived antibodies are currently under advanced clinical investigation, and, despite the availability of other technologies such as human antibody-producing transgenic mice, phage display has not lost its importance for the discovery and engineering of therapeutic antibodies. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview about phage display-derived antibodies that are approved for therapy or in clinical development. A selection of these antibodies is described in more detail to demonstrate different aspects of the phage display technology and its development over the last 25 years.",

            "text": "generation. This brought about various methods including phage display and other multiple display methods such as yeast display, ribosome display and mammalian cell display methods [14]. In addition, the use of transgenic animals was also introduced mainly with the xeno-mouse technology [11,13,14]. Even so, phage display is the preferred choice for recombinant antibody (rAb) production in most laboratories. Phage display allows for a faster and cost-effective solution towards antibody generation using Ff filamentous phage. In general, rAb production involves several steps including the generation of an antibody library, selection and enrichment of phage-displaying antibodies against specific antigens through the panning process, screening of monospecific antibodies and recombinant production of the antibodies via expression systems [15]. As phage-derived rAb may suffer from lower affinities, an additional stage of affinity maturation may be introduced to improve the antibodies produced. A major advantage to the use of phage display for rAb generation in contrast to conventional animal-derived methods is clearly the omission of animal use in the process. Another advantage of phage display is the lower downtime required for antibody production in between antigens. Conventional methods require immunization that may take up to weeks if not months to yield sufficient immune response for antibody production. This makes phage display rather efficient in the long term for antibody production process. However, one must acknowledge that phage-derived antibodies suffer from lower affinity when compared to conventional antibodies. This is due to the absence of affinity maturation in phage-derived antibodies as animal-derived antibodies are produced post maturation.\n\nThis chapter highlights monoclonal antibody development for diagnostic applications via phage display technology. This includes the different types of antibody libraries associated with antibody phage display. The chapter also highlights the different methods used to isolate antibodies against target antigens.

More recently, there is a strong trend for the use of phage display in medical science with the production of humanized antibodies and development of new therapeutics. Indeed, a few selected peptides and proteins are in clinical or preclinical stages of development and some are reaching the market (Rothe et al., 2006).",

            "text": "Antibodies are essential molecules for diagnosis and treatment of diseases caused by pathogens and their toxins. Antibodies were integrated in our medical repertoire against infectious diseases more than hundred years ago by using animal sera to treat tetanus and diphtheria. In these days, most developed therapeutic antibodies target cancer or autoimmune diseases. The COVID-19 pandemic was a reminder about the importance of antibodies for therapy against infectious diseases. While monoclonal antibodies could be generated by hybridoma technology since the 70ies of the former century, nowadays antibody phage display, among other display technologies, is robustly established to discover new human monoclonal antibodies. Phage display is an in vitro technology which confers the potential for generating antibodies from universal libraries against any conceivable molecule of sufficient size and omits the limitations of the immune systems. If convalescent patients or immunized/infected animals are available, it is possible to construct immune phage display libraries to select in vivo affinity-matured antibodies. A further advantage is the availability of the DNA sequence encoding the phage displayed antibody fragment, which is packaged in the phage particles. Therefore, the selected antibody fragments can be rapidly further engineered in any needed antibody format according to the requirements of the final application. In this review, we present an overview of phage display derived recombinant antibodies against bacterial, viral and eukaryotic pathogens, as well as microbial toxins, intended for diagnostic and therapeutic applications.",

            "text": "The large number of phage display-derived antibodies in clinical development demonstrates the value of this in vitro selection technology for the discovery of therapeutic antibodies. Phage display has not only proven to be a versatile and reliable platform technology for the discovery of \"fully\" human antibodies for over 2 decades, but it has been successfully used for the development of other types of peptide and protein therapeutics, such as ecallantide (Kalbitor \u00d2 , Dyax/Shire), 122 Xyntha purification peptide 204 and the peptibody trebananib (AMG-386, Amgen) 205 (for review see Nixon et al. 86 ).\n\nThe changing intellectual property landscape will further affect development. For many years access to antibody phage display was controlled by a few companies, based on their technology patents. But these, namely the Breitling/D\u20ac ubel (EP0440147) and McCafferty/Winter (EP0774511, EP0589877) families, expired in 2011 in Europe. In the US the patent US5969108 (filed 1990, granted 1991, published 1999), US6172197 (filed 1991, granted 1995, published 2001) and US6806079 (filed 1990, granted 2000, published 2004) are most relevant. The expiration of US patents is more complex and depends on variables such as the filling date, the grant date, patent term adjustments and extensions. Together with lower pricing driven by the competition with biosimilar products, the patent expiry should spur innovation and allow more companies to advance human antibodies made by phage display into the clinic.\n\nAntibody phage display has advantages over newer technologies like yeast or mammalian cell display, including library size (>10 10 ), robust and well-established E. coli expression system, scalability, short panning cycles and cost-efficiency, but also in vitro selection conditions and the ability to pan on antigen-expressing cells. Issues with E. coli expression and phage display of full size IgGs can be addressed with efficient expression platforms and screening technologies. 206 The power of phage display lies in the choice of the optimal in vitro selection conditions, which allows pre-definition of many biophysical and biochemical antibody properties at a very early step of the discovery process",

            "text": "Medical manifestations of disease, confirmed by biochemical, microbiological, and animal tests, remain the gold standard in clinical diagnostic laboratories. Currently, new requirements for fast, sensitive, accurate, and inexpensive detection platforms devalue the traditional detection methods. Modern immunoassays and biosensors require a biorecognition probe, which is attached to the interface of the analytical device, binding the target biological or chemical threat agent and generating a measurable signal. Most analytic platforms rely on the use of monoclonal antibodies as biorecognition probes. However, their broad application is limited by high cost, low specificity, less-than-optimal affinity, and sensitivity to environmental stresses. Landscape-phage display is a novel concept that allows for the development of diagnostic and detection interfaces that meet modern criteria for biological detection and monitoring [20,21,49,52,57]. It was proved that the landscape libraries represent an inexhaustible rich source of substitute antibodies-filaments that bind protein and glycoprotein antigens with nanomolar affinities and high specificity [49]. Landscape-phage-based interfaces performed in many ways much more effectively than their natural immunoglobulin counterparts in the same detector platforms. Target-specific landscape-phage probes can be prepared as described in commonly available protocols [58,59]. In my laboratory, Bacillus anthracis spore-specific landscape phages were selected by incubation of the landscape-phage library with spores immobilized in wells of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plates. Non-related phage particles were discarded, and spore-bound particles were released with acid buffer and collected [60]. To discover phage probes against the bacteria Salmonella typhimurium, a similar panning procedure was used, along with a coprecipitation procedure, in which complexes of bacterial cells and phage particles were isolated by centrifugation [61]. After titering of the phage in the host E. coli strain, random phage clones were used for the identification of selected displayed peptides by sequencing of recombinant gpVIII DNA [61].",

This robust and versatile technology allows the expression of an antibody fused to a phage coat protein on the surface of a filamentous phage. The DNA sequence coding for the antibody is packaged within the phage, linking the phenotype to genotype. Antibody phage display inherits the ability to rapidly generate and modify or improve high-affinity monoclonal antibodies, rendering it indispensable in immunology. In the last two decades, phage-display-derived antibodies have been extensively used in human medicine as diagnostic and therapeutic modalities. Recently, they are also gaining significant ground in veterinary medicine. Even though these advancements are mainly biased towards economically important animals such as chicken, cattle, and pigs, they are laying the foundation of fulfilling the unmet needs of veterinary medicine as antibody-based biologics in viral diagnostics, therapeutics, and immunoprophylaxis. This review provides a brief overview of the construction of antibody phage libraries and their application in diagnosis, prevention, and control of infectious viral diseases in veterinary medicine in detail.",

As shown in Table 1, over 40 biological drugs or drug candidates were discovered using phage display. Five are approved drugs (4 antibodies and 1 peptide), and an additional 3 antibody-based candidates (trebananib, ramucirumab and necitumumab) are in Phase 3 development for the treatment of various cancers. Of these, completion of Phase 3 studies (either primary or estimated study completion) of both ramucirumab (NCT01170663, NCT00917384, NCT00703326) and necitumumab (NCT00981058, NCT00982111) are estimated for 2013. \n\nMost of the phage display candidates in Table 1 are antibodies or antibody derivatives, with ecallantide (Kalbitor\u00ae), Xyntha purification peptide, and the peptibody trebananib (AMG-386) being the exceptions. While peptide-based therapeutics are clinically promising due to their small size and established manufacturing processes, their short half-life initially limited their potential as therapeutic strategies. Advances in protein engineering such as peptide cyclization, use of fusion proteins (e.g., the Fc fragment), unnatural amino acids and conjugation to polyethylene glycol and polysialic acids have mitigated some of these limitations. 83 As a consequence, there has been a recent re-emergence of peptidebased therapeutics development. 8 With the power and versatility of phage display, it is likely that phage display will continue to provide candidate peptides for therapeutic or diagnostic applications. 84,85 necdotal evidence has been used to support the hypothesis that a higher percentage of mAbs selected from synthetic or semisynthetic phage libraries have lower solubility profiles compared with murine hybridoma antibodies. 86 However, this phenomenon, if true, is easily overcome by employing a variety of techniques. Screening library outputs using a combination of cross interaction chromatography and dynamic light scattering have proven effective as early solubility screening techniques. 87",

            "text": "Eight chapters in this book review or report recent applications and technological innovations involving Ff phage of E. coli, or derived particles. Phage display is the most prominent application of filamentous phage. It was developed on the shoulders of versatile cloning vectors derived from the E. coli Ff (F-pilus specific) filamentous phage (f1, fd, and M13), and knowledge about their life cycle. Combinatorial technologies including Ff phage display are based on a physical link of coding sequence to encoded protein displayed on the virus particle. Screening vast Ff display libraries for variants that bind a \"bait\" of interest has resulted over the past 25 years in identification of bioactive peptides or therapeutic recombinant antibodies. Two chapters, by Gagic et al. and Henry et al., review, respectively, phage display applications for discovery of microbial surface proteins (including vaccine targets) and non-traditional applications of phage particles as therapeutic biologics, vaccines carriers, or bioconjugation scaffolds. \n\nA technology report (Tjhung et al.) addresses an issue that has plagued phage display libraries of proteins and peptides fused to the N-terminus of virion protein pIII, in that some peptide variants are more likely to be degraded than others. Recombinant phage encoding these degradable variants have advantage at amplification step over other library clones, due to more efficient pIII-mediated infection of the host, and may outcompete the true binders in the library screens. The authors demonstrate that this can be prevented by displaying peptides between the pIII N1 and N2 domains instead of display at the N-terminus. Given that N1 domain is essential for infection, amplification of recombinant phage clones depends on preservation of displayed peptide (and thereby retention of the N1 domain in the phage). This strategy eliminates those recombinant clones in the library whose displayed peptides are degraded. It is very likely that phage display between N1 and N2 domains of pIII will be taken up by many researchers in the future. \n\nTwo research reports describe novel applications of Ff-phagederived particles in tumor targeting.",

Both mAbs were generated by phage display from B cells of an influenza vaccinated individual [150] and from a \"nonimmune\" human antibody library [151]. Contrary to the disadvantages listed for phage display libraries, these are high affinity mAbs, in the range of nanomolar and picomolar, respectively. \n\nGeneration of mAbs by phage display technology was a breakthrough since this technology opened possibilities to isolate human antibodies for any kind of epitope/antigen without immunization. The success of this technology can be observed by the approval of some drugs, mAbs and other kinds of proteins, and many more are under clinical studies at different stages. There are some candidates for Phase 3 clinical trial, bringing promises of new drugs in the near future [25,134]. As a perspective for infectious diseases, this technology should be more widely applied for rapid screening of antibodies for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes based on immune or na\u00efve human libraries when epidemic infectious disease breaks without an available drug for its treatment. Other perspective concerns the combinatorial library construction. Recently, the human antibody repertoire derived from blood of human na\u00efve or immunized donors has been intensively analyzed by next-generation sequencing [152,153]. Advances in the knowledge of the human antibody repertoire would help in the designing of antibody libraries and for antibody maturation of existing human libraries, making possible the selection of mAbs with higher affinity for clinical use.",

These antibodies are mainly derived from two types of sources: immune, or na\u00efve libraries. Immune libraries should be preferred when immunized animals or convalescent patients are available, offering the chance to directly isolate affinity matured antibodies. If immunization is not possible or ethically not feasible, na\u00efve antibody gene libraries are an alternative. In such an approach, the antibody generation process is not limited by the immune system. Using antibody phage display a variety of recombinant antibodies was generated for diagnostics and therapy against bacterial, viral pathogens, and eukaryotic pathogens as well as toxins. \n\nWe acknowledge funding from the European Community's Seventh Framework Program (FP7/2007-2013) under agreement no. 241832 granted to the AntiBotABE project (http://www.antibotabe.com), funding from Federal State of Lower Saxony, Nieders\u00e4chsisches Vorab (VWZN2889), and APTDETECT (Eurostars).

            "text": "Originally driven by the study of ligand-receptor interactions, phage display has evolved into a versatile platform encompassing a range of diagnostic methodologies. This technology has enabled the development of phage ELISA for antibody detection, biosensors for rapid pathogen identification, and peptide arrays for comprehensive biomarker screening [180]. The inherent signal amplification capacity of phages enhances their in situ detection and facilitates the identification of disease-specific bacterial markers. Moreover, phage-derived proteins hold promise for imaging and targeted drug delivery, thus advancing diagnostics and personalized medicine [181]. This adaptable tool fuels innovative strategies for disease detection and the exploration of biomarkers. Once engineered, these modified phages are useful in diverse diagnostic applications, offering sensitive and precise detection of disease-related entities in clinical samples, ranging from minute targets such as viruses to substantial entities such as cancer cells (Table 1) [182][183][184][185][186]. \n\nAnand et al. comprehensively outlined the application of phage displays for diagnosing coronaviruses [187]. Phage engineering has facilitated novel target exploration through epitope mapping, shedding light on interactions between coronaviruses, human cell receptors, and other molecules. Li et al. developed a method for detecting virus particles at levels lower than the minimum infective dose, such as 10 5 copies/mL [188]. Similarly, Soendergaard et al. identified an optimal peptide for ovarian cancer diagnosis, enabling the direct application of radioactive indium ( 111 In) labeling for conventional SPECT/CT instrumentation [189]. The use of M13 phages as detection probes provides an additional diagnostic avenue. Ferreira et al. employed an M13 phage display platform to visualize colorectal cancer cells via specific MCT1 marker binding [190]. Lee et al. encoded a lungcancer-targeting peptide, Pep-1, on M13 phages, enabling non-invasive live in vivo imaging with a near-infrared microscope [191]. Salles et al. ingeniously mimicked a Leishmania infantum epitope using an M13 phage display, achieving 100% specificity and sensitivity for diagnosing human visceral leishmaniasis [192].",

A conclusion regarding the validity of the above-mentioned credo is thus difficult to draw with the limited amount of data available today. A recent review by Getts et al., discusses in depth this trend towards human antibodies with respect to immunogenicity and safety aspects [4]. \n\nIn order to characterize a given antibody library, three main aspects have to be considered: the display method, the antibody fragment used as scaffold and the source of the sequence diversity. This review gives an introduction into the field with a focus on antibody-based phage display libraries for the generation of therapeutic antibodies, many of them developed in an industrial setting. To put everything into context, it will briefly describe the display methods used most frequently and touch on different antibody formats currently in use for display and selection.",

            "text": "For instance, Abicipar pegol, an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibody fragment, has been approved for the treatment of neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration. Belimumab (Benlysta), targeting the soluble B lymphocyte stimulator, which is involved in the survival and activation of B cells, is employed to reduce disease activity in systemic lupus erythematosus patients [37]. \n\nThe process of constructing these engineered antibodies follows a similar procedure. Initially, a phage library is generated by cloning a diverse array of antibody variable region sequences into a phage display vector. This library encompasses a broad spectrum of antibody fragments, each showcased on the surface of individual phage particles. Through multiple rounds of biopanning, phages displaying antibodies that specifically bind to the target antigen are selected from the library. These chosen phages are subsequently amplified and propagated to enrich for high-affinity binders. Finally, the DNA sequences encoding the variable regions of the selected antibodies are isolated and inserted into expression vectors for the production of full-length antibodies. Atezolizumab, for instance, was discovered through screening a human phage display library against a recombinant extracellular domain-Fc fusion of human PD-L1. From this screening, a high-affinity antibody was isolated from a single phage clone, utilizing a human IgG1 backbone. Due to PD-L1 expression on activated T cells, the Fc region of atezolizumab underwent engineering to abolish the antibody-dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC) effect. This engineering involved introducing an Asn to Ala substitution at position 298 within the CH2 domain of each heavy chain. As a result, atezolizumab was rendered incapable of binding to human Fc\u03b3 receptors. \n\nComparing the use of a phage-derived monoclonal antibody (mAb) to the original mAb in cancer treatment reveals several advantages of phage display-derived antibodies. Firstly, phage display allows for the generation of antibodies with enhanced specificity and affinity through iterative rounds of selection and optimization. This enables the identification of antibodies with superior binding properties compared to those obtained through traditional hybridoma-based methods [36].",

            "text": "The importance of phage display platforms was recognized with the awarding of the Nobel Prize to George P. Smith and Sir Gregory P. Winter for the 'phage display of peptides and antibodies' in 2018. Phage display libraries are widely used to identify novel antigen-specific monoclonal antibodies and map the binding sites or epitopes of proteins or antibodies. Phage display technology has also emerged as a robust platform for drug discovery in biotechnology due to its ability to facilitate the efficient identification of antibodies in vitro (Nagano and Tsutsumi, 2021). This technology facilitates extensive applications in biomedical research, drug development, and bioengineering (Kim et al., 2011). \n\nOne key advancement that has greatly improved the efficiency and scalability of phage display technology is Oligonucleotide Library Synthesis (OLS). OLS allows for the high-throughput synthesis of numerous oligonucleotide sequences, which can then be used to create highly diverse peptide libraries. Phage Immunoprecipitation Sequencing (PhIP-Seq) is a technique derived from traditional phage display that utilizes OLS to encode peptide libraries. PhIP-Seq enables the efficient detection of antibodies on a large scale by employing a high-capacity phage display peptide library, antibody immunoprecipitation, and highthroughput sequencing (Mohan et al., 2018). This technique can detect antibodies against hundreds of thousands of peptides and provide a comprehensive mapping of antibody profiles, making it particularly advantageous in studying complex diseases or immune responses to large pathogen families. Moreover, its high multiplexing capability allows for the analysis of multiple samples simultaneously, significantly reducing the cost of DNA sequencing per sample and enabling the analysis of large sets of samples. With these aforementioned characteristics, PhIP-Seq facilitates the discovery of novel antibodies and enhances our understanding of the immune response. \n\nAs shown in Figure 1, In this review, we highlight the research progress of PhIP-Seq technology, encompassing the entire process from the library's design to the data analysis. We have also summarized current challenges and potential solutions for them. Furthermore, we explore prospective directions for future development in PhIP-Seq technology and its applications.",

            "text": "Phage display has become the most frequently used display technology, with the advantage of robustness due to high stability of the phage (Hoet et al., 2005). The in vitro methods employ a na\u00efve antibody library generated from donor-derived B cells, a synthetic library from synthetically derived diversity, or a semi-synthetic library derived from a combination of these two approaches, which differ in framework region (FR) composition and CDR diversification (Glanville et al., 2009;Hoogenboom, 2005;Kugler et al., 2015;Lloyd et al., 2009;Tiller et al., 2013;Zhai et al., 2011). The most commonly used antibody formats for phage display are single-chain Fv (scFv) and Fab. ScFv fragments are moderately stable on average and often have a high tendency to form multimers as well as aggregates, whereas Fab fragments have been found to possess comparably higher structural stability by an additional interface of the constant domains (Rothlisberger et al., 2005). For these reasons, Fab has replaced the scFv as a display format in many of recent phage libraries (Ponsel et al., 2011). \n\nIn this study, we constructed a large na\u00efve human Fab library (3 \uf0b4 10 10 colonies) from the peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs), lymph node, spleen, and bone marrow of 809 human donors and assessed available diversities of the VH and \u03ba VL (VK) repertoires in the entire library by 454 pyrosequencing. In addition, we validated the antibody library by selecting specific Fabs against 10 different therapeutically relevant antigens by phage display. The antibody library will be useful in the generation of human mAbs against diverse antigens, and the information about the diversity of natural antibody repertoires will be valuable in the future design of synthetic human antibody libraries with high functional diversity.",

This review uses case studies, from candidate identification through clinical development, to illustrate the utility of phage display as a drug discovery tool, and offers a perspective for future developments of phage display technology.",

Disease-specific antibodies can be important serum biomarkers, but the identification of antigens associated with specific immune reactions is challenging, in particular if complex communities of microorganisms are involved in the disease progression. Despite promising new diagnostic opportunities, the discovery of these serological markers becomes more difficult with increasing complexity of microbial communities. In the present work, we used a metagenomic M13 phage display approach to select immunogenic oligopeptides from the gut microbiome of transgenic mice suffering from chronic ileitis. We constructed three individual metaproteome phage display libraries with a library size of approximately 107 clones each. Using serum antibodies, we selected and validated three oligopeptides that induced specific antibody responses in the mouse model. This proof-of-concept study provides the first successful application of functional metaproteome display for the study of protein-protein interactions and the discovery of potential disease biomarkers.",

            "text": "The main struggle in traditional methods is the development of fully human mAbs to apply in therapeutics and consequently, several efforts have been endeavored to overcome this problem. The debut of recombinant DNA technology together with progress of in vitro technologies provided several new and powerful ways that lead to the development of the phage display technology to create therapeutic antibodies. This ground breaking technology was introduced in 1985 by Smith [107] centered on the selection of a particular phenotype (e.g., a ligand specific to a target antigen) from repertoires of molecules displayed on phages. In 1990, McCafferty and colleagues demonstrated that the display of antibody fragments on phages was conceivable through the use of vectors to introduce antibody DNA into phage genomes, thus combining genotype and phenotype in one phage particle [117,124]. The concept behind this display technology is that a large library of potentially interesting antibodies is created, from which antibody fragments with desirable specificity and affinity can be selected against a specific antigen [125]. The use of phage libraries carrying human Ig genes-antibody display libraries was one of the most successful applications of this approach [125].\n\nFor the construction of an antibody library, the repertoire of V-genes encoding antibodies from B cells is amplified via PCR using a set of specific primers covering all the V gene families. Subsequently the antibody fragments are generated by random combination of VL and VH chain genes [126,127]. Based on the origin of antibody genes, the libraries can be categorized into natural or synthetic. Furthermore, natural source repertoire libraries can be either naive or immune. Naive libraries are derived from non-immunized donors of B cells, and immune libraries are derived from different kinds of immunized animals, human patients with a certain disease or previously exposed [75]. Additionally, several formats of antibody fragments, most commonly Fab and scFv can be cloned and displayed on phage libraries [128]. Once created the repertoire of antibody fragments, this heterogeneous mixture of phage clones is then screened by an affinity selection process called panning, during which the phage populations are presented to specific targets in order to select specific target-binding phages ( Figure 6). The antigen of interest is immobilized on a solid support and",

            "text": "The discovery of phages has aroused the attention of scientists at the beginning of the last century, and initially phages were useful for infecting specific bacteria or viruses. \n\nAs technology developed, phages were thought to carry some types of genetic material and became an important part of the field of genetics (Bertani & Weigle, 1953). In 1985, Smith (1985) inserted foreign genes into phages, displayed the foreign genes on phage coat proteins, and used phage display technology to construct single chain antibody libraries that could be screened for sequences expressing a specific scFv. Phages were stable under external factors (e.g., pH, temperature). Phage coat proteins can be modified to display foreign genes as fusion proteins without losing the infectivity of the phage. With the progress of technology, phage display technology has been matured, and phage peptide libraries, phage single chain antibody libraries and phage synthesis libraries can be established by phage display technology (Sunderland, Yang & Mao, 2017). Phage display can be used for the analysis of protein interactions as well as the screening of proteins or the selection of antibodies for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, mimicking natural antibody libraries through billions of phage particles presenting different antibodies. \n\nThe origin of the phage antibody libraries significantly affected on the species of phage antibody libraries. In general, the more diverse the sources, the greater the capacity of the phage antibody libraries (Frenzel, Schirrmann & Hust, 2016;Beerli & Rader, 2010). The main benefit of using phage display to obtain antibodies was that it was fast and did not need immunization of animals and humans. However, phage display systems included the T4, T7, \u03bb and M13 phage display systems (The differences between them were shown in Table 1). Among them, M13 phage was the most common phage in the construction of phage display single chain antibody libraries.",

            "text": "After the introduction of target-based drug discovery approaches, time consuming trial-and-error processes were replaced with high throughput library screenings to identify highly specific drug molecules [33]. Due to its simplicity, cost effectiveness, and speed, phage display has been one of the most widely used screening methods and has led to small peptide and antibody drugs discovery [34]. The technology involves the fusion of peptides/proteins into the genome of bacteriophages (phages) to be expressed on the phage surface as fusions to the coat proteins [35,36]. The physical link between the displayed peptides/proteins and their encoded DNA sequence enables identification of high-affinity binders through DNA sequencing after the phage display combinatorial library screening against the target of interest [37][38][39]. After the first description of phage display peptide libraries in 1985 by George Smith [40], the technique was used for the construction of antibody libraries by Gregory Winter and his colleagues, who pioneered the development of antibody drugs by phage display technology [41,42]. Phage display technology as well as the different phage display platforms used in drug discovery have been reviewed elsewhere and will not be further discussed herein [43][44][45]. In this review, we summarize the most common protein scaffolds used in construction of phage display libraries and their current applications in antiviral discovery.

Recent advances in the production of highly diverse and functional antibody libraries are considered here, including for Fabs, scFvs and nanobodies. These advances include codon optimisation during generation of CDR diversity, improved display levels using novel signal sequences, molecular chaperones and isomerases and the use of highly stable scaffolds with relatively high expression levels. In addition, novel strategies for the batch reformatting of scFv and Fab phagemid libraries, derived from phage panning, into IgG formats are described.

Affibodies, the backbone of which is based one of the IgG-binding domains of staphylococcal protein-A have been randomized to create libraries selected on such cancer epitopes as HER2 and TNF-alpha to create agents potentially useful for imaging and therapy targeting applications [136,137]. \n\nIn addition to dissection of the immune response against tumors, antibody display libraries have been recently used in a wide variety of application ranging from proteasome characterization in aging [138] to mapping immune response in infections [139,140]. Recently, an scFv phage display library was used to screen vasculature as a proof-of-concept [55]. Selection was performed on the luminal endothelial cell plasma membranes isolated from tissues and enriched in proteins exposed to the bloodstream in vivo. Homing of the selected antibodies was confirmed by wholebody imaging. \n\nDisplay technologies have accelerated the translation of antibodies into targeted therapeutics [118,121,124].

            "text": "Generation of sequence defined antibodies from universal libraries by phage display has been established over the past three decades as a robust method to cope with the increasing market demand in therapy, diagnostics and research. For applications requiring the bivalent antigen binding and an Fc part for detection, phage display generated single chain Fv (scFv) antibody fragments can rapidly be genetically fused to the Fc moiety of an IgG for the production in eukaryotic cells of antibodies with IgG-like properties. In contrast to conversion of scFv into IgG format, the conversion to scFv-Fc requires only a single cloning step, and provides significantly higher yields in transient cell culture production than IgG. ScFv-Fcs can be effective as neutralizing antibodies in vivo against a panel of pathogens and toxins. However, different scFv fragments are more heterologous in respect of stability than Fab fragments. While some scFv fragments can be made extremely stable, this may change due to few mutations, and is not predictable from the sequence of a newly selected antibody. To mitigate the necessity to assess the stability for every scFv-Fc antibody, we developed a generic lyophilization protocol to improve their shelf life. We compared long-term stability and binding activity of phage display-derived antibodies in the scFv-Fc and IgG format, either stored in liquid or lyophilized state. Conversion of scFv-Fcs into the full IgG format reduced protein degradation and aggregation, but in some cases compromised binding activity. Comparably to IgG conversion, lyophilization of scFv-Fc resulted in the preservation of the antibodies\u2019 initial properties after storage, without any drop in affinity for any of the tested antibody clones.",

            "text": "Consequently, a majority of the antibodies developed today are owned by these companies with proprietary access to the underlying technologies. While many patents have expired in Europe and the United States, there is a notable opportunity for academic groups or startups to create their libraries and contribute to the development of antibodies as translational products. Encouragingly, some companies, such as Bio-Rad, now provide cost-effective antibody discovery services. Conversely, some phage display antibody libraries established prior to 2010 remain accessible to academic laboratories, notably at The University of Cambridge and the Scottish Biologics Facility. Of note among these libraries are Tomlinson's libraries, which have yielded high-affinity antibodies for numerous targets [92,93]. \n\nAntibody engineering through phage-display technology is a powerful but intricate process, facing several challenges that researchers have actively addressed to enhance its efficacy. One significant difficulty lies in achieving optimal binding affinities and specificities. The diverse and complex nature of target antigens often necessitates the meticulous optimization of phage display conditions to isolate antibodies with the desired properties. This involves multiple rounds of selection, sometimes requiring extensive screening and affinity maturation to enhance the binding capabilities of the displayed antibodies. Meanwhile, the issue of immunogenicity poses another obstacle in antibody engineering [13]. Antibodies derived from non-human sources, like murine antibodies, may trigger an immune response in humans. Humanization techniques, involving the grafting of CDRs onto human frameworks, have been developed to mitigate this challenge and create antibodies with reduced immunogenic potential [94]. Additionally, achieving functional antibodies with diverse isotypes and formats adds complexity to the engineering process. Scientists have explored different display formats, such as scFvs or Fab fragments, to optimize the selection of antibodies based on their intended applications [23]. Advancements in screening and selection methodologies have significantly improved the efficiency and throughput of antibody discovery using phage display. Techniques such as high-throughput screening, fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and next-generation sequencing allow for the rapid identification and characterization of antibodies with desired binding specificities and functional properties. Moreover, advances in library construction, selection methodologies, and molecular design have significantly improved the efficiency of isolating antibodies with high affinity, specificity, and reduced immunogenicity.",

            "text": "Display of foreign peptide on the bacteriophage surface without affecting phage infection was first described by George P. Smith in 1985. 37 Since then, phage display technology has been extensively applied to various applications, e.g., protein evolution (also known as directed evolution), epitope determination, identification of enzyme substrates, and drug discovery. 38 Since phenotype and genotype are physically linked in a phage display system, protein variants with desired properties can be rapidly selected through panning and the genetic information can be readily extracted. In a phage display system, a library in which diversified peptide or protein variants are displayed on phage surface is constructed (typically 10 10 \u2212 10 12 diversity). Variants with favored properties are enriched during iterative selection cycles. Unique sequences can then be screened for further applications. While the success of phage display has been demonstrated in a wide variety of areas, this review will focus on its application in therapeutic antibody discovery.\n\nAntibody phage display was originally developed in three institutes: Institute of Cell and Tumor Biology at German Cancer Research Center (Germany), 39 MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology (United Kingdom), 40,41 and Scripps Research Institute (United States). 42,43 Since then, various antibody fragment formats have been commonly used for phage display, such as single chain variable fragment (scFv), 44,45 antigen binding fragment (Fab), 24,46 single-domain antibody (VHH), 47,48 and bispecific antibody fragment. [49][50][51] Although display of full-length IgG on phage was also reported, 52,53 this platform was not widely used, likely due to unstable display, low display level, and bias on phage propagation, which resulted in limited functional diversity of the library. However, strategies for functional screening in fulllength IgG format after phage panning have been reported, e.g., dual host vector, 54 donor-acceptor system, 55 highthroughput reformatting, and mammalian expression of phage-derived antibodies. 56,57 Nevertheless, the display of full-length antibody can be readily achieved by eukaryotic display platforms, such as yeast and mammalian cell display.

The biospecificity of adalimumab demonstrates a realization of the expected advantages of phage display as a drug discovery technology. Additionally, the case of adalimumab demonstrates the contribution of phage display, in conjunction with guided selection methods. Adalimumab is approved for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis and plaque psoriasis. 25 According to the boxed warning in the US prescriber information, adalimumab is associated with a risk of serious infections and malignancy. 25 dalimumab was discovered using phage display with a \"guided selection\" method involving a mouse mAb. Briefly, the heavy chain of a murine antibody able to bind to TNF was combined with a collection of human light chains and selected for binding to hTNF. The selected light chains were then combined with a collection of human heavy chains and further selected for binding to hTNF and to an N-terminal peptide of hTNF. 26 In this strategy, a library of candidates is applied to immobilized antigen in the presence of a competitor that binds at the active site of interest.",

Thus, it has been successfully applied to identify mimotopes used to diagnose malaria (22) (23) , toxoplasmosis (24) (25) , hepatitis A (26) , neurocysticercosis (27) , strongyloidiasis (28) , thyroid cancer (29) , Chagas' disease (30) , and bovine anaplasmosis (31) , and to develop vaccine candidates against cysticercosis (32) , herpes simplex virus infection (33) , cancer (34) , taeniasis (35) , hepatitis B (36) , trichinellosis (37) , Alzheimer's disease (38) , and bovine anaplasmosis (39) . Phage display technology has been also instrumental in the selection of therapeutic agents to treat various cancers such as glioblastoma, melanoma, leukemia, and prostate and thyroid cancers (40) (41) . \n\nSeveral studies have applied phage display for the development of disease diagnostic markers. The strategy was fi rst used in neurocysticercosis diagnostics (42) . Recently, a phage-based enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assay has been employed to evaluate transmissible gastroenteritis virus infection in pigs (43) ; the study showed that ELISA coupled with phage display was a more sensitive method than conventional antibody-based ELISA. In another study, three peptides expressed in reactive phage clones and selected against serum from leprosy patients were successfully validated as tools for serological diagnosis of leprosy (44) . A similar approach has been applied to develop diagnostics for other animal and human diseases, such as neurocysticercosis (27) , strongyloidiasis (28) , and bovine anaplasmosis (39) . \n\nPhage particles carrying antigenic determinants may be directly used for therapy.",

            "text": "Cancer, a complex and multifaceted group of diseases characterized by uncontrolled cell growth, remains a significant global health challenge. The development of effective cancer treatment drugs is crucial in addressing this pervasive issue [82][83][84]. Among the diverse arsenal of therapeutic approaches, antibodies play a pivotal role due to their precision in targeting specific molecules associated with cancer cells. In the contemporary landscape, phage display stands out as one of the most prevalent and robust systems for the discovery and development of antibodies. Its widespread adoption is attributed to several advantages, such as the manipulable size of the phage's genome, the efficient nature of phage infection, the cost effectiveness and safety associated with phage preparation and propagation, and the ability to perform high-throughput screening for peptides and antibodies. Additionally, the technology allows for rapid screening, contributing to its appeal [85]. Despite these numerous advantages, it is crucial to acknowledge that there are still areas within this technology that demand further enhancement and refinement to meet evolving needs. \n\nAn advantageous aspect of the phage display library, in comparison to other antibody development technologies, lies in its swift and convenient retrieval of peptide sequence information [14]. Typically, the assessment focuses on the most abundant sequences obtained from the panning output. However, a challenge arises when very few specific clones, carrying a small percentage of the sequence information, are acquired. This limitation is a result of the amplification bias of the desirable antibody-displaying phages during the panning cycles, causing certain sequences to become increasingly rare throughout the process. Furthermore, it is essential to acknowledge the potential divergence in conformation between chemically synthesized peptides and their original state on the phage display. The presence of multiple copies of exogenously displayed peptides on the phages can lead to robust binding during the selection process. Therefore, maintaining the authentic conformation of phage-derived peptides during chemical synthesis becomes crucial to ensure that their binding strength remains comparable to the original phages. Additionally, a recurring challenge in this technology is the occurrence of false positives during screening. This issue arises from the non-specific absorption that can preoccupy the phages before positive selection, emphasizing the need for strategies to mitigate false positives and enhance the accuracy of the screening process [86].",

            "text": "Once display of a parent protein has been demonstrated, it is possible to build display libraries of 10 6 -10 11 variants from which variants having a desired binding property can be selected. In contrast, other screening methods such as chemical library or cell based screening allow testing of hundreds or thousands of synthetic compounds, or tens of thousands of plated colonies. In fact, 10 10 variants in a phage display library is actually a small part of the available theoretical sequence space. That is, the first set of binders to an antigen of interest can be subsequently diversified, retaining the sequence features that initially caused binding. This iterative variegation was used successfully to create high-affinity protease inhibitors of human plasmin, plasma kallikrein and thrombin, and it has become a common strategy in affinity maturation of drug candidates identified by phage display. 4,5 hage display was first described in 1985 and used to display short peptide fragments, 6 and the first patent was filed in 1991 (US5223409). 7 Since then, phage display has proven to be a reliable method for the generation of peptides with potential therapeutic or diagnostic utility. 8 Phage display of single-chain V-domain antibody fragments (scFv) was reported in 1990, along with selective recovery of the phage on the basis of antigen binding. 9 It has since become a major discovery platform for the identification of potent, fully human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). 10 More recently described antibody libraries have displayed Fab fragments on the phage protein, which can be readily reformatted to full-length IgG antibodies, usually without loss of binding function. 11,12 ources of diversity for phage display libraries includes immunized and na\u00efve, i.e., non-immunized, animals, as well as synthetic diversity. Use of immunized animals as a source of diversity can be attractive in that the resulting library will be biased toward the target of interest and should contain high-affinity antibodies that have been matured through the natural affinity maturation process. This approach, however, requires construction of new libraries for each new antigen and assumes that an immune response can be generated to the antigen of interest.",

Phage display represents a high-throughput technique for screening billions of random fusion antibodies against virtually any target on the surface or inside cancer cells, or even soluble markers found in patient serum. Many phage display derived binders targeting important tumor markers have been identified. Selection directed to tumoral cells\u2019 surfaces lead to the identification of unknown tumoral markers. Also the improvement of methods that require smaller amounts of cells has opened the possibility to use this approach on patient samples. Robust techniques combining an antibody library displayed on the phage surface and protein microarray allowed the identification of auto antibodies recognized by patient sera. Many Ab molecules directly or indirectly targeting angiogenesis have been identified, and one of them, ramucirumab, has been tested in 27 phase I\u2013III clinical trials in a broad array of cancers. Examples of such antibodies will be discussed here with emphasis on those used as probes for molecular imaging and other clinical trials.",

However, it was later shown that larger molecules like antibody fragments (scFV, Fab fragment, VHH domains) could be successfully displayed on phage (McCafferty et al., 1990;Benhar, 2001;Bradbury and Marks, 2004;Petrenko, 2008). The development of phages that display antibodies led to the emergence of a new molecular recognition interface to study protein-protein interactions, structure-function relationships, and protein folding and stability (Clackson et al., 1991;Vaughan et al., 1996). As a result, phage displayed cDNA libraries advanced significantly with a plethora of ligands fused to phage particles such as glycoproteins (Celik et al., 2010), enzymes (Soumillion et al., 1994), protease inhibitors (Markland et al., 1996), cytokines (Gram et al., 1993;Buchli et al., 1997), secreted as well as cytoplasmic, nuclear and membrane proteins (Vithayathil et al., 2011) to cite a few examples. \n\nWith the increasing number of phage display collections, numerous new applications have emerged.",

            "text": "The polyclonal antibodies purified from the serum of an immunized animal (mouse, rabbit, goat, lama, etc.) and mAb secreted by immortalized B cells from the spleen of an immunized animal are commonly used in immunological assays. Their dominant role in immunochemical applications faded after the appearance of phage-displayed antibodies, which are currently commonly used for the discovery and detection of cancer-specific antigens and biomarkers [28,30,76,77]. To isolate antibodies with the desired specificities, phage library selections must be performed on tumor-derived antigen sources. For example, the phage display strategy for the selection of rabbit monoclonal antibodies that recognize PC tumor-associated antigens was reported by Mikhail Popkov et al. [77]. Researchers immunized rabbits with either human PC cell line LNCap or DU145. Chimeric rabbit/human Fab libraries were generated through the oligo(dT)-primed, reverse transcription of RNA from the animal's spleen and bone marrow [78]. The antibody variable domains VL and VH were amplified, fused to human constant domains CL and CH1, and cloned into the phagemid vector pComb3X. Constructed in this way, phage-displayed chimeric rabbit/human Fab libraries were screened against human PC cells DU145 using a novel whole-cell panning protocol, resulting in the discovery of clones bound selectively to DU145 cells but not to primary human prostate epithelial cell line PrEC, as detected by flow cytometry. In summary, this work first demonstrated the potential of immune antibody libraries in the identification of imaging phage probes interacting with tumor-associated cell-surface antigens. A comprehensive review describing the progress in the preparation and use of recombinant phage-displayed antibodies for bioanalytical applications was published recently by Guliy et al. [30]. PSA is a serum marker that is commonly used for the diagnosis of prostatic diseases.",

            "text": "The journey of generating antibodies through phage display technology commences with the construction of a diverse library. This process entails integrating genetic material encoding antibody fragments, such as antibodies' heavy and light chains, single-chain variable fragments (scFvs), Fabs, or peptides, into the genome of bacteriophages, notably filamentous ones like M13 [10]. This fusion results in the expression of a multitude of unique antibody candidates on the surface of phages, forming the basis of the library. The diversity of this library, ranging from millions to billions of variants, lays the groundwork for the subsequent exploration of potential binding partners (Figure 1) [11]. \n\nfoundation for the subsequent refinement and enhancement of phage display technology. The significant contributions of George P. Smith and Greg Winter culminated in the recognition of a half share of the 2018 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their seminal work in developing phage display. \n\nUp to now, the impact of phage display in generating antibodies extends across diverse applications. In the field of therapeutics, it has played a pivotal role in the development of monoclonal antibodies for various diseases, including cancer, autoimmune disorders, infectious diseases, and neurological conditions. Furthermore, phage display has significantly contributed to the discovery of antibodies targeting specific viral pathogens, such as influenza and HIV, providing valuable tools for both diagnosis and treatment [7,8]. Beyond therapeutics, phage display has been instrumental in antibody engineering, epitope mapping, and the study of protein interactions. Additionally, it has facilitated the identification of novel peptide ligands for drug targeting, the development of biosensors for disease detection, and the creation of protein libraries for enzyme optimization and protein-protein interaction studies [9]. Overall, phage display continues to revolutionize biotechnology and biomedical research by enabling the rapid and efficient generation of high-affinity antibodies and protein-based therapeutics for a wide range of applications.",

A CAT, Cambridge Antibody Technology human antibody phage display library; HuCAL, Human combinatorial antibody library; PBL, Bone marrow, peripheral blood lymphocytes; TRIM, trinucleotide-directed mutagenesis method. selection of phage display-derived therapeutics was described in great detail previously (171,172), yet we here present an updated and comprehensive review of phage display-derived mAbs. Two decades after McCafferty and Winter's seminal report in 1990, more than 70 phage-derived mAbs entered clinical studies, and 14 of them have been approved. The majority of these antibodies are generated by three company-owned libraries, Cambridge Antibody Technology (CAT), Dyax and MorphoSys's human combinatorial antibody libraries (HuCAL R ) (Table 1, Figure 4). MorphoSys's HuCAL R has the highest number of mAbs (20 mAbs), wherein 19 are under clinical development, and one (Tremfya TM ) is approved. The majority of the MorphoSys's HuCAL R derived mAbs (12 mAbs) are in phase II clinical trials. CAT (AstraZenica) has the second highest number of phage derived mAbs (15 mAbs) in clinical trials, and the highest number of approved mAbs including Humira R , Benlysta R , Lumoxiti TM , ABthrax R , and Gamifant R . Dyax has 13 mAbs in which four of them have been approved; Bavencio R , Portrazza TM , Cyramza R , Takhzyro R . \n\nTherapeutic mAbs from phage libraries can be successfully isolated to treat cancer, and non-cancer medical conditions, such as inflammatory, optical, infectious, or immunological diseases (Table 2). However, some of the aforementioned major libraries have a favorable therapeutic area of application.",

            "text": "In a recent investigation conducted by Dong, Sa et al. (144), anti-Cry1A polyclonal antibodies were employed as antigens to screen for anti-variant antibodies capable of mimicking the Cry1A toxin, using a phage display human domain antibody library. Following four rounds of biopanning, five positive clones exhibiting binding activity were identified, with clone D6 displaying a remarkable inhibitory effect on the binding of Cry1A toxin and anti-Cry1A polyclonal antibodies. D6 was characterized as a subtype anti-idiotypic antibody, proficient in mimicking Cry1A toxin and competitively binding to anti-Cry1A polyclonal antibodies. Intriguingly, bioassay results demonstrated that D6 possessed discernible insecticidal activity. The study lays a foundation for the development of toxin simulators, offering promising applications in the domains of agriculture and environmental protection. \n\nNotably, Xu, Chongxin, et al. ( 145) have achieved a significant breakthrough in the field of toxin monitoring by developing a highly sensitive anti-microcystin single-chain variable fragment (scFv). The application of this scFv in an established ELISA showcased promising prospects for ultra-sensitive detection in water samples. Besides competitive immunoassays, innovative nanobody-based methods have also emerged, among which the phage display mediated immunopolymerase chain reaction (PD-IPCR) technique deserves special mention. PD-IPCR harnesses recombinant phage particles as readily available reagents for IPCR, obviating the need for conventional monoclonal antibodies (146), as shown in Figure 8. This technique exhibits tremendous potential as an ultra-sensitive assay for small molecules, rendering it a valuable tool for monitoring toxins in both environmental and clinical samples. Furthermore, Rezaei, Zahra S. et al. (147) have made strides in the detection of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by developing a precise PCR-conjugated phage display system using VHH nanobodies. This innovative approach, known as PD-IPCR, presents new avenues for VEGF detection, highlighting the versatility and potential of nanobody-based methods in diagnostics and therapeutics.",

Phage display is based on generating a library of synthetic or natural peptides and then fusing them onto a coat protein of a bacteriophage. Modified phages that bind strongly to the ligand displayed are enriched via sequential recovery from the surface and upon that they re-infect bacteria to propagate and increase in number. Filamentous phages M13 [25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33] and fd [34][35][36] are the most commonly used phages for phage display although T4, 37,38 T7 [39][40][41][42][43] and lambda [44][45][46][47] phages have also been used. Traditionally phage display has been used for antibody production, proteomics, 48 therapeutics, diagnostics (specially for cancer applications), infectious diseases and drug discovery. 49,50 Phage display has also been used for epitope mapping, a method to identify the epitope of the antigen that interacts with an antibody. The identification of epitopes is important for the development of diagnostic tools, vaccines and new therapeutic targets. 51,52 Additionally, phage display has proven useful in targeting membrane receptors via the identification of their agonists and antagonists, which present biological applications as drugs for various diseases. 53 5][56][57] Its biggest advantage, compared to other methods established in the protein-protein interactions field, is that highly diverse peptide libraries can be constructed at low cost. 56 These are some of the applications of phage display.

            "text": "Phage Display has been widely applied to develop novel therapeutic antibodies. Impressively, 18% of all antibodies commercially approved owe their origins to this technology. Most of the Phage Display-derived antibodies that have gained clinical approval have been tailored for deployment in cancer (36%) and immunoregulation (32%) applications (Figure 1A) (Table 1). \n\nsubjects, are difficult to find, but even non-immunized human libraries have been used successfully to obtain high-affinity antibodies against either self-or non-self-antigens [17]. \n\nPhage Display libraries can also be developed from variants of a single antibody. One of these approaches relies on the use of directed evolution to select high-affinity mutants from a scFv library that has been randomly mutated through error-prone PCR (epPCR), as previously described [18,19]. Random mutagenesis might be useful to obtain mature antibodies with different kinetic parameters (different association/dissociation rates). Direct evolution of antibody affinity can also be accomplished using libraries of CDRs (complementary determinant regions) of variable domains, mainly CDR3H. CDR3H variants were randomly generated using degenerate oligonucleotides where codons such as NNS were used, raising the possibility of any of the twenty amino acids being coded, while reducing the change to an unwanted stop-codon [20]. Antibody fragments may also be isolated from infected organisms [21][22][23], as demonstrated by selecting Fab fragments from HIV-1-positive individuals. This is particularly interesting for infectious diseases as these subjects are considered immunized and, therefore, produce higher--affinity antibodies. This strategy has also been previously Since the early 1990s, when Phage Display started to become a popular strategy to select antibody fragments, several types of libraries have been developed. One of the first libraries constructed [15] used mouse scFv and Fab fragments. In the same year, Barbas III and co-workers (1991) developed a protocol to construct combinatorial libraries from human repertoire based on Fab fragments [16]. These libraries rely on the random rearrangement of heavy and light chains amplified from immune cells, either from immunized or na\u00efve animals.",

(22) and for the critical profiling of the repertoire of antibody specificities of polyclonal sera, i.e. profiling the IgOme (23,24), see also (25).\n\nAn implicit assumption in phage displayed based applications is that the library to be screened truly represents an unbiased comprehensive collection of peptides from which affinity selection can proceed.The selected peptides can be taken, therefore, to faithfully represent the structural idiosyncrasies and/or specific binding activities of the antibody (or antibodies) being analyzed.",

            "text": "Over the last two decades, many methods have been used to screen proteins, among which surface display technology were very important. To be specific, phage display was the most convenient method, besides bacterial and ribosomal screening methods (Goracci, Pignochino & Marchi\u00f2, 2020). Accordingly, the application of the method will increase in the future (Zambrano-Mila, Blacio & Vispo, 2020). \n\nExisting studies suggested that phage display technology will be combined with next generation sequencing to improve screening accuracy, reducing the occurrence of non-specific false positive clones. And it can speed up the identification process of target specific ligands (Lemire, Yehl & Lu, 2018). The use of phage display techniques to construct single chain antibody libraries for screening scFvs was elucidated in this review, and it had played an integral role in vaccine development and cancer treatment (Sokullu, Gauthier & Coulombe, 2021). Cancer kills around 10 million people worldwide each year (Torre et al., 2016). The main problems are the lack of methods to target drugs to tumor sites and the lack of therapeutic agents with high specificity (Lin et al., 2021). In contrast, phage antibodies are diverse tumor binding libraries that may be useful for potential therapeutic agents and the development of new diagnostics (Lindberg et al., 2021). The development of a human lung diagnostic protein microarray with novel screening markers using the T7 phage cDNA library has been reported previously. In contrast to the conventional identification of the presence of lung cancer by lung tumor markers, the novel phage library technology enabled patients to detect and treat cancer at an early stage (Hirsch et al., 2017). Previous research has demonstrated that phage display technology has been employed in the treatment of cancer and the treatment of infectious diseases (e.g., leprosy and infantile leishmaniasis) (Alban et al., 2014;Coelho et al., 2015;Alban et al., 2014). Combining cell surface-specific markers of parasitic infections with phage antibody libraries ultimately screens peptide compounds for the development of anti-parasitic drugs (Kuzmicheva & Belyavskaya, 2016).",

            "text": "Monoclonal antibodies are recognised as an important class of drug especially against autoimmune diseases, cancers and infectious diseases [156,166]. To accommodate the increased interest in biomedical applications of antibodies, antibody phage display technology has provided an alternative for rapid discovery and broad utilisation of novel, highly specific and fully human antibodies [167].\n\nSince the introduction of monoclonal antibody technology by Kohler and Milstein in 1975, antibodies have become important biomolecules due to their capability to be applied in various fields, and most importantly in diagnostic, therapeutics, and vaccine development [168]. The potential of applications of na\u00efve antibodies isolated from na\u00efve libraries in diagnostics had been demonstrated in few publications. Isolated scFv and Fab antibody fragments against native spores of Bacillus subtilis IFO 3336 were labelled with two different fluorescent dyes (FITC or rhodamine-N-hydroxysuccinimide) for direct and indirect detection by fluorescence microscope. The detection signal was greatly amplified when fluorescent dye was labelled to the highcopy number of phage coat protein pVIII of the antibody phage particles. Direct detection of individual spores was made possible by fluorescent-labelled antibody-phage clones [139]. These spore binding antibodies could be further incorporated into other detection systems such as high-flow-rate fluidized bed as solid phase capture [169], electrochemiluminescent immunoassay (ECLIA) [170], and magnetic particle fluorogenic immunoassay (MPFIA) [170].\n\nAnother example was demonstrated by L. acidophilus species specific scFv isolated with phage display technology. The resulting scFvs isolated was applied in FACS for enrichment of L. acidophilus which resulted in more than 99.8% genome coverage. It was envisioned that this species specific antibodies could be applied to enrich low abundance organism in a community which could lead to better taxonomic identification and genome recovery prior to genome sequencing [143].\n\nConversion of antibody fragments into full IgG format or Fc format is always preferable for therapeutics [171]. Na\u00efve Fab antibody fragments isolated against HA region of H5N1 virus were converted into full human IgG format. These antibodies showed binding to conserved region HA2 and exhibited promising",

Thus, the use of Phage Display to identify antibodies against DENV, as well as for other flavivirus, can contribute to the knowledge of the specific antigenic properties of the virus, allowing to generate new perspectives for the development of efficient therapies, vaccines, and diagnostic platforms of this virus. \n\nTo obtain specific antibodies to the DENV, it is possible to employ different libraries of Phage Display and distinct selection approaches depending on the purpose. Using a llama immune library, a diagnostic methodology was developed based on antibodies capable of binding to the NS1 of the four DENV serotypes, without cross-reacting with NS1 of other flaviviruses. The panning was performed with immobilized antigen, so that in each round, the phage population was incubated with NS1 from one of the serotypes, resulting in phage specific to all forms of NS1. To characterize the diagnostic potential of the antibodies, MAbs were addressed [71]. Lebani et al. [72] isolate four serotype-specific human antibodies through a negative selection strategy. Each MAb was specific for NS1 from a DENV serotype, without cross-linking. \n\nIn another approach, Cabezas et al. [73] worked with human na\u00efve library to obtain a panel of antibody fragments with different specificity toward DENV serotypes. The biopanning was made against inactivated DENV-containing supernatants harvested from infected Vero cells for 4 days with each serotype. These supernatants were directly used for Phage Display biopanning. A panel of nine scFvs, where seven were specific for DENV2, DENV3, and DENV4 while the other two were cross-reactive, was obtained.",

The innovative strategy of mAb screening, utilizing phage display, facilitates the in vitro screening of antibodies with high affinity to target antigens.

This report outlines a detailed and comprehensive procedure for constructing a scFv phagemid library derived from human patients, followed by screening via phage display affinity selection. The protocol utilizes 348 primer combinations spanning the entire human antibody repertoire to minimize sequence bias and maintain library diversity during polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for scFv generation, resulting in a library size greater than 1 \u00d7 108. Furthermore, we describe a high-throughput phage display screening protocol using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to evaluate more than 1200 scFv candidates. The generation of a highly diverse scFv library, coupled with the implementation of a phage display screening methodology, is expected to provide a valuable resource for researchers in pursuit of scFvs with high affinity for target antigens, thus advancing both research and clinical endeavors.",

            "text": "generally used to measure and identify the contents of antigens in multivalent vaccines. To date, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against V. cholerae O1 have been obtained by immunization of mice with the LPS or strain(s) of Ogawa and Inaba serotypes using hybridoma technology [8,[10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21]. Most of the mAbs reacted with both Inaba and Ogawa serotypes, due to the minor structural differences in these serotypes, and few of them were Ogawa-or Inaba-serotype specific [8,14]. \n\nThe advent of phage display technology has enabled facile isolation of mAbs from combinatorial antibody libraries [22,23]. The major advantages of phage display include the virtual independence of the selection process from target characteristics, which allows application to a wide range of antigens, irrespective of their immunogenicity or toxicity, and the full control over the selection conditions [24]. The isolation of mAbs by phage display employs a na\u00efve antibody library generated from donor-derived B cells, immune library, a synthetic library from synthetically derived diversity, or a semi-synthetic library in single-chain Fv (scFv) or Fab format [25][26][27][28][29][30][31]. ScFv fragments often have a high tendency to form multimers as well as aggregates and have been found to lose affinity during conversion to Ig (immunoglobulin)G, whereas Fab fragments have been found to possess comparably higher structural stability by the presence of the CH1 and light-chain constant domain (CL), and thus their binding activities were retained after conversion to IgG [32].",

            "text": "Immuno-diagnosis of infectious disease is based on the ability to detect the presence of disease-related antibodies in clinical samples, such as serum. For this, Mario Geysen produced pathogen-defining \"Pepscans\" comprised of tiled overlapping synthetic-peptides that served as bait in solid phase immunoassays (15). Here, as an alternative to synthetic-peptides, we employ comprehensive phagedisplayed arrays of deconvoluted viral antigens, producing \"Domain-Scans\". The use of phage-display, as a means to present peptides for antibody interrogation, offers a number of advantages: (1) Peptides ranging from tens to hundreds of amino acids can easily be expressed; (2) Once cloned, the peptide library can be amplified to produce high titer-stock solutions that can be replenished endlessly; (3) The screening of phage-display peptide arrays can be conducted in small manageable micro-volumes, making phage-displayed Domain-Scans particularly amenable to high-throughput applications, screening numerous samples easily; (4) NGS multiplexing allows the analysis of the affinity-selected peptides, generating mega-data portraying a broader and more comprehensive view of the humoral immune response to infection and other morbidities. \n\nSuch application of NGS and T7 phage-display was reported previously by Xu and colleagues in their production of \"VirScans\" (16). The VirScan library contains a total of 93,904 56-mer peptides that correspond to over 1,000 strains of 206 human infectious viruses. Combined with NGS, Xu and colleagues have been able to study the diversity of viruses that infect human populations, survey the range that different viruses infect individuals and identify antigenic epitopes of diagnostic value (16). The application of the VirScans has already proven useful (17)(18)(19). \n\nIn this study, we created six phage-displayed Domain-Scans that represent two pathogens, HIV-1 and HCV, containing a total of 339 peptides of 15, 20, and 50 amino acids in length.",

            "text": "detection. Gene and colleagues (Gene et al., 2015) used naive and immune camelid antibody libraries for the selection via phage display of diagnostic nanobodies against internalin B (InIB), a protein which is strongly involved in host-cell invasion. Two of the five generated nanobodies, R3-03 and R3-30, showed picomolar binding affinities to InIB, representing a valuable resource for bacteria immunodetection in poorly concentrated samples. A recent study from Moreira et al. (2020) described the use in combination of different phage display techniques to identify new Listeria spp. protein biomarkers and rise antibodies against them. Initially, the human na\u00efve antibody display phage library HAL9/10 was used to generate antibodies against different cell fractions from L. monocytogenes (cell wall, membrane, and cytoplasm). This way, four binders were isolated, which allowed the identification of a novel target for Listeria spp. detection named pyruvate dehydrogenase complex-enzyme 2 (PDC-E2) by using both immunomagnetic separation/mass spectrometry (IMS-MS) and ORFeome phage display. One of these antibodies was also used in immunofluorescence on non-permeabilized cells confirming the surface localization of the target. Antibody selection against PDC-E2 recombinant antigen yielded 16 additional antibodies. These 20 antibodies were finally tested in indirect ELISA against a panel of 17 Listeria species (including the most virulent L. monocytogenes serotypes 4b, 1/2a, and 1/2b) and 16 non-Listeria species. Two antibodies, GSM313-E9 and GSM313-H8, provided 100% sensitivity and specificity for Listeria spp. detection. Moreover, the binding region (epitope) of 18 out of the 20 antibodies was identified via single-gene phage display for epitope mapping, enabling to define the lipoyl domains of PDC-E2 as the major contributors for the detection through this target.",

            "text": "Phage display was first described by George Smith in the 1980s for studying proteinprotein interactions [10]. Since then, the phage display technology has evolved to be of utility within many other areas of biomedical sciences, including the study of antibodies [11]. Phage display libraries are widely used to both discover novel antigen-specific monoclonal antibodies and also to epitope map existing antibodies [12,13]. However, while phage-display technology for studying antibody responses have been present for several decades, it has often been plagued by several common issues. For example, phage display libraries are often created using random n-mers [14] or cDNA products [15,16], which when created from the target tissue through random priming leads to ORFs of various lengths or premature stop codons [17]. Furthermore, earlier phage display technologies utilize the M13 lysogenic phage display system, which requires antigenic phages to be translocated across the periplasmic membrane, thereby introducing bias against certain amino acid peptide sequences [18]. Fortunately, advances in molecular technologies (such as microarray-based DNA synthesis and high throughput sequencing) and the use of T7 bacteriophage has enabled PhIP-Seq to overcome these challenges [9].",

            "text": "Phage display is an antibody discovery tool that screens bacteriophage presenting a library of variable antibody domains against a target antigen. Through multiple rounds of incubation with the target, washing away unbound phage, and amplifying bound phage, the library is reduced to those clones with affinity and specificity to the antigen. 1,2 Individual clones can be selected or screened from this sublibrary and converted into an IgG format for use as diagnostic or therapeutic reagents.\n\nThough effective, traditional phage display suffers from key limitations. Conventionally, >5 rounds of selection are required to generate clones with high affinity to the target. The cost and time requirements of repeat rounds (approximately 6\u22128 weeks and $8,000\u221210,000 USD in total) are a bottleneck in the discovery of new therapeutics. 3,4 The difficulty in controlling stringency during binding causes many candidates from the enriched phage pools to represent false positives that fail in vitro validation. 5,6 An inability to recapitulate the low relative concentration and morphology of targets in vitro may also lead to candidates failing later during in vivo testing. 7 The stochastic nature of selection results in thousands of nonspecific clones, requiring further screening for elimination. Further, variations in the efficiency of bacterial amplification result in candidates being missed due to low representation. 8, 9 To address these issues, variations of the phage display approach have been developed. These include performing selection with antigens presented on a cell surface 10 and with mixed cell types, 11 incorporating microfluidics to control the binding dynamics, 12,13 and using next-generation sequencing (NGS) and bioinformatics analysis to choose clones for validation, to further library design, 14 or to eliminate nonspecific clones. 15 Although the feasibility of these approaches has been explored, a comprehensive platform combining these novel features to produce high-performing antibodies in a reduced number of rounds against a challenging therapeutic target has yet to be demonstrated.\n\nIn this paper, we present such a platform: \u03bcCellect. To recapitulate the in vivo binding environment, antigens are presented on the surface of a cell with a large background of nonspecific cell types.

            "text": "This issue arises from the non-specific absorption that can preoccupy the phages before positive selection, emphasizing the need for strategies to mitigate false positives and enhance the accuracy of the screening process [86]. To address this issue, recent advancements have integrated next-generation sequencing technologies into the phage display library. This integration aims to identify the rare sequences holding potential binding affinity and predict the binding features of sequences obtained during the panning process [87,88]. \n\nThe phage display library finds another compelling application in the development of tumor-targeting peptides, particularly for diagnostic purposes [89,90]. These peptides play a pivotal role in creating imaging agents designed to specifically illuminate cancerous lesions. By associating with nanoparticle conjugation, these peptides not only enhance sensitivity in cancer diagnosis, but also contribute to improved contrast imaging capabilities. An inherent advantage of leveraging phage display libraries for tumor-targeting peptide development lies in the vast and diverse pool of peptide sequences that can be explored. This unique feature enables the discovery of peptides with the capacity to selectively recognize and bind to the distinctive molecular signatures present on the surface of cancer cells [48,91]. While fluorescent antibodies are currently employed in molecular imaging for their exceptional affinity and selectivity, peptides emerge as superior carriers for guiding imaging probes to tumor sites due to their effective tissue penetration-an attribute not easily achievable with antibodies. Despite its recognized potential, the clinical use of tumortargeting peptides has been limited, primarily due to challenges related to immunogenicity, clearance issues, and a lack of a comprehensive understanding of their behavior within the human body. Addressing these hurdles requires ongoing efforts to unlock the full potential of tumor-targeting peptides in the realm of cancer diagnostics, ensuring their effective and safe utilization in clinical settings. \n\nWhile phage display has matured into a well-established platform for antibody development, the commercial utilization of major phage display platforms, as outlined in Table 1, has predominantly been limited to a handful of biopharmaceutical companies holding intellectual property rights. Consequently, a majority of the antibodies developed today are owned by these companies with proprietary access to the underlying technologies.",

            "text": "The versatility of phage display has revolutionized various fields ranging from antibody discovery (Parmley and Smith, 1988;Fellouse et al., 2007;Thie et al., 2009;Jones et al., 2010) to protein-protein interaction studies (Fuh et al., 2000;Hertveldt et al., 2009). Phage displays enable rapid antibody identification with the desired binding properties and contribute to deciphering protein networks and molecular interactions, thus leading to advancements in diagnostics (Kirsch et al., 2008;Deutscher, 2010;Kuhn et al., 2016;Li et al., 2023), therapeutics (Ladner et al., 2004;Saw and Song, 2019;Daly et al., 2023), and vaccine development (Gnanasekar et al., 2004;Wang and Yu, 2005;Aghebati-Maleki et al., 2016;Sol\u00eds-Lucero et al., 2016;Stern et al., 2019;Staquicini et al., 2021;Grabowski et al., 2023). Phage displays also hold promise for applications in nanotechnology and biomaterials. For example, phage display-selected peptides demonstrate a penchant for binding to diverse nanoparticles such as ZnO (Golec et al., 2016) and Fe 3 O 4 (Rawlings et al., 2015;You et al., 2016) and can also act as biosensors for detecting explosives or pathogens (Jaworski et al., 2008;Gut\u00e9s et al., 2013;Rawlings et al., 2015;Peng and Chen, 2019;Wang et al., 2021). In the field of tissue engineering, this technique guides researchers in identifying peptides such as arginylglycylaspartic acid (RGD) by using phage display libraries (Pasqualini et al., 1997).",

            "text": "In the last decades, numerous combinatorial methodologies for the selection and screening of proteins were developed, which mimic natural evolutionary processes in vitro and aim at detecting interaction partners with specific chemical and/or physical properties. Among these, surface display technologies play a central role and besides bacterial, ribosomal, yeast and other screening methods, phage display is by far the most widespread application for screening of protein interaction partners or selecting antibodies for diagnostic and therapeutic applications [76]. \n\nWith the latest developments discussed here, the presentation of cDNA and ORF expression products on phage has become not only possible, but led to an increase in library quality, produced indepth analysis of the enrichment process, became faster, more convenient and reasonably priced. Thus the application of this approach and variations thereof will increase constantly in the future. Most application areas described in this review centre around the identification of novel allergens, potential biomarkers in autoimmune disorders [43,77], cancer [78,79] or vaccine development [80]. However, additional fields of application, such as screening for cellular targets of toxic chemical compounds emerge [81]. \n\nThe next level of phage display will indisputably see the implementation of NGS into automation strategies for screening of combinatorial libraries [82]. The application of semi-automated selection strategies, such as developed in our laboratory [83,84] not only allows the reduction of variability and increased reproducibility of the selection protocol, but can be readily implemented in process pipelines based on unit-automation [85,86]. Such pipelines, in turn, can be easily extended to include NGS as a sophisticated analysis tool of the selection outcome. \n\nTwenty-five years after its introduction, phage display persists to be the most popular and successful surface display application with more than 4,000 entries in PubMed. With the latest developments in library design and the combination of phage display with high-throughput selection pipelines and next generation sequencing, the field has become as vibrant as ever.",

Therein, antibody fragments (e.g., single-chain Fv fragments; scFvs) with a variety of mutations are displayed on bacteriophage to generate diverse phage-antibody libraries. Rare clones with improved functions are then selected via panning against immobilized or tagged target antigens. However, this selection process often ended unsuccessful, mainly due to the biased propagation of phage-antibody clones and the competition with a large excess of undesirable clones with weaker affinities. To break radically from such panning-inherent problems, we developed a novel method, clonal array profiling of scFv-displaying phages (CAP), in which colonies of the initial bacterial libraries are examined one-by-one in microwells. Progenies of scFv-displaying phages generated are, if show sufficient affinity to target antigen, captured in the microwell via pre-coated antigen and detected using a luciferase-fused anti-phage scFv. The advantage of CAP was evidenced by its application with a small error-prone-PCR-based library (~\u2009105 colonies) of anti-cortisol scFvs. Only two operations, each surveying only\u2009~\u20093% of the library (9,400 colonies), provided five mutants showing 32\u201363-fold improved Ka values (>\u20091010 M\u22121), compared with the wild-type scFv (Ka\u2009=\u20093.8\u2009\u00d7\u2009108 M\u22121), none of which could be recovered via conventional panning procedures operated for the entire library.",

            "text": "ABSTRACT Phage display technology in combination with next-generation sequencing (NGS) currently is a state-of-the-art method for the enrichment and isolation of monoclonal antibodies from diverse libraries. However, the current NGS methods employed for sequencing phage display libraries are limited by the short contiguous read lengths associated with second-generation sequencing platforms. Consequently, the identification of antibody sequences has conventionally been restricted to individual antibody domains or to the analysis of single domain binding moieties such as camelid VHH or cartilaginous fish IgNAR antibodies. In this study, we report the application of third-generation sequencing to address this limitation. We used single molecule real time (SMRT) sequencing coupled with hairpin adaptor loop ligation to facilitate the accurate interrogation of full-length single-chain Fv (scFv) libraries. Our method facilitated the rapid isolation and testing of scFv antibodies enriched from phage display libraries within days following panning. Two libraries against CD160 and CD123 were panned and monitored by NGS. Analysis of NGS antibody data sets led to the isolation of several functional scFv antibodies that were not identified by conventional panning and screening strategies. Our approach, which combines phage display selection of immune libraries with the full-length interrogation of scFv fragments, is an easy method to discover functional antibodies, with a range of affinities and biophysical characteristics.",

Our group has isolated human antibodies against components of the modified extracellular matrix that are currently being investigated in clinical trials either as radiolabeled products or as cytokine fusion proteins. 13,14 In particular, the F8 antibody, which is specific to the alternatively-spliced extra domain (EDA) of fibronectin, 15 the L19 antibody (specific to the alternativelyspliced EDB of fibronectin [16][17][18] ) and the F16 antibody (specific to the alternatively-spliced A1 domain of tenascin-C 19 ) have exhibited an impressive potential to selectively localize at neovascular structures in solid tumors and in lymphomas. 20 The three antibodies were isolated from the ETH2-GOLD synthetic antibody library 11,21 and affinity-matured using a procedure Human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) can routinely be isolated from phage display libraries against virtually any protein available in sufficient purity and quantity, but library design can influence epitope coverage on the target antigen. Here we describe the construction of a novel synthetic human antibody phage display library that incorporates hydrophilic or charged residues at position 52 of the CDR2 loop of the variable heavy chain domain, instead of the serine residue found in the corresponding germline gene. The novel library was used to isolate human mAbs to various antigens, including the alternatively-spliced EDA domain of fibronectin, a marker of tumor angiogenesis. In particular, the mAb 2H7 was proven to bind to a novel epitope on EDA, which does not overlap with the one recognized by the clinical-stage F8 antibody.",

            "text": "Phage has a unique biological feature that allows it to efficiently link the genes coding the phage and the proteins presented on the surface. Such a feature makes phage an excellent tool for antibody screening. Phage display, a technique to study the protein-ligand interaction, has been widely used in laboratories. It is one of the most effective molecular diversity techniques. Phage display is based on the fact that an encapsulated library of genotypes can be directly associated with the presentation of a library of molecules on the phage surface. Phage display has been used in a variety of applications, including epitope mapping-where a library of peptide expressing phage is used to interact with a specific antibody, therefore to pinpoint the specific epitope sequence the antibody is interacting with [112]; ligand identification for receptors-similar to antibody mapping, peptides interacting with receptors can be identified [113]; protein-protein interactionswhere phage can present large proteins that are potentially interacting with a known binding partner, therefore to identify the unknown binding partners and to study the mechanism of interactions [114]; directed evolution of proteins-mutations conferring binding advantages between two proteins can be studied using a phage display library containing these variants [115]; drug discovery-peptides or ligands that can interact with drug targets can be presented through phage display [116]; and antibody screening-where a large library of antibody-displaying phage can be screened for the best antibodies that can interact with the target antigens [117]. \n\nPhage display has recently been used to screen for antibodies that can directly interact with neoantigens specific to cancer cells, thus producing a powerful method for establishing novel cancer therapeutic methods [7]. The screening procedure is conceptually simple. A DNA library encoding a large amount of antibody fragments can be synthesized or obtained, and cloned into phage vectors [118]. Phage carrying a specific DNA sequence can present an antibody or antibody fragment protein on its surface and therefore facilitate potential bindings between the phage and neoantigen targets [119]. When identifying the neoantigen binder phages, there are several critical steps that need to be ensured.",

            "text": "Antibody phage display is an in vitro screening technique that allows for rapid selection of multiple monoclonal antibodies of high affinity and specificity (Hoogenboom, 2005). It involves the display of a polyclonal collection of antibody fragments containing the variable regions, numbering up to 10 11 different clones, on the surface of filamentous phage carrying the genetic sequence of the displayed fragment. Antibody library repertoires can be obtained primarily by two methods, either from cDNA antibody sequences derived from the B cells of immunized or non-immune animal or human donors, or synthetically generated using random nucleotide sequences within selected CDRs (complementarity-determining regions) in combination with one or multiple framework regions to replicate the diversity of a natural antibody repertoire (Conrad and Scheller, 2005). These sequences are then fused to the sequence encoding the gene III (gIII) coat protein of the phage, enabling expression and incorporation of the antibody fragment on its surface. This collection of phage-displayed antibodies is then panned repeatedly against the antigen of interest, producing a polyclonal phage collection enriched for antigen-specific antibodies, from which individual monoclonal clones can then be identified and characterized. \n\nThe rapidity of this technique makes it ideal for generating novel antibodies for diagnostic and potentially therapeutic responses to outbreaks of emerging infectious disease such as SARS coronavirus and H5N1 Avian Influenza or genetically modified pathogens released in a bioterrorism incident. Since antibodies are highly specific and are capable of recognizing virtually every class of pathogen, including toxins, viruses, bacteria and fungi, they enable easy and rapid identification of pathogens (Nowakowski et al., 2002;Hayhurst et al., 2003;Paoli et al., 2004;Steiniger et al., 2007;Cabezas et al., 2008). Indeed, sandwich ELISAs utilizing high affinity mouse monoclonal antibodies have been developed against likely bioterrorist threats such as epsilon toxin of Clostridium botulinum and protective antigen, a toxin component of anthrax, with demonstrated toxin detection limits of 1-2 ng/ml (el Idrissi and Ward, 1992;Mabry et al., 2006).",

            "text": "The generation and selection of peptide libraries displayed on filamentous phage marked the advent of display technologies. 75 The use of phage display for the generation and selection of antibody libraries, displayed in either scFv [76][77][78] or Fab 79,80 format, revolutionized the field of mAbs and antibody engineering in the early 1990s, arguably accelerated by an intense competition between researchers at the Medical Research Council (Cambridge, UK) and The Scripps Research Institute (La Jolla, California, USA). Over the past 20 years, phage display has proven to be the most robust and versatile mining tool for human antibody repertoires, yielding human mAbs to virtually any antigen of interest. 8 The process of multiple rounds of selection on a purified antigen or on antigen-expressing cells, referred to as panning, can be adapted to positively or negatively select a range of desired antibody properties, such as affinity, specificity, manufacturability and catalytic activity. While scFv (~25 kDa) and Fab (~50 kDa) still dominate the phage display format, human antibody repertoires have also been mined through the display and selection of single variable domains (~12.5 kDa) of heavy and light chain. 81,82 ypically, recombinant fusion to the N-terminus of phage protein pIII or a fragment of pIII provides the physical linkage of antibody fragment and phage, facilitating monovalent display in phagemid systems and multivalent display in phage systems. 83 ther multivalent display systems use phage proteins pVIII and pIX as fusion partners. 79,84 For the generation of human mAbs with high affinity, monovalent Fab display through phage protein pIII is generally preferred. 85 Phage display relies on the expression offering a diverse and attractive repertoire of antigen specificities readily available in the blood. As memory B cells contain only relatively small quantities of specific RNA, the successful cloning of both heavy and light chain variable domains from a single B cell poses a significant technical challenge. In spite of this, antibodies have successfully been cloned from single peripheral B cells, including mAbs against self-antigens, 61,62 tetanus toxoid 57 and HIV-1 gp140. 63",

            "text": "The discovery of hybridoma technology, described by K\u00f6hler and Milstein (1975), and the subsequent ability to develop monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) initiated a paradigm shift in antibody research and their clinical development. Yet, despite representing a major breakthrough in antibody-based therapy, early clinical studies demonstrated that unmodified murine mAbs presented properties that limited their use in the clinical setting. One of the most important shortcomings was the high immunogenic character of these mAbs that resulted in the generation of human anti-mouse antibody response (HAMA) that limited their therapeutic utility. Furthermore, murine mAbs demonstrated decreased serum half-life and inability to elicit human effector responses (Khazaeli et al., 1994;Hwang and Foote, 2005;Presta, 2006). To overcome these limitations, antibody engineering techniques have been explored and used to manipulate murine mAbs into chimeric or humanized antibodies by modifying their constant regions in human variants, which led to a reduction in HAMA response while promoting an efficacy optimization. More recently, fully human mAbs have being developed using hybridoma technology in transgenic mice models that have integrated into their germline human immunoglobulin (Ig) loci, such as HuMabMouse and XenoMouse platforms (Aires da Silva et al., 2008). Despite all these advances in antibody engineering and transgenic mice methods, the phage display technology has been considered, since its invention in the late 1980s, the most powerful technique for antibody discovery and development. By representing a robust and reliable method to identify specific high-affinity antigen binders from large combinatorial libraries of potentially clinically relevant antibodies, phage display technology has played a key role in the remarkable progress of discovering and optimizing antibodies for diverse applications, particularly antibodybased drugs. Nowadays, there are several antibodies and peptides generated by in vitro phage display currently approved or in advanced clinical stages. However, for more demanding cases aiming to generate best-in-class molecules against difficult targets, conventional in vitro approaches are not sufficient to fulfill unmet needs. Thus, in vivo phage display offers a technology capable of surpassing the drawbacks of the in vitro methods, making it a valuable tool to screen increasingly specific molecules.",

            "text": "The principle underlying display technologies is the ability to physically link phenotypes of polypeptides displayed on a certain platform to their corresponding genotype, which was first shown for phage display [59]. Typically, the phenotype registered in display assays is the physical binging, and it is serially selected [41,186]. Although linking polypeptides to their encoding DNA extends to other functional selection methods, such as the yeast two-hybrid system [47][48][49]187], assays for intracellular interaction are conventionally considered as a separate category. While display scaffolds presenting polypeptides in the library vary, the ability to link an individual polypeptide selected based on its particular properties to the coding nucleic acid (cDNA or mRNA) is the feature that makes it possible to identify, isolate and amplify the desired library members [188]. There are five major display technologies, which have evolved in parallel (Fig. 1). Here, we elaborate on individual display methods, with a special emphasis on filamentous phage display, since this is the major interest of our group. Within the first six months of year 2006 alone, close to 200 publications involving phage display have been published. Such popularity and versatility of phage display puts this technology into a separate category per se. In 1985, Smith, Scott and colleagues established a method for displaying polypeptides on the surface of filamentous M13-derived bacteriophage (phage) [59]. This technique was originally developed to map epitope-binding sites of antibodies by panning random peptide-phage libraries on immobilized immunoglobulins. Since then, phage display has been used as a powerful method to register polypeptide binding with a diverse range of basic biological, as well as technical and medical applications [77,186]. Biology of phage has been well reviewed [189][190][191][192]. In contrast to the lytic bacteriophage species (e.g., T4), filamentous phages replicate and assemble without killing the E. coli host.",

            "text": "Thus, between random peptide and recombinant antibody libraries hinges on the specific needs of the intended application, ensuring optimal results for cholera toxin detection. \n\nIn practical applications, the detection of cholera toxins often involves using fusion proteins formed by coupling random peptides with other proteins, rather than single peptides or phages alone. Multifunctional phage display technology has enabled the development of versatile biosensors based on M13 phage for detection and analysis. Through surface modifications, M13 phage gains new characteristics, such as targeted binding ability, optical properties of quantum dots, and the accumulation of magnetic nanoparticles (171). These modifications make M13 phage an ideal platform for highly sensitive and selective biosensor development in cholera toxins detection, offering improved accuracy and efficiency. In contrast to random peptides, recombinant antibodies possess the advantage of direct fixation on both solid surfaces and antigens. Isolated from libraries, recombinant antibodies like scFvs and anti-idiotype antibodies find applications in sensitive diagnosis techniques such as ELISA, PD-IPCR, and iLAMP. Additionally, recombinant antibodies expand the scope of immunoassay agents, allowing for the detection of diverse biotoxins within the same group. The use of recombinant antibodies has led to simultaneous biotoxin detection based on phage display, showcasing their advantages, including enhanced specificity, increased sensitivity, shorter detection time, and improved safety. Recombinant antibodies represent a potent tool for the sensitive and specific detection of cholera toxins. In the quest for cholera toxin screening, researchers harnessed diverse resources, including antigens for antibody preparation, proteins, and antibody samples for immunomolecular sieving. Antigens, derived from animals, triggered immune responses, resulting in specific antibodies. To enhance affinity, an animal immune repository was utilized, spotlighting antibodies finely tuned to the toxin. Nanobodies, from animals like camels, featured compact size, stability, and genetic manipulability, becoming potent alternatives to conventional antibodies. Nanobodies played crucial roles, particularly in targeted antibody selection, mimicking toxin epitopes for precise immune analyses, thus serving as high-affinity substitutes. This integrated approach supported effective cholera toxin detection and analysis (172).",

They are the most profitable single product class, where they represent six of the top ten selling drugs. At the beginning of the 1990s, an in vitro antibody selection technology known as antibody phage display was developed by John McCafferty and Sir. Gregory Winter that enabled the discovery of human antibodies for diverse applications, particularly antibody-based drugs. They created combinatorial antibody libraries on filamentous phage to be utilized for generating antigen specific antibodies in a matter of weeks. Since then, more than 70 phage\u2013derived antibodies entered clinical studies and 14 of them have been approved.

Besides, M13 filamentous phages, which have \u223c2700 copies of the 5 kD major pVIII coat protein, can provide great signal amplification when using reporter-conjugated anti-M13 pVIII antibodies. Various studies have shown that M13 phages are valuable reporter elements for use in ELISAs (Goldman, Anderson, Bernstein, & Swain, 2010). In addition, for increasing sensitivity, chemiluminescence has been employed to combine phage-displayed nanobodies, HRP-conjugated anti-M13 pVIII antibodies and chemiluminescent substrates. In further studies, phages could be directly conjugated to a fluorescent dye or other label to improve the detection sensitivity and shorten the procedure.

            "text": "Applications of phage display that have surfaced lately reflect the potential that phage display technology represents. An example of integration of phage display with advanced biotechniques is the use of real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to facilitate identification of cell-and tissue-specific peptides. Quantitative PCR allows to quantify numbers of library clones bound to cells of interest, which was demonstrated for selections on live cells and on formalin-fixed, paraffinembedded tissue sections [259,260]. Real-time PCR was also adopted to monitor the changes in phage binding to cardiac vascular epitopes upon aging [261]. A method with potential for clinical diagnostics is phage display-mediated immuno-PCR (PD-IPCR), which is a modification of immuno-PCR (IPCR) performed with a recombinant phage particle instead of a monoclonal antibody [262]. In PD-IPCR, the phage-displayed scFv and the encoding phage DNA combine the detection and the template units. The sensitivity of this assay is a 1,000-fold over that achieved with conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). \n\nAnother recent illustration of the progress resulting from co-evolving technologies is the combination of phage display with laser capture microdissection (LCM) used to isolate cells of specific origin from sections of complex heterogeneous tissues such as biopsies or autopsies [260,[263][264][265]. Recovery of phage binding to cells of interest was successfully assisted by LCM in mice after in vivo library administration [260], as well as after ex vivo application of phage to freshly collected oral squamous cell carcinomas [263]. Also, fluorochrome labeling of phage in display libraries has been introduced as a method for studying binding specificities, as well as phage display applications in flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy [198,266]. \n\nCombination of enzymatic assays with phage display technology has been useful in identification of peptides with a functional property of interest, such as enzyme substrates [71,179,267]. Similar approaches have been undertaken to the identification of peptides with inhibitory properties.",

            "text": "for antibody discovery, in 1990, antibody phage display technology was developed as an application of the filamentous fusion phage (74). In this case, the genetic sequences of the immunoglobulin variable domains (single-chain variable fragments, scFvs) were fused with the DNA sequence of the phage gene III, allowing the variable domains to be expressed on the surface of fd bacteriophages, thereby conveniently linking genotype with phenotype through the phage. When an antigen of interest is available, antibody phage display technology enables the selection and isolation of high affinity scFv binders (74). Since its development and until now, the construction of large na\u00efve, immune, synthetic, and semi-synthetic libraries as a source of antibodies, of animal or human origin, has positioned antibody phage display technology as an extremely powerful tool for high-throughput antibody discovery (75). To date, more than 10 monoclonal antibodies derived from phage display experiments have successfully entered the market for a diverse range of therapeutic indications. Of these, it is worth highlighting the first approved fully human antibody (adalimumab), which is an anti-TNF-\u03b1 antibody for treating rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory diseases and remains the top selling pharmaceutical of the global market (76).\n\nIn 1993, Hamers-Casterman et al. reported the discovery of heavy-chain only antibodies (HCAbs), which are naturally present in camelids (i.e., camels, llamas, dromedaries, and alpacas) (77). Later on, further research confirmed that the variable domain of these antibodies (V H H) alone, with a size of about 12-15 kDa, is still functional, turning it into the smallest antibody fragment with antigen binding capacity (78). Notably, these single-domain antibodies (also known as nanobodies) possess important structural differences in the antigen binding region compared to conventional antibodies, which may provide them with an ability to recognize cryptic (hidden) epitopes (79). Due to their specific antigen binding capacity, together with their high solubility, stability, and ability to penetrate rapidly into deep tissue, among other favorable characteristics (78), several therapeutic candidates based on single-",

            "text": "Immunohistochemistry is a widely used technique for research and diagnostic purposes that relies on the recognition by antibodies of antigens expressed in tissues. However, tissue processing and particularly formalin fixation affect the conformation of these antigens through the formation of methylene bridges. Although antigen retrieval techniques can partially restore antigen immunoreactivity, it is difficult to identify antibodies that can recognize their target especially in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues. Most of the antibodies currently used in immunohistochemistry have been obtained by animal immunization; however, in vitro display techniques represent alternative strategies that have not been fully explored yet. This review provides an overview of phage display-based antibody selections using na\u00efve antibody libraries on various supports (fixed cells, dissociated tissues, tissue fragments, and tissue sections) that have led to the identification of antibodies suitable for immunohistochemistry.",

Such successes have been responsible for spawning a range of biotechnology companies, as well as many complementary technologies devised to expedite the drug discovery process and resolve bottlenecks in the discovery workflow. Areas covered In this perspective, the authors summarize the application of phage display for drug discovery and provide examples of protein-based drugs that have either been approved or are being developed in the clinic. The amenability of phage display to generate functional protein molecules to challenging targets and recent developments of strategies and techniques designed to harness the power of sampling diverse repertoires are highlighted. Expert opinion Phage display is now routinely combined with cutting-edge technologies to deep-mine antibody-based repertoires, peptide, or alternative scaffold libraries generating a wealth of data that can be leveraged, e.g. via artificial intelligence, to enable the potential for clinical success in the discovery and development of protein-based therapeutics.",

However, due to the speed and ease with which further selections and screening could be performed, we were able to identify an additional 109 functional scFvs from other cell lines. In total, this approach identified six targets: EGFR, B-CAM, CD44, CD73, CD71 and HER2. All of these have previously been implicated in cancer progression, with the least validation associated with CD73 [13,14]. It must be noted that the MDA-MB-231 cell line is described as HER2 negative, and it does not amplify or overexpress HER2. However, it does have a basal level of HER2 expression [15] that could be sufficient to illicit a functional response. Hence, direct cell panning on MDA-MB-231 cells failed to identify anti-HER2 antibodies; however, when antibodies were screened, which had been isolated against other cell types; internalising anti-HER2 antibodies were identified. This highlights the advantages of not restricting a screen to those antibodies that have only been isolated against the test cell type.\n\nThe success rate of immunoprecipitation using the phage-display antibodies was low, with only 1 of the final 9 antibodies able to immunoprecipitate a specific target, CD73. This is most probably due to the relatively low affinity as these antibodies were isolated from a na\u00efve library. Target identification success rate was increased by performing ELISAs against known targets and could be improved further by incorporating cDNA-based target identification methods. However, even without affinity maturation and further development this study also demonstrates that an antibody derived from this phage display-based approach can be used to validate an identified target. The anti-CD73 antibody isolated by phage display demonstrated antitumour activity in a MDA-MB-231 xenograft model and highlights the advantage that isolating a target and an antibody together can accelerate the early validation of that target in a disease relevant setting. This can be illustrated further by using CD73 as an example. In 1991, Kruger",

Phage display has been successfully used for isolation of many mAbs currently sold in the market. However, the main drawback is that it could result in a large number of false positives. In this study, we explored the feasibility of combination of two powerful antibody isolation techniques, phage display and Functional Ligand-binding Identification by Tat-based Recognition of Associating Proteins (FLI-TRAP), to identify nanobodies (Nbs) that are specific to HBsAg, an antigen commonly used for hepatitis B infection diagnostics. A synthetic camelized human nanobody library was subjected to 2 rounds of biopanning against HBsAg adr subtype, commonly found in southeast Asia. As expected, sequencing analysis of all 12 randomly selected clones from biopanning showed truncated Nbs, representing false positive. Full-length Nb genes were amplified from the phage eluted during the 2nd round of biopanning was subcloned into FLI-TRAP system for isolation. For evaluation, 16 clones were also randomly picked and submitted for sequencing analysis. Interestingly, 15 out of 16 clones had the same sequence and were full-length Nb, so C1 was used to represent these clones. C10, however, was truncated at framework 3. ELISA result of crude extract showed that C1 showed binding activity \u2248 4.5 fold higher than reference Nb and \u2248 1.46 fold lower than commercial purified monoclonal antibodies while its WB result showed that C1 had a higher protein yield than the reference Nb. C10 did not show ELISA signal nor was detected in WB, thus truncation was confirmed since the detection was performed using anti-FLAG antibody specific to FLAG epitope tag fused to the C-terminus of Nb. Nonetheless, our study demonstrated the feasibility to use FLI-TRAP after initial phage display screening to easily identify full-length Nbs. This combined platform would be powerful tool for easy isolation of Nb against new target as well as for affinity maturation.",

            "text": "they did not investigate the specificity and functionality of the phage display-selected antibodies. 14 In our study, we used long-read sequencing to expand the screening of selected phage display libraries. This combination not only provides additional knowledge on the antibody repertoire of immunized animals but greatly enhances the screening power of immune phage display libraries for the identification of functional and diverse scFv fragments. As 5% of the immunoglobulin repertoire in rodents expresses the lambda light chain, we have considered the kappa chain locus only. 31 We analyzed data from two immune libraries against CD160 and CD123 based on HCDR3 abundance within the enriched libraries, and selected clones either based on frequency or phylogenetic distance to allow the isolation of more diverse binders. An interesting observation was that not all clones enriched by phage display panning bound to target antigen, but we observed a success rate of 75% and 81% when we analyzed the most frequent clones prevalent after CD160 and CD123 selection, respectively. This strategy consists of conventional phage display biopanning followed by SMRT sequencing and open source NGS analysis to identify an expansive repertoire of antigen-specific antibody clones, with virtually no screening required. A disadvantage of the system deployed here, relative to second-generation systems such as the Illumina platform, is the far lower sequencing depth obtained. Typically yields of 80,000 reads for a 1 Kb sequence fragment can be generated, as compared to over 5 \u00d7 10 6 reads for Illumina Hiseq sequencing. Clearly, the read depths obtained in our experiments were insufficient to cover the theoretical diversity of a typical phage display library. It is possible to modify the sequencing protocol by sequencing the same prepared library on multiple SMRT cells of the sequencer. As library preparation and instrument run time are a substantial proportion of the sequencing cost, this approach could enable sequencing depth to be increased 10-fold with a modest increase in sequencing costs. For the purpose of this study and using an approach in which libraries are first enriched against target antigen, we surmise that depth of sequencing obtained in a single run is sufficient to sample our immune scFv phage display libraries, which typically have reduced diversity and clonal redundancy. This is clearly the case for libraries after multiple rounds of enrichment. However, for libraries on which limited enrichment have",

            "text": "Phage display is a nanotechnology with limitless potential, first developed in 1985 and still awaiting to reach its peak. Awarded in 2018 with the Nobel Prize for Chemistry, the method allows the isolation of high-affinity ligands for diverse substrates, ranging from recombinant proteins to cells, organs, even whole organisms. Personalized therapeutic approaches, particularly in oncology, depend on the identification of new, unique, and functional targets that phage display, through its various declinations, can certainly provide. A fast-evolving branch in cancer research, immunotherapy is now experiencing a second youth after being overlooked for years; indeed, many reports support the concept of immunotherapy as the only non-surgical cure for cancer, at least in some settings. In this review, we describe literature reports on the application of peptide phage display to cancer immunotherapy. In particular, we discuss three main outcomes of this procedure: (i) phage display-derived peptides that mimic cancer antigens (mimotopes) and (ii) antigen-carrying phage particles, both as prophylactic and/or therapeutic vaccines, and (iii) phage display-derived peptides as small-molecule effectors of immune cell functions. Preclinical studies demonstrate the efficacy and vast potential of these nanosized tools, and their clinical application is on the way.",

(2024) 19 (9), 811-824 ISSN 1746-0913 811 10.2217/fmb-2023-0246 C 2024 The Authors routes, including water, food, air and clinical settings. Phage therapeutics has emerged as a highly debated and explored topic, with the fundamental understanding of phage biology, its life cycle, and interactions with host bacteria shedding light on its potential as a bio-probe or assay [7,8]. This potential holds promise in addressing persistent challenges associated with infections, whether they are foodborne, airborne, waterborne or clinical in nature. The inherent qualities of phages, such as their self-replicating ability and host-specific nature, position them as a valuable tool in combating these infectious threats [9,10]. Phage-based diagnostics offer a captivating aspect of achieving unparalleled levels of specificity and sensitivity while minimizing both cost and time requirements. The ingenious utilization of the phage display technique further enhances the diagnostic potential [11]. This technique involves the incorporation of a protein of interest into the phage coat protein, resulting in the external display of the protein. This connection between genotype and phenotype showcases the fusion of genetic information with observable characteristics. By exploiting this technique, phage-based diagnostics can leverage the unique properties of phages to precisely target and identify specific pathogens or molecules of interest [11,12]. This approach promises to revolutionize the field of diagnostics by providing a powerful tool that combines the advantages of phage biology with the precision of molecular recognition, ultimately enhancing our ability to detect and diagnose a wide range of infections and diseases [13]. Phage display platforms offer a versatile approach for screening phages against a variety of DNA sequences, peptides and proteins [10,14]. This technique involves the presentation of diverse peptides or proteins on the surface of phages, which can then be subjected to interactions with specific target entities. By measuring the interactions between these displayed proteins and the desired targets, researchers can gain valuable insights into molecular binding, recognition, and potential applications.",

            "text": "Moreover, the phage display method is highly sensitive, enabling the detection of low-abundance antigens (7). In 2003, Weber et al. isolated B cells from a small amount of patient blood to generate the scFvs libraries by the phage display technology, and obtained the four anti-Scl-70 scFvs through phage screening (8). In contrast with these demerits on the use of native human antibodies, humanized monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) can reduce heterologous interference of mouse antibodies and also have several advantages, such as high specificity and affinity, small inter-batch difference, and easy industrial mass production (9). Humanized mAb improves the structure of traditional antibodies, making their application more targeted, functional, and operational, with the ability to achieve many functions that traditional antibodies cannot (10). However, a humanized anti-Scl-70 antibody substitute for positive patient serum has not been reported yet. \n\nIn this study, three anti-Scl-70 humanized antibodies from murine were characterized as specific, sensitive, and easily available artificial substitute for positive reference of SSc diagnosis. Physicochemical properties, three-dimensional structural basis, and electrostatic potential distribution of the protein surface of scFv were evaluated. The findings of this study are expected to provide scientific basis for enhanced SSc diagnostic method development.",

Fully human mAbs, carrying no xenogenic components and displaying most preferable pharmacokinetic profiles, have emerged as the fastest-growing group of therapeutic antibodies entering clinical trials. 1,2 Since the first report of the production of a mouse mAb through employment of B cell hybridoma fusion techniques, 3 several powerful technologies for the generation of entirely human antibodies have been developed. 4,5 These include noncombinatorial methodologies for the efficient immortalization of human B cells, 6,7 the generation of stable human hybridomas, 8 and expression-cloning of physiological variable (V) gene pairings from blood-derived human B cells of infected individuals. 9 The vast majority of clinically-investigated fully human mAbs, however, are produced by either immunization of transgenic mice that are equipped with the human antibody gene repertoire, 10,11 or by preparing human antibody phage display libraries. In the latter approach, random pairs of the variable genes of the heavy and light antibody chains (VH and VL, respectively) are cloned as combinatorial libraries involving bacteriophages for presentation of selectable antibody fragments. 12 Since the initial description of antibody phage display, 13 this technology has evolved into the most successful in vitro selection platform for human antibodies because it is robust, inexpensive, and offers great potential for automation. 14,15 The first fully human phage display-derived mAbs have recently been approved by the FDA for the treatment of rheumatic and chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (adalimumab), systemic lupus erythematosus (belimumab), and inhalational anthrax infection (raxibacumab). Other phage display library-selected mAbs are currently at advanced stages of clinical development and may reach market approval within the next few years. \n\nOver the past 20 years, a plethora of phage-derived antibody libraries have been constructed that differ in design, origin, diversity, and method of generation.

            "text": "Display technologies, such as phage, yeast and ribosome display are important tools in the identification of therapeutic antibodies. 1 In particular, phage display is widely used at several stages of the drug discovery process. Phage library diversity can be derived from na\u00efve human B cells, 2 synthetic engineered antibody sequences 3 or from B cell-rich tissue of immunized animals; 4 libraries generated by the latter method are often referred to as immune phage display libraries. Immune phage display offers several advantages over na\u00efve or synthetic display approaches, increasing the likelihood of isolating stable, high-affinity specific antibodies due to pre-enrichment and in-vivo affinity maturation. 5 Traditional isolation of antibodies from phage display libraries involves multiple rounds of panning followed by screening and sequencing of positive clones. A key limitation when identifying clones is the screening step following enrichment. Selecting clones can be technically challenging and time consuming, and the process is often hampered by dominant clones within the enriched population, which makes it difficult to identify alternative binders with lower representation within the pool.\n\nDespite recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, sequence read length is a limitation in their application to phage display screening. The majority of NGS platform technologies allow a maximum read length of up to 500 base pair (bp), 6 which has extensively been used for the analysis of immunoglobulin (Ig)-repertoires in several species. This length, however, is not sufficient to cover a full singlechain variable fragment (scFv) sequences. 7,8 Currently, sequencing of the entire variable heavy (VH) and variable light (VL) fragment of a single chain is not routinely carried out and is not possible using conventional NGS platforms. Single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing allows the contiguous sequencing of fragments of up to 8500 bp, 9 but read length comes at the expense of sequence fidelity. 10 A recent advance in SMRT sequencing is the addition of hairpin loops to double-stranded DNA fragments. 11 Consensus sequencing of adaptor ligated fragments can increase the sequence accuracy of an 850 bp fragment (the approximate length of an average scFv) to 99.99%. 12 Hemadou et al. first demonstrated this approach to be effective at accurately identifying full-length scFvs in an enriched fully human,",

The V H and V L genes are diversified with random mutagenesis to yield high affinity antibodies (Boder et al. 2000). Other formats including surface display on E. coli and Bacillus strains, retroviral display, display based on protein-DNA linkeage and others have either specific technical disadvantages or are not yet mature enough for commercial use. \n\nPhage display is currently the most popular molecular technology used to tap into the human antibody repertoire (Hoogenboom 2005). As table 1 shows, in vitro and in vivo neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies have been generated against a variety of virus from diverse families by phage display. \n\nAll variable, antigen binding regions of the heavy and light chains, termed V H and V L , are cloned from the lymphocytes of a donor and expressed as single-chain antibodies (V H -V L ) fused to the pIII surface protein of a bacteriophage. The resulting vast repertoire (\"library\") of different antibody carrying phages ideally mirrors the antibody repertoire of the donor. Cloning of all different antigen binding regions is possible because the hypervariable regions which are responsible for antigen specificity (CDRs) are flanked by constant regions (framework regions, FR) which correspond to families of germline antibody genes for which the genetic sequences are available. Because the heavy and light chains are amplified and cloned by two separate PCR reactions, the library also contains pairings not present in the donor lymphocytes, which further increases its size. The antibody phages are incubated with the antigen of interest and specifically binding phages are rescued together with the genetic information coding for the specific antibody gene. Both the cloning and the selection procedure are very powerful, allowing essentially to generate a repertoire of 10 8 -10 9 different molecules and extracting the desired antibody specificity from a single test tube.",

Antibody fragments, mostly singlechain variable fragments (scFv), have been widely used for various targets in biosensing applications where their small size in comparison with the intact IgG can be of advantage. 87 Other common recombinant antibody fragments include the heavychain antibodies (V HH ), also known as nanobodies or singledomain antibodies, which have gained significant attention due to their extraordinary structure that is completely devoid of the light chains. 66,93 Alternatively, short peptides originating from phage-displayed libraries have been introduced as an interesting alternative for the development of new biosensing platforms because of their small size and cost efficiency. Peptides often suffer from a poor or mediocre affinity in comparison with antibodies, which might limit their use in certain applications. Nevertheless, although the interactions of an individual peptide with its target might be weak, stronger binding has been achieved by multivalent display on the phage particles, resulting in significant avidity effects. Various recognition elements have been applied to biosensors in their phage-displayed format, but, on the other hand, once an individual target-specific phage has been identified, the phage itself becomes expendable. After identification, the recognition element thus may also be subcloned into an expression system for large-scale production and different downstream applications. Alternatively, short peptides can also be chemically synthesized via solid-phase peptide synthesis. \n\nRecombinant antibodies and short peptides originating from phage-displayed libraries have been reported in various biosensor applications, most notably in ELISA and surface plasmon resonance (SPR). 1 Furthermore, numerous different phage-based sensing schemes have been published recently using other transduction techniques, for example, fluorescence, Raman, quartz crystal microbalance, magnetoelastic, and electrochemical techniques. In this context, we will introduce a few interesting and recent applications for different kinds of targets (Table 1), but for a comprehensive overview of phagebased biosensors, we refer the reader to recent review articles. 7,91,92,94",

Furthermore, efficient techniques have been established and optimized to design, build, and manipulate the vast antibody fragment-based libraries in order to derive the antibodies of desired characteristics and affinity. Here, we encompass the progress in this rapidly growing field and discuss its application in finding new diagnostics and therapeutic viral targets in veterinary medicine in association with other complementary technologies. \n\nAntibodies are modular protein defense systems possessing a paratope (variable domain), an antigen-binding site located at the upper tips of the \"Y\"-shaped structure.

The desired phage-displayed peptides are separated by binding affinity purification and their sequence is obtained by DNA sequencing of the corresponding phage clones [31,33,34]. Originally developed to display peptides, the phage display method has evolved over the years to present antibodies [35], T-cell receptors, enzymes, proteomes, secretomes, and the so-called alternative affinity scaffolds [36]. Phage display has already proved useful in the selection of functional biomolecules for some of the most challenging targets in the biomedical field. Several phage display-derived peptides were approved by the FDA for the treatment of various diseases [37]. \n\nIn this work, with the use of phage display, we aimed to develop an engineered M13 phage that exposes a new, in vitro-identified Au-binding peptide capable of synthesizing AuNPs overnight under benign conditions. Such phages could be employed for biogenic, bottom-up synthesis and manipulation of gold nanostructures particularly for further biological applications, which have considerable concerns over contamination.",

            "text": "Antibody libraries can be mined for reactivity against a wide range of targets and then to use the recombinant antibodies as reagents for target detection and characterization: this is well-illustrated in the area of proteomics. Ohara and colleagues compared the properties of recombinant Fabs from a library of synthetically diversified human antibodies with polyclonal antisera against the same targets and reported that the Fabs were well-suited to Western blotting and immunohistochemistry (69). Earlier, de Wildt et al. described experiments in which one or two rounds of conventional screening were used to isolate phage from synthetically diversified libraries constructed on single V H and V L frameworks. Clones (up to 12,000) were then picked and gridded out using robotics onto membranes coated with the targets to test their specificity (56). The study demonstrated the capacity of large display libraries to yield antibodies against a wide range of targets and the ability to extract antibodies against minor components of complex mixtures, given appropriate (robotic) methods for identification of the recognition of target. Other investigators have described phage selection using blots prepared from 2-dimensional gels -a use of the proteome itself as the target for extraction of specific antibodies from a library. \n\nFor na\u00efve or synthetically diversified libraries, the diversity of the resource is such that extraction of antibodies against human protein targets (e.g., tumor necrosis factor (2), human chorionic gonadotropin (28)), molecules that are highly conserved amongst eukaryotes and therefore poorly immunogenic (e.g., ubiquitin (56)) or toxic compounds (e.g., doxorubicin (5)) is possible. \n\nAntibodies isolated through phage display can be developed as diagnostic reagents but a more intriguing prospect is their use in construction of microarrays upon which binding of multiple analytes could be detected (40). Phage display is particularly valuable in this area of application because a single, highly diversified resource (the library) can be conveniently mined for antibodies against very many different targets. Some authors have described the use of stringent selection methods to isolate antibodies of very high affinity via phage display (70).",

            "text": "Antibodies against neurotransmitter receptors (glutamate, dopamine, serotonin, and acetylcholine), enzymes (ATP synthase and aldolase), cytoskeletal proteins, and microglia have been described [17][18][19][20]. Their role in the development of Alzheimer's disease is still uncertain and may simply be the result of neuronal death from exposure to autoantigens or may have some contribution to the pathological process [21][22][23]. The characterization of these autoantibodies (aAb), their antigens, and their role in disease may be a means for the development of improved diagnostic tools and the identification of new therapeutic targets. \n\nPhage display (Ph.D.) technology is useful for the identification of peptides or antibodies on the surface of the filamentous M13 bacteriophage capsid. This capsule permits exposure to an extensive diversity of peptides that can bind to various targets and be identified using peptide library techniques. This methodology has been proven useful not only for the selection of peptides that mimic proteins but also for the identification and description of epitopes recognized by antibodies [24,25]. It also allows for the production of the monoclonal antibodies used to treat several diseases, vaccines, and diagnostic tests as well as several uses in nanotechnology [26]. \n\nPhage display findings can be analyzed with different bioinformatic tools: the identification of consensus motifs among selected sequences, the identification of possible targets by linear and conformational (3D structure) comparison with protein databanks, and assessments of their putative epitopes with their degree of antigenicity. This information can be extremely useful for planning experiments, designing drugs, and other applications [27][28][29]. \n\nThe present study identified mimetic peptides of target antigens in the circulating IgG present in the serum of patients with AD. Our use of the phage display technique, together with bioinformatic tools, may represent one of the first evidences of the presence of autoantibodies and their putative epitope mapping, in AD.",

            "text": "To bypass the limitations in polyclonal and monoclonal antibody generation, several groups have turned to in vitro display technologies such as phage display, ribosome display, or yeast display libraries to generate recombinant antibodies. The more recent technologies of yeast and ribosome display are becoming highly established, but phage display is currently the most robust, well characterized, and reliable of these methods. Antibodies derived from these technologies are cloned in microbial hosts and are therefore monoclonal from the start, with their production being easily scaled up. Critically, selection and screening efforts can be directed toward specifi c epitopes or species cross-reactivity and away from polyspecifi c binding. Phage display allows a researcher to do in a single tube what would be unfathomable in traditional hybridoma work: interrogate libraries of millions to tens of billions of antibodies on the basis of their binding specifi cally to a target of interest. \n\nAll of this is possible due to the ingenious concept of \"genotypeto-phenotype linkage,\" which is exemplifi ed by phage display. Phage display was originally described as a rapid method for cloning gene fragments that encode a specifi c protein [ 5 ]. By cloning gene fragments into the genome of a fi lamentous E. coli bacteriophage, Smith et al. were able to generate libraries of gene fusions with the key phage coat protein p3. After transformation into E. coli , the viral replication system packaged the genome (and therefore the cloned gene) into a highly stable complex carrying the gene product on the tip of the phage particle, as a fusion protein with p3 . By subsequently selecting expressed virions on an immobilized antibody with specifi city for a known protein that had been cloned in the phage genome, they were able to show 1000-fold enrichment of the gene product. This set of experiments showed that \"genotypeto-phenotype linkage\" could be achieved and thereby defi ned the basis of all display technologies developed since.",

However, producing an antibody specific to live bacterial pathogens by the classical method of immunizing animals with live pathogens can be impractical. Phage display technology is an effective alternative method to obtain antibodies with the desired specificity against selected antigenic molecules. In this study, we demonstrated the power of a microarray-based technique for obtaining specific phage-derived antibody fragments against Salmonella, an important foodborne pathogen. The selected phage-displayed antibody fragments were subsequently employed to develop a lateral flow test strip assay for the detection of live Salmonella. The test strips showed specificity to Salmonella Enteritidis without cross-reactivity to eight serovars of Salmonella or other bacteria strains. The test strip assay requires 15 min, whereas the conventional biochemical and serological confirmation test requires at least 24 h. The microarray screening technique for specific phage-based binders and the test strip method can be further applied to other foodborne pathogens.",

The addition of phage peptide PvP selectants completed the sandwich assembly and, lastly, a peroxidase-conjugated anti-phage antibody quantified the binding interaction (Figure 3C). In this format, the DPep2\u03a6 and DPep4\u03a6 sandwich ELISAs failed to produce a significant signal over the background; these two peptides likely were incapable of forming a sandwich interaction. However, the DPep3\u03a6 sandwich ELISA returned a sigmoidal binding curve and an EC 50 that is comparable to a previously reported sandwich phage/antibody ELISA with a commercial anti-DJ-1 antibody [36]. At DJ-1 concentrations above 1 \u00b5M, some non-specificity with negative control phage (Neg\u03a6) is observed; however, these high concentrations are unlikely to occur in biofluids. \n\nThe sandwich strep-DPep1/phage ELISA with the panel of interfering antigens-hemoglobin (Hb, HEWL), HSA, E. coli lysate, and BSA-evaluated the specificity improvements with the sandwich assembly (Figure 3D). Since the assay formats (indirect vs. sandwich) are not analogous, the data were normalized to the DJ-1 signal for each assay format. Statistical analysis of these normalized data revealed a substantial and statistically significant enhancement of specificity; the nonspecific Hb and BSA signal dropped significantly in the sandwich format (p < 0.001 and <0.01, respectively). As expected, background binding to HEWL, which has a high pI causing it to bind non-specifically to the phage surface [38], was unaffected by the sandwich format. These data indicate that the PvP selection strategy can yield sandwich binding peptides with improved selectivity compared to the equivalent single phage binding partners. \n\nPvP selections with a Fab phage-displayed library.

The display of the Fab fragment was developed using pDong1/Fab with the help of the KM13 helper phage, which allows specific recovery of antigen-binding phages by protease treatment [19]. For construction of antibody library, the V H and V L genes of antibodies were amplified and their DNA fragments detected at 350-400 bp were considered target genes (Figure 1A). A phage display antibody library with a diversity of 5610 5 was obtained using the phagemid pDong1/Fab. After three rounds of selection, the enrichment of NcSAG1-binding phage was confirmed using an ELISA with original phage library R0 and sublibraries R1, R2, and R3 that were amplified in each step of biopanning. Absorbance at 450 nm in phage ELISA for R0, R1, R2, and R3 phage against rNcSAG1 increased with the increase of biopanning step (Figure 1B), suggesting that three rounds of biopanning enriched the rNcSAG1-specific Fab-phages. Those R0-R3 phage did not bind to BSA as a negative control. \n\nPhages obtained in the third round were used to infect E. coli TG-1 for forming colonies. Ninety-six colonies were picked up, cultivated for forming phage. Two clones A10 and H3 showed strong signal against immobilized rNcSAG1 (Figure 1C). The binding capacity of A10 and H3 Fab-phage was also reconfirmed against rNcSAG1. A10 and H3 clones bound to rNcSAG1 but not to BSA (Figure 1D), suggesting their specificity to rNcSAG1. The KM13 helper phage on which no antibody was displayed was used as a control and did not bind to immobilized NcSAG1.",

            "text": "The identification of marker molecules specific for blood and lymphatic endothelium may provide new diagnostic tools and identify new targets for therapy of immune, microvascular and cancerous diseases. Here, we used a phage display library expressing human randomized single-chain Fv (scFv) antibodies for direct panning against live cultures of blood (BECs) and lymphatic (LECs) endothelial cells in solution. After six panning rounds, out of 944 sequenced antibody clones, we retrieved 166 unique/diverse scFv fragments, as indicated by the V-region sequences. Specificities of these phage clone antibodies for respective compartments were individually tested by direct cell ELISA, indicating that mainly pan-endothelial cell (EC) binders had been selected, but also revealing a subset of BEC-specific scFv antibodies. The specific staining pattern was recapitulated by twelve phage-independently expressed scFv antibodies. Binding capacity to BECs and LECs and differential staining of BEC versus LEC by a subset of eight scFv antibodies was confirmed by immunofluorescence staining. As one antigen, CD146 was identified by immunoprecipitation with phage-independent scFv fragment. This antibody, B6-11, specifically bound to recombinant CD146, and to native CD146 expressed by BECs, melanoma cells and blood vessels. Further, binding capacity of B6-11 to CD146 was fully retained after fusion to a mouse Fc portion, which enabled eukaryotic cell expression. Beyond visualization and diagnosis, this antibody might be used as a functional tool. Overall, our approach provided a method to select antibodies specific for endothelial surface determinants in their native configuration. We successfully selected antibodies that bind to antigens expressed on the human endothelial cell surfaces in situ, showing that BECs and LECs share a majority of surface antigens, which is complemented by cell-type specific, unique markers.",

            "text": "Simple Summary Monoclonal antibodies are increasingly used for a broad range of diseases. Rising demand must face with time time-consuming and laborious processes to isolate novel monoclonal antibodies. Next-generation sequencing coupled to phage display provides timely and sustainable high throughput selection strategy to rapidly access novel target. Here, we describe the current NGS-guided strategies to identify potential binders from enriched sub-libraires by applying a user-friendly informatic pipeline to identify and discard false positive clones. Rescue step and strategies to boost mAb yield are also discussed to improve the limiting selection and screening steps. Abstract Monoclonal antibodies are among the most powerful therapeutics in modern medicine. Since the approval of the first therapeutic antibody in 1986, monoclonal antibodies keep holding great expectations for application in a range of clinical indications, highlighting the need to provide timely and sustainable access to powerful screening options. However, their application in the past has been limited by time-consuming and expensive steps of discovery and production. The screening of antibody repertoires is a laborious step; however, the implementation of next-generation sequencing-guided screening of single-chain antibody fragments has now largely overcome this issue. This review provides a detailed overview of the current strategies for the identification of monoclonal antibodies from phage display-based libraries. We also discuss the challenges and the possible solutions to improve the limiting selection and screening steps, in order to keep pace with the increasing demand for monoclonal antibodies.",

            "text": "Phage display can be regarded as one of the first extensively developed and utilized foreign protein display systems harnessing the prolific self-assembling process of the bacteriophage and its defined surface protein architecture (Smith, 1985;Gao et al., 2010;Rakonjac et al., 2010). Most widely used is Escherichia coli phage M13 but also l and T7 (Benhar, 2001). Affinity screening of phage display libraries is also called 'biopanning' (Parmley and Smith, 1988). In several rounds of panning the engineered phage particles are incubated with the ligand of interest, which is immobilized on a solid support material. Several washes are performed to exclude unspecific binding, followed by elution of the bound particles (Rakonjac et al., 2010). Phage display systems are especially applied to combinatorial approaches and are the main tool for the isolation and engineering of recombinant antibodies (Benhar, 2001). Recombinant antibody display started with the fusion of the variable region of a single-chain antibody (scFv) fragment to the amino terminus of the phage minor coat protein III (McCaffterty et al., 1990). A following successful application has been the isolation of monoclonal antibodies using phage display and library screening (Winter et al., 1994). In recent years techniques were optimized allowing now design and construction of large libraries of screening targets but especially antibodies (Hoogenboom et al., 1998). For most phages purification is easy and largescale production is inexpensive; therefore, phage display has also been considered for protein or antibody purification (Clark and March, 2006). Phage display is a very versatile technology, e.g. a treatment against cocaine addiction is based on phage display technology. Nasally delivered whole phage particles displaying a specific cocaine-sequestering antibody can enter the central nervous system and bind to cocaine molecules, thus inhibiting their action on the brain (Dickerson et al., 2005).\n\nOne of the main characteristics of bacteriophages is their specificity for the bacterial host. Using this natural affinity, phages have been used for the detection and genotyping of",

            "text": "The notion of phage exhibit was introduced via the pioneering work of Smith (1985), who proposed a reputable method for presenting foreign polypeptides on the surface of filamentous phage of E. coli. Since then, phage display technology based on these lysogenicphages (e.g., M13, f1, or fd) has developed into a broadly used technique for selecting peptides and proteins with preferred functions and properties from molecular libraries (Paschke, 2006). \n\nIn phage display, exogenous DNA is fused with phage coat protein genes, and the desired foreign protein is expressed as part of the relevant coat proteins and are thus \"displayed\" on the surface of the mature virion as a fusion protein. The remaining unbound or weakly-bound phages are washed off, whereas the bound phages are eluted and amplified by bacterial reinfection. Repeated rounds of biopanning (usually 3-5) lead to rapid identification of phage clones displaying peptides with the highest affinity (via DNA sequencing) (Aghebati-Maleki et al., 2016). This approach has led to the development of Phage Antibody technology where antibody-derived peptides are displayed by fusion to phage coat proteins. The most significant advance provided by this method is that there is no need for the target ligand to be immunoreactive in a given host and toxic molecules can be used as the target ligand (Rees and Loessner, 2005). \n\nIn general, this sort of knowledge has been used for medical or pharmaceutical applications, with the phage display system being used exclusively to recognize a peptide with the preferred binding character (Sidhu, 2000). These peptides can be used as therapeutic agents by inhibiting receptor-ligand interaction or acting as agonist. Dickerson et al. (2005) treated cocaine addiction in a rodent model via phage display of \"cocainesequestering antibodies\". These phage particles have the capacity to penetrate the central nervous system and sequester cocaine, thereby attenuating its psychoactive",

To avoid the confounding effects that may occur when screening as 'antibody-displayed on phage' format as observed with the scFv library, the Fab library clones were screened as soluble Fab antibodies. In addition, due to possible domination of the pan by a few clones as observed in the scFv library screen, a greater number of clones (~400) were picked for the Humanyx library screen in order to identify more unique clones. The Fab libraries contained a high percentage of positive clones, 22% for PA and 60% for Etox (Fig. 3B). In order to highlight duplicate clones, BstN1 digestion was carried out to identify unique restriction fragment length patterns. The Fab sequences were subsequently confirmed by DNA sequencing. The panning against Etox yielded 16 unique clones; while the panning against PA yielded 17 unique clones, all of which were functional as soluble Fab (Fig. 3B). \n\nIn order to demonstrate the suitability of the Humanyx library-derived antibodies for diagnostic assays, six anti-PA antibodies (PA21,39,38,53,64,and 71) and five anti-Etox antibodies (ET21,22,24,27,and 62) were selected for further evaluation in a typical diagnostic ELISA. These clones were chosen for their high binding affinity as observed on a preliminary Fab-vs-Phage sandwich screen, as well as their sequence diversity so as to ensure diverse antigenic binding sites. These clones were converted and expressed as full-length recombinant IgG for increased avidity. All antibodies retained their high affinity and specificity on direct binding ELISA to their target antigen on conversion from Fab to IgG (Fig. 3C).",

            "text": "The phage display technique has been widely used to engineer the scFv antibody in various applications such as research, diagnostics, and therapeutic applications, and it offers several advantages over the hybridoma technology. In this technique, phages are constructed easily and cheaply by directly infecting E. coli (Wang et al. 1995), and these phages are more stable and can be stored at 4 \u00b0C for several years (Burritt et al. 1996). This study is the first to successfully clone and express the phage scFv library against FgCathL1H. The spleen of an immunized mouse was removed for the development of novel functional combinatorial antibodies that were expressed on the surface of bacteriophages. In previous studies, the scFv fragment of anti-F. hepatica cathepsin was generated from spleen cells (naive mouse) using phage techniques (Norbury et al. 2019b). The scFv fragment was ligated into the pCOMB3X phagemid vector and transformed into competent E. coli XL1-Blue cells. In other studies (Zhu et al. 2013), the scFv was produced from the hybridoma cell 6E6 that secretes the monoclonal antibody against the S protein of the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus. Moreover, the vector pGEX-6p-1 with a GST tag was used to generate rMoAbs and was expressed in E. coli using prokaryotic expression. When this study was compared with previous studies, it was evident that the phage display technique is a flexible method for creating antibodies against various targets, from viral proteins to parasitic antigens (such as F. hepatica and F. gigantica). This study also highlights the potential of the phage display technique to develop antibodies for diagnosing neglected tropical diseases, which have been often overlooked in antibody development. Several factors can affect the performance of the ScFv as a diagnostic antibody, including interference from host serum factors (e.g., serum proteins), its own stability (temperature, pH, storage conditions), and its binding affinity and specificity to the target antigen.",

            "text": "The discovery and development of therapeutic drugs and diagnostic probes are a time-consuming, expensive, and complex process. The processes involve experts from a wide range of disciplines such as medicinal chemistry, biochemistry, molecular biology, medicine, and pharmacology. It has been estimated that from about 10,000 new chemical entities identified, only one will reach the market in an average time of 16 years. Phage display, and particularly peptide phage display, has played a major role in the development pipeline for bringing peptide therapeutics into the clinic. Phage-derived peptides play an important role in disease detection and therapy, including in clinical imaging. The potential of peptides in preclinical and clinical molecular imaging is tremendous. Molecular imaging offers invaluable opportunities to explore complex disease-related biological processes at the molecular level in vivo. The emergence of current molecular imaging technologies is dependent not only on the progress of imaging systems but, more importantly, also on molecular imaging probes. Peptide-based imaging has now become an established approach in nuclear imaging, and its application is expanding to other imaging modalities. Considering the emergence of novel library designs and innovative selection strategies, we are confident that phage-derived peptides will continue to be promising biomarkers for early cancer detection, in metabolic abnormalities, and in personalized medicine. \n\n\u00a9 2019 The Author(s).

            "text": "In addition to these in vitro techniques, phage library approaches with in vivo binding modalities have also been explored. First described for organ targeting using peptide phage libraries where the library was injected intravenously into mice and the phage were subsequently rescued from the brain and kidneys (64), the technique has also been successfully carried out in tumour-bearing mice (65). In recent years, similar methodologies have also been employed with antibody phage libraries not only to identify potentially therapeutic antibodies but also for determining the accessibility of a given target (66), further expanding the boundaries of phage display technology. \n\nToday, almost all widely accessible commercial libraries are based on non-immune repertoires of high complexity to enable use in the selection of antibodies against a virtually unlimited number of target antigens. The latest state-of-art libraries reach complexities of up to 10 11 -10 12 clones and thus may even exceed the size of individual human cell repertoires (67,68). While high-affinity antibodies can be isolated from these libraries, occasionally the affinity of the obtained antibodies is low as the genes are obtained from naive B cells that have not yet undergone affinity maturation. In such cases, where the affinity required for therapeutic efficacy is higher than that of the antibody obtained, in vitro affinity maturation may be performed. This is often accomplished by introducing random or specific mutations in the CDRs or the exchange of whole heavy or light chain domains by chain shuffling (69)(70)(71)(72)(73). Recently, Li et al. described an alternative phage display approach for affinity maturation of a natural human antibody MSL-109 targeting human cytomegalovirus (CMV), where each of the CDRs was allowed to vary in only one amino acid residue at a time (69). Higher affinity antibodies were isolated which had improved CMV neutralization potency when expressed as Fab fragments in bacterial cells. \n\nIn another novel application of in vitro phage library screening, single antibodies capable of dual epitope recognition have also been developed.",

            "text": "This review has considered the phage display of Fabs, scFvs and nanobodies. With potential application to all recombinant antibody library types are the recent improvement in library design and display efficiency. The diversity within the CDR regions can now be designed with considerable accuracy by using trimer phosphoramidine codons to mimic natural amino acid usage [52]. Furthermore, improvements have been made in reducing cloning errors due to the presence of linker repeat regions [49]. Both advances will facilitate the optimal cloning of diversity into libraries in the future. The co-expression of chaperones and isomerases [34,36] as well as the use of the co-translation secretion pathway with optimised signal sequences [25] can significantly improve antibody phage display efficiency, thereby improving the efficiency of isolating binders. These same strategies also improve soluble antibody expression levels. Furthermore, the identification and use of highly stable Fabs and scFvs as scaffold for the introduction of synthetic diversity have improved expression and stability of the resulting antibody fragments [31,32,50,66]. The combined use of these strategies to yield higher expression levels and increased stability has the potential to produce more efficient phage display of antibodies and therefore improve panning efficacy. They should also produce more useful reagents. \n\nMethods suitable for the batch reformatting of both Fabs and scFvs into IgGs for high-level expression in mammalian cell culture are now also described [26,27,58,59]. These will facilitate the efficient cloning of sub-libraries of antibody fragments from panning experiments to allow them to be screened as IgGs. This has previously been a bottleneck in developing therapeutics from phage display libraries, as the monovalent recombinant antibody fragments often have very different properties to their concomitant divalent IgGs. \n\nNanobodies from both camelids and sharks are readily amenable to the production of simple, high diversity phage display libraries [18,19]. They provide small antibodies with very high stability, therefore potentially offering unique properties for diagnostic or even therapeutic applications.",

We first selected rabbit antibodies that bind to a cell surface epitope of human A33 antigen with an affinity in the 1 nm range. For rabbit antibody humanization, we then used a selection strategy that combines grafting of the complementarity determining regions with framework fine tuning. The resulting humanized antibodies were found to retain both high specificity and affinity for human A33 antigen.",

            "text": "The polyclonal antibodies purified from the serum of an immunized animal (mouse, rabbit, goat, lama, etc.) and mAb secreted by immortalized B cells from the spleen of an immunized animal are commonly used in immunological assays. Their dominant role in immunochemical applications faded after the appearance of phage-displayed antibodies, which are currently commonly used for the discovery and detection of cancer-specific antigens and biomarkers [28,30,76,77]. To isolate antibodies with the desired specificities, phage library selections must be performed on tumor-derived antigen sources. For example, the phage display strategy for the selection of rabbit monoclonal antibodies that recognize PC tumor-associated antigens was reported by Mikhail Popkov et al. [77]. Researchers immunized rabbits with either human PC cell line LNCap or DU145. Chimeric rabbit/human Fab libraries were generated through the oligo(dT)-primed, reverse transcription of RNA from the animal's spleen and bone marrow [78]. The antibody variable domains VL and VH were amplified, fused to human constant domains CL and CH1, and cloned into the phagemid vector pComb3X. Constructed in this way, phage-displayed chimeric rabbit/human Fab libraries were screened against human PC cells DU145 using a novel whole-cell panning protocol, resulting in the discovery of clones bound selectively to DU145 cells but not to primary human prostate epithelial cell line PrEC, as detected by flow cytometry. In summary, this work first demonstrated the potential of immune antibody libraries in the identification of imaging phage probes interacting with tumor-associated cell-surface antigens.

            "text": "Screening phage display libraries is a powerful tool for identifying specific binders from libraries that contain a large diversity of targets [33,208]. Library construction is achieved by splicing a repertoire of genes (genotype) that encodes the peptide into a gene that encodes a capsid structural protein (phenotype). The \"displayed\" peptides are included in the capsid layer on the phage surface. Ideally, these proteins should not interfere with the phage structure [209]. \n\nRecombinant DNA technology has enabled phage library construction whereby billions of variant peptides and proteins are able to be presented on the surface of the phage [210,211]. From this diversity library, binders specific to proteins of interest with high affinity can be selected by biopanning. This technique facilitates understanding of protein-ligand interactions [212], antigen-antibody interactions [213,214], and permits improvement of the affinity of proteins to their binding partner [215,216]. For instance, phage display antibody libraries with diversities as high as 10 10 can be established using display technology [217,218]. Recently, surface display technology has expanded to include ribosome display [219], yeast surface display [220], and mammalian cell display [221]. Such technologies have enabled the exploration of new antibodies that may not otherwise have been discovered, from humans and animals including shark, camel, llama, and lamprey [222][223][224][225]. \n\nAntibody phage display libraries have been used extensively for isolation of high-affinity specific binders against unique antigens from different targets [226][227][228][229][230]. Three types of antibody libraries are typically constructed: na\u00efve, synthetic, and immunized libraries [231]. A na\u00efve antibody library refers to the repertoire of antibody genes derived from non-immunized donors. Synthetic antibody libraries are constructed using synthesized V-gene fragments with randomized CDRs, whereas immunized libraries are based on a host immunized with the target antigen of the disease [232]. The principle of the phage display is represented in Figure 2, indicating the workflows of library construction, biopanning, and clone screening prior to protein expression and purification for functional assays.",

No significant difference, within one standard deviation, was detected in affinity for digoxin when the phage-displayed scFv was compared to either its soluble scFv form or the purified antibody. In addition, no change in binding specificity was detected, within two standard deviations, when the binding proteins were challenged with two commonly cross-reactive compounds (dihydrodigoxin and digitoxin).

Using the Ion Torrent NGS platform, they found 12 Fabs against Notch-1, and 2 Fabs showed strict specificity for Notch-1 with very high affinities. \n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is also increasingly applied in phage display studies. He et al. used NGS with phage display and a lot of peptides were obtained from the Ph.D.-12 Phage Display Peptide Library panning against PD-L1. Based on the NGS data obtained, they further adopted different sequence features and various machine-learning methods to train models for predicting PD-L1 binders. Finally, PDL1Binder, an ensemble computational model, was implemented as a web server. Liu et al. studied the sequence features of phage proteins and nonphage proteins. They proposed a feature selection method based on ensemble learning. Their findings might help to find out new phages from metagenomes, providing candidate genes or vectors for new phage library construction. \n\nIn addition to NGS and AI, relevant scholars have been trying to improve the phage display technique and explore its application from different aspects. In the review by Andr\u00e9 et al., the state-of-the-art in vivo phage display methodologies were summarized and discussed, especially the promising emerging selection strategy for improving antibody targeting and drug delivery properties. Allen et al. reviewed how bioconjugation and the incorporation of non-canonical amino acids had expanded the chemical diversity of peptides and proteins displayed by M13 phage virions for a variety of purposes. Ma et al. developed and compared three different methods to increase the signal-to-background ratio of ELISA assay during biopanning, which might help probe the weak protein-protein interactions using phage display. Thavorasak et al. applied phage display to reveal the enhancing epitope on the spike protein of the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), which would be helpful and useful in designing a safe and effective PEDV vaccine devoid of the enhancing epitope.",

            "text": "Combinatorial biology methods offer a good solution for targeting interactions of specif ic molecules by a high-throughput screening and are widely used for drug development, diagnostics, identif ication of novel monoclonal antibodies, search for linear peptide mimetics of discontinuous epitopes for the development of immunogens or vaccine components. Among all currently available techniques, phage display remains one of the most popular approaches. Despite being a fairly old method, phage display is still widely used for studying protein-protein, peptide-protein and DNA-protein interactions due to its relative simplicity and versatility. Phage display allows highly representative libraries of peptides, proteins or their fragments to be created. Each phage particle in a library displays peptides or proteins fused to its coat protein and simultaneously carries the DNA sequence encoding the displayed peptide/protein in its genome. The biopanning procedure allows isolation of specif ic clones for almost any target, and due to the physical link between the genotype and the phenotype of recombinant phage particles it is possible to determine the structure of selected molecules. Phage display technology continues to play an important role in HIV research. A major obstacle to the development of an effective HIV vaccine is an extensive genetic and antigenic variability of the virus. According to recent data, in order to provide protection against HIV infection, the so-called broadly neutralizing antibodies that are cross-reactive against multiple viral strains of HIV must be induced, which makes the identif ication of such antibodies a key area of HIV vaccinology. In this review, we discuss the use of phage display as a tool for identif ication of HIV-specif ic antibodies with broad neutralizing activity. We provide an outline of phage display technology, brief ly describe the design of antibody phage libraries and the affinity selection procedure, and discuss the biology of HIV-1-specif ic broadly neutralizing antibodies. Finally, we summarize the studies aimed at identif ication of broadly neutralizing antibodies using various types of phage libraries.",

One of the major drawbacks of using phage in diagnostic assays is the aspecific adsorption of proteins leading to a high background signal and decreasing sensitivity. To deal with this, we developed a genetically pure, exchangeable dual-display phage system in which biomarkers and streptavidin-binding protein (SBP) are displayed at opposite ends of the phage. This approach allows for sample purification, using streptavidin-coated magnetic beads resulting in a higher sensitivity of signal detection assays. Our dual-display cassette system approach also allows for easy exchange of both the anchor protein (SBP) and the displayed biomarker. The presented principle is applied for the detection of antibody reactivity against UH-RA.21 which is a good candidate biomarker for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The applicability of dual-display phage preparation using a helper plasmid system is demonstrated, and its increased sensitivity in phage ELISA assays using patient serum samples is shown.",

            "text": "Necitumumab was also isolated from de Haard and collaborators' library by using A431 carcinoma cells, which express high levels of EGFR. Competition with cetuximab for binding to the cell surface generated one clone, termed 11F8, which displayed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on EGF-stimulated EGFR activation in A431 cells. A comparison of the structures of Fab11F8 with the Fab derived from cetuximab (FabC225) both in complex with EGFR, indicated that the epitope of the two Fabs was remarkably similar, but the antibodies having different CDRs, bound EGFR through a set of different interactions (39). Necitumumab, the new fully human antibody was thus developed, had similar biological properties to cetuximab, but without the disadvantages of a chimeric antibody. \n\nUntil relatively recently, phage display technology was controlled by a few companies, holding their technology patents (102). These patents expired in Europe and the United States, thus, allowing the free use of the antibody discovery methodology via phage display by academic laboratories and small biotech organizations. As phage display technology has become a commodity, several companies such as BioRad using HuCAL \u00ae (103), Distributed Bio via SuperHuman synthetic libraries, 2 and GlobalBio/ADL by means of semi-synthetic ALTHEA Gold Libraries\u2122 3 are licensing phage display libraries and/or offering discovery services at a relatively low cost without royalty payments. \n\nIn addition to phage, other display platforms have been developed, including ribosome (104), bacteria (105), yeast (106), and mammalian (107) display. Each of these platforms has advantages and disadvantages. One of the advantages of yeast display, which is the most commonly used, over phage display is the screening using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. This advantage has proven to be an efficient means to isolate antibodies with very high affinity, e.g., in the low femtomolar range (108). In addition, while phage is limited to the display of antibody fragments such as scFvs or Fabs, yeast enables the display of full IgG antibodies with glycosylation.",

            "text": "Phage ImmunoPrecipitation Sequencing (PhIP-Seq) is a programmable phage display technology that enables unbiased analysis of antibody binding specificities [1\u00c03]. An oligonucleotide library encoding the complete human proteome as~250,000 overlapping 90 amino acid peptides was cloned into the mid-copy T7 phage display vector (~5\u00c015 copies of displayed peptide per phage particle) and is immunoprecipitated by serum antibodies for analysis by high throughput DNA sequencing. This enables serum antibody profiling against hundreds of thousands of peptide epitopes at low cost [2,4]. Since the phage library is produced in E. coli, the displayed peptides lack post-translational modifications (PTMs) relevant to human disease [5,6]. Here, we enzymatically modify the phage-displayed human peptidome, such that PTM-dependent autoantibody reactivities can be precisely assessed by quantitative comparison to the unmodified library.\n\nCitrullination is the post-translational conversion of arginine in proteins to citrulline, which in humans is catalyzed by the calciumdependent peptidylarginine deiminase (PAD) family of enzymes [7,8]. This modification can impart antigenicity to self-proteins, and in the case of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), results in the production of anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs) [9]. These antibodies are believed to participate in disease pathogenesis by binding citrullinated proteins in the synovial joint [10,11]. The discovery of autoantibodies to peptidylcitrulline epitopes in RA serum led to the development of a diagnostic Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) using synthetic cyclic citrullinated peptides (CCP) [12]. Since this anti-CCP antibody test can achieve diagnostic sensitivity of~80% and a specificity up to 98%, anti-CCP antibodies have become a routinely utilized biomarker for RA [13,14].\n\nOf the five known PAD isoforms, PAD2 and PAD4 make up the majority",

            "text": "Diagnostic assays hampered by the lack of specificity caused by polyclonal capture and detection antibodies highlighted the need for more specific tests. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific reagents and are being used for a variety of research and diagnostic purposes within the FMD field and their pivotal role in all aspects of FMD research is now clear. However, traditional monoclonal antibodies, produced using hybridoma technology, and used in diagnostics have several limitations such as its high cost, time-consuming production, and the expertise required (32)(33)(34). \n\nThe development of large combinatorial antibody libraries based on antibody genes expressed and displayed on phages have revolutionized the selection and isolation of unique antibodies to an antigen and aided in the development of recombinant reagents for ELISA (35). A key advantage of phage display of antibody fragments is that the generation of specific singlechain variable fragment (scFv) or antigen binding fragment (Fab) to a particular antigen can be completed within a few weeks compared to hybridomas taking months. Antibody libraries can be either immune (from immunized donors) or na\u00efve (from non-immunized donors). An immune library will have an antibody range that is highly enriched for antibodies generated in response to a particular immunogen, whereas, the na\u00efve library can advantageously be used for an unlimited array of immunogens (36). \n\nPhage display libraries have been used with success to map epitopes for FMDV for serotype O (37,38) and the SAT2 serotype (25). The Nkuku R phage-display library, which is a large semisynthetic library of recombinant filamentous bacteriophages displaying scFv's derived from combinatorial pairings of chicken variable heavy and light chains, was used for this study (36). This na\u00efve library has been utilized to generate a variety of antibodies against antigens such as the bluetongue virus, African horse sickness virus, echovirus 1, coxsackievirus B3, FMDV of the SAT2 serotype as well as a mycobacterial 16 kDa antigen (25,36,(39)(40)(41)(42).",

            "text": "The phage display technique due to simplicity, high efficiency, in vitro nature, rapidity and low-cost is a powerful tool for selecting target-specific ligands. Efficient selection by biopanning leads to the isolation of ligands with unique, specific and desirable functional characteristics. Its robustness has been amply justified with its use in synthetic biology, immunotherapeutics, diagnostics, development of bioassays and biosensors, epitope mapping, mimotopes and drug discovery. As evidenced in past, phage antibody display has been a subject of many patents in therapeutics and diagnostics. It has remained an important choice for monoclonal antibody selection, diagnosis and treatment of viral infections. Phage antibody display offers a variety of platforms for exploiting antigen binding; however, diversity and stability of displayed library are a concern. Further advancements, such as addition of non-canonical aminoacids, leading to expansion of ligands which can be identified using a library, will help in broadening the possible applications and potentials of phage display technology. The new landmarks may require a close association with nanosciences and chemical engineering to design well-curated semi-synthetic libraries for incorporating more structurally diverse displayed epitopes.\n\nThe widespread use of phage display technology to assist in exploration of novel targets through epitope mapping has helped in understanding interactions of coronaviruses with human cell receptors and other molecules. The pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 has recently taken many lives, and although symptomatic treatment is being made available to infected persons, yet there have been no specific options for prevention of nCoV infection. Phage display has offered a deeper insight into protein interactions involved in pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. Now it is known that partially neutralizing antibodies derived from scFv library can be obtained outside RBD of spike protein as well. Among the exciting contributions are the pre-clinical trials of two phage display library-derived antibody candidates against S protein of SARS-CoV-2. In order to develop a greater understanding of the infectious biology, pathogenesis and blocking mechanisms of currently circulating, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV-2, phage display may certainly play an effective role by offering a repertoire of blocking peptides and neutralizing antibodies.\n\nPh",

            "text": "Phage display is a powerful in vitro selection technique, which enables the identification of high-affinity peptides or antibodies from libraries of phage particles displaying highly diverse peptides [1]. Libraries with a great variety of peptides are subject to one or more rounds of affinity selection, also called biopanning, which contains repetitive rounds of target-binding (selection) and proliferation [2]. The rapid isolation of ligands for a distinct target by biopanning has a wide range of applications extending from epitope determination [2,3], protein-protein interaction detection [4], to new vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics development [5][6][7]. \n\nAdditionally, the selection from phage-displayed libraries has been increasingly employed in the design of new chemicals [8] and the development of new materials [9]. \n\nIn recent years, next-generation sequencing (NGS) has substantially contributed to the analysis of phage-displayed screens [10][11][12][13][14][15]. In sharp contrast with traditional phage display, phage display selections powered by NGS can produce enormous data output and facilitate the finding of specific binders by avoiding iterative selections and restraining the number of false positive hits [11]. However, both classical phage display and next-generation phage display (NGPD) screens are deeply troubled by the emergence of target-unrelated peptides (TUPs). Derda et al. described and confirmed that selection from phage display libraries is driven by two independent pressures [10,16]: (1) the selection-related pressure which enriches for clones that bind to the desired target or non-target-related components (e.g., protein A/G, bead) of the biopanning system during the selection step [17]; (2) The proliferation-related pressure which enriches clones exhibiting faster proliferation abilities during the amplification step [18][19][20]. Hence, biopanning output is actually a mixture of true binders and TUPs.",

            "text": "Phage display has proven to be an unequivocal success for antibody discovery, evidenced by 17 approved mAbs and an increasing number of phage-derived antibodies under clinical investigation. As an entirely in vitro technology, phage display not only compensates for many limitations inherited by in vivo antibody discovery approaches, it also provides a highly versatile and customizable platform that continuously evolves to meet distinct development goals.\n\nAffinity is a key factor used to evaluate the quality of a phage library. It has been observed that affinity that can be achieved is correlated with the library size. We investigated the correlation between highest affinity values obtained from published universal phage libraries and library size (data not shown). In agreement with previous observations, there is a positive correlation between the two parameters. This is because a universal library is designed for antibody discovery against any given target. Therefore, a larger library (higher diversity) offers a greater chance of identifying high affinity antibodies. In the case of a synthetic library, although a limited number of frameworks are used, the designed CDR diversity usually far exceeds the natural CDR diversity. Therefore, the chance to obtain high affinity antibodies mainly depends on CDR sequence diversity. In the case of a na\u00efve library, the library diversity comes from not only the sequence diversity, but also from light and heavy chain rearrangement. Of note, the random heavy and light chain rearrangement is a process highly resembling chain shuffling, which is a routine strategy for in vitro antibody affinity maturation. This may explain why antibodies with very high affinity were isolated from na\u00efve phage libraries, even when the libraries were constructed from germline sequences with no or very limited somatic hypermutations. While it was expected that identification of library size is a key factor that determines the affinity, a correlation with either library type or library generation was not observed (data not shown). One reason is that, except for a few early libraries, the library size difference among three generations of phage libraries is minimal. Also, the advancements of three generations of phage libraries mainly reflects improvements of overall developability properties.\n\nIt has been reported that the presence of library clones that do not display antibody fragments (bald phage) is partially due to stop codons or frameshifts present in the antibody gene. These clones often outgrow because of the decreased burden on production of",

Since originally developed [1], phage display has become a work horse around the world both for basic protein chemistry work as well as for academic and pharmaceutical development of biotherapeutic drugs, e.g. the therapeutic antibodies used in autoimmune disease and cancer. \n\nIn the current study by Rom an-Mel endez et al [2], the scope has been to use phage display technology to help define the breadth of anti-citrullinated peptide autoantibodies (ACPA) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Within the field of clinical immunology, a positive serological antibody test is often part of the clinical diagnostic criteria, and in many disease settings the precise target(s) of autoantibodies are well understood. However, in RA synthetic peptide(s) (CCP2/3) are used in the clinical assays serving as a proxy for ACPA reactivity. The autoantigens contain the modified amino acid citrulline, which is naturally generated by enzymatic modification by PADs, but the precise autoantibody targets are still debated in RA. \n\nPhage display has proven an effective method for epitope mapping of monoclonal antibodies as well as for understanding natural immune responses. The phage systems enable screening of a large number of candidate epitopes with more affinity discrimination than peptide arrays, but comes with the caveats of primarily binding to linear epitopes and not including mammalian specific post-translational modifications (PTMs). While randomized peptide libraries have been successfully used in many studies including recently for mapping SARS-CoV2 antibodies [3], cDNA or synthetic peptidome libraries have the advantage of only containing naturally occurring epitopes making them more applicable for directed human serological studies. Many original phage display platforms have used the M13 bacteriophage, yet the T7 phage-based systems have recently shown to be highly competitive, in particular for fast high-throughput proteomic screenings. This has previously also been demonstrated using the VirScan platform for screening of antibody responses to common viruses [4].",

            "text": "[18][19][20].\n\nThere are various applications of a phage display. In the current work, we used a phage display for the discovery of TB biomarkers. The same system can be applied to identify novel markers for multi-drug resistance in TB, which is becoming a major issue in TB treatment. Additionally, phage displays can be used for the development of specific targeted therapies [42]. The phage display technology and immunoscreening has utilities not only in identifying diagnostic biomarkers, but also may enable us to develop a novel targeted therapy utilizing the peptide sequences (mimotopes) as vehicles to deliver specific drugs. The identified sequences can be used to develop peptide/protein-coated magnetic nanoparticles for clinical testing or for applications in drug delivery [43]. Additionally, this technology might enable us to discover unknown epitopes targeting specific bacterial antigens leading to immunogenicity and antibody production in TB subjects, as well as providing us with a better understanding of host immune defenses in TB subjects. For instance, TB sera were less reactive to some of the identified clones (TetR, menD, CobN, and OplA), these clones are less likely to be used for diagnostic purposes. However, these clones can be used to develop new vaccine and to boost the immunity against TB infection. Furthermore, this microarray platform can be hybridized to detect IgA in sputum of TB patients that may have clinical values. Moreover, antibody detection in the sera of patients has a potential value in clinical practice, as it is non-invasive and requires a minimal amount of blood or other bodily fluids.\n\nThe lack of sensitivity and specificity and cross-reactivity of biomarkers with other diseases dampened the enthusiasm in TB biomarker discovery studies. However, our study shows excellent sensitivity and specificity, not only as compared to healthy controls but also to another granulomatous disease. Other studies using gene expression profiling between TB and sarcoidosis found 94% similarities [44,45]. Our system has the advantage of detecting TB clones with high sensitivity and specificity and is based on an immune reaction rather than gene expression. The detection of this immune reaction, in form of antibodies, relies on a complex interaction between antigen presenting cells, T cells and B cells",

Through genetic engineering and chemical modification, M13 phages can be functionalized into a multifunctional analysis platform with various functional regions conducting their functionality without mutual disturbance. Its unique filamentous morphology and flexibility also promoted the analytical performance in terms of target affinity and signal amplification. In this review, we mainly focused on the application of M13 phage in the analytical field and the benefit it brings. We also introduced several genetic engineering and chemical modification approaches for endowing M13 with various functionalities, and summarized some representative applications using M13 phages to construct isolation sorbents, biosensors, cell imaging probes, and immunoassays. Finally, current issues and challenges remaining in this field were discussed and future perspectives were also proposed.",

            "text": "Phage display technology, invented by George P. Smith in 1985 to display peptides (59), was later adapted in 1990 to display the antibody fragments on phage (60). Since then, the technology has successfully facilitated the discovery of hundreds of antibodies for research, diagnostic, and therapeutic applications, including more than 17 clinically approved antibodies (38,61). Compared with other display technologies, such as yeast and mammalian display, one of the advantages of phage display is the ability to create large libraries with diversities of up to 10 11 unique clones. Robust in vitro phage selection procedures have been developed, allowing selection on a variety of antigen sources [e.g. protein, peptide, cells, virus-like particles (VLPs), nanodiscs, liposomesreviewed elsewhere (39)] to identify molecules with specificity to desired epitopes, including the use of sophisticated FACS-based selections on phage to identify rare antibodies against challenging targets (62). Phage display typically uses filamentous bacteriophage M13 of E. coli and can be exploited to express various antibody formats. Antibody fragments are usually fused to the minor coat protein encoded by gene 3 (pIII), present at 3-5 copies per phage. In the early phage systems, the pIII fusion was created in the phage genome (60). To enable the construction of large libraries, a phagemid system is more commonly used, where the Ab-pIII fusion is encoded on a plasmid bearing a phage single-stranded origin of replication (63)(64)(65). The assembly of phage particles is then facilitated by co-infection of E. coli with helper phage to provide all crucial components for M13 phage packaging. Due to the competition between pIII from the helper phage and the phagemid encoded Ab-pIII fusion, display levels are typically low (e.g., 10% of phage displaying a single copy). To overcome this, a helper phage lacking gene 3 (\"Hyperphage\") has been created to increase display levels and enable avidity-based selections (66, 67) [reviewed elsewhere (39,68)].",

Neither are other in vitro alternatives such as cell surface display (mammalian, yeast or bacterial) or ribosome display feasible due to their lower resistance to high temperatures or extreme pH. Phage can tolerate temperatures of up to 60\u00b0C and a pH range of 2-11 (98). Table 1 provides a summary comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of these various in vitro techniques. \n\nPhage display is also likely to remain useful for discovery of antibodies against non-protein targets, evolution of dual-binding antibodies and for affinity maturation, due to the limitations of the natural immune system. However, antibodies against non-protein targets such as lipids and carbohydrates remain a fairly unexplored area, partially due to the lack of validated therapeutic targets aside from bacterial membrane surface carbohydrates. One area that could be of particular interest is lipids involved in autoimmune and neurodegenerative disorders, for which there is some evidence that antibodies could have both protective and pathological roles and which a therapeutic antibody designed to suppress immune function, e.g. of the IgG4 isotype, could have benefits. \n\nFor regular protein antigens, there may still be one particular niche for phage display based on its strengths: the rapid development of therapeutic antibodies against emerging diseases or a genetically modified pathogen in an emergency situation. Antibodies are a natural and well-studied component of the immune system and use of a naturally derived antibody should have minimal side effects and thus be ideal for emergency use. In such a situation, rapid antibody isolation is critical. Phage display allows for the screening of an extremely large collection of antibodies of up to 10 11 sequences, far more than that possible by Next Generation sequencing or single B-cell analysis, thus improving the chance of isolating rare antibodies.",

In view of these current limitations the generation of specific high affinity recombinant antibodies may significantly improve the current situation and can make the rapid immunological detection widely available.\n\nA promising method to generate recombinant antibodies against human pathogenic viruses like VEEV is the antibody phage display technology. Using antibody phage display, genotype and phenotype of an antibody fragment are linked by fusing the antibody gene fragment to the minor coat protein III gene of the filamentous bacteriophage M13. The resulting antibody fragment::pIII fusion protein is displayed on the surface of the phage particles [18][19][20][21]. The most common antibody formats used for this technology are the Fragment antigen binding (Fab) and the single chain Fragment variable (scFv). In comparison to the Fab, that is consisting of the Fragment deter-mining (Fd) of the heavy chain and the light chain linked by a disulphide bond, the scFv simply consists of the variable region of the heavy chain (V H ) and the variable region of the light chain (V L ), connected by a short peptide linker [22,23]. The selection of antibody fragments from antibody gene libraries is performed by an in vitro selection process [24,25], that is also referred to as \"panning\".\n\nIn this study, we demonstrated the selection of human antibody fragments from a na\u00efve antibody gene library specific for the detection of VEEV. We describe their immunological properties and discuss their possible application of these antibodies for diagnosis and detection of VEEV after a potential bioterrorism assault or natural outbreak of VEEV.",

            "text": "Chessboard antibody combination testing resulted in the identification of 7 antibody pairs that detect as little as 22.7 nM Ag85 in patient sera or 6.1 nM in serum freeconditions. The uniqueness of this work relies in the fact that each validated antibody was specific for the Ag85-complex only. Other approaches were aimed at discovering subunit-specific antibodies, as in the case of Fuchs et al. Here, the na\u00efve HAL7/8 phage display libraries were incubated with recombinant Ag85B subunit (Fuchs et al., 2014). The resulting antibodies were shown to have, in sandwich ELISA or lateral flow test, an antigen protein limit of detection of respectively 10 ng/mL and <5 ng/ mL. Nevertheless, when using bacterial cell extracts or filtered culture material, immunodetection could be only performed in ELISA or western blot. The authors concluded that the absence of an antibody affinity improvement step may have been the reason for their results. This supposition found indirect confirmation in a different study by Sixholo and colleagues (Sixholo et al., 2011) describing the selection of antibodies against the Mtb 16 kDa heat shock protein X (HspX) from chicken semi-synthetic Nkuku antibody gene library. By the repetition of four panning rounds against recombinant antigen material, three unique scFv's were confirmed to bind HspX in ELISA. On purpose, the clone with the weakest binding was chosen for in vitro affinity maturation by different methods. In the first approach, a mutant library of the parental antibody gene was generated by error-prone PCR, resulting in a diversity of ~3 \u00d7 10 7 unique scFv clones. Repeating the antibody selection using this library under more stringent conditions, led to the discovery of three mutant scFv's with increased binding affinity. Direct binding comparison in ELISA showed that the newly generated antibodies produced a signal ~11 times higher than the parental clone. The result was confirmed by the improved association and dissociation kinetics in SPR analysis. All affinity-improved antibody genes contained mutated amino acids in both CDR and framework regions.",

            "text": "Phage display was first described in 1985 by George Smith and Gregory Winter, who were awarded the 2018 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this discovery. They reported that foreign peptides could be successfully expressed on the surface of bacteriophage particles by integrating a gene of interest into a phage genome upstream of its coat protein open reading frame (Smith, 1985). It is noteworthy that a conceptually similar study was independently conducted by a Russian scientific group led by A.A. Ilyichev, who incorporated a peptide-coding sequence into the pVIII protein gene of M13 phage (Ilyichev et al., 1992;Minenkova et al., 1993). Later, G. Smith and colleagues proposed a selection strategy for the enrichment of population of recombinant phage clones that specifically bind to the target ligand, using affinity enrichment process (Smith, 1985). Since there is a direct physical link between the genotype of the recombinant phage particle and the phenotype of the fusion protein, this method allows the identification of DNA sequences encoding selected molecules. \n\nSubsequently, G. Smith and colleagues described the crea tion of combinatorial phage libraries that contain a large number of phage particles, each carrying a unique protein or peptide on its surface. Currently, one the most common types of phage libraries used for studying various proteinto-protein, receptor-ligand interactions or protein engineering are antibody phage libraries displaying single-stranded (scFv) and antigen-binding (Fab) fragments of IgG molecules (McCafferty et al., 1990;Winter et al., 1994). There are also alternative antibody formats used for the construction of antibody phage libraries, such as variable domains of antibodies from the heavy chains of camelids (VHH, or nanobodies) and sharks (vNAR) (Davies, Riechmann, 1995;Greenberg et al., 1995). \n\nIn order to create phage antibody library, antibody fragments to be exposed are usually fused to the N-terminus of the pIII phage coat protein.",

            "text": "The analysis of the literature data shows the good prospects of using phage-display methods for the design of analytical tools for the early detection of cancer, specifically prostate cancer. Traditionally, phage-display methods have been used for the discovery and improvement of antibodies, and their antigen-binding fragments are widely used in numerous immunochemical detection devices. Considering the huge public interest in this area of research and development [76], one can expect the further development of antibody phage display technology to improve the performance of modern detection methods. Furthermore, the tremendous success in the development of novel analytical methods for the fast, inexpensive detection of SARS viruses using novel analytical platforms and sensing materials during the COVID pandemic promoted the development of new approaches for the construction of novel biosensor platforms for the mass screening of humans for early signs of cancer. In this contest, the landscape phages described here appear competitive in comparison with novel interfaces and diagnostic probes [16]. For example, the model-phage-based electrochemical and ELISA immunosensors showed comparable limits of detection to most advanced antibody-, aptamer-, and Au-based biosensors. In contrast to other interfaces, the phage structure is extraordinarily robust, being resistant to heat, organic solvents, urea, acid, and alkali, and can tolerate different modifications that increase the efficacy of their use as detection and diagnostic probes [124]. For example, the conjugation of a phage with gold nanoparticles is a straightforward, reliable process [62], which can be easily adapted for the construction of different types of lateral flow immunoassays for point-of-care prostate-specific antigen testing [16]. Purified phages can be stored indefinitely at moderate temperatures without losing their infectivity and binding activity [46,125,126]. An important advantageous characteristic of landscape phages is their availability for safe, large-scale production, and their use in prostate cancer control, as recently reviewed [16,[127][128][129]. \n\nFunding: The effort of the Author in writing the Review was supported by Auburn University.",

            "text": "mammalian cell-surface display, mRNA display, and DNA display have been used for antibody discovery [132]. Among these, phage display is the most widely used for antibody selection [133]. Its use has resulted in the discovery of over 80 mAbs that have entered clinical trials [134]. In 2002, adalimumab became the first phage display-derived mAb to have been granted market approval, and was also the first approved human mAb [131]. Small recombinant antibody fragments (e.g., scFv) [135,136] or fragment antigen-binding (Fab) [137,138] are also commonly selected by phage display, in addition to full antibodies [139]. A selection of FDA-approved phage display-derived antibody therapeutics are summarized in Table 2. Four exceptions in this table are the non-antibody peptides ecallantide (Kalbitor \u00ae ), Romiplostim (Nplate \u00ae ), albigutide (Tanzeum \u00ae ), and Xyntha purification peptide. Antibody libraries are huge collections (>10 10 ) of antibody genes encoding antibodies with unknown properties. These are an essential resource for antibody discovery by phage display and other in vitro selection technologies [133]. Depending on their source of origin, antibody libraries are classified as immune libraries and universal libraries. Immune libraries containing affinity-matured antibodies [133] are constructed using donors (humans or animals) who have received immunization, have been infected or a chronically-diseased, or those suffering from cancer [140]. Affinity maturation is achieved by mutation and clonal selection in which mutated antibodies with higher antigen-binding affinity are enriched [141]. However, extensive or hypermutation may increase the risk of immunogenicity [133]. Of course, it is not possible to construct immune libraries for each disease due to ethical issues, high cost, and laborious procedures. One solution to this problem is to use universal libraries that are generated by a source for which the immune system had not been activated to recognize a specific antigen (na\u00efve) [132]. Moreover, due to the lack of affinity maturation, these universal libraries have low risk of immunogenicity [133]. In principle, a universal library can be applicable to mAb selection",

Phage libraries can be constructed to express combinatorial peptides or proteins/immunoglobulin fragments/variants that may be further screened for many different purposes including drug discovery, epitope mapping, diagnosis as well as identification of therapeutic antibodies. The phage display technology is versatile as it can be applied to different domains of research; it allows the easy handling and high-throughput screening of billions of sequences. It is affordable and enables the identification of linear as well as conformational epitopes when applied to an antibody target.\n\nNumerous studies have described the use of the phage display technology in the field of HIV-1 were reported. They can be classified in four main applications ( Figure 2): I. Epitope mapping, which relies on the screening of random peptide libraries on immobilized monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies to determine the linear and/or conformational epitopes recognized by these antibodies (linear epitope: sequence of continuous amino acids recognized by the paratope of a given antibody; conformational/discontinuous epitope: group of amino acids scattered along a protein sequence which come together in the folded protein and are recognized by the paratope of a given antibody). Such screening usually results in the identification of sequences mimicking the natural epitope (mimotopes) and provides precise information about the location of residues forming the natural epitope. These mimotopes may in turn be used as valuable immunogens to elicit antibodies targeting the original epitope, an approach referred to as -reverse vaccinology\u2016. II. Inhibitor discovery, based on screening of phage libraries displaying random peptides or antibody fragments against viral or host proteins critical for viral replication.\n\nIII. -Phage Substrate\u2016 approach in which potential substrate sequences are displayed at the phage surface to enzymes such as proteases. This approach not only allows for proteolysis specificity profiling, but provides information and data to develop specific inhibitors. IV.

            "text": "BackgroundNanobodies (Nbs) have proved their great value as therapeutic molecules and clinical diagnostic tools. Although the routine procedure to obtain Nbs is to immunize camels with antigens, it is unavailable to immunize a camel when the antigens are highly toxic, pathogenic or nonimmunogenic. A synthetic phage display library is an alternative to generate Nbs against such targets, besides all the other ones.MethodsWe constructed a large and diverse synthetic phage display Nanobody (Nb) library based on the conserved camel single-domain antibody fragment (VHH) framework of cAbBCII10. Diversity was introduced in the complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) by means of randomization of synthetic oligonucleotides. Then human prealbumin (PA) and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) were used to select specific Nbs from this library. Furthermore, a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed to detect PA based on horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-PA Nb isolated from this study and another biotinylated anti-PA Nb obtained from an immune library, in our previous study.ResultsA large and diverse synthetic phage display Nb library with CDR3 regions randomized by trinucleotide cassettes was constructed. The library size was 1.65\u2009\u00d7\u2009109\u00a0CFU/mL and the correct insertion ratio was nearly 100%. A Nb against human PA and against NGAL was successfully isolated from the synthetic library. The obtained anti-PA Nb was effectively used to develop a sandwich ELISA for PA detection and it demonstrated a working range from 50 to 1000\u00a0ng/mL, with a limit of detection (LOD) of 27.1\u00a0ng/mL.ConclusionThis proposed novel synthetic library was a good source for obtaining some antigen-specific Nbs. This approach could provide crucial support to an immune library and a na\u00efve library in the acquisition of specific Nbs, potentially functioning as a great resource for medical diagnostic applications. In addition, we have successfully developed a novel sandwich ELISA to detect PA, which could provide great assistance for clinical PA detection.",

            "text": "Phage display has initially been developed and used to map antibody epitopes (Smith, 1985(Smith, , 2019, identify antigens involved in diseases such as cancer (Mintz et al., 2015), autoimmune illnesses (Zhang and Reichlin, 2005), and parasitic infections (Ellis et al., 2012), including Chagas disease (Alvarez et al., 2001;Pitcovsky et al., 2001;Kamath et al., 2020). It has also been used for many other translational applications (Giordano et al., 2001;Arap et al., 2002;Michaloski et al., 2016;Tang et al., 2019), attesting to the great versatility of this combinatorial methodology. In its essence, phage display involves inserting a fragment of DNA inframe with a bacteriophage surface coat protein gene, such that the corresponding peptide (or antibody) encoded by the exogenous DNA fragment is displayed on the bacteriophage surface ( Figure 1A). If the peptide is a fragment of an antigen recognized by a given antibody, the bacteriophage particle can be captured and isolated from the pool of phage particles. The challenge with standard phage display is that random peptide libraries (produced with synthetic degenerate oligonucleotides) often lead to mimotopes, peptides that mimic but do not necessarily share sequence identity or similarity with the corresponding antigen. Despite these limitations, it has been instrumental in identifying relevant antigens and epitopes for several diseases, including Chagas disease (Pitcovsky et al., 2001;Mintz et al., 2015;Kamath et al., 2020). We have reasoned that this outcome could perhaps be circumvented with libraries produced from genetic material (cDNA or genomic DNA) isolated from an organism. These natural phage display libraries yield peptides encoded by the genome of the selected organism. Thus, when using genomic DNA, the result might perhaps be an unbiased phage library that displays peptides derived from all possible reading frames of a given organism genome. To date however, genome shotgun phage display libraries have been limited to viruses and prokaryotic organisms, given their comparatively smaller and far less complex,",

            "text": "The advent of human antibodies has been made possible through advances in genetic engineering in combination with sophisticated molecular biological techniques. The two principal technologies for the isolation of human antibodies are in vitro display methods, such as phage, yeast and ribosome display, and \"humanized\" mice, i.e., transgenic mice modified to contain genomic regions containing the human humoral immune systems. \n\nDisplay technologies enable high-diversity libraries containing antibody variable region fragments to be screened against a target antigen. Phage display is perhaps the most common technique and involves the display of antibody fragments derived from immunoglobulin gene libraries on the surface of fd filamentous phage, followed by antigen-driven selection. 15,16 The linking of phenotype (displayed antibody) with genotype (the gene encoding the antibody is harboured in the phagemid within the phage particle) allows the isolation of specific antibodies and subsequent rescue of the gene encoding the antibody. This technique has allowed the isolation of antibodies to a wide range of targets and epitopes that may not have been possible using traditional in vivo immunisation. 17 Fragments isolated by display technologies can easily be reformatted into whole immunoglobulin backbones in a high-throughput and sequence independent matter. 18 Even though phage display technology was established more than 20 years ago and despite the widespread use in early stage antibody discovery, to date only two approved antibody products have been created via phage display. These antibodies are adalimumab (Humira \u00ae , Abbott), approved in 2002, which is used in treatment of autoimmune disorders, and belimumab (BENLYSTA \u00ae , Human Genome Sciences and GlaxoSmithKline), approved in 2011 as the first new treatment for systemic lupus erythematosus in 56 years. \n\nMore recently, exciting developments have been made in the area of yeast display technologies. This includes technology developed by Adimab that involves modification of published yeast display methods. 19,20 This methodology enables rapid screening of antigens against high-diversity libraries (exceeding 10 14 ) and from the Wellcome Trust and the technology is available under license to both academic and commercial operations.",

            "text": "Although it is a routine technique, phage display is still rarely used to develop antibodies for tissue section analysis. Currently, most of the available antibodies have been obtained using animal immunization, frequently with synthetic peptides. However, the development of suitable in vitro approaches for antibody discovery might quickly change this, as observed for therapeutic antibodies where display approaches have largely confirmed their value and interest [76]. \n\nThe results presented in this review indicate that IHC-compatible antibodies can be obtained using phage-displayed na\u00efve antibody libraries. This is true for fresh and frozen tissue samples, and also for FFPE tissue sections. Table 1 summarizes the results presented in this review and shows that IHC-f-and IHC-p-compatible antibodies have been obtained in 16 (73%) and 8 (36%) of the reviewed studies, respectively. However, this high success rate is frequently due to the screening of a large number of clones (Table 1, column \"Nb of clones\"). In particular for IHC-p, the fraction of positive clones varies widely in the cited publications between 0.13% in Ruan et al. [60] and 31% in Jarutat et al. [53], but with a low median value of 2.4%. The necessity to screen a large number of clones is probably due to the difficulty to set up high-throughput screening procedures by IHC but also to the complexity of tissues. The fraction of positive clones is even lower is we consider as positive only the clones able to stain specifically a collection of positive tissues from different patients and organs, since only few of the antibodies isolated in the reviewed publications were robust enough to set up real IHC applications (Table 1, column \"Note\"). Of note, the best success rate was obtained by Jarutat et al. [53], who used FFPE sections throughout the procedure, that is for panning, screening, and characterization, illustrating how phage display selections should be conducted to maximize the chance of success. \n\nThus, three main issues need to be solved before the wide and reliable implementation of phage display for IHC applications. First, IHC-compatible screening methods must be developed to test several hundred of clones (Table 1, column \"Nb of clones\" for the first screening).",

            "text": "Phage display technology (Figure 3) emerges as the primary method for preparing mimicking peptides, vital in toxin detection. These polypeptides mimic antigen epitopes and entail genetic modification of phage DNA. By binding to a phage coat protein, peptides, proteins, and antibody fragments are expressed on the phage surface. Additionally, the introduction of exogenous DNA sequences permits the display of related genes and their products on the phage surface (58,59). Moreover, the protein or peptide maintains its ability to recognize molecular targeted binding sites (60). In 1985, Smith pioneered the phage display technique, fusing the restriction endonuclease EcoR I with the PIII protein as a recombinant small coat protein (61). Subsequently, the shell proteins PVIII and PVI were also employed for phage display (62-64), with the innovative proposal of a dual display system (65). The M13 phages utilized in phage display can be classified into different carriers, including 3 + 3, 6 + 6, and 8 + 8 types. Phage vectors are primarily categorized into type 3/8 and type 33/88 vectors based on the number of displayed exogenous peptides (66). Phage display technology, renowned for its remarkable specificity and sensitivity, finds extensive application in nano immunosensor development for toxin detection. This versatile tool excels in epitope mapping and identifying mimotopes for diverse antigens. In essence, phage display technology stands as a potent approach for crafting highly specific and sensitive nano immunosensors, revolutionizing cholera toxin detection in water sources. \n\nPhage display technology has revolutionized protein engineering and drug discovery. Among the most common type are random peptide libraries, showcasing millions of epitopes that aid in identifying specific binding peptides for various targets, including microorganisms, organ tissues, and nanoparticles (67). Biopanning enables the selection of peptides with high affinity and selectivity towards their targets (68). The advancement of cyclic peptides has further bolstered the technology, yielding peptides with enhanced stability and bioactivity.",

            "text": "AD research is right on a critical juncture. Despite scientists have made significant progress in understanding the pathobiology of AD, no effective disease-modifying therapy has been identified so far. Phage display strategies have provided an unprecedented opportunity for the treatment of AD. The unique advantages of phage display address the challenges of low targeting and low specificity in drug discovery and biomarkers imaging, and provides strong support for the early diagnosis of AD asymptomatic period, targeted drug delivery and precision medicine. Although applications of phage display technology in cancer and tumors have been extensively reported in a large number of current literature [119,120], and some phage display derived peptides or antibodies for cancer treatment have been approved by the FDA [121,122], there have been relatively limited applications and development of the phage display-derived peptides in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.\n\nIn this review, we summarize various peptides screened from the phage display technology for the treatment, early detection and diagnosis, and brain targeted drug delivery of AD, with an aim to broaden the application of phage display technology in the neurodegenerative diseases. Further studies should focus on following issues to facilitate the transition from basic researches to clinical application: (i) In-depth phase display selection toward the AD pathological intermediates, particularly those with definite conformation. (ii) Optimization of biopanning process by introducing NGS. (iii) Self-assembly test of synthetic peptides to clarify the potential relationship between the assembled structure and bio-function. (iv) Discovery of new targets for AD therapy, such as tau phosphorylation and glycosylation. (v) Macrocyclic peptides or unnatural peptides composed by D-amino acids could be put in place to improve the serum stability of the peptides.\n\nSeveral FDA-approved cancer drugs (e.g., avelumab, moxetumomab pasudodox) have demonstrated the value of phage display as an established and reliable drug discovery platform and hold great promise for exploring the AD field. Ongoing in-depth investigation using the phage display technology will be essential to make key discoveries that will eventually reveal novel AD therapeutic approaches. The phage display technology strategy is now offering new tools and insights to advance our understanding",

            "text": "Bacteriophages, or phages, are prokaryotic viruses that specifically infect bacteria, and are the most abundant life form on earth. 1 Phages were first discovered in the early 20th century and noted for their antibacterial activity. The practice of administering phages (i.e., phage therapy) to patients suffering from bacterial infections began shortly after their discovery, but was controversial largely due to lack of mechanistic knowledge and variable success rates. In fact, the treatment was largely abandoned upon the discovery of antibiotics. 2 search in this field was reenergized, however, following the development of phage display systems in 1985. 3 George Smith, a chemist at the University of Missouri, demonstrated fusion of peptides to the outer (i.e., capsid) proteins of phages enabling surface display. This work, for which Smith shared a Nobel Prize in 2018, laid the ground work for affinity selection, epitope mapping, and antibody discovery. Since this time, phages have been an important tool for the bioengineering field, exploited for a range of applications including theranostics, 4 batteries, 5,6 drug delivery, 7 and vaccine development. 1 ages are one of many nanotechnologies being investigated for these applications. This review will focus on the advantages that phages provide to the nanomedicine field, specifically vaccination and immunotherapy. Nanomedicine ranges from diagnostics to treatments and relies on the fields of biomedical and chemical engineering, physics, and materials science to develop new technologies. Phage display technology has been explored in vaccines against infectious disease and immunotherapies for cancer due to their intrinsic immunogenicity and ability to display foreign antigens. These advantages, as well as important immunology background, will be discussed in detail in the following section.",

Similarly, Throsby et al., using combinatorial display libraries constructed from human memory B cells elicited by seasonal influenza vaccination, isolated 13 antibodies exhibiting broad heterosubtypic neutralizing activity against antigenically diverse H1, H2, H5, H6, H8 and H9 influenza subtypes (84). The most potent antibody was also protective in mice when given before and after lethal H5N1 or H1N1 challenge and the epitope was localized to the highly conserved Therapeutic antibodies from phage display 653 membrane-proximal stem of the HA1 and HA2 subunits of hemagglutinin (84,85). \n\nUsing a combination of panning strategies against the hemagglutinin from several antigenically distinct H5N1 isolates to bias-selection of antibodies towards more conserved domains of the protein, we were able to isolate similar antibodies to that described by Throsby et al. from a non-immune Fab phage display library (11). The selection of such antibodies from even non-immune phage displayed libraries highlights the potential of these readily available libraries for the development of therapeutically relevant antibodies against emerging pathogens of high concern and may enable more rapid development of therapies against novel emergent pathogens in the future.",

            "text": "The essential aspects of in vivo immunological selection have been emulated in vitro to yield display technologies that allow for identification of functional antibody variable regions in the absence of an animal host. 119,125 Thus, antibodies to almost any antigen, even those that are toxic or weakly immunogenic, can be discovered in a fraction of the time. The first step for display technologies is to select a library of heavy and light chain genes that can be cloned into the system of interest. The library is either derived from immunized, infected, or otherwise immune-challenged individuals; or from universal donors that have not undergone specific immune activation. While the former libraries are more focused and potentially affinity-matured, na\u00efve libraries have to potential to select antibodies against virtually any antigen. After cloning the library into the desired expression system, combinations of heavy and light chains, often in the scFv or Fab format, are displayed on the particle surface and selected by their ability to bind the antigen of interest. Non-binders are removed via wash steps to leave the best antibody candidates, which can be further refined through additional panning steps using the same or different binding conditions. Since the genes of interest are immediately available, the soluble protein can be expressed and used to quantify antibodyantigen affinity via methods such as ELISA. While hybridoma-derived antibodies still dominate the pool of therapeutics, six display-derived antibodies have been approved, and new in vitro methods for antibody selection continue to be discovered. 129 The first display technology developed, and still the most widely used, uses bacteriophage for surface expression of antibody variable domains and selection of antigen binders. 130 Phage display, which uses viruses such as M13 phage, works by fusing the antibody scFv sequence with that of phage surface molecules like coat protein pIII. 131 The DNA sequence within the plasmid codes for the corresponding surface protein, allowing for phenotypic selection and subsequent genotypic identification. Phage particles that bind antigen strongly are amplified via infection of bacterial hosts such as E. coli. This selective expansion of tightly binding phage particles allows for further rounds of panning or DNA sequencing of the associated scFvs. Several antibodies in clinical use were derived from phage display technology, with the first being adalimumab in 2002. 129 Mammalian-",

            "text": "Phage display has become an established, widely used method for selection of peptides, antibodies or alternative scaffolds. The use of phage display for the selection of antigens from genomic or cDNA libraries of pathogens which is an alternative to the classical way of identifying immunogenic proteins is not well-known. In recent years several new applications for oligopeptide phage display in disease related fields have been developed which has led to the identification of various new antigens. These novel identified immunogenic proteins provide new insights into host pathogen interactions and can be used for the development of new diagnostic tests and vaccines. In this review we focus on the M13 oligopeptide phage display system for pathogen research but will also give examples for lambda phage display and for applications in other disease related fields. In addition, a detailed technical work flow for the identification of immunogenic oligopeptides using the pHORF system is given. The described identification of immunogenic proteins of pathogens using oligopeptide phage display can be linked to antibody phage display resulting in a vaccine pipeline.",

            "text": "Phage display is a molecular biology technique that allows the presentation of foreign peptides on the surface of bacteriophages. It is widely utilized for applications such as the discovery of biomarkers, the development of therapeutic antibodies, and the investigation of protein\u2013protein interactions. When employing phages in diagnostic and therapeutic monitoring assays, it is essential to couple them with a detection system capable of revealing and quantifying the interaction between the peptide displayed on the phage capsid and the target of interest. This process is often technically challenging and costly. Here, we generated a fluorescent helper phage vector displaying sfGFP in-frame to the pIII of the capsid proteins. Further, we developed an exchangeable dual-display phage system by combining our newly developed fluorescent helper phage vector with a phagemid vector harboring the engineered pVIII with a peptide-probe. By doing so, the sfGFP and a peptide-probe are displayed on the same phage particle. Notably, our dual-display approach is highly flexible as it allows for easy exchange of the displayed peptide-probe on the pVIII to gain the desired selectivity, while maintaining the sfGFP gene, which allows easy visualization and quantification of the interaction peptide-probe. We anticipate that this system will reduce time and costs compared to the current phage-based detection systems.",

            "text": "Identifying antibodies with high affinity and target specificity is crucial for drug discovery and development; however, filtering out antibody candidates with nonspecific or polyspecific binding profiles is also important. In this issue of Cell Reports Methods, Saksena et al. report a computational counterselection method combining deep sequencing and machine learning for identifying nonspecific antibody candidates and demonstrate that it has advantages over more established molecular counterselection methods. \n\nTraditional antibody discovery processes make heavy use of screening platforms, such as phage, yeast, and mammalian display technologies (Parola et al., 2018). These methods link the phenotype and genotype of proteins displayed and allow for rapid selection of large libraries of proteins including antibodies and antibody fragments. For phage display, the platform used in Saksena et al. (2022), the most common type of antibody fragments displayed are single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) and antigen-binding fragments (Fabs). Till now, phage display libraries with diversities up to 10 11 sequences have been constructed and used extensively for antibody drug discovery. Traditional discovery by display platforms consist of performing several rounds of selection against target antigens, resulting in a pool of antigenspecific clones that then undergo additional experimental characterization and possibly follow-up engineering (e.g., affinity maturation) to select for therapeutic lead candidates. \n\nIn addition to high affinity to the target, a critical property for any antibody drug candidate is having minimal off-target binding. However, antibodies with offtarget binding may also become enriched and selected through a screening process such as phage display. These polyspecific or nonspecific antibodies have the capacity to bind unrelated antigens and are often linked to non-ideal pharmacokinetic profiles (Ho \u00a8tzel et al., 2012). There has been evidence that suggests nonspecific antibody sequences can be identified through shared features. For example, the VH6 germline family was identified as a source of nonspecific clones derived from a yeast-displayed naive human antibody library (Kelly et al., 2017). Additionally, certain physicochemical properties of amino acids in antibody variable regions have been found to be associated with nonspecific binding (Zhang et al., 2020).",

            "text": "BackgroundAntibody fragments selected from large combinatorial libraries have numerous applications in diagnosis and therapy. Most existing antibody repertoires are derived from human immunoglobulin genes. Genes from other species can, however, also be used. Because of the way in which gene conversion introduces diversity, the na\u00efve antibody repertoire of the chicken can easily be accessed using only two sets of primers.ResultsWith in vitro diagnostic applications in mind, we have constructed a large library of recombinant filamentous bacteriophages displaying single chain antibody fragments derived from combinatorial pairings of chicken variable heavy and light chains. Synthetically randomised complementarity determining regions are included in some of the heavy chains. Single chain antibody fragments that recognise haptens, proteins and virus particles were selected from this repertoire. Affinities of three different antibody fragments were determined using surface plasmon resonance. Two were in the low nanomolar and one in the subnanomolar range. To illustrate the practical value of antibodies from the library, phage displayed single chain fragments were incorporated into ELISAs aimed at detecting African horsesickness and bluetongue virus particles. Virus antibodies were detected in a competitive ELISA.ConclusionThe chicken-derived phage library described here is expected to be a versatile source of recombinant antibody fragments directed against a wide variety of antigens. It has the potential to provide monoclonal reagents with applications in research and diagnostics. For in vitro applications, na\u00efve phage libraries based on avian donors may prove to be useful adjuncts to the selectable antibody repertoires that already exist.",

            "text": "These complexes can be further biotinylated in a site-specific manner, a feature that is utilized for the in-vitro selection procedures of TCR-like antibody isolation and for the subsequent step of specificity characterization. Several laboratories attempted to generate antibodies recognizing T-cell epitopes [20,; however, many laboratories experienced difficulties and some authors have published their failure to isolate such antibodies [44,45]. A major breakthrough in generating these antibodies involved the development (in the mid-1990s) of alternative strategies to the conventional hybridoma approach. The pioneering work by Andersen and colleagues (1996) demonstrated the use of an antibody phage display approach as a tool for isolating antibodies with a unique specificity [20]. This format of phage display technology consists of generating antibody libraries exposed as fusion proteins on the surface of phage particles. Each phage particle displays a unique antibody (a Fab or single chain [sc] Fv fragment), which is encoded by genes present within the same phage particle. The purification of specific phages is accomplished by repeated rounds of selection on a specific target followed by amplification in bacterial cells of the eluted bound phages. Thus, in contrast to hybridoma technology, the phage display procedure involves positive selection for the requested binder. Several groups have developed methods for generating comprehensive phage display libraries of murine or human antibody Fab or scFv molecule fragments in E. coli cells (for a review see reference [51]). \n\nA phage display approach enabled the isolation of peptide-specific, MHC-restricted antibodies to murine class I complexes at first [20], and subsequently to human disease-related human HLA-peptide complexes using large na\u00efve human phage display libraries [27,[29][30][31][32]35,37,40,48,52,53].",

            "text": "As detailed above, bacteriophages are the natural viruses of bacteria that have been used to treat diseases for a long time. Therefore, in 1988, de la Cruz et al. modified the filamentous phage F1 from Escherichia coli in order to express repetitive regions from the circumsporozoite protein of Plasmodium falciparum [74]. The resulting phages displayed the recombinant protein on their capsid surface and were found to act as carriers capable of producing immunological responses in rabbits. This is one example of how one of the oldest and most abundant entities on Earth has been turned into a powerful therapeutic weapon. Since then, researchers have been investigating the potential of phages in the fight against other infectious diseases. Phage display libraries are a remarkably useful tool that allows the identification of the best ligands for a given target [75], permitting the construction of large libraries consisting of numerous antibody genes [76]. This type of libraries has been used since 1992 to identify specific monoclonal antibodies (mAb) against certain bacteria or viruses [77,78], and a high percentage of human therapeutic antibodies have been developed by this technique [79]. In the past, there have been several examples of phage display libraries expressing viral peptides that have successfully inhibited infections, for instance, the ones caused by adenovirus type 2 [80], hepatitis B virus [81], hantavirus, sin nombre virus [82], and Andes virus [83]. This justifies the use of these libraries as a diagnostic and treatment tools of SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 1).",

            "text": "Combinatorial antibody phage display technologies provide robust means for the rapid discovery of tumor antigen antibodies [13]. It is easy to implement and inexpensive. Numerous academic and industrial laboratories have adopted the technique and contributed to its advancement. The methods for design, construction and screening of synthetic antibody libraries are constantly being improved and semi-automated selection strategies have been proposed. The advantage of antibody phage display is the direct isolation of fully human antibodies in comparison to antibodies generated by mouse hybridoma technology where a laborious humanization procedure of the lead candidates is required. Many products of phage display are now reaching the Biopharmaceutical market. Monoclonal antibodies had been the standard as anticancer agents by modulating intrinsic tumor cell pathways and activating the innate immune response against cancer cells. Phage display derived human antibodies obviously can compete with earlier generation products as long as they are directed to well defined targets such as the EGFR or VEGF pathway. Phage display plays an important role in drug discovery and development with a number of molecules approved by FDA and many others in clinical trials. It is normal to expect that greater improvement will be made in the near future and phage display will bring many more contributions to oncology.",

            "text": "Phage libraries derived from rearranged V-gene repertoires are created using mRNA or RNA isolated from B cells obtained from either immunized or na\u00efve donors. The construction process entails initially preparing the cDNA template through reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Subsequently, the repertoire of variable heavy (VH) and variable light (VL) chain genes is amplified via PCR before being cloned into the phagemid vector [22]. While phage display technology has been widely used for novel antibody development, it is noteworthy that there are different types of phage display libraries after many years of development. \n\nAs one of the first libraries constructed, scFv libraries are commonly used for antibody selection. They consist of antibody fragments that include the VH and VL chains linked by a flexible peptide linker. This format allows the expression of functional antigen-binding sites in a single polypeptide chain. For instance, the Tomlinson I and J libraries are wellknown scFv libraries derived from human germline sequences. They offer a diverse source of antibody fragments for various applications. Another well-known application is the selection of scFv antibodies against specific tumor antigens using phage display, as demonstrated by Lee et al. [23]. In contrast, Fab libraries display antibody fragments that consist of the variable regions of both the heavy and light chains, along with the constant regions of the heavy chain. Fabs maintain the antigen-binding capacity of antibodies while providing additional structural stability. The HuCAL (Human Combinatorial Antibody Library) Fab library is a widely used human-derived library for the generation of Fab fragments with therapeutic potential [24]. In addition, a study by Gram et al. utilized a Fab phage display library to isolate antibodies specific to the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) [25]. \n\nIn addition to the libraries from human and mice, single-domain antibody (nanobody) libraries have been derived from the variable domains of the heavy-chain-only antibodies found in camelids, such as llamas and camels. Renowned for their unique structural and functional attributes, nanobodies are single polypeptide chains that retain the antigenbinding capabilities of conventional antibodies [26,27].",

            "text": "Up to date, a vast plethora of antibodies for diagnostic applications has been generated via phage-display against different bacterial proteins or carbohydrates (Table 1). Interestingly, research on this field seems to be in constant rise, as 44% of these antibodies have been generated only in the past five years. \n\nIn the following paragraphs, we offer detailed examples on antibodies against different bacterial pathogens that were generated using phage display. \n\nMycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is the bacteria responsible for a lung infection known as Tuberculosis (TB). This pathogen specifically attacks and replicates inside the macrophage cells in the alveoli, causing fatigue, fever and coughing (Fu and Fu-Liu, 2002). As of 2021, this disease affected approximately 10 million people and caused 1.5 million deaths worldwide per year (World Health Organization, 2021). TB early diagnosis is essential to improve treatment and limit disease spread. The protein secreted by Mtb in the highest amounts, Antigen 85 (Ag85), represents an ideal target for diagnostics (Wiker and Harboe, 1992). Ag85 is an oligomeric protein composed of three relatively small (30-32 kDa) homologue proteins (Ag85A, Ag85B and Ag85C) (Wiker et al., 1992). In a novel approach described by Ferrara et al. (2012), a combination of antibody display techniques was successfully adopted to select Ag85 complex-specific antibodies. A universal phage display na\u00efve scFv-library with a nominal diversity of ~10 11 unique antibodies was used for initial selection on Ag85, obtaining a sub-library of 10 5 pre-selected antibodies. Second, the selected antigen-specific scFv genes were used for the generation of yeast-display antibody sub-library. Upon completion of yeast based antibody generation, each clone was tested in FACS for its ability to specifically recognize the antigen target resulting in the discovery of 192 clones having the desired properties. Sequence analysis revealed that 111 of these antibodies were unique and could be used in further Ab characterization. Chessboard antibody combination testing resulted in the identification of 7 antibody pairs that detect as little as 22.7 nM Ag85 in patient sera or 6.1 nM in serum freeconditions.",

Based on this concept, NGS was adopted for the screening of antibody libraries to identify potential binders by monitoring the enrichment of a given sequence during the selection cycles [55]. Parallel comparative screenings of antibody libraries by traditional ELISA and NGS have demonstrated that, beyond top-ranking clones efficiently identified by both technologies, deep sequencing enables the discovery of many more specific binders among rare clones with potentially interesting features [38,56]. \n\nELISA and NGS have demonstrated that, beyond top-ranking clones efficiently identified by both technologies, deep sequencing enables the discovery of many more specific binders among rare clones with potentially interesting features [38,56].

We evaluated their biochemical properties with the aim of applying these Nanobodies as detecting reagents, and most importantly to demonstrate their applicability for SF surveillance. The nanobody (Nb, also known as VHH) as an alternative antibody format is the single domain antigenbinding fragment derived from the heavy chain-only antibody (HCAb) naturally occurring in camelids [25,26]. The straightforward selection via phage display of specific Nbs against virtually any target of interest has been established and retrieves effective affinity reagents for diagnosis and therapy [27,28]. More importantly, the unique paratopes of Nbs facilitate the targeting of their cognate antigens with high specificity and affinity and even allow the binding to the epitopes that are less accessible to conventional antibodies [29,30]. The excellent biochemical characteristics of Nbs, including the good solubility in aqueous solvents and high stability even under harsh conditions such as high temperature, extreme pH, and presence of chemical denaturants, qualified Nbs as promising candidates to develop diagnostic reagents for clinical applications [31,32]. \n\nIn this study, we developed Nbs with specificity against a clinical diagnostic indicator of SF and evaluated their potential as a tool for SF surveillance. In general, an immune Nb library was constructed after consecutive immunization with the antigen protein, which served as the Nb repertoire to retrieve SF-specific Nbs after several rounds of biopanning and screening. The characteristics, including specificity, affinity, and thermal stability of the retrieved Nbs have been measured to identify the lead Nbs. The targeting of the selected Nbs to SF has been verified by immunoprecipitation or blotting assay. The potential of selected SF-specific Nbs as diagnostic reagents has been confirmed by developing a heterologous Nb-pair-based sandwich ELISA with sufficiently high sensitivity and good reproducibility.",

            "text": "Phage display technique was first described by George Smith in 1985. In this technique, a foreign peptide or protein is expressed on the phage surface through transcriptional fusion with a coat protein gene (Smith 1985). Phage displayed library provides an opportunity for presenting of billions of pooled peptides on phage particles, then, these huge number of different peptides can be screened simultaneously for the desired affinity or activity (Bratkovic 2010). Nowadays, phage display technology are extensively used for various purposes in most fields of biological sciences such as epitope discovery (Cortese et al., 1994;Wang and Yu, 2004), epitope mapping and mimicking (Luzzago et al., 1993;Fack et al., 1997), identification of new receptor-ligands (Koivunen et al., 1999;Odermatt et al., 2001), making and isolation of antibodies (and their derivatives) with defined specificity and affinity (Winter et al., 1994). \n\nPhage display also demonstrates a unique application of bacteriophages in modern vaccine design, in which phage display libraries can be screened with a specific antiserum to isolate novel protective peptides (antigens / mimotopes) (Clark and March, 2006), or phages can be reconstructed to display a specific protective antigen on their surface (Bazan et al., 2012). With carrying antigens on their surface, phages have been used to direct vaccination. Rather than generating a transcriptional fusion to a coat protein, vaccine antigens can also be artificially conjugated to the surface of phage particles, which allow for a wide range of antigens to be displayed (Clark and March, 2006). Indeed, bacteriophages could provide the possibility of being manipulated-both genetically and chemically-that improves their capabilities. \n\nThe first use of whole phage particles to elicit an immune response against displayed foreign peptides was reported in 1988. In this study, repeat regions of the circumsporozoite (CS) protein gene of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum were cloned into the pIII gene-expressing a minor coat protein-of the filamentous bacteriophage f1.",

In this study, phages were selected based on their interaction with patient serum and exhaustively characterised by high-throughput sequencing. A bioinformatics approach was developed in order to identify peptide motifs of interest based on clustering and contrasting to control samples. Comparison of patient and control samples confirmed a major issue in phage display, namely the selection of unspecific peptides. The potential of the bioinformatic approach was demonstrated by identifying epitopes of a prominent peanut allergen, Ara h 1, in sera from patients with severe peanut allergy. The identified epitopes were confirmed by high-density peptide micro-arrays. The present study demonstrates that high-throughput sequencing can empower phage display by (i) enabling the analysis of complex biological samples, (ii) circumventing the traditional laborious picking and functional testing of individual phage clones and (iii) reducing the number of selection rounds.",

            "text": "Antibodies are the most preferred tools and are widely used for disease diagnostics and therapy. There is an increasing need for more stable and specific antibodies in the medical and diagnostic fields [37][38]. However, conventional hybridoma monoclonal antibody technology is laborious, expensive, time-consuming and has difficulty keeping up with the current pace of recognition of targeted antigen structures. The use of antibody phage display on a llama non-immune library provides a reliable, cost-effective and fast option for generating VHH antibodies. Non-immune libraries have many advantages in that the time-consuming immunization and library construction protocols can be omitted for each new target [39]. VHH antibodies are being researched for multiple pharmaceutical applications and have potential for use in the treatment of some diseases [40][41][42]. This is the first study that has successfully developed a reliable and controllable protocol for nanobody screening against DENV2-rNS1 protein from a nonimmune llama VHH library followed by the expression of the nanobodies by E. coli (BL21). \n\nAfter purification, sequence alignment of the VHH antibodies by the IMGT system revealed some sequence homology of the framework regions and residues within the two complementarity determining regions (CDR1, CDR2) with Lama glama (IGHV1S3*01, IGHJ4*01). However, the CDR3 regions, previously known to represent a highly antigenic recognition core, were different and did not show homology with the other sequences. Based on these findings, the high affinity of VHH antibodies might be due to these novel and longer CDR3 regions while other CDRs and some contact residues of the framework region may bind opportunistically with the antigen [31][32]. \n\nThe fast, user-friendly and cost-effective immunochromatographic assay, which is based on rapid diagnostic kits for NS1 detection in patient's serum, provides opportunities for point-ofcare diagnosis, especially in developing countries [13,43]. The selection of well characterized antibodies is crucial for the development of biosensors based on immunoassay. Currently, the frequency of dengue infection has increased because of warmer weather conditions and frequent international travel.",

            "text": "The human body hosts a large amount of microbes, including archaea, bacteria, fungi, viruses, and protozoa [1,2]. Among these, phages infect bacterial hosts and can trigger the lytic replication, release of new phage particles, and new bacterial infections [3]. In addition, phages can also \"collaborate\" with some bacterial to kill others. The famous \"kill-the-winner\" model demonstrated that higher-abundance bacterial species have a greater chance of encountering virulent phages and therefore suffer more dramatically than the low abundance bacterial species, which can cause a reset to balance in abundances between different bacterial species [4]. The interaction between phage and bacterial species depends on the binding between phage surface proteins and bacteria. To utilize such features for biotechnological or therapeutic purposes, Phage Display was introduced by Smith et al. in 1985 [5]. Phage display is a process in which libraries of proteins or peptides can be displayed as fusion proteins with one of the coat proteins on the phage surface [6]. Because phage display created a simple bridge between a DNA packaged with the phage and the binding targets of the phage, it provides a powerful method for identifying the strong binders over multiple rounds of selection. Phage display can be adopted in immune library screening, where a DNA library can be first introduced into phage vectors through cloning, and the subsequent screening procedure can help identify the phages that can express antibodies or a part of an antibody that can bind with a target protein molecule [7]. Most importantly, the DNA molecule encoding this antibody or antibody fragment within the phage can be characterized for further applications. Among the many applications of phage display with immune libraries, identifying antibodies that can specifically interact with cancer cells holds the most significant clinical potential.",

Recently, single domain antibodies (sdAbs; also called nanobodies; Nbs) have emerged as small (~15 kDa) antigen-binding fragments which are derived from camelid heavy-chain antibodies (15). They present several advantages including good solubility, thermal stability, and high expression yield (16)(17)(18). Furthermore, Nbs have a natural tendency for binding epitopes that are inaccessible to conventional antibodies (19). Nbs have been evaluated in vitro and in vivo and have been proven to be a valuable tool for optical molecular imaging of HER2-positive breast cancer (20). They are capable of selectively targeting HGF-producing tumors. Furthermore, treatment of U87 MG-bearing mice with these Nbs resulted in inhibition of tumor growth and ultimately caused cures (21). Consequently, these unique advantages make Nbs an attractive and valuable approach for the diagnosis and treatment of tumors. \n\nIn the present study, we successfully constructed an immune phage display library against CTLA-4 with the size of 1.85x10 8 colonies and generated characteristic anti-CTLA-4 Nbs. We further demonstrated their valuable properties of high binding rates and anti-melanoma activity.",

            "text": "BackgroundPhage display technology is a powerful new tool for making antibodies outside the immune system, thus avoiding the use of experimental animals. In the early days, it was postulated that this technique would eventually replace hybridoma technology and animal immunisations. However, since this technology emerged more than 20 years ago, there have only been a handful reports on the construction and application of phage display antibody libraries world-wide.ResultsHere we report the simplest and highly efficient method for the construction of a highly useful human single chain variable fragment (scFv) library. The least number of oligonucleotide primers, electroporations and ligation reactions were used to generate a library of 1.5 \u00d7 108 individual clones, without generation of sub-libraries. All possible combinations of heavy and light chains, among all immunoglobulin isotypes, were included by using a mixture of primers and overlapping extension PCR. The key difference from other similar libraries was the highest diversity of variable gene repertoires, which was derived from 140 non-immunized human donors. A wide variety of antigens were successfully used to affinity select specific binders. These included pure recombinant proteins, a hapten and complex antigens such as viral coat proteins, crude snake venom and cancer cell surface antigens. In particular, we were able to use standard bio-panning method to isolate antibody that can bind to soluble Aflatoxin B1, when using BSA-conjugated toxin as a target, as demonstrated by inhibition ELISA.ConclusionThese results suggested that by using an optimized protocol and very high repertoire diversity, a compact and efficient phage antibody library can be generated. This advanced method could be adopted by any molecular biology laboratory to generate both na\u00efve or immunized libraries for particular targets as well as for high-throughput applications.",

            "text": "However, these methods that claim high sensitivity also require greater technical skills as well as expensive instrumentation. In such a scenario, rapid identification methods using simple immunological assays for laboratory use, such as ELISA, and field portable biosensors could be more useful. \n\nIn general all antibody detection assays are based on whole antigens with multiple epitopes, which show greater sensitivity, but cross-reactions are often observed. On the other hand, epitopespecific antibody response assays are not commonly used, because it is well established that genetic background can influence the specificity of B-cell responses [13]; therefore, simple epitopes are rarely used as markers because of the difficulty in selecting common motifs that recognize broad immune responses of animals. However, the development of novel epitopes through Phage Display (PD) technology [14] has become possible, especially because selected mimotopes that mimic natural antigenic determinants are mainly originated from dominant responses, and selection favors highly reactive motifs, due to their optimized structure or functional properties [15]. Importantly, selected stable short peptide sequences assessed for tight binding to antibodies, receptors or proteins may present potential applications in diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines [16,17]. \n\nBecause of the importance of the carrier animal in disease transmission, and also due to the difficulty in producing total purified antigens from infected erythrocyte cultures, an effective diagnostic test with synthetic peptides may be an interesting alternative tool to reduce disease transmission and economic losses. Therefore, in this present study, we have selected peptides through PD against a monoclonal antibody that targets the major surface protein 1a (MSP1a) in order to map its epitope and to develop new mimotopes that are more effective than the native epitope in detecting antibody responses in cattle against A. marginale. We have also proposed a bioeletrode conjugated to the epitope to detect antibodies in crude serum by electrochemistry, which may become the basis of novel biosensors based on a specific-epitope antibody response detection that can be used in field conditions due to its flexibility, easiness, fastness, and low cost.",

Presently, for detection of biothreat agents various microbiological methods and biotests are being used. However, these methods take several hours to days for completion. Hence, real-time detectors or fast diagnostic methods are urgently needed to detect the presence of bioagents 69 . A new approach of fast detection includes use of phage antibody i.e., phage recombinants that display specific antibodies against a particular antigen. These phage antibodies can further be tagged with markers or fluorescent dye for quick and easy detection 70 . In addition to these, phage derived probes have been successfully used for detection of B. anthracis spores and S. typhimurium cells 69,71 . With latest discoveries and advancement in the field of biotechnological, phage therapy can be customised for targeting its host Fig. 3. For example, enzyme endolysin that is responsible for lysis of bacteria in bacteriophage can be over expressed in vitro, purified for direct administration, instead of using whole phage. Other use of biotechnology in phage therapy is to genetically modify phage for delivering specific molecules acting as antimicrobials 73 . Likewise, phage display technique is also a unique approach for synthesising polypeptides with novel characteristics. The concept of phage display is to express protein over the surface of phage particle, formed by fusing DNA that encodes the polypeptide with coat protein gene 74 . Phage's like M13, lambda and T7 are being used for phage display technique. The peptide displayed over phage can be used for drug designing, mimicking as receptor, to create library of highly specific proteins and also as a curative agent by hampering receptor-ligand interaction 74 . \n\npreserving, antibacterial agent and efficient candidate for phage therapy against biothreat agents. Phage therapy can be a safe, efficient and natural alternative to drug resistance antimicrobial. It is thus important to identify emerging biothreat agents along with other MDR bacteria and to isolate their specific phages and to store them for their use when required.",

            "text": "ABSTRACT Phage display antibody libraries are a rich resource for discovery of potential therapeutic antibodies. Single-chain variable fragment (scFv) libraries are the most common format due to the efficient display of scFv by phage particles and the ease by which soluble scFv antibodies can be expressed for high-throughput screening. Typically, a cascade of screening and triaging activities are performed, beginning with the assessment of large numbers of E. coli-expressed scFv, and progressing through additional assays with individual reformatting of the most promising scFv to full-length IgG. However, use of high-throughput screening of scFv for the discovery of full-length IgG is not ideal because of the differences between these molecules. Furthermore, the reformatting step represents a bottle neck in the process because each antibody has to be handled individually to preserve the unique VH and VL pairing. These problems could be resolved if populations of scFv could be reformatted to full-length IgG before screening without disrupting the variable region pairing. Here, we describe a novel strategy that allows the reformatting of diverse populations of scFv from phage selections to full-length IgG in a batch format. The reformatting process maintains the diversity and variable region pairing with high fidelity, and the resulted IgG pool enables high-throughput expression of IgG in mammalian cells and cell-based functional screening. The improved process led to the discovery of potent candidates that are comparable or better than those obtained by traditional methods. This strategy should also be readily applicable to Fab-based phage libraries. Our approach, Screening in Product Format (SiPF), represents a substantial improvement in the field of antibody discovery using phage display.",

            "text": "Antibodies leverage on their unique architecture to bind with an array of antigens. The strength of interaction has a direct relation to the affinity of the antibodies towards the antigen. In vivo affinity maturation is performed through multiple rounds of somatic hypermutation and selection in the germinal centre. This unique process involves intricate sequence rearrangements at the gene level via molecular mechanisms. The emergence of in vitro display technologies, mainly phage display and recombinant DNA technology, has helped revolutionize the way antibody improvements are being carried out in the laboratory. The adaptation of molecular approaches in vitro to replicate the in vivo processes has allowed for improvements in the way recombinant antibodies are designed and tuned. Combinatorial libraries, consisting of a myriad of possible antibodies, are capable of replicating the diversity of the natural human antibody repertoire. The isolation of target-specific antibodies with specific affinity characteristics can also be accomplished through modification of stringent protocols. Despite the ability to screen and select for high-affinity binders, some \u2018fine tuning\u2019 may be required to enhance antibody binding in terms of its affinity. This review will provide a brief account of phage display technology used for antibody generation followed by a summary of different combinatorial library characteristics.

            "text": "another library (such as the yeast-displayed system), as reported previously (13). However, screening through a proteome-wide system was rarely reported. In the present study, we have introduced a rapid procedure for phagebased panning through a non-comparative natural proteomewide system. Different from the traditional panning strategies described above, we targeted human plasma proteome for the ligand screening strategy (also called the \"library against proteome\" strategy).\n\nTo overcome the difficulty in antigen characterization for each positive binder, we have adopted a new technique of phage cross-linking for our panning process. Usually, after a specific phage clone is isolated from the library, its ligand fragment is separately produced and immobilized to a support matrix for further use. However, in 1998, a new technique was developed to make soluble phages into an insoluble aggregate by directly cross-linking pVIII capsid proteins of filamentous phages (14) with cross-linkers. As the specific ligand is genetically fused on the phage surface, the aggregate serves as an effective affinity absorbent to purify the target antigen. Because of the high efficiency of library screening and the convenience of phage amplification, the direct availability of phage particles as affinity materials will represent a considerable reduction in cost, time, and efforts for proteins purification, and therefore facilitate highthroughput purification. We have modified the cross-linking approach to further reduce the cost.\n\nIn our strategy (Fig. 1), panning was carried out in solution using biotin/streptavidin beads. In each round of panning, phage particles with specific ligands bound to plasma proteins were enriched. Multiple ligands to various targets could be obtained simultaneously during the same round of phage library screening. In contrast to the difficulty in isolating antigens, monoclonal phage antibodies could be easily achieved by plating on dishes. Individual clones were picked up from the repertoire and cultured. The specificity of mono-phages for antigen proteins was examined by ELISA, 2 and then positive mono-phages were prepared as cross-linked matrices to purify the corresponding antigen from plasma proteome. Purified antigens were identified with peptide sequence tag technology by matrix-assisted laser des",

This proved to be the case with the aF1 antibodies here described, thus limiting their use as detection reagents. Therefore we investigated the possibility of using phage-bound antibodies -i.e. filamentous phage-displayed scFvs-tailoring the subsequent immunoassays to this antibody format. We prepared multivalent phagemid particles displaying either one of our eight aF1 scFvs (CT1 through 8) or anti Lysozyme scFv (CTD1.3) using the helper plasmid system M13cp-CT previously developed in our laboratory [9]. This system has been shown to produce high titers of multivalent phagemid particles. Rapid normalization of CT phage concentrations used in any given experiment was achieved by SDS-PAGE band densitometry based on the intensity of the major protein p8. This way of assessing phage concentrations was preferred to the most commonly used phage titration based on determination of colony forming unit (cfu), in order to avoid artifacts due to multivalent display, namely lower titers caused by reduced phage infectivity [16]. Phage concentrations determined using densitometry versus titration were, as expected, mostly higher (CT3, CT5, CT8, D1.3) and ranged between 3610 +13 and 8610 +11 as shown in Table S1. \n\nThe most convenient way to assay the reactivity of our scFv-phage reagents was flow cytometry using fluorescently labeled phagemid particles. We used two labeling methods: in the first bound phage was stained with aM13 primary antibody and PE-conjugated secondary antibody, while in the second phage was directly labeled with fluorescein, prior to binding, using a previously described protocol [17] that resulted in each phagemid particle being labeled with about 50-500 fluorophores (Table S2).",

This technique has been used in biotechnology for several applications such as: directed evolution [21], identification of ligand binding sites (protein-protein, protein-ligand and protein-DNA interactions) [20], selection of monoclonal antibodies [22], protein-based drug discovery [23], development of epitope-based diagnostic tools, identification of B-cell epitopes [24] and for vaccine development [19,25]. Filamentous phages (M13, fd, and f1), lytic phages (T4 and T7) and the temperate phage lambda (\u03bb) have been successfully used as display systems [10,19,20,26].

Target antigens were also identified by performing enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) to recombinant forms of known surface antigens. The nine scFvs identified from phage display cell panning and screening against MDA-MB-231 cells were reformatted as human IgG1. These antibodies, in addition to the 20 hybridoma-derived antibodies, were used to immunoprecipitate their target antigens from MDA-MB-231 lysate. Where specific proteins were immunoprecipitated the proteins were analysed by peptide mass fingerprinting and specific peptides were analysed by MS/MS. From the nine phage display-derived IgGs analysed, one (11%) immunoprecipitated a specific protein that was identified as CD73 ( Figure 2A). From the 20 hybridoma-derived IgGs analysed, 16 (80%) immunoprecipitated specific proteins; seven immunoprecipitated integrin \u03b13\u03b21, five immunoprecipitated integrin \u03b12\u03b21, 3 immunoprecipitated CD44 and one immunoprecipitated galectin-3. The eight phage display-derived antibodies and the four hybridoma-derived antibodies that did not immunoprecipitate specific proteins were analysed for binding, by ELISA, to known surface antigens. From this analysis, six of the phage displayderived antibodies bound EGFR. Hence, 66% of the phage display-derived antibodies, with the desired characteristics, bound a single target. No targets were identified that were bound by antibodies isolated from both processes.\n\nThe additional 109 phage display-derived scFvs, which were isolated against a wider panel of breast carcinoma cells and cell lines, including SK-BR-3, T47D, BT-474, MCF7, MDA-MB-453 and primary breast carcinoma cells",

            "text": "Phage display technology can be considered a subtractive proteomic strategy for the selection of specific molecules without known targets. This is due to its combinatorial nature, favoring the random binding to several molecules. It is, for this reason, an important tool for the identification of biomolecules because it exposes a large variety of ligands to many targets at the same time and requires only minimal knowledge of the starting proteome/immunome target [37]. However, this technology has a great disadvantage: only linear or simple cyclic peptides can be incorporated into phage pIII protein [38]. \n\nSince there was the possibility of the phage binding on components of the screening system such as plastic, magnetic bead, protein G [39], or irrelevant IgG, we performed a subtractive selection twice using IgG from a binding assay of healthy controls before selection with IgG from Alzheimer's patients. This precaution was taken to avoid the selection of peptides binding in the background. \n\nOur selection and analysis strategy resulted in the identification of ten potential mimotopes recognized by the IgG present in the serum of patients with AD. It was possible to select peptides by phage display and prevalidate them as  potential new products for specific diagnosis of thyroid cancer [34], neurocysticercosis [40,41], leishmaniasis, dengue, and leprosy [42]. The peptides selected in this work are also new potential tools for developing specific serum diagnostics for AD. Evaluation with large samples will be necessary for validation in serum platforms such as the ELISA assay. \n\nAutoantibodies are important for AD progression. Patients with AD have a low titer of serum levels of the anti-beta-amyloid antibodies (A1-42, A1-15 and A16-30) compared with age matched non-AD controls [43]. Antibodies against A have potential use in AD treatment [44,45]. However, the action of the autoantibodies on other neuroproteins is still unclear. \n\nThe putative epitopes of the self-antigens, using the mimotopes, were mapped and are presented in Table 2.",

The inevitable, but unpredictable emergence of new infectious diseases has become a global threat. HIV/AIDS, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and the more recent H1N1 influenza are only a few of the numerous examples of emerging infectious diseases in the modern era. However despite advances in diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines, there is need for more specific, efficacious, cost-effective and less toxic treatment and preventive drugs. In this chapter, we discuss a powerful combinatorial technology in association with animal immunisation that is capable of generating biologic drugs with high affinity, efficacy and limited off-site toxicity, and diagnostic tools with great precision. Although time consuming, immunisation still remains the preferred route for the isolation of high-affinity antibodies and antibody-like fragments. Phage display is a molecular diversity technology that allows the presentation of large peptide and protein libraries on the surface of filamentous phage. The selection of binding fragments from phage display libraries has proven significant for routine isolation of invaluable peptides, antibodies, and antibody-like domains for diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Here we highlight the many benefits of combining immunisation with phage display in combating infectious diseases, and how our knowledge of antibody engineering has played a crucial role in fully exploiting these platforms in generating therapeutic and diagnostic biologics towards antigenic targets of infectious organisms.",

            "text": "We show here that massively parallel sequencing can significantly empower the analysis of phage-displayed antigen-specific libraries during selection with serum antibodies. From a technical standpoint, our data confirm previous studies showing that next generation sequencing can improve the resolution of methods using phage or ribosome display libraries [19,20,21,22,23,24]. However, while most of these studies focused on the discovery of peptide [19,20,21,24] and antibody [22] ligands for various targets, the present report deals with the identification of the antigen regions preferentially targeted by polyclonal responses. Moreover, our library, as well as the one used by Larman et al. [23], contained sequences obtained from natural repertories, while most of the studies cited above used random peptides libraries, whose results are sometimes difficult to interpret particularly when used in conjunction with polyclonal sera. We believe that, particularly for our application and the one described by Larman et al. [23], the use of next generation sequencing may be instrumental not only in increasing the resolution of the assay, but also in moving it from research to clinical laboratories. In this respect, the PROFILER technology, seems amenable to applications in all fields of serology, including the diagnosis of infectious, autoimmune and neoplastic diseases. Serology has been traditionally concerned with determining the amount of antibodies directed against a chosen antigen. We show here that -by combining the versatility of phage display with the power of next generation sequencing -it is also possible to obtain, in a time frame close to that of traditional serological techniques (i.e. within two days), precise qualitative and quantitative information about the regions of the antigen molecule that are targeted by a serum antibody response. Clearly, future studies will be needed to ascertain whether PROFILER will be useful in diagnostic testing and whether specific immunodominance patterns can be linked to well-defined pathologic features or to vaccine efficacy. \n\nThere is a great need, in vaccine research and diagnostic medicine, for rapid and simple methods to identify B cell epitopes [25]. Moreover, epitope characterization is important in the context of drug design [26].",

Their unique advantageous properties make Nbs highly attractive in various applications. The general approach to obtain Nbs is to isolate them from immune libraries by phage display technology. However, it is unfeasible when the antigens are toxic, lethal, transmissible or of low immunogenicity. Na\u00efve libraries could be an alternative way to solve the above problems.ResultsWe constructed a large camel na\u00efve phage display Nanobody (Nb) library with great diversity. The generated library contains to 6.86\u2009\u00d7\u20091011 clones and to our best of knowledge, this is the biggest na\u00efve phage display Nb library. Then Nbs against human procalcitonin (PCT) were isolated from this library. These Nbs showed comparable affinity and antigen-binding thermostability at 37\u00b0C and 60\u00b0C compared to the PCT Nbs from an immune phage-displayed library. Furthermore, two PCT Nbs that recognize unique epitopes on PCT have been successfully applied to develop a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect PCT, which showed a linear working range from 10-1000\u00a0ng/mL of PCT.ConclusionWe have constructed a large and diverse na\u00efve phage display Nb library, which potentially functioning as a good resource for selecting antigen-binders with high quality. Moreover, functional Nbs against PCT were successfully characterized and applied, providing great values on medical application.",

            "text": "We also purified IgG fractions corresponding to the conventional heavy and light chain subclass versus the heavy chain-only subclasses and assayed them for immunoreactivity against the individual target proteins by ELISA. Once a sufficient titer was achieved, we obtained whole blood and isolated the leukocytes to use as source of total RNA that served as a template for RT-PCR to specifically amplify cDNAs corresponding to the IgG heavy-chain variable fragments. These cDNAs were ligated into the pComb3XSS phagemid which allows for expression of the cDNA-encoded nAbs as PIII protein fusions on the pili of phage (Andris-Widhopf et al., 2000). We subjected this phage display library (complexity \u00bb 8 \u00c2 10 7 ) to panning against the individual purified recombinant target proteins immobilized in wells of a microtiter plate. Bound and eluted phage were assayed by phage ELISA against the individual target proteins, which demonstrated substantial enrichment of immunoreactivity after one round of panning (not shown). We also used 'sandwich' panning, in which wells of a microtiter plate were coated with pooled IgG fractions purified from the immunized llama to capture and display the individual recombinant target protein fragments. The bound and eluted phage from sandwich panning were subjected to two more rounds of sandwich panning. Table 1 contains a summary of the outcome of the phage display. \n\nIsolated phage were used to infect fresh cultures of E. coli bacteria ER2738 which were plated onto bacterial culture plates, from which single colonies were isolated and grown in liquid culture to express and secrete soluble nAbs. After centrifugation to remove bacteria, we validated the resultant nAb-containing bacteria culture supernatants (BC supes) by conventional ELISA against wells of microtiter plates coated with the respective purified recombinant target protein fragments. We next isolated phagemid DNA from the ELISA-positive bacterial colonies for sequencing. A summary of the results from these efforts is shown in Table 1.",

Scott, Simon Fraser University) [38]. Screening of the phage library was performed according to the method described by Smith [39]. The library was initially depleted of phages recognized by na\u0131 \u00a8ve mouse serum by 3 sequential pannings of the library with immobilized serum of non-immunized mice. The resultant ''depleted'' library was used for mimotope identification. Similarly, the sera obtained from immunized mice were initially depleted of anti-phage activity by overnight incubation at 4uC with wild type phage immobilized on plastic plates. The sera were also depleted of IgM by similar incubation with immobilized anti-IgM antibody. Serum specific peptides were selected by two rounds of iterative affinity selection and specificity of phages for different mouse sera was assessed by dot blot (according to the method described in [40]). Briefly, phages were immobilized onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were then blocked with 5% non-fat milk in TBS and probed with depleted mouse sera (1:1000 in TBS/0.5% non-fat milk). Bound antibodies were detected using goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with HRP and the ECL chemiluminescent reagent. DNAs from the serum-specific phages were subsequently purified and the pVIII inserts were sequenced and translated to amino acids for further analysis.",

            "text": "Several major studies have proven that with appropriate application of this technology, specifi c antibodies can be raised to proteins, peptides, haptens and even carbohydrates. In the most exemplary studies, antibodies have been raised with equivalent affi nities to those associated with a strong humoral immune response [ 12 -15 ]. Additionally, antibodies with suboptimal affi nities can provide useful starting molecules for the construction of mutagenized libraries which can be further screened for affi nity matured variants [ 16 -18 ]. \n\nIn addition to the affi nity maturation process, phage display also provides a useful tool for the production of ultra-humanized antibodies from nonhuman sources. It is widely accepted that there are intrinsic diffi culties associated with the humanization of nonhuman antibodies using CDR grafting. Frequently, such grafted antibodies suffer from immunogenicity associated with high non-germ-line amino acid content, the propensity for v-domain destabilization, and very often downstream expression and formulation issues. In a recent study, ultra-humanized antibodies from three nonhuman sources were generated via singlestep complementarity-determining region (CDR) germ-lining in a process termed \" Augmented Binary Substitution\" (ABS) [ 19 ]. This process utilizes phage display for selection from germline targeting combinatorial libraries which results in the identifi cation of CDR residues amenable to human germ-lining without compromising on specifi city and affi nity. A further degree of complexity is incorporated into the library through the random substitution of CDR-H3 residues in tandem with the germ-lining process. This simple single pass process generates signifi cantly lower non-germline sequence content, on CDR grafts from nonhuman hosts, rendering them virtually indistinguishable from fully human antibodies. This process opens up new possibilities for the affi nity maturation and humanization of antibodies from alternative sources such as chickens. \n\nRecombinant antibodies are typically displayed and expressed in \"fragment\" forms.",

Through analysis of selected antibodies it is possible to determine the precise constant kinetics of the antigen-antibody binding. \n\nIn the same way scFv format antibodies are produced against haptens, proteins, carbohydrates, receptors, tumor antigens or viruses. They find application in therapy or in a variety of diagnostic kits. \n\nAntibodies for therapeutic/clinical use may also be linked with cytostatic drugs (antibody--drug conjugates, ADCP) or radioisotopes for more effective delivery to target tissues. Phage Display technology is successfully used by many pharmaceutical companies in their scientific quest for biological drugs. Examples of commercially available human therapeutic antibodies obtained with Phage Display technique are: Humira (adalimumab) -an antibody directed against tumor necrosis factor a (TNFa) which -among others -is applied in the management of rheumatoid arthritis and Benlysta (belimumab) -human IgG1 directed against the B lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS), a soluble ligand of the TNF family cytokines, which are used in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus. Under clinical trials are other antibodies from phage libraries [14]. \n\nThe validity and effectiveness of Phage Display technique for obtaining high-specificity human antibodies of therapeutic potential have been confirmed. Other technologies have also been developed based on chimeric monoclonal antibodies in which the mouse antibody is \"humanized\".",

In this review, we focus on the use of phage libraries, which display antibody fragments, for generating recombinant antibodies to membrane proteins. Such affinity reagents generally have high specificity and affinity for their targets. They have been used for cell staining, for promoting protein crystallization to solve three-dimensional structures, for diagnostics, and for treating diseases as therapeutics. We cover publications on this topic from the past 10 years, with a focus on the various formats of membrane proteins for affinity selection and the diverse affinity selection strategies used.

            "text": "Since then, different yeast antibody libraries were constructed to display full-length antibodies as well as antibody fragments such as scFvs and fragment antigen-binding region (Fabs) [28][29][30]. Several antibodies have also been successfully isolated against different targets through yeast display [31][32][33][34]. Additionally, mammalian cells have been used to display scFv or whole Immunoglobulin Gs (IgGs) [35][36][37][38][39][40], allowing isolation of high affinity antibodies with specific biological functions [37,38]. Each display system has its advantages and disadvantages, however, determining those are beyond the scope of this review. Here, we will instead focus on the most popular type of antibody display, the phage display. \n\nIn phage display, filamentous phage strains such as M13, f1 and fd are the most commonly used types of phage, since they are stable, easy to manipulate and capable of keeping the infected cells intact during their life cycle [41][42][43][44]. Filamentous phage is a flexible cylindrical shaped virus particle that consists of circular single-stranded DNA (6407-base), coated with five different coat proteins (pIII, pVIII, pVI, pVII and pIX) [45,46]. Although all the aforementioned coat proteins can be fused with a product to construct phage display libraries, pIII-fused products are the most commonly used. The pIII is able to display large protein sequences such as scFv and Fab [44,47,48], and the crystal structure of pIII shows that it is willing to accept peptide or protein without losing its function, due to the structural flexibility [49]. \n\nThere are more than 100,000 publications and 80,000 patents related to phage display documented in the three decades since Smith's seminal report in 1985 [50]. Some blockbuster drugs, with annual sales beyond US$1 billion, such as Lucentis and Humira, have been isolated using phage display [51]. The latter is considered the highest selling drug globally, with total sales of US$11 billion since it was launched in 2002 [51].",

            "text": "The immune libraries are obtained from immunized animals or humans and are mostly used to discover antibodies against infectious pathogens (Trott et al., 2014) or antigenic targets in cancer patients (Thie et al., 2011;Frenzel et al., 2016). This library contains a restricted antibody repertoire that underwent antigen-driven in vivo selection (Barbas et al., 1991;Orum et al., 1993;Frenzel et al., 2016), which differs from the other phage display libraries, known as \"universal\", that theoretically provide binders for all possible antigen structures (Frenzel et al., 2016). The na\u00efve antibody libraries are generated from a pool of B lymphocytes of non-immunized donors, and one successful example is the scFv library licensed from Cambridge Antibody Technology (CAT; now part of MedImmune/AstraZeneca) (Javle et al., 2014;Almagro et al., 2019). While the na\u00efve libraries are derived from natural antibody gene repertoires, the synthetic ones are entirely based on in silico design to obtain individual antibody amino acid sequences (Fuh, 2007), bypassing the need to isolate antibody genes. The semisynthetic libraries, on the other hand, are created using both naturally and synthetically (in silico) randomized CDRs. In this library type, it is possible to redesign natural CDRs to improve the chance of finding antibodies with high specificity and affinity (Orum et al., 1993;Fuh, 2007). \n\nBuilding the phage display library is the most important step of this technology. There is a directly proportional relationship between the size of the antibody library and the probability of finding a particular antibody (Burioni et al., 1997;Almagro et al., 2019). The Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) is an important tool to analyze the variability, the sequence composition, and the size of antibody phage display libraries (Rouet et al., 2018). The construction of a phage display library is more expensive than generating hybridomas after animal immunization. However, the antibody screening step of the phage display method is faster and cheaper (Hentrich et al., 2018).",

            "text": "An alternative to the use of traditional immunization to generate antibodies has been the use of in vitro display methods [37] to select antibodies from large na\u00efve or immune libraries. In these techniques, large antibody libraries in either the Fab or single chain Fv (scFv) format [38] are displayed on the surface of filamentous phage [39,40] or yeast [41,42], and antibodies binding targets of interest are purified away from the multitude of non-binding antibodies. Targets are usually immobilized and the binding antibodies separated from non-binding antibodies by a series of washing steps, followed by elution. The selection of antibodies from vast antibody libraries, instead of using animal immunization and hybridoma technology, offers the advantage of guiding the selection process towards antibodies with rare specificities, epitopes or characteristics that are extremely difficult to find with animal-based methods. The key feature of in vitro display systems is that phenotype (the displayed antibody) and genotype (the gene encoding the displayed antibody) are coupled in such a way that selection of an antibody on the basis of its binding activity leads to simultaneous selection of the gene that encodes it. This guarantees the permanent availability of selected clones over time, by virtue of gene synthesis, and also makes it possible to express clones in different antibody formats (e.g., with Fc domains from different species), as well as improve antibody properties, such as affinity. Furthermore, recombinantly expressed antibodies have been shown to be more specific than their hybridoma expressed counterparts, which often express additional immunoglobulin chains that detract from their specificity [43]. \n\nIn general, the larger the library, the higher the affinity of antibodies that can be selected, although this tends to be target specific, with protein targets generally yielding much higher affinities than small targets such as mycolactone. We developed a recombinatorial method [44,45] to create particularly large phage antibody libraries, from which human antibodies against a number of challenging targets have been generated [46][47][48]. Here we describe the application of this approach to select human antibodies recognizing mycolactone.",

            "text": "Phage display represents the most used technique for the identification of targeting peptides. It is defined as in vivo since it relies on the use of bacteriophages, which are bacterial viruses that can be easily genetically engineered. The method uses peptide libraries fused within the genome of filamentous phages, such as M13 bacteriophages, to express the peptides fused with other capsid proteins. Different capsid proteins can be used for this purpose, and in particular, the pIII protein is the most exploited [8]. The importance of this method earned its inventors the Nobel Prize in 2018 [35]. Additionally, in this case, the phages, suitably modified to express peptide libraries, are used to identify the sequences most affine to a target protein in a process called bio-panning that, like the two-hybrid one, involves several rounds of selection and enrichment until a few highly related sequences are obtained [36]. When the solution with viral particles, each one having a single peptidic sequence fused with a capsid protein, is ready, it is put in contact with the target protein, which, in this case, is immobilized on a support. Only phages with the peptides related to the target protein remain attached, while the others are washed away [36]. These bounded phages are collected and amplified through bacterial infection. The \"new\" library is used for the following round of selection, until few sequences are obtained [36]. The technique is very laborious and time-consuming and requires the production of large amounts of the target protein, but most of the targeting peptides with diagnostic and targeting applications have been identified through this method [8,[37][38][39]. For example, a 7-residue peptide was identified by Bakhshinejad and Sadeghizadeh using a commercial library, which was able to target colon carcinoma cells with no significant binding to normal cells [40]. Other peptides were identified to improve the binding affinity of antibodies for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 variants and increase their neutralization potency [41].",

Two libraries of na\u00efve human single chain variable fragments (scFv), each created independently from different donors, and a library of llama variable domain of heavy chain only antibodies (VHH) were included to increase diversity, aiming to expose the small (<30 amino acid) GPR65 ECL epitopes to advantageous antibody formats and diversity. \n\nAs peptides were acting as the antigen, the panning strategy was designed to increase efficiency by pooling all three constructs, each representing one of the GPR65 ECL, as well as maintaining a high concentration throughout the three panning rounds. Importantly, the epitopes of interest presented by the chimeric constructs were a small portion of the whole protein, therefore throughout the later panning rounds, subtraction pans were also incorporated. WT ApoE3 (Figure 2a, yellow boxes) was used to remove backbone binders and encourage only those recognizing the substituted loops of interest to become enriched. \n\nOnce panning was complete, monoclonal antibodies were rescued, and antibody-containing supernatant were screened by ELISA, identifying 163 antigen-specific binders (Figure 2b). Of the antibodies derived from the VHH library, the subtraction pan did not appear to enrich loopspecific binders, resulting in more from those not exposed to WT ApoE3. The scFv libraries led to a higher hit rate of antigen-specific antibodies; with enrichment of loop-specific antibodies through the inclusion of a subtraction step (at either rounds 2 or 3) and resulted in fewer ApoE3 backbone binders. The additional panning round for scFv libraries over the VHH library was due to library size differences (Figure 2b). Upon phagemid DNA amplification by PCR, sequencing analysis identified 28 unique antibodies, 26 derived from the scFv libraries, and 2 from the VHH phage library.",

            "text": "Recombinant antibodies recognizing MET928 were generated by phage display using two rounds of panning on immobilized antigen. Binders were generated using a previously described human antibody phage display library of ~10 10 clones formatted as single chain Fvs (scFvs) 33 . The selected population was affinity matured en masse by chain-shuffling the selected population of VH genes 34 . A chain-shuffled scFv library of 10 9 clones was constructed and was subjected to stringent selection using biotinylated MET928 to allow the emergence of new VH/VL combinations with potentially superior binding properties to the original. In addition to affinity-based approaches, a \"competitive elution\" selection was performed in parallel in which MET-bound phage populations were incubated with high (micromolar) concentrations of the ligand HGF/SF in an effort to elute HGF/ SF-competitive antibodies. Selected populations were cloned into a bacterial expression vector 35 and individual clones were screened directly for functional activity using a colony scatter assay. Hits emerging from this screen were assessed in a more quantitative cell migration assay, based on migration of fluorescently labeled SKOV3 human ovarian cancer cells using a Boyden chamber. A number of clones were identified that inhibited HGF/ SF-induced migration of SKOV3 cells, including clone 7A2 (Supplementary Figure S1) which emerged from \"competitive elution\" selections. This clone was antagonistic for ligand-induced MET activation but also exhibited a degree of agonism when tested in the absence of added ligand. Specifically, a \"bell-shaped\" curve, similar to that seen with the natural ligand, was observed with peak agonistic activity around 1 nM 7A2 scFv and a maximum peak height which was lower than that induced by HGF/SF (Fig. S1). It has previously been shown that anti-Met antibodies presented in a bivalent format can display agonistic activity 37 . It is also known that scFv molecules can form dimers and other higher order structures. Separation of monomeric scFv from larger species revealed that agonistic activity in scFv preparations was associated with larger, non-monomeric species (data not shown).",

Bacteriophage lambda, representing a classical molecular cloning and expression system has also been exploited for generating large combinatorial libraries of small peptides and protein domains exposed on its capsid. More recently, lambda display has been consistently and successfully employed for domain mapping, antigen discovery and protein interaction studies or, more generally, in functional genomics. We show here the results obtained by the use of large libraries of cDNA and genomic DNA for the molecular dissection of the human B-cell response against complex pathogens, including protozoan parasites, bacteria and viruses. Moreover, by reviewing the experimental work performed in recent investigations we illustrate the potential of lambda display in the diagnostics field and for identifying antigens useful as targets for vaccine development.",

Polypeptides are displayed as phage coat protein fusions and the corresponding gene is contained within the particle. It is usually mediated by the fusion of the displayed polypeptide to a coat protein, and encapsulating the gene encoding the fusion protein within the phage particle. This coupling of phenotype and genotype ensures that selection of the displayed protein simultaneously selects the encoding gene, allowing further selection rounds and the eventual isolation of a population highly enriched in phage displaying polypeptides of interest. Vectors based on filamentous Ff phage are the most popular, and of the five coat proteins, the gene 3 protein (g3p) is most commonly used for display. \n\nThere are two broad categories of vectors used for phage display: phage and phagemid. When proteins are displayed using phage vectors, which are not of the 33 or 88 kind, the bacteria produce phage particles that all display recombinant protein. The gene encoding the recombinant displayed protein is included in the phage genome and as a result the phage population produced by a single clone is phenotypically and genotypically homogenous, excluding the effects of proteolysis. In contrast, phagemid make recombinant displayed protein, but require the additional proteins provided by helper phage to create phage particles that display recombinant protein. Helper phage are essential for phagemid systems as they supply all the other proteins required to make functional phage.",

            "text": "The second protocol is employed to identify the most promising hits or binders of interest within this pool, usually through a phage ELISA or an inhibition assay. \n\nIn addition to the steps outlined in the biopanning process, it is essential to highlight the importance of performing a subtractive selection using antibodies from negative samples. This critical step aims to eliminate non-specific binders in the library and clones that may bind to the constant part of the antibodies. To mitigate any potential interference during the panning process, it is recommended to add these antibodies to the phage library. One approach to achieving this is by incubating the serum sample on a surface coated with helper phages (e.g., for phagemid M13) or the original phage without an insert (e.g., for T7 phage) This effectively removes phage-specific antibodies before further utilization. \n\nAfter obtaining the selected hits, it is important to optimize them if needed, possibly through techniques like site-directed mutagenesis. Subsequently, a thorough characterization of the hits is necessary to assess their antibody binding capability, their potential to elicit an immune response, and the effectiveness of that immune response. \n\nThe epitopes of a pathogen identified through phage display have diverse applications, including the development of diagnostic tests, understanding pathogen-host interactions, and the creation of therapeutics such as monoclonal antibodies, small molecule inhibitors, and vaccines. \n\nMoreover, numerous studies have employed phage display techniques in the context of infectious diseases, using two key components: a phage display library and antibodies from samples taken from infected, convalescent, or vaccinated individuals. For instance, in the case of hepatitis A virus (HAV), mimotopes were identified using antibodies from hepatitis A patients. One of the identified phages exhibited the ability to hinder the attachment of anti-HAV antibodies, eliciting a specific immune response in mice. Similarly, phage display libraries were utilized to discover mimotopes of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen (HBsAg), leading to the generation of highly specific antibodies in vaccinated mice. Furthermore, mimotopes of the human hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein were identified using serum from an HCV-infected patient.",

Hence, neutralizing the TcdA and TcdB activities can be considered as an efficient therapeutic approach against C. difficile infection (CDI). In this work, we utilized phage display technique to select single-chain fragment variable (scFv) fragments as recombinant antibodies displayed on the surface of phages, which specifically target native TcdA, or TcdB (nTcdA and nTcdB), and their recombinant C-terminal combined repetitive oligopeptide (CROP) domains (rTcdA and rTcdB). After three rounds of biopanning, abundance of phage clones displaying high reactivity with TcdA or TcdB was quantified through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Furthermore, selected scFvs were characterized by cell viability and neutralization assays.

            "text": "ABSTRACT TcdA and TcdB are known as the major virulence attributes of Clostridioides difficile. Hence, neutralizing the TcdA and TcdB activities can be considered as an efficient therapeutic approach against C. difficile infection (CDI). In this work, we utilized phage display technique to select single-chain fragment variable (scFv) fragments as recombinant antibodies displayed on the surface of phages, which specifically target native TcdA, or TcdB (nTcdA and nTcdB), and their recombinant C-terminal combined repetitive oligopeptide (CROP) domains (rTcdA and rTcdB). After three rounds of biopanning, abundance of phage clones displaying high reactivity with TcdA or TcdB was quantified through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Furthermore, selected scFvs were characterized by cell viability and neutralization assays. The gene expression of immunological markers, IL-8 and TNF-\u03b1, was examined in treated Caco-2 cells by RT-qPCR. The epitopes of neutralizing scFvs were also identified by molecular docking.

HOS is associated with a poor prognosis. Using the human antibody phage library, we obtained 95 types of antibody clones against HMOS cell lines and developed a fluorescence probe-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that enables high-throughput screening of the reactivity of these antibodies. The lysate of the HMOS cell line was incubated with the selected antibody, and the antigen\u2013antibody complex was recovered using magnetic beads. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) analysis of the sample bands extracted from gel electrophoresis detected CAVIN1/PTRF specifically in HMOS cells. This novel high-throughput screening assay using antibody\u2013drug conjugate targeting for these specific proteins is promising for clinical applications. Abstract Osteosarcoma is a malignant tumor that produces neoplastic bone or osteoid osteoma. In human multicentric osteosarcoma (HMOS), a unique variant of human osteosarcoma (HOS), multiple bone lesions occur simultaneously or asynchronously before lung metastasis. HMOS is associated with an extremely poor prognosis, and effective treatment options are lacking. Using the proteins in our previously generated HMOS cell lines as antigens, we generated antibodies using a human antibody phage library.

            "text": "Simple Summary Human multicentric osteosarcoma (HMOS) is a variant of human osteosarcoma (HOS) in which multiple bone lesions occur simultaneously or asynchronously before lung metastasis. HOS is associated with a poor prognosis. Using the human antibody phage library, we obtained 95 types of antibody clones against HMOS cell lines and developed a fluorescence probe-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that enables high-throughput screening of the reactivity of these antibodies. The lysate of the HMOS cell line was incubated with the selected antibody, and the antigen\u2013antibody complex was recovered using magnetic beads. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) analysis of the sample bands extracted from gel electrophoresis detected CAVIN1/PTRF specifically in HMOS cells. This novel high-throughput screening assay using antibody\u2013drug conjugate targeting for these specific proteins is promising for clinical applications. Abstract Osteosarcoma is a malignant tumor that produces neoplastic bone or osteoid osteoma. In human multicentric osteosarcoma (HMOS), a unique variant of human osteosarcoma (HOS), multiple bone lesions occur simultaneously or asynchronously before lung metastasis. HMOS is associated with an extremely poor prognosis, and effective treatment options are lacking. Using the proteins in our previously generated HMOS cell lines as antigens, we generated antibodies using a human antibody phage library. We obtained antibody clones recognizing 95 independent antigens and developed a fluorescence probe-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique capable of evaluating the reactivity of these antibodies by fluorescence intensity, allowing simple, rapid, and high-throughput selection of antibody clones. These results were highly correlated with those using flow cytometry. Subsequently, the HMOS cell lysate was incubated with the antibody, the antigen\u2013antibody complex was recovered with magnetic beads, and the protein bands from electrophoresis were analyzed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS).

Until now there has not been antibodies for visualizing parechovirus infection. We used E. coli recombinant PeV-A1-VP0 protein as a target in phage display single chain variable fragment (scFv) antibody library panning. Three rounds of panning allowed identification and isolation of several candidate scFv clones, which tested positive in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) against VP0. Three scFv clones (scFv-55, -59 and -71) with different CDR-3 sequences were further purified and tested in ELISA, Western blot and immunofluorescence microscopy (IFA) against a set of PeV-A1 isolates and a few isolates representing PeV types 2\u20136. In IFA, all three scFv binders recognized twenty PeV-A1 isolates. ScFv-55 and -71 also recognized clinical representatives of PeV types 1\u20136 both in IFA and in capture ELISA, while scFv-59 only recognized PeV-A1, -A2 and -A6. PeV-A1-VP0 (Harris strain) sequence was used to generate a peptide library, which allowed identification of a putative unique conformational antibody epitope with fully conserved flanking regions and a more variable core VVTYDSKL, shared between the scFv antibodies. Sequencing of the VP0 region of virus samples and sequence comparisons against parechoviral sequences in GenBank revealed 107 PeV-A1, -A3, -A8, -A17, -A (untyped) sequences with this exact epitope core sequence, which was most dominant among PeV-A1 isolates.

The current treatment, horse serum-derived antivenom, has unpredictable side effects and presents manufacturing challenges. This study focused on developing new-generation snake venom antidotes by using microbial phage display technology to derive nanobodies from an alpaca immunized with attenuated N. atra venom. Following confirmation of the immune response in the alpaca, we amplified VHH genes from isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells and constructed a phage display VHH library of 1.0 \u00d7 107 transformants. After four rounds of biopanning, the enriched phages exhibited increased binding activity to N. atra venom. Four nanobody clones with high binding affinities were selected: aNAH1, aNAH6, aNAH7, and aNAH9. Specificity testing against venom from various snake species, including two Southeast Asian cobra species, revealed nanobodies specific to the genus Naja. An in vivo mouse venom neutralization assay demonstrated that all nanobodies prolonged mouse survival and aNAH6 protected 66.6% of the mice from the lethal dosage. These findings highlight the potential of phage display-derived nanobodies as valuable antidotes for N. atra venom, laying the groundwork for future applications in snakebite treatment.

Here, we report for the first time the selection and identification of peptide mimotopes of Trypanosoma evansi RoTat 1.2 variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) for their potential uses in surra diagnostics and multi\u2010epitope vaccine research. First, we produced the mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), designated as 2E11 (IgG1) and 1C2 (IgG1), against the antigens in T. evansi RoTat 1.2 lysates. We then used 2E11 mAb to immunoprecipitate the target antigen. The immunoprecipitated antigen was then identified to be the VSG by mass spectrometry. Both 2E11 and 1C2 mAbs reacted with the VSG in immunoblots. The surface plasmon resonance immunosensors developed with both the mAbs detected VSG in the parasite lysates as well as in the rodent sera. Further, the mAbs were biotinylated and used in three rounds of panning to select peptide mimotopes from the random peptide phage display library (PhD\u201012; New England Biolabs, USA). The phage clones selected against each mAb were amplified and tested by phage capture ELISA for specificity. The peptide coding regions of the selected phages were sequenced and the protein blast search of the deduced amino acid sequences was performed by accessing the non\u2010redundant protein database at https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/.

As a natural host of various zoonotic pathogens, the Philippine carabao (Bubalus kerabau Fitzinger, 1860) offers great potential as a surrogate model for molecular biology and biomedical applications. However, studies on its antibody repertoire are very scarce, if not available. Hence, this study was undertaken to design and evaluate degenerate primers targeting the antigen-binding paratope of B. kerabau Fitzinger, 1860 IgM \u2013 specifically, lambda variable light chain (VLL), kappa variable light chain (VLK), and variable heavy chain (VH). These primers were mainly based on carabao\u2019s close relative in the Bovidae family, the cattle (Bos taurus). A total of 32 degenerate primers, 14 designed and 18 adapted from literature, were used to amplify the target antibody fragments using a high-fidelity DNA polymerase with a modified touchdown\u2013polymerase chain reaction method. Results demonstrate the amplification of VLL, VLK, and VH genes derived from B-cells of carabao splenic tissues using the degenerate primers. The amplicons will be used in the construction of an antibody phage library to elucidate the IgM repertoire of the Philippine carabao. In addition, DNA sequencing surprisingly revealed longer VLL and VLK genes than VH genes in contrast to what is found in other bovines, suggesting a novel organization of immunoglobulin genes of B. kerabau Fitzinger, 1860 that merits further investigation.",

Individually cloned heavy and light chain variable region libraries were combined in an efficient two-step cloning procedure, permitting the cloning of a total of 3.7 \u00d7 1010 independent Fab clones. The performance of the library was determined by the successful selection of on average 14 different Fabs against 6 antigens tested. These include tetanus toxoid, the hapten phenyl-oxazolone, the breast cancer-associated MUC1 antigen, and three highly related glycoprotein hormones: human chorionic gonadotropin, human luteinizing hormone, and human follicle-stimulating hormone. In the latter category, a panel of either homone-specific or cross-reactive antibodies were identified. The design of the library permits the monitoring of selections with polyclonal phage preparations and to carry out large scale screening of antibody off-rates with unpurified Fab fragments on BIAcore. Antibodies with off-rates in the order of 10\u22122 to 10\u22124s\u22121 and affinities up to 2.7 nm were recovered. The kinetics of these phage antibodies are of the same order of magnitude as antibodies associated with a secondary immune response.

                    "[22482975 | Lebani et al. | 2017 | Citations: 31]": "The multidimensional nature of dengue virus (DENV) infections, which can be caused by four distinct serotypes of the virus, complicates the sensitivity of assays designed for the diagnosis of infection. Different viral markers can be optimally detected at different stages of infection. Of particular clinical importance is the early identification of infection, which is pivotal for disease management and the development of blood screening assays. Non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is an early surrogate marker of infection and its detection in serum coincides with detectable viraemia. The aim of this work was to isolate and characterise serotype-specific monoclonal antibodies that bind to NS1 for each of the four DENV serotypes. This was achieved using phage display and a subtractive biopanning strategy to direct the antibody selection towards serotype-specific epitopes. This antibody isolation strategy has advantages over immunisation techniques where it is difficult to avoid antibody responses to cross-reactive, immunodominant epitopes. Serotype specificity to recombinant antigen for each of the antibodies was confirmed by Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) and Surface Plasmon Resonance. Confirmation of binding to native DENV NS1 was achieved using ELISA and immunofluorescence assay on DENV infected Vero cells. No cross-reactivity with Zika or Kunjin viruses was observed. A previously isolated pan-reactive antibody that binds to an immunodominant epitope was able to pair with each of the serotype-specific antibodies in a sandwich ELISA, indicating that the serotype specific antibodies bind to epitopes which are all spatially distinct from the immunodominant epitope. These antibodies were suitable for use in a multiplexed assay for simultaneous detection and serotyping of DENV NS1 in human serum. This work demonstrates that phage display coupled with novel biopanning strategies is a valuable in vitro methodology for isolation of binders that can discern amongst antigens with high homology for diagnostic applicability.",

Unfortunately, their large size, unstable behavior, and random immobilization properties create numerous problems. The single-domain antigen-binding fragment derived from heavy-chain antibodies of camelids (termed VHH) offers special advantages in terms of size, stability, and ease of generating different antibody constructs. In this study, we show the potential of those VHHs in sensing human prostate-specific antigen (hPSA) by SPR technology. Different VHH constructs were immobilized onto commercial and custom-built sensor surfaces by metal chelation, biotin-streptavidin interaction, or covalent coupling. The detection of subnanogram per milliliter hPSA concentrations could be attained on a covalently coupled three-dimensional dextran surface. Moreover, the ratio of different hPSA isoform concentrations could be assessed via a sandwich assay and resulted in the detection of clinically significant antigen concentrations within 15 min. In addition, for the first time, the intrinsic protein stability is presented as an important probe design factor, since our results reveal that higher intrinsic stability offers higher resistance to harsh regeneration conditions. In conclusion, we present VHHs as a novel class of biosensor probes rivaling conventional antibodies and their derived antibody fragments.",

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is usually determined by immunoassay, by which antibodies are frequently used as the specific probes. Herein we found that more advanced probes against free prostate-specific antigen (f-PSA) can be screened from the landscape phage library. Four phage monoclones were selected and identified by the specificity array. One phage clone displaying the fusion peptide ERNSVSPS showed good specificity and affinity to f-PSA and was used as a PSA capture probe in a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) array. An anti-human PSA monoclonal antibody (anti-PSA mAb) was used to recognize the captured antigen, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (HRP-IgG) and o-phenylenediamine, which were successively added to develop plate color. The ELISA conditions such as effect of blocking agent, coating buffer pH, phage concentration, antigen incubation time, and anti-PSA mAb dilution for phage ELISA were optimized. On the basis of the optimal phage ELISA conditions, the absorbance taken at 492 nm on a microplate reader was linear with f-PSA concentration within 0.825-165 ng/mL with a low limit of detection of 0.16 ng/mL. Thus, the landscape phage is an attractive biomolecular probe in bioanalysis.",

The binding affinity of gold-immobilized peptides for TnI was studied and compared with that of phage-immobilized peptides. Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), cyclic voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were used to monitor both the immobilization and target binding processes. All three techniques show that the binding is specific for TnI as compared to a streptavidin (SA) control. The response curves obtained at TnI concentrations ranging from 0 to 10 \u03bcg/mL, using both QCM and EIS, were also compared. For the EIS measurements, the sensitivity was 0.30 \u00b1 0.030 normalized impedance/(\u03bcg/mL) and the limit of detection (LOD) was 0.34 \u03bcg/mL. Using the QCM, a sensitivity of 18 \u00b1 1 Hz/(\u03bcg/mL) was obtained, corresponding to an LOD of 0.11 \u03bcg/mL. Although the QCM demonstrated a lower LOD as compared to EIS, the latter technique exhibited a larger linear dynamic range than QCM. In a relevant tissue culture milieu, Minimum Essential Media (MEM), the sensitivity of the EIS measurement was greater than that obtained in a phosphate buffer system (PBS). The kinetics of target binding using QCM were analyzed by two independent methods, and the dissociation constants (K(D) = 66 \u00b1 4 nM and 17 \u00b1 8 nM) were an order of magnitude higher than that calculated for the polyvalent phage particles (K(D) = 2.5 \u00b1 0.1 nM). Even though the affinity of the immobilized peptides for TnI was somewhat reduced, overall, these results demonstrate that peptides obtained from the biopanning of phage display libraries can be readily used as sensing probes in biosensor development.",

Here we present a platform where short unstructured peptides that bind to a desired target are selected using M13 phage display. The selected peptides are then chemically synthesized and immobilized on gold, allowing for detection of the target using electrochemical techniques such as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). A quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) is also used as a diagnostic tool during biosensor development. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by creating a novel peptide-based electrochemical biosensor for the enzyme alanine aminotransferase (ALT), a well-known biomarker of hepatotoxicity. Biopanning of the M13 phage display library over immobilized ALT, led to the rapid identification of a new peptide (ALT5-8) with an amino acid sequence of WHWRNPDFWYLK. Phage particles expressing this peptide exhibited nanomolar affinity for immobilized ALT (Kd,app\u200a=\u200a85\u00b120 nM). The newly identified ALT5-8 peptide was then chemically synthesized with a C-terminal cysteine for gold immobilization. The performance of the gold-immobilized peptides was studied with cyclic voltammetry (CV), QCM, and EIS. Using QCM, the sensitivity for ALT detection was 8.9\u00b10.9 Hz/(\u00b5g/mL) and the limit of detection (LOD) was 60 ng/mL. Using EIS measurements, the sensitivity was 142\u00b112 impedance percentage change %/(\u00b5g/mL) and the LOD was 92 ng/mL. In both cases, the LOD was below the typical concentration of ALT in human blood. Although both QCM and EIS produced similar LODs, EIS is preferable due to a larger linear dynamic range. Using QCM, the immobilized peptide exhibited a nanomolar dissociation constant for ALT (Kd\u200a=\u200a20.1\u00b10.6 nM). These results demonstrate a simple and rapid platform for developing and assessing the performance of sensitive, peptide-based biosensors for new protein targets.",

Rare phage are selected from the repertoire by binding to antigen; soluble antibody fragments are expressed from infected bacteria; and the affinity of binding of selected antibodies is improved by mutation. The process mimics immune selection, and antibodies with many different binding specificities have been isolated from the same phage repertoire. Thus human antibody fragments have been isolated with specificities against both foreign and self antigens, including haptens, carbohydrates, secreted and cell surface proteins, viral coat proteins, and intracellular antigens from the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and the nucleus.

Current antibody drugs have increasingly fewer adverse effects due to their high specificity. As a result, therapeutic antibodies have become the predominant class of new drugs developed in recent years. Over the past five years, antibodies have become the best-selling drugs in the pharmaceutical market, and in 2018, eight of the top ten bestselling drugs worldwide were biologics. The global therapeutic monoclonal antibody market was valued at approximately US$115.2 billion in 2018 and is expected to generate revenue of $150 billion by the end of 2019 and $300 billion by 2025. Thus, the market for therapeutic antibody drugs has experienced explosive growth as new drugs have been approved for treating various human diseases, including many cancers, autoimmune, metabolic and infectious diseases. As of December 2019, 79 therapeutic mAbs have been approved by the US FDA, but there is still significant growth potential. This review summarizes the latest market trends and outlines the preeminent antibody engineering technologies used in the development of therapeutic antibody drugs, such as humanization of monoclonal antibodies, phage display, the human antibody mouse, single B cell antibody technology, and affinity maturation. Finally, future applications and perspectives are also discussed."

They created combinatorial antibody libraries on filamentous phage to be utilized for generating antigen specific antibodies in a matter of weeks. Since then, more than 70 phage\u2013derived antibodies entered clinical studies and 14 of them have been approved.

Antimicrobial peptides have proven very effective against a variety of multidrug-resistant bacteria. Additionally, the low levels of resistance reported towards these molecules are an attractive feature for antimicrobial drug development. Here we summarise information on diverse peptide libraries used to discover or to optimize antimicrobial peptides. Chemical synthesized peptide libraries, for example split and mix method, tea bag method, multi-pin method and cellulose spot method are discussed. In addition biological peptide library screening methods are summarized, like phage display, bacterial display, mRNA-display and ribosomal display. A few examples are given for small peptide libraries, which almost exclusively follow a rational design of peptides of interest rather than a combinatorial approach.",

In this context, antiviral peptides constitute a promising area for disease prevention and treatment. The identification and development of these inhibitory peptides require the high-throughput screening of combinatorial libraries. Phage-display is a powerful technique for selecting unique molecules with selective affinity for a specific target from highly diverse combinatorial libraries. In the last 15 years, the use of this technique for antiviral purposes and for the isolation of candidate inhibitory peptides in drug discovery has been explored. We present here a review of the use of phage display in antiviral research and drug discovery, with a discussion of optimized strategies combining the strong screening potential of this technique with complementary rational approaches for identification of the best target. By combining such approaches, it should be possible to maximize the selection of molecules with strong antiviral potential.",

Phages are heavily utilized in bioengineering for applications ranging from tissue engineering scaffolds to immune signal delivery. Of specific interest to vaccines and immunotherapies, phages have demonstrated an ability to activate both the innate and adaptive immune systems. The genome of these viral particles can be harnessed for DNA vaccination, or the surface proteins can be exploited for antigen display. More specifically, genes that encode an antigen of interest can be spliced into the phage genome, allowing antigenic proteins or peptides to be displayed by fusion to phage capsid proteins. Phages therefore present antigens to immune cells in a highly ordered and repetitive manner. This review discusses the use of phage with adjuvanting activity as antigen delivery vehicles for vaccination against infectious disease and cancer.",

This allows M13 bacteriophages to build a homogeneous distribution and infiltrate the network structure of nanostructures under mild conditions. Phage display, involving the genetic engineering of M13 bacteriophages, is another strong feature of the M13 bacteriophage as a functional building block. The numerous genetic modification possibilities of M13 bacteriophages are clearly the key features, and far more applications are envisaged.

There are two general paradigms in pathogen detection: molecular and immuno-based, and phage-based detection is a third emerging paradigm due to its sensitivity and selectivity. Molecular detection methods look for genetic material specific for a given pathogen in a sample usually by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Immuno-methods look at the pathogen components (antigens) by antibodies raised against that pathogen specific antigens. There are different variations and products based on these two paradigms with advantages and disadvantages. The third paradigm at least for bacterial pathogen detection entails bacteriophages specific for a given bacterium. Sensitivity and specificity are the two key parameters in any pathogen detection system. By their very nature, bacteriophages afford the best sensitivity for bacterial detection. Bacteria and bacteriophages form the predator-prey pair in the evolutionary arms race and has coevolved over time to acquire the exquisite specificity of the pair, in some instances at the strain level. This specificity has been exploited for diagnostic purposes of various pathogens of concern in clinical and other settings. Many recent reviews focus on phage-based detection and sensor technologies. In this review, we focus on a very special group of pathogens that are of concern in biodefense because of their potential misuse in bioterrorism and their extremely virulent nature and as such fall under the Centers for Disease and Prevention (CDC) Category A pathogen list. We describe the currently available phage methods that are based on the usual modalities of detection from culture, to molecular and immuno- and fluorescent methods. We further highlight the gaps and the needs for more modern technologies and sensors drawing from technologies existing for detection and surveillance of other pathogens of clinical relevance."

Michael Kierny and Thomas Cunningham contributed equally In the search for biomarkers, recombinant affinity reagents can be generated to candidate proteins or post-translational modifications that differ qualitatively or quantitatively between normal and diseased tissues. The use of display technologies, such as phage-display, allows for manageable selection and optimization of affinity reagents for use in biomarker detection. Here we review the use of recombinant antibody fragments, such as scFvs and Fabs, which can be affinity-selected from phage-display libraries, to bind with both high specificity and affinity to biomarkers of cancer, such as Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2 (HER2) and Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). We discuss how these recombinant antibodies can be fabricated into nanostructures, such as carbon nanotubes, nanowires, and quantum dots, for the purpose of enhancing detection of biomarkers at low concentrations (pg/mL) within complex mixtures such as serum or tissue extracts. Other sensing technologies, which take advantage of \u2018Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering\u2019 (gold nanoshells), frequency changes in piezoelectric crystals (quartz crystal microbalance), or electrical current generation and sensing during electrochemical reactions (electrochemical detection), can effectively provide multiplexed platforms for detection of cancer and injury biomarkers.

Over the past three decades, antibodies have emerged as an essential asset in successful cancer therapy. The major obstacle in developing anti-cancer antibodies is the need for non-immunogenic antibodies against human antigens. This unique requirement highlights a disadvantage to using traditional hybridoma technology and thus demands alternative approaches, such as humanizing murine monoclonal antibodies. To overcome these hurdles, human monoclonal antibodies can be obtained directly from Phage Display libraries, a groundbreaking tool for antibody selection. These libraries consist of genetically engineered viruses, or phages, which can exhibit antibody fragments, such as scFv or Fab on their capsid. This innovation allows the in vitro selection of novel molecules directed towards cancer antigens. As foreseen when Phage Display was first described, nowadays, several Phage Display-derived antibodies have entered clinical settings or are undergoing clinical evaluation. This comprehensive review unveils the remarkable progress in this field and the possibilities of using clever strategies for phage selection and tailoring the refinement of antibodies aimed at increasingly specific targets. Moreover, the use of selected antibodies in cutting-edge formats is discussed, such as CAR (chimeric antigen receptor) in CAR T-cell therapy or ADC (antibody drug conjugate), amplifying the spectrum of potential therapeutic avenues.",

Individually cloned heavy and light chain variable region libraries were combined in an efficient two-step cloning procedure, permitting the cloning of a total of 3.7 \u00d7 1010 independent Fab clones. The performance of the library was determined by the successful selection of on average 14 different Fabs against 6 antigens tested. These include tetanus toxoid, the hapten phenyl-oxazolone, the breast cancer-associated MUC1 antigen, and three highly related glycoprotein hormones: human chorionic gonadotropin, human luteinizing hormone, and human follicle-stimulating hormone. In the latter category, a panel of either homone-specific or cross-reactive antibodies were identified. The design of the library permits the monitoring of selections with polyclonal phage preparations and to carry out large scale screening of antibody off-rates with unpurified Fab fragments on BIAcore. Antibodies with off-rates in the order of 10\u22122 to 10\u22124s\u22121 and affinities up to 2.7 nm were recovered. The kinetics of these phage antibodies are of the same order of magnitude as antibodies associated with a secondary immune response. This new phage antibody library is set to become a valuable source of antibodies to many different targets, and to play a vital role in target discovery and validation in the area of functional genomics."

To accommodate the increased interest in biomedical applications of antibodies, antibody phage display technology has provided an alternative for rapid discovery and broad utilisation of novel, highly specific and fully human antibodies (Schirrmann et al., 2011).\n\nSince the introduction of monoclonal antibody technology by Kohler and Milstein in 1975, antibodies have become important biomolecules due to their capability to be applied in various fields, and most importantly in diagnostic, therapeutics, and vaccine development (Nissim et al., 2008). The potential of applications of na\u00efve antibodies isolated from na\u00efve libraries in diagnostics had been demonstrated in few publications. Isolated scFv and Fab antibody fragments against native spores of Bacillus subtilis IFO 3336 were labelled with two different fluorescent dyes (FITC or rhodamine-N-hydroxysuccinimide) for direct and indirect detection by fluorescence microscope. The detection signal was greatly amplified when fluorescent dye was labelled to the highcopy number of phage coat protein pVIII of the antibody phage particles. Direct detection of individual spores was made possible by fluorescent-labelled antibody-phage clones (Zhou et al., 2002). These spore binding antibodies could be further incorporated into other detection systems such as high-flow-rate fluidized bed as solid phase capture (Weimer et al., 2001), electrochemiluminescent immunoassay (ECLIA) (Yu, 1998), and magnetic particle fluorogenic immunoassay (MPFIA) (Yu, 1998).\n\nAnother example was demonstrated by L. acidophilus species specific scFv isolated with phage display technology. The resulting scFvs isolated was applied in FACS for enrichment of L. acidophilus which resulted in more than 99.8% genome coverage. It was envisioned that this species specific antibodies could be applied to enrich low abundance organism in a community which could lead to better taxonomic identification and genome recovery prior to genome sequencing [143].",

In the early days, it was postulated that this technique would eventually replace hybridoma technology and animal immunisations. However, since this technology emerged more than 20 years ago, there have only been a handful reports on the construction and application of phage display antibody libraries world-wide.ResultsHere we report the simplest and highly efficient method for the construction of a highly useful human single chain variable fragment (scFv) library. The least number of oligonucleotide primers, electroporations and ligation reactions were used to generate a library of 1.5 \u00d7 108 individual clones, without generation of sub-libraries. All possible combinations of heavy and light chains, among all immunoglobulin isotypes, were included by using a mixture of primers and overlapping extension PCR. The key difference from other similar libraries was the highest diversity of variable gene repertoires, which was derived from 140 non-immunized human donors. A wide variety of antigens were successfully used to affinity select specific binders. These included pure recombinant proteins, a hapten and complex antigens such as viral coat proteins, crude snake venom and cancer cell surface antigens. In particular, we were able to use standard bio-panning method to isolate antibody that can bind to soluble Aflatoxin B1, when using BSA-conjugated toxin as a target, as demonstrated by inhibition ELISA.ConclusionThese results suggested that by using an optimized protocol and very high repertoire diversity, a compact and efficient phage antibody library can be generated. This advanced method could be adopted by any molecular biology laboratory to generate both na\u00efve or immunized libraries for particular targets as well as for high-throughput applications."

To accommodate the increased interest in biomedical applications of antibodies, antibody phage display technology has provided an alternative for rapid discovery and broad utilisation of novel, highly specific and fully human antibodies (Schirrmann et al., 2011).\n\nSince the introduction of monoclonal antibody technology by Kohler and Milstein in 1975, antibodies have become important biomolecules due to their capability to be applied in various fields, and most importantly in diagnostic, therapeutics, and vaccine development (Nissim et al., 2008). The potential of applications of na\u00efve antibodies isolated from na\u00efve libraries in diagnostics had been demonstrated in few publications. Isolated scFv and Fab antibody fragments against native spores of Bacillus subtilis IFO 3336 were labelled with two different fluorescent dyes (FITC or rhodamine-N-hydroxysuccinimide) for direct and indirect detection by fluorescence microscope. The detection signal was greatly amplified when fluorescent dye was labelled to the highcopy number of phage coat protein pVIII of the antibody phage particles. Direct detection of individual spores was made possible by fluorescent-labelled antibody-phage clones (Zhou et al., 2002). These spore binding antibodies could be further incorporated into other detection systems such as high-flow-rate fluidized bed as solid phase capture (Weimer et al., 2001), electrochemiluminescent immunoassay (ECLIA) (Yu, 1998), and magnetic particle fluorogenic immunoassay (MPFIA) (Yu, 1998).\n\nAnother example was demonstrated by L. acidophilus species specific scFv isolated with phage display technology. The resulting scFvs isolated was applied in FACS for enrichment of L. acidophilus which resulted in more than 99.8% genome coverage. It was envisioned that this species specific antibodies could be applied to enrich low abundance organism in a community which could lead to better taxonomic identification and genome recovery prior to genome sequencing [143]."

Instead of utilization of monoclonal antibody (mAb) and chemically bond DNA that required in the conventional IPCR, a recombinant phage particle is applied as a ready reagent for IPCR experiment. The surface displayed single chain variable fragment (scFv) and phage DNA themselves can directly serve as detection antibody and PCR template, respectively. The aim of the design is to overcome shortcoming of low detection sensitivity of scFv so as to largely facilitate the real application of scFv in immunoassay. The idea has been demonstrated by applying hantaan virus nucleocapsid protein (NP) and prion protein (PrP) as detection targets in three experimental protocols (indirect, sandwich and real-time PD-IPCR assays).

Methods We tested 272 serum samples from patients with dengue disease. Of these, 222 were from patients with acute infection of one of the four dengue serotypes, detected by RT-PCR and/or virus isolation. Forty-eight acute-phase serum samples from patients not infected with dengue virus were also included. Results The sensitivity of the Platelia Dengue NS1 Ag test on acute serum samples (n\u200a=\u200a222) was 87.4% (95% confidence interval: 82.3% to 91.5%); that of Dengue NS1 Ag STRIP was 81.5% (95% CI: 75.8% to 86.4%) after 15 minutes and 82.4% (95% CI: 76.8% to 87.2%) after 30 minutes.

It frequently causes an invasive aspergillosis (IA) in immunocompromised patients with poor prognosis. Potent antifungal drugs are very expensive and cause serious adverse effects. Their correct application requires an early and specific diagnosis of IA, which is still not properly achievable. This work aims to a specific detection of A. fumigatus by immunofluorescence and the generation of recombinant antibodies for the detection of A. fumigatus by ELISA. Results The A. fumigatus antigen Crf2 was isolated from a human patient with proven IA. It is a novel variant of a group of surface proteins (Crf1, Asp f9, Asp f16) which belong to the glycosylhydrolase family. Single chain fragment variables (scFvs) were obtained by phage display from a human naive antibody gene library and an immune antibody gene library generated from a macaque immunized with recombinant Crf2. Two different selection strategies were performed and shown to influence the selection of scFvs recognizing the Crf2 antigen in its native conformation. Using these antibodies, Crf2 was localized in growing hyphae of A. fumigatus but not in spores. In addition, the antibodies allowed differentiation between A. fumigatus and related Aspergillus species or Candida albicans by immunofluorescence microscopy. The scFv antibody clones were further characterized for their affinity, the nature of their epitope, their serum stability and their detection limit of Crf2 in human serum. Conclusion Crf2 and the corresponding recombinant antibodies offer a novel approach for the early diagnostics of IA caused by A. fumigatus."

                            "Antibody fragments of predetermined binding specificity have recently been constructed from repertoires of antibody V genes, bypassing hybridoma technology and even immunization. The V gene repertoires are harvested from populations of lymphocytes, or assembled in vitro, and cloned for display of associated heavy and light chain variable domains on the surface of filamentous bacteriophage. Rare phage are selected from the repertoire by binding to antigen; soluble antibody fragments are expressed from infected bacteria; and the affinity of binding of selected antibodies is improved by mutation. The process mimics immune selection, and antibodies with many different binding specificities have been isolated from the same phage repertoire. Thus human antibody fragments have been isolated with specificities against both foreign and self antigens, including haptens, carbohydrates, secreted and cell surface proteins, viral coat proteins, and intracellular antigens from the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and the nucleus. Such antibodies have potential as reagents for research and in therapy."

They are the most profitable single product class, where they represent six of the top ten selling drugs. At the beginning of the 1990s, an in vitro antibody selection technology known as antibody phage display was developed by John McCafferty and Sir. Gregory Winter that enabled the discovery of human antibodies for diverse applications, particularly antibody-based drugs. They created combinatorial antibody libraries on filamentous phage to be utilized for generating antigen specific antibodies in a matter of weeks. Since then, more than 70 phage\u2013derived antibodies entered clinical studies and 14 of them have been approved. These antibodies are indicated for cancer, and non-cancer medical conditions, such as inflammatory, optical, infectious, or immunological diseases. This review will illustrate the utility of phage display as a powerful platform for therapeutic antibodies discovery and describe in detail all the approved mAbs derived from phage display."

                            "Accurate pathogen detection and diagnosis is paramount in clinical success of treating patients. There are two general paradigms in pathogen detection: molecular and immuno-based, and phage-based detection is a third emerging paradigm due to its sensitivity and selectivity. Molecular detection methods look for genetic material specific for a given pathogen in a sample usually by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Immuno-methods look at the pathogen components (antigens) by antibodies raised against that pathogen specific antigens. There are different variations and products based on these two paradigms with advantages and disadvantages. The third paradigm at least for bacterial pathogen detection entails bacteriophages specific for a given bacterium. Sensitivity and specificity are the two key parameters in any pathogen detection system. By their very nature, bacteriophages afford the best sensitivity for bacterial detection. Bacteria and bacteriophages form the predator-prey pair in the evolutionary arms race and has coevolved over time to acquire the exquisite specificity of the pair, in some instances at the strain level. This specificity has been exploited for diagnostic purposes of various pathogens of concern in clinical and other settings. Many recent reviews focus on phage-based detection and sensor technologies. In this review, we focus on a very special group of pathogens that are of concern in biodefense because of their potential misuse in bioterrorism and their extremely virulent nature and as such fall under the Centers for Disease and Prevention (CDC) Category A pathogen list. We describe the currently available phage methods that are based on the usual modalities of detection from culture, to molecular and immuno- and fluorescent methods. We further highlight the gaps and the needs for more modern technologies and sensors drawing from technologies existing for detection and surveillance of other pathogens of clinical relevance."

Michael Kierny and Thomas Cunningham contributed equally In the search for biomarkers, recombinant affinity reagents can be generated to candidate proteins or post-translational modifications that differ qualitatively or quantitatively between normal and diseased tissues. The use of display technologies, such as phage-display, allows for manageable selection and optimization of affinity reagents for use in biomarker detection. Here we review the use of recombinant antibody fragments, such as scFvs and Fabs, which can be affinity-selected from phage-display libraries, to bind with both high specificity and affinity to biomarkers of cancer, such as Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2 (HER2) and Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). We discuss how these recombinant antibodies can be fabricated into nanostructures, such as carbon nanotubes, nanowires, and quantum dots, for the purpose of enhancing detection of biomarkers at low concentrations (pg/mL) within complex mixtures such as serum or tissue extracts. Other sensing technologies, which take advantage of \u2018Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering\u2019 (gold nanoshells), frequency changes in piezoelectric crystals (quartz crystal microbalance), or electrical current generation and sensing during electrochemical reactions (electrochemical detection), can effectively provide multiplexed platforms for detection of cancer and injury biomarkers. Such devices may soon replace the traditional time consuming ELISAs and Western blots, and deliver rapid, point-of-care diagnostics to market."

(Huang et al., 2005)(Saerens et al., 2005) Also, various peptide binders against protein targets have been selected by phage display, for example, for the development of biosensors applied to the analysis of protein targets, such as cholera toxin, (Lim et al., 2018) troponin I, (Wu et al., 2010) prostate-specific antigen, (Lang et al., 2014) norovirus capsid proteins, (Hwang et al., 2017)110 alanine aminotransferase, (Wu et al., 2011) and sepsis (Park et al., 2015) or dengue fever biomarkers. (Lim et al., 2018) ecently, a SERS biosensor based on M13 phages that display cysteine-rich peptides on the pVIII was developed for triplex assay in sepsis diagnosis. The assays on magnetic templates with picomolar detection limits was described as a promising alternative for early clinical diagnosis of sepsis. (Nguyen et al., 2016)"

                            "The multidimensional nature of dengue virus (DENV) infections, which can be caused by four distinct serotypes of the virus, complicates the sensitivity of assays designed for the diagnosis of infection. Different viral markers can be optimally detected at different stages of infection. Of particular clinical importance is the early identification of infection, which is pivotal for disease management and the development of blood screening assays. Non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is an early surrogate marker of infection and its detection in serum coincides with detectable viraemia. The aim of this work was to isolate and characterise serotype-specific monoclonal antibodies that bind to NS1 for each of the four DENV serotypes. This was achieved using phage display and a subtractive biopanning strategy to direct the antibody selection towards serotype-specific epitopes. This antibody isolation strategy has advantages over immunisation techniques where it is difficult to avoid antibody responses to cross-reactive, immunodominant epitopes. Serotype specificity to recombinant antigen for each of the antibodies was confirmed by Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) and Surface Plasmon Resonance. Confirmation of binding to native DENV NS1 was achieved using ELISA and immunofluorescence assay on DENV infected Vero cells. No cross-reactivity with Zika or Kunjin viruses was observed. A previously isolated pan-reactive antibody that binds to an immunodominant epitope was able to pair with each of the serotype-specific antibodies in a sandwich ELISA, indicating that the serotype specific antibodies bind to epitopes which are all spatially distinct from the immunodominant epitope. These antibodies were suitable for use in a multiplexed assay for simultaneous detection and serotyping of DENV NS1 in human serum. This work demonstrates that phage display coupled with novel biopanning strategies is a valuable in vitro methodology for isolation of binders that can discern amongst antigens with high homology for diagnostic applicability."

In this context, antiviral peptides constitute a promising area for disease prevention and treatment. The identification and development of these inhibitory peptides require the high-throughput screening of combinatorial libraries. Phage-display is a powerful technique for selecting unique molecules with selective affinity for a specific target from highly diverse combinatorial libraries. In the last 15 years, the use of this technique for antiviral purposes and for the isolation of candidate inhibitory peptides in drug discovery has been explored. We present here a review of the use of phage display in antiviral research and drug discovery, with a discussion of optimized strategies combining the strong screening potential of this technique with complementary rational approaches for identification of the best target. By combining such approaches, it should be possible to maximize the selection of molecules with strong antiviral potential."

Unfortunately, their large size, unstable behavior, and random immobilization properties create numerous problems. The single-domain antigen-binding fragment derived from heavy-chain antibodies of camelids (termed VHH) offers special advantages in terms of size, stability, and ease of generating different antibody constructs. In this study, we show the potential of those VHHs in sensing human prostate-specific antigen (hPSA) by SPR technology. Different VHH constructs were immobilized onto commercial and custom-built sensor surfaces by metal chelation, biotin-streptavidin interaction, or covalent coupling. The detection of subnanogram per milliliter hPSA concentrations could be attained on a covalently coupled three-dimensional dextran surface. Moreover, the ratio of different hPSA isoform concentrations could be assessed via a sandwich assay and resulted in the detection of clinically significant antigen concentrations within 15 min. In addition, for the first time, the intrinsic protein stability is presented as an important probe design factor, since our results reveal that higher intrinsic stability offers higher resistance to harsh regeneration conditions. In conclusion, we present VHHs as a novel class of biosensor probes rivaling conventional antibodies and their derived antibody fragments."

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is usually determined by immunoassay, by which antibodies are frequently used as the specific probes. Herein we found that more advanced probes against free prostate-specific antigen (f-PSA) can be screened from the landscape phage library. Four phage monoclones were selected and identified by the specificity array. One phage clone displaying the fusion peptide ERNSVSPS showed good specificity and affinity to f-PSA and was used as a PSA capture probe in a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) array. An anti-human PSA monoclonal antibody (anti-PSA mAb) was used to recognize the captured antigen, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (HRP-IgG) and o-phenylenediamine, which were successively added to develop plate color. The ELISA conditions such as effect of blocking agent, coating buffer pH, phage concentration, antigen incubation time, and anti-PSA mAb dilution for phage ELISA were optimized. On the basis of the optimal phage ELISA conditions, the absorbance taken at 492 nm on a microplate reader was linear with f-PSA concentration within 0.825-165 ng/mL with a low limit of detection of 0.16 ng/mL. Thus, the landscape phage is an attractive biomolecular probe in bioanalysis."

                            "A small synthetic peptide with nanomolar affinity for cardiac troponin I (TnI), previously identified from a polyvalent phage displayed library, has been immobilized on a gold surface for TnI detection. The binding affinity of gold-immobilized peptides for TnI was studied and compared with that of phage-immobilized peptides. Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), cyclic voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were used to monitor both the immobilization and target binding processes. All three techniques show that the binding is specific for TnI as compared to a streptavidin (SA) control. The response curves obtained at TnI concentrations ranging from 0 to 10 \u03bcg/mL, using both QCM and EIS, were also compared. For the EIS measurements, the sensitivity was 0.30 \u00b1 0.030 normalized impedance/(\u03bcg/mL) and the limit of detection (LOD) was 0.34 \u03bcg/mL. Using the QCM, a sensitivity of 18 \u00b1 1 Hz/(\u03bcg/mL) was obtained, corresponding to an LOD of 0.11 \u03bcg/mL. Although the QCM demonstrated a lower LOD as compared to EIS, the latter technique exhibited a larger linear dynamic range than QCM. In a relevant tissue culture milieu, Minimum Essential Media (MEM), the sensitivity of the EIS measurement was greater than that obtained in a phosphate buffer system (PBS). The kinetics of target binding using QCM were analyzed by two independent methods, and the dissociation constants (K(D) = 66 \u00b1 4 nM and 17 \u00b1 8 nM) were an order of magnitude higher than that calculated for the polyvalent phage particles (K(D) = 2.5 \u00b1 0.1 nM). Even though the affinity of the immobilized peptides for TnI was somewhat reduced, overall, these results demonstrate that peptides obtained from the biopanning of phage display libraries can be readily used as sensing probes in biosensor development."

To accommodate the increased interest in biomedical applications of antibodies, antibody phage display technology has provided an alternative for rapid discovery and broad utilisation of novel, highly specific and fully human antibodies (Schirrmann et al., 2011).\n\nSince the introduction of monoclonal antibody technology by Kohler and Milstein in 1975, antibodies have become important biomolecules due to their capability to be applied in various fields, and most importantly in diagnostic, therapeutics, and vaccine development (Nissim et al., 2008). The potential of applications of na\u00efve antibodies isolated from na\u00efve libraries in diagnostics had been demonstrated in few publications. Isolated scFv and Fab antibody fragments against native spores of Bacillus subtilis IFO 3336 were labelled with two different fluorescent dyes (FITC or rhodamine-N-hydroxysuccinimide) for direct and indirect detection by fluorescence microscope. The detection signal was greatly amplified when fluorescent dye was labelled to the highcopy number of phage coat protein pVIII of the antibody phage particles. Direct detection of individual spores was made possible by fluorescent-labelled antibody-phage clones (Zhou et al., 2002). These spore binding antibodies could be further incorporated into other detection systems such as high-flow-rate fluidized bed as solid phase capture (Weimer et al., 2001), electrochemiluminescent immunoassay (ECLIA) (Yu, 1998), and magnetic particle fluorogenic immunoassay (MPFIA) (Yu, 1998).\n\nAnother example was demonstrated by L. acidophilus species specific scFv isolated with phage display technology. The resulting scFvs isolated was applied in FACS for enrichment of L. acidophilus which resulted in more than 99.8% genome coverage. It was envisioned that this species specific antibodies could be applied to enrich low abundance organism in a community which could lead to better taxonomic identification and genome recovery prior to genome sequencing [143]."

                            "There is a consistent demand for new biosensors for the detection of protein targets, and a systematic method for the rapid development of new sensors is needed. Here we present a platform where short unstructured peptides that bind to a desired target are selected using M13 phage display. The selected peptides are then chemically synthesized and immobilized on gold, allowing for detection of the target using electrochemical techniques such as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). A quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) is also used as a diagnostic tool during biosensor development. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by creating a novel peptide-based electrochemical biosensor for the enzyme alanine aminotransferase (ALT), a well-known biomarker of hepatotoxicity. Biopanning of the M13 phage display library over immobilized ALT, led to the rapid identification of a new peptide (ALT5-8) with an amino acid sequence of WHWRNPDFWYLK. Phage particles expressing this peptide exhibited nanomolar affinity for immobilized ALT (Kd,app\u200a=\u200a85\u00b120 nM). The newly identified ALT5-8 peptide was then chemically synthesized with a C-terminal cysteine for gold immobilization. The performance of the gold-immobilized peptides was studied with cyclic voltammetry (CV), QCM, and EIS. Using QCM, the sensitivity for ALT detection was 8.9\u00b10.9 Hz/(\u00b5g/mL) and the limit of detection (LOD) was 60 ng/mL. Using EIS measurements, the sensitivity was 142\u00b112 impedance percentage change %/(\u00b5g/mL) and the LOD was 92 ng/mL. In both cases, the LOD was below the typical concentration of ALT in human blood. Although both QCM and EIS produced similar LODs, EIS is preferable due to a larger linear dynamic range. Using QCM, the immobilized peptide exhibited a nanomolar dissociation constant for ALT (Kd\u200a=\u200a20.1\u00b10.6 nM). These results demonstrate a simple and rapid platform for developing and assessing the performance of sensitive, peptide-based biosensors for new protein targets."

These systems can detect a range of chemicals with excellent sensitivity and selectivity. Filaments consistent with M13 bacteriophages can be ordered by highly established forms of self-assembly. This allows M13 bacteriophages to build a homogeneous distribution and infiltrate the network structure of nanostructures under mild conditions. Phage display, involving the genetic engineering of M13 bacteriophages, is another strong feature of the M13 bacteriophage as a functional building block. The numerous genetic modification possibilities of M13 bacteriophages are clearly the key features, and far more applications are envisaged. This paper reviews the recent progress in the application of the M13 bacteriophage self-assembly structures through to sensor systems and discusses future M13 bacteriophage technology."

The use of display technologies, such as phage-display, allows for manageable selection and optimization of affinity reagents for use in biomarker detection. Here we review the use of recombinant antibody fragments, such as scFvs and Fabs, which can be affinity-selected from phage-display libraries, to bind with both high specificity and affinity to biomarkers of cancer, such as Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2 (HER2) and Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA).

Other sensing technologies, which take advantage of \u2018Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering\u2019 (gold nanoshells), frequency changes in piezoelectric crystals (quartz crystal microbalance), or electrical current generation and sensing during electrochemical reactions (electrochemical detection), can effectively provide multiplexed platforms for detection of cancer and injury biomarkers.

Beyond therapeutics, phage display has been instrumental in antibody engineering, epitope mapping, and the study of protein interactions. Additionally, it has facilitated the identification of novel peptide ligands for drug targeting, the development of biosensors for disease detection, and the creation of protein libraries for enzyme optimization and protein-protein interaction studies [9].\n\nThe phage display library finds another compelling application in the development of tumor-targeting peptides, particularly for diagnostic purposes [89]90]. These peptides play a pivotal role in creating imaging agents designed to specifically illuminate cancerous lesions. By associating with nanoparticle conjugation, these peptides not only enhance sensitivity in cancer diagnosis, but also contribute to improved contrast imaging capabilities."

We developed a phagemid format wherein antibody heavy- and light-chain variable regions were fused to the amino termini of pVII and pIX, respectively. Significantly, the fusion proteins interacted to form a functional Fv-binding domain on the phage surface. Our approach will be applicable to the display of generic peptide and protein libraries that can form combinatorial heterodimeric arrays.

                            "BackgroundVenezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) belongs to the Alphavirus group. Several species of this family are also pathogenic to humans and are recognized as potential agents of biological warfare and terrorism. The objective of this work was the generation of recombinant antibodies for the detection of VEEV after a potential bioterrorism assault or an natural outbreak of VEEV.ResultsIn this work, human anti-VEEV single chain Fragments variable (scFv) were isolated for the first time from a human na\u00efve antibody gene library using optimized selection processes. In total eleven different scFvs were identified and their immunological specificity was assessed. The specific detection of the VEEV strains TC83, H12/93 and 230 by the selected antibody fragments was proved. Active as well as formalin inactivated virus particles were recognized by the selected antibody fragments which could be also used for Western blot analysis of VEEV proteins and immunohistochemistry of VEEV infected cells. The anti-VEEV scFv phage clones did not show any cross-reactivity with Alphavirus species of the Western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV) and Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) antigenic complex, nor did they react with Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), if they were used as detection reagent.ConclusionFor the first time, this study describes the selection of antibodies against a human pathogenic virus from a human na\u00efve scFv antibody gene library using complete, active virus particles as antigen. The broad and sensitive applicability of scFv-presenting phage for the immunological detection and diagnosis of Alphavirus species was demonstrated. The selected antibody fragments will improve the fast identification of VEEV in case of a biological warfare or terroristic attack or a natural outbreak."

                            "Monoclonal antibodies are recognised as an important class of drug especially against autoimmune diseases, cancers and infectious diseases (Pansri et al., 2009)(Yamada, 2011). To accommodate the increased interest in biomedical applications of antibodies, antibody phage display technology has provided an alternative for rapid discovery and broad utilisation of novel, highly specific and fully human antibodies (Schirrmann et al., 2011).\n\nSince the introduction of monoclonal antibody technology by Kohler and Milstein in 1975, antibodies have become important biomolecules due to their capability to be applied in various fields, and most importantly in diagnostic, therapeutics, and vaccine development (Nissim et al., 2008). The potential of applications of na\u00efve antibodies isolated from na\u00efve libraries in diagnostics had been demonstrated in few publications. Isolated scFv and Fab antibody fragments against native spores of Bacillus subtilis IFO 3336 were labelled with two different fluorescent dyes (FITC or rhodamine-N-hydroxysuccinimide) for direct and indirect detection by fluorescence microscope. The detection signal was greatly amplified when fluorescent dye was labelled to the highcopy number of phage coat protein pVIII of the antibody phage particles. Direct detection of individual spores was made possible by fluorescent-labelled antibody-phage clones (Zhou et al., 2002). These spore binding antibodies could be further incorporated into other detection systems such as high-flow-rate fluidized bed as solid phase capture (Weimer et al., 2001), electrochemiluminescent immunoassay (ECLIA) (Yu, 1998), and magnetic particle fluorogenic immunoassay (MPFIA) (Yu, 1998).\n\nAnother example was demonstrated by L. acidophilus species specific scFv isolated with phage display technology. The resulting scFvs isolated was applied in FACS for enrichment of L. acidophilus which resulted in more than 99.8% genome coverage. It was envisioned that this species specific antibodies could be applied to enrich low abundance organism in a community which could lead to better taxonomic identification and genome recovery prior to genome sequencing [143]."

Colloidal gold particles were coated with monoclonal anti-T-2 antibodies and used as detector reagent, indicating the strip test results by formation of up to two colored lines in a competitive assay format. The test line comprises a protein conjugate of the T-2 mycotoxin and the control line an antispecies-specific antibody to confirm the correct test development. To perform the test, 5 g of sample was extracted in a ratio of 1:5 with methanol/water (70:30) by shaking for 3 min and the extract directly used without further cleanup steps. The T-2 toxin lateral flow device (LFD) presented has a cutoff level around 100 microg/kg for naturally contaminated wheat and oat. The semiquantitative test may be used in the lower micrograms per kilogram range and allows for rapid semiquantitative photometric classification of the level of sample contamination. For both tests, results were obtained within 4 min. The developed LFDs therefore allow for the first time fast and on-site screening for the determination of T-2 toxin in cereals."

                            "1. Cell Preparation: The goal is to prepare a sample containing as many single cells as possible. Doublets or higher order clumps will either be detected or thrown out by the cytometer, or will confuse the instrument and result in sort mistakes (resulting in reduced purity). To avoid this, cells should be filtered through a 30-100 \u03bcm nylon mesh, depending on cell size, at each step to continually remove cell aggregates. Cell aggregation occurs during centrifugation washes and can lead to tremendous losses of cells due to mega-clumps. This can be minimized by using use round bottom tubes. Do not use conical or tapered bottom tubes. Use a relatively large diameter tube e.g. 17mm. Polypropylene is the best plastic to use with cells \u2013 do not use polystyrene. Centrifuge cells only as fast as necessary to pellet. Do not leave the cells in the pellet for a significant time it is best to be at the centrifuge when it stops spinning and immediately remove tubes, decant supernatant (never suck off fluid using a pipette) and resuspend cells (hint: break pellet up before adding any additional fluid/media)."

                            "Immuno-PCR (IPCR) is a powerful detection technology in immunological study and clinical diagnosis due to its ultrasensitivity. Here we introduce a new strategy termed phage display mediated immuno-PCR (PD-IPCR). Instead of utilization of monoclonal antibody (mAb) and chemically bond DNA that required in the conventional IPCR, a recombinant phage particle is applied as a ready reagent for IPCR experiment. The surface displayed single chain variable fragment (scFv) and phage DNA themselves can directly serve as detection antibody and PCR template, respectively. The aim of the design is to overcome shortcoming of low detection sensitivity of scFv so as to largely facilitate the real application of scFv in immunoassay. The idea has been demonstrated by applying hantaan virus nucleocapsid protein (NP) and prion protein (PrP) as detection targets in three experimental protocols (indirect, sandwich and real-time PD-IPCR assays). The detection sensitivity was increased 1000- to 10 000-folds compared with conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). This proof-of-concept study may serve as a new model to develop an easy to operate, low cost and ultrasensitive immunoassay method for broad applications."

We have constructed a phage display combinatorial antibody Fab library from a patient with marginal zone B cell lymphoma associated with Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome and carrying high serum anti-EBV-VCA IgG titer. Fab fragments were selected by panning against EBV-VCA protein coated onto ELISA plates, and selected Fab clones were characterized by ELISA, western blotting (WB), indirect immunofluorescence assay and immunohistochemistry. We have established two Fab clones, Fab-aVCA1 and Fab-aVCA21, which specifically recognize EBV-VCA by ELISA and WB. Inhibition ELISA competition showed that both clones could significantly reduce the binding of specific anti-EBV-VCA mAb to its relevant proteins. Furthermore, these two Fab clones could localize VCA protein in the EBV-positive P3HR1 and Daudi cell lines, as well as in tissue samples from patients with EBV-infected lymphoid malignancies. These results indicate that our two Fab clones are novel human mAbs specific for EBV-VCA protein and may have potential benefits for development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in EBV-related lymphoid malignancies."

                "tldr": "Phage display-derived antibodies offer numerous advantages in diagnostic applications including rapid development time, high stability, specificity, and the ability to be customized for different detection platforms. These characteristics make them superior to traditional antibodies in many diagnostic contexts and have led to their growing adoption in clinical and research settings. (12 sources)",
                "text": "\nPhage display technology provides significant advantages for diagnostic applications compared to traditional antibody generation methods. One major benefit is the speed of development\u2014specific antibody fragments can be generated within weeks using phage display, whereas traditional hybridoma methods require months <Paper corpusId=\"221092042\" paperTitle=\"(Chitray et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. This rapid development is particularly valuable for responding to emerging diseases and developing new diagnostic tools in time-sensitive contexts.\n\nThe technology offers exceptional versatility through the generation of diverse antibody formats including full antibodies, single-chain variable fragments (scFv), and fragment antigen-binding (Fab) portions <Paper corpusId=\"145820057\" paperTitle=\"(Sokullu et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"1580608\" paperTitle=\"(Haard et al., 1999)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"6147420\" paperTitle=\"(Schofield et al., 2007)\" isShortName></Paper>. These smaller antibody fragments exhibit very high stability, making them uniquely suited for diagnostic applications that may involve harsh conditions or long shelf-life requirements <Paper corpusId=\"201667521\" paperTitle=\"(Reader et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nAnother significant advantage is the ability to create both immune and na\u00efve antibody libraries. While immune libraries contain antibodies specifically enriched against particular immunogens, na\u00efve libraries can be used against an unlimited array of targets without requiring immunization <Paper corpusId=\"221092042\" paperTitle=\"(Chitray et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. This flexibility eliminates the need for animal immunization, making the process more ethical and applicable to a broader range of antigens, including toxic substances.\n\nPhage display-derived antibodies can be easily customized for various diagnostic platforms. Their recombinant nature allows for genetic manipulation to optimize binding affinity, specificity, and functional properties <Paper corpusId=\"55838761\" paperTitle=\"(Ch'ng et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>. These antibodies have been successfully incorporated into diagnostic applications ranging from traditional immunoassays to advanced detection systems, including lateral-flow assays, nanoparticle-based tests, microfluidic platforms, and DNA-integrated assays <Paper corpusId=\"55838761\" paperTitle=\"(Ch'ng et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe clinical success of phage display-derived antibodies further validates their advantages in biomedical applications. Several therapeutic antibodies developed through phage display have received regulatory approval, including adalimumab (Humira) for autoimmune conditions and belimumab (Benlysta) for systemic lupus erythematosus <Paper corpusId=\"237835650\" paperTitle=\"(Lasocka et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"209523469\" paperTitle=\"(Lu et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. This clinical validation extends to diagnostic applications, with 36% of phage display-derived antibodies that have gained clinical approval being tailored for cancer applications and 32% for immunoregulation <Paper corpusId=\"261768481\" paperTitle=\"(Franca et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe diagnostic potential of phage display-derived antibodies has been demonstrated in numerous applications. For bacterial detection, these antibodies can be fluorescently labeled for direct visualization of pathogens under microscopy <Paper corpusId=\"3889492\" paperTitle=\"(Chan et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>. Additionally, they've been successfully employed in flow cytometry for enrichment and identification of bacterial species with more than 99.8% genome coverage <Paper corpusId=\"3889492\" paperTitle=\"(Chan et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"44841738\" paperTitle=\"(Schirrmann et al., 2011)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nOverall, the technology has overcome many limitations of traditional hybridoma methods, providing a versatile platform for generating highly specific antibodies and peptides against pathogens and cancer antigens for diagnostic purposes <Paper corpusId=\"270748518\" paperTitle=\"(Sadraeian et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. These advantages have positioned phage display-derived antibodies as critical components in modern diagnostic development, with applications continuing to expand in both research and clinical settings.",

                            "We report the design, construction, and use of the first very large non-immunized phage antibody library in Fab format, which allows the rapid isolation and affinity analysis of antigen-specific human antibody fragments. Individually cloned heavy and light chain variable region libraries were combined in an efficient two-step cloning procedure, permitting the cloning of a total of 3.7 \u00d7 1010 independent Fab clones. The performance of the library was determined by the successful selection of on average 14 different Fabs against 6 antigens tested. These include tetanus toxoid, the hapten phenyl-oxazolone, the breast cancer-associated MUC1 antigen, and three highly related glycoprotein hormones: human chorionic gonadotropin, human luteinizing hormone, and human follicle-stimulating hormone. In the latter category, a panel of either homone-specific or cross-reactive antibodies were identified. The design of the library permits the monitoring of selections with polyclonal phage preparations and to carry out large scale screening of antibody off-rates with unpurified Fab fragments on BIAcore. Antibodies with off-rates in the order of 10\u22122 to 10\u22124s\u22121 and affinities up to 2.7 nm were recovered. The kinetics of these phage antibodies are of the same order of magnitude as antibodies associated with a secondary immune response. This new phage antibody library is set to become a valuable source of antibodies to many different targets, and to play a vital role in target discovery and validation in the area of functional genomics."

                            "It has been more than three decades since the first monoclonal antibody was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) in 1986, and during this time, antibody engineering has dramatically evolved. Current antibody drugs have increasingly fewer adverse effects due to their high specificity. As a result, therapeutic antibodies have become the predominant class of new drugs developed in recent years. Over the past five years, antibodies have become the best-selling drugs in the pharmaceutical market, and in 2018, eight of the top ten bestselling drugs worldwide were biologics. The global therapeutic monoclonal antibody market was valued at approximately US$115.2 billion in 2018 and is expected to generate revenue of $150 billion by the end of 2019 and $300 billion by 2025. Thus, the market for therapeutic antibody drugs has experienced explosive growth as new drugs have been approved for treating various human diseases, including many cancers, autoimmune, metabolic and infectious diseases. As of December 2019, 79 therapeutic mAbs have been approved by the US FDA, but there is still significant growth potential. This review summarizes the latest market trends and outlines the preeminent antibody engineering technologies used in the development of therapeutic antibody drugs, such as humanization of monoclonal antibodies, phage display, the human antibody mouse, single B cell antibody technology, and affinity maturation. Finally, future applications and perspectives are also discussed."

                            "Monoclonal antibodies are recognised as an important class of drug especially against autoimmune diseases, cancers and infectious diseases (Pansri et al., 2009)(Yamada, 2011). To accommodate the increased interest in biomedical applications of antibodies, antibody phage display technology has provided an alternative for rapid discovery and broad utilisation of novel, highly specific and fully human antibodies (Schirrmann et al., 2011).\n\nSince the introduction of monoclonal antibody technology by Kohler and Milstein in 1975, antibodies have become important biomolecules due to their capability to be applied in various fields, and most importantly in diagnostic, therapeutics, and vaccine development (Nissim et al., 2008). The potential of applications of na\u00efve antibodies isolated from na\u00efve libraries in diagnostics had been demonstrated in few publications. Isolated scFv and Fab antibody fragments against native spores of Bacillus subtilis IFO 3336 were labelled with two different fluorescent dyes (FITC or rhodamine-N-hydroxysuccinimide) for direct and indirect detection by fluorescence microscope. The detection signal was greatly amplified when fluorescent dye was labelled to the highcopy number of phage coat protein pVIII of the antibody phage particles. Direct detection of individual spores was made possible by fluorescent-labelled antibody-phage clones (Zhou et al., 2002). These spore binding antibodies could be further incorporated into other detection systems such as high-flow-rate fluidized bed as solid phase capture (Weimer et al., 2001), electrochemiluminescent immunoassay (ECLIA) (Yu, 1998), and magnetic particle fluorogenic immunoassay (MPFIA) (Yu, 1998).\n\nAnother example was demonstrated by L. acidophilus species specific scFv isolated with phage display technology. The resulting scFvs isolated was applied in FACS for enrichment of L. acidophilus which resulted in more than 99.8% genome coverage. It was envisioned that this species specific antibodies could be applied to enrich low abundance organism in a community which could lead to better taxonomic identification and genome recovery prior to genome sequencing [143]."
