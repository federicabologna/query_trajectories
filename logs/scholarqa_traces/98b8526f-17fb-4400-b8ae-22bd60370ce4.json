However, there are certain challenges associated with small molecules, such as leakage and premature release, which can compromise their effectiveness. Despite these challenges, lipid nanoparticles offer advantages in terms of solubility, stability, and targeted delivery, thereby reducing side effects. Additionally, they can be customized for specific molecules, ensuring biocompatibility and biodegradability. While complications may arise, lipid nanoparticles offer numerous benefits for loading biomolecules, improving pharmacokinetics, and enhancing therapeutic effects. It is important to address stability and loading challenges when encapsulating biomolecules and consider potential immunogenic responses that may impact biocompatibility and safety.\n",

Various attempts are currently being made to improve the in vivo performance of therapeutic molecules by encapsulating them in various nanocarrier systems or devices and administering them via invasive/non-invasive or minimally invasive drug administration methods. Biocompatible and biodegradable lipid nanoparticles have emerged as a potential alternative to conventional ocular drug delivery systems to overcome various ocular barriers. Lipid-based nanocarrier systems led to major technological advancements and therapeutic advantages during the last few decades of ocular therapy, such as high precorneal residence time, sustained drug release profile, minimum dosing frequency, decreased drug toxicity, targeted site delivery, and, therefore, an improvement in ocular bioavailability. In addition, such formulations can be given as fine dispersion in patient-friendly droppable preparation without causing blurred vision and ocular sensitivity reactions. The unique advantages of lipid nanoparticles, namely, solid lipid nanoparticles, nanostructured lipid carriers, nanoemulsions, and liposomes in intraocular targeted administration of various therapeutic drugs are extensively discussed. Ongoing and completed clinical trials of various liposome-based formulations and various characterization techniques designed for nanoemulsion in ocular delivery are tabulated. This review also describes diverse solid lipid nanoparticle preparation methods, procedures, advantages, and limitations. Functionalization approaches to overcome the drawbacks of lipid nanoparticles, as well as the exploration of new functional additives with the potential to improve the penetration of macromolecular pharmaceuticals, would quickly progress the challenging field of ocular drug delivery systems.",

Uniform nanoparticles with about 100 nm in size were obtained using the modified emulsification solvent evaporation method. The results indicated that LPNs showed higher encapsulation efficiency compared with naked polycaprolactone nanoparticles. According to the results of bioactivity assay, 63.86% bioactive lysozyme was recovered from the LPNs. These results indicated that modification of polycaprolactone nanoparticles with lipids could considerably increase the drug-delivery efficiency and LPNs had potential in the delivery of peptides and proteins.",

Traditional diagnosis methods often detect cancer at a considerably critical stage and the conventional methods of treatment like chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy have several limitations, multidrug resistance, cytotoxicity, and lack of specificity are a few examples. These pose substantial challenge for effective and favourable cancer treatment. The advent of nanotechnology has revolutionized the face of cancer diagnosis and treatment. Nanoparticles, which have a size range of 1\u2013100 nm, are biocompatible and have special optical, magnetic, and electrical capabilities, less toxic, more stable, exhibit permeability and retention effect, and are used for precise targeting. There are several classes of nanoparticles each having their own sets of unique properties. NPs have played an important role in the drug delivery system, overcoming the multi-drug resistance, reducing the side-effects as seen in conventional therapeutic methods and hence able to solve the limitations of conventional methods of diagnosis and treatment. This review discusses the four major classes of nanoparticles (Lipid based NPs, Carbon NPs and Metallic NPs and Polymeric NPs): their discovery and introduction in medical field, unique properties and characteristics, advantages and disadvantages, sub-categories and characteristics of these categories, major area of application in Cancer diagnosis and treatment, and latest methodologies where these are used in cancer treatment.",

This biocompatibility minimizes the risk of adverse immune reactions and toxicity, making them ideal for clinical applications. \n\nVersatility in drug delivery: LNPs can encapsulate a wide range of therapeutic agents, including chemotherapeutics, nucleic acids (such as siRNA and mRNA), and proteins. This versatility allows for the targeted delivery of these agents to cancer cells, improving therapeutic outcomes while reducing systemic side effects. \n\nEnhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect: LNPs benefit from the EPR effect, which facilitates their accumulation in tumor tissues due to the leaky vasculature and poor lymphatic drainage of tumours. This property enhances the concentration of therapeutic agents at the tumor site, improving treatment efficacy.",

Traditional diagnosis methods often detect cancer at a considerably critical stage and the conventional methods of treatment like chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy have several limitations, multidrug resistance, cytotoxicity, and lack of specificity are a few examples. These pose substantial challenge for effective and favourable cancer treatment. The advent of nanotechnology has revolutionized the face of cancer diagnosis and treatment. Nanoparticles, which have a size range of 1\u2013100 nm, are biocompatible and have special optical, magnetic, and electrical capabilities, less toxic, more stable, exhibit permeability and retention effect, and are used for precise targeting. There are several classes of nanoparticles each having their own sets of unique properties. NPs have played an important role in the drug delivery system, overcoming the multi-drug resistance, reducing the side-effects as seen in conventional therapeutic methods and hence able to solve the limitations of conventional methods of diagnosis and treatment. This review discusses the four major classes of nanoparticles (Lipid based NPs, Carbon NPs and Metallic NPs and Polymeric NPs): their discovery and introduction in medical field, unique properties and characteristics, advantages and disadvantages, sub-categories and characteristics of these categories, major area of application in Cancer diagnosis and treatment, and latest methodologies where these are used in cancer treatment.\n## Lipid nanoparticles\nBiocompatibility and safety: Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are inherently biocompatible due to their composition, which often mimics natural biological membranes. This biocompatibility minimizes the risk of adverse immune reactions and toxicity, making them ideal for clinical applications. \n\nVersatility in drug delivery: LNPs can encapsulate a wide range of therapeutic agents, including chemotherapeutics, nucleic acids (such as siRNA and mRNA), and proteins. This versatility allows for the targeted delivery of these agents to cancer cells, improving therapeutic outcomes while reducing systemic side effects. \n\nEnhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect: LNPs benefit from the EPR effect, which facilitates their accumulation in tumor tissues due to the leaky vasculature and poor lymphatic drainage of tumours. This property enhances the concentration of therapeutic agents at the tumor site, improving treatment efficacy.",

Furthermore, we present recent findings and underlying mechanisms on how STING pathway activation fosters antitumor immunity and regulates the tumor microenvironment and provide a summary of the distinct STING agonists in preclinical studies and clinical trials.

However, in cancer patients without sufficient antitumor immunity, numerous data indicate that blocking the negative signals elicited by immune checkpoints is ineffective. Drugs that stimulate immune activation\u2010related pathways are emerging as another route for improving immunotherapy. In addition, the development of nanotechnology presents a promising platform for tissue and cell type\u2010specific delivery and improved uptake of immunomodulatory agents, ultimately leading to enhanced cancer immunotherapy and reduced side effects. In this review, we summarize and discuss the latest developments in nanoparticles (NPs) for cancer immuno\u2010oncology therapy with a focus on lipid\u2010based NPs (lipid\u2010NPs), including the characteristics and advantages of various types. Using the agonists targeting stimulation of the interferon genes (STING) transmembrane protein as an exemplar, we review the potential of various lipid\u2010NPs to augment STING agonist therapy. Furthermore, we present recent findings and underlying mechanisms on how STING pathway activation fosters antitumor immunity and regulates the tumor microenvironment and provide a summary of the distinct STING agonists in preclinical studies and clinical trials. Ultimately, we conduct a critical assessment of the obstacles and future directions in the utilization of lipid\u2010NPs to enhance cancer immunotherapy.\n## LIPID-BASED NPs AS DRUG DELIVERY SYSTEM IN CANCER IMMUNOTHERAPY\nLipid-NPs, encompassing liposomes, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), nanoemulsions (NEs), solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs), extracellular vesicles (EVs), and lipid polymer hybrid nanoparticles (LPHNPs), and so on, exhibit significant potential for delivering therapies and other applications in theragnostic, cosmetics, and nutrition. 20 The advantages and disadvantages of various lipid-NPs as drug delivery systems are listed in Table 1. \n\nLipid-NPs possess favorable safety, biocompatibility, degradability, and low toxicity due to their structural characteristics, which resemble those of the plasma membrane of human cells. 20 Additionally, lipid-NPs can serve as a delivery platform to protect encapsulated cargo from degradation and aggregation during circulation, thereby improving the pharmacokinetic attributes and physicochemical stability of immune agents or combined intervention drugs. 5 Furthermore, lipid-NPs are widely held to improve the delivery of cargos to tumors by two ways, namely passive and active targeting thereby enhancing intratumor aggregation and reducing ineffective systemic distribution of encapsulated cargos, ultimately resulting in a reduction of unexpected side effects. 21 Passive targeting is also known as the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, which allows lipid-NPs to leak preferentially into tumors through permeable tumor vessels and to enable efficient retention within the TME due to reduced lymphatic drainage. 22 Active targeting facilitates the uptake of lipid-NPs by specific cell types and other compositions in the TME, promoting the cellular uptake and efficiency of therapeutic agents. 23\n\n## The upgraded version of lipid-NPs: LPHNPs\nThe application of lipid-NPs and polymeric NPs has surfaced as efficacious methodologies to enhance the solubility and stability of anticancer drugs, protract the half-life of anticancer drugs in plasma, diminish off-target distribution, mitigate drug toxicity, and foster drug accumulation in disease regions, thereby augmenting the therapeutic efficacy of the loaded drugs. 219 Nevertheless, both liposomal and polymeric NPs exhibit certain limitations, prompting the development of LPHNPs as a novel class of NPs. 220 PHNPs can be classified into five distinct classes based on their structural composition, including monolithic LPHNPs, polymer core lipid shell NPs, hollow core lipid-polymer-lipid nanoparticles, biomimetic lipid polymer hybrid systems, and polymer caged liposomes. 221 Despite their subtype, LPHNPs offer several advantages, such as enhanced biocompatibility and safety, improved drug loading capacity and controlled release, as well as prolonged circulation time and therapeutic efficacy of drugs. 222 For example, the utilization of CLD-based cores has demonstrated the ability to incorporate anionic drugs and nucleic acids. 223 This approach can be further enhanced by utilizing lipids or biomimetic lipids, such as those derived from stem cells, platelets, and white blood cells, as a coating layer.

            "abstract": "The focus of this research is to design a bioengineered drug delivery vehicle that is efficient in anti-cancer drug delivery in a controlled manner. The experimental work focuses on constructing a methotrexate-loaded nano lipid polymer system (MTX-NLPHS) that can transport methotrexate (MTX) in MCF-7 cell lines in a controlled manner through endocytosis via phosphatidylcholine. In this experiment, MTX is embedded with polylactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) in phosphatidylcholine, which acts as a liposomal framework for regulated drug delivery. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and dynamic light scattering (DLS) were utilized to characterize the developed nanohybrid system. The particle size and encapsulation efficiency of the MTX-NLPHS were found to be 198 \u00b1 8.44 nm and 86.48 \u00b1 0.31 %, respectively, which is suitable for biological applications. The polydispersity index (PDI) and zeta potential of the final system were found to be 0.134 \u00b1 0.048 and -28 \u00b1 3.50 mV, respectively. The lower value of PDI showed the homogenous nature of the particle size, whereas higher negative zeta potential prevented the system from agglomeration. An in vitro release kinetics was conducted to see the release pattern of the system, which took 250 h for 100% drug release This kind of system may carry the drug for a long time in the circulatory system and prevent the drug discharge. Other cell culture assays such as 3-(4, 5-dimethyl thiazolyl-2)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) monitoring were used to see the effect of inducers on the cellular system. MTT assay showed cell toxicity of MTX-NLPHS reduced at the lower concentration of the MTX, however, toxicity increased at the higher concentration of the MTX as compared to free MTX. ROS monitoring c revealed more scavenging of ROS using MTX-NLPHS as compared to free MTX. Confocal microscopy suggested the MTX-NLPHS induced more nuclear elongation with cell shrinkage comparatively.",

                    "text": "The optimum drug conjugated nanosystem is selected based on the drug encapsulation efficiency and biochemical features of the targeted medications chosen for therapy [11]. However, nanocarrier toxicity must be addressed when contemplating the application of nanomedicine [12]. Biodegradable polymeric nanoparticles and liposomes are the two emerging popular categories of drug nanocarriers, as indicated by a growing number of approved drug products, research reports, and cumulative numbers of clinical trials [13]. The two classes have virtues and detriments relating to biological and physiochemical features. In the past, innumerable types of lipids have been used in many drug conveyance methods including solid lipid nanoparticles, liposomes, druglipid complexes, and nanostructured lipid carriers [14,15]. As long as the lipid components of the liposome are obtained from natural sources, they are biodegradable, biocompatible, flexible, mildly toxic or nontoxic, and non-immunogenic for both systemic and non-systemic use [16]. \n\nLiposomal drugs have some disadvantages related to chemical and physical stability, sterilization, batch-to-batch reproducibility, manufacturing scale-up as well as drug entrapment [17]. However, polymeric nanoparticles have merits in terms of a larger variety of preparation methodologies, the ability of tissue penetration, smaller particle size, improved stability in biological fluids, availability of various polymers, release profiles, and versatile drug loading [18]. The use of toxic organic solvents in the manufacturing process, drug leakage before reaching target tissues, poor drug encapsulation for hydrophilic drugs, scale-up issues, polymer cytotoxicity, and polymer degradation are all disadvantages of polymeric nanoparticles [19]. Therefore, in this formulation, we tried to improve the physiochemical and pharmacokinetic parameters of the nanocarriers in terms of size, shape, stability, high drug loading efficiency, shelf-life, and controlled drug release pattern by merging lipids with drug-encapsulated PLGA and selecting optimized formulation parameters.",

The experimental work focuses on constructing a methotrexate-loaded nano lipid polymer system (MTX-NLPHS) that can transport methotrexate (MTX) in MCF-7 cell lines in a controlled manner through endocytosis via phosphatidylcholine. In this experiment, MTX is embedded with polylactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) in phosphatidylcholine, which acts as a liposomal framework for regulated drug delivery. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and dynamic light scattering (DLS) were utilized to characterize the developed nanohybrid system. The particle size and encapsulation efficiency of the MTX-NLPHS were found to be 198 \u00b1 8.44 nm and 86.48 \u00b1 0.31 %, respectively, which is suitable for biological applications. The polydispersity index (PDI) and zeta potential of the final system were found to be 0.134 \u00b1 0.048 and -28 \u00b1 3.50 mV, respectively. The lower value of PDI showed the homogenous nature of the particle size, whereas higher negative zeta potential prevented the system from agglomeration. An in vitro release kinetics was conducted to see the release pattern of the system, which took 250 h for 100% drug release This kind of system may carry the drug for a long time in the circulatory system and prevent the drug discharge. Other cell culture assays such as 3-(4, 5-dimethyl thiazolyl-2)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) monitoring were used to see the effect of inducers on the cellular system. MTT assay showed cell toxicity of MTX-NLPHS reduced at the lower concentration of the MTX, however, toxicity increased at the higher concentration of the MTX as compared to free MTX. ROS monitoring c revealed more scavenging of ROS using MTX-NLPHS as compared to free MTX. Confocal microscopy suggested the MTX-NLPHS induced more nuclear elongation with cell shrinkage comparatively.\n## Ivyspring International Publisher\nThe optimum drug conjugated nanosystem is selected based on the drug encapsulation efficiency and biochemical features of the targeted medications chosen for therapy [11]. However, nanocarrier toxicity must be addressed when contemplating the application of nanomedicine [12]. Biodegradable polymeric nanoparticles and liposomes are the two emerging popular categories of drug nanocarriers, as indicated by a growing number of approved drug products, research reports, and cumulative numbers of clinical trials [13]. The two classes have virtues and detriments relating to biological and physiochemical features. In the past, innumerable types of lipids have been used in many drug conveyance methods including solid lipid nanoparticles, liposomes, druglipid complexes, and nanostructured lipid carriers [14,15]. As long as the lipid components of the liposome are obtained from natural sources, they are biodegradable, biocompatible, flexible, mildly toxic or nontoxic, and non-immunogenic for both systemic and non-systemic use [16]. \n\nLiposomal drugs have some disadvantages related to chemical and physical stability, sterilization, batch-to-batch reproducibility, manufacturing scale-up as well as drug entrapment [17]. However, polymeric nanoparticles have merits in terms of a larger variety of preparation methodologies, the ability of tissue penetration, smaller particle size, improved stability in biological fluids, availability of various polymers, release profiles, and versatile drug loading [18]. The use of toxic organic solvents in the manufacturing process, drug leakage before reaching target tissues, poor drug encapsulation for hydrophilic drugs, scale-up issues, polymer cytotoxicity, and polymer degradation are all disadvantages of polymeric nanoparticles [19]. Therefore, in this formulation, we tried to improve the physiochemical and pharmacokinetic parameters of the nanocarriers in terms of size, shape, stability, high drug loading efficiency, shelf-life, and controlled drug release pattern by merging lipids with drug-encapsulated PLGA and selecting optimized formulation parameters.",

Their biocompatibility, ability to encapsulate a wide range of therapeutic and diagnostic agents, and potential for surface modification make them ideal candidates for targeted and personalized medicine. Continued research in the development and synthesis of chemically modified LNPs to achieve tunable biodegradability in vivo would allow the optimization of delivery vehicles, making them more versatile, highly efficient, and biocompatible. Advances in nanoparticle design have significantly improved their stability, targeting efficiency, and controlled-release properties, addressing some of the major challenges in current medical treatments. It is important to note that, among the various types of lipid nanoparticles, liposomes are currently the only lipid-based carriers for theranostics that are undergoing clinical trials. This highlights their established safety profile and efficacy, setting a milestone for other lipid nanoparticles in the theranostic field. \n\nHowever, despite the promising results, several hurdles remain to be overcome before lipid nanoparticles can be widely adopted in clinical practice. These include their potential toxicity, the scalability of their production, regulatory approval, and the need for more comprehensive in vivo studies to fully understand their long-term effects and efficacy. Furthermore, combining diagnostic and therapeutic functionalities into a single nanoparticle system poses additional challenges in terms of design and functionality. \n\nFor these reasons, the use of LNPs in medicine is expected to expand significantly. The development of different types of LNPs with optimized drug delivery properties, such as nanostructured lipid carriers and ionizable cationic nanoparticles, brings additional advantages to LNP formulations and broadens the perspectives of their applications [139]. \n\nFuture research should focus on the development of more sophisticated nanoparticle systems, improving targeting accuracy, and ensuring safe and cost-effective production methods. Interdisciplinary collaboration among chemists, biologists, engineers, and medical professionals will be crucial to advance this technology from the laboratory to the clinic. \n\nIn conclusion, lipid nanoparticles hold great potential for revolutionizing the field of theranostics by pioneering more efficient and individualized treatment approaches.",

Baldino, Ernesto Reverchon\n## Abstract\nTheranostics is a growing field that matches diagnostics and therapeutics. In this approach, drugs and techniques are uniquely coupled to diagnose and treat medical conditions synergically or sequentially. By integrating diagnostic and treatment functions in a single platform, the aim of theranostics is to improve precision medicine by tailoring treatments based on real-time information. In this context, lipid-based nanocarriers have attracted great scientific attention due to their biodegradability, biocompatibility, and targeting capabilities. The present review highlights the latest research advances in the field of lipid-based nanocarriers for cancer theranostics, exploring several ways of improving in vivo performance and addressing associated challenges. These nanocarriers have significant potential to create new perspectives in the field of nanomedicine and offer promise for a significant step towards more personalized and precise medicine, reducing side effects and improving clinical outcomes for patients. This review also presents the actual barriers to and the possible challenges in the use of nanoparticles in the theranostic field, such as regulatory hurdles, high costs, and technological integration. Addressing these issues through a multidisciplinary and collaborative approach among institutions could be essential for advancing lipid nanocarriers in the theranostic field. Such collaborations can leverage diverse expertise and resources, fostering innovation and overcoming the complex challenges associated with clinical translation. This approach will be crucial for realizing the full potential of lipid-based nanocarriers in precision medicine.\n## Conclusions\nLipid nanocarriers have emerged as versatile and powerful tools in the field of theranostics, offering a unique combination of diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities. Their biocompatibility, ability to encapsulate a wide range of therapeutic and diagnostic agents, and potential for surface modification make them ideal candidates for targeted and personalized medicine. Continued research in the development and synthesis of chemically modified LNPs to achieve tunable biodegradability in vivo would allow the optimization of delivery vehicles, making them more versatile, highly efficient, and biocompatible. Advances in nanoparticle design have significantly improved their stability, targeting efficiency, and controlled-release properties, addressing some of the major challenges in current medical treatments. It is important to note that, among the various types of lipid nanoparticles, liposomes are currently the only lipid-based carriers for theranostics that are undergoing clinical trials. This highlights their established safety profile and efficacy, setting a milestone for other lipid nanoparticles in the theranostic field. \n\nHowever, despite the promising results, several hurdles remain to be overcome before lipid nanoparticles can be widely adopted in clinical practice. These include their potential toxicity, the scalability of their production, regulatory approval, and the need for more comprehensive in vivo studies to fully understand their long-term effects and efficacy. Furthermore, combining diagnostic and therapeutic functionalities into a single nanoparticle system poses additional challenges in terms of design and functionality. \n\nFor these reasons, the use of LNPs in medicine is expected to expand significantly. The development of different types of LNPs with optimized drug delivery properties, such as nanostructured lipid carriers and ionizable cationic nanoparticles, brings additional advantages to LNP formulations and broadens the perspectives of their applications [139]. \n\nFuture research should focus on the development of more sophisticated nanoparticle systems, improving targeting accuracy, and ensuring safe and cost-effective production methods. Interdisciplinary collaboration among chemists, biologists, engineers, and medical professionals will be crucial to advance this technology from the laboratory to the clinic. \n\nIn conclusion, lipid nanoparticles hold great potential for revolutionizing the field of theranostics by pioneering more efficient and individualized treatment approaches.",

            "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases have become a major challenge for public health because of their incurable status. Soft nanotechnology provides potential for slowing down the progression of neurodegenerative disorders by using innovative formulations of neuroprotective antioxidants like curcumin, resveratrol, vitamin E, rosmarinic acid, 7,8-dihydroxyflavone, coenzyme Q10, and fish oil. Curcumin is a natural, liposoluble compound, which is of considerable interest for nanomedicine development in combination therapies. The neuroprotective effects of combination treatments can involve restorative mechanisms against oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, and protein aggregation. Despite the anti-amyloid and anti-tau potential of curcumin and its neurogenesis-stimulating properties, the utilization of this antioxidant as a drug in neuroregenerative therapies has huge limitations due to its poor water solubility, physico-chemical instability, and low oral bioavailability. We highlight the developments of soft lipid- and polymer-based delivery carriers of curcumin, which help improve the drug solubility and stability. We specifically focus on amphiphilic liquid crystalline nanocarriers (cubosome, hexosome, spongosome, and liposome particles) for the encapsulation of curcumin with the purpose of halting the progressive neuronal loss in Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s, and Huntington\u2019s diseases and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).",

                    "text": "The lipids used to prepare biocompatible and biodegradable nanoparticles are usually naturally-occurring molecules with low acute and chronic toxicity. In the case of polymeric nanoparticles, the in vivo degradation of the polymer matrices might cause toxic effects [94]. The biocompatibility and the physico-chemical diversity of lipids and their capacity to enhance the oral bioavailability of drugs have made this kind of nanocarriers very attractive systems for drug delivery. As a matter of fact, lipid-based formulations may positively influence drug absorption in several ways, e.g., by influencing the solubilization properties, preventing the drug precipitation upon intestinal dilution, increasing the membrane permeability, inhibiting the efflux transporters, reducing the CYP enzymes, or enhancing the lymphatic transport [94,122]. \n\nAmong the lipid-based nanoparticles, SLNPs have been intensively developed because they combine the advantages of different carrier systems like liposomes and polymeric particles. Similarly to liposomes, SLNPs are composed of physiologically-biocompatible excipients (lipids and fatty acids). In the same way to polymeric NPs, their solid matrix core can efficiently protect the loaded active pharmaceutical ingredient against chemical degradation under the harsh conditions of biological milieux. Therefore, SLNPs provide controlled release profiles of the encapsulated drugs [95]. \n\nIn addition to the above advantages, liposomes can encapsulate and transport both lipophilic and hydrophilic drugs. They have a high degree of similarity to cell membranes in terms of lipid composition and organization, which facilitates the bioavailability of the pharmaceutical compounds [102]. Liquid crystalline nanocarriers (LCN) such as cubosomes and hexosomes (Figure 3) involve multiple compartments for encapsulation of either lipophilic or hydrophilic drugs. They display structural advantages which enable high encapsulation efficacy for molecules of various sizes and hydrophilicity [113,116].",

Angelova\n## Abstract\nNeurodegenerative diseases have become a major challenge for public health because of their incurable status. Soft nanotechnology provides potential for slowing down the progression of neurodegenerative disorders by using innovative formulations of neuroprotective antioxidants like curcumin, resveratrol, vitamin E, rosmarinic acid, 7,8-dihydroxyflavone, coenzyme Q10, and fish oil. Curcumin is a natural, liposoluble compound, which is of considerable interest for nanomedicine development in combination therapies. The neuroprotective effects of combination treatments can involve restorative mechanisms against oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, and protein aggregation. Despite the anti-amyloid and anti-tau potential of curcumin and its neurogenesis-stimulating properties, the utilization of this antioxidant as a drug in neuroregenerative therapies has huge limitations due to its poor water solubility, physico-chemical instability, and low oral bioavailability. We highlight the developments of soft lipid- and polymer-based delivery carriers of curcumin, which help improve the drug solubility and stability. We specifically focus on amphiphilic liquid crystalline nanocarriers (cubosome, hexosome, spongosome, and liposome particles) for the encapsulation of curcumin with the purpose of halting the progressive neuronal loss in Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s, and Huntington\u2019s diseases and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).\n## Nanocarrier-Mediated Curcumin Delivery\nNanotechnology for nanomedicine development employs functional materials with appropriate nanoscale organization that can interact with biological systems and induce desired physiological responses while minimizing undesirable side effects [60]. Nanotechnology-based delivery systems can influence drug capacity to cross the biological barriers (e.g., the BBB) and reach the targeted brain regions [58][59][60][61]. Therefore, nanocarriers are promising for the development of personalized medicines for the treatment of neurological disorders [62][63][64][65][66][67]. \n\nLipid-based nanoparticles, including solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNPs), nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC), liposomes and liquid crystalline nanocarriers (LCN), as well as polymer-based nanoparticles (Figure 3), have been developed to overcome the poor solubility, stability, and bioavailability of curcumin, and to promote its utilization as a drug in disease treatments . Lipid-based nanoparticles have the advantage of being the least toxic carriers for in vivo applications. The lipids used to prepare biocompatible and biodegradable nanoparticles are usually naturally-occurring molecules with low acute and chronic toxicity. In the case of polymeric nanoparticles, the in vivo degradation of the polymer matrices might cause toxic effects [94]. The biocompatibility and the physico-chemical diversity of lipids and their capacity to enhance the oral bioavailability of drugs have made this kind of nanocarriers very attractive systems for drug delivery. As a matter of fact, lipid-based formulations may positively influence drug absorption in several ways, e.g., by influencing the solubilization properties, preventing the drug precipitation upon intestinal dilution, increasing the membrane permeability, inhibiting the efflux transporters, reducing the CYP enzymes, or enhancing the lymphatic transport [94,122]. \n\nAmong the lipid-based nanoparticles, SLNPs have been intensively developed because they combine the advantages of different carrier systems like liposomes and polymeric particles.\n...\nThe lipids used to prepare biocompatible and biodegradable nanoparticles are usually naturally-occurring molecules with low acute and chronic toxicity.

Similarly to liposomes, SLNPs are composed of physiologically-biocompatible excipients (lipids and fatty acids). In the same way to polymeric NPs, their solid matrix core can efficiently protect the loaded active pharmaceutical ingredient against chemical degradation under the harsh conditions of biological milieux. Therefore, SLNPs provide controlled release profiles of the encapsulated drugs [95]. \n\nIn addition to the above advantages, liposomes can encapsulate and transport both lipophilic and hydrophilic drugs. They have a high degree of similarity to cell membranes in terms of lipid composition and organization, which facilitates the bioavailability of the pharmaceutical compounds [102]. Liquid crystalline nanocarriers (LCN) such as cubosomes and hexosomes (Figure 3) involve multiple compartments for encapsulation of either lipophilic or hydrophilic drugs. They display structural advantages which enable high encapsulation efficacy for molecules of various sizes and hydrophilicity [113,116].",

Drug penetration into and retention within the joints are major challenges in the development of regenerative therapies for OA. During the recent years, polymeric nanoparticles (PNPs) have emerged as promising drug carrier candidates due to their biodegradable properties, nanoscale structure, functional versatility, and reproducible manufacturing, which makes them particularly attractive for cartilage penetration and joint retention. In this review, we discuss the current development state of natural and synthetic PNPs for drug delivery and OA treatment. Evidence from in vitro and pre-clinical in vivo studies is used to show how disease pathology and key cellular pathways of joint inflammation are modulated by these nanoparticle-based therapies. Furthermore, we compare the biodegradability and surface modification of these nanocarriers in relation to the drug release profile and tissue targeting. Finally, the main challenges for nanoparticle delivery to the cartilage are discussed, as a function of disease state and physicochemical properties of PNPs such as size and surface charge.",

Encapsulation of small molecules, biological drugs, and nucleic acids in nanocarriers have shown great potential for OA treatment [37]. The main advantages include: (1) superior drug targeting and bioavailability; (2) reduced toxicity and adverse effects; (3) higher drug solubility and stability; (4) prolonged retention time in the cartilage; (5) increased drug efficacy [38][39][40]. \n\nLipid based nanoparticles (LNPs) and liposomes were the first nanocarriers approved by FDA and have many therapeutic applications, such as the current COVID-19 mRNA-LNPs vaccines [41]. They are considered as ideal drug delivery systems due to their excellent biocompatibility and low toxicity, as well as for encapsulating both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drug cargos [42,43]. Despite these promising features, rapid clearance from synovial fluid remains an issue for OA therapy [14]. Other nanocarriers also show important limitations: exosomes display manufacturing challenges [44] and inorganic NPs lack deeper toxicological assessment in literature [45]. Finally, the clinical application of micelles and dendrimers is still hampered by the non-encapsulation of hydrophilic drugs and toxicity concerns [39]. In this review, we focus on another class of delivery vehicles-the polymeric nanoparticles (PNPs). \n\nPolymeric nanoparticles are solid particles that can incorporate hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs, such as small molecules, proteins, and nucleic acids. They are extensively used in the field of nanomedicine due to their structural versatility, facile synthesis, and higher stability when compared to other nanoparticle types.",

Creemers\n## Abstract\nOsteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative musculoskeletal disorder affecting the whole synovial joint and globally impacts more than one in five individuals aged 40 and over, representing a huge socioeconomic burden. Drug penetration into and retention within the joints are major challenges in the development of regenerative therapies for OA. During the recent years, polymeric nanoparticles (PNPs) have emerged as promising drug carrier candidates due to their biodegradable properties, nanoscale structure, functional versatility, and reproducible manufacturing, which makes them particularly attractive for cartilage penetration and joint retention. In this review, we discuss the current development state of natural and synthetic PNPs for drug delivery and OA treatment. Evidence from in vitro and pre-clinical in vivo studies is used to show how disease pathology and key cellular pathways of joint inflammation are modulated by these nanoparticle-based therapies. Furthermore, we compare the biodegradability and surface modification of these nanocarriers in relation to the drug release profile and tissue targeting. Finally, the main challenges for nanoparticle delivery to the cartilage are discussed, as a function of disease state and physicochemical properties of PNPs such as size and surface charge.\n## Nanoscale-Delivery Systems and Polymeric Nanoparticles\nNanocarriers used as drug delivery systems include liposomes, exosomes, micelles, dendrimers, inorganic NPs, and polymeric nanoparticles (PNPs). Encapsulation of small molecules, biological drugs, and nucleic acids in nanocarriers have shown great potential for OA treatment [37]. The main advantages include: (1) superior drug targeting and bioavailability; (2) reduced toxicity and adverse effects; (3) higher drug solubility and stability; (4) prolonged retention time in the cartilage; (5) increased drug efficacy [38][39][40]. \n\nLipid based nanoparticles (LNPs) and liposomes were the first nanocarriers approved by FDA and have many therapeutic applications, such as the current COVID-19 mRNA-LNPs vaccines [41]. They are considered as ideal drug delivery systems due to their excellent biocompatibility and low toxicity, as well as for encapsulating both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drug cargos [42,43]. Despite these promising features, rapid clearance from synovial fluid remains an issue for OA therapy [14]. Other nanocarriers also show important limitations: exosomes display manufacturing challenges [44] and inorganic NPs lack deeper toxicological assessment in literature [45]. Finally, the clinical application of micelles and dendrimers is still hampered by the non-encapsulation of hydrophilic drugs and toxicity concerns [39]. In this review, we focus on another class of delivery vehicles-the polymeric nanoparticles (PNPs). \n\nPolymeric nanoparticles are solid particles that can incorporate hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs, such as small molecules, proteins, and nucleic acids. They are extensively used in the field of nanomedicine due to their structural versatility, facile synthesis, and higher stability when compared to other nanoparticle types.",

This review highlights the potential of siRNA to selectively silence genes that are overexpressed or uniquely expressed in cancer cells, thereby disrupting critical pathways that support tumor growth and survival. Key target genes discussed include survivin, VEGF, EGFR, c-MET, HER2, MUC1, and Bcl-2, all of which play vital roles in tumor proliferation, angiogenesis, and resistance to therapies. Clinical trials investigating various siRNA candidates, such as EZN-3042 and ALN-VSP, indicate that these therapies are generally well-tolerated; however, significant challenges persist, including the effective delivery and stability of siRNA. Recent advancements in nanoparticle-based delivery systems have shown promise in addressing these issues. Future research will focus on optimizing siRNA delivery methods, personalizing therapies based on individual genetic profiles, and establishing clearer regulatory guidelines for approval.

Advances in cell and animal models provide insights into the underlining pathogenesis, which facilitates the development and maturation of new treatment strategies. The progress in biochemistry and molecular biology has established a new class of therapeutics\u2014the short RNAs and expressible long RNAs. The sequences of therapeutic RNAs can be optimized to enhance their stability and translatability with reduced immunogenicity. The chemically-modified RNAs can also increase their stability during intracellular trafficking. In addition, the development of safe and high efficiency carriers that preserves the integrity of therapeutic RNA molecules also accelerates the transition of RNA therapeutics into the clinic. For example, for diseases that are caused by genetic defects in a specific protein, an effective approach termed \u201cprotein replacement therapy\u201d can provide treatment through the delivery of modified translatable mRNAs. Short interference RNAs can also be used to treat diseases caused by gain of function mutations or restore the splicing aberration defects. Here we review the applications of newly developed RNA-based therapeutics and its delivery and discuss the clinical evidence supporting the potential of RNA-based therapy in single-gene neurological disorders.",

Nanocarriers for drug delivery may provide a more favorable halflife, a better-controlled release, and a precise localization [60][61][62]. Based on the material that is used, there are three categories of nanocarriers: organic-based, inorganic-based, or a combination of both. The organic nanocarriers include polymeric frameworks and lipid-based systems. Drug conjugates and micelles belong to the polymeric framework, while liposomes, nanoemulsions, and dendrimers are lipid-based systems. The metallic structures, silica nanoparticles, and quantum dots consist of inorganic nanocarriers [63]. Among the nanocarriers, the lipid-based nanoparticle is the leader in terms of higher levels of biocompatibility and flexibility. The potential advantages and short-comings of the lipid-based nanocarriers have been listed in Table 1. The lipid nanoparticles (e.g., solid lipid nanoparticles, SLC) are the pioneer of this rapidly evolving field. There is a long list of attributes and advantages of lipid-based drug delivery systems such as controlled and targeted drug release, pharmaceutical stability, capability for incorporation of both lipophilic and hydrophilic drugs, biodegradability and biocompatibility, low-risk profile, better drug absorption, and lowering the therapeutic dose, etc. The structural modifications of lipid-based nanoparticles enable the delivery carrier to safely and effectively pass through the BBB [64]. Vehicle-based, emulsion-based, or particulate systems are the main lipid nanoparticle drug delivery tools in clinical use [63]. Lipid nanoparticles can satisfy different requirements based on the disease condition, route of administration, product stability, toxicity, and bioavailability. In addition, lipid nanoparticles also have the potential to achieve the goal of controlled and site-specific drug delivery.",

Lee, Kai Wang\n## Abstract\nThe development of new sequencing technologies in the post-genomic era has accelerated the identification of causative mutations of several single gene disorders. Advances in cell and animal models provide insights into the underlining pathogenesis, which facilitates the development and maturation of new treatment strategies. The progress in biochemistry and molecular biology has established a new class of therapeutics\u2014the short RNAs and expressible long RNAs. The sequences of therapeutic RNAs can be optimized to enhance their stability and translatability with reduced immunogenicity. The chemically-modified RNAs can also increase their stability during intracellular trafficking. In addition, the development of safe and high efficiency carriers that preserves the integrity of therapeutic RNA molecules also accelerates the transition of RNA therapeutics into the clinic. For example, for diseases that are caused by genetic defects in a specific protein, an effective approach termed \u201cprotein replacement therapy\u201d can provide treatment through the delivery of modified translatable mRNAs. Short interference RNAs can also be used to treat diseases caused by gain of function mutations or restore the splicing aberration defects. Here we review the applications of newly developed RNA-based therapeutics and its delivery and discuss the clinical evidence supporting the potential of RNA-based therapy in single-gene neurological disorders.\n## Lipid-Based Nanocarriers\nThe growing field of nanoscale delivery systems for therapeutics is the main focus of basic research [59]. Nanocarriers for drug delivery may provide a more favorable halflife, a better-controlled release, and a precise localization [60][61][62]. Based on the material that is used, there are three categories of nanocarriers: organic-based, inorganic-based, or a combination of both. The organic nanocarriers include polymeric frameworks and lipid-based systems. Drug conjugates and micelles belong to the polymeric framework, while liposomes, nanoemulsions, and dendrimers are lipid-based systems. The metallic structures, silica nanoparticles, and quantum dots consist of inorganic nanocarriers [63]. Among the nanocarriers, the lipid-based nanoparticle is the leader in terms of higher levels of biocompatibility and flexibility. The potential advantages and short-comings of the lipid-based nanocarriers have been listed in Table 1. The lipid nanoparticles (e.g., solid lipid nanoparticles, SLC) are the pioneer of this rapidly evolving field. There is a long list of attributes and advantages of lipid-based drug delivery systems such as controlled and targeted drug release, pharmaceutical stability, capability for incorporation of both lipophilic and hydrophilic drugs, biodegradability and biocompatibility, low-risk profile, better drug absorption, and lowering the therapeutic dose, etc. The structural modifications of lipid-based nanoparticles enable the delivery carrier to safely and effectively pass through the BBB [64]. Vehicle-based, emulsion-based, or particulate systems are the main lipid nanoparticle drug delivery tools in clinical use [63]. Lipid nanoparticles can satisfy different requirements based on the disease condition, route of administration, product stability, toxicity, and bioavailability. In addition, lipid nanoparticles also have the potential to achieve the goal of controlled and site-specific drug delivery.",

Graphical Abstract\n## Inorganic\nTherefore, while leveraging the unique advantages of inorganic nanoparticles, it is imperative to balance these with their potential negative issues, such as toxicity.\n\nLipid nanoparticles Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are nanoparticles composed of lipids with a homogeneous lipid core, which are scaled at the nanoscale (typically between tens and hundreds of nanometers), significantly smaller than human cells (~ 7 \u03bcm), can effectively cross cell membranes and other biological barriers, and are capable of encapsulating a variety of drugs, including small-molecule drugs, proteins, and RNA.It also prevents enzymatic degradation of drugs and also reduces adverse drug reactions [114,115].By modifying their surface properties [116][117][118], LNPs can be designed to target specific tissues or cell types, thereby improving therapeutic relevance and efficiency.They are mainly used as controlled-and sustained-release drug carriers [119,120], gene therapy [121,122], artificial tissue and organ construction [123], vaccine development [124], and anticancer drug delivery [125], and have the advantages of good biocompatibility and biodegradability, high encapsulation efficiency, long circulation time, nontoxicity or relatively low toxicity, and slow clearance by body immune cells [126,127].\n\nBionic nanoparticles Bionic nanoparticles are meticulously crafted through the emulation of natural processes or structures inherent in living organisms.Encircled by a biomimetic encapsulating layer reminiscent of a cell membrane, these nanoparticles acquire enhanced biocompatibility and prolonged retention time within the bloodstream [128,129].This characteristic extends their efficacy within the organism, concurrently evading immune system clearance and proteolysis.\n\nThe adjustment of size, shape, and surface charge bestows upon these nanoparticles the capacity to replicate cellular and viral functions.They serve as inducers, attracting and neutralizing toxins, thereby mitigating damage to healthy cells.Moreover, these nanoparticles exhibit the capability to mimic specific biomolecular functions, such as molecular recognition specificity and targeted properties against cancer [130,131].",

Current treatments are often insufficient, prompting the exploration of novel therapeutic agents and delivery mechanisms. This study addresses this gap by investigating the roles of L-arginine (identified as a target drug candidate through network pharmacology) in diabetes management, while also evaluating lipid nanocarriers synthesized from fenugreek seed oil for improved drug delivery. Our docking analyses revealed L-arginine\u2019s strong interactions with diabetes-target genes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and NFKB), with multiple hydrogen bonds and binding energies ranging from \u2212\u20097.2 to \u2212 8.9 kcal/mol. Encapsulated L-arginine lipid nanoparticles were characterized using UV-Visible spectroscopy, showing absorbance peaks at 415 nm for simple nanoparticles and 521 nm for L-arginine-loaded nanoparticles. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed an average nanoparticle size of 100.2 nm, and zeta potential analysis indicated a neutral surface charge (\u2212 9.37 mV). Antioxidative activity showed 84.44% inhibition with an IC50 value of 40.5 \u00b5g/mL The nanoparticles inhibited albumin denaturation by 81.10% and alpha-amylase by 89.30%, surpassing metformin (78.43% at 1000 \u00b5g/mL). Hemolysis percentage was minimal at 10.54%. These findings demonstrate the potential of L-arginine as an anti-diabetic agent and highlight the efficacy of lipid nanocarriers as innovative drug delivery systems, providing a foundation for advancing therapeutic interventions against diabetes.",

This improvement in oral absorption can play a pivotal role in enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of such drugs. \n\nWhile our study highlights the potential of L-arginine-based nanoparticles, the absence of in vivo validation remains a limitation. Future studies should involve animal models to validate these findings and assess pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, and long-term safety. Additionally, clinical trials will be essential to evaluate efficacy and tolerability in human subjects. The synthesis and application of nanoparticles raise significant environmental and ethical concerns. Our study incorporated green chemistry principles by adopting ecofriendly solvents and minimizing waste during nanoparticle synthesis, aiming to reduce the environmental footprint. \n\nAlthough this is a step towards sustainable practices, the potential systemic effects and long-term toxicity of nanoparticles composed of different excipients warrant further exploration. Nanoparticles, depending on their composition, may exhibit varying degrees of biocompatibility or adverse systemic effects, including inflammation, oxidative stress, and cytotoxicity 57 . For instance, lipid-based nanoparticles, are generally considered biocompatible. The unique properties of lipids, such as biodegradability and biocompatibility, add to drug bioavailability through their specialized transport pathways. Hence, lipid-based particles improve gastrointestinal absorption and solubilization of poorly bioavailable drugs by facilitating selective lymphatic transport. Still, they may trigger immune responses or accumulate in the liver and spleen, leading to potential organ toxicity 59 . Studies 60,61 have reported that cationic lipid nanoparticles can be cytotoxic due to their interaction with cell membranes. However, neutral or anionic formulations, such as those used in our study, have demonstrated relatively safer profiles. \n\nTo address these concerns, future studies should evaluate the safety profiles of L-arginine encapsulated lipid nanoparticles through comprehensive in vitro and in vivo toxicological assessments. Such evaluations should include biodistribution studies to understand the fate of nanoparticles within biological systems and their potential accumulation in vital organs.",

Naveed, Bilal Haider Abbasi, Tariq Aziz, Fatma Alshehri, Fahad Al\u2010Asmari, Fakhria A. Al-Joufi, Maher S. Alwethaynani\n## Abstract\nDiabetes, affecting over 10.5% of the global population, leads to severe health complications and economic burdens, highlighting the urgent need for effective therapeutic approaches. Current treatments are often insufficient, prompting the exploration of novel therapeutic agents and delivery mechanisms. This study addresses this gap by investigating the roles of L-arginine (identified as a target drug candidate through network pharmacology) in diabetes management, while also evaluating lipid nanocarriers synthesized from fenugreek seed oil for improved drug delivery. Our docking analyses revealed L-arginine\u2019s strong interactions with diabetes-target genes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and NFKB), with multiple hydrogen bonds and binding energies ranging from \u2212\u20097.2 to \u2212 8.9 kcal/mol. Encapsulated L-arginine lipid nanoparticles were characterized using UV-Visible spectroscopy, showing absorbance peaks at 415 nm for simple nanoparticles and 521 nm for L-arginine-loaded nanoparticles. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed an average nanoparticle size of 100.2 nm, and zeta potential analysis indicated a neutral surface charge (\u2212 9.37 mV). Antioxidative activity showed 84.44% inhibition with an IC50 value of 40.5 \u00b5g/mL The nanoparticles inhibited albumin denaturation by 81.10% and alpha-amylase by 89.30%, surpassing metformin (78.43% at 1000 \u00b5g/mL). Hemolysis percentage was minimal at 10.54%. These findings demonstrate the potential of L-arginine as an anti-diabetic agent and highlight the efficacy of lipid nanocarriers as innovative drug delivery systems, providing a foundation for advancing therapeutic interventions against diabetes.\n## Discussion\nSignificantly, the amorphous structure promotes increased surface area and reduced diffusion distances, enabling more efficient dissolution in biological fluids 56 . This improvement in oral absorption can play a pivotal role in enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of such drugs. \n\nWhile our study highlights the potential of L-arginine-based nanoparticles, the absence of in vivo validation remains a limitation. Future studies should involve animal models to validate these findings and assess pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, and long-term safety. Additionally, clinical trials will be essential to evaluate efficacy and tolerability in human subjects. The synthesis and application of nanoparticles raise significant environmental and ethical concerns. Our study incorporated green chemistry principles by adopting ecofriendly solvents and minimizing waste during nanoparticle synthesis, aiming to reduce the environmental footprint. \n\nAlthough this is a step towards sustainable practices, the potential systemic effects and long-term toxicity of nanoparticles composed of different excipients warrant further exploration. Nanoparticles, depending on their composition, may exhibit varying degrees of biocompatibility or adverse systemic effects, including inflammation, oxidative stress, and cytotoxicity 57 . For instance, lipid-based nanoparticles, are generally considered biocompatible. The unique properties of lipids, such as biodegradability and biocompatibility, add to drug bioavailability through their specialized transport pathways. Hence, lipid-based particles improve gastrointestinal absorption and solubilization of poorly bioavailable drugs by facilitating selective lymphatic transport. Still, they may trigger immune responses or accumulate in the liver and spleen, leading to potential organ toxicity 59 . Studies 60,61 have reported that cationic lipid nanoparticles can be cytotoxic due to their interaction with cell membranes. However, neutral or anionic formulations, such as those used in our study, have demonstrated relatively safer profiles. \n\nTo address these concerns, future studies should evaluate the safety profiles of L-arginine encapsulated lipid nanoparticles through comprehensive in vitro and in vivo toxicological assessments. Such evaluations should include biodistribution studies to understand the fate of nanoparticles within biological systems and their potential accumulation in vital organs.",

Nanomedicine continues to receive increasing interest for the rationalized delivery of therapeutics and pharmaceutical agents to achieve the required response while reducing its side effects. However, as nanotechnology continues to advance, concerns about its potential toxicological effects have also grown. This review explores the current state of nanomedicine, focusing on the types of nanoparticles used and their associated properties that contribute to nanotoxicity. It examines the mechanisms through which nanoparticles exert toxicity, encompassing various cellular and molecular interactions. Furthermore, it discusses the assessment methods employed to evaluate nanotoxicity, encompassing in-vitro and in-vivo models, as well as emerging techniques. The review also addresses the regulatory issues surrounding nanotoxicology, highlighting the challenges in developing standardized guidelines and ensuring the secure translation of nanomedicine into clinical settings. It also explores into the challenges and ethical issues associated with nanotoxicology, as understanding the safety profile of nanoparticles is essential for their effective translation into therapeutic applications.",

These benefits include the ability to transport substantial payloads, biocompatibility, excellent bioavailability, and the simplicity of formulation [40]. As a result, lipid-based NPs have emerged as the predominant class of FDA-approved nanomedicines, owing to their versatility and efficacy [41]. Among the various subsets of lipid-based nanocarriers, liposomes are particularly prominent. Liposomes are typically composed of phospholipids, enabling the formation of unilamellar or multilamellar vesicular structures. This unique property of liposomes enables them to efficiently carry and deliver a wide range of drugs, including hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds. Different things can affect how stable liposomes are, both in the lab and in living things. These include the size of the nanoparticles, their surface charge, the type of lipids they contain, the number of lamellae they have, and any changes to their surface that involve ligands or polymers [42,43]. To stop the reticuloendothelial system from taking them up quickly, liposomes are often modified on the outside to make them last longer in the bloodstream and carry drugs better. These modifications have played a crucial role in facilitating the clinical utilization of liposomes. The nanodispersions made up of uniformly dispersed nanoparticles in a liquid media, with sizes ranging from 1 to 100 nm. Moreover, the surface area increases with decrease in particle size, which improves the rate of breakdown and absorption of the dispersed materials. In pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and culinary goods, these dispersions are frequently employed to increase the solubility, stability, and bioavailability of active substances [44]. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a notable subgroup within lipid-based NPs that are extensively employed for nucleic acid delivery, offering improved stability, protection, and targeted delivery capabilities.",

Ghorpade, Amit Kumar, Akhilesh Patel, Manisha Singh, Nagma Banjare, Prem N. Gupta\n## Abstract\nNanomedicine has the potential to transform healthcare by offering targeted therapies, precise diagnostics, and enhanced drug delivery systems. The National Institutes of Health has coined the term \"nanomedicine\" to describe the use of nanotechnology in biological system monitoring, control, diagnosis, and treatment. Nanomedicine continues to receive increasing interest for the rationalized delivery of therapeutics and pharmaceutical agents to achieve the required response while reducing its side effects. However, as nanotechnology continues to advance, concerns about its potential toxicological effects have also grown. This review explores the current state of nanomedicine, focusing on the types of nanoparticles used and their associated properties that contribute to nanotoxicity. It examines the mechanisms through which nanoparticles exert toxicity, encompassing various cellular and molecular interactions. Furthermore, it discusses the assessment methods employed to evaluate nanotoxicity, encompassing in-vitro and in-vivo models, as well as emerging techniques. The review also addresses the regulatory issues surrounding nanotoxicology, highlighting the challenges in developing standardized guidelines and ensuring the secure translation of nanomedicine into clinical settings. It also explores into the challenges and ethical issues associated with nanotoxicology, as understanding the safety profile of nanoparticles is essential for their effective translation into therapeutic applications.\n## Lipid-based nanoparticles\nLipid-based nanoparticles, which are typically spherical in shape and contain a lipid bilayer that encapsulates aqueous compartments, provide several benefits as a drug delivery system. These benefits include the ability to transport substantial payloads, biocompatibility, excellent bioavailability, and the simplicity of formulation [40]. As a result, lipid-based NPs have emerged as the predominant class of FDA-approved nanomedicines, owing to their versatility and efficacy [41]. Among the various subsets of lipid-based nanocarriers, liposomes are particularly prominent. Liposomes are typically composed of phospholipids, enabling the formation of unilamellar or multilamellar vesicular structures. This unique property of liposomes enables them to efficiently carry and deliver a wide range of drugs, including hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds. Different things can affect how stable liposomes are, both in the lab and in living things. These include the size of the nanoparticles, their surface charge, the type of lipids they contain, the number of lamellae they have, and any changes to their surface that involve ligands or polymers [42,43]. To stop the reticuloendothelial system from taking them up quickly, liposomes are often modified on the outside to make them last longer in the bloodstream and carry drugs better. These modifications have played a crucial role in facilitating the clinical utilization of liposomes. The nanodispersions made up of uniformly dispersed nanoparticles in a liquid media, with sizes ranging from 1 to 100 nm. Moreover, the surface area increases with decrease in particle size, which improves the rate of breakdown and absorption of the dispersed materials. In pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and culinary goods, these dispersions are frequently employed to increase the solubility, stability, and bioavailability of active substances [44]. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a notable subgroup within lipid-based NPs that are extensively employed for nucleic acid delivery, offering improved stability, protection, and targeted delivery capabilities.",

AMPs are small cationic peptides with broad-spectrum antibiotic activities and different action mechanisms to those of traditional antibiotics. Despite the desirable advantages of developing peptide-based antimicrobial agents, the clinical applications of AMPs are still limited because of their enzymatic degradation, toxicity, and selectivity. In this review, structural modifications, such as amino acid substitution, stapling, cyclization of peptides, and hybrid AMPs with conventional antibiotics or other peptides, will be presented. Additionally, nanodelivery systems using metals or lipids to deliver AMPs will be discussed based on the structural properties and action mechanisms of AMPs.\n## Lipid-Based Nanoparticles\nLipid-based nanoparticles (LNPs) have served as delivery systems for AMPs due to their several favorable characteristics, such as physical and chemical stability, biocompatibility, and low cytotoxicity to normal cells [5,69,77]. Liposomes are the most well-known and most widely applied nanocarriers for drug delivery and clinical applications. A study by Cantor et al. proved that the antibacterial activity of a peptide encapsulated into nanoliposomes was increased by approximately 2000-fold against Listeria monocytogenes [78]. Nanosized liposomal formulations of LL-37 and indolicidin showed less toxicity and improved activity [79]. In addition to liposomes, LNP systems for AMPs include micelles, dendrimers, polymeric nanoparticles, and microspheres [69].",

Next, pharmacokinetic aspects are described, such as routes of administration, absorption after oral administration, distribution in the organism (including brain penetration) and elimination processes. Safety and toxicity issues are also addressed. Our work presents an original point of view, addressing the biopharmaceutical aspects of these nanovehicles by means of descriptive statistics of the state-of-the-art of solid lipid nanoparticles research. All the presented results, trends, graphs and discussions are based in a systematic (and reproducible) bibliographic search that considered only original papers in the subject, covering a 7 years range (2013-today), a period that accounts for more than 60% of the total number of publications in the topic in the main bibliographic databases and search engines. Focus was placed on the therapeutic fields of application, absorption and distribution processes and current efforts for the translation into the clinical practice of lipid-based nanoparticles. For this, the currently active clinical trials on lipid nanoparticles were reviewed, with a brief discussion on what achievements or milestones are still to be reached, as a way of understanding the reasons for the scarce number of solid lipid nanoparticles undergoing clinical trials.",

Scioli Montoto, G. Muraca, M. E. Ruiz\n## Abstract\nIn the golden age of pharmaceutical nanocarriers, we are witnessing a maturation stage of the original concepts and ideas. There is no doubt that nanoformulations are extremely valuable tools for drug delivery applications; the current challenge is how to optimize them to ensure that they are safe, effective and scalable, so that they can be manufactured at an industrial level and advance to clinical use. In this context, lipid nanoparticles have gained ground, since they are generally regarded as non-toxic, biocompatible and easy-to-produce formulations. Pharmaceutical applications of lipid nanocarriers are a burgeoning field for the transport and delivery of a diversity of therapeutic agents, from biotechnological products to small drug molecules. This review starts with a brief overview of the characteristics of solid lipid nanoparticles and discusses the relevancy of performing systematic preformulation studies. The main applications, as well as the advantages that this type of nanovehicles offers in certain therapeutic scenarios are discussed. Next, pharmacokinetic aspects are described, such as routes of administration, absorption after oral administration, distribution in the organism (including brain penetration) and elimination processes. Safety and toxicity issues are also addressed. Our work presents an original point of view, addressing the biopharmaceutical aspects of these nanovehicles by means of descriptive statistics of the state-of-the-art of solid lipid nanoparticles research. All the presented results, trends, graphs and discussions are based in a systematic (and reproducible) bibliographic search that considered only original papers in the subject, covering a 7 years range (2013-today), a period that accounts for more than 60% of the total number of publications in the topic in the main bibliographic databases and search engines. Focus was placed on the therapeutic fields of application, absorption and distribution processes and current efforts for the translation into the clinical practice of lipid-based nanoparticles. For this, the currently active clinical trials on lipid nanoparticles were reviewed, with a brief discussion on what achievements or milestones are still to be reached, as a way of understanding the reasons for the scarce number of solid lipid nanoparticles undergoing clinical trials.\n## body\nIn the golden age of pharmaceutical nanocarriers, we are witnessing a maturation stage of the original concepts and ideas.

LNPs have significantly advanced targeted therapy by improving the precision and reducing the systemic toxicity of chemotherapeutics such as doxorubicin and paclitaxel. This manuscript details the design and benefits of various LNP systems, including solid lipid\u2013polymer hybrids, which offer controlled release and enhanced drug encapsulation. Despite achievements in reducing tumor size and enhancing survival, challenges such as manufacturing complexity, biocompatibility, and variable clinical outcomes persist. Future directions are aimed at refining targeting capabilities, expanding combinatorial therapies, and integrating advanced manufacturing techniques to tailor treatments to individual patient profiles, thus promising to transform lung cancer therapy through interdisciplinary collaboration and regulatory innovation.",

Gill, Luigi X Cubeddu\n## Abstract\nThis manuscript explores the use of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) in addressing the pivotal challenges of lung cancer treatment, including drug delivery inefficacy and multi-drug resistance. LNPs have significantly advanced targeted therapy by improving the precision and reducing the systemic toxicity of chemotherapeutics such as doxorubicin and paclitaxel. This manuscript details the design and benefits of various LNP systems, including solid lipid\u2013polymer hybrids, which offer controlled release and enhanced drug encapsulation. Despite achievements in reducing tumor size and enhancing survival, challenges such as manufacturing complexity, biocompatibility, and variable clinical outcomes persist. Future directions are aimed at refining targeting capabilities, expanding combinatorial therapies, and integrating advanced manufacturing techniques to tailor treatments to individual patient profiles, thus promising to transform lung cancer therapy through interdisciplinary collaboration and regulatory innovation.\n## Lipid-Based Nanoparticles\nLipid nanoparticles, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), and lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles (LPHNPs) represent innovative platforms in the field of drug delivery, offering unique advantages and applications in biomedicine.Lipid nanoparticles are highly regarded for their ability to control the release of therapeutic molecules, particularly those that are hydrophobic and have low bioavailability.SLNs and nanostructured lipid carriers are praised for their low toxicity, enhanced encapsulation capacity, controlled drug release kinetics, and scalability, making them pivotal in drug delivery systems [10].\n\nSolid lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles (SLPNs) have emerged as a novel category, combining the beneficial properties of lipids with the stability and functional versatility of polymers.This fusion results in nanocarriers with a controlled particle size, high drug loading yield, and sustained drug release capabilities.Moreover, the hybrid structure of lipid-polymer nanoparticles improved in vitro and in vivo stability, signifying their potential as robust drug carriers [11].\n\nThe lipid-based nanocarriers are gaining significant interest by researchers working on the development of novel formulations for the pulmonary delivery of anticancer drugs owing to their biocompatible, biodegradable, non-toxic, and non-irritant nature, the ability to entrap and deliver diverse molecules in a controlled manner with enhanced bioavailability, the ability to transport across blood vessels and different membranes and barriers, in addition to the ease of preparation and scale-up.Each type of lipid-based carrier has a unique structure, as shown in Figure 1 [12].\n\nPharmaceutics 2024, 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 31\n\nIn summary, the continuous evolution of drug delivery technologies, particularly through LNPs, is essential in addressing the numerous challenges in lung cancer treatment.These technologies promise to enhance the precision, efficacy, and safety of cancer therapeutics, directly responding to the unmet needs and gaps in current treatment modalities.\n...\nLipid nanoparticles, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), and lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles (LPHNPs) represent innovative platforms in the field of drug delivery, offering unique advantages and applications in biomedicine.Lipid nanoparticles are highly regarded for their ability to control the release of therapeutic molecules, particularly those that are hydrophobic and have low bioavailability.SLNs and nanostructured lipid carriers are praised for their low toxicity, enhanced encapsulation capacity, controlled drug release kinetics, and scalability, making them pivotal in drug delivery systems [10].\n\nSolid lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles (SLPNs) have emerged as a novel category, combining the beneficial properties of lipids with the stability and functional versatility of polymers.This fusion results in nanocarriers with a controlled particle size, high drug loading yield, and sustained drug release capabilities.Moreover, the hybrid structure of lipid-polymer nanoparticles improved in vitro and in vivo stability, signifying their potential as robust drug carriers [11].\n\nThe lipid-based nanocarriers are gaining significant interest by researchers working on the development of novel formulations for the pulmonary delivery of anticancer drugs owing to their biocompatible, biodegradable, non-toxic, and non-irritant nature, the ability to entrap and deliver diverse molecules in a controlled manner with enhanced bioavailability, the ability to transport across blood vessels and different membranes and barriers, in addition to the ease of preparation and scale-up.Each type of lipid-based carrier has a unique structure, as shown in Figure 1 [12].Together, lipid-based nanoparticles, especially the advanced solid lipid-polymer hybrid types, hold significant promise for transforming drug delivery, offering targeted, controlled, and efficient therapeutic molecule transport.The continuous research and Pharmaceutics 2024, 16, 644 3 of 30 development in this area are likely to further refine these systems, overcoming current limitations and paving the way for their widespread application in treating complex diseases like cancer [13].\n\nOn the other hand, there are challenges and drawbacks associated with these nanocarriers.",

The innovative NDDS lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles (LPHNPs) combine the attributes of polymeric and lipid nanoparticles (PNPs) (46,(87)(88)(89). Lipophilic and poorly water-soluble drugs can be incorporated in the hydrophobic core of the polymer. They are prepared by two methods: (1) two-step (conventional and non-conventional) and (2) one-step (by nano-precipitation and emulsification-solvent-evaporation) (89,90). LPHNPs offer a versatile drug-delivery system with better drug entrapment, controlled and sustained drug release, great in vitro and in vivo stability (89). In addition, the lipid layer slows down the rate of polymer degradation of LPHNP products by limiting inward water diffusion and helps the sustained-release kinetics of loaded content (89). The properties of LPHNPs advocate for their utility and prove advantageous over existing delivery vehicles (87,91). Thus, well-designed LPHNPs contain hydrophobic polymeric core functions, whereas the surrounding lipid coat is a biocompatible shield and a barrier preventing the fast leakage of water-soluble drugs (92,93). Properties such as biocompatibility, biodegradability, sustained drug-release profiles, and greater loading capacity are attributed to a stable, high-payload, targeted drug-delivery system that might maximize chemotherapeutic efficacy against targeted cancer cells (90, 94). Recently, selfassembled polymer-lipid hybrid NPs were developed aiming at overcoming the limitations seen with conventional drug-delivery systems. The polymer-lipid hybrid NPs gained significant attention for drug and gene delivery (95,96).",

Sha, F. Gao, Hong Liu\n## Abstract\nMethotrexate (MTX) is widely used as an anticancer and anti-inflammtory drug for treating various types of cancer and autoimmune diseases. The optimal dose of MTX is known to inhibit the dihydrofolatereductase that hinders the replication of purines. The nanobiomedicine has been extensively explored in the past decade to develop myriad functional nanostructures to facilitate the delivery of therapeutic agents for various medical applications. This review is focused on understanding the design and development of MTX-loaded nanoparticles alongside the inclusion of recent findings for the treatment of cancers. In this paper, we have made a coordinated effort to show the potential of novel drug delivery systems by achieving effective and target-specific delivery of methotrexate.\n## Lipid Polymer Hybrid Nanoparticles (LPHNPs)\nThe low solubility, dose-related toxicity, non-specificity, rapid diffusion throughout the body, short half-life in the bloodstream, and development of drug-resistance of conventional lipid-and polymer-based nanoparticles by the target cell (87) are some of the glaring issues with the existing drug-delivery vehicles. The innovative NDDS lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles (LPHNPs) combine the attributes of polymeric and lipid nanoparticles (PNPs) (46,(87)(88)(89). Lipophilic and poorly water-soluble drugs can be incorporated in the hydrophobic core of the polymer. They are prepared by two methods: (1) two-step (conventional and non-conventional) and (2) one-step (by nano-precipitation and emulsification-solvent-evaporation) (89,90). LPHNPs offer a versatile drug-delivery system with better drug entrapment, controlled and sustained drug release, great in vitro and in vivo stability (89). In addition, the lipid layer slows down the rate of polymer degradation of LPHNP products by limiting inward water diffusion and helps the sustained-release kinetics of loaded content (89). The properties of LPHNPs advocate for their utility and prove advantageous over existing delivery vehicles (87,91). Thus, well-designed LPHNPs contain hydrophobic polymeric core functions, whereas the surrounding lipid coat is a biocompatible shield and a barrier preventing the fast leakage of water-soluble drugs (92,93). Properties such as biocompatibility, biodegradability, sustained drug-release profiles, and greater loading capacity are attributed to a stable, high-payload, targeted drug-delivery system that might maximize chemotherapeutic efficacy against targeted cancer cells (90, 94). Recently, selfassembled polymer-lipid hybrid NPs were developed aiming at overcoming the limitations seen with conventional drug-delivery systems. The polymer-lipid hybrid NPs gained significant attention for drug and gene delivery (95,96).",

A pontine glioma develops in the brainstem's most vulnerable region (the \"pons\"), which regulates a number of vital processes like respiration and blood pressure. It is particularly challenging to treat due to its location and how it invades healthy brain tissue. The hunt for a solution is continually advancing thanks to advances in modern medicine, but the correct approach is still elusive. With a particular focus on brain tumours that are incurable or recur, research is ongoing to discover fresh, practical approaches to target particular areas of the brain. Experimental approach To successfully complete this task, a thorough literature search was carried out in reputable databases like Google Scholar, PubMed, and ScienceDirect. Key results The present article provides a comprehensive analysis of the notable advantages of lipid nanoparticles compared to alternative nanoparticle formulations. The article delves into the intricate realm of diverse lipid-based nanoparticulate delivery systems, which are used in Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG) which thoroughly examines preclinical and clinical studies, providing a comprehensive analysis of the effectiveness and potential of lipid nanoparticles in driving therapeutic advancements for DIPG. Conclusion There is strong clinical data to support the promising method of using lipid-based nanoparticulate drug delivery for brain cancer treatment, which shows improved outcomes.",

A pontine glioma develops in the brainstem's most vulnerable region (the \"pons\"), which regulates a number of vital processes like respiration and blood pressure. It is particularly challenging to treat due to its location and how it invades healthy brain tissue. The hunt for a solution is continually advancing thanks to advances in modern medicine, but the correct approach is still elusive. With a particular focus on brain tumours that are incurable or recur, research is ongoing to discover fresh, practical approaches to target particular areas of the brain. Experimental approach To successfully complete this task, a thorough literature search was carried out in reputable databases like Google Scholar, PubMed, and ScienceDirect. Key results The present article provides a comprehensive analysis of the notable advantages of lipid nanoparticles compared to alternative nanoparticle formulations. The article delves into the intricate realm of diverse lipid-based nanoparticulate delivery systems, which are used in Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG) which thoroughly examines preclinical and clinical studies, providing a comprehensive analysis of the effectiveness and potential of lipid nanoparticles in driving therapeutic advancements for DIPG. Conclusion There is strong clinical data to support the promising method of using lipid-based nanoparticulate drug delivery for brain cancer treatment, which shows improved outcomes.\n## Toxicity of lipid-based nanoparticles\nLipid-based nanoparticles have several benefits compared to other types of nanoparticles. Lipid nanocarriers such as liposomes, SLNs, and NLCs are ideal for incorporating both hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs, one of the major advantages of a combination of drugs that give dual targeting. They also have other advantages in terms of biocompatibility, shielding bioactive compounds from chemical deterioration, sitespecific controlled drug delivery, and high drug loading capacity, these nanocarriers are superior to the others in many ways. Stability during sterilization and ease of scaling up are two more benefits. At last, there is no reported toxicity for SLNs and NLCs up to date. Physiological lipids, generally accepted as safe (GRAS) excipients, make up the majority of these nanocarriers [75]. Before getting marketing authorization for these nanocarriers, their toxicity profile must be studied [103]. Further, we discuss the role of lipid-based nanoparticles in cytotoxicity, genotoxicity and hepatotoxicity.",

Natural compounds have emerged as a viable therapy to fill a huge gap in AD management, and in recent years, mostly fueled by the COVID-19 pandemic, RNA-based therapeutics have become a hot topic in the treatment of several diseases. Treatments of AD face significant limitations due to the complex and interconnected pathways that lead to their hallmarks and also due to the necessity to cross the blood\u2013brain barrier. Nanotechnology has contributed to surpassing this bottleneck in the treatment of AD by promoting safe and enhanced drug delivery to the brain.

LNPs range in size from 40 nm to 1000 nm and are colloidal lipophilic systems constituted by four main components: A pH-sensitive cationic lipid, a helper lipid, cholesterol, and a PEG-lipid. The cationic lipid is a synthetic lipid, constituted by a hydrophilic head with a protonable tertiary amino group (pKa 6-6.7) and a long hydrophobic tail. Cholesterol is incorporated into the LNPs formulation with the goal of increasing their flexibility, whilst the helper phospholipid assists in the process of endosomal escape and contributes to the stability of LNPs [135,136]. Finally, the insertion of a short-chain PEG-lipid derivative (normally of 14 carbon atoms) is essential to maximize the ex vivo stability and control the particle size before administration [137]. \n\nDue to their resemblance to biological and natural components, these nano systems show tremendous promise as carriers for therapeutic applications. The main advantages of LNPs over other nanoparticles are their low toxicity and biocompatibility, biodegradability, safety, high mechanical and chemical versatility, and the capacity to protect the active ingredient from degradation processes induced by external factors. Along with these features, these lipid-based nanoparticles can incorporate the delivery of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic molecules and most of their preparation methods can be easily scaled up.",

Ribeiro, Ivo Lopes, A. Gomes\n## Abstract\nWith the increment of the aging population in recent years, neurodegenerative diseases exert a major global disease burden, essentially as a result of the lack of treatments that stop the disease progression. Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD) is an example of a neurodegenerative disease that affects millions of people globally, with no effective treatment. Natural compounds have emerged as a viable therapy to fill a huge gap in AD management, and in recent years, mostly fueled by the COVID-19 pandemic, RNA-based therapeutics have become a hot topic in the treatment of several diseases. Treatments of AD face significant limitations due to the complex and interconnected pathways that lead to their hallmarks and also due to the necessity to cross the blood\u2013brain barrier. Nanotechnology has contributed to surpassing this bottleneck in the treatment of AD by promoting safe and enhanced drug delivery to the brain. In particular, exosome-like nanoparticles, a hybrid delivery system combining exosomes and liposomes\u2019 advantageous features, are demonstrating great potential in the treatment of central nervous system diseases.\n## Liposomes\nIn the last two decades, lipid-based nanoparticles (LNPs), especially liposomes, have been attractive nanometric delivery systems for being the most well-studied nonviral platforms for the delivery of RNA molecules and achieving significant clinical success [113,132] highlighted by the highly effective mRNA COVID-19 vaccines [132,133]. \n\nThere are several types of LNPs such as liposomes, niosomes, transfersomes, nanoemulsions, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), lipid nanocapsules (LNCs), nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs), lipid-based micelles, core-shell lipid nanoparticles (CLNs), and hybrid lipid-polymeric nanoparticles [132,134]. LNPs range in size from 40 nm to 1000 nm and are colloidal lipophilic systems constituted by four main components: A pH-sensitive cationic lipid, a helper lipid, cholesterol, and a PEG-lipid. The cationic lipid is a synthetic lipid, constituted by a hydrophilic head with a protonable tertiary amino group (pKa 6-6.7) and a long hydrophobic tail. Cholesterol is incorporated into the LNPs formulation with the goal of increasing their flexibility, whilst the helper phospholipid assists in the process of endosomal escape and contributes to the stability of LNPs [135,136]. Finally, the insertion of a short-chain PEG-lipid derivative (normally of 14 carbon atoms) is essential to maximize the ex vivo stability and control the particle size before administration [137]. \n\nDue to their resemblance to biological and natural components, these nano systems show tremendous promise as carriers for therapeutic applications. The main advantages of LNPs over other nanoparticles are their low toxicity and biocompatibility, biodegradability, safety, high mechanical and chemical versatility, and the capacity to protect the active ingredient from degradation processes induced by external factors. Along with these features, these lipid-based nanoparticles can incorporate the delivery of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic molecules and most of their preparation methods can be easily scaled up.",

The main hurdle in the clinical management of cancer is the development of multidrug resistance against chemotherapeutic agents. To overcome the limitations of chemotherapy, the researchers have been developing technological advances for significant progress in the oncotherapy by enabling the delivery of chemotherapeutic agents at increased drug content levels to the targeted spots. Several nano-drug delivery systems designed for tumor-targeting are evaluated in preclinical and clinical trials and showed promising outcomes in cancerous tumors\u2019 clinical management. This review describes nanocarrier\u2019s importance in managing different types of cancers and emphasizing nanocarriers for drug delivery and cancer nanotherapeutics. It also highlights the recent advances in nanocarriers-based delivery systems, including polymeric nanocarriers, micelles, nanotubes, dendrimers, magnetic nanoparticles, solid lipid nanoparticles, and quantum dots (QDs). The nanocarrier-based composites are discussed in terms of their structure, characteristics, and therapeutic applications in oncology. To conclude, the challenges and future exploration opportunities of nanocarriers in chemotherapeutics are also presented.",

It is acclaimed that solid lipid nanoparticles are biocompatible and have a low toxicity profile. In contrast to polymeric or inorganic nanoparticles, lipid-based nanocarriers are less toxic and biocompatible. 45,46 Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) hold a solid core of the lipid matrix that can dissolve the lipophilic molecules. The term lipid is used generally in a vast sense and includes triglycerides, partial glycerides, PEGylated lipids, fatty acids, steroids, and waxes. 47 The lipid core is balanced by using surfactants, as shown in Figure 4. The amount of emulsifier used depends on administration routes and is more limited for parenteral administrations. 48,49 In this drug delivery system, small-sized lipid core, surfactants and drugs are present in appropriate ratios showing some unbeatable properties that make them superior over other existing drug carriers. These SLN-based preparations have some unique characteristics, including high drug loading, and increased drug stability. These formulations have better feasibility of hydrophilic and lipophilic drug incorporation. Generally, SLNs are highly compatible owing to their composition similarity from physiological lipids. Exceptional ability to incorporate drugs into nanocarriers and size-dependent properties of SLN makes them an ideal candidate to develop novel therapeutic prototypes for drug delivery and targeting. SLN has the potential to enhance the efficiency of pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, and other materials. In comparison to phospholipids and biodegradable polymers, solid lipids are economical. [52][53] Applications of SLN In the recent past, SLN has emerged as a novel DDS for cancer research, including drug delivery, 54  targeting. 55,56 SLN, either single-handedly or in conjugation with other molecules, is extensively used in medicines, biomedical applications, bio-imaging, and photo-thermal therapy. 57 Anticancer agents are delivered with improved selectivity, and activity is enhanced when delivered via novel SLNs.",

Waqas, Muhammad Ijaz, Munazza Ijaz\n## Abstract\nAbstract Nanotechnology has been actively integrated as drug carriers over the last few years to treat various cancers. The main hurdle in the clinical management of cancer is the development of multidrug resistance against chemotherapeutic agents. To overcome the limitations of chemotherapy, the researchers have been developing technological advances for significant progress in the oncotherapy by enabling the delivery of chemotherapeutic agents at increased drug content levels to the targeted spots. Several nano-drug delivery systems designed for tumor-targeting are evaluated in preclinical and clinical trials and showed promising outcomes in cancerous tumors\u2019 clinical management. This review describes nanocarrier\u2019s importance in managing different types of cancers and emphasizing nanocarriers for drug delivery and cancer nanotherapeutics. It also highlights the recent advances in nanocarriers-based delivery systems, including polymeric nanocarriers, micelles, nanotubes, dendrimers, magnetic nanoparticles, solid lipid nanoparticles, and quantum dots (QDs). The nanocarrier-based composites are discussed in terms of their structure, characteristics, and therapeutic applications in oncology. To conclude, the challenges and future exploration opportunities of nanocarriers in chemotherapeutics are also presented.\n## Nanoparticles Developed from Solid Lipids\nNanoparticles developed from solid lipids are typically spherical, nano-sized (10 to 1,000 nm) colloidal carriers of natural or synthetic lipid-based drug delivery system. It is acclaimed that solid lipid nanoparticles are biocompatible and have a low toxicity profile. In contrast to polymeric or inorganic nanoparticles, lipid-based nanocarriers are less toxic and biocompatible. 45,46 Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) hold a solid core of the lipid matrix that can dissolve the lipophilic molecules. The term lipid is used generally in a vast sense and includes triglycerides, partial glycerides, PEGylated lipids, fatty acids, steroids, and waxes. 47 The lipid core is balanced by using surfactants, as shown in Figure 4. The amount of emulsifier used depends on administration routes and is more limited for parenteral administrations. 48,49 In this drug delivery system, small-sized lipid core, surfactants and drugs are present in appropriate ratios showing some unbeatable properties that make them superior over other existing drug carriers. These SLN-based preparations have some unique characteristics, including high drug loading, and increased drug stability. These formulations have better feasibility of hydrophilic and lipophilic drug incorporation. Generally, SLNs are highly compatible owing to their composition similarity from physiological lipids. Exceptional ability to incorporate drugs into nanocarriers and size-dependent properties of SLN makes them an ideal candidate to develop novel therapeutic prototypes for drug delivery and targeting. SLN has the potential to enhance the efficiency of pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, and other materials. In comparison to phospholipids and biodegradable polymers, solid lipids are economical. [52][53] Applications of SLN In the recent past, SLN has emerged as a novel DDS for cancer research, including drug delivery, 54  targeting. 55,56 SLN, either single-handedly or in conjugation with other molecules, is extensively used in medicines, biomedical applications, bio-imaging, and photo-thermal therapy. 57 Anticancer agents are delivered with improved selectivity, and activity is enhanced when delivered via novel SLNs.",

Although research on nanoparticles for brain cancer treatment is still in its early stages, these systems hold great potential to revolutionize drug delivery. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one of the most common and lethal brain tumors, and its heterogeneous and aggressive nature complicates current treatments, which primarily rely on surgery. One of the significant obstacles to effective treatment is the poor penetration of drugs across the BBB. Moreover, GBM is often referred to as a \u201ccold\u201d tumor, characterized by an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and minimal immune cell infiltration, which limits the effectiveness of immunotherapies. Therefore, developing novel, more effective treatments is critical to improving the survival rate of GBM patients. Current strategies for enhancing treatment outcomes focus on the controlled, targeted delivery of chemotherapeutic agents to GBM cells across the BBB using nanoparticles. These therapies must be designed to engage specialized transport systems, allowing for efficient BBB penetration, improved therapeutic efficacy, and reduced systemic toxicity and drug degradation. Lipid and inorganic nanoparticles can enhance brain delivery while minimizing side effects. These formulations may include epitopes\u2014small antigen fragments that bind directly to free antibodies, B cell receptors, or T cell receptors\u2014that interact with transport systems and enable BBB crossing, thereby boosting therapeutic efficacy. Lipid-based nanoparticles (LNPs), such as liposomes, niosomes, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs), are among the most promising delivery systems due to their unique properties, including their size, surface modification capabilities, and proven biosafety. Additionally, inorganic nanoparticles such as gold nanoparticles, mesoporous silica, superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles, and dendrimers offer promising alternatives. Inorganic nanoparticles (INPs) can be easily engineered, and their surfaces can be modified with various elements or biological ligands to enhance BBB penetration, targeted delivery, and biocompatibility. Strategies such as surface engineering and functionalization have been employed to ensure biocompatibility and reduce cytotoxicity, making these nanoparticles safer for clinical applications. The use of INPs in GBM treatment has shown promise in improving the efficacy of traditional therapies like chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and gene therapy, as well as advancing newer treatment strategies, including immunotherapy, photothermal and photodynamic therapies, and magnetic hyperthermia.

Patel\n## Abstract\nPhytopharmaceuticals, derived from plants, are increasingly recognized for their potential therapeutic benefits. However, their effectiveness is often hindered by challenges such as poor bioavailability, stability, and targeted delivery. In this study, we aimed to address these limitations by developing PCL (phosphatidylcholine) fortified nano-phytopharmaceuticals to enhance therapeutic efficacy.

These NPs are amphiphilic, being able to transfer both hydrophilic and hydrophobic materials in one particle [85]. Lipid-based carriers are made from biocompatible, biodegradable lipids similar to those consisting of the cell membrane. These features allow them to penetrate the cells efficiently and limit their toxicity. Most commonly used lipid-based NP formulations are (Figure 3) liposomes, nanoemulsions formed with micelles, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN), and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) [86,87]. These lipid-based NPs are often modified with polymers such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) or poloxamers. PEG is a hydrophilic polymer that is biocompatible and stabilizes NPs [88]. Furthermore, it acts as a mucus penetration enhancer by decreasing interaction with mucin [76]. Poloxamers, similar to PEG, are water-soluble, non-ionic surfactants and consist of a triblock copolymer of hydrophobic polypropylene glycol and two hydrophilic blocks of PEG. They have low toxicity, good drug release, and are compatible with many different chemicals, making them useful tools for drug delivery [89]. Poloxamer 407 (Pluronic F127) and 188 (Pluronic F-68) both have high contents of PEG (70% and 80%, respectively) and can help decrease mucus viscosity and increase penetration by interacting with lipid membranes and tight junctions [90,91]. \n\nand hydrophilicity of original nanocarriers through nanoparticle-biomolecule interactions [78]. Also, the pharmacokinetic profile, such as cellular uptake, half-life, and distribution can be modified [79,80]. The biocorona can be recognized by complement receptors on macrophages and undergo increased cellular uptake and accumulated in the liver and spleen [81]. Some studies showed that metal-based nanoparticles may cause negative effects on the cardiovascular system and the nervous system.",

Minko\n## Abstract\nTreatment of neurodegenerative diseases or other central nervous system (CNS) disorders has always been a significant challenge. The nature of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) limits the penetration of therapeutic molecules to the brain after oral or parenteral administration, which, in combination with hepatic metabolism and drug elimination and inactivation during its journey in the systemic circulation, decreases the efficacy of the treatment, requires high drug doses and often induces adverse side effects. Nose-to-brain drug delivery allows the direct transport of therapeutic molecules by bypassing the BBB and increases drug concentration in the brain. The present review describes mechanisms of nose-to-brain drug delivery and discusses recent advances in this area with especial emphasis on nanotechnology-based approaches.\n## Lipid-Based Nanoparticles\nLipid-based nanoparticles have been widely investigated for drug delivery systems. These NPs are amphiphilic, being able to transfer both hydrophilic and hydrophobic materials in one particle [85]. Lipid-based carriers are made from biocompatible, biodegradable lipids similar to those consisting of the cell membrane. These features allow them to penetrate the cells efficiently and limit their toxicity. Most commonly used lipid-based NP formulations are (Figure 3) liposomes, nanoemulsions formed with micelles, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN), and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) [86,87]. These lipid-based NPs are often modified with polymers such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) or poloxamers. PEG is a hydrophilic polymer that is biocompatible and stabilizes NPs [88]. Furthermore, it acts as a mucus penetration enhancer by decreasing interaction with mucin [76]. Poloxamers, similar to PEG, are water-soluble, non-ionic surfactants and consist of a triblock copolymer of hydrophobic polypropylene glycol and two hydrophilic blocks of PEG. They have low toxicity, good drug release, and are compatible with many different chemicals, making them useful tools for drug delivery [89]. Poloxamer 407 (Pluronic F127) and 188 (Pluronic F-68) both have high contents of PEG (70% and 80%, respectively) and can help decrease mucus viscosity and increase penetration by interacting with lipid membranes and tight junctions [90,91]. \n\nand hydrophilicity of original nanocarriers through nanoparticle-biomolecule interactions [78]. Also, the pharmacokinetic profile, such as cellular uptake, half-life, and distribution can be modified [79,80]. The biocorona can be recognized by complement receptors on macrophages and undergo increased cellular uptake and accumulated in the liver and spleen [81]. Some studies showed that metal-based nanoparticles may cause negative effects on the cardiovascular system and the nervous system.",

The drawbacks of using this system are low drug loading, difficulty in obtaining uniform particle dispersion, toxicity, and drug expulsion during storage. 46 Recent advancements in this system, such as nanostructured lipid carriers, lipid-drug conjugates, and hybrid lipid polymer nanoparticles, are strategies to overcome the limitations of solid lipid nanoparticles. \n\nNanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) are an effective alternative to solid lipid nanoparticles. They comprise a lipid core comprising both liquid and solid lipids (Fig. 2). The presence of both lipids leads to a less perfect crystalline structure with more defects/spaces for drug loading. 47 Polymeric nanoparticles are nanosized colloidal systems of polymeric materials with drugs entrapped in the core (nanocapsule) or the polymer matrix (nanosphere). Biocompatible and biodegradable natural or synthetic polymers are employed to formulate polymer nanoparticles. Polymeric nanoparticles have higher storage stability, higher circulation half-life in the biological system, and a bettercontrolled release profile. 48 The lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticle is an emerging type of lipid nanoparticle, a blend of polymer and lipid nanoparticles. The polymeric core is surrounded by a phospholipid layer coated with a lipid-PEG shell 49 (Fig. 2).

Onuigbo\n## Abstract\nThe effective delivery of therapeutic agents is as vital as the active therapeutic agent as it may make or mar the outcome. The traditional/conventional drug delivery systems (DDS) have been...\n## Nanocarriers in drug delivery\nThe solid-state of the lipid core at body temperature increases the stability of this system. They can be easily modified to control drug release and targeting. The drawbacks of using this system are low drug loading, difficulty in obtaining uniform particle dispersion, toxicity, and drug expulsion during storage. 46 Recent advancements in this system, such as nanostructured lipid carriers, lipid-drug conjugates, and hybrid lipid polymer nanoparticles, are strategies to overcome the limitations of solid lipid nanoparticles. \n\nNanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) are an effective alternative to solid lipid nanoparticles. They comprise a lipid core comprising both liquid and solid lipids (Fig. 2). The presence of both lipids leads to a less perfect crystalline structure with more defects/spaces for drug loading. 47 Polymeric nanoparticles are nanosized colloidal systems of polymeric materials with drugs entrapped in the core (nanocapsule) or the polymer matrix (nanosphere). Biocompatible and biodegradable natural or synthetic polymers are employed to formulate polymer nanoparticles. Polymeric nanoparticles have higher storage stability, higher circulation half-life in the biological system, and a bettercontrolled release profile. 48 The lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticle is an emerging type of lipid nanoparticle, a blend of polymer and lipid nanoparticles. The polymeric core is surrounded by a phospholipid layer coated with a lipid-PEG shell 49 (Fig. 2). A system's mixture of lipid and polymer results in higher mechanical strength, biocompatibility, high payload for both hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs and controlled drug release. 50 bilayers. Based on the number and size of the bilayer, liposomes can be classified into small or large unilamellar or multilamellar liposomes. 51 Liposomal drug delivery systems show biocompatibility and biodegradability properties. They are biocompatible owing to their structural similarity with cell membranes. Both hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds can be encapsulated in this carrier.",

Lipid-based nanoparticles have played a pivotal role in the successes of COVID-19 vaccines and many other nanomedicines, such as Doxil\u00ae and Onpattro\u00ae, and have therefore been considered as the frontrunner in nanoscale drug delivery systems. In this review, we aim to highlight the progress in the development of these lipid nanoparticles for various applications, ranging from cancer nanomedicines to COVID-19 vaccines. The lipid-based nanoparticles discussed in this review are liposomes, niosomes, transfersomes, solid lipid nanoparticles, and nanostructured lipid carriers. We particularly focus on the innovations that have obtained regulatory approval or that are in clinical trials. We also discuss the physicochemical properties required for specific applications, highlight the differences in requirements for the delivery of different cargos, and introduce current challenges that need further development. This review serves as a useful guideline for designing new lipid nanoparticles for both preventative and therapeutic vaccines including immunotherapies.",

                    "text": "Studies have suggested that the structure and pKa of the ionizable lipids play a crucial role in the delivery efficiency of the cargo to the target cells [5,18,19]. For example, Dlin-MC3-DMA, the ionizable lipid in Onpattro (Figure 1b), with a pKa of 6.44, has a 10-fold higher potency than (2,2-dilinoleyl-4-(2-dimethylaminoethyl)- [1,3]dioxolane, DLin-KC2-DMA) with a pKa of 6.7 [20,21]. However, it should be noted that subtle differences in the lipid structure can induce variations in the structural packing of LNP's, resulting in a different morphology and delivery profile. To improve the particle stability, DSPC, with two saturated acyl chains and a large head group, is incorporated into the formulation (Figure 1b). These lipids produce a cylindrical geometry and play the role of helper lipids in the LNP to maintain the outer layer structure and increase the Onpattro's formation [22]. The PEG-DMG lipids on the particle surface (Figure 1a,b) prevent particle aggregation due to stealth properties and prolong the circulation time in vivo. Altogether, this LNP system has a solid core structure, a low surface charge at physiological media, and low immunogenicity [16]. This technology has sparked interest in further developing genetic therapies and novel delivery systems. Lipid-based nanoparticles are a particularly promising vehicle [11,23,24] for gene delivery with their higher biocompatibility than polymeric and inorganic nanoparticles, their inherent penetrating ability, their biodegradability, structural flexibility, and low immunogenicity [25,26]. These nanostructures can also be produced rapidly at large scale, which is a major advantage when moving into clinical trials and commercial applications [25]. \n\nSince the success of Doxil, Onpattro, and various other LNPs in clinical trials, a myriad of studies has been conducted to translate R&D efforts into commercial products.",

H. Thi, Estelle J A Suys, J. S. Lee, D. Nguyen, K. Park, N. Truong\n## Abstract\nCOVID-19 vaccines have been developed with unprecedented speed which would not have been possible without decades of fundamental research on delivery nanotechnology. Lipid-based nanoparticles have played a pivotal role in the successes of COVID-19 vaccines and many other nanomedicines, such as Doxil\u00ae and Onpattro\u00ae, and have therefore been considered as the frontrunner in nanoscale drug delivery systems. In this review, we aim to highlight the progress in the development of these lipid nanoparticles for various applications, ranging from cancer nanomedicines to COVID-19 vaccines. The lipid-based nanoparticles discussed in this review are liposomes, niosomes, transfersomes, solid lipid nanoparticles, and nanostructured lipid carriers. We particularly focus on the innovations that have obtained regulatory approval or that are in clinical trials. We also discuss the physicochemical properties required for specific applications, highlight the differences in requirements for the delivery of different cargos, and introduce current challenges that need further development. This review serves as a useful guideline for designing new lipid nanoparticles for both preventative and therapeutic vaccines including immunotherapies.\n## Introduction\nStudies have suggested that the structure and pKa of the ionizable lipids play a crucial role in the delivery efficiency of the cargo to the target cells [5,18,19]. For example, Dlin-MC3-DMA, the ionizable lipid in Onpattro (Figure 1b), with a pKa of 6.44, has a 10-fold higher potency than (2,2-dilinoleyl-4-(2-dimethylaminoethyl)- [1,3]dioxolane, DLin-KC2-DMA) with a pKa of 6.7 [20,21]. However, it should be noted that subtle differences in the lipid structure can induce variations in the structural packing of LNP's, resulting in a different morphology and delivery profile. To improve the particle stability, DSPC, with two saturated acyl chains and a large head group, is incorporated into the formulation (Figure 1b). These lipids produce a cylindrical geometry and play the role of helper lipids in the LNP to maintain the outer layer structure and increase the Onpattro's formation [22]. The PEG-DMG lipids on the particle surface (Figure 1a,b) prevent particle aggregation due to stealth properties and prolong the circulation time in vivo. Altogether, this LNP system has a solid core structure, a low surface charge at physiological media, and low immunogenicity [16]. This technology has sparked interest in further developing genetic therapies and novel delivery systems. Lipid-based nanoparticles are a particularly promising vehicle [11,23,24] for gene delivery with their higher biocompatibility than polymeric and inorganic nanoparticles, their inherent penetrating ability, their biodegradability, structural flexibility, and low immunogenicity [25,26]. These nanostructures can also be produced rapidly at large scale, which is a major advantage when moving into clinical trials and commercial applications [25]. \n\nSince the success of Doxil, Onpattro, and various other LNPs in clinical trials, a myriad of studies has been conducted to translate R&D efforts into commercial products.",

Liposomes are the first nano system approved for protein and drug delivery [37]. LNPs originate from liposomes that deliver small-molecule drugs and are cationic, spherical vesicles. They are composed of phospholipids and cholesterol [38]. They demonstrate high biocompatibility and can enter the cytoplasm through natural biological processes like membrane fusion, owing to the phospholipid bilayer of the plasma membrane [39]. LNPs have been shown to reduce drug toxicity, enhance drug stability, and improve drug bioavailability [40]. Studies have indicated that LNPs are effective immune stimulators in mRNA-based vaccine delivery and enhance the efficacy of protein subunit vaccines [41,42]. Many LNPs-based siRNA drugs have entered the clinical trial stage [43]. However, LNPs also have some disadvantages, such as their complex composition, relatively lower stability, and targeting efficacy [44,45]. Leakage may occur when loaded with drugs, and increasing the dose can have toxic side effects on the organism [46]. Additionally, emulsifiers that produce toxicity to the body further limit the potential application of cationic NPs [47].",

Lipid-based nanocarriers or nanoparticles (LNPs) have various favourable properties, making them an ideal choice. LNPs are characteristically spherical and possess a lipid solid core with a matrix containing soluble lipophilic molecules. As cell membranes are mainly composed of lipids and phospholipids, lipid-based nanocarriers as a drug transport have the natural advantage of better interaction with cells, and therefore facilitating better cellular uptake of transported drug [74]. Furthermore, lipid nanoparticle materials are biocompatible and biodegradable [75]. Several notable classes of lipid-based nanocarriers have been studied for RNA delivery, including liposomes, solid lipid-based nanoparticles, nanostructured lipid carriers, lipidoid nanoparticles, lipophilic conjugates, transfersomes, lipospheres and nanoemulsions. [14,76,77]. It is important to note that there are many other lipid-based carrier systems out there; however, Table 1 summarises some of them and their advantages. Positively charged carriers that include stable nucleic acid-lipid particles (SNALPs) and solid-lipid nanoparticles (SLNs).

Their biocompatibility, ability to encapsulate a wide range of therapeutic and diagnostic agents, and potential for surface modification make them ideal candidates for targeted and personalized medicine. Continued research in the development and synthesis of chemically modified LNPs to achieve tunable biodegradability in vivo would allow the optimization of delivery vehicles, making them more versatile, highly efficient, and biocompatible. Advances in nanoparticle design have significantly improved their stability, targeting efficiency, and controlled-release properties, addressing some of the major challenges in current medical treatments. It is important to note that, among the various types of lipid nanoparticles, liposomes are currently the only lipid-based carriers for theranostics that are undergoing clinical trials. This highlights their established safety profile and efficacy, setting a milestone for other lipid nanoparticles in the theranostic field. \n\nHowever, despite the promising results, several hurdles remain to be overcome before lipid nanoparticles can be widely adopted in clinical practice. These include their potential toxicity, the scalability of their production, regulatory approval, and the need for more comprehensive in vivo studies to fully understand their long-term effects and efficacy. Furthermore, combining diagnostic and therapeutic functionalities into a single nanoparticle system poses additional challenges in terms of design and functionality. \n\nFor these reasons, the use of LNPs in medicine is expected to expand significantly. The development of different types of LNPs with optimized drug delivery properties, such as nanostructured lipid carriers and ionizable cationic nanoparticles, brings additional advantages to LNP formulations and broadens the perspectives of their applications [139]. \n\nFuture research should focus on the development of more sophisticated nanoparticle systems, improving targeting accuracy, and ensuring safe and cost-effective production methods. Interdisciplinary collaboration among chemists, biologists, engineers, and medical professionals will be crucial to advance this technology from the laboratory to the clinic. \n\nIn conclusion, lipid nanoparticles hold great potential for revolutionizing the field of theranostics by pioneering more efficient and individualized treatment approaches.",

The use of organic nanoparticles over inorganic nanoparticles is highly recognized in the biomedical sector due to various safety concerns and may prove beneficial in efficiently carrying or supplying the drug load (Mitragotri and Stayton 2014;McClements and Xiao 2017). \n\nLipid-based nanoparticles, liposomes and niosomes Nanoparticles made from lipids have proven their potential in advanced medicine as an extremely efficient biocompatible platform for therapeutics. Anomalous bio-absorbable and biocompatible properties of lipid-based NPs have created interesting opportunities for these nanosystems (Joshy et al. 2017). To check drug release parameters for hemocompatibility and non-toxic viral inhibition in cell lines VK2/E6E7 challenged with human papillomavirus (HPV), Gao et al. (2018) developed a nanostructured nanolipid carrier loaded with podophyllotoxin (POD). Both the types of lipid-based NPs that are solid-lipid NPs and nanostuctured lipid nanocarriers have been reported as vehicles for successful antiviral delivery against certain viruses, such as HIV, Hepatitis C virus, and HPV. Still, their therapy efficiency against SARS-CoV-2 has yet to be assessed. Using solid-lipid nanoparticles has additional benefits include increased toxicity compared to synthetic polymer nanoparticles, with better drug release profiles (Patel and Patravale 2011;Xie et al. 2014).

They are novel bionanomaterials that can be used to encapsulate a wide range of biomolecules, such as mRNA, as demonstrated by the current successes of COVID\u201019 mRNA vaccines. Therefore, it is important to provide a perspective on LNPs for RNA delivery, which further offers useful guidance for researchers who want to work in the RNA\u2010based LNP field. This perspective first summarizes the approaches for the preparation of LNPs, followed by the introduction of the key characterization parameters. Then, the in vitro cell experiments to study LNP performance, including cell selection, cell viability, cellular association/uptake, endosomal escape, and their efficacy, were summarized. Finally, the in vivo animal experiments in the aspects of animal selection, administration, dosing and safety, and their therapeutic efficacy were discussed. The authors hope this perspective can offer valuable guidance to researchers who enter the field of RNA\u2010based LNPs and help them understand the crucial parameters that RNA\u2010based LNPs demand.",

            "text": "In the last two decades, lipid-based nanoparticles (LNPs), especially liposomes, have been attractive nanometric delivery systems for being the most well-studied nonviral platforms for the delivery of RNA molecules and achieving significant clinical success [113,132] highlighted by the highly effective mRNA COVID-19 vaccines [132,133]. \n\nThere are several types of LNPs such as liposomes, niosomes, transfersomes, nanoemulsions, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), lipid nanocapsules (LNCs), nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs), lipid-based micelles, core-shell lipid nanoparticles (CLNs), and hybrid lipid-polymeric nanoparticles [132,134]. LNPs range in size from 40 nm to 1000 nm and are colloidal lipophilic systems constituted by four main components: A pH-sensitive cationic lipid, a helper lipid, cholesterol, and a PEG-lipid. The cationic lipid is a synthetic lipid, constituted by a hydrophilic head with a protonable tertiary amino group (pKa 6-6.7) and a long hydrophobic tail. Cholesterol is incorporated into the LNPs formulation with the goal of increasing their flexibility, whilst the helper phospholipid assists in the process of endosomal escape and contributes to the stability of LNPs [135,136]. Finally, the insertion of a short-chain PEG-lipid derivative (normally of 14 carbon atoms) is essential to maximize the ex vivo stability and control the particle size before administration [137]. \n\nDue to their resemblance to biological and natural components, these nano systems show tremendous promise as carriers for therapeutic applications. The main advantages of LNPs over other nanoparticles are their low toxicity and biocompatibility, biodegradability, safety, high mechanical and chemical versatility, and the capacity to protect the active ingredient from degradation processes induced by external factors. Along with these features, these lipid-based nanoparticles can incorporate the delivery of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic molecules and most of their preparation methods can be easily scaled up.",

A variety of delivery platform vehicles are under development to target immune cells, such as antibodies (16), polymers (17), aptamers (18), and lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) (19,20). In comparison to other NPs, LNPs have attractive biological properties, which include general biocompatibility, biodegradability, and the ability to entrap both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs (15,21). Multiple properties of LNPs can be altered via different lipid composition and ratios or by surface chemistry, including their size, charge, and surface functionality (22). LNPs serve as carriers for a variety of therapeutic molecules: from nucleic acid to proteins, small molecules and chemotherapy drugs, and combinations of the aforementioned agents (22)(23)(24). LNPs shelter their cargo from clearance in the surrounding biological milieu, increasing the half-life in circulation, minimizing systemic toxicity, and hence enabling a wide therapeutic window (15,22,25). In addition, LNPs can promote delivery of their cargo directly to specific immune cell, such as APC or T-lymphocytes (20,26,27). Here, we review the latest developments in nanoparticle-based cancer immunotherapy, centering on LNPs.",

            "text": "Nanotechnology has emerged as a promising approach to delivering mRNA molecules, enabling the development of mRNA-based therapeutics such as vaccines and gene therapies. Nanotechnology-based delivery systems, including lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), polymeric nanoparticles, and inorganic nanoparticles, offer unique advantages for mRNA delivery, such as protection from enzymatic degradation, improved cellular uptake, enhanced intracellular trafficking, and the controlled release of mRNA. Here, we discuss the role of nanotechnology in mRNA delivery and its potential applications. \n\nLipid nanoparticles (LNPs): LNPs are one of the most-used nanocarriers for mRNA delivery. They comprise lipids that can self-assemble into nanoparticles, encapsulating mRNA within their lipid bilayers. LNPs can protect mRNA from enzymatic degradation, facilitate cellular uptake through endocytosis, and promote endosomal escape, allowing mRNA to reach the cytoplasm, where it can be translated into protein. LNPs have been successfully used for the delivery of mRNA in mRNA vaccines against infectious diseases such as COVID-19, as well as for mRNA-based gene therapies for genetic disorders. \n\nPolymeric nanoparticles: Polymeric nanoparticles are another type of nanocarrier that can be used for mRNA delivery. These nanoparticles are typically composed of biocompatible and biodegradable polymers, such as poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), polyethyleneimine (PEI), and polyethylene glycol (PEG). Polymeric nanoparticles can encapsulate mRNA within their matrix or conjugate mRNA onto their surface, providing protection and stability to mRNA during delivery. Polymeric nanoparticles can also be engineered to have specific surface properties, such as charge and size, to optimize the cellular uptake and intracellular trafficking of mRNA. \n\nInorganic nanoparticles: Inorganic nanoparticles, such as gold and silica nanoparticles, have also been explored for mRNA delivery.",

            "text": "Use of nanoparticle has shown great potential as novel drug delivery systems. The ability to deliver drugs more effectively and efficiently to the site of interest translates into less harmful systemic side effects and more beneficial therapeutic action [1]. Nanoparticulate delivery systems such as liposomes and polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) have been extensively developed for delivering a variety of bioactive molecules such as drugs, genes, proteins, and targeting ligands [2,3]. Among these delivery systems, liposomes are spherical lipid vesicles with a bilayer structure of natural or synthetic amphiphilic lipid molecules. Liposomes have been widely used as drug delivery vesicles because of their biocompatible, biodegradable, nontoxic, flexible, and non-immunogenic properties for systemic and local administration. Furthermore, the lipid materials are able to fuse with the cell membrane and enhance the cell internalization of liposomes. However, liposomes have several limitations from the viewpoint of physical and chemical stability, batch-to-batch reproducibility, sterilization and manufacturing scale-up [4,5]. On the other hand, polymeric nanoparticles possess high structural integrity afforded by the rigidity of the polymer matrix, and are thus inherently more stable than liposomes [6,7]. The limitations of polymeric NPs include use of toxic organic solvents in the production process, poor drug encapsulation for hydrophilic drugs, polymer cytotoxicity and polymer degradation [8]. \n\nThe lipid-polymer hybrid NPs (LPNs) combining the positive attributes of both liposomes and polymeric NPs are increasingly being considered as promising candidates to carry therapeutic agents safely and efficiently [9,10]. LPNs are polymeric nanoparticles enveloped by lipid layers [11]. The inclusion of lipid coat enables the hybrid nanoparticles to encapsulate not only water-insoluble drugs, but also water-soluble drugs with greater encapsulation efficiency. LPNs exhibit high structural integrity, stability during storage, and controlled release capability attributed to the polymer core, and high biocompatibility and bioavailability owed to the lipid layer [12,13].",

Indeed, other nucleic acid systems such as polymers or inorganic metal nanoparticles have the advantage of simple preparation, but suffer from the disadvantages of low delivery efficiency and poor safety; extracellular vesicles have good biocompatibility, but their production and quality control are still challenging. The development of novel potentially ionizable lipid molecules for LNP is a long and difficult task. In this study, we innovatively incorporated a fifth antiinflammatory lipid into the formulation, drawing from the tetralipid composition of conventional lipid nanoparticles, to mitigate inflammation in immune cells through RNAi technology. Rationally designed anti-inflammatory LNPs for topical application in psoriasis were synthesized and characterized. The delivery efficiency, anti-inflammatory effects, and therapeutic potential of these LNPs for the treatment of psoriasis were subsequently validated in vitro and in vivo.",

            "text": "The underlying concept of LNPs as a well-tolerated carrier system is well established and documented. It was observed that the lipids employed in the preparation of LNPs such as liposomes, nanoemulsion, SLNs, NLCs, and LPH-NPs are non-toxic, biocompatible, and biodegradable with poor or no immunogenicity. The lipids have the capacity of forming nanostructure and have been investigated extensively as a nanocarrier for cancer-targeted drug delivery system. It was further concluded that the physicochemical properties of lipids provide the opportunity to optimize the drug delivery system by customizing their geometrical parameters which include particle size, morphology, entrapment efficiency, drug loading, and in vitro drug release profile. Further, the LNPs show passive targeting as well as active targeting if surface-functionalized, which enhances the therapeutic efficacy as well as targeting the cancer site. However, there exists certain reluctance regarding the efficacy and safety of LNPs which are overturned by the advent of reliable GRAS-regulated lipids, cGMP-grade manufacturing processes, and preclinical data related to their ADME status and toxicity, followed by fruitful first-in-man studies. It was further expected that the LNPs might be the first nanoparticle forming an impact on the management and treatment of cancer. Likewise, Doxil nanoparticles were observed as the first of a wave of novel LNPmediated drug delivery systems that could deliver a transformative impact on anticancer therapeutics in the years to come.",

            "text": "Nanoparticles have transformed drug delivery, spanning sizes from 1 to 1000 nm. This innovation promises enhanced drug efficacy while minimizing side effects. These nanoparticles enable precise drug delivery to target cells, controlled release, and targeted distribution through surface modification with ligands. They are currently being developed as drug delivery systems for various substances and vaccines on the market, including AmBisome, DepoCyt, Doxil, Inflexal, Myocet, Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines, and Moderna mRNA vaccines. 1,2 Nanoparticles have garnered significant attention in drug delivery due to their unique properties, such as a high surface area-to-volume ratio, the ability to traverse biological barriers, and the capacity to encapsulate both hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs. Various types of nanoparticles, including polymeric, inorganic, and lipid-based nanoparticles, have been developed for drug delivery applications. 3 ipid-based nanoparticles (LNPs) constitute a subclass of nanoparticles composed primarily of lipids, which have garnered significant attention in recent years. LNPs present several advantages over alternative nanoparticle systems, including high stability, biocompatibility, and the capability to target specific cells or tissues. This targeted approach enhances drug efficacy while mitigating side effects. Moreover, the customization of LNPs through surface modification with targeting ligands further refines their specificity toward desired cells or tissues, thus optimizing drug delivery efficiency. Structurally, LNPs typically comprise a lipid bilayer surrounding an aqueous core, forming a versatile platform for drug encapsulation. This architecture facilitates the encapsulation of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs within the lipid bilayer or aqueous core, respectively, enabling the simultaneous delivery of multiple therapeutic agents. Moreover, the lipid bilayer contributes to the stability of LNPs in biological environments, shielding encapsulated drugs from degradation and extending their circulation time in the bloodstream. 3,4 LNPs can be synthesized using various techniques, such as sonication, 5 microfluidics, 6 and extrusion. 7",

LNPs like liposomes, emulsions, nanocapsules, nanospheres, solid lipid nanoparticles, nanostructured lipid carriers, and exosomes are employed in drug delivery and the diagnosis of cancer [186,187]. LNPs are spherical nanovesicles comprised of phospholipids, cholesterol, and solid and liquid lipids, and are used to entrap hydrophobic drugs as well as hydrophilic drugs. In addition to these, they also contain surfactants and co-surfactants used to reduce the interfacial tension between two phases and form a monophasic layer. Various anticancer therapeutics have already been formulated as liposomal formulations such as lipoplatin, which is a cisplatin-loaded liposome [188]. Various studies inferred that compared to PNPs, LNPs are considered more beneficial for treatment, because the LNPs are composed of GRAS-recognized biocompatible and biodegradable lipids, making them safe for delivery [189]. was observed that the ICAM-1-targeted Lcn2-liposomes mediated a strong interaction or binding with the TNBC cells (MDA-MB-231) compared to the interaction of the noncancerous cells (MCF-10A) with the TNBC cells. Additionally, it was observed that the knockdown of Lcn2 through ICAM-1-targeted Lcn2-liposomes resulted in a significant decrease in the generation of VEGF (Figure 9), which led to decreased angiogenesis both in vitro as well as in vivo [190]. Zhang et al., 2019 prepared nanoparticles loaded with paclitaxel amino lipid derivative and P53 mRNA for the effective treatment of TNBC by specifically targeting the mutated TP53.",

            "text": "The low solubility, dose-related toxicity, non-specificity, rapid diffusion throughout the body, short half-life in the bloodstream, and development of drug-resistance of conventional lipid-and polymer-based nanoparticles by the target cell (87) are some of the glaring issues with the existing drug-delivery vehicles. The innovative NDDS lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles (LPHNPs) combine the attributes of polymeric and lipid nanoparticles (PNPs) (46,(87)(88)(89). Lipophilic and poorly water-soluble drugs can be incorporated in the hydrophobic core of the polymer. They are prepared by two methods: (1) two-step (conventional and non-conventional) and (2) one-step (by nano-precipitation and emulsification-solvent-evaporation) (89,90). LPHNPs offer a versatile drug-delivery system with better drug entrapment, controlled and sustained drug release, great in vitro and in vivo stability (89). In addition, the lipid layer slows down the rate of polymer degradation of LPHNP products by limiting inward water diffusion and helps the sustained-release kinetics of loaded content (89). The properties of LPHNPs advocate for their utility and prove advantageous over existing delivery vehicles (87,91). Thus, well-designed LPHNPs contain hydrophobic polymeric core functions, whereas the surrounding lipid coat is a biocompatible shield and a barrier preventing the fast leakage of water-soluble drugs (92,93). Properties such as biocompatibility, biodegradability, sustained drug-release profiles, and greater loading capacity are attributed to a stable, high-payload, targeted drug-delivery system that might maximize chemotherapeutic efficacy against targeted cancer cells (90, 94). Recently, selfassembled polymer-lipid hybrid NPs were developed aiming at overcoming the limitations seen with conventional drug-delivery systems. The polymer-lipid hybrid NPs gained significant attention for drug and gene delivery (95,96).",

Nanodelivery systems could overcome these limitations, such as covalent attachment of biocompatible polymers (e.g., polyethylene glycol (PEG) and other synthetic or naturally derived macromolecules) and protein nanoencapsulation in colloidal systems (e.g., liposomes and other lipid or polymeric nanocarriers) [16]. \n\nGenerally, lipid-based delivery systems could act as an effective vector for enhancing the potency of vaccines and inducing effective immune protection against severe infectious and non-infectious diseases. However, the physical and chemical properties of lipidic carriers can influence their efficiency and safety in vaccine development. Characterization of these systems is a complex process. Indeed, size, charge, architecture, and composition need to be characterized to develop a standard lipid nanoparticle. Moreover, the safety and toxicity profiles of each novel nanoparticle should be determined to avoid unpredictable adverse effects. The design of lipidic delivery system is more complex with adding surface modification and with coatings and/or ligands. Thus, it is required to optimize a suitable and potent vaccine/ lipid formulation for in vivo studies. This review represents the efficiency of lipid-based delivery systems for development of nucleic acid-and protein-based vaccines in preclinical and clinical trials (Graphical Abstract).",

            "text": "Nanotechnology has been widely used to improve the oral absorption and therapeutic efficacy of small molecule peptide drugs, which have shown tremendous potentials but great challenges (Olbrich et al., 2001;Tan et al., 2009;Li et al., 2013;Yang et al., 2013;Thi et al., 2015;Wang et al., 2018). Poly-(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) nanoparticles have attracted much attention, owing to the unique properties of biodegradability, biocompatibility, and sustained release (Musumeci et al., 2006). Liposomes also have been applied for drug delivery due to the superior biocompatibility, drug absorption and nontoxicity (Wang and Liu, 2013). Unfortunately, both of them have some unsatisfied disadvantages in peptide delivery, such as leakage and safety issues, which seriously limited the delivery efficiency. It is necessary to deal with these problems for improving the oral delivery efficiency of peptides (Luo et al., 2006).\n\nLipid coating PLGA nanoparticles system (lipid nanoparticles, LNPs) has not only combined the advantages of polymer nanoparticles and liposomes but efficiently avoided the defects of them (Muller and Keck, 2004;Alavi et al., 2017). The dual advantages of the particles and vesicle make it an excellent oral drug carrier with high biocompatibility and sustained release (Xie et al., 2018). In this system, drugs can be efficiently encapsulated in the nanoparticles core and/or the lipid bilayers, resulted in increased drug load capability. The drug diffusion rate can be delayed by the polymer core. Additionally, the stability of the LNPs can be further increased by the lipid shell (Nogu\u00e9s et al., 2006). However, it is still challenging to achieve high encapsulation efficiency (EE) and decent particle size when incorporating hydrophilic drugs into LNPs.\n\nHypertension has become a strong risk factor for cardiovascular disease and affected almost 2 billion people. In detail, it has highly correlated with the heart attack, cerebral hemorrhage, stroke, kidney failure and blindness (Kje",

            "text": "Generally, there are two types of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) [103]. Both SLNs and NLCs have spherical shape and their average size usually ranges from 40 to 1000 nm. LNPs can be produced by several techniques such as highpressure or high-speed homogenization, supercritical fluid extraction of emulsions, solvent emulsification/evaporation, spray drying, and ultrasonication [104][105][106].\n\nLNPs are composed of a lipid solid matrix lipid and surfactants that provide stability [107]. SLN matrix is constituted by biocompatible, biodegradable, and GRAS solid lipids, which are solid at room and body temperature (e.g., highly purified triglycerides, partial glycerides, fatty acids, and steroids) [108]. The matrix of NCLs is also solid at room/body temperature; however, unlike SLNs, often it is composed of a mixture of solid and liquid lipids [101]. Figure 5 shows a scheme of these formulations, where structural differences between both LNPs are observed.\n\nIn the last years, a great attention has been paid to LNPs as an interesting and cost-effective alternative to polymeric nanoparticles, liposomes, and emulsions. LNPs are cheaper and safer than polymeric carriers, as their production is an organic solvent-free process [103]. Likewise, compared to conventional liposomes, nanoparticle solid matrix allows a higher control release and specific delivery of the loaded agent, which minimizes side effects [109]. LNPs show other benefits as compared to other systems, including ease of preparation and high scale production and sterilization [110,111], excellent physical stability, and chemical versatility. Moreover, incorporation into the nanoparticle matrix can protect molecules from light, moisture, chemical degradation, and oxidation [109] and favor their penetration through mucus barrier due to nanosize [103,[112][113][114].\n\n(i) Solid Lipid Nanoparticles (SLNs).

            "text": "The lipids used to prepare biocompatible and biodegradable nanoparticles are usually naturally-occurring molecules with low acute and chronic toxicity. In the case of polymeric nanoparticles, the in vivo degradation of the polymer matrices might cause toxic effects [94]. The biocompatibility and the physico-chemical diversity of lipids and their capacity to enhance the oral bioavailability of drugs have made this kind of nanocarriers very attractive systems for drug delivery. As a matter of fact, lipid-based formulations may positively influence drug absorption in several ways, e.g., by influencing the solubilization properties, preventing the drug precipitation upon intestinal dilution, increasing the membrane permeability, inhibiting the efflux transporters, reducing the CYP enzymes, or enhancing the lymphatic transport [94,122]. \n\nAmong the lipid-based nanoparticles, SLNPs have been intensively developed because they combine the advantages of different carrier systems like liposomes and polymeric particles. Similarly to liposomes, SLNPs are composed of physiologically-biocompatible excipients (lipids and fatty acids). In the same way to polymeric NPs, their solid matrix core can efficiently protect the loaded active pharmaceutical ingredient against chemical degradation under the harsh conditions of biological milieux. Therefore, SLNPs provide controlled release profiles of the encapsulated drugs [95]. \n\nIn addition to the above advantages, liposomes can encapsulate and transport both lipophilic and hydrophilic drugs. They have a high degree of similarity to cell membranes in terms of lipid composition and organization, which facilitates the bioavailability of the pharmaceutical compounds [102]. Liquid crystalline nanocarriers (LCN) such as cubosomes and hexosomes (Figure 3) involve multiple compartments for encapsulation of either lipophilic or hydrophilic drugs. They display structural advantages which enable high encapsulation efficacy for molecules of various sizes and hydrophilicity [113,116].",

            "text": "The growing field of nanoscale delivery systems for therapeutics is the main focus of basic research [59]. Nanocarriers for drug delivery may provide a more favorable halflife, a better-controlled release, and a precise localization [60][61][62]. Based on the material that is used, there are three categories of nanocarriers: organic-based, inorganic-based, or a combination of both. The organic nanocarriers include polymeric frameworks and lipid-based systems. Drug conjugates and micelles belong to the polymeric framework, while liposomes, nanoemulsions, and dendrimers are lipid-based systems. The metallic structures, silica nanoparticles, and quantum dots consist of inorganic nanocarriers [63]. Among the nanocarriers, the lipid-based nanoparticle is the leader in terms of higher levels of biocompatibility and flexibility. The potential advantages and short-comings of the lipid-based nanocarriers have been listed in Table 1. The lipid nanoparticles (e.g., solid lipid nanoparticles, SLC) are the pioneer of this rapidly evolving field. There is a long list of attributes and advantages of lipid-based drug delivery systems such as controlled and targeted drug release, pharmaceutical stability, capability for incorporation of both lipophilic and hydrophilic drugs, biodegradability and biocompatibility, low-risk profile, better drug absorption, and lowering the therapeutic dose, etc. The structural modifications of lipid-based nanoparticles enable the delivery carrier to safely and effectively pass through the BBB [64]. Vehicle-based, emulsion-based, or particulate systems are the main lipid nanoparticle drug delivery tools in clinical use [63]. Lipid nanoparticles can satisfy different requirements based on the disease condition, route of administration, product stability, toxicity, and bioavailability. In addition, lipid nanoparticles also have the potential to achieve the goal of controlled and site-specific drug delivery.",

            "text": "However, the clinical implementation of polymeric NPs remains limited, as there are still concerns regarding their safety profile. Preclinical studies have provided evidences that the use of LPHNPs can offer the potential to integrate the advantages of both lipid-and polymeric-based systems in the same platform and overcome the major limitations of polymeric NPs related mostly with toxicity concerns. Indeed, the introduction of an outer layer lipid shell could consent to modulate properties like hydrophobicity, stimuli-triggered drug release, targeting efficiency and polymer chargeassociated toxicity. However, the implementation of large-scale production procedures and the selection of materials with a good biocompatibility represent the major obstacles for their introduction into the clinic. For instance, there is a need for a proper selection of solvent to be utilized during synthesis, as this can significantly affect the stability of the NPs and its inefficient removal may induce undesired toxicity issues. \n\nOnce challenges related with the scale-up of the manufacturing procedures are addressed, more exhaustive studies both in preclinical and clinical settings are needed to allow the full exploitation of LPHNPs in cancer treatment. Guo et al have recently showed that nanoparticles' rigidity is a tunable feature in LPHNPs, which can be opportunely modulated to enhance tumor delivery efficiency by improving their tumor accumulation and uptake by target cells. However, still little is known about the influence of this parameter in defining the interaction of LPHNPs with immune cells and how this aspect can be eventually harnessed to potentiate the effectiveness of cancer immunotherapies [103]. We conclude our review by stating that LPHNPs constitute an intelligent and attractive platform for anticancer therapy since multiple pharmacological action and targeted administration of the therapeutic agent are required in cancer, hence the ability and versatility to be designed as nanosystems of co-delivery opens a new path to the development of personalized and non-invasive nanotherapies with the potential to significantly improve patients' quality of life. Further explorations in the near future will lead to more exciting developments in the application of LPHNPs as nano-platforms for the targeted and safe transport of anticancer therapies.",

            "text": "LNPs are one major category of nanocarriers that are utilized as delivery systems of therapeutic and diagnostic molecules. Their main advantages over other classes include biocompatibility, biodegradability, safety, as well as incorporation and codelivery of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic molecules, with the latter enabling the theranostic concept and addressing the issue of real-time interaction between diagnosis and therapy. Liposomes, niosomes, transfersomes, nanoemulsions, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs), lipid nanocapsules (LNCs), core-shell lipid nanoparticles (CLNs), lipid-based micelles and hybrid systems are representatives of this class of nanoparticles (Figure 1) [7,8]. These nanosystems are considered bioinspired because they mimic natural and physiological components and hold great promise as delivery vehicles for nanotheranostic applications [9]. \n\nThe main ingredients of LNPs are lipids and surfactants, including phospholipids, cholesterol, solid and liquid lipids (fats and oils), as well as non-ionic and other surfactants [10]. In many of these cases, the components self-assemble into the liquid crystalline phase, which presents complex dynamics and metastable phases that are critical to the functionality of the systems [11,12]. LNPs can also contain lipids and materials with distinct structures and physicochemical characteristics, which lead to specific self-assembly, properties and biomedical applications (Table 1). The most recent well-known example is that of ionizable cationic lipids. These lipids have a pK a below 6.5 and during their development, they are charged, while they are non-charged in physiological pH. This class of lipids has been fully exploited for the development of some the recent COVID-19 vaccines. When mixed with genetic material, such as siRNA or mRNA, they produce complexes with internal hydrophobic and hydrophilic compartments.",

            "text": "The application of nanotechnology continues to provide effective strategies in treating various chronic diseases and improving treatment outcomes. Using nanocarrier systems such as liposomes, micelles, and nanoparticles for pulmonary drug delivery has been proven to be a promising noninvasive treatment strategy for achieving drug deposition and controlled release in the lungs [10] (Figure 1). These systems involve the use of engineered particles with dimensions on the nanometer scale to deliver drugs directly to target cells in the lungs [21]. Nanoparticles have several advantages over conventional drug delivery methods, including improved bioavailability, enhanced targeting, and reduced toxicity [22,23]. Liposomes are spherical vesicles composed of lipid bilayers that can encapsulate both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs [24]. The size, surface charge, and lipid composition of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) can be tailored to enhance drug stability, prolong circulation time, and improve biocompatibility [25]. Furthermore, conjugating small-molecule ligands, peptides [26], or monoclonal antibodies [27] to the surface of an LNP can endow it with targeting ability. For example, folate receptors are often found to be overexpressed on macrophages, which makes folate-coupled LNP a great option for delivering antiinflammatory drugs [28]. There are many factors that can affect the release of cargo carried by LNPs, including temperature, changes in pH values, enzymes, light, etc. Among them, the mechanism of pH change is the most studied, and can cause LNPs to undergo phase transition and achieve higher membrane permeability [29]. \n\nIn addition to LNPs, there are also some other nanoparticles that have their own characteristics (Table 1). Micelles are another kind of nanoparticle consisting of amphiphilic molecules that form a core-shell structure [30]. Their great solubility allows them to easily penetrate the increased alveolar fluid barrier present in chronic inflammatory lung diseases.",

The lipid-based nano-delivery of drug/vaccine is a therapeutic option for the treatment of infectious diseases (e.g., COVID-19, MERS, SARS, and Ebola) due to some advantages, such as low cost, easy preparation, increased bioavailability, cellular permeability, and uptake and stability of drug/vaccine. Moreover, lipid-based nanoparticles are a major platform for the design of multicomponent adjuvant systems. Immunotherapy with lipid adjuvants can add to the effective disease management strategies alone and in combination. Although, the loaded antigen or adjuvant with the nanoparticle and other adjuvants could be more useful than a simple mixture, but its manufacturing is commonly complex and difficult. The design of lipidic delivery system is more complex with adding surface modification and with coatings and/or ligands. The use of synthetic coatings and ligands can influence the biocompatibility, biodistribution, and toxicity of lipid-based formulations and thus it needs an exact assay of the interaction of nanoparticles with tissues or cells. \n\nA balance between efficiency, production cost, and simple manufacturing is required to use lipidic delivery systems for development of effective multicomponent subunit vaccines. Furthermore, for using LNPs in a clinical trial, a better understanding of certain mechanisms and techniques is required including the interaction of lipid vectors and gene expression and the safety and immunogenicity profile of vectors. By overcoming these barriers, efficient delivery of genes will be performed by LNPs for clinical use. For instance, lipid-based delivery systems are potent vehicles to target the mRNA molecules safely to the antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Based on the studies, incorporation of the plasmids into the lipid carriers leads to their delivery through the mucosal surfaces or the transdermal route.",

            "text": "Beyond this obvious advantage, further development of LNP-based PDT agents has resulted in some new strategies in leveraging nanoparticles for PDT. \n\nOne optically active LNP agent was first reported by Lovell et al. (2011) with self-assembling porphyrin-lipid nanoparticles (Porphysomes) that exhibited high biocompatibility, minimal systemic toxicity (up to 1,000 mg/kg in mice), photothermal activation in the intact state and photodynamic activation when dissociated after cell uptake (Guidolin et al., 2021). Other iterations of Porphysomes have demonstrated theranostic capabilities with fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging (Muhanna et al., 2015). These examples show that LNP systems for PDT can not only gives the expected biocompatibility and distribution benefits as with chemotherapeutic payloads but can also present opportunities for unique new applications. Some drawbacks can still exist, however, namely, challenges in synthesis to achieve appropriate characteristics of size, polydispersity and encapsulation efficiency (Hou et al., 2021). Another issue is the tendency for LNP encapsulated PS to self-quench, which is why systems such as Porphysomes are not photodynamically active until dissociated into porphyrin-lipid monomers in vitro or in vivo (Muhanna et al., 2015). \n\nBeyond LNPs, the next most common nanocarrier platform for PSs is polymeric nanoparticles such as poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA). PLGA also has a track record of preclinical and clinical use to carry chemotherapeutic agents, albeit less developed than LNPs (Dinakaran et al., 2023). For the PLGA may have some advantages over LNP for photosensitizer delivery. PLGA is particularly effective at encapsulating strongly hydrophobic drugs such as PSs derived from porphyrins, hypocrellins and pthalocyanates (Kou et al., 2017).",

            "text": "The targeted delivery of therapeutic molecules to specific sites in the body represents an active area of research in the biomedical sciences involving scientists, clinicians and engineers alike. To be successful, drug delivery systems must overcome limitations that normally render a pharmaceutical agent ineffective, such as biological barriers and poor biodistribution to the desired site of action. At present, several delivery platforms have been incorporated into clinically used products, including viral vectors, molecular conjugates, antibody-drug conjugates and nanoparticles. Of those, nanoparticles are a particularly promising delivery platform because of their capacity to load different types of drugs separately or in combination, their minimal immunogenicity and their easily modulated properties through controlled chemical synthesis 1 .\n\nOne application that has received substantial attention recently is the delivery of nucleic acids for therapeutics and vaccines. Most notably, the rapid and successful deployment of the messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna represented a turning point for drug delivery 2,3 . These vaccines rely on lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) as a delivery system to shuttle mRNA past multiple biological barriers that would otherwise prevent efficacy. With over a billion doses of mRNA-LNP vaccines administered globally, LNPs for nucleic acid delivery represent one of the most widely used drug products in history. Additionally, LNPs as delivery platforms have been leveraged in multiple clinical trials for applications such as vaccination, protein replacement therapy, cancer immunotherapy, RNA interference and gene editing 4 . LNPs feature high potency, biocompatibility and the ability to be administered repeatedly, all of which are properties that favour clinical translation 4 . Therefore, it is timely to reflect on the lessons learnt from the successful development of LNPs to help devise design criteria for new clinically translatable nanoparticles based on LNPs and related materials. Polymers represent another class of materials with emerging utility for nucleic acid delivery. Multiple biomedical products, such as controlled release depots and absorbable sutures, already incorporate polymers, laying a foundation for successful clinical translation, and their properties can be controlled using chemical synthesis to produce efficacious delivery systems 5,6 . Collectively, lipid and polymer nanoparticles represent the largest",

            "text": "In recent years, nanotechnology has emerged as an efficient tool to circumvent the drawbacks of conventional drug delivery systems. Nanocarriers can modify the basic properties and bioactivity of their encapsulated moieties for improved pharmacokinetic and biodistribution profiles, reduced toxicity, controlled release, enhanced solubility and stability, and site-specific delivery of their payload [10,11]. Furthermore, nanocarriers can be made to have a wide range of physicochemical characteristics by altering their composition, shape, size, and surface properties [12,13]. Nanocarriers can generally be categorized into organic and inorganic systems. The organic nanocarriers include liposomes, lipid nanoparticles, polymeric nanoparticles, dendrimers, micelles, and virus-like particles (VLPs), whereas inorganic nanocarriers include mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) and metallic nanoparticles [14]. Liposomes are spherical vesicles consisting of an aqueous phase enclosed by lipid bilayers of natural or synthetic phospholipids and cholesterol. They may vary in their physical and chemical properties depending on the composition and method of preparation. Liposomes act as suitable carriers for biopharmaceutical delivery due to their safety, versatile characteristics, and easy surface modifications [15,16]. Lipid nanoparticles are composed of triglycerides, partial glycerides, fatty acids, and waxes along with different surfactant combinations. The particle size of lipid nanoparticles is generally below 1 \u00b5m and demonstrates efficient and targeted drug delivery [17,18]. In polymeric nanoparticles, biocompatible and nontoxic natural or synthetic polymers are utilized to synthesize nanosized carriers. They contain either vesicular (nanocapsules) or matrix (nanospheres) systems [19]. Polymeric micelles are self-assembled carriers of block copolymers and consist of core-shell structure.",

            "text": "In addition, the cytotoxicity of cationic lipids can not be ignored. To solve this problem, researchers design lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles with better colloidal stability via the combination of a polymeric core and a cationic lipid shell layer [20]. Jansen et al. fabricated lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles (LNPs) composed of DOTAP (1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium propane) and PLGA (poly (DLlactic-co-glycolic acid) containing siRNA against TNF-\u03b1 to reduce the chronic inflammatory conditions of RA. In addition to great TNF-\u03b1 silencing efficiency, LNPs showed better stability than reference lipidoid-based stable nucleic acid particles (SNALPs) [20]. Moreover, the addition of PLGA may provide the nanoparticles with the ability to release cargo in a sustained way due to the outstanding controllable and alterable degradation profile of PLGA particles [34]. Song et al. designed a lipidoid-polymer hybrid nanoparticle composed of Pluronic F127 and spermidine-based lipidoid (S14) to deliver siRNA against IL-1\u03b2 efficiently. The carriers could lower the expression of IL-1\u03b2 and effectively attenuate the inflammatory symptoms of arthritis induced by collagen antibody (Figure 1) [21]. Compared with other kinds of nanomaterials, lipid-based nanoparticles possess many unique advantages, including high delivery efficiency, low immunogenicity, good biocompatibility and versatility. However, the limitations, such as low stability, short half-time and toxicity at high concentrations, can not be ignored. Lipid-based nanoparticles have shown promise in preclinical studies and are currently being used in clinical trials for gene therapy. Researchers are working to optimize their stability, delivery efficiency and safety profile to make them more effective in treating diseases. Advancements in nanotechnology and lipid chemistry are expected to lead to the development of more sophisticated lipid-based nanoparticles that can deliver nucleic acids for RA gene therapy with even greater precision and efficiency.",

One reason for this is their high degree of biocompatibility and their reduced risk of producing inflammatory responses due to lipids' status as a natural component of the cell membrane [21]. Another advantage is the ability of liposomal NPs to encapsulate hydrophobic molecules in their lipid bilayer, hydrophilic molecules in their aqueous core, or both simultaneously, giving them compatibility with diverse payloads. Conversely, other lipid-containing NPs incorporate hydrophobic molecules into the lipid construct before mixing with the aqueous phase for NP synthesis [49]. LNPs have been shown to deliver not only small molecules, such as anti-cancer drugs and chemotherapy agents [50,51], but also, more recently, nucleic acids. LNPs encapsulated with siRNA targeting ApoB [52], PCSK9 [53], PLK1 [54], VEGF, and KSP [52] expression are just a few examples, along with those delivering self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) [55] and mRNA [50][51][52][53][54][55]. The enhanced flexibility for payloads of diverse chemical properties also allows opportunities for the co-delivery of molecules, such as a combination of antigenic material with tolerogenic agents (e.g., suppressive cytokines and broad immunosuppressants) [56]. Additionally, other LNPs have been surface-modified with engineered peptides and whole membrane proteins, providing further avenues for their possible use as antigen-specific immune tolerance therapeutics [57]. Finally, a low-shear extrusion manufacturing method can minimize the protein denaturation risk during encapsulation.",

This manuscript details the design and benefits of various LNP systems, including solid lipid\u2013polymer hybrids, which offer controlled release and enhanced drug encapsulation. Despite achievements in reducing tumor size and enhancing survival, challenges such as manufacturing complexity, biocompatibility, and variable clinical outcomes persist. Future directions are aimed at refining targeting capabilities, expanding combinatorial therapies, and integrating advanced manufacturing techniques to tailor treatments to individual patient profiles, thus promising to transform lung cancer therapy through interdisciplinary collaboration and regulatory innovation.",

However, they may also face some clinical concerns such as toxicity of monomers or byproducts and may provoke an immune response in vivo. \n\nSolid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) are both lipid-based nanoparticles used in drug delivery. The former is characterized by a solid matrix that enables controlled drug release, alongside improved stability and cost-effectiveness, while the latter is regarded as a second-generation lipid nanoparticle, consisting of both liquid and solid lipids without any crystalline structure [61]. \n\nNP size significantly affects drug loading and delivery in ocular drug delivery. Smaller NPs generally offer better stability and biodistribution. NPs in the range of 50-400 nm are preferred for ocular drug delivery, with sizes around 200 nm easily absorbed by the cornea and conjunctiva through topical administration. They exhibit improved mucoadhesion, better penetration through ocular barriers, and reduced ocular irritation [42,62]. The surface charge of NPs is essential; cationic NPs tend to stay longer on the ocular surface due to their interaction with negatively charged tissues, while anionic NPs have different characteristics [63].",

The literature describes two classical types of lipid nanoparticles, namely: \n\n\u2022 solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN), so-called \"1st generation\", \u2022 nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC), so-called \"2nd generation\". \n\nSLN and NLC are known to increase the bioavailability of loaded drugs administered by different routes (199,200). In contrast to SLN, the lipid matrix of NLC consists of a mixture of solid and liquid lipids (that melt above 40\u00b0C). The matrix originates a lessordered matrix with the capacity to load a higher drug amount than SLN, preventing its leakage during storage and allowing a more flexible drug release modulation (201). SLN contains only solid lipids in its matrix, offering the capacity to modulate the release profile of loaded drugs. SLN and NLC require surfactants (e.g., poloxamers, tweens) to stabilize the lipid matrices in aqueous dispersion (202,203). Acylglycerols, waxes, fatty acids, and hard fats are the most commonly used lipids that should be approved by the Food and Drug Administration (191, 204).",

Nanoparticles, a type of non-viral vector, which are 10-1,000 nm in diameter, have attracted considerable attention in recent years. They have many advantages over other delivery systems, such as lower toxicity, better biocompatibility, higher transfection efficiency, lower cost, and large-scale production (Xin et al., 2017).

            "text": "Nanoparticles are drug delivery systems that are particulate dispersions or solid colloidal particles with diameters ranging between 1 to 1000 nm [100]. These nanocarriers are usually developed from polymers, lipids/proteins, metals and carbon-based materials. Examples of polymers that are used for the formulation of polymer-based nanoparticles include poly (d,l-lactic acid), poly (d,l-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), polyaspartamide, polyalkylcyanoacrylates, etc. [101]. The unique properties of polymers which make them useful in drug delivery are their good compatibility and biodegradability with high stability in a biological environment [102]. Their unique properties are due to factors such as their chemical structure, the type of the functional groups in the molecule, the degree of polymerization, the method of synthesis etc. [103,104]. Drugs are loaded to polymers by encapsulation or immobilization on the polymer for drug release at the target sites [105]. The unique characteristic of the polymer-based nanoparticle is their controlled release mechanism of the loaded therapeutic agents. \n\nMetal-based nanoparticles can be prepared from zinc oxide, iron oxide and other metallic oxides [106]. They are prepared from metals precursors. They exhibit good optoelectrical properties due to localized surface plasmon resonance characteristics. Some of them exhibit a broad absorption in the visible zone of electromagnetic spectrum such as alkali and noble metal nanoparticles. Their advanced optoelectrical properties make them suitable for diagnostic application and targeted drug delivery [107]. \n\nLipid nanoparticles are biodegradable in the biological environment with low toxicity when compared to the polymeric nanoparticles [106]. Lipid nanoparticles are biocompatible because their conformation resembles plasma membrane lipids and human cholesterol. Examples of lipid nanoparticles are liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles and nanoemulsions. Liposomes are composed of a lipid bilayer made of anionic, cationic, or neutral phospholipids and cholesterol.",

The drawbacks of using this system are low drug loading, difficulty in obtaining uniform particle dispersion, toxicity, and drug expulsion during storage. 46 Recent advancements in this system, such as nanostructured lipid carriers, lipid-drug conjugates, and hybrid lipid polymer nanoparticles, are strategies to overcome the limitations of solid lipid nanoparticles. \n\nNanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) are an effective alternative to solid lipid nanoparticles. They comprise a lipid core comprising both liquid and solid lipids (Fig. 2). The presence of both lipids leads to a less perfect crystalline structure with more defects/spaces for drug loading. 47 Polymeric nanoparticles are nanosized colloidal systems of polymeric materials with drugs entrapped in the core (nanocapsule) or the polymer matrix (nanosphere). Biocompatible and biodegradable natural or synthetic polymers are employed to formulate polymer nanoparticles. Polymeric nanoparticles have higher storage stability, higher circulation half-life in the biological system, and a bettercontrolled release profile. 48 The lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticle is an emerging type of lipid nanoparticle, a blend of polymer and lipid nanoparticles. The polymeric core is surrounded by a phospholipid layer coated with a lipid-PEG shell 49 (Fig. 2). A system's mixture of lipid and polymer results in higher mechanical strength, biocompatibility, high payload for both hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs and controlled drug release. 50 bilayers. Based on the number and size of the bilayer, liposomes can be classified into small or large unilamellar or multilamellar liposomes. 51 Liposomal drug delivery systems show biocompatibility and biodegradability properties.

            "text": "NPs, as a strong adjuvant, enhance protection through synergistic effects since they allow for the generation of cocktail vaccines in a single particle and for the delivery of numerous nucleic acids to the same target cell [62]. There has been new research into liposomal, polymeric, inorganic, lipidoid, and peptide-based nanoparticles, with a wide range of different 3D structures, sizes, and modifications, all aimed at increasing the effectiveness of nucleic acid delivery. The recent systems for mRNA vaccine delivery are liposome nanoparticles (LNP), which are lipid bilayer-coated artificial vesicles. Cationic lipids bind to negatively charged nucleic acids through their positive-charged hydrophilic heads, and the hydrophobic lipid tails encapsulate them. On the other hand, neutral lipids can be used to improve transfection efficiency and stability. The quantity of charged groups per molecule, geometric shape, and type of the lipid anchor are all important factors in transfection efficiency [62]. The LNP-encapsulated saRNAs induce higher antibody titers, pathogen neutralization (IC50), and antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses than electroporated pDNA [62]. Recently, the combination of LNPs with dendritic cell (DC) targeting, UTR optimization, lipopolymer design, and ionizable lipids has advanced the field of saRNA vaccination. However, there are concerns about the toxicity of cationic LNPs, caused by membrane disruption, as well as endosomal escapes that interact with LNPs. \n\nPolymeric nanoparticles (PNPs) that are also used for mRNA vaccine delivery are typically made from biocompatible and biodegradable polymers. They have a wide range of physicochemical properties, which may be structurally modified for regulated release of the gene contents [62]. Cationic polymers encapsulate mRNA via electrostatic interactions to generate polymer-mRNA polyplexes. Polyamidoamine dendrimers (PAMAM) and polyethylenimine (PEI) are two commonly used polymers. PNPs preserve mRNAs and also facilitate their entrance into cells.",

A compound nanoparticle drug delivery system in interaction with lymph nodes is shown in Fig. 1. \n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration alludes to nanomaterials as materials with particles in the range of 1 to 100 with properties different from the bulk material [4,5]. Nanofibers, nanoplates, nanowires, quantum dots, and other related materials have been characterized [6]. Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) are a type of lipid nanoparticles (LN), which can be constructed by utilizing solid lipids [7]. Subsequent versions of SLNs have been developed such as nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs), which represent the second era of LN [8]. Both SLN and NLC are built from solid lipids. The interior structure of SLN contains solid lipids, while NLC is developed utilizing a mixture of solid and liquid lipids, which produce precious stone cross section [9,10]. These flaws have additionally been reported for SLNs in light of the fact that SLNs that contain many solid lipid segments can be used in medical applications [11,12]. Polymeric nanoparticles (PN) can be built from natural polymers or inorganic materials, for example, silica [13]. The polymers or lipids shape the core of NPs, which improve stability and drug delivery and offer uniform shape and size [14]. \n\nPN can be described as nanocapsules or nanospheres. The nanocapsules contain oil in a vesicular structure along with a drug [15,16], while nanospheres contain polymeric chains without oil [17,18]. A drug is packed in PNs through blending with the polymer. The incorporation of the drug is ensured in the nanoparticles at the time of polymerization. PNs are loaded with a drug by dissolving, scattering, or artificially adsorbing it in the constituents of the polymer network [19,20].",

            "text": "The 1970s brought the development of polymer NPs, which are more stable than liposomes and can be developed in similar ways. Additionally, polymer nanoparticle-controlled release characteristics are simpler to manage, and surface modification is practical [141]. Nanospheres and nano microcapsules are the two main kinds of polymer NPs. Despite nanospheres, which are \"matrix type,\" in which drugs are distributed throughout the matrix, microcapsules are \"repository type,\" in which medication drugs are present in a core encompassing by a shell of polymer. Due to their excellent biocompatibility, biodegradable nanoparticles have recently demonstrated tremendous potential as medication carriers as shown in Table 7. Although polymer NPs have a low rate of encapsulation, their large molecular weight makes them capable of quickly inducing an immunological response. Lipid polymer hybrid nanoparticles (LPNs) are a new carrier system that has been developed to address these drawbacks. It is obvious that the polymer regulates medication release and the lipid improves loading effectiveness and penetration. Consequently, LPNs have a significant chance of improving physical stability and biocompatibility. Several thrombolytic medicines are delivered orally for which the LPNs system has been investigated. In earlier investigations, chitosan and lipid nanoparticles were found to increase the oral bioavailability of heparin [142]. According to Khan, cisplatin-loaded lipid-polymer hybrid NPs are a promising platform for regulated cisplatin delivery in cancer therapy since they are an efficient delivery method for medication distribution at tumor locations [143].",

            "text": "Among the lipid-based nanoparticles, SLNPs have been intensively developed because they combine the advantages of different carrier systems like liposomes and polymeric particles. Similarly to liposomes, SLNPs are composed of physiologically-biocompatible excipients (lipids and fatty acids). In the same way to polymeric NPs, their solid matrix core can efficiently protect the loaded active pharmaceutical ingredient against chemical degradation under the harsh conditions of biological milieux. Therefore, SLNPs provide controlled release profiles of the encapsulated drugs [95]. \n\nIn addition to the above advantages, liposomes can encapsulate and transport both lipophilic and hydrophilic drugs. They have a high degree of similarity to cell membranes in terms of lipid composition and organization, which facilitates the bioavailability of the pharmaceutical compounds [102]. Liquid crystalline nanocarriers (LCN) such as cubosomes and hexosomes (Figure 3) involve multiple compartments for encapsulation of either lipophilic or hydrophilic drugs. They display structural advantages which enable high encapsulation efficacy for molecules of various sizes and hydrophilicity [113,116]. LCNs are formed by self-assembly of lyotropic lipids such as unsaturated monoglycerides, phospholipids, glycolipids, and other amphiphilic molecules. For example, monoolein, which is a nontoxic, biodegradable, and biocompatible lipid, is classified as a GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe), and \u03c9-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) have been shown to be highly beneficial in various disease models of neurodegeneration [123,124]. \n\nIn the following section, we summarize recently reported works on curcumin delivery to in vitro and in vivo models of neurodegenerative diseases. Lipid-based nanoparticles have the advantage of being the least toxic carriers for in vivo applications. The lipids used to prepare biocompatible and biodegradable nanoparticles are usually naturally-occurring molecules with low acute and chronic toxicity.",

            "text": "delivery of nucleic acids into cells makes them superior to other carriers. Since biological membranes and nucleic acids are negatively charged, it is difficult to deliver mRNA across this barrier. LNPs offer an ideal platform for delivering nucleic acid therapies as the ionizable lipids are nearneutrally charged at physiological pH. However, in acidic endosomal compartments (pH-4.5), they become ionized, promoting endosomal escape for effective intracellular delivery [46,47]. Hence, LNPs achieve high encapsulation rate for nucleic acids with improved transfection efficiency. Furthermore, LNPs have relatively low cytotoxicity and immunogenicity compared to liposomes, thus favoring delivery of nucleic acid based therapeutics [48][49][50].\n\nLipids used in formulating these nanoparticles are biocompatible and are well endured by fatty acids, triglycerides, waxes and steroids. In addition, selecting a good combination of emulsifiers could  make the formulation more stable with higher efficiency [52]. In terms of industrial scale up, LNPs offer multiple advantages compared with other carrier systems, such as large scale production using microfluidics or T-junction mixing, stability, and low cost of raw materials [52][53][54]. The most significant parameters in LNPs characterization are particle size, their size distribution, degree of polymorphism, zeta potential, crystallinity, drug loading, drug release and entrapment efficiency [55]. Drug release from LNPs mostly relies on the type of matrix used and the position of drug in the matrix formulation. The ingredients of lipid matrix, manufacturing parameters and surfactant concentrations, such as rate of stirring, temperature etc. can modulate the drug release profile [56]. In a nutshell, the most fundamental rationale of using LNPs, as an alternative to polymeric nanoparticles, is the simplicity of largescale manufacturing and their low toxicity [57,58].",

            "text": "Solid lipid nanoparticles represent another example of nanometric drug carriers proposed to enhance the N2B delivery of therapeutics. Due to their biocompatible and biodegradable lipid composition, they are believed to have a high safety profile, while maintaining high stability and improving the bioavailability of the cargo molecule. Moreover, lipid nanoparticles are thought to have greater stability upon storage and to be cheaper in mass production when compared to polymeric formulations. In addition, they guarantee the controlled release of the transported active molecule. However, the lipid composition must be extensively controlled, since the inclusion of some fatty acids (e.g., phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylethylamine) may determine rapid clearance of these nanosystems from the nasal epithelia [73,81]. When properly formulated, solid lipid nanoparticles can increase nasal retention, thus enhancing brain delivery [73]. For instance, solid lipid nanoparticles have been tested as delivery agents for the antipsychotic drug risperidone upon IN administration. Patel et al. [148] found a 10-fold higher delivery to the brain of this formulation of risperidone when compared to the simple solution, thus confirming the usefulness of this nanosystem in N2B delivery. \n\nThe last few examples of nanometric drug carriers are represented by liposomes and liposome-related vesicular nanosystems. Liposomes are biocompatible and biodegradable drug delivery systems, composed of vesicles made of phospholipid and cholesterol bilayers, which can incorporate both hydrophilic or hydrophobic therapeutic agents that are entrapped in the aqueous core and in the hydrophobic region of the lipid bilayer, respectively. The ease by which these nanocarriers can be functionalized led to the development of several variants of these nanoparticles including transferosomes. The latter are characterized by high flexibility and deformability due to the incorporation of edge activators in their lipidic bilayers [10,73].",

Recently registered clinical trials involving orally administrated nanoparticles showed that the lipid-based nanoparticles account for a large proportion, such as liposomes (NCT03530436, NCT02278822, NCT03719326), nanolipospheres (NCT03877991, NCT01893424), lipid crystal nanoparticles (NCT02971007, NCT02629419), and phospholipid nanoemulsions (NCT05742022).

When selecting nanocarriers for drug delivery systems, organic materials with good biocompatibility are preferred. Among them, lipid-based materials are particularly favored due to their advantages of easy availability, large-scale production capability, and good safety profile. Additionally, the clinical translation of nanoparticles will be greatly limited by the requirement for excessive additional materials or more complex manufacturing processes to achieve the ideal surface and holistic properties (such as charge, hydrophilicity, particle size, and rigidity). Therefore, it is crucial to take into account the design of The hard NPs with higher rigidity tended to be transported through exocytosis-related pathways such as the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, microtubules, and caveolae, thus showing higher exocytosis efficiency 174",

LNPs have been instrumental in delivering groundbreaking therapeutics, such as the approval of Patisiran (siRNA-based therapeutic) and their use in the mRNA-based vaccinations during the COVID-19 pandemic (Suzuki and Ishihara, 2021). LNPs generally have a lower risk of immunogenicity compared to viral vectors, while they can carry a relatively larger payload of nucleic acids, and as the recent COVID-19 vaccinations indicated, their production can be scaled up. Not surprisingly, research and development on LNP-based therapeutics for the administration of nucleic acids have accelerated, and several clinical applications are being evaluated (Swetha et al., 2023). In fact, LNPs have been tested in clinical trials for different infectious diseases caused by the zika virus, the Chikungunya virus, and influenza (Han et al., 2023). The following sections also list clinical trials indicating which LNPs have been the cornerstone of this approach. \n\nThe versatility of LNPs, their ability to efficiently deliver various types of nucleic acids, and their biocompatibility make them a promising platform for advancing therapeutic interventions in genetic diseases, cancer, infectious diseases, and beyond (Jung et al., 2022;Pilkington et al., 2021). Finally, significant research is being conducted on developing ionizable lipids, which are major components for the LNP-based formulations and their potential. These molecules promote nucleic acid complexation and endosomal escape, and the synthesis of novel molecules with improved properties for transfection while minimizing toxicity compared to permanently charged cationic lipids has been a proliferative area of research (Swetha et al., 2023).",

            "text": "The safety profile of lipid-mRNA nanoparticle formulations correlates with the lipid components and mRNA molecules. Lipid components can activate host immune responses, after systemic or local administration. For example, LNPs with PEGs (as is the case with anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines) can induce hypersensitivity reactions, by stimulating the complement system [132,133]. In addition, anti-PEG antibodies could cause rapid systemic clearance of PEGylated nanoparticles subsequently administered, through an accelerated blood clearance phenomenon, which can alter the bioavailability and biodistribution of the drug encapsulated in these nanoparticles and, thus, cause undesirable effects [132,133]. To mitigate safety concerns, many natural and synthetic polymers have been studied as alternatives to PEG, several of which being evaluated in clinical trials [131,132]. Cationic and ionizable lipids have also been reported to stimulate the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species [134,135]. Although immunogenicity of these lipids is not yet fully understood, system of complement and Toll-Like receptors may participate in innate immune activation. Cytotoxicity of lipid materials also poses safety concerns depending on dose, lipid properties and cell types [135,136]. In vivo application of lipid nanoparticles has been reported to induce liver and lung damage in rodents, which may relate to cytotoxicity of the materials and induction of pro-inflammatory factors. To improve the biocompatibility of LNPs, biodegradable lipids can be used. 6.5. Conditional Marketing Authorization for the Pfizer/BioNtech \u00ae Vaccine [137] Synthetic mRNAs encapsulated in LNPs can reach many organs, such as the spleen, heart, kidneys, lungs and brain. The mRNAs were found in the ovaries and the testicles in small quantities, during the biodistribution studies of this vaccine after 9 days, which implies that endocytosis is not as rapid as supposed.",

Since the beginning of 1990s, the SLNs have been focused on an alternative to polymeric nanoparticles. The advantages of drug release from SLNs in the lung are control of the release profile, achievement of a prolonged release and having a faster in vivo degradation compared to particles made from PLA or PLGA. In addition, SLNs proved to possess a higher tolerability in the lungs compared to particles made from some polymeric materials. The basic theory of nano-technology applied in medicine and the preparation of nano-drugs are still incomplete, especially the safety of nano-medicines has many problems remain to be explored in depth. Therefore, the research in the field of nano-technology applied in medicine has a great deal of work needs to be done, but the superior capability that nano-drugs owns indicates a very wide range of applications in the clinical disease treatment [53].\n\nThe development of several nano carrier systems (liposomal, solid-lipid nanoparticles, polymeric nanoparticles) offers various potential advantages for respiratory drug delivery with reduced and undesirable side-effects. The application of several nano-carriers for drug delivery particularly in chronic lung diseases. Use of different experimental models currently available (in vitro and/ in vivo) to study the risk assessment of nano-carriers. Although nano-medicine based studies suggests that drug delivery systems for systemic and/or local treatment of diseases are promising, yet further research is warranted to elucidate long-term toxicity, deposition and clearance of nanoparticle especially following repeated administration [54].",

Nevertheless, there is the limited availability of nanotechnology-based drug formulation which is approved by FDA in clinical use. It is a formidable challenge to develop the smarter and better nanoscaled drug delivery systems. Up to now, both lipid-based and polymer-based nanoscaled drug delivery systems have represented two dominant classes of nanoscaled drug delivery systems for anticancer drug delivery and shown promising efficacy for clinical treatment [4][5][6]. Liposome, one of the most investigated lipid-based carriers, is a spherical vesicle composed of lipid material and has been widely used for drug delivery due to improved safety profile, high delivery efficiency, favorable pharmacokinetics, and ease of surface modification [7]. However, their clinical uses by intravenous injection are significantly limited because of the insufficient drug loading, burst drug release, instability, and toxicity. Polymeric nanoparticles (NPs), one of the most investigated polymer-based carriers, have small particle size, ability to load drug of poor solubility and permeability, appropriate physiological stability, well-storage stability, controlled and sustained drug release, and long systemic circulation time [5,8]. In addition, the preparation of polymeric NPs by nanoprecipitation or emulsion is simple and scalable [9]. However, the biocompatibility of the polymeric NPs formed by most synthetic polymers is not as high as the liposomes, especially at the cellular and animal level. Thus, it is necessary to develop a novel and practical drug carrier which can combine the desired advantages and avoid the undesired disadvantages of both the lipid-based and polymer-based carriers for clinical application [10]. \n\nIn recent years, the polymer-lipid hybrid NPs designed to merge the best of both worlds had been reported in several groups. The first was that the polymer-lipid hybrid NPs were prepared via the fusion of the polymeric NPs and liposomes [11].",

            "text": "Nanotechnology for nanomedicine development employs functional materials with appropriate nanoscale organization that can interact with biological systems and induce desired physiological responses while minimizing undesirable side effects [60]. Nanotechnology-based delivery systems can influence drug capacity to cross the biological barriers (e.g., the BBB) and reach the targeted brain regions [58][59][60][61]. Therefore, nanocarriers are promising for the development of personalized medicines for the treatment of neurological disorders [62][63][64][65][66][67]. \n\nLipid-based nanoparticles, including solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNPs), nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC), liposomes and liquid crystalline nanocarriers (LCN), as well as polymer-based nanoparticles (Figure 3), have been developed to overcome the poor solubility, stability, and bioavailability of curcumin, and to promote its utilization as a drug in disease treatments . Lipid-based nanoparticles have the advantage of being the least toxic carriers for in vivo applications. The lipids used to prepare biocompatible and biodegradable nanoparticles are usually naturally-occurring molecules with low acute and chronic toxicity. In the case of polymeric nanoparticles, the in vivo degradation of the polymer matrices might cause toxic effects [94]. The biocompatibility and the physico-chemical diversity of lipids and their capacity to enhance the oral bioavailability of drugs have made this kind of nanocarriers very attractive systems for drug delivery. As a matter of fact, lipid-based formulations may positively influence drug absorption in several ways, e.g., by influencing the solubilization properties, preventing the drug precipitation upon intestinal dilution, increasing the membrane permeability, inhibiting the efflux transporters, reducing the CYP enzymes, or enhancing the lymphatic transport [94,122]. \n\nAmong the lipid-based nanoparticles, SLNPs have been intensively developed because they combine the advantages of different carrier systems like liposomes and polymeric particles.",

            "text": "Lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles were developed to combine the advantages of both polymeric nanoparticles and liposomes. They come in various types, each with specific advantages for different applications. One type is the polymer-core lipid-shell hybrid nanoparticles, which have a partial polymer core covered by a lipid shell. They can hold hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs, making them suitable for anticancer therapeutics by co-delivering drug-resistance inhibitors and chemotherapeutic drugs [186]. Another type is the core-shell hollow lipid-polymer-lipid hybrid nanoparticles, which have a hollow core with cationic lipid layers. They possess the features of both lipoplexes and PLGA nanoparticles. They can efficiently capture anionic drugs, enabling the co-delivery of negatively charged nucleic acids such as siRNAs and small drugs to overcome drug resistance. Lastly, the polymer-caged liposome hybrid nanoparticles have polymer coatings on the surface of liposomes, which enhances stability and controls the drug release profile. Despite the versatility of hybrid nanoparticles, they possess common attributes, including a polymeric core that is both hydrophobic and hydrophilic for drug encapsulation, a biocompatible lipid shell encompassing the polymeric core, and an outer component comprising a lipid-PEG that is enveloped by a lipid layer. This structural design enhances drug loading and steric stabilization, prolongs in vivo circulation time, prevents immune recognition, and enhances active targeting, thereby enabling their potential use in anticancer therapeutics [186,187]. \n\nSeveral studies have demonstrated the feasibility of using lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles for PDAC treatment. Hu et al. successfully created hybrid nanoparticles by conjugating an anti-CEA half-antibody with a lipid-polymer structure. The maleimidethiol coupling reaction was employed to attach the anti-CEA half-antibody to the lipid-PEG end.",

            "text": "In the golden age of pharmaceutical nanocarriers, we are witnessing a maturation stage of the original concepts and ideas. There is no doubt that nanoformulations are extremely valuable tools for drug delivery applications; the current challenge is how to optimize them to ensure that they are safe, effective and scalable, so that they can be manufactured at an industrial level and advance to clinical use. In this context, lipid nanoparticles have gained ground, since they are generally regarded as nontoxic, biocompatible and easy-to-produce formulations. Pharmaceutical applications of lipid nanocarriers are a burgeoning field for the transport and delivery of a diversity of therapeutic agents, from biotechnological products to small drug molecules. This review starts with a brief overview of the characteristics of solid lipid nanoparticles and discusses the relevancy of performing systematic preformulation studies. The main applications, as well as the advantages that this type of nanovehicles offers in certain therapeutic scenarios are discussed. Next, pharmacokinetic aspects are described, such as routes of administration, absorption after oral administration, distribution in the organism (including brain penetration) and elimination processes. Safety and toxicity issues are also addressed. Our work presents an original point of view, addressing the biopharmaceutical aspects of these nanovehicles by means of descriptive statistics of the state-of-the-art of solid lipid nanoparticles research. All the presented results, trends, graphs and discussions are based in a systematic (and reproducible) bibliographic search that considered only original papers in the subject, covering a 7 years range (2013-today), a period that accounts for more than 60% of the total number of publications in the topic in the main bibliographic databases and search engines. Focus was placed on the therapeutic fields of application, absorption and distribution processes and current efforts for the translation into the clinical practice of lipid-based nanoparticles. For this, the currently active clinical trials on lipid nanoparticles were reviewed, with a brief discussion on what achievements or milestones are still to be reached, as a way of understanding the reasons for the scarce number of solid lipid nanoparticles undergoing clinical trials.",

            "text": "The safety profile of carrier/mRNA formulations was closely related to carriers and mRNA molecules. For LNPs, lipid components may activate host immune response by systemic or topical administration. For example, PEG-lipids tended to induce hypersensitivity reactions through stimulating the complement system [97]. Moreover, the production of anti-PEG antibodies would result in fast clearance of PEGylated nanoparticles during the blood circulation. To relieve safety concerns, some natural and synthetic polymers served as alternatives [97]. Additionally, cationic and ionizable lipids had been reported to arouse the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS) [98][99][100]. Moreover, cytotoxicity of carriers also needed attention, and it was reported that the in vivo application of LNPs might cause liver and lung injuries in rodents. Furthermore, the immunogenicity of in vitro transcribed mRNA was also a safety concern, because immune response of in vitro transcribed mRNA may suppress antigen expression and attenuate vaccine efficacy. To minimize the immunogenicity of mRNA, chemical modification of specific in vitro transcribed mRNA nucleotides and chromatographic purification were carried out [101,102].",

            "text": "Another case of synthetic polymers with acceptable biocompatibility is poly(malic acid) (PMLA), a biocompatible amphiphilic polymer based on polyesters. The features of PLMA are water soluble, biodegradable, and less toxic (Loyer and Cammas-Marion, 2014). The pendent carboxyl moieties in PLMA enable the introduction of various chemical modifications for nanoparticle development; these include antibodies, proteins, and specific drugs, including antibiotics (Chi et al., 2016). \n\nLipid-based nanoformulations, such as liposomes, nanoemulsions, and solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), are frequently applied for transporting antibacterial drugs. Lipid nanoparticles can facilely fuse with bacterial membrane, delivering antibiotics directly to bacteria (Furneri et al., 2017). Liposomes, as the carriers for drug delivery, can prolong circulation time and accelerate cellular uptake, thus countering therapeutic resistance; these nano-sized vesicles consist of membrane-like phospholipid bilayers in an aqueous solution (Fenske and Cullis, 2008). Liposomes have gained much attention because of their non-toxicity and structural similarity to cells. Liposomes can fuse with mammalian cells, tumor cells, and microbes, facilitating the transport of drugs across biomembranes (Fang et al., 2014). Lipid nanocarriers, such as solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) and nanoemulsions, appear suitable as drug-carrier systems due to their very low cytotoxicity relative to polymeric nanoparticles (Wen et al., 2011). The predominant difference among SLNs, NLCs and nanoemulsions is the composition of the inner core. SLNs are particles made from crystalline solid lipids, whereas NLCs are composed of a solid lipid matrix with a certain content of a liquid lipid; they are a more advanced generation of SLNs. Nanoemulsions are nanocarriers with neat liquid oil in the inner phase.",

            "text": "Lipid-based systems, including lipoplex, liposomes, and solid lipid nanoparticles, are promising colloidal nanocarriers for bioactive organic molecules, e.g., ONs [278,279]. These systems are known for excellent drug delivery capabilities, attributed to the protective outer layer of lipids that surround the ON cargo [272,278]. Lipoplexes are formed by the direct electrostatic attraction between polyanionic ONs and synthetic cationic lipids [280]. Despite their unstable nature, lipoplex formulations have been effectively utilized for localized delivery applications. Liposomes and LNPs, while similar in design, differ slightly in composition and function [272,278]. LNPs for the delivery of ONs are typically composed of ionizable cationic lipids, phospholipids, PEG, and cholesterol derivatives [279,281]. \n\nLNPs, perhaps the most advanced in terms of clinical translatability for ON delivery, have been demonstrated to possess a high level of efficiency for ON drug delivery and the ability to target specific tissues [272,278,281]. LNPs are able to protect ONs from degradation and increase their circulation half-life, making them a promising option for treating various diseases [278]. Additionally, LNPs have shown a low level of toxicity, further highlighting their potential as a drug delivery system [278,281]. \n\nThe recent approval of patisiran, an siRNA directed against transthyretin mRNA in an LNP system, has renewed interest in LNPs [11,278,279,282,283]. LNPs form polyelectrolyte complexes by facilitating ionic interactions between the positively charged functional groups and the negatively charged phosphate fraction of the ONs [284]. ONs can be encapsulated within the matrix of the LNPs or attached to their surface through covalent or ionic bonding [285,286]. Ionizable lipids are being developed for in vivo applications to avoid toxicity [287]. PEG lipids are often prudently added to the LNPs to stabilize the structure during manufacturing and storage [279,288].",

            "text": "he development of nanotechnology in the field of drug delivery has improved the pharmacokinetics of a number of poorly soluble and poorly permeable drugs. During the past few decades, numerous nanoparticulate drug delivery systems have been approved for clinical use. The various nanocarriers for drug delivery include polymeric nanoparticles, liposomes, micelles, solid lipid nanoparticles, nano-structured lipid carriers, dendrimers, carbon nanotubes, etc. 1 Among them, polymeric nanoparticles and liposomes are the most dominant nanocarriers for drug delivery. Polymeric nanoparticles are the colloidal systems ranging in the nanometric size. They can be composed of either biodegradable or non-biodegradable polymers. The implementation of amphiphilic polymers led to the formation of nanoparticles with hydrophobic core and hydrophilic shell. The polymeric nanoparticles permit higher drug loading and also provides controlled drug release kinetics. They could also be tailored to furnish a variety of surface decorated nanoparticles for enhancing their physicochemical properties. Polymeric nanoparticles can be synthesized by a number of techniques on the basis of the types of drugs to be encapsulated and their application. Several polymeric nanoparticles have been approved for clinical use such as Genexol-PM, a nanoparticulate formulation comprising of paclitaxel and poly (d,l-lactide)-b-polyethylene glycol-methoxy, approved for metastatic breast cancer therapy. On the other hand, liposomes are spherical vesicles composed of lipid bilayer made up of either natural or synthetic amphiphilic lipid molecules. They are extensively employed for drug delivery owing to their ease of fabrication methods, favorable safety profile, amenable to surface modification, and long systemic circulation halflife. Numerous drug loaded liposomal formulations have been approved for clinical use including AmBisome (amphotericin B liposomes), DepoCyt (cytarabine liposomes), DepoDur (morphine liposomes), and DaunoXome (daunorubicin liposomes) 1 .",

At the same time, lipid nanoparticles have also demonstrated enormous potential in delivering nucleic acid drugs as evidenced by the approval of two RNA therapies and mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. In this review, an overview on different classes of lipid nanoparticles, including liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles, and nanostructured lipid carriers, is first provided, followed by the introduction of their preparation methods. Then the characterizations of lipid nanoparticles are briefly reviewed and their applications in encapsulating and delivering hydrophobic drugs, hydrophilic drugs, and RNAs are highlighted. Finally, various applications of lipid nanoparticles for overcoming different delivery challenges, including crossing the blood-brain barrier, targeted delivery, and various routes of administration, are summarized. Lipid nanoparticles as drug delivery systems offer many attractive benefits such as great biocompatibility, ease of preparation, feasibility of scale-up, nontoxicity, and targeted delivery, while current challenges in drug delivery warrant future studies about structure-function correlations, large-scale production, and targeted delivery to realize the full potential of lipid nanoparticles for wider clinical and pharmaceutical applications in future.",

            "text": "Purpose Lipoparticles are the core-shell type lipid-polymer hybrid systems comprising polymeric nanoparticle core enveloped by single or multiple pegylated lipid layers (shell), thereby melding the biomimetic properties of long-circulating vesicles as well as the mechanical advantages of the nanoparticles. The present study was aimed at the development of such an integrated system, combining the photodynamic and chemotherapeutic approaches for the treatment of multidrug-resistant cancers. Methods For this rationale, two different sized Pirarubicin (THP) loaded poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) nanoparticles were prepared by emulsion solvent evaporation technique, whereas liposomes containing Temoporfin (mTHPC) were prepared by lipid film hydration method. Physicochemical and morphological characterizations were done using dynamic light scattering, laser doppler anemometry, atomic force microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The quantitative assessment of cell damage was determined using MTT and reactive oxygen species (ROS) assay. The biocompatibility of the nanoformulations was evaluated with serum stability testing, haemocompatibility as well as acute in vivo toxicity using female albino (BALB/c) mice. Results and Conclusion The mean hydrodynamic diameter of the formulations was found between 108.80 \u00b1 2.10 to 405.70 \u00b1 10.00 nm with the zeta (\u03b6) potential ranging from \u221212.70 \u00b1 1.20 to 5.90 \u00b1 1.10 mV. Based on the physicochemical evaluations, the selected THP nanoparticles were coated with mTHPC liposomes to produce lipid-coated nanoparticles (LCNPs). A significant (p< 0.001) cytotoxicity synergism was evident in LCNPs when irradiated at 652 nm, using an LED device. No incidence of genotoxicity was observed as seen with the comet assay. The LCNPs decreased the generalized in vivo toxicity as compared to the free drugs and was evident from the serum biochemical profile, visceral body index, liver function tests as well as renal function tests",

            "text": "Lipid-polymer nanoparticles are a hybrid delivery system in which a polymer core is encapsulated in a lipid layer [81]. They combine the good biocompatibility and low immunogenicity of lipids with the high affinity of polymers for RNA [148], so they can solve the problems of poor structural stability of lipids and poor biocompatibility of polymers [137]. The polymer core is used for drug loading and the lipid shell helps to impart special surface properties of vectors. For instance, using endogenous phospholipids can not only effectively increase the compatibility of nanoparticles with the lung [204], but also affect the in vivo fate of nanoparticles [205]. Liu et al. [205] modified PLGA NPs with biomimetic endogenous pulmonary surfactant phospholipids, and the results showed that dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), dipalmitoylphosphatidylamine (DPPE), and dipalmitoylphosphatidylglycerol (DPPG) could improve the mucoadhesive ability, while dipalmitoylphosphatidylserine (DPPS) could improve the mucus permeability of PLGA NPs.\n\nThe methods of lipid-polymer nanoparticles preparation include the single-step method and the two-step method. In the single-step method, when polymer-containing organic solutions are added to lipidcontaining aqueous solutions, the polymer precipitates, and then lipids can self-assemble on the polymer core to form a monolayer. In the two- [ 73] step method, the prepared gene-loaded PNPs are directly added to dried lipid films or prepared lipid vesicles, and then HNCs can be formed by vortexing and/or ultrasonication at a temperature above the phase transition temperature of lipids [206]. Gabriella et al. [204] demonstrated that DPPC/PLGA-siRNA hybrid nanoparticles could transfect A549 cells in vitro and produce long-term inhibition of epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) protein expression",

            "text": "Nanoparticles developed from solid lipids are typically spherical, nano-sized (10 to 1,000 nm) colloidal carriers of natural or synthetic lipid-based drug delivery system. It is acclaimed that solid lipid nanoparticles are biocompatible and have a low toxicity profile. In contrast to polymeric or inorganic nanoparticles, lipid-based nanocarriers are less toxic and biocompatible. 45,46 Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) hold a solid core of the lipid matrix that can dissolve the lipophilic molecules. The term lipid is used generally in a vast sense and includes triglycerides, partial glycerides, PEGylated lipids, fatty acids, steroids, and waxes. 47 The lipid core is balanced by using surfactants, as shown in Figure 4. The amount of emulsifier used depends on administration routes and is more limited for parenteral administrations. 48,49 In this drug delivery system, small-sized lipid core, surfactants and drugs are present in appropriate ratios showing some unbeatable properties that make them superior over other existing drug carriers. These SLN-based preparations have some unique characteristics, including high drug loading, and increased drug stability. These formulations have better feasibility of hydrophilic and lipophilic drug incorporation. Generally, SLNs are highly compatible owing to their composition similarity from physiological lipids. Exceptional ability to incorporate drugs into nanocarriers and size-dependent properties of SLN makes them an ideal candidate to develop novel therapeutic prototypes for drug delivery and targeting. SLN has the potential to enhance the efficiency of pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, and other materials. In comparison to phospholipids and biodegradable polymers, solid lipids are economical. [52][53] Applications of SLN In the recent past, SLN has emerged as a novel DDS for cancer research, including drug delivery, 54  targeting. 55,56 SLN, either single-handedly or in conjugation with other molecules, is extensively used in medicines, biomedical applications, bio-imaging, and photo-thermal therapy. 57 Anticancer agents are delivered with improved selectivity, and activity is enhanced when delivered via novel SLNs.",

Novel techniques and scalable production methods are needed to simplify the manufacturing of these targeted nanoparticles, making it feasible to produce them in large quantities for clinical use. \n\nTo enhance the biocompatibility of LNPs, investigating molecular structures that exhibit high biocompatibility is critical when designing ionizable lipids and other components. For instance, zwitterionic materials are known for their excellent compatibility with biological systems. Exploring new strategies for endosomal escape and cytosolic delivery based on organic chemistry is essential for achieving safe and efficient delivery because LNPs can be subject to lysosomal entrapment, where lipid components may degrade and compromise lysosomal membrane integrity, causing cytotoxicity. In recent years, the optimization and exploration of LNPs have involved extensive and complex screening processes, leading to the reporting of thousands of lipids. Establishing a streamlined regulatory framework for managing the vast array of LNPs and lipids plays a crucial role in handling LNP safety concerns. For example, the growing diversity of ionizable lipids, with lots of variants now available, has raised concerns about potential toxicity. Regulatory agencies must oversee these developments, ensuring that the manufacturing processes, component selection, and safety evaluation are standardized and thoroughly monitored.",

            "text": "In the golden age of pharmaceutical nanocarriers, we are witnessing a maturation stage of the original concepts and ideas. There is no doubt that nanoformulations are extremely valuable tools for drug delivery applications; the current challenge is how to optimize them to ensure that they are safe, effective and scalable, so that they can be manufactured at an industrial level and advance to clinical use. In this context, lipid nanoparticles have gained ground, since they are generally regarded as non-toxic, biocompatible and easy-to-produce formulations. Pharmaceutical applications of lipid nanocarriers are a burgeoning field for the transport and delivery of a diversity of therapeutic agents, from biotechnological products to small drug molecules. This review starts with a brief overview of the characteristics of solid lipid nanoparticles and discusses the relevancy of performing systematic preformulation studies. The main applications, as well as the advantages that this type of nanovehicles offers in certain therapeutic scenarios are discussed. Next, pharmacokinetic aspects are described, such as routes of administration, absorption after oral administration, distribution in the organism (including brain penetration) and elimination processes. Safety and toxicity issues are also addressed. Our work presents an original point of view, addressing the biopharmaceutical aspects of these nanovehicles by means of descriptive statistics of the state-of-the-art of solid lipid nanoparticles research. All the presented results, trends, graphs and discussions are based in a systematic (and reproducible) bibliographic search that considered only original papers in the subject, covering a 7 years range (2013-today), a period that accounts for more than 60% of the total number of publications in the topic in the main bibliographic databases and search engines. Focus was placed on the therapeutic fields of application, absorption and distribution processes and current efforts for the translation into the clinical practice of lipid-based nanoparticles. For this, the currently active clinical trials on lipid nanoparticles were reviewed, with a brief discussion on what achievements or milestones are still to be reached, as a way of understanding the reasons for the scarce number of solid lipid nanoparticles undergoing clinical trials.",

Due to their size-dependent properties, lipid nanoparticles offer the possibility to develop new therapeutics that could be used for secondary and tertiary level of drug targeting. Hence, lipid nanoparticles hold great promise for reaching the goal of controlled and site specific drug delivery and has attracted wide attention of researchers.\n\nAt the turn of the millennium, modifications of SLN, nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) and lipid drug conjugate (LDC)-nanoparticles were introduced [2,3] in addition to liquid crystal DDS. These carrier systems overcome observed limitations of conventional SLN and more fluid lipid DDS. Compared to liposomes and emulsions, solid particles possess some advantages, e.g. protection of incorporated active compounds against chemical degradation and more flexibility in modulating the release of the compound. This paper focuses on the different lipid based nano systems, their structure and associated features, stability, production methods, drug incorporation and other issues related to their formulation and use in drug delivery. The following advantages among others, could be ascribed to lipid based nanocarriers:\n\n\u2022 ability to control and target drug release. \u2022 ability to improve stability of pharmaceuticals. \u2022 ability to encapsulate high drug content (compared to other carrier systems e.g. polymeric nanoparticles). \u2022 the feasibility of carrying both lipophilic and hydrophilic drugs. \u2022 most of the lipids used are biodegradable, and as such they have excellent biocompatibility, are non-toxic, non-allergenic and non-irritating. \u2022 they can be formulated by water-based technologies and thus can avoid organic solvents. \u2022 they are easy to scale-up and sterilize. \u2022 they are less expensive than polymeric/surfactant based carriers. \u2022 they are easy to validate.",

            "text": "As mentioned above, both lipid-based and polymer-based nanocarriers present their advantages and disadvantages. Based on the strengths of each nanosystem, lipid-polymer nanoparticles (LPNs) have emerged as hybrid drug-delivery systems that combine the two classes of materials into a hybrid nanocarrier with superior physicochemical and biological proprieties. By structure, LPNs are core-shell nanoparticles consisting of a polymeric core, where the drug cargo is encapsulated, protected by a lipid shell, covered by an optional hydrophilic polymeric stealth layer [188,189]. In this dual architecture, the high structural stability and controlled release of encapsulated drugs specific to polymeric nanoparticles are combined with the excellent biocompatibility of liposomes to design and develop next-generation core-shell nanoparticles. These LPNs show enhanced drug encapsulation efficiency and better control over the drug release profile, features that can be attributed to the protective lipid monolayer that seals the drug cargo into the polymeric core to avoid leakage [190,191]. For example, Wang et al. [121] successfully synthetized, by the solvent-evaporation method, HA-functionalized LPNs for codelivery of plasmid DNA and IRI, which showed good stability and enhanced cytotoxic effects on SW480 cells overexpressing CD44. More, in vivo results revealed that when loaded with plasmid DNA and IRI, HA-LPNs show an increased antitumor and transfection efficiency compared to non-functionalized LPNs, highlighting the remarkable potential of the HA-LPNs to act as targeted nanosystems for drug and gene combination therapy.",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) containing ionizable lipids are the most clinically advanced platform for mRNA delivery, but their application beyond the liver remains challenging. Polymer-lipid hybrid nanoparticles offer a promising alternative, combining the synthetic versatility and unique properties of polymers with the biocompatibility of lipid excipients. While the significance of alkyl tail design is well-recognized for ionizable lipids, the impact of the polymer side chain composition on interactions with lipid excipients, mRNA delivery efficacy, and tissue specificity remains poorly understood. Here, we focus on a class of ionizable amino-polyesters (APEs) that exhibit features desired for potential clinical applications, including narrow molecular weight distribution and a good safety profile, and investigate the effect of polymer side chain composition on the formulation of APE lipid nanoparticles (APE-LNPs) for mRNA delivery. A library of 36 APEs was synthesized via ring-opening polymerization of chemically diverse tertiary amino-alcohols and lactone monomers with distinct alkyl side chain compositions, including variations in length and unsaturation. We show that optimal alkyl side chain length is critical for the assembly of stable mRNA nanoparticles and efficient mRNA delivery both in vitro and in vivo. Top-performing APE-LNPs display superior delivery efficacy in vitro and in extrahepatic tissues compared to benchmark LNPs, including DLin-MC3-DMA ionizable lipid. The polymer chain composition affects the tissue selectivity of APE-LNPs, with shorter side chains (4-5 carbons) effectively targeting the spleen and lungs, while longer chains (7-9 carbons) show enhanced liver delivery. We also explored the relevance of lipid excipients in APE-LNPs, demonstrating the essential role of unsaturated phospholipids in enhancing cellular uptake and mRNA delivery, and the limited relevance of cholesterol. These findings provide valuable insights into the design of polymers for use in the LNP context, which could aid the development of polymeric alternatives to ionizable lipids and expand the utility of mRNA LNP technology to nonliver tissues.",

            "text": "In order to further improve the therapeutic index of siRNA-LNP, its biodegradable version, L319, was develop by adding ester bonds to the hydrophobic dialkyl chains, which enables the rapid elimination of siRNA-LNPs in the liver [83]. ATX lipids (Arcturus) were also designed to contain an ionizable amino head group and a biodegradable lipid backbone, which can degrade and scavenge in the liver much faster than Dlin-MC3-DMA [84]. Embedding biodegradable linker fragments in lipids may improve their biocompatibility and further promote their elimination in vivo [83]. Therefore, it is important to develop new next-generation lipids with a superior potency and biodegradable functions to further promote the development of the LNP platform. \n\nThe main advantages of LNPs as DDSs include the tailored optimization of biophysical and biological characteristics to achieve efficient encapsulation and controlled release. The current review focused on the research overview of LNPs as a mRNA DDS. In addition to the LNPs previously mentioned, other types of lipid-based mRNA DDSs include hybrid biopolymers, lipoplexes (LPXs), lipopolyplexes (LPPs), and nanocapsules (LNCs). Recently, lipid polymer hybrid nanoparticles (LPNs) have served as promising biomaterials for RNA delivery that integrate the physicochemical properties of both lipids and the polymers. The LPN can effectively protect and deliver mRNA to achieve the correct expression of the corresponding protein. A study has shown that poly\u03b2-amino lipids (PBAEs) were coated with phospholipid bilayers, and then the mRNA was loaded onto the surface of the nanoparticles by an electrostatic interaction to deliver mRNA vaccines through nasal mucosa [85]. The results indicate that the LPN/mRNA complex is readily taken up by dendritic cells (DC S ) and can deliver mRNA into the cytoplasm of DCs to reduce toxicity [85].",

In the lncRNA field, LNPs have also achieved ideal results in animal models. The ASO-Au-TAT NPs targeting MALAT1 inhibited cancer metastasis, and the RGD-PEG-ECO/siDANCR nanoparticles could suppress tumor progression [230,238]. Moreover, endogenous exosomes were developed to achieve a lower immunogenicity and better biocompatibility [239].

            "text": "Lipid-based nanoparticles, which are typically spherical in shape and contain a lipid bilayer that encapsulates aqueous compartments, provide several benefits as a drug delivery system. These benefits include the ability to transport substantial payloads, biocompatibility, excellent bioavailability, and the simplicity of formulation [40]. As a result, lipid-based NPs have emerged as the predominant class of FDA-approved nanomedicines, owing to their versatility and efficacy [41]. Among the various subsets of lipid-based nanocarriers, liposomes are particularly prominent. Liposomes are typically composed of phospholipids, enabling the formation of unilamellar or multilamellar vesicular structures. This unique property of liposomes enables them to efficiently carry and deliver a wide range of drugs, including hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds. Different things can affect how stable liposomes are, both in the lab and in living things. These include the size of the nanoparticles, their surface charge, the type of lipids they contain, the number of lamellae they have, and any changes to their surface that involve ligands or polymers [42,43]. To stop the reticuloendothelial system from taking them up quickly, liposomes are often modified on the outside to make them last longer in the bloodstream and carry drugs better. These modifications have played a crucial role in facilitating the clinical utilization of liposomes. The nanodispersions made up of uniformly dispersed nanoparticles in a liquid media, with sizes ranging from 1 to 100 nm. Moreover, the surface area increases with decrease in particle size, which improves the rate of breakdown and absorption of the dispersed materials. In pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and culinary goods, these dispersions are frequently employed to increase the solubility, stability, and bioavailability of active substances [44]. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a notable subgroup within lipid-based NPs that are extensively employed for nucleic acid delivery, offering improved stability, protection, and targeted delivery capabilities.",

In addition, LNPs are lipid-based spherical vesicles and can self-assemble into precise structures like cell membranes. 164 Furthermore, LNPs are lipid-based, and nanoscale carriers that can effectively transfer mRNA intracellularly and safeguard it from RNAase during systemic circulation. 165 7][168][169] (Figure 2) \n\nModifying the lipid structure 130 and particle surface has been regarded as a strategy to increase the efficient delivery of mRNA into the cytosol. 14,170 It was discovered that LNPs having multilamellar, faceted, and lamellar lipid phases have better mRNA transfection effectiveness. 171,172 N-[1-(2,3-dioleyloxy) propyl]-N,N,N trimethylammonium chloride (DOTMA), for example, was a first-generation permanently charged lipid that was toxic, 173 subpar, and relied on nonscalable methods. At an acidic pH (where the amino lipids were positively charged), in the presence of ethanol, ionizable amino lipids were employed to create nucleic acids. 174,175 minently, LNP delivery materials are employed in the existing mRNA vaccines approved by FDA. 57,176 The numerous advantages of lipid-nanoparticle-based mRNA delivery systems, such as their high stability, transfection efficiency, efficacy, safety, and low-cost production techniques, have facilitated the rapid development of mRNA vaccines and medicines, providing a powerful disease-fighting tool. 177",

            "text": "Haifa Shen from Stemirna Therapeutics developed a lipopolyplex nano-delivery platform (LPP) with polymer-encapsulated mRNA as the core and a phospholipid-encapsulated bilayer structure. They claimed that the bilayer nanoparticles of the LPP provided better mRNA encapsulation and progressive release of mRNA molecules with polymer degradation as well as excellent dendritic cell targeting for better activation of T-cell immune responses through antigen presentation [41]. Using the SW-BIC-213 delivery platform, a new COVID-19 vaccine has been developed and is currently in phase I trials [42]. Furthermore, to enhance the stability of mRNA, Jacob A. Poliskey et al. utilized a PEGylated polyacridine peptide to bind double-stranded mRNA (dsmRNA) to generate dsmRNA polyplexes that were metabolically stable in the circulation. In addition, Yoshinaga et al. complexed mRNA with derived poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(cationic) block copolymers with phenylboronic acid and polyol groups to obtain polycomposite micelles (PM) with ATP-responsive cross-linked mRNA loading in the inner core to prevent enzymatic degradation [43,44]. \n\nCompared to conventional cationic polymeric carriers, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) made with ionizable lipids have shown many advantages: good biocompatibility, high nucleic acid encapsulation and effective transfection, high tissue penetration for delivery of therapeutic agents, intelligent drug release, low off-target effects, and low cytotoxicity and immunogenicity. Hence, LNPs have become the most studied and widely used third-generation mRNA delivery system [45,46], which has greatly contributed to the development of the mRNA industry and clinical applications such as the application of LNP-assisted mRNA delivery for potent cancer immunotherapy [47]. As shown in Table 3, for nucleic acid drugs, LNPs have more advantages than other delivery systems in terms of the encapsulation effect, expression efficiency, and safety in vitro and vivo.",

            "text": "Nanoparticle-based delivery systems are at the cutting edge of siRNA therapeutic advancements, providing innovative solutions to overcome challenges associated with stability, bioavailability, targeted delivery, and biological barriers. These platforms safeguard siRNA from enzymatic degradation, enhance delivery efficiency, and enable tumor-specific targeting. However, each system has inherent trade-offs related to safety, biocompatibility, and efficiency. Here, key nanoparticle technologies and their advancements and limitations in, and their role in, optimizing siRNA delivery are highlighted [20,21]. \n\nProbably the most common utilized delivery nanosystem, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have emerged as the most clinically advanced vehicles for siRNA delivery, with their success exemplified by FDA-approved therapies such as patisiran [47,48]. LNPs typically consist of ionizable lipids, phospholipids, cholesterol, and PEG-lipids, forming a highly stable delivery system that enables effective siRNA encapsulation and endosomal escape. Recent advancements have introduced ionizable lipids with optimized pKa values to enhance endosomal release and minimize cytotoxicity. However, challenges remain regarding potential immune activation and off-target effects. Strategies such as PEGylation or lipid chemical modifications have been employed to reduce immunogenicity and extend circulation time [47,48]. As an alternative to LNPs, polymeric nanoparticles, including biodegradable polymers such as poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and chitosan, provide a versatile platform for siRNA delivery. These systems offer controlled release profiles and high loading capacities. Innovations such as functionalized polymers with tumor-specific ligands (e.g., folic acid or RGD peptides) have enhanced selective tumor uptake. However, their immunogenic potential and potential for incomplete degradation in vivo are areas of active research to ensure safety and biocompatibility [47,48]. \n\nGold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have gathered attention due to their tunable size, ease of functionalization, and inherent biocompatibility.",

            "text": "The last decade has seen interesting developments in the field of lipid-polymer hybrid nanotechnology. There has been an exponential increase in the number of studies performed using these hybrid systems, with a dazzling array of surface coatings and encapsulated cargoes. Not only have these LPNs been used to deliver therapeutic molecules such as small molecules, plasmids, siRNA, proteins and peptides, they have also been used to deliver diagnostic molecules such as iron oxide nanoparticles, fluorescent dyes, quantum dots and gold nanoparticles. These systems have been tested in both in vitro and in vivo models. \n\nAlthough LPNs encompass the advantages of both polymeric nanoparticles and liposomes, they present new challenges that may impede clinical translation. For example, a multi-step synthesis process is required due to the use of two classes of biomaterials (lipids and polymers), which may make scale-up manufacturing more challenging. There are also additional economic and quality considerations when produ-cing the LPNs on a large scale. Researchers need to define all of the component ingredients at a molecular level, and evaluate their safety and biocompatibility in vivo. Thus, the development of simple and scalable protocols for the synthesis of LPNs, using FDA-approved materials with highly predictable in vivo characteristics, will enable faster clinical translation. \n\nAlthough LPNs present a number of advantages in that they can deliver both hydrophobic and hydrophilic cargo and also be functionalized for active targeting, more studies need to be done at the pre-clinical stage. For example, the majority of cancer therapeutic studies reported in the literature using LPNs have only been tested in in vitro models. More investigational new drug (IND) type studies focusing on in vivo antitumor efficacy, biodistribution, clearance and long-term toxicity will need to be performed. \n\nApart from IND studies, there are also several interesting novel techniques that could be explored further. One such example is the recent development of 'cell ghosts', which are LPN-like nanoparticles that use biologically derived lipid membranes isolated from cells in place of synthetic lipids. 87 Such nanoparticles may have unique biological functionalities depending upon the cell type chosen and hold immense potential for cancer treatment.",

We emphasize that the penetration efficiency of the NPs is an important parameter as the therapeutic efficiency could be limited when the drug is only delivered to the outermost cells of the tumor. 7,8 Whilst it is well established that NP penetration depends on the physicochemical properties of the NPs, e.g., size, 9\u221212 a detailed head-to-head comparison of the penetration of a broad selection of lipid-based NPs is still wanted to learn which kind of lipid-based NPs to use for a certain drug candidate. Hence, this study provides a comparative investigation of the penetration efficiencies of liposomes (Lip), PEGylated liposomes (PEG-Lip), reconstituted high-density lipoproteins (rHDL), and lipoplexes (LPX), which have all reached clinical trials. 2,13,14 As a non-lipid control, we used polystyrene nanoparticles (PNP) (Figure 1). Briefly, liposomes (Lip and PEG-Lip) are some of the most commonly used drug carriers. They are spherical vesicles comprising a lipid bilayer and an aqueous core, while surface grafting of polyethylene glycol (PEG) is frequently used to increase their blood circulation time. 2,15,16 LPX are complexes of nucleic acids that are stabilized by cationic lipids 13 and are usually used for genetargeting applications. 2",

            "text": "Biodegradable and nonbiodegradable are two major categories of organic NPs. Biodegradable NPs include lipid-based NPs (LNP) and polymer-based NPs, while non-biodegradable NPs consist of carbon NPs [37] . Drug molecules, nucleic acids, antibodies, and specialized targeted moieties can be efficiently delivered using liposomes and numerous polymers. Stimuli-sensitive nanoparticulate systems have gained much popularity in the treatment of liver fibrosis. Organic nanoparticles have an edge in terms of better encapsulation efficiency and a high loading capacity, along with good biocompatibility, increased bioavailability, and decreased systemic side effects and toxicity. They are considered the primary choice in the therapy of cirrhosis when a sustainable site-specific delivery system has to be developed. LNP has established itself as an emerging field for treating liver fibrosis. LNPs mainly consist of stable nucleic acid LNPs (SNALPs), liposomes, and solid lipid NPs (SLNs) [23] . LNPs are non-viral vectors used not only for therapeutic agent delivery but have also emerged in gene delivery owing to their ease of formulation and high versatility. Simple surface modification properties enable targeted drug delivery in LNPs. Their composition, particle size, and surface characteristics help in the evaluation of in vivo studies. Liposomes are one of the major LNPs, and there is a growing research interest in both preclinical and clinical stages for sitespecific delivery in liver fibrosis. They are potent carriers, and liposome-based delivery is considered the best amongst its peers for carrier-mediated delivery in liver fibrosis. Prominent properties include entrapment of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs, bioavailability, biocompatibility, and low toxicity. This in contrast comes at a high price for production, low solubility, and chances of having a leakage, which hinders its further development [23] .",

            "text": "The optimum drug conjugated nanosystem is selected based on the drug encapsulation efficiency and biochemical features of the targeted medications chosen for therapy [11]. However, nanocarrier toxicity must be addressed when contemplating the application of nanomedicine [12]. Biodegradable polymeric nanoparticles and liposomes are the two emerging popular categories of drug nanocarriers, as indicated by a growing number of approved drug products, research reports, and cumulative numbers of clinical trials [13]. The two classes have virtues and detriments relating to biological and physiochemical features. In the past, innumerable types of lipids have been used in many drug conveyance methods including solid lipid nanoparticles, liposomes, druglipid complexes, and nanostructured lipid carriers [14,15]. As long as the lipid components of the liposome are obtained from natural sources, they are biodegradable, biocompatible, flexible, mildly toxic or nontoxic, and non-immunogenic for both systemic and non-systemic use [16]. \n\nLiposomal drugs have some disadvantages related to chemical and physical stability, sterilization, batch-to-batch reproducibility, manufacturing scale-up as well as drug entrapment [17]. However, polymeric nanoparticles have merits in terms of a larger variety of preparation methodologies, the ability of tissue penetration, smaller particle size, improved stability in biological fluids, availability of various polymers, release profiles, and versatile drug loading [18]. The use of toxic organic solvents in the manufacturing process, drug leakage before reaching target tissues, poor drug encapsulation for hydrophilic drugs, scale-up issues, polymer cytotoxicity, and polymer degradation are all disadvantages of polymeric nanoparticles [19]. Therefore, in this formulation, we tried to improve the physiochemical and pharmacokinetic parameters of the nanocarriers in terms of size, shape, stability, high drug loading efficiency, shelf-life, and controlled drug release pattern by merging lipids with drug-encapsulated PLGA and selecting optimized formulation parameters.",

This property may be more significant for gene drugs, as different lipids may contribute differently to nucleic acid encapsulation and delivery efficiency [45]. \n\nFunctionalization with ligands such as transferrin, lactoferrin, and peptides targeting integrins (e.g., RGD peptide) enhances the specificity of LNPs to glioblastoma cells. For example, NLCs functionalized with cyclic RGD peptides have shown improved targeting efficiency and tumor penetration in GBM mouse models. Additionally, surface modification with polyethylene glycol (PEG) enhances systemic circulation and minimizes immune clearance. Compared to polymeric nanoparticles and inorganic systems, LNPs provide superior biocompatibility, safety, and BBB-crossing potential. Polymeric nanoparticles, while versatile, often face challenges with biodegradability and immune clearance. Inorganic nanoparticles, such as gold or mesoporous silica, excel in imaging and theranostic applications but may exhibit cytotoxicity at higher concentrations. LNPs combine biocompatibility with flexibility for functionalization, making them ideal for targeted and sustained drug delivery in GBM therapy [46].",

            "text": "Polymeric nanoparticles have demonstrated considerable promise in targeted drug delivery for the treatment of a plethora of diseases. The term \"nanoparticle\" encompasses the characteristics of both nanocapsules and nanospheres, which vary morphologically. Nanocapsules (reservoir system), have a fatty kernel in which the drug is generally dispersed and a polymeric shell that regulates the profile of the drug's release from the core. The drug can be sustained within or adsorbed onto the surface of nanospheres (matrix system), which are made up of a continuous polymeric network [25]. \n\nApart from the existing advantages, polymeric NPs demonstrate the distinct drawbacks of toxic decay and toxic monomer accumulation, as well as a toxic degradation mechanism that hinders their utility [26]. The lipid NPs also exhibit poor drug-loading capacities, low membrane retention properties, physical state instability of lipids, and diminished cell membrane fluidity, all of which contribute to lipid NPs' loss of stability (drug expulsion, gelation, etc.) during storage and administration. \n\nTo overcome the limitations of both lipid NPs and polymeric NPs, polymeric lipid hybrid nanoparticles (PLNs) have emerged. The word \"hybrid\" is used as the NPs have the properties of both polymeric and lipid particles [27]. The polymer regulates the drug release, while the utility of the lipid is to improve the permeation of drugs across the membrane and loading. Polymeric lipid hybrid nanoparticles (PLNs) have the ability to improve the biocompatibility and physical stability of drugs, paving the way for their promising use in robust drug delivery.",

[71] Liposomes, characterized as spherical vesicles comprising one or more concentric layers of phospholipid bilayers, are distinguished by their non-toxicity and biodegradability and have established themselves as efficacious drug delivery vehicles, extensively used within the realm of biomedical research. In 1990, M.R. Gasco and R.H. M\u00fcller pioneered an alternative to traditional nano-systems, synthesizing what came to be known as solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) to dis-tinguish them from nano-emulsions and fluidic liposomes. [72] In 1999, a new type of lipid nanoparticle nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) was developed. [73] These NLCs are characterized by a matrix composed of both solid and liquid lipids. As integral members of this lipid nanoparticle family, liposomes, SLNs, and NLCs possess an oil-in-water (O/W) biphasic composition that improves the solubility of water-insoluble drugs commonly employed in ophthalmic therapy. Their expansive specific surface area optimizes drug interaction and retention time within the eye. Moreover, by increasing the proportion of liquid lipid and employing diverse surfactants to achieve smaller particle sizes, drug penetration into the eye is improved. As a result, these lipid nanoparticles can be efficiently used in various ophthalmic applications with the aforementioned design. \n\nLiposomes: Liposomes, typically ranging in diameter from 80 to 1000 nm, are structurally composed of single, double, or multiple concentric closed vesicles made up of lipid bilayers, which encapsulate an inner core that is hydrophilic in nature.

            "text": "Lipid-based delivery systems, such as micelles, liposomes, and LNP, can be easily synthesized through chemical reactions [117,118]. The efficiency of delivering RNA therapy to the liver is greatly improved by distinct chemical structures and more reasonable lipid molecular design. LNPs are one of the most widely used non-viral delivery systems for oligonucleotide drugs and mRNA vaccines, and their advantages include ease of production, biodegradability, protection of the embedded RNA from RNase degradation and renal clearance, promotion of cellular uptake, and endosomal escape [119,120]. Recently, LNP has received global attention as an important component of mRNA vaccines, playing a key role in effectively protecting and transporting mRNA into cells. Polymers are the second largest class of nucleic aciddelivery vehicles after lipids. Cationic polymers form stable complexes with anionic nucleic acids, providing a versatile, scalable, and easily adaptable platform for efficient nucleic acid delivery while minimizing the immune response and cytotoxicity [121]. The efficiency of RNA delivery into cells can be altered by adjusting polymer polarity, degradation, and molecular weight. Dendrimers are another type of polymer that deliver RNA [122]. These macromolecules are centered on a core molecule and synthesize highly branched polymers via repetitive growth reactions. Modifying the dendrimer structure can protect nucleotides from enzymatic degradation. \n\nWith the development of nanomaterials, inorganic nanocarriers provide a unique platform for the effective delivery of nucleic acid drugs to tumor cells due to their high stability, good biocompatibility, low immunogenicity, and mass production, such as gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) [123,124], silica nanoparticles [125], and carbon nanotubes. AuNPs are [126] a classical inorganic nanocarrier with good chemical stability and biocompatibility [127]. Nucleic acid chains are covalently attached to the AuNP core via mercaptan groups. The abovementioned NU-0129 is a siRNA drug designed based on AuNPs to target the oncogene Bcl2L12 in GBM treatment.",

            "text": "Polymeric nanoparticles are prepared from various natural or synthetic polymers, both hydrophilic and hydrophobic (Pagels and Prud'homme, 2015). These polymers may be of natural origin, such as chitosan and alginate, or synthetics, such as poly (lactic acid, PLA) and poly (glycolic acid, PGA) or a combination of both forming the poly (lactide-co-glycolide acid, PLGA) (Bolhassani et al., 2014). When applied in vivo, polymeric nanoparticles suffer biodegradation to be metabolized and excreted by the organism, what confers better biocompatibility (Amaral and Felipe, 2013). As the polymer is degraded, the drug incorporated within is released to the medium and can efficiently reach the site of action. \n\nLiposomes are particles made by natural or synthetic phospholipids. Because of the nature of these molecules, when in contact with an aqueous medium, they form spherical structures containing an aqueous nucleus surrounded by a lipid bilayer (Bozzuto and Molinari, 2015), which can be suitable for delivery of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic substances (Stiufiuc et al., 2015). Because of their sensitivity to pH variations, liposomes permeability can be adjusted, releasing the drug into specific sites, such as macrophage compartments with altered pH during an infection (Wang et al., 2014;Jiang et al., 2015). A successful example of this class of nanoparticles is the commercially available liposomal Amphotericin B, brand name Ambisome R (Reis, 2015). In addition, solid lipid nanoparticles have been intensively investigated, specially for topical drug delivery (Kumar and Sinha, 2016;Trombino et al., 2016). They are spherical nanoparticles constituted of physiological and biodegradable lipids, such as stearic acid.

Among several nanoparticulate systems, lipid-based nanocarriers, such as liposomes, solid-lipid nanoparticles, and nanostructured lipid carriers, and biodegradable polymeric nanoparticles are the most widely adopted nanosystems for drug delivery 2 . In general, nanocarriers may protect a drug from degradation, enhance drug absorption by facilitating diffusion through epithelium, modify pharmacokinetic and drug-tissue distribution profile and/or improve intracellular penetration and distribution. Furthermore, by modulating the surface properties, composition and milieu, the desired release pattern of the drug and its biodistribution can be achieved. Additionally, one of the major advantages associated with the nanoparticulate systems is their ability to withstand physiological stress or improved biological stability and possibility of oral delivery which makes them more attractive as a drug delivery strategy than liposomes. \n\nDifferent types of nano-sized carriers, such as polymeric nanoparticles, solid lipid nanoparticles, ceramic nanoparticles, magnetic nanoparticles, polymeric micelles, polymer-drug conjugates, nanotubes, nanowires, nanocages and dendrimers, etc., are being developed for various drug-delivery applications 3 . Polymeric nanoparticles can be fabricated from polysaccharides, proteins and synthetic polymers. Nanoparticles made from natural hydrophilic polymers have been proved efficient in terms of better drug-loading capacity, biocompatibility and possibly less opsonization by reticuloendothelial system (RES) through an aqueous steric barrier 4 . \n\nPolymeric NPs play a significant role because it can deliver therapeutic agents directly into the intended site of action, with superior efficacy. These nanoparticles can enhance the systemic circulation half-life and minimize unwanted internalization and prevents the denaturation of the therapeutically active moiety and could use to deliver the target agents.",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) play a key role in the delivery of mRNA vaccines. Their ability to encapsulate and protect fragile nucleic acid cargo, such as mRNA and siRNA, while facilitating cellular uptake and endosomal escape, has positioned LNPs as the leading delivery system for mRNA vaccines. This is evidenced by the rapid development and deployment of mRNA-based vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 (Comirnaty \u00ae and Spikevax\u2122 [1]) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (mRESVIA \u00ae ), which demonstrates the scalability, safety, and efficacy of LNP formulations in clinical settings. \n\nAdvancements in LNP design have focused on optimising their composition, which typically includes an ionizable lipid, a phospholipid, cholesterol, and a PEGylated lipid. These components synergistically enhance the stability, cellular delivery, and biocompatibility of LNPs. Additionally, innovations in LNP manufacturing technologies, such as microfluidic techniques, have enabled precise control over particle size and reproducibility, further enhancing the development and clinical application of LNPs. \n\nThe performance of LNPs for mRNA delivery is dependent on their potency, in vivo distribution and targeting, ability to induce an immune response, and inherent adjuvanticity [2]. Cellular uptake of these LNPs is a multi-step process mediated by the LNP's size and the interaction between LNPs and biological fluids, specifically biomolecules such as immunoglobulins and lipoproteins [3]. LNPs can be internalised by several methods, including micropinocytosis and clathrin-mediated endocytosis, with the endocytic pathway dependent on the nanoparticle properties and the type of cells [4]. After entering the cells, the LNPs enter the endosome, where the ionisable lipid becomes protonated due to the lower, acidic pH in the endosomal compartment.",

Lena M. Kranz and colleagues utilized widely used cationic liposomes composed of DOTMA and DOPE lipids and RNA to prepare colloidally stable RNA-lipid complex (RNA-LPX) nanoparticles. These nanoparticles protect RNA from extracellular ribonucleases and mediate effective uptake and expression of encoded antigens by DCs and various lymphoid zone macrophages. By optimizing the overall particle charge, these nanoparticles can be precisely targeted to DCs in vivo (59). Researchers have also developed lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles (LPNPs), which are effective vesicles composed of single or multiple layers of lipid shells that encapsulate polymer core. LPNPs combine the advantages of lipid and polymer nanoparticles while alleviating their inherent limitations, exhibiting high stability and biocompatibility, making them an effective vaccine delivery platform (60).",

            "text": "In the first group are the inorganic ones, which include gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), Fe 3 O 4 -based nanoparticles, silica-based nanoparticles, and magnetic materials. The advantages they offer are their physicochemical properties, such as shape, surface area, amphiphilicity, biocompatibility, and easy surface functionalization. However, these nanosystems also have drawbacks, such as toxicity and clearance. The second group is the polymeric carriers, classified into natural and synthetic polymers. Natural polymers include polysaccharides, peptides, and proteins, which offer a better uptake, ability to mimic natural processes, and less toxicity; however, these present as a disadvantage their high immunogenicity and degradation in sera. On the other hand, synthetic polymers include polyethyleneimine (PEI), poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid)(PLGA), and dendrimers, to mention a few. These produce lower levels of damage to cell membranes and are less cytotoxic, but the transfection efficiency is low and they are poorly biodegradable. Finally, the third group is the lipid-based system, which includes cationic lipids, ionizable and helper lipids, and lipopolyplex [198][199][200][201][202][203]. \n\nIn this context, lipid-based systems such as nano delivery systems have attracted the field of research due to their simple synthesis and functionalization method. They are very stable, have high loading efficiency, and have low cytotoxicity [200]. They also promote the use of miRNAs that have a wide range of therapeutic targets. A single miRNA can simultaneously regulate various mRNAs, thus facilitating the uptake of nanoparticles by receptor-mediated endocytosis and reducing the required dose and treatment side effects [197]. Lipid nanoparticles are generally easy to prepare, plus scalable procedures for large-scale manufacturing are readily available. The variations in their physicochemical characteristics are attributed to differences in chemical composition, size variability, and surface properties of the particles.",

Lipid nanoparticles can be of different types (e.g., liposomes [13][14][15][16], nanoemulsions [14,17,18], solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) [19][20][21][22][23][24]), each produced from very different lipids (e.g., phospholipids, synthetic oils, essential oils from plants, fatty acids, di-, mono-, and triglycerides, cholesterol), commonly resembling those existing in the human body and also in food. Due to their lipid composition, these particles are usually referred to as biocompatible, biodegradable and are generally recognized as safe [25][26][27]. These particles are specifically tailored to load lipophilic drugs [28], but the number of examples of hydrophilic including peptides and proteins [29,30], and amphiphilic compounds loaded in lipid nanoparticles is impressive. SLN and NLC receive special attention as, due to their solid matrix, they usually show modified release profile [31][32][33][34], and can be surface-tailored for site-specific targeted delivery [35,36].",

Nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) are new-generation lipid nanoparticles prepared from both solid and liquid lipids. The core matrix of an NLC is basically soft. NLCs possess some advantages for therapy and diagnosis, including improved drug permeability, reduced adverse response, prolonged half-life, and drug/gene targeting. 3 Poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) nanoparticles are frequently used polymeric nanocarriers with biodegradability and biocompatibility. PLGA is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in parenteral injections, implants, and drug delivery systems. 4 PLGA nanoparticles hold a hard matrix in the particulate core. They are widely employed for vaccinations, cancer therapy, and theranostics. 5 Surface coating exhibits an important role in the functionality of nanomedicine. Cationic components are usually incorporated into nanoparticles for the purpose of improving cell uptake, conjugation with genes, open tight junction, and increased drug loading. 6,7 Such nanosystems are useful in the application of gene therapy, tumor targeting, brain delivery, and immunization. 8 A concern with nanosystems is the possibility of adverse effects on cells and organisms due to their smaller size and larger specific surface area compared to bulk materials. The cationic surface of nanoparticles further augments the toxicity, 9 resulting in limited applicability. Nanoparticles also influence the immunological response of cells. Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) play an essential role in immuno pathogenesis. Neutrophils participate in the communication networks that form the foundations of immunity.

            "text": "Recently, a large range of compounds and technologies are available to design and develop formulations that can induce potent immune responses against different pathogens. Lipidbased nanoparticles (LNPs) play an important role due to natural adjuvant properties. LNPs can be easily decorated with small molecules or glycans targeting the vaccine to specific type of immune cells and finally enhancing the potency of the immune response. In addition, adjuvants or antigens can be encapsulated into lipid nanoparticles. Some processes were developed to control the size of LNPs independent of lipid composition. It is interesting that mice require an average particles size (~ 100 nm) for generating high antibody levels. In contrast, all particle sizes (~ 60-150 nm) generate strong immune responses in non-human primates. The impact of LNP biophysical parameters on immunogenicity is an important step for enabling rapid development of potent vaccines against novel growing diseases. Recent advances in lipid gene delivery systems have significantly improved the efficacy and the level of expression of targeted genes. The improved structure-activity design has increased the potential of LNPs in gene therapy in tumors, and other disorders. \n\nAlthough, effective vaccine encapsulation and delivery systems with simple formulations play an important role in vaccine development; but however, optimization of the safety profile and enhancement of the vaccination efficacy are still required for various preclinical and clinical trials. Some studies demonstrate that hybrid delivery platforms increase the efficiency of vaccines for boosting a variety of immune responses. Among the all-available delivery systems, lipidic carriers show one of the most advanced platforms for vaccine delivery and targeting in vivo. Lipidic delivery systems include bilayer lipid vesicles such as liposomes, nanoliposomes, archaeosomes, vesicular lipid gels, immunovesicles, lipospheres, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN), tocosomes, and some other micro-and nanocarrier systems.",

            "text": "Therefore, drug delivery systems should be considered to increase the aqueous solubility and improve the bioavailability of SV. \n\nIn the development of nanomedicines, macromolecules (such as proteins and peptides) or small-molecule drugs could be loaded into nano-delivery systems, which show the ability of enhancing the entrance and accumulation of nanomedicines in specific cells or tissues, and in contrast to traditional small-molecule drugs, nanomedicines could minimize the side effects and toxicity [7]. Nano-delivery systems, on the whole, could be divided into two groups: polymer-and lipid-based systems [31]. Poly-(lactic acid) or poly(lactide-co-glycolide), owing to the excellent biocompatibility, biodegradability and incorporation capability for hydrophilic drugs, have been widely used to fabricate nanoparticles [28]. Wang\uf0a0et al fabricated the SIM-loaded nanoparticles and confirmed that the NPs exhibited a cumulative release of up to 80% within 72 h and had an excellent cellular uptake capacity and showed great biocompatibility with MC3T3-E1 cells [34]. Copolymer micellar nanoparticles of SV provided control drug release profiles and could control cholesterol level in hyperlipidemic rabbits [26]. However, the number of products based on the polymer system in the market is limited owing to their potential toxicity, the need to use organic solvents and the lack of suitable methods for large-scale production [3]. Lipid nanoparticles, due to their nonuse organic solvents, negligible toxicity, sustained drug release and suitability for large-scale production and sterilization [5,12], have been considered as an alternative to traditional carriers such as polymeric liposomes and nanoparticles [13,20], especially for drugs with poor water-solubility, peptides, and genes, as well as for other applications [18,21]. Nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC), the second generation of lipid nanoparticles, have been demonstrated to load various small moleculars [21,31].",

These polymeric nanoparticles are able to provide a sustainable release of antigens and improve the stability of antigens from in vivo enzymatic degradation. They can be designed to encapsulate the antigen of interest, or the antigen could be surface adsorbed on the nanoparticles to enhance antigen uptake and presentation to the immune cells. There are two main types of polymeric nanoparticles used in the development of delivery carriers for vaccines, such as chitosan and poly (lactic co-glycolide acid) (PLGA), which have shown great potential in several pre-clinical studies. from the phase II clinical trials revealed that the pseudovirus neutralization (PsVN) titers of the vaccinated individuals were boosted against all variants, including the wild-type original strain, B.1.351, and P.1 variants and the levels of antibody elicited by mRNA-1273 and mRNA-1273.351 were similar or higher than the antibody titers after the primary series of vaccinations. It is noteworthy that the mRNA-1273.351 demonstrated higher neutralization titers against B.1.351 variant when compared to the mRNA-1273 as a booster vaccine [89]. To date, the safety and effectiveness of mRNA-1273.211 are being evaluated in a clinical phase II trial with the clinical identifier (NCT04927065). \n\nIn addition to the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines, other LNP-based vaccine candidates that were progressing in clinical trials are presented in Table 1. A lipid NP encapsulating mRNA vaccine, denoted as ARCT-021, was demonstrated to be safe and well-tolerated at multiple dose levels, ranging from 1-10 \u00b5g in clinical phase I/II trial (clinical identifier: NCT04480957). In early 2020, McKay and others investigated the immunogenicity of lipid nanoparticles encapsulating a self-amplifying RNA encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein nanovaccine in the murine model.",

This coating layer can reduce the potential for unexpected immune reactions and toxicity, improve biocompatibility, prevent drug excretion, and delay drug release. 224,225 Additionally, the incorporation of amphiphilic lipids as a lipid coat can aid in stabilizing the matrix. 226 Furthermore, the incorporation of a polymeric core, such as a PLGA core, in LPHNPs can facilitate the incorporation of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs, preventing their systemic metabolism, and promoting enhanced storage stability. 227 In comparison with SLNs and liposomes, LPHNPs exhibit greater suitability for hydrophilic drugs due to their higher drug encapsulation rate. This is attributed to the electrostatic adsorption effects that enable the formation of drugpolymer complexes, which are subsequently encapsulated in hydrophobic lipids.",

            "text": "One nanoparticle that has already been approved for the first-line treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer, is the nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) [9]. Nab-paclitaxel has been confirmed as a safe and effective therapy in combination with carboplatin for patients with advanced nonsmall-cell lung cancer [10]. Although nab-paclitaxel is superior to conventional chemotherapies in terms of toxicity, there are still some safety concerns related to albumin-based nanoparticles [11,12]. Lipid nanoparticles, in contrast, have a quite high biocompatibility and are less toxic and immunogenic compared to other nanoparticles [13]. This results from the fact that LNPs are very small particles, mainly built by lipids and other biochemical compounds [8]. Administration routes are usually either systemic (intravenous injection) or local (e.g., intramuscular, intradermal, and subcutaneous injection), mainly depending on the therapeutic indication. For lung cancer, another possible application route of LNP-based agents is added: topical administration by direct inhalation into the lungs [14]. Current research suggests that LNPs hold the potential to serve as a safe and effective pulmonary drug delivery platform, allowing high concentrations at the desired site with less systemic toxicity [15]. \n\nThe current relevance of LNPs in the therapy of solid tumors, including lung cancer, also becomes evident when looking at the accepted and published abstracts at the ASCO (American Society of Clinical Oncology) Annual Meeting and the AACR (American Association for Cancer Research) Annual Meeting this year. It's not only the high number of ongoing areas of research concerning first-in-human studies on the efficacy, safety, and dosing of different LNP-associated anticancer agents that is remarkable [16,17], but also the forward-looking nature of the projects [18,19].",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are one of the frequently used and well-established bioactive nanocarriers for anti-cancer treatment, which are featured as excellent abilities to encapsulate drugs, and prolong the half-life and release time of drugs. The therapeutic efficacy enhances with the prolongation of drugs targeting tumor cells. 28 It is reported that the cytotoxicity of gemcitabine-loaded LNPs in ARO cells is significantly higher than that of free drugs. Moreover, the ammonium sulfate in the inner compartment of liposomes induces the protonation of gemcitabine and reduces the reverse diffusion of drugs in liposomes, resulting in a 90% of encapsulation effect. 29 Compared with those of free drugs, drugs loaded in LNPs present less photodegradation and stronger anti-proliferative ability against three thyroid cancer cell lines PTC1, B-CPAP and FRO. 30 LNPs are biocompatible and they can be functionalized with a variety of molecules and mRNAs. For example, a 4-fold higher accumulation of the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)-conjugated polymer-lipid hybrid nanoparticles is detected in FTC 133 xenografts than that of the non-targeted nanoparticles, and the former presents a stronger anti-cancer role against thyroid cancer. 31 Li et al 32 developed liposome-peptide-mRNA nanoparticles (LPm NP) that are composed of mRNAs, peptide core and cationic lipid core-shell nanostructures. The optimal transfection rate and delivery effect can be obtained by adjusting the nitrogen/phosphorus (N/P) ratio in the core complex and mRNA adsorption, thus increasing the proportion of cells with positively expressed sodium iodide symporter (NIS) in the ATC cell line 8505C. 32 Liposomal delivery of miR-34b-5p significantly inhibits the proliferation, migration and angiogenesis in ATC cell lines 8505C and BHT-101, which also significantly suppresses the growth of BHT-101 xenografts in nude mice. 33",

            "text": "Nanostructured Lipid Carriers (NLC) are nano-sized colloidal drug delivery system that contains a lipid mixture consisting of both solid and liquid lipids in their core. This Lipid-Based Nanosystem is introduced as a biocompatible, non-toxic, and safe nano-drug delivery system as compared to polymeric or metallic nanoparticles. Due to its safety, stability, and high drug loading capacity compared to other lipid-based nanocarriers, NLC gained the attention of researchers to formulate safe and effective drug carriers. The ability to increase drug solubility and permeability while encapsulating the drug in a lipidic shell makes them an ideal carrier for drug delivery through difficult-to-achieve routes. Surface modification of NLC and the use of various additives result in drug targeting and increased residence time. With such qualities, NLCs can be used to treat a variety of diseases such as cancer, infections, neurodegenerative diseases, hypertension, diabetes, and pain management. This review focuses on the recent developments being made to deliver the drugs and genes through different routes via these nanocarriers. Here, we also discuss about historical background, structure, types of NLC and commonly employed techniques for manufacturing lipid-based nanocarriers.",

            "text": "Lipid-based NPs are the most common ones with high safety [60,61]. Lipid-based NPs are typically composed of phospholipids, ionizable lipids, cholesterol, and PEGylated lipids [15]. The most typical form of these NPs is spherical particles, which primarily consist of an internal hydrophilic part and an external lipid molecular layer. Lipid-based NPs as a delivery system have numerous advantages, including self-assembly, simple emulation, the ability to carry large loads, biocompatibility, and adjustable physicochemical properties [62]. The most typical representatives of such NPs are liposomes and lipid NPs (LNPs). \n\nLiposomes, the most numerous types, are nanoparticle vesicles formed by the selfassembly of amphiphilic phospholipid molecules. They have been utilized in various scientific fields, typically for loading and delivering compounds with various properties, such as lipophilic, amphiphilic, or hydrophilic compounds [63]. Liposomes are frequently employed as carriers for gene delivery, enabling the encapsulation of DNA or RNA for gene therapy or gene editing. Due to the rapid absorption of liposomes by the reticuloendothelial system, their application is limited. Typically, the surface modification of liposomes is performed to prolong their circulation and enhance delivery, enabling their clinical use [64]. Additionally, the size of NPs affects cellular uptake. Generally, NPs smaller than 10 nm in diameter are rapidly cleared by the kidneys, while NPs with a diameter exceeding 200 nm are prone to triggering the complement system. Hence, the typical size of NPs used in immunotherapy is usually between 10 and 200 nm [65]. \n\nFurthermore, another type of lipid-based NP is LNPs. Recently developed LNPs are mainly composed of ionizable lipids, helper lipids, PEG-lipids, and cholesterol [66,67]. LNPs are extensively used for delivering nucleic acids and resemble liposomes in structure.",

Encapsulation of small molecules, biological drugs, and nucleic acids in nanocarriers have shown great potential for OA treatment [37]. The main advantages include: (1) superior drug targeting and bioavailability; (2) reduced toxicity and adverse effects; (3) higher drug solubility and stability; (4) prolonged retention time in the cartilage; (5) increased drug efficacy [38][39][40]. \n\nLipid based nanoparticles (LNPs) and liposomes were the first nanocarriers approved by FDA and have many therapeutic applications, such as the current COVID-19 mRNA-LNPs vaccines [41]. They are considered as ideal drug delivery systems due to their excellent biocompatibility and low toxicity, as well as for encapsulating both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drug cargos [42,43]. Despite these promising features, rapid clearance from synovial fluid remains an issue for OA therapy [14]. Other nanocarriers also show important limitations: exosomes display manufacturing challenges [44] and inorganic NPs lack deeper toxicological assessment in literature [45]. Finally, the clinical application of micelles and dendrimers is still hampered by the non-encapsulation of hydrophilic drugs and toxicity concerns [39]. In this review, we focus on another class of delivery vehicles-the polymeric nanoparticles (PNPs). \n\nPolymeric nanoparticles are solid particles that can incorporate hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs, such as small molecules, proteins, and nucleic acids. They are extensively used in the field of nanomedicine due to their structural versatility, facile synthesis, and higher stability when compared to other nanoparticle types.",

            "text": "Research and development in the field of drug delivery systems facilitating site-speci\u00de c therapy has achieved signi\u00de cant progression. Safe and nontoxic formulation of cytotoxic drug and its site specific delivery at its target-tumor tissue or tumor cells have become the major goal of the research. Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) is a novel nanoparticulate systems made from solid lipids and are attracting major attention as novel colloidal drug carrier, which combines the advantages of polymeric nanoparticles, fat emulsions and liposomes simultaneously and avoids some of their disadvantages. Cisplatin is an important class of antitumor agent and is widely used in the treatment of many malignancies including testicular, ovarian, bladder, head, neck and lung. However the clinical use of this drug is limited due to the emergence of intrinsic and acquired resistance and severe side effects such as acute nephrotoxicity and chronic neurotxicity 1 . Solid lipid nanoparticles are colloidal carriers developed as an alternative system to the existing traditional carrier system (emulsion, liposome, polymeric nanoparticles). Polymeric nanoparticles may contain toxic monomers, residue from solvents, and may form toxic degradation product 2 . The SLN consists of biocompatible lipid core and an amphiphilic surfactant at the outer shell. The additional advantage of the SLN are the large scale production, protection of the drug against chemical degradation, ease of modulation of the drug release pro\u00de le and high drug pay load 3 . Intravenous administration of cisplatin produces adverse effects like ototoxicity, renal failure, and loss of hearing, optic neuritis, cerebral blindness, papilloedema, tubular necrosis, focal encephalopathy and cardiac abnormalities. All these adverse effects limit the amount of drug to be given to the patient. Hence, to overcome these inherent drawbacks associated with parenteral drug delivery of cisplatin an attempt is being made to provide an alternative drug delivery system of cisplatin in the form of SLN to reduce the adverse effects and to enhance therapeutic ef\u00de cacy of the drug.",

            "text": "The authors obtained a good separation profile for liposomes and three main acceptor domains (albumin, HDL, and LDL) [58]. This study confirmed that rigid liposomes and PEGylated fluid liposomes showed higher stability in human plasma when compared to non-PEGylated fluid liposomes. This means that the bilayer composition of a liposomal formulation plays a significant role in stability and drug release in biological media. Hence, separation of the plasma-liposome sample by AF4 seems to be a potential alternative to already established methods. \n\nLipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are typically spherical nanoparticles with a solid lipid core that act as a novel pharmaceutical drug delivery system [84,85]. LNPs were first approved as a drug delivery vehicle in 2018 for the drug Onpattro to treat polyneuropathy in patients with hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis [86]. It became more widely known in late 2020 because some COVID-19 vaccines, notably mRNA-1273 [87] and BNT162b [88], used PEGylated-lipid nanoparticles for mRNA delivery [89]. Similar to liposomal drug formulations, determination of payload content relative to LNP size can be important to understand the efficacy and safety. AF4 has been successfully used for the separation and characterization of lipid-based drug delivery systems; however, electrostatically interacting LNP complexes with the relatively labile lipid-monolayer coating are more prone to destabilization during the focusing step in the conventional AF4 channel [90]. \n\nNon-focusing AF4 channels (frit-inlet or dispersion channel) can circumvent the instability of the LNPs during conventional AF4 separation. In a recent study, Mildner et al., demonstrated AF4 with the frit-inlet channel was well-suited for the analysis of lipid-based nanoparticles for RNA delivery with satisfactory reproducibility and sample recovery [39].",

            "text": "Based on lipid and polymeric NCs limitations, lipid-polymer hybrid NPs (LPN), also called lipid-core nanocapsules (LPC) emerged as a new NC for drug delivery (Figure 2D). They share the characteristics of both lipid (SLN and NLC) and biocompatible polymeric particles [38]. While lipid increases the loading capacity and drug permeation, the polymer regulates the drug release [64]. LPN is structured by diffusion of a sorbitan monostearate in capric/caprylic triglyceride, forming a solid organogel surrounded by a polymer wall, and coated with the polysorbate 80 as a stabilizing surfactant [65]; this system allows the loading of hydrophobic drugs into lipid core and hydrophilic drugs into polymer shell. Although the LPN structure is complex, their preparation methods are quite simple. As a recently developed nanoparticle system, LPNs have been largely used in the latest years [38]. \n\nOverall, most studies using LPN as carriers of melatonin have focused on the antioxidant and antiapoptotic effect of this compound in different experimental models, such as liver microsomes [65,66], in vitro antioxidant assay [67], pulmonary cells [68], nematodes [69,70], and bovine embryo culture [71,72]. The presence of melatonin in LPN has decreased significantly lipid peroxidation depending on specific dose and lipid substrate. In this regard, melatonin, at doses of 400 \u00b5M, was sufficient to provide their protective effects; the encapsulation rate of melatonin in LPNs (55%) was higher than that of nanoemulsion (33%), thus improving its antioxidative effect [65,73]. Despite this potential, the co-encapsulation of lipoic acid with melatonin (2.4 or 4.8 mM) in LPN did not improve the protection against lipid peroxidation in the liver microsomes compared to the nanoencapsulation of individual agents [67].",

Establishing the safety of new nanoparticle formulations is the first important step on the pathway to clinical translation. We have recently shown that plasma-polymerized nanoparticles (PPNs) are highly efficient nanocarriers and a viable, cost-effective alternative to conventional chemically synthesized nanoparticles. Here, we present the first comprehensive toxicity and biosafety study of PPNs using both established in vitro cell models and in vivo models. Overall, we show that PPNs were extremely well tolerated by all the cell types tested, significantly outperforming commercially available lipid-based nanoparticles (lipofectamine) used at the manufacturer\u2019s recommended dosage. Supporting the in vitro data, the systemic toxicity of PPNs was negligible in BALB/c mice following acute and repeated tail-vein intravenous injections. PPNs were remarkably well tolerated in mice without any evidence of behavioral changes, weight loss, significant changes to the hematological profile, or signs of histological damage in tissues. PPNs were tolerated at extremely high doses without animal mortality observed at 6000 mg/kg and 48,000 mg/kg for acute and repeated-injection regimens, respectively. Our findings demonstrate the safety of PPNs in biological systems, adding to their future potential in biomedical applications.",

According to the size of lipid-based nanoparticles, they are named as micelles (\u223c15 nm), liposomes (\u223c100 nm) or polymeric NPs (Paulis et al., 2012;Vinhas et al., 2017). Micelles consist of lipids and other amphiphilic artificial molecules that self-assemble in aqueous solution and form a monolayer with the hydrophobic phase inside that incorporates hydrophobic therapeutic agents (Katsuki et al., 2017). The enclosed space in the micelle is more confined than that in liposomes (Katsuki et al., 2017). Liposomes are heavily investigated in nanomedicine and are the first to get FDA approval for nanomedicine (Katsuki et al., 2017;Vinhas et al., 2017). Liposomes mainly consist of phospholipids that form bilayers with the aqueous phase inside, conferring superior biocompatibility to the liposomes (Katsuki et al., 2017). Polymeric nanoparticles, such as polylactic acid (PLA), polyglycolic acid (PGA), and poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) are FDA-approved polymers. PLGA is a copolymer of PLA and PGA and is being tested for drug delivery systems for intractable diseases, including cardiovascular diseases (Pascual-Gil et al., 2017;Oduk et al., 2018). \n\nLipid NPs are broadly considered as promising candidates for the delivery of therapeutics in the infarcted heart.

A new technique uses lipid-polymeric hybrid nanoparticles (LPHNPs) with a polymeric core, and a shell made up of lipid-lipid-PEG lipids. They have properties which complement polymer nanoparticles and liposomes, and they have the potential to improve the physical stability and biocompatibility of the active pharmaceutical ingredient encapsulated in them. Evaporating the solvent from a dual-phase solution containing lipid and polymer is one of the most effective methods for producing the lipid polymeric hybrid nanoparticles. The LPHNPs applications has also been significantly expanded to include combinational and active targeted drug delivery, as well as delivery of genetic materials, vaccines, and diagnostic imaging agents, in addition to single drug delivery for anticancer therapy, like Glioblastoma. Main goal: The main agenda of this compilation was to address the effects of LPHNPs on Glioblastoma treatment. This compilation also highlights some of the formulation techniques and issues that arise during the preparation of LPHNPs. This review also discusses recent developments in core-shell lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles, which were conferred in considerable detail later in this article. Conclusion: The main issue which arises while using nanoparticles with polymer is entrapment efficiency. Because of their hybrid components, LPHNPs have proven to solve this problem to a large extent. The recent research trends suggest that lipid polymeric hybrid nanoparticles will prove to be highly effective or productive in treating diseases such as Glioblastoma.",

Due to the prominent advantages, such as long circulation time, slow drug release, reduced toxicity, high transfection efficiency, and endosomal escape capacity, such synthetic nanoparticles have been widely used for carrying genetic therapeutics, particularly nucleic acids that can be applied in the treatment for various diseases, including congenital diseases, cancers, virus infections, and chronic inflammations. Despite great merits and multiple successful applications, many extracellular and intracellular barriers remain and greatly impair delivery efficacy and therapeutic outcomes. As such, the current state of knowledge and pitfalls regarding the gene delivery and construction of LBNPs will be initially summarized. In order to develop a new generation of LBNPs for improved delivery profiles and therapeutic effects, the modification strategies of LBNPs will be reviewed. On the basis of these developed modifications, the performance of LBNPs as therapeutic nanoplatforms have been greatly improved and extensively applied in immunotherapies, including infectious diseases and cancers. However, the therapeutic applications of LBNPs systems are still limited due to the undesirable endosomal escape, potential aggregation, and the inefficient encapsulation of therapeutics. Herein, we will review and discuss recent advances and remaining challenges in the development of LBNPs for nucleic acid-based immunotherapy.",

Polymeric nanoparticles are colloidal biocompatible systems that attract significant attention in biomedicine and bioengineering [54]. When drugs are incorporated into these nanoparticles, they are protected from biodegradation by the wound proteases and are released in a sustained and controlled manner to reduce frequent administration. Presently, most polymeric nanoparticles are formulated from PLGA, chitosan, gelatin, alginate, etc. Nanoparticles that are prepared from these polymers can be further loaded in bioactive wound dressings [55] Lipid nanoparticles are mostly designed with lipid molecules or physiological lipids, and their formulation does not require the use of toxic organic solvents [55]. Lipid nanoparticles are divided into two groups: nanostructured lipid nanocarriers (NLCs) and solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs). The potential of nanoparticles for topical cosmetic or therapeutic purposes has been moderately exploited [55]. NLCs are prepared using oil, while SLNs are prepared using organic solvents. SLNs are hydrophobic, and the drug is loaded in its core resulting in a slow drug release. They are also characterized by large surface area and low toxicity [46].\n\nInorganic nanoparticles are composed of inorganic materials, such as ceramic nanoparticles, metallic nanoparticles (metal oxide nanoparticles), carbon-based nanoparticles, etc. [56]. These nanoparticles demonstrate attractive advantages in wound healing management and superior bactericidal effect. The activity and toxicity of inorganic nanoparticles depend on key features, such as dimension and architecture (smaller particles are more biologically active), surface charge, poly-dispersity index, and surface functionalization. Therefore, the combination of inorganic nanoparticles is essential for synergistic stimulating therapeutic effect.

            "text": "Being highly biocompatible and even biodegradable, lipid-based theranostic systems provide advanced delivery of therapeutic and imaging agents, thus improving pharmacokinetic profile, and safety (Valetti et al., 2013). Moreover, LNPs can overcome many biological obstacles (Kim et al., 2018), thus attracting increasing attention of the researchers day by day (Garc\u00eda-Pinelet al.), (Tang et al., 2018). In addition to their potential to cross various physiological barriers, these nanocarriers can be functionalized with several targeting moieties to enhance penetration across the barriers (Olusanya, Haj Ahmad, Ibegbu, Smith, Elkordy), (Riaz et al., 2018). Furthermore, temperature dependent self-assembly of lipid molecules, termed as thermo-responsive LNPs (TLNs), have served to enhance the drug permeability across the blood brain barrier (BBB) with potential to target glioblastoma cells (Rehman et al., 2017a). (See section 2 for suitability of lipid nanotheranostic system). \n\nAmong several LNPs, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs), lipid nanocapsules (LNCs), liposomes, and coreshell lipid nanoparticles (CLNs) have been widely explored in recent years. Specifically, SLNs and NLCs have shown promising potential as oral drug carriers anticipated to help the scientists planning to conduct studies on lipid-based nanocarriers (Okur et al., 2020). Ample studies aren't present regarding in vivo analysis of different aspects of NLCs as they have recently joined the plethora of lipid nanocarriers (Feitosa, Geraldes, Beraldo-de-Ara\u00fajo, Costa, Oliveira-Nascimento). \n\nSLNs corresponding to the colloidal drug delivery method comprise of a solid-lipid core that retains its solid phase at both, room and body temperatures. The solid core is hydrophobic covered by single layer of phospholipids, while the drug is normally dissolved or dispersed in the core.",

Liposomes, on the other hand, exhibit high biocompatibility, resembling biological membranes and seamlessly integrating with the pulmonary surfactant layer in the lungs [20]. To combine the advantages of liposomes and polymeric nanoparticles, lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles (LPHNPs) have been developed. The structure of LPHNPs comprises a polymer core encapsulating the drug, a phospholipid shell ensuring biocompatibility, and an outer layer of stabilizer aimed at enhancing in vivo circulation time and providing steric stabilization [21]. These characteristics have made LPHNPs a promising drug delivery platform, especially for pulmonary delivery [20,22]. As reported in the literature, LPHNPs have been used to deliver various therapeutics, such as small molecules, nucleic acids, or a combination of both, as inhalable formulations for pulmonary diseases and achieved the desired outcome [23][24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31]. \n\nGiven the potential of IVM as an anti-cancer agent and recognizing the advantages of lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles (LPHNPs) for pulmonary delivery, the aim of this study is to develop inhalable IVM-loaded LPHNPs and evaluate their characteristics and suitability for pulmonary delivery. For this purpose, we used (1) polycaprolactone, serving as the polymer core, which provides a sustained release profile, structural integrity, and stability; (2) lecithin, forming the lipid shell to improve biocompatibility by mimicking the surfactant lining of the lung; along with (3) Pluronic F127 as the outer stabilizer/surfactant. The ability of Pluronic F127 to attenuate the binding of NPs to mucin and increase mucus penetration has been reported in previous studies [32,33].",

            "text": "Drugs administered via mucosal surfaces (buccal, sublingual, nasal, and intestinal tissues) provide local and/or systemic pharmacological action [21,22]. Novel mucosal delivery systems have been developed to optimize the efficacy and safety of drugs administered by these routes. Nanostructured systems are considered the most promising strategies [23,24]. Polymeric and solid lipid nanoparticles, nanostructured lipid carriers, and nanoemulsions are examples of nanotechnologies that offer numerous benefits including improved solubility for hydrophobic drugs, controlled drug release, and enhanced stability and bioavailability [25,26]. Polymeric nanoparticles (PNPs) are extensively employed due to their favorable properties, not the least of which include their ease of manufacture, low toxicity, biocompatibility, protection of drug, and biodegradation [27,28]. PNPs are defined as particles with a size ranging from 10 nm to 1000 nm that are composed of either natural polymers (gelatin, albumin, chitosan) or synthetic polymers such as polylactides (PLA), poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA), and polyglycolides (PGA) [28,29]. The incorporation of mucoadhesive polymers that adhere to a mucosal surface prolongs the residence time at the administration site of these drug delivery systems, increasing the local or systemic bioavailability [30]. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a hydrophilic polymer that is non-toxic and used in many pharmaceutical formulations. Surface coating with PEG is reported to prevent non-specific interactions of serum proteins with NPs [31]. PLGA-PEG copolymer nanoparticles are composed of a hydrophilic surface of PEG around a hydrophobic core of PLGA [32]. This structure allows the encapsulation of hydrophobic drugs into the core region and prolongs the circulation time while the PEG hydrophilic shield around the particle core augments mucus-penetrating properties [33,34].",

As a result, Nanophytomedicines have been sought by combining biologically active phytochemicals with nanotechnology through numerous cutting-edge delivery systems. \n\nOf these systems, polymeric nanoparticles and lipid-based ones have been considered the most efficient drug carriers for bioavailability enhancement. For instant, they allow a sustained release of drugs in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), improved nanoscopic dimensions, and bioadhesion 2 . In addition, lipid based delivery systems have excellent biocompatibility and biomimetic nature, so, they exhibit multi-fold applications in tumor targeting, gene delivery, and macrophage targeting 3 . Unfortunately, lipid-based delivery systems alone suffer from reduced biological as well as physico-chemical stability, high polydispersity, biphasic release, narrow scope of surface functionalization, insufficient content integrity, and drug expulsion during storage 4 . Conversely, polymeric nanoparticles reveal better stability and structural integrity, minimized drug leakage and burst release, sustained plasma circulation, reduced polydispersity, imparting stimuli responsiveness and site specificity. But like lipid-based delivery systems, they exhibit certain disadvantages such as, the drug loading and entrapment efficiency for hydrophilic drugs are low, organic solvents exposure, toxicity and biocompatibility problems 5 . \n\nIn a nutshell, both systems (lipid and polymer-based ones) possess distinctive features, but suffer from certain demerits individually. Integration of both systems could potentially synergize their unique features and overcome the difficulties related to each system alone. This hybrid endeavor is termed lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles (LPHNPs) or lipomer 6 . LPHNPs can be sub-categorized regarding their structure into: self-emulsifying, lipidshell polymer core, polymer-shell lipid-core, and matrix-structured LPH.",

            "text": "In recent years, advances in field of nanotechnology have demonstrated potential for precision medicine. For instance, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) can be used for the targeted delivery of therapeutic molecules, increasing their bioavailability and pharmacokinetic properties beyond the Lipinski rules (1). Indeed, the development of nucleic acid therapeutics has long been hampered by the inherent hydrophilic nature, large size, and poor membrane permeability of nucleic acids (2). LNPs can be a potent alternative to viral-mediated nucleic acid delivery, with an extensive range of applications such as RNA interference (RNAi) therapy or RNA-based vaccines through intracellular delivery, respectively, of short interfering RNA (siRNA) or messenger RNA (mRNA) (3).\n\nOne of the primary advantages associated with LNPs is their biocompatibility that enables their use in vivo for human therapy (4,5). LNPs are made of two major components: a lipid phase and a water phase containing surfactants. LNPs are generally divided into liposomes with an aqueous core or other LNPs; the latter could be solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) with a solid core and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) featuring a core that is a mixture of solid and molten lipids (6). This subclass of LNPs was initially designed to improve the colloidal stability of lipid carriers and increase the drug payload into the core by controlling the release profile (7). Moreover, they are considered advantageous because their manufacturing processes can be easily scaled up for large production (8).\n\nDue to the nature of their lipid core, these particles are not well adapted for nucleic acid encapsulation. The loading of biomacromolecules such as siRNA or mRNA, therefore, occurs through the association with their shell either by chemical modifications of Polyethylene glycol (PEG) residues (9) or by incorporation of cationic lipids at the level of phospholipid monolayer, thus allowing electrostatic interactions with negatively charged nucleic acids (9)(10)(11)(12). The most chosen cationic lipids are quaternised cat",

            "text": "Lipid-based nanoparticles, such as solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) and liposomes, are a group of nanoparticles used extensively for oral drug delivery due to their excellent biocompatibility, similarity with biological membranes, and drug loading capacity. Liposomes were the first nanocarriers approved by FDA for clinical use [92]. They are composed of an aqueous core, which encapsulates hydrophilic drugs, and an amphiphilic lipid bilayer, which allows for the loading of hydrophobic drugs [93] (Fig. 5a). Additionally, they can be utilized as the carrier of biomolecules like peptides, antigens or antibodies which are covalently attached to the polyethylene glycol (PEG)-coated (PEGylated) surface of liposomes (Fig. 5c). Functionalization of liposomes with PEG limits their recognition by phagocytic cells, resulting in longer circulation time and enhanced biodistribution [94]. Furthermore, different targeting agents can be conjugated to the external surface of the liposomes for the enhanced targeted delivery of therapeutic agents to specific cells. The encapsulation of hydrophilic drugs and biologics inside of liposomes significantly improves their cellular absorption [95,96]. However, the efficiency of conventional phospholipid or cholesterol-based liposomes is seriously affected by instability of their lipid vesicles and phospholipid hydrolysis or oxidation in the GI tract. Therefore, chemical and physical functionalization is employed to increase their residence time in the intestine and enhance their stability, as we will discuss in later sections.\n\nSLNs contain a monolayer phospholipid shell and a solid lipid core [97]. These nanoparticles can be utilized for encapsulation of lipophilic ingredients and insoluble drugs. SLNs are prepared from synthetic or natural biodegradable and biocompatible lipids, such as fatty acids, triglycerides, steroids, and phospholipids. They have shown high stability in the harsh conditions of the GI, as compared to other lipid nanoparticles, such as",

            "text": "Nanoparticles (NPs) can be categorized as (i) purely organic compound NPs or (ii) inorganic NPs, based on the elements that built up their structure (Figure 4) [56]. The majority of organic materials are biocompatible, biodegradable, and non-toxic. However, inorganic materials are characterized by their smaller particle size, stability, controlled tunability, higher permeability, efficient antigen loadings, and triggered-release profile. \n\nOrganic molecule-based nanosystems developed as delivery vehicles of antioxidants include liposomes, micelles, and polymeric nanoparticles. Liposomes, for example, are lipid-based nanomaterials that consist of an aqueous core surrounded by a phospholipid bilayer. Depending on the hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance and molecular shapes, the amphiphilic structures enable the formation of thermodynamically stable vesicles [57]. Amphiphilic molecules can also self-assemble to form micelles, which contain hydrophilic (polar) headgroups and hydrophobic (nonpolar) tails. In aqueous media, micelles are typically assembled with the polar part facing the exterior and the nonpolar region constituting the core. \n\nSolid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) are widely known transporters of chemotherapeutic agents to the CNS [37]. These matrix-type lipid particles, usually consisting of fatty acids or mono-, di-, or triglycerides, remain with a solid core at body temperature. Cubosomes are liquid crystalline nanostructures created from cubic-phase-forming lipids, such as monoolein and phytantriol [29,35,38], which have the unique ability to disperse into nanoparticles that are stable upon dilution [57][58][59]. Liposomes and cubosomes can encapsulate hydrophobic drugs in the lipid bilayer membranes and hydrophilic compounds in the aqueous compartments [29,35,37]. \n\nPolymeric nanoparticles are particles with sizes between 5 and 1000 nm.",

By increasing the formula's solubility, dispersion, permeability, and overall bioavailability, such formulations improve the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics characteristics of NPs. A novel method known as LPHNPs may be used to create extremely selective and efficient nanoparticles that are ultimately stable and successful in the drug delivery platform. LPHNPs are important in the treatment of cardiovascular disease, asthma, and infectious illness. 4 This medication delivery mechanism is important in the treatment of infection because it transports hydrophobic as well as hydrophilic medicines and regulates their release rate. The membranes define a cellular border and offer a framework for strict regulation of a variety of biological activities, including resource movement, signal transduction, trade, pathogenic pathways, intercellular structure, and extracellular matrix response. Because they are biocompatible and biodegradable, polymer and lipid-based nanocarriers, such as liposomes and polymeric nanoparticles, are effective product nanocarriers. Polymer nanoparticles made from natural or synthetic polymers have gotten a lot of interest since they can be loaded with water and water medications both to guarantee drug formulation stability and control. High stability and biocompatibility, extended circulation duration, high drug loading capacity, controlled drug release characteristics, and in vivo effectiveness are only a few of the advantages of polymeric nanoparticles. Liposomes are thought to have a high level of biocompatibility, a well-defined pharmacokinetics profile, and the ability to alter the surface, especially polyethylene glycol (PEG), resulting in a longer circulation duration. In the medication and gene delivery area, the benefits of both liposomes and polymeric nanoparticles are selected. 5 LPHNPs are core-shell nanoparticles that encapsulate a large number of hydrophobic medicines in a polymeric hydrophobic core that keeps them physically and chemically stable.",

            "text": "One major reason for using LNP is their ability to control drug release kinetics. The drug delivery kinetics from LNP depends on their composition, the nature of the active molecule, and its localization inside the nanoparticle. The interactions between the active molecule and the liquid and solid lipids are especially crucial. In vitro tests have shown that LNP dispersions generally provide a prolonged release of loaded drugs [7]. The constraints of the in vivo environment can, however, require some adaptations to the design of LNP. To improve the blood half-life of the particles, PEG-based surfactants can be included as membrane ingredients. Adding PEG chains on the surface of the nanoparticle allows to prolong systemic circulation time and decrease immunogenicity [27,28]. \n\nWhile LNP provide stability and enhance the solubility of hydrophobic active molecules, drug release from LNP still, sometimes, displays a characteristic burst effect profile. This is especially the case when the active molecule is located both in the core and at the membrane of the lipid nanoparticle [5]. This specific kinetics can be desirable for transdermal delivery; it creates a mono-layer of the active ingredient on the skin, improving the drug permeation through the stratum corneum [29,30]. However, it is also often seen as undesirable because of its contribution to local or systemic drug toxicity and because it also reduces the blood half-time of the drug. It may lead to a poor delivery of the active ingredient and a poor therapeutic outcome. \n\nMoreover, when LNP are used for dermal, transdermal or ocular drug delivery, they need to be dispersed in a 3D mechanical matrix to remain at the administration site to prevent undesired systemic and local side-effects (irritation, inflammation). The encapsulation of LNP inside a suitable delivery vehicle could prevent such negative features. Indeed, a double encapsulation system-drug loaded into LNP, themselves entrapped in a vehicle material-could provide spatial and temporal control over drug delivery. Moreover, the vehicle, as is the case for certain hydrogels, can display interesting properties such as muco-adhesion and enhanced biocompatibility [31].",

            "text": "In contrast, nucleic-acid nano-delivery systems present a promising therapeutic strategy for delivering nucleic acids to regulate gene expression in specific cells [139]. The nanotechnology drug delivery systems used for miRNA applications, including inorganic nanoparticles, polymeric nanoparticles, lipid nanoparticles, and carbon-based nanomaterials, are reviewed in Section 4. Compared with organic nanoparticles, inorganic nanoparticles may have inferior biodegradability properties. The integrity, biodistribution, and fate of several inorganic nanoparticles after in vivo administration have been investigated, and increasing experimental evidence suggests that these compounds may degrade in vivo [140]. \n\nThe nanomaterials discussed in this study involve various materials sourced from organisms such as chNPs, PLGA, and liposomes. These biomaterials have emerged as outstanding choices for biosensor development [141]. Their unique properties, such as biocompatibility, biodegradability, and ease of modification, make them highly suitable for advancing biomedical applications [142][143][144]. Biopolymeric nanoparticles are increasingly important as nanocarriers for various biomedical applications, facilitating long-term and controlled release at targeted sites [145]. Lipid nanocarriers have been developed as a drug delivery system for oil extracts from Citrus aurantium L. blossoms and Rosa damascene [146]. In addition, there are several bioproduced inorganic particles such as silica and CaCO 3 . \n\nIt is important to note that each variant of nanoparticles combined with miRNAs can exhibit unique properties. Each specific case requires its own optimized system. Factors such as cell toxicity, nanoparticle stability, cellular uptake, and cargo release vary significantly across different systems. These differences can determine which system is most useful in particular situations. Therefore, tailored optimization for each application is crucial to maximize the efficacy and safety of nanoparticle-based miRNA delivery systems.",

            "text": "Nanoparticles have been synthesized in a variety of forms from various constituents. Solid lipid nanoparticles constitute organic solid lipids such as mono-di-and  triglycerides, free fatty acids and alcohols or waxes and steroids [40]. These lipids are dispensed in water to form a nanosized colloidal dispersion with a large size range of 50-1000 nM, an emulsifier is added to stabilize the formulation [40]. Lipid constituents offer great advantages as nanocarriers for anticancer drugs classified as class II and class IV in the Biopharmaceutical classification system, where aqueous solubility is low [40]. This is because they increase the solubilization of lipophilic drugs and enhance their bioavailability. These delivery systems also provide controlled drug delivery, they are biocompatible and biodegradable and have greater drug payloads as well as improved stability and are feasible for large-scale manufacture [40]. Another type of nanoparticles is polymeric nanoparticles these are solid nanosized colloidal particles that are formulated as nanospheres or nanocapsules depending on the structural organization [40]. They are made from both synthetic biodegradable polymers such as polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid, PEG and N-(2-hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide, or natural polymers such as albumin, alginate, collagen, chitosan and heparin [40]. The advantage of using polymeric nanoparticles is that they are usually biocompatible and biodegradable, hence reduce toxicity and are degraded in the body by normal metabolic routes [40]. They also offer greater drug stability in the circulation and during storage, are formulated to be homogenous compared to liposomes and retain the enhanced bioavailability characteristic of nanocarriers [40].\n\nA successful example of an anticancer polymeric nanoparticle that has been approved by the FDA is Abraxane\u00ae, for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer and NSCLC. It constitutes the chemotherapeutic taxane paclitaxel bound to the natural polymer",

This improvement in oral absorption can play a pivotal role in enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of such drugs. \n\nWhile our study highlights the potential of L-arginine-based nanoparticles, the absence of in vivo validation remains a limitation. Future studies should involve animal models to validate these findings and assess pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, and long-term safety. Additionally, clinical trials will be essential to evaluate efficacy and tolerability in human subjects. The synthesis and application of nanoparticles raise significant environmental and ethical concerns. Our study incorporated green chemistry principles by adopting ecofriendly solvents and minimizing waste during nanoparticle synthesis, aiming to reduce the environmental footprint. \n\nAlthough this is a step towards sustainable practices, the potential systemic effects and long-term toxicity of nanoparticles composed of different excipients warrant further exploration. Nanoparticles, depending on their composition, may exhibit varying degrees of biocompatibility or adverse systemic effects, including inflammation, oxidative stress, and cytotoxicity 57 . For instance, lipid-based nanoparticles, are generally considered biocompatible. The unique properties of lipids, such as biodegradability and biocompatibility, add to drug bioavailability through their specialized transport pathways. Hence, lipid-based particles improve gastrointestinal absorption and solubilization of poorly bioavailable drugs by facilitating selective lymphatic transport. Still, they may trigger immune responses or accumulate in the liver and spleen, leading to potential organ toxicity 59 . Studies 60,61 have reported that cationic lipid nanoparticles can be cytotoxic due to their interaction with cell membranes. However, neutral or anionic formulations, such as those used in our study, have demonstrated relatively safer profiles. \n\nTo address these concerns, future studies should evaluate the safety profiles of L-arginine encapsulated lipid nanoparticles through comprehensive in vitro and in vivo toxicological assessments. Such evaluations should include biodistribution studies to understand the fate of nanoparticles within biological systems and their potential accumulation in vital organs.",

            "text": "The direct administration of CRISPR-Cas9-based gene therapeutics into the bloodstream can result in off-target effects, damaging heathy cells and causing potentially severe side effects [63]. Furthermore, rapid in vivo metabolism can significantly reduce therapeutic efficacy [64]. To address these challenges, non-viral delivery systems have been developed, with synthetic nanomaterials gaining considerable attention for their potential in drug delivery [65]. These systems must exhibit high biocompatibility, efficient delivery, and precise targeting capabilities [66]. Additionally, they should offer high loading capacity, controlled release, and inert properties to prevent adverse interactions with the gene-editing therapeutics they carry [67]. \n\nThe selection of an appropriate delivery vehicle for CRISPR-Cas9 systems is essential to improving both effectiveness and efficiency of gene-editing therapies [68]. Recent advancements in nanotechnology have highlighted the potential of multifunctional nanocarriers in addressing these needs [69]. This chapter reviews the structural characteristics and recent developments in nonviral nanocarriers, focusing on lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), extracellular vesicles (EVs), polymeric nanoparticles, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), and mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) shown in Figure 1a. Furthermore, it summarizes the unique advantages of each type of CRISPR-Cas9 system delivery, providing an overview of their applications and potential in advance gene-editing therapeutics. LNPs are an advanced drug delivery platform designed to efficiently transport biomolecules, such as DNA and RNA, into cells. Structurally, LNPs are spherical vesicles composed of lipids with hydrophilic head groups and hydrophobic tail groups, which self-assemble into nanostructures in aqueous environments [70]. These nanostructures form due to the lipid's physicochemical properties, which reduce interactions like electrostatic repulsion and steric hindrance, thereby enhancing LNP stability. Furthermore, the inherent biocompatibility and safety of LNPs allow them to evade the innate immune system and extend their circulation time [71].",

            "text": "Nano-formulations, particularly vesicular drug delivery systems, have emerged as a promising approach to enhance the therapeutic effectiveness of diverse drugs. These innovative formulations involve enclosing drugs within minute vesicles, which are spherical structures consisting of lipid or polymer bilayers (Abdel-Mageed et al., 2021). The small size of these vehicles enables them to interact with biological systems at cellular and subcellular levels, offering numerous advantages compared to conventional drug delivery methods. By encapsulating drugs within vesicles, their stability can be improved, preventing degradation, and increasing their availability in the body. Additionally, vesicular drug delivery systems possess the ability to overcome physiological barriers like the blood-brain barrier, facilitating targeted delivery of therapeutics to specific sites. Moreover, these formulations provide controlled release properties, allowing for sustained drug release, reducing the frequency of administration, and improving patient compliance (Srivastav et al., 2023).\n\nSolid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) have emerged as a promising drug delivery system for enhancing therapeutic outcomes. These nanoparticles consist of solid lipids formulated into nanoscale structures, providing several advantages over traditional drug delivery methods. One of the key advantages of SLNs is their ability to encapsulate both hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs, offering versatility in drug delivery (Duan et al., 2020). The solid lipid matrix ensures drug stability and improves bioavailability of the encapsulated drugs. SLNs also demonstrate impressive drug targeting capabilities due to their small particle size. This enables efficient cellular uptake and facilitates targeted delivery to specific tissues or cells. Surface modifications of SLNs can further enhance their targeting ability, leading to improved therapeutic efficacy and minimized off-target effects. Controlled and sustained drug release is another significant feature of SLNs. The solid lipid matrix governs the release kinetics of drugs, resulting in a controlled and prolonged release profile. This feature is particularly advantageous for drugs requiring sustained therapeutic concentrations or those with narrow therapeutic windows. Furthermore, SLNs exhibit excellent biocompatibility and safety profiles, as they are formulated with biocompatible lipids. This ensures minimal toxicity and adverse reactions, allowing for various administration routes, such as oral, topical, parenteral, and ocular applications (Akbari",

Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been employed in nucleic acid delivery technology to treat ocular illnesses since they can pass the ocular barrier and efficiently transfect nucleic acids to various cells of the eye. The size of lipid nanocarriers determines their cellular absorption, diffusion, and biodistribution, making them an attractive platform for targeted drug administration. 104 Lipid-based nanoparticles include liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs).

The solid nature of the lipids employed in SLNs at room and body temperature ensures stability, controlled drug release, and target delivery. Because of the disorganized core made up of both solid and liquid lipids, NLCs can load more drugs than SLNs. Liposomes and solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) are very effective at delivering gene segments to target cells while simultaneously allowing for the regulated release of the drug in both in vitro and in vivo settings.

            "text": "They also have advantages such as high biocompatibility and good slow-release performance. However, they have certain disadvantages, including their low drug penetration ability, poor physical stability, and a low drug loading capacity of only 1-5%. Overall, while SLNs have satisfactory therapeutic potential, they might not be suitable for all drug delivery applications due to these limitations [126]. \n\nNLCs are second-generation lipid nanocarriers that can overcome the limitations of SLNs by improving the drug loading capacity and physical stability. NLCs are broadly classified into three types including the imperfect type, amorphous type, and multiple type. They have different degrees of lipid organization within the nanoparticles, which influences their physicochemical properties and drug-loading capabilities [127]. Lipid-drug conjugates (LDCs) and polymer-lipid hybrid NPs (PLNs) are important components of the NLC system. LDCs are lipophilic modifications of water-soluble drugs or other difficultto-deliver compounds attached to lipids through covalent conjugation, which confers drug-forming properties to the drugs. The lipid materials used for conjugation are usually fatty acids, glycerides, phospholipids, etc. LDCs resolved the issue of the extremely low encapsulation rate of water-soluble drugs by SLNs and NLCs [128]. PLNs are optimized from SLNs by introducing negatively charged polymers to form drug-polymer complexes, which are then encapsulated in hydrophobic lipid materials. Polymer-lipid hybridization is usually achieved through hydrophobic interactions, van der Waals forces, electrostatic interactions, and covalent bonding. They have the advantages of liposomes and NPs. \n\nIt was encouraging to note that a substantial number of studies based on lipid-based nanocarriers for the inhalation treatment of IPF have achieved promising results. Prostaglandin E2 (PEG2) is a powerful pro-inflammatory factor with restricted immune-inflammatory and tissue repair effects in the lungs [129]. Its effectiveness as a potential drug was assessed for the treatment of IPF [130][131][132][133].",

            "text": "At present, viral-based vectors are being used for siRNA delivery research. However, despite their high efficiency for in vivo transfection, their safety remains questionable because of their toxicity, immunogenicity, and inflammatory potential. Furthermore, they have other limitations, such as complex manufacturing processes and low cell specificity [22]. Nevertheless, recent advances in biomaterial and nanotechnology sciences have led to the development of non-viral nanocarriers as alternatives for siRNA delivery. Nanostructured delivery systems provide unique advantages, like protection from premature degradation and improved interaction with the biological environment. They also offer the possibility to enhance the absorption into a selected tissue, extend siRNA retention time, and improve cellular internalization [23].\n\nNanostructured siRNA delivery systems include a wide variety of nanocarriers, defined as submicron-sized colloidal systems (with a size below 1 \u00b5m) [24], such as inorganic nanoparticles, lipidic, and polymeric nanocarriers [25]. At present, lipid-based siRNA delivery systems are clearly the most studied non-viral vectors, with several formulations in late stage clinical trials, such as lumasiran and givosiran [26], as well as patisiran (Onpattro, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals): the first-ever siRNA therapy approved by the FDA on 10 August 2018 [27,28]. Far below in number, also some polymer-based siRNA delivery systems have reached clinical trials, such as siG12D-LODER [29], although none have been approved yet [30]. Polymeric nanocarriers can be prepared from different natural or synthetic polymers. Natural polymers have some advantages over their synthetic counterparts: they are nontoxic, cheaper, and naturally available [31] and, in contrast to inorganic nanoparticles and some synthetic polymers, they are usually biodegradable. Among polymer-based nanocarriers, those obtained from naturally occurring polysaccharides are worthy of a special mention since they are commonly considered to be highly biocompatible and non-immunogenic, placing them in the fast track as potentially commercial therapies.",

            "text": "Nanoparticles-based drug delivery systems offer an advanced and effective approach for the treatment of OSCC, providing several significant advantages over conventional therapies due to their unique properties and capabilities. These systems can encapsulate therapeutic agents, enhancing their solubility, stability, and bioavailability, which is crucial for most anticancer drugs that have poor water solubility and are prone to rapid degradation in the biological environment [10,11]. The nanoscale size of these particles allows them to penetrate tumor tissues more effectively via the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. This effect exploits the leaky vasculature and poor lymphatic drainage characteristics of solid tumors, leading to higher drug concentrations at the target site thereby reducing the exposure of drug to healthy tissues, and reducing systemic toxicity. Nanoparticles have shown the potential to encapsulate more than one chemotherapeutic drug. The biocompatibility and biodegradability of nanoparticles further ensure safety and tolerability [12][13][14]. Among different classes of nanoparticles, lipid-based nanoparticles (LNPs) emerge as a promising platform with the potential to revolutionize OSCC treatment. LNPs are composed of lipids that are naturally occurring or biologically similar, making them biocompatible and biodegradable, which minimizes the risk of toxicity and adverse effects [15]. Many anticancer drugs have poor water solubility, but LNPs can encapsulate hydrophobic drugs, improving their solubility and stability in the biological environment, which enhances their bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy. LNPs demonstrate significantly higher ability to encapsulate lipophilic drugs than other nanoparticle types. LNPs offer excellent storage stability, minimal drug leakage, and controlled drug release, rendering them highly effective nanoplatforms for the delivery of different chemotherapeutic agents [16,17]. Additionally, LNPs can be modified by complexing them with specific target ligands on their surface. This surface modification allows the active targeting of LNPs to the tumors in addition to the passive targeting mechanism [18].",

            "text": "Naked mRNA molecules are large, hydrophilic, negatively charged, and highly sensitive to nuclease degradation. Due to these characteristics, the mRNA cannot easily pass through the cell membrane and be delivered into the cytoplasm where it can be translated into immunogenic protein. To overcome these hurdles, different types of nanoparticle delivery systems have been developed to protect mRNA from degradation, as well as enable cellular uptake and endosomal escape [15]. \n\nOne of the main approaches to the formulation of mRNA is based on its complexation by electrostatic interactions with cationic components, such as lipids and polymers. Currently, LNPs are the most promising lipid-based nanoparticles used as an mRNA delivery system, as represented in the leading mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 infection [16,17]. The components of LNP formulations include an ionizable lipid, cholesterol, phospholipids, and polyethylene glycol (PEG) lipids. Despite their undeniable effectiveness, PEG lipids presented in LNP are suspected to be responsible for the manifestation of some sideeffects after administration in humans and mice [18][19][20]. Thus, the development of mRNA delivery systems without a PEGylated component or mRNA loading optimization are alternatives for obtaining new, efficient, and safer vaccinal formulations. Lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles have been widely studied as nonviral vectors for mRNA delivery [21][22][23][24][25][26]. These hybrid nanoparticles present a polymeric core/lipid shell structure which combines the stability of the hydrophobic polymer and biocompatibility of lipid bilayers [27]. Additionally, the cationic lipid shell facilitates the adsorption of negatively charged mRNA onto the surface of nanoparticles and avoids their aggregation. These hybrid nanoparticles can be prepared by conventional bulk methods in which polymeric nanoparticles are mixed with preformed liposomes or lipid solution [28]. However, the bulk method relies on a multistep procedure and tends to have high batch-to-batch variation [29].",

This kind of structure makes it possible to incorporate lipophilic drugs into lipid bilayers as well as hydrophilic drugs into the aqueous compartment. Drug release from liposomes, stability, and pharmacokinetic profiles depend on composition, size, surface charge, and drug solubility. Liposome formulations of many different drugs show a significant increase in therapeutic activity compared with non-liposomal formulations. Liposomes are mostly biocompatible and biodegradable, but also face some disadvantages including low stability, low encapsulation efficiency, and difficult scale-up [38][39][40][41][42]. \n\nPolymeric nano-and microparticles are general terms that include spheres as well as capsules. Hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs can be incorporated or entrapped into these polymeric carriers, but reaching therapeutic levels is one the most crucial issues. These Sci Pharm. 2011; 79: 705-727 kinds of drug carrier systems have proved to be more stable than liposomes both in-vivo and during storage. Their main disadvantages are that preparation methods sometimes require organic solvents and that large-scale production is rather difficult. Moreover, it is sometimes crucial to find appropriate polymers that are confirmed to be nontoxic, biodegradable and nonimmunogenic [39][40][41][42][43][44][45]. Some synthetic polymer matrices have also been suspected to exert detrimental influence on peptides and proteins incorporated during the manufacturing process [45]. \n\nSLNs were developed in the early 1990s and represent promising drug carrier systems, especially in terms of mediating a sustained-release profile of the incorporated API. SLNs are in the submicron size range (50-1000 nm) and built from a lipidic matrix being solid at room temperature. They seem to represent an alternative drug carrier system to liposomes and polymeric nanoparticles.",

Nanotechnology can be divided into two major types, nanomaterials and nanodevices. Nanomaterials act as nano-sized lipophilic carriers that help in drug transport across BBB. They can be again further classified according to chemical property as nanostructured and nanocrystalline particles. Nanostructured particles are microstructured particles whose size is typically in the range between 1-10 nm. They can be of three types, polymer-based, non-polymer based and lipid-based nanostructured materials. Polymer-based nanoparticles include PNPs, dendrimers, micelles, protein nanoparticles, nanogels and drug conjugates. Lipid-based nanoparticles include liposomes and SLNs. Polymer-based and SLNs have wide application in the clinical sector. Nonpolymer based nanoparticles include carbon nanotube, metallic nanoparticles, Nanodiamond, quantum dots and silica-based nanoparticles. They are mainly intended for photodynamic applications and in the diagnosis of disease based on their structure. 139 Nanocrystalline are materials with single or multiple phase polycrystals with an order of 1-10 nm. These nanomaterials have their own merits and demerits, which still challenge nanomedicine from being a standard therapeutic approach. 140 Novel nanosized drug delivery systems and some of the examples have been enlisted in Table 1. \n\nPolymeric nanoparticles PNP, composed of natural or synthetic polymers is a promising approach for CNS drug delivery due to their non-toxicity, biocompatibility, biodegradable nature and non-immunogenicity. 141 To lower the adverse effects and high immunogenicity of synthetic polymers, such as polylactic acid, polyester forms can be used. Natural polymers like chitosan and gelatin are more effective than synthetic polymers because of their less immunogenicity and adverse effects. 142 PNPs composed of a matrix system in which it is dispersed uniformly.

            "text": "Alongside lipid-based nanoparticles, polymeric nanoparticles were demonstrated to be an effective and safe drug delivery system, though for clinical applications, the toxicity profile of polymeric particles needs to be critically assessed. Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) is a synthetic polymer that shows potential for clinical applications due to its biocompatibility, biodegradability, and low immunogenicity profile. Despite its promise, few PLGA-based medications are currently approved for clinical use [287]. Variations in product design may underlie the low success rate of PLGA nanospheres on the market. Since minor alterations in the production process may alter the pharmacodynamics of the desired product, a strong emphasis needs to be placed on the optimization of particle properties [288]. PLGA particles consist of polymerized lactic acid and glycolic acid subunits. The proportion of lactic acid to glycolic acid determines the hydrophobicity of the particle, with higher proportions of lactic acid conferring a higher degree of hydrophobicity. Simultaneously, lactic-acid-rich PLGA particles degrade slower than particles relatively high in glycolic acid, though particles with equal amounts of lactic acid and glycolic acids degrade the fastest [289,290]. The therapeutic effectiveness of PLGA particles depends on their physicochemical properties, drug loading efficiency, and drug release behavior, which altogether determine successful drug delivery. Biodistribution and (immune) clearance of PLGA nanoparticles are largely determined by their size and surface charge (zeta potential) [291]. Properly designed PLGA particles demonstrated improved delivery of therapeutics in vivo. For example, the incorporation of the chemotherapeutic docetaxel in pegylated PLGA particles showed minimal liver accumulation in rats, enhanced accumulation in tumors in mice, and induced tumor shrinkage in humans at a lower dose than when free docetaxel was administered [292].\n\nPLGA particles are tested as vehicles to induce immune tolerance in experimental models of MS. Inhibition of the inflammatory phenotype of autoreactive T cells and a delay in disease onset were achieved by injecting PLGA particles containing myelin oligodendrocyte gly",

We explored the dynamical equilibrium between LNPs components and the surroundings throughout their destiny, from formulation to release. On the basis of this, we delve deep into manufacturing challenges, scalability issues, and regulatory hurdles, associated with the clinical translation of LNP technology. Within the framework focusing on the programmability in each domain, we prioritized patient-centric factors like dosing regimens, administration techniques, and potential consequences. Notably, this review expands to innovative anatomical routes, such as intranasal and intraocular administration, offering a thorough examination of the advantages and disadvantages of each route.

For example, although gold shell-silica nanoparticles were developed in the 1990s, it took about two decades for this technology to advance into clinical trials. Organic nanoparticles, such as liposomes and lipid nanoparticles, have been successfully translated into clinical applications. However, compared with organic nanoparticles, silica nanoparticles have several advantages, which warrant further clinical studies; for example, by modulating their structural and physiochemical properties, such as size, charge, surface functionality and shape, silica nanoparticles can deliver drugs across biological barriers. Moreover, they can easily be hybridized with other inorganic particles, such as gold nanoparticles. Silica nanoparticles also possess self-adjuvant properties, which is desirable for the development of next-generation nanovaccines 2 . In addition, silica nanoparticles are stable in harsh biological settings, for example, in the acidic environment of the stomach, in which liposomes usually degrade, limiting their applicability in oral delivery 2 . Consequently, silica nanoparticles with good safety, efficacy and viability may be applicable in more diverse clinical scenarios than their organic counterparts.\n\nBased on their performance in clinical trials, silica nanoparticles are emerging as a promising diagnostic and delivery platform and could play a key role in the development of next-generation theranostics, nanovaccines and formulations to orally deliver peptides and proteins. However, key hurdles that remain to be C o m m e n t  overcome for silica nanoparticles' clinical translation include establishing safety from chronic exposure, establishing long-term toxicological profiles from different routes of administration, investigating reliable scale-up methods and synthesizing reproducible silica nanoparticles with minimal batch-to-batch variation. Moreover, only solid silica nanoparticles without pores or with small pores have been clinically tested thus far.

While they have slight differences in composition and structure, these lipidbased nanoformulations generally encapsulate a variety of pharmaceutical cargos within a protective, outer layer of lipids. Liposomes are bilayer or multilayer lipid vesicles in which an aqueous volume is entirely enclosed by a membrane composed of amphiphilic phospholipids (29)(30)(31)(32). They are composed of phospholipid molecules which are able to self-assemble into a lipid bilayer or multilayer vesicles in an aqueous environment (33). During this process, the liposomes can selectively load therapeutic agents by entrapping hydrophilic molecules in the aqueous core and hydrophobic molecules in the lipid bilayer (34). LNP consist of a solid lipid core, manufactured from either solid lipids or a mixture of liquid and solid lipids (35). Such structures were especially engineered toward encapsulating nucleic acids (such as RNA and DNA), therefore LNP are the most popular non-viral gene delivery system (36). Liposomes and LNP drug delivery systems have many advantages over systemic drug delivery (37). They can prevent unwanted degradation of drug and reduce exposure to healthy cells (38). This in turn increases biodistribution and payload of drug at target sites (39). Moreover, these systems are less toxic compared with other nanoparticles due to their biocompatible and bio-degradable characteristics (40,41). \n\nBoth liposomes and LNP can be engineered to enter cancer cells via a passive or active targeting strategy (42). \n\nPassive targeting relies on the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect which means well-vascularised tumors exhibit discontinuous endothelial cell lining (43). This leaky endothelium can be used as an access point by nanoparticles smaller than 150 nm in size (44).",

            "text": "In the past two decades, polymeric NPs and liposomes have emerged as two dominant classes of nanocarriers in the field of targeted drug delivery due to their high efficiency of drug encapsulation and site-specific delivery (Zhang et al. 2008). However, these NPs are fraught with the problem of short circulation time, drug leakage, and non-specific targeting. \n\nTo overcome these limitations, a new-generation delivery system has been developed by hybridizing both polymeric NPs and liposomes: lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles (LPHNPs). This robust hybrid nanocarrier displayed high encapsulation efficiency, sustained-release kinetics, good serum stability, and sensitivity to triggered release. As its name indicates, LPHNPs combine the characters of both liposomes and polymeric NPs. The structure consists of three layers: The innermost layer is a drug-encapsulating polymeric core, followed by a monolayer of lipid surrounding the core, and the outermost layer is the PEG layer acting as a stabilizer for prolonged systemic circulation of LPHNPs (Mukherjee et al. 2019). The most common polymer used for core preparation is poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) because of its biocompatibility and excellent biodegradability. Its unique core is highly flexible to modulation so that a variety of drugs can be loaded. Several types of lipids can be used to fabricate the NP outer shell with lecithin, cholesterol, DPPC along with PEG for surface modification (Guo et al. 2011). Studies have focused on treating GBM by modifying the surface with various targeting ligands. In a recent study, lipid-coated polymeric NPs were modified with RGD as a targeting peptide (Shi et al. 2015). The core was made up of PLGA and loaded with DTX. Synthesized nanoformulations displayed good physicochemical characteristics with size 110 \u00b1 13.5 nm and 77% drug entrapment efficiency. A 4.13-fold increased anti-proliferative activity was shown by RGD-NP compared with PLGA-NPs in C6 glioma cells.",

            "text": "In terms of clinical development, LNP (lipid nanoparticle, in earlier reports also known as SNALP, stabilized nucleic acid lipid particle) is probably the most successful RNA nanocarrier studied up to date [59]. Many clinical trials of LNP for a range of diseases have been conducted (Table 1). In essence, this system has integrated many of the aforementioned strategies to address multiple issues associated with RNA delivery, including limited in vivo circulation, inefficient transfection, and unacceptable toxicity. A LNP, typically 120 nm in diameter or smaller, is prepared using a spontaneous vesicle formation method. The nanocarrier is composed of a combination of neutral lipids (e.g. cholesterol and 1, 2-distearoylsn-glycero-3-phosphocholine), cationic lipids, and PEG-conjugated lipids [60]. Interestingly, a recent study indicated that LNP has a solid core, electron-dense complex structure with physico-chemical properties that totally different from liposomes, even it containing ingredients that are often seen in liposomes. [61]. It was suggested that by careful optimization of the choice and ratio of the various ingredients, LNP can achieve extended circulation, effective endosomal escape rate without triggering excessive production of cytokines. \n\nThe performance of LNPs in vivo and in clinical settings has been extensively evaluated. In animals, it was shown that there was no significant complement activation, pro-inflammatory cytokine production, delayed coagulation, or other changes in haematology parameters [62]. In a Phase I clinical trial evaluating LNP delivering siRNA against apolipoprotein B, no signs of hepatotoxicity were detected. Unfortunately, flu-like symptoms likely associated with immunostimulation by the high siRNA payload was observed in one of the subjects treated at the highest dose level. The manufacturer (Tekmira) therefore decided to terminate the trial early [63]. In brief, LNPs demonstrate excellent potential for RNA deliv- ery, but more toxicity data, especially related to the immunogenicity, are still needed to validate their clinical value [61].",

            "text": "Hence, rapidly evolving nanotechnology has the ability to address the intricate and multifaceted mechanisms of MDR, allowing nanomedicine to offer a novel and promising approach to combat and conquer chemoresistance against breast cancer. With the rapid growth of nanotechnology over the last 30 years, numerous nanomaterials have been developed, but only a few nanocarrier-based systems are being used in nanomedicine, and even fewer can fulfill the approval criteria of the US FDA [15]. The nanocarrier system can be broadly classified as lipid-based, polymeric, inorganic, and a hybrid of lipid and polymeric nanoparticles (Figure 3) [10][11][12][13]15,16,18]. The lipid-based nanocarriers have been proved to be superior over polymeric and inorganic nanocarriers in terms of biocompatibility, safety, and biodegradability. Lipid nanocarrier drug delivery system can be sub-categorized into nanoemulsion, self-nano emulsifying drug delivery system (SNEDDS), liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN), and nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC). In SNEDDS and nanoemulsion (oil-in-water), the modifying agent such as probes or imaging agents and lipophilic anticancer drugs are enclosed in oil droplets for specific tumor site delivery. In liposomes, the imaging/diagnostic agent can be enclosed with anticancer therapeutics either in an aqueous core or lipid bilayer according to their physicochemical characteristics (hydrophilicity/lipophilicity). Solid matrix lipid nanoparticles such as SLN (composed of solid lipid only) and NLC (composed of both solid and liquid lipid) entrapped the lipophilic therapeutics and imaging agents into the lipid phase of this delivery system. The various attributes of liposomes (like unique structure, and great flexibility to accommodate both hydrophilic and lipophilic therapeutic/imaging agents) make it promising therapeutic/imaging compared to other lipidic nanocarrier systems.",

Liposomes, SLNs, and NLCs are useful tools in the lipid-based approach, and methods like double emulsion-solvent evaporation and single emulsification show promise for the controlled synthesis of PNPs. Interestingly, in addition to helping transport drugs, inorganic nanoparticles may also have antiinflammatory and antioxidant qualities that may reduce the complications associated with diabetes. \n\nEven though there has been a lot of development, further study is necessary to improve nanoparticles systems, handle any safety issues, and convert preclinical results into clinical uses. Scalability, long-term safety profiles, and regulatory obstacles must all be addressed if this technology is to reach its full potential. However, the current developments show promise for the use of nanotechnology to provide effective and individualized diabetes management in the future. This could lead to better treatment outcomes, fewer complications from diabetes, and eventually, a higher standard of living for the millions of people who suffer from this chronic illness.",

            "text": "In the design of nanocarriers for the delivery of anticancer agents, the most commonly used matrices are polymers and lipids, each of them with specific advantages associated with their use [1]. Among the polymeric nanosystems, we distinguish mainly polymeric NPs, polymeric micelles and polymer-drug conjugates, while among the lipid-based nanosystems we distinguish liposomes, solid lipid NPs and nanostructured lipid vectors [2]. Lipid-based nanocarriers offer several advantages such as a low production cost, greater trapping efficiency of the therapeutic agent, however they tend to display a reduced stability, a fast load release and high polydispersity [3]. In addition, there is a limited possibility for the chemical modification/functionalization of these nanostructures, thus reducing their application for active targeting approaches [4]. Polymeric nanosystems, on the other hand, are characterized by a high possibility of chemical modifications, an essential feature in the development of personalized therapies [5]. In addition, polymeric NPs offer other advantages such as the possibility of obtaining NPs of small dimensions and with reduced polydispersity, as well as diversity in the synthesis procedures, simple and reproducible synthesis process, and better stability [6]. However, polymeric nanosystems also display limitations, such as the use of organic solvents in the synthesis process, the toxicity linked to the degradation products of the polymer and the limited trapping capacity of drugs [7]. A new generation of nanosystems has been created to exploit the advantages of both polymeric systems and lipid-based systems, thanks to the production of a hybrid system composed of a polymeric core coated by a lipid shell, named lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles (LPHNPs) [8]. Such systems combine the advantages of lipid-based nanocarriers, such as increased drug carrying capacity, biomimetic nature and biocompatibility, with the advantages of polymeric nanocarriers such as desirable drug release profile and variety of surface chemical functionalization/modification.",

            "text": "Nanoparticles serve as effective carriers for delivering encapsulated drugs into organisms through cell membranes via endocytosis [87] . Among various nanoparticles, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are extensively utilized as nanocarriers for delivering drugs and nucleic acids, owing to their straightforward preparation, convenient surface modification, and favorable biocompatibility [88] . In numerous investigations centered around the transportation of CRISPR/Cas9 utilizing LNPs, scientists are persistently working towards the development of delivery systems that are both more effective and safer. In terms of safety, Suzuki et al. [89] successfully constructed an LNPmediated RNP delivery platform by optimizing the synthesis conditions. This platform enabled gene destruction and base substitution, thereby avoiding issues related to DNA cleavage and high concentrations of Cas enzymes, with minimal cytotoxicity. Additionally, Wei et al. [90] demonstrated that LNPs could effectively transport RNPs to specific cells and tissues through rational design. Overall, ionizable cationic liposomes, zwitterionic phospholipids, cholesterol, and PEG liposomes are essential components of traditional liposome formulations. Building upon this foundation, the inclusion of permanent cationic lipids helps maintain the fundamental tertiary structure and stability of RNPs. Moreover, by utilizing low-dose intravenous injection, organ-specific cancer models can be efficiently established in the lung and liver of mice ( Fig. 6 A). Liu et al. [91] . developed a novel delivery method for CRISPR/Cas9 by encapsulating Cas9 mRNA and sgRNA into disulfide-integrated bio-reducible LNPs (BAMEA-O16B). These LNPs exhibited a high release efficiency of Cas9 mRNA and sgRNA when exposed to the intracellular environment, thereby enabling successful gene editing. In vitro experiments demonstrated the ability of these nanoparticles to achieve up to 90% reduction in GFP expression in cells and 80% reduction in PCSK9 expression.",

M\u00fcller, and professor M. Gascon from Italy [108].Lipid nanoparticles can be made of only solid lipids or both solid and liquid lipids [108].The main lipids used in these nanoparticles are free fatty acids, fatty alcohols, triglycerides, steroids, and waxes [107,108].Phospholipids, glycolipids, and sphingolipids are included as well [107].Lipid particles are popular in drug delivery due to their biodegradability and biocompatibility, very low toxicity profile, increasing the drug solubility, and release in a controlled profile [108].Lipid nanoparticles vary in different ways, and the main parameters in their characterization are the size, zeta potential, crystallinity rate, polymorphism, drug loading, and drug release [108].In the case of NRG encapsulation for delivery, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs), and liposomal formulations are being used [108,113].\n\nM\u00fcller et al. introduced SLNs for the first time in 1991 [80].SLNs are the first lipid nanoparticles made of solid lipids that are stabilized by emulsifiers [108].SLNs have submicron sizes (<1000 nm).Compared to polymers, liposomes, and emulsions, they have some advantages such as low toxicity, no need to use organic solvents, controlled release of drugs, decreased chemical degradation, and low cost.Nevertheless, their crystalline structure decreases drug solubility and induces instability [80,108].",

            "text": "To deliver ASOs to the target site by different routes of administration, nanocarriers of cationic polymers are usually preferred because of their ability to form polyelectrolyte complexes by facilitating ionic interactions between the positively charged functional groups and the negatively charged phosphate fraction [38]. The form of nucleic acids in nanocarriers is complex. ASOs can be encapsulated in the matrix of the nanocarrier or attached to the surface of the carrier by covalent or ionic bonding. Lipid-based nanoparticle (LNP) systems are one of the most promising colloidal nanocarriers for bioactive organic molecules. LNPs for the delivery of ASOs (LNPs-ASOs) typically consist of ionizable cationic lipids, phospholipids, polyethylene glycol (PEG) lipids, and cholesterol due to the negatively charged nature of nucleic acids [39][40][41]. PEG-series materials are structurally similar, but each has a specific structure and unique function (Fig. 3). The LNP-based delivery platform is appreciated as an advanced virus-free delivery system for ASOs for the treatment of a range of diseases [42]. Hitherto three LNP-based RNA drugs have been approved by the FDA, including two COVID-19 mRNA vaccines that play an irreplaceable role in preventing the spread of epidemics [43,44]. LNPs have a suitable particle size (diameter range of 10-500 nm) combined with their own biocompatible and biodegradable lipids, which enables LNPs-ASOs to escape uptake by the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS), subsequently prolonging the circulation time of LNPs-ASOs and allowing the particles to passively and efficiently target cells through an enhanced permeability and retention effect to release ASOs [45][46][47].",

Another clinically approved ionizable lipid is MC3, which serves as a key component of Onpattro [34]. In preclinical studies, many ionizable lipids, such as C12-200 [38], cKK-E12 [39], TT3 [40], 306Oi10 [41], and CAP2 [42], have been developed with specific functions. Helper phospholipids, on the other hand, are instrumental in wrapping nucleic acids and are considered to be a backbone of the lipid bilayers. Typical phospholipids include DSPC, DOPE, DOTC, DOTMA, and POPC. Among them, DSPC has been in clinics as a key component in the COVID-19 vaccines [43]. Another helper lipid is cholesterol, which is utilized in LNPs for structural integrity. Interestingly, cholesterol derived lipids have shown improved mRNA delivery and certain tissue targeting, highlighting the adaptability of the geometry of cholesterol [44,45]. Lastly, PEG-modified lipids play a crucial role in regulating cellular uptake and prolonging circulation half-life in vivo. PEG-lipids, such as PEG2000-DMG and PEG2000-DSG, prevent nanoparticle aggregation and adsorption of serum proteins, which is critical for maintaining the stability of LNPs during storage and circulation [46]. \n\nCurrently, the field of high-throughput screening for LNPs is rapidly advancing to meet the growing demand for drug delivery. This screening process aims to identify the most effective lipid combinations to enhance the stability, delivery efficiency, and biocompatibility of LNPs. For instance, researchers are leveraging combinatorial libraries to systematically generate and test a vast array of lipid formulations [34,[47][48][49]. This approach allows them to explore numerous lipid combinations efficiently.",

            "text": "Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a highly malignant and invasive tumor with significant mortality and morbidity. Current treatment modalities such as surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy encounter significant limitations, such as poor targeting, systemic toxicity, and drug resistance. There is an urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies that offer targeted delivery, enhanced efficacy, and reduced side effects. The advent of lipid-based nanoparticles (LNPs) offers a promising tool for OSCC therapy, potentially overcoming the limitations of current therapeutic approaches. LNPs are composed of biodegradable and biocompatible lipids, which minimize the risk of toxicity and adverse effects. LNPs can encapsulate hydrophobic drugs, improving their solubility and stability in the biological environment, thereby enhancing their bioavailability. LNPs demonstrate significantly higher ability to encapsulate lipophilic drugs than other nanoparticle types. LNPs offer excellent storage stability, minimal drug leakage, and controlled drug release, making them highly effective nanoplatforms for the delivery of chemotherapeutic agents. Additionally, LNPs can be modified by complexing them with specific target ligands on their surface. This surface modification allows the active targeting of LNPs to the tumors in addition to the passive targeting mechanism. Furthermore, the PEGylation of LNPs improves their hydrophilicity and enhances their biological half-life by reducing clearance by the reticuloendothelial system. This review aims to discuss current treatment approaches and their limitations, as well as recent advancements in LNPs for better management of OSCC.",

However, scientific studies on the biological fate of orally administered LNPs are limited, and absorption mechanisms through the intestinal lumen into the circulation remain unclear [43]. Liposomes are the earliest models of developed lipid-based carriers described as nontoxic, biocompatible, flexible, and fully biodegradable [44]. They are essentially composed of phospholipid bilayer vesicles, including phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, the most popular phospholipids found in nature, with other membrane bilayer components, such as cholesterol and hydrophilic polymers around each liposomal vesicle [45]. A TQ-loaded liposome (TQ-LP) with entrapment efficiency of 90% was prepared by using the conventional thin-film hydration technique via 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine phospholipids showing cytotoxicity against T47D and MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines with little effect on the normal cells [46].

New nanostructured drug delivery systems, using materials such as liposomes, polymeric drug conjugates, polymeric micelles, and solid lipid nanoparticles, can overcome these challenges. \u22126 Recently, the encapsulation of iron oxide nanoparticles, within a suitable coating for inorganic drug delivery systems, has been reported as beneficial due to the prevention of particle aggregation in vitro and in vivo as well as the possibility for loading therapeutic molecules. The external surface of magnetic nanoparticle matrices can contain hydrophilic polymeric chains, or targeting ligands, for passive and/or active targeting of cancer tissues/cells. The biocompatible and biodegradable coating materials used in these core/ shell nanoparticle systems usually consist of a polymeric material or a lipid-based structure. In this case, coating the surface of magnetic nanoparticles with solid lipid structures has provided good biomedical results. These matrixes, such as solid lipid nanoparticles, are biocompatible, biodegradable, and welltolerated materials and so have found promising applications in drug delivery. 7 y loading the magnetic particles into the SLNs, the drug reaches the tumor area by directing the magnetic field. Thus, toxicity and drug dosages are reduced, and validity, reliability, and patient compliance are greatly improved. In many cases, lipophilic drugs with good compatibility with the lipid matrix are chosen for loading into SLNs. 5 everal studies were carried out by many research groups. In one of them, Hsu and Su tried to produce a prototype applicable in the field of magnetic temperature control medicine, in order to control hyperthermia of lipid particles, by encapsulating a lipophilic drug and iron oxide particles into lipid nanoparticles. 8 In another study, Grillone et al. loaded magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles with sorafenib, an anticancer drug, and encapsulated it in solid lipid nanoparticles.",

            "text": "Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) can be defined as colloidal drug carriers with diameter size ranging from 50 nm to 1 \u03bcm. They are made up of solid lipids or mixture of different liquid and solid lipids stabilized with the aid of an emulsifier. The lipids generally used for the preparation of SLNs consist of physiological lipids like waxes, fatty acids, triglycerides, and steroids, which are biocompatible and thus can be well tolerated by the body. SLNs exhibit advantages over liposomes like improved stability of drug-loaded nanoparticles due to emulsion-based stabilization. SLNs offer other properties like the controlled release, incorporation of hydrophilic and lipophilic drug, target-based release, easy manufacturing, controllable particle size, easy scale-up, and reduced toxicity. These beneficial properties of SLNs have attracted researchers to evaluate its potential for targeted drug delivery. SLNs exhibit the potential of active targeting by means of surface modification with ligands and passive targeting by enhanced permeation and retention effect owing to their small size. However, for efficient incorporation of hydrophilic molecules, some amphiphilic substances need to be incorporated. SLNs have also found to provide protection to the incorporated drug molecules from physical, chemical, and enzymatic degradations. SLNs also have been found to exhibit enhanced bioavailability, improved pharmacokinetic profiles, and localized drug delivery to diseased sites in the lungs, thereby enhancing therapeutic efficiency and reducing side effects. \n\nThe potential of paclitaxel-loaded solid lipid nanoparticles for improved delivery to lung tumors was evaluated by Rosi\u00e8re et al. [35]. It was reported that in vivo pulmonary delivery of coated SLNs exhibited prolonged exposure of paclitaxel in the lungs and reduced systemic delivery, thereby demonstrating that this strategy might enhance the antitumor activity. Another study performed by Ji et al. [36] presented the encapsulation of hydrophobic drug naringenin into solid lipid nanoparticles using emulsification and low-temperature solidification method.",

            "text": "The effectiveness of the oral administration of the active ingredients and biomolecules depends on the degree of their degradation in the severely acid environment of the stomach. The use of nanoparticles in recent years as a new scientific model has gained significant importance in various fields due to their unique properties, which contribute to the increased involvement of science and technology [24]. Nanomedicine has provided new approaches to improve oral delivery of drugs with poor solubility, low stability and bioavailability, and various administration restrictions [25]. Nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) are the latest-generation colloidal nanoparticles with improved stability and drug-loading efficiency. The lipids used in NLC preparation are usually physiological (biocompatible and biodegradable) [26]. Therefore, it has become vital to understand nanoparticles' impact on human health and the environment [27]. \n\nThe safety and biological interactions of nanomaterials are investigated using nanotoxicology. Thus, as nanotechnology advances, understanding the biological repercussions of nanoparticles becomes crucial. Preclinical nanotoxicology tests collect information on toxicity testing (single-dose and repeated-dose) of lipid nanoparticles [28] loaded with active pharmaceutical ingredients. \n\nLaboratory rodents (rats, mice, rabbits) and carnivores are most commonly used in toxicity studies. The trend toward limiting animal experimentation has led to the development of \"alternative methods\" for toxicity testing on cell cultures, tissues, or embryos. However, these alternative methods cannot completely replace traditional live animal tests, with some disadvantages related to the culture survival time, the choice of revealing toxicity parameters, and the fact that cell culture is an isolated system. A preclinical, experimental model of menopause can be obtained in three ways: (1) using temporal (natural) aging (\"model of aging menopausal rat females\") [29]; (2) pharmacological (chemical castration using ovotoxin) [30]; (3) surgical, via ovarectomy [30,31].",

The characteristics of LNPs are suitable for drug and vaccine delivery applications because of their enhanced biodistribution, biocompatibility, biodegradability, high cellular uptake, long half-life, and ease of synthesis. Phospholipids enhance the ability of LNPs in endosomal escape. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) and cholesterols improve stability and shelf-life. Therefore, LNPs are promising nonviral delivery carriers. \n\nIn this review, the types of LNPs, their synthesis techniques, formulations, triggered releases, and potential in vaccine applications are summarized (Fig. 1). 13  Nucleic acids for therapeutics and vaccine applications DNA and RNA are two linear polymers responsible for carrying all the genetic information of organisms. DNA is a doublestranded molecule that is much larger than a single-stranded RNA molecule. Their structures have similarities: they have a sugar backbone, phosphates, and nucleobases. However, the sugar in a DNA molecule is deoxyribose, whose number of hydroxyl groups is one less than that of ribose in RNA. DNA is more stable than RNA because of the lack of one oxygencontaining hydroxyl group, double-stranded nature, possession of a damage response and repair mechanisms, and presence of histone proteins. 18 DNA stability is necessary to maintain all the genetic information of organisms through evolution. Although DNA and RNA have a phosphate group and a sugar molecule, RNA carries the nucleobase uracil instead of the nitrogenous base thymine in DNA. \n\nTargeted DNA or RNA inhibition, which consequently inhibits the expression of a protein responsible for a certain disease, underlines the common aim of all nucleic acid-based therapeutics except gene therapy (Fig. 2). 19,20",

            "text": "Lipid-based nanoparticles have been the most common class of nanomedicines approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [44]. Lipid-based nanoparticles are excellent platforms for the encapsulation of diverse hydrophobic or hydrophilic therapeutics, including small molecules, proteins, and nucleic acids. Their multiple advantages include formulation and synthesis simplicity, self-assembly, biocompatibility, and high bioavailability [45]. Common fabrication techniques for lipid-based nanocarriers are highpressure homogenization, high-speed stirring, ultrasonication, emulsion/solvent evaporation, double emulsion, phase inversion, and solvent injection [46]. \n\nLipid-based NPs are divided into several types of systems: liposomal NPs, composed of a lipid bilayer enclosing a hydrophilic core; lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), liposome-like structures with diverse morphologies that usually form an inverse micelle within the core to encapsulate hydrophilic agents; and solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNPs) composed of a lipid monolayer enclosing a solid lipid core [47]. Gene delivery systems often use LNPs to encapsulate nucleic acids in spherical vesicles composed of several materials: ionizable or cationic lipids, helper lipids, and polyethylene glycol (PEG) [48]. Ionizable lipids, which are neutral at physiological pH and positively charged at low pH, are embedded in the micellar structure of LNPs to complex with negatively charged genetic material, aid endosomal escape, and protect against nuclease-mediated degradation [49,50]. Helper lipids such as distearoylphosphatidylcholine and cholesterol, promote cell membrane binding and provide structural rigidity. Because LNPs can be rapidly taken up by the reticuloendothelial system, PEG is commonly used to decorate the NP surface to increase bioavailability in the human body [51].",

Nanoparticles have improved pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of therapeutic agents there by diminishing toxicity by their preferential accumulation at the target site. In addition, they improve therapeutic potential of drugs by facilitating intracellular delivery and prolonging their retention time either inside the cell or in blood circulation [1,2].\n\nNanoparticles can be categorized into three groups: Inorganic nanoparticles, solid lipid nanoparticles and polymer nanoparticles. Inorganic nanoparticles are the generic term for several nanoparticles such as gold and magnetic nanoparticles. Solid lipid nanoparticles combine the advantages but avoiding the disadvantages of other colloidal carriers such as emulsions, liposomes and polymeric microparticles and nanoparticles. Polymer nanoparticles involve various natural or biocompatible synthetic polymers [1,3,4].\n\nPolymer therapeutics is a family of compounds and drug delivery technologies that uses water-soluble polymers as a common core component. One of the biggest advantages of using these polymers in drug delivery is the capability to manipulate their properties such as molecular weight, linkers and many more to adapt to the drug delivery requirements. They can be subdivided into several groups: polymer drugs, polymeric -protein conjugates, polymer drug conjugates, multicomponent polyp lexes being developed as non-viral vectors, polymer micelles and dendrimers [2,3].\n\nPolymer-protein conjugates using polyethylene glycol (PEG) called PEGylation as polymer component are currently the most advanced class of polymer therapeutics. They are developed to avoid some of the drawbacks of peptide, protein and antibody-based drugs like a short half-life, poor stability and solubility, increased clearance by the reticuloendothelial system (RES) and immunogenicity.

At the same time, the physical characteristics of LNPs, like particle size, morphology, encapsulation rate, and surface charge are prone to be regulated, thus producing a variety of different LNP formulations (Yang et al., 2022;Suzuki and Ishihara, 2021). Ionizable lipid nanoparticles display excellent biocompatibility, high nucleic acid encapsulation efficiency, and efficient transfection performance, releasing only under specific circumstances with low off-target effects (Yang et al., 2022). Nowadays, LNPs have become the most widely explored and applied non-viral nucleic acid delivery vector (Sun and Lu, 2023). Now the focus is on how to improve the delivery effect of LNPs. Modifying the surface of LNPs with targeted molecular entities becomes the most popular way (Subhan et al., 2023). In principle, peptides, antibodies, or proteins that target specific cell surface molecules are added to nanoparticles carrying mRNA to block liver accumulation and enable particular mRNA transport to target cells through high-affinity binding (Kedmi et al., 2018;FIGURE 4 The Delivery mechanism of lipid nanoparticles (Suzuki and Ishihara, 2021). First, the lipid nanoparticles (LNP) completely encapsulated the RNA and prevented it from nuclease digestion. LNPs are neutral in physiological pH due to ionizable lipids and pegylated phospholipids, thus reducing non-specific interactions with serum proteins. Second, LNPs are taken up by cells via apolipoprotein E (ApoE) dependent and/or ApoE independent pathways when the pegylated phospholipids are dissociated. Finally, the protonated LNPs, after acidification in the endosomes, induce the hexagonal phase structure, destroy the cell membrane, and release RNA molecules into the cytoplasm.

In this regard, liposomes represent one of the most used lipid DDS despite their low physical and chemical stability [24].\n\nAn alternative to them can be offered by SLNs, formed by biocompatible and biodegradable lipids that are solid at body temperature, making SLNs promising robust nanocarriers for controlled drug delivery [25].\n\nApart from the abovementioned low toxicity and high stability, SLNs present other interesting advantages, for instance, their high biocompatibility and biodegradability, and the remarkable capacity to incorporate both hydrophilic and lipophilic compounds. In addition, they enable a controlled release of the incorporated drug and they provide chemical protection and, therefore, high stability to the incorporated compound [7]. Liquid crystal nanoparticles (LCNPs) also share these advantageous characteristics and are also considered as very promising nanocarriers [17,26]. However, LCNPs have not been widely applied yet, because of the high costs associated with the massive energy input required in the manufacturing process [16].\n\nIn this regard, SLNs allow for simple and economical large-scale production [10,27], being some of the most applied preparation methods microemulsion and high-pressure homogenization [6].\n\nAnother advantage of SLNs is the wide diversity of routes through which their administration is effective: oral, parenteral, rectal, nasal, ocular, etc. [28]. Besides, they can be applied to treat a wide range of diseases, including the use of SLNs in cancer treatment, in gene therapy by using cationic SLNs, or even in the cosmetic field [6,29].\n\nNevertheless, as mentioned before, these nanoparticles also present some disadvantages related to the recrystallization process, such as a low drug loading capacity and the possibility of drug expulsion during SLN storage.

Different types of nanoparticles have been investigated for topical delivery. The most commonly studied nanoparticles are solid lipid nanoparticles and polymeric nanoparticles, such as those made from poly(dl-lactic acid) (PLA), poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and poly-\u03b5-caprolactone (PCL) (Rancan et al., 2009). Polymeric nanoparticles can be classified as nanocapsules and nanospheres. Nanospheres have a solid matrix while nanocapsules have a shell that surrounds a core usually oily ( Figure 9). Anticancer drugs can be encapsulated inside or be associated with the nanoparticle surface. Fig. 9. Schematic representation of polymeric nanoparticles. Nanocapsules have a polymeric shell with an interior phase that is often oily. Also shown are the solid-matrix nanospheres.\n\nSolid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) have been studied since the 1990s and are considered new relative to liposomes and polymeric nanoparticles. SLNs are primarily composed of lipids, which are solid at room temperature, dispersed in water. They are similar to nanoemulsions, but the inner liquid lipid is replaced with a solid lipid (Gratieri et al., 2010). This structure can improve sustained drug release because drug mobility is lower in SLNs. When compared to liposomes, SLNs exhibit greater stability, prolonged drug release and greater ease in sterilization and in scaling the manufacturing process to an industrial level. The absence of organic solvents in the preparation of SLNs is a huge advantage compared to polymeric nanoparticles. However, low drug loading and drug expulsion during storage can be a limiting factor for some therapeutic treatments. Both SLNs and polymeric nanoparticles have been shown to promote sustained drug release and protection against drug degradation when topically applied (Teixeira et al., 2010;Marquele-Oliveira et al., 2010).

The dual advantages of the vesicular and particulate make it a promising drug carrier with high biocompatibility, stability and favorable pharmacokinetic profile [19]. Drugs could be efficiently encapsulated in the polymer core and/or between the lipid bilayers, and therefore increase the payload capability. Introduction of the polymer core might delay the diffusion of the drug and increase the stability of the lipid shell, thereby enhancing the drug EE and system stability. There are many studies developing LPNPs [20,21]. It is relatively easy to load hydrophobic drugs into LPNPs with high EE, because both the polymer core and the lipid bilayer could encapsulate drugs. However, it is challenging to achieve high EE and decent particle size when incorporating hydrophilic drugs into LPNPs. In order to solve the problems mentioned above, the main aim of this study was to develop Sal LPNPs with high drug entrapment efficiency, small particle size and increased tumor cell uptake. A modified emulsification-solvent-evaporation method was employed to prepare LPNPs. The parameters of formulation were systematically investigated. The optimal Sal loaded LPNPs (Sal-LPNPs) were comprehensively characterized. The in vitro antitumor activity of Sal-LPNPs was assessed in Sal sensitive cell lines.",

            "text": "Lipids are a class of biomacromolecules characterized by their hydrophobic or amphiphilic nature, which includes fats, sterols, phospholipids, glycerides, or fat-soluble vitamins. Their ability to form vesicles and membranes, as well as their biocompatibility and non-immunogenicity, makes them attractive candidates for the development of nanocarriers, with liposomes being one of the most greatly investigated delivery system, not only for nucleic acids but also for small molecule drugs [7,21,93]. Thus, surface engineering of inorganic nanoparticles, such as silica nanoparticles, with a lipid shell is a very well-accepted method for the production of hybrid nanosystems with synergistically combined characteristics [5,21]. Additionally, the surface of lipid-coated nanoparticles can be easily modified for the addition of targeting ligands, PEGylation, or other functional moieties, by simultaneous or postinsertion of lipid-conjugates [5]. For instance, van Schooneveld and colleagues investigated the effect of a physically adsorbed monolayer of PEGylated phospholipids on silica nanoparticles' in vitro and in vivo performance, namely short-term cytotoxicity and pharmacokinetics, and reported that the lipidic coating improved the applicability, biocompatibility, and pharmacokinetics of these nanoparticles. The PEG-lipid shell prevented silica nanoparticles from aggregating, increased blood circulation half-life time by 10-fold (165 min vs. 15 min) and resulted in a more favorable tissue distribution profile [94]. It was observed that lipid-coated nanoparticles accumulated gradually in the liver and spleen, while bare nanoparticles accumulated much faster and in a higher extent, highlighting their possible opsonins exposure and thus poorer pharmacokinetics. Additionally, bare nanoparticles accumulated in the lungs, causing breathing problems and liver necrosis, while none of that or other adverse effects were observed with coated nanoparticles [94].",

            "text": "Recently, lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles have emerged as novel mRNA delivery systems combining the advantages of biodegradable polymeric nanoparticles and liposomes (Persano et al., 2017;Islam et al., 2018;Guevara et al., 2019b). Lipidpolymer hybrid nanoparticles consist of a biodegradable mRNAloaded polymer core coated with a lipid layer (Persano et al., 2017;Islam et al., 2018;Guevara et al., 2019b). Usually, the lipid envelope is organized into a lipid bilayer or lipid monolayer containing a mixture of cationic or ionizable lipids, helper lipids, and pegylated lipid (Figure 1). \n\nLipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles, thanks to their structural design, can offer a series of benefits such as small size, high nucleic acid condensation efficiency, large functionalizable surface that can be easily modified by the binding of different functional groups, and prolonged blood circulation time (Guevara et al., 2019b). In addition, the specific physicochemical properties of hybrid lipid-polymer nanostructures can potentially result in a different interaction of the delivered mRNA with innate RNA sensors, consequently altering the immunogenicity and safety profile of lipopolyplex-based immunotherapies (Van der Jeught et al., 2018). \n\nThe above benefits of hybrid lipid-polymer formulations have been highlighted in a recent study were an mRNAloaded lipid-polymer platform functionalized with mannose receptor targeting moieties to promote dendritic cell (DC) targeting in vivo was employed (Van der Jeught et al., 2018). The formulation exhibited excellent hemocompatibility and the expression of the mRNA cargo was preferentially restricted to splenic antigen presenting cells (APCs) upon systemic administration. Furthermore, vaccination with the lipopolyplex formulation elicited a potent T-cell-mediated immune response and manifested superior effectiveness in inhibiting tumor growth compared to intravenous immunization with a lipoplex-based mRNA vaccine (Van der Jeught et al., 2018).",

Biocompatible and biodegradable lipids utilized to prepare these nanosystems have the significant ability to reduce the adverse effects of the ophthalmic preparations [38]. Compared to polymeric nanoparticles, numerous benefits are associated with lipid nanoparticles, such as modified release, excellent stability, minimum decomposition of lipids, in vivo tolerability, and adaptability to various delivery routes, which enables lipid nanoparticles as a suitable and efficient drug transporting vehicle in different delivery systems [39]. Moreover, lipid nanoparticles can encapsulate hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs, improve the bioavailability of low water-soluble actives, and protect them from premature elimination. The lipid materials typically employed to develop these nanocarriers are non-toxic, non-immunogenic and, therefore, exhibit remarkable tissue compatibility, and tolerability properties. The key distinctive feature between NLCs and SLNs is the nature of lipids included in the formulation, fluid lipids in NLCs, and solid lipids in SLNs. Over the last few decades, nanoemulsions were extensively evaluated as a delivery vehicle for hydrophobic drugs [40]. Nevertheless, the practicability of modified drug release from nanoemulsions is rather limited because of the nanosized particles and the liquid state of the nanosystems.",

Academia and industry are dedicated pushing forward in understanding the potential effects of nanomaterials on biological systems. 2][3][4] Importantly, nanoparticles (NPs) with small sizes are of high interest for drug delivery systems (DDS) to reach biological molecules/tissues/ organs, which are normally inaccessible for many synthetic pharmaceutics. Many drugs that have demonstrated efficacy in vitro and ex vivo lose beneficial effects when tested in vivo. This might be due to the difficulties related to drug delivery to the pharmacological target. 6][7][8] Moreover, NPs are DDS that protect drugs from degradation and transport them without modifying their intrinsic properties. 9 Additionally, NPs have remarkable properties, such as biodegradability, biocompatibility, non-immunogenicity, metabolic stability and high selectivity to interact with specific receptors. 10,11 3][14][15] In this work, we assessed long-term distribution and toxicity of the three of the most promising ones: liposomes, poly(lactic-coglycolic acid) (PLGA) NPs and Solid Lipid NPs (SLN). Liposomes are small spherical-shaped vesicles that can be produced from natural nontoxic phospholipids and cholesterol. 16 These amphiphilic assemblies are composed of phospholipid bilayers that are concentrically oriented around an aqueous compartment. These nanocarriers encapsulate hydrophilic or hydrophobic molecules. 17,18 iposomes vary in sizes, from small unilamellar vesicles (diameter <100 nm) to multilamellar vesicles with a mean diameter between 100 and 1000 nm. They are promising DDS, because of their small size, fluidity, permeability, hydrophobic/hydrophilic character and composition (concentration of the phospholipids). Liposomes have also the ability to fuse with cell membranes, granting the drug release into the cells.",

Due to the structural similarity between the lipids used to fabricate NP (in many cases from natural origin) and the lipids of the endothelial cells of BBB, the passage of these nanocarriers by the transcellular pathway is favored. 34 Furthermore, their high biocompatibility and low immunogenicity allow them to be rendered as the best candidates for targeting diseases of the CNS. 50 There are two main types of LNP, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) and the second generation of lipid nanoparticles, nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC). NLC present enhanced stability, higher drug loading capacity and are able to prevent drug expulsion during storage. 51 Several studies have reported anticonvulsant activity on different formulations of SLN and NLC, which are summarized below. Moreover, SLN and NLC are the two most widely studied lipid-based nanocarriers for brain pathologies, since they have the physicochemical potential to deliver drugs in the deepest brain regions. 50",

            "text": "Lipid Nanoparticles as a Novel Strategy to Deliver Bioactive Molecules Lipid nanoparticles are so far among the most successful nanodelivery systems, considering the significant proportion of marketed nanocarriers that correspond to this category. High loading capacity, biocompatibility, and environmentally friendly obtention techniques can be mentioned among their most prominent specific advantages. The current research topic on Lipid Nanoparticles as a Novel Strategy to Deliver Bioactive Molecules encompasses original and review articles on a wide range of lipid nanoparticle-related topics, from encapsulation of gene therapies to novel characterization approaches. The collection of articles also expresses the increasing versatility of these nanosystems, owing to the use of hybrid and functionalized carriers. \n\nThe review article \"Solid lipid nanoparticles for drug delivery: pharmacological and biopharmaceutical aspects\" provides a literature survey on original publications from the last 7 years, considering only those articles where pharmacodynamic and/or pharmacokinetic studies have been performed. The article focuses on biopharmaceutical aspects of nanosystems administered through different routes, from oral absorption to enhanced brain penetration, including a critical view on current uncertainties and future directions. \n\nThe article \"Surface Plasmon Resonance as a Characterization Tool for Lipid Nanoparticles used in Drug Delivery\" describes recent work on the use of surface plasmon resonance to predict the potential interactions of lipid nanoparticles with biological proteins, including constituents of the protein corona that may trigger elimination by the mononuclear phagocyte system, thus conditioning their bioavailability. \n\nFor their part, Muraca et al. reviewed the use of lipid nanosystems for the delivery of therapeutics against a group of three trypanosomatid-caused neglected diseases: African trypanosomiasis, Chagas disease, and leishmaniasis. The article \"Trypanosomatid-caused conditions: State of the art of therapeutics and potential applications of lipid-based nanocarriers\" concludes that lipid nanocarriers could improve the efficacy-safety balance of known treatments, diminishing cytotoxicity and organ toxicity, especially in the case of leishmaniasis.",

            "text": "Various types of vectors are being developed for mRNA delivery. [1,4] Common challenges of these vectors relate to increasing translation efficiency, promoting advantageous pharmacokinetic profiles with high mRNA stability, achieving tissue and cellular selectivity, and employing simple manufacturing and storage. Viral vectors have shown outstanding properties for delivering mRNA, such as in vivo application and high translation rates. [5] However, they are limited by their maximum packing size, cytotoxicity, immunogenicity and intricate manufacturing. [6] Nonviral vectors based on biocompatible materials have potential for overcoming the drawbacks of viruses through precise engineering of their nanostructure. These nonviral carriers are mainly prepared from lipids, polymers, and their combinations. [4,7] Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are at the forefront of clinical translation, showing high delivery efficiency. mRNA formulated in LNPs can be delivered to several organs and cell types, leading to a variety of therapeutic applications, for example, vaccines for cancer and infectious diseases. [1,2,8] These advanced studies have demonstrated the safety and high translation ability of lipid carriers, but also identified limitations, such as thermostability issues that correspond with expensive cold chains and logistics, [9] and in many cases tropism to the liver. [10] hile polymer-based mRNA delivery systems are less advanced in the clinic than lipids and show certain challenges, such as relatively low transfection efficiency and potential toxicities, [11] they have potential for providing unique features, such as the assembly of various nanostructures in aqueous conditions, ability of lyophilization and long-term storage, [12] and distinct pharmacokinetics that could be useful for developing advanced mRNA therapies. However, it is important to note that precise engineering of the polymers, controlled chemical structure, and high batch-to-batch reproducibility are key features for the translation of polymer-based mRNA delivery systems into therapeutics. In this regard, not all polymer-based systems may satisfy the abovementioned properties, and thus, may not be suitable for clinical application. [13] In our work, we discussed the unique strengths, advantages, and disadvantages of polymer systems.",

            "text": "Studies have suggested that the structure and pKa of the ionizable lipids play a crucial role in the delivery efficiency of the cargo to the target cells [5,18,19]. For example, Dlin-MC3-DMA, the ionizable lipid in Onpattro (Figure 1b), with a pKa of 6.44, has a 10-fold higher potency than (2,2-dilinoleyl-4-(2-dimethylaminoethyl)- [1,3]dioxolane, DLin-KC2-DMA) with a pKa of 6.7 [20,21]. However, it should be noted that subtle differences in the lipid structure can induce variations in the structural packing of LNP's, resulting in a different morphology and delivery profile. To improve the particle stability, DSPC, with two saturated acyl chains and a large head group, is incorporated into the formulation (Figure 1b). These lipids produce a cylindrical geometry and play the role of helper lipids in the LNP to maintain the outer layer structure and increase the Onpattro's formation [22]. The PEG-DMG lipids on the particle surface (Figure 1a,b) prevent particle aggregation due to stealth properties and prolong the circulation time in vivo. Altogether, this LNP system has a solid core structure, a low surface charge at physiological media, and low immunogenicity [16]. This technology has sparked interest in further developing genetic therapies and novel delivery systems. Lipid-based nanoparticles are a particularly promising vehicle [11,23,24] for gene delivery with their higher biocompatibility than polymeric and inorganic nanoparticles, their inherent penetrating ability, their biodegradability, structural flexibility, and low immunogenicity [25,26]. These nanostructures can also be produced rapidly at large scale, which is a major advantage when moving into clinical trials and commercial applications [25]. \n\nSince the success of Doxil, Onpattro, and various other LNPs in clinical trials, a myriad of studies has been conducted to translate R&D efforts into commercial products.",

            "text": "Lipid-based nanoparticles typically consist of a lipid core that contains the pharmaceutical drug (in this case, a local anesthetic) and surfactants as stabilizers. These nanoparticles can be divided into six categories based on their structure: liposomes, lipid nanoemulsions, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), niosomes, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs). 45 Liposomes are composed of a phospholipid bilayer surrounding an aqueous core, while lipid nanoemulsions consist of a lipid monolayer surrounding a liquid lipid core. Solid lipid nanoparticles are composed of a surfactant (emulsifier) layer that encloses lipids in a solid state. 46 Meanwhile, LNPs have a phospholipid monolayer, and their core consists of phospholipid molecules connected to each other and to the surfactant with the aid of oligonucleotides. 47 NLCs consist of a mixture of solid and liquid lipids, with a layer of surfactant/emulsifier covering the outside. 48 Niosomes are single-layered nonionic surfactants that encapsulate a hydrophilic core. Hydrophilic local anesthetics bind to the water-soluble regions of lipid-based nanoparticles, while lipophilic drugs bind to the hydrophobic regions that are lipid-soluble. 49 The distribution of local anesthetics within lipid-based nanoparticles is dependent on the intended site, mode and mechanism of action. Lipid-based nanomedicines offer several distinctive benefits, such as excellent biocompatibility, biodegradability, increased drug loading efficacy and stability, precise targeting of specific sites, lower toxicity, simple high-yield production, improved drug permeability at the intended site, and more.",

Enhanced drug loading capacities will be achieved through refined polymer compositions and nanoparticle formulations, while surface modifications promise improved stability. Targeted delivery mechanisms will be realized through the strategic conjugation of nanoparticles with ligands or antibodies that bind specifically to receptors on HIV-infected cells. Lipid nanoparticles will be meticulously engineered with tailored lipid compositions to enhance biocompatibility and reduce toxicity risks. Advanced encapsulation techniques and the use of lipids with superior drug solubility will further optimize drug loading capacities. Stability will be bolstered through the incorporation of stabilizers like cholesterol or PEGylation, complemented by targeted delivery facilitated by surface modifications employing ligands or antibodies designed for HIV-infected cells. \n\nInorganic nanoparticles, carefully designed with consideration for composition and surface properties, will aim to minimize potential toxicity and interactions with the immune system. Strategies including porous structures and drug incorporation into the nanoparticle matrix will enhance drug loading capacities. Targeted delivery will be achieved through conjugation with ligands or antibodies specific to HIV-infected cells. Research will additionally explore the impact of inorganic nanoparticles on HIV replication and latency, providing critical insights into their effects on the immune system. Comprehensive evaluation through rigorous in vitro and in vivo studies will assess the safety, efficacy, and targeted delivery capabilities of these innovative nanocarriers. Collaboration between experts in nanomedicine and HIV/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) research will be essential for identifying the most promising nanoparticle strategies and overcoming inherent system limitations.

            "text": "Furthermore, the inherent biocompatibility and safety of LNPs allow them to evade the innate immune system and extend their circulation time [71]. This makes LNPs particularly effective for delivering nucleic acids and hydrophobic protein-based drugs with short circulation half-lives, enabling precise therapeutic gene editing with the CRISPR-Cas9 system. \n\nThe significance of LNPs, with their ability to preserve lipid physicochemical properties in aqueous environments, became apparent with the fact that many small molecule anticancer drugs have low aqueous solubility, requiring encapsulation strategies to enhance delivery [72]. Several liposome-based pharmaceutical formulations have since been approved, showcasing their versatility in encapsulating hydrophilic drugs within their aqueous core and hydrophobic drugs within their lipid bilayer [73]. However, liposome technologies face challenges such as complex manufacturing processes, scalability limitations, and restricted applications for small-molecule drugs. \n\nLNPs were developed to address these limitations. Similar to liposomes, LNPs are composed of phospholipids, cholesterol, and PEGylated lipids, but with the addition of ionizable cationic lipids. These cationic lipids facilitates electrostatic interactions with negatively charged nucleic acids, forming stable nanoparticles [74]. Unlike the bilayer structure of liposomes, LNPs can adopt diverse internal architectures influenced by their nucleic acid cargo, lipid composition, manufacturing methods, and processing conditions. Negatively charged biomolecules such as CRISPR-Cas9 plasmid DNA, mRNA, and gRNA can stably bind to LNPs via electrostatic interactions, enabling the formation of highly efficient delivery systems, as shown in Figure 3a. Due to these properties, LNPs have become the most widely used non-viral delivery system for nucleic acids, with extensive research into their therapeutic applications ongoing [75].",

            "text": "Nanoparticles play a pivotal role in enhancing the efficacy and stability of mRNA vaccines by protecting mRNA molecules, facilitating cellular uptake, and modulating immune responses. Several current mRNA vaccine formulations utilize nanoparticles, each employing distinct nanoparticle types and strategies to optimize vaccine delivery and performance. \n\nLipid Nanoparticle (LNP)-Based Vaccines: Lipid nanoparticles are extensively employed in mRNA vaccine development due to their ability to encapsulate mRNA, protect it from degradation, and facilitate its delivery into target cells. The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines are prominent examples utilizing LNPs to deliver mRNA encoding spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2. These LNPs consist of ionizable lipids, cholesterol, and PEGylated lipids, ensuring stability and enhancing cellular uptake through endocytosis mechanisms [26]. \n\nPolymeric Nanoparticle-Based Vaccines: Polymeric nanoparticles offer another platform for mRNA vaccine delivery, leveraging biocompatible materials like poly(lactic-coglycolic acid) (PLGA) or chitosan. These nanoparticles can encapsulate mRNA and facilitate controlled release kinetics, contributing to sustained antigen expression and immune stimulation. Research into polymeric nanoparticles for mRNA vaccines focuses on enhancing stability and fine-tuning delivery properties to optimize immune responses [10]. \n\nInorganic Nanoparticle-Based Vaccines: Inorganic nanoparticles, such as gold nanoparticles or silica nanoparticles, are explored as adjuvants or carriers in mRNA vaccines. Figure 5 illustrates the mechanisms of two types of mRNA vaccines: non-replicating mRNA vaccines and self-amplifying mRNA (SAM) vaccines. In non-replicating mRNA vaccines, in vitro transcribed (IVT) mRNA is delivered into cells via lipid nanoparticles (NPs), which are internalized through endocytosis. mRNA is then released and translated into antigenic proteins directly by ribosomes. Conversely, SAM vaccines, or replicons, contain two open reading frames (ORFs) within mRNA.",

LPN is mainly composed of three parts: one is a biodegradable polymer core encapsulating the drug, and the other is an inner lipid layer covering the polymer core [80]. The role of the molecular barrier minimizes the leakage of the encapsulated substance and slows down the degradation of the polymer by limiting the diffusion into water, thereby achieving the delayed release of the encapsulated substance; the third is the outer lipid layer of PEG, which is used to stabilize the carrier, In addition, the incorporation of lipids also increases its ability to penetrate the skin layers. Shi et al. developed lipid hybrid PLGA nanoparticles [81]. Compared with PLGA and PLGA-PEG, the A. Sufianov et al. siRNA encapsulation efficiency of hybrid nanoparticles reached 78-82%, while PLGA and PLGA-PEG only encapsulated the required 4%-8%. small RNA. Based on this, Desai et al. developed a novel hybrid lipopolymer nanocarrier (CyLiPns) with a ring-shaped cationic head: efficient delivery of TNF\u03b1-siRNA and capsaicin (Cap) to the 360 \u03bcm of the dermis demonstrates synergy in the treatment of chronic inflammatory skin diseases [82].",

            "text": "Despite these undeniable advantages, some reservations are raised by the tendency of nanoparticles to agglomerate, potential toxicity, possibility of bioaccumulation, and production costs [306]. To evaluate topical nanotechnology preparations, appropriate in vitro safety tests are used in the form of 3D EpiSkinTM \u00ae and EpiDermTM \u00ae skin models and 2D in vitro models, e.g., the human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT and the BALB/c 3T3 mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line, along with the MTT test [307]. \n\nNanoformulation systems can be constructed based on inorganic materials (metallic nanoparticles) and organic materials (lipids and polymer nanoparticles) [308]. Nanoparticle carriers should be biocompatible and biodegradable [309,310]. It has been shown that carbon nanoparticles, metallic nanoparticles, and even solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) may be potentially toxic [307] due to the small size or composition of the nanocarriers. A method to avoid skin irritation and other adverse effects on the immune system is the use of biocompatible excipients and an appropriate encapsulation strategy. Nanoencapsulation of bioactive compounds and drugs using lipid-based systems is popular in the pharmaceutical and food industries. \n\nIn 2013, Ascenso et al. [311] created vesicular nanocarrier formulations for dermal delivery of lycopene. The improvement of lycopene bioavailability through the skin was studied in vitro using a human keratinocyte cell line and in vivo with mice. The advantage of nanoformulations over conventional products in repairing UVR-damaged keratinocytes and pre-cancerous conditions was confirmed. Various formulations have been developed to increase the stability and bioavailability of \u03b2-carotene and astaxanthin in the form of nanoemulsions (NE), hydrogels/lipogels, liposomes, and NLCs.",

LPHNPs may be loaded with both water-insoluble and water-soluble drugs to provide agreed stability and regulated drug release rates. They can be improved with either natural or synthetic polymers. LPHNPs is mainly made up of some biodegradable polymeric material core encased with medication and other materials. The phospholipid layer, or lipid PEG base, covers the core even further. By encapsulating the polymeric core system, non-toxic vehicles with a unilamellar or multilamellar structure are formed on lipid structures such as liposomes and niosomes that carry hydrophilic or lipophilic drug molecules. Polymeric nanoparticles, which are made of biodegradable polymers, 33 and are utilized as colloidal and micelles nanocarriers. Liposomal carriers provide a number of advantages, including improved compatibility, a better pharmacokinetic profile, a longer retention period, and effective surface modification. \n\nAll of these characteristics, found in both liposomes and polymer carrier systems, contribute to the system's regulated and prolonged drug release as well as its stability profiles. LPHNPs have a shell-core structure that consists of a polymer core and a lipid shell. LPHNPs systems will out-perform their non-hybrid counterparts in enhancing the physicochemical characteristics of hybrid nanoparticles such as drug encapsulation, drug release control, physical stability, and cellular uptake with the necessary collection of lipids and polymers. Natural and manufactured polymers such as gelatin, sodium alginate, chitosan, and albumin are used to make polymer nanoparticles, which are biocompatible or biodegradable and non-toxic. \n\nPharmaceutical Sciences (Indexed in ISI and Scopus) https://ps.tbzmed.ac.ir \n\nThese are polymers that are found in nature.",

            "text": "In recent years, advances have been made in the design of 'hybrid' nanocarriers that incorporate both polymeric and liposomal structures [101], variously known as polymeric lipid nanoparticles (PLNs) or lipid-polymer nanoparticles, with diameters of 100 nm or lower. In these hybrid structures, the polymer regulates drug release, whereas the lipid enhances the permeation of drugs across the cell membrane. Thus, polymeric lipid hybrid nanoparticles possess the dual advantages of the biomimetic characteristics of liposomes and the strength of biodegradable polymers, and are capable of improving the biocompatibility and physical stability of drugs, and boosting their potential for use in robust drug delivery. PLNs exhibit controlled drug release and high encapsulation for therapeutics with different properties, and can be targeted. There are various designs of PLNs ranging from a core-shell structure where a polymeric core is encapsulated by a lipid bilayer, or the polymer is instead attached to the bilayer surface, to a homogenous structure where the lipid phase contains a dispersed polymer drug complex. \n\nPolymeric lipid hybrid nanoparticles hold many promising applications including cancer diagnostic imaging treatment [101]. PLNs were utilized for the codelivery of doxorubicin and mitomycin as a potential treatment of breast cancer by Zhang RX et al. [102]. The formulation was tested in a murine EMT6/WT breast cancer model. The results showed quickened and extended tumour uptake from fluorescence imaging of both agents over 24 h, and higher apoptosis and reduced organ toxicity were achieved with the PLN compared to free drugs [102]. In 2018, Monirinasab et al. synthesized PLA-PEG-PLA/cationic lipid hybrid nanoparticles for the delivery of insulin-like growth factor type I (IGF-1R) siRNA and examined their efficacy on MCF-7 cells. The results revealed high siRNA encapsulation efficiency (80%) and significantly higher cellular uptake of NPs/siRNA between 2-4 hcompared to the free siRNA and the control.",

            "text": "Nowadays, nanotechnology plays a vital role worldwide due to the benefits and potential it can provide to humans. A few decades ago, nanotechnology was implemented in industry, but this science has progressively influenced various areas of material applications, including the medical area [1]. In the biomedical field, nanotechnology offers many benefits regarding the treatment of various human diseases, taking into account precise target-oriented drug delivery to a specific organ. Generally, nanotechnology involves the study of well-defined nanostructures, by the association of nanoparticles under 100 nm with basic building blocks of different dimensions at the molecular level. Nanoparticles exhibit the great advantage of consisting in a small size and high surface area-to-volume ratio with the property of conjugation/encapsulation of different coating materials, such as organic polymers, organic surfactants, inorganic metals, inorganic compounds, or bioactive molecules [2]. Of all known structured nano-carriers, lipid nanostructures offer the possibility for developing novel therapeutics formulations, due to their unique and tailorabledependent properties. Lipids were promoted as alternative carriers, especially for lipophilic pharmaceutical products. Lipid nanoparticles known as solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) have attracted the attention of researchers because they improve the stability of pharmaceutical products and are also able to carry both lipophilic and hydrophilic drugs [3,4]. Compared to other colloidal carriers (polymeric, emulsions, liposomes), SLNs show many advantages, such as excellent biocompatibility (no toxicity because of the physiological biodegradable lipids), biodegradability, a less expensive fabrication process, sterilizability, easily industrially scaleable production, long-term stability, high entrapment efficiency, the association with the majority of molecules, and so on [5,6]. In addition to the aforementioned advantages, if they carry lipophilic drugs, the latter are automatically protected from the degradation process, because they are entrapped into the SLN lipid nanostructure [7].",

Following extensive research, LNPs have been utilized for the administration of various vaccines and have significantly enhanced both humoral and cellular immune responses. LNPs can stimulate robust follicular Th cells, durable plasma cells, B cells in germinal centers, and memory B cells, resulting in enhanced humoral immune reactions after vaccination [133]. Recently, LNPs have been extensively studied as potential carriers for mRNA vaccines in clinical trials of COVID-19, tumor vaccines, and influenza vaccines. For example, emergency marketing authorizations were granted in 2020 for Pfizer's BNT162b2 vaccine (Comirnaty) and Moderna's mRNA-1273 vaccine (Spikevax), both of which utilize LNPs for mRNA antigen delivery [134,135]. The successful use of these two mRNA vaccines has yielded exciting results and made significant contributions to the fight against COVID-19. LNPs have accelerated the utilization of mRNAs in humans, and their promising prospects in vaccine development are highly anticipated. Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) are a type of lipidbased nanocarrier comprising active pharmaceutical ingredients and solid lipids, along with surfactants and/ or co-surfactants. They serve as vaccine delivery systems that entrap drugs within natural or synthetic solid lipids, such as lecithin, acting as carriers [136]. Their internal oil phase was replaced with a solid lipid to reduce the limitations associated with conventional lipid formulations, avoid the use of organic solvents during preparation, provide better stability, reduce drug degradation, and maintain relative stability during storage. SLNs play a pivotal role in various applications in nanotechnology, such as vaccine delivery and cancer treatment, owing to their capacity to encapsulate both hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds, biocompatibility, and ease with which their surface can be modified [118].",

            "text": "LNPs, non-viral vectors prepared from multiple lipids, have been applied for the precise delivery of RNA therapeutics. Since 1989, 1,2-di-O-octadecenyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (DOTMA) and 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethyl ammonium propane (DOTAP) have become the two most widely used cation lipids. The structure of synthetic lipids is different from that of classical lipids, as the former consist of ester-connected glycerin heads and hydrocarbon tails. For example, DOTMA containing two unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon tails that are linked to a quaternary amine through ether groups exhibits the brilliant ability to deliver anionic RNA molecules 47 . This structure makes synthetic lipids more efficient at forming spherical liposomes or lipid complexes to load genetic molecules. In comparison with conventional liposomes consisting of a lipid bilayer, hybrid nanoparticles prepared from lipids and functional polymers exhibit higher stability, effectively avoiding premature leakage of the loaded cargo molecules 48 . If the longchain molecule PEG is modified on the surface of the LPNs, the nanocarriers can circulate for a longer time in vivo. Recently, siRNA-loaded DOTAP/poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) systems were employed to deliver genetic molecules to the lungs for severe lung disease treatment 49 . Generally, typical LNPs consist of four main components: cation lipids, CHO, phospholipids (auxiliary lipids), and PEG-modified lipids, which can increase the loading ability of RNA through positive and negative charges attraction, enhance nanoparticles stability, promote endosome escape, and prevent nanoparticles aggregation, respectively 50 . PEG-modified LNPs can reduce the protein opsonization effect and increase the blood circulation time in vivo owing to the PEGylated shell, leading to a stealth effect arising from the hydrophilic steric hindrance. However, the biocompatibility and long-term safety of PEG-modified nanocarriers remained unclear. Reduced transfection efficacy and cellular uptake are two disadvantages of PEG-modified LNPs.

            "text": "Nanotechnology is one of the most promising strategies developed to improve drug delivery systems. Within this field, lipid-based formulations have attracted attention for the administration of poorly soluble bioactive substances, particularly in water and aqueous solutions. The numerous advantages of these nanosystems include biodegradability, biocompatibility, and high physicochemical stability. Their capacity for drug solubilization and cell adhesion are properties that enhance the bioavailability of drugs demonstrating irregular absorption [1,2]. An important parameter of drug delivery systems relates to no or low toxicity of the carrier itself either in vivo or in the environment as a by-product. Therefore, nanoparticles fabricated using an assembly of natural biomolecules, such as lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates are expected to be appropriate. Lipid-based systems are particularly useful for clinical applications. This is closely related to the ability of lipid particles to cross cell membranes directly due to the fact that lipids are one of the basic building blocks of cell membranes [3][4][5][6][7][8]. Drug delivery using lipid-based systems can mimic biological membranes because the translocation of natural cell membrane properties to synthetic systems combines the advantages of the membrane surface and flexibility of material chemistry. An additional benefit is that such a system can escape immune system elimination [5]. Despite the membrane structure, the elasticity of nanoparticles also has an obvious impact on the ability to penetrate across the lipid bilayer as an effect of different morphological responses of hydrophilic and hydrophobic nanoparticles. Studies demonstrated that hydrophilic nanoparticles are flattened in the membrane plane, while hydrophobic nanoparticles are elongated during penetration. These results show the joint effects of elasticity and particle surface hydrophobicity on cellular uptake [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8]. Effective delivery systems allow for the protecting of drugs from fast degradation, long-term in vivo retention, immune escape, targeted controlled drug release, and give the opportunity to easily cross specific barriers in vivo [3][4][5][6].

LPNs have the potential to enhance physical stability and biocompatibility of encapsulated RNA. miR-146a loaded PGA-co-PDL-DOTAP NPs were prepared to resist COPD pathogenesis by targeting interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) expression and reducing IL-8 promoter reporter GFP via IL-1\u03b2 signaling pathway [229]. miR-146a retained biological activity in vitro with 40% reduced IRAK1 expression and reduced IL-8 promoter reporter GFP. Similar experiment was performed using PLGA and cationic lipids (DOTAP) as carriers for siRNA and spray dried into microparticles with mannitol [241]. The processing conditions were found to preserve the integrity of the siRNA. To further improve the toxicity issues of DOTAP, a new synthetic lipid-like material termed lipidoids was employed to enhance the efficacy of siRNA [242]. A systematic quality-by-design approach was used to define the optimal formulation parameters [138]. The optimized lipidoid-modified LPNs revealed more than 50-fold higher than DOTAP LPNs in vitro gene silencing at well-tolerated doses than the commercial lipofectamine. Moreover, the LPNs microparticles had an MMAD suitable for lung deposition after spray drying using mannitol as the stabilizing excipient [209]. Dispersed nanoembedded LPNs had preserved physicochemical characteristics, as well as in vitro siRNA release profile and gene silencing. Apart from dry powder, nebulization is able to delivery miR-17 LPNs for inhalation with high FPF% (89.9%) [148].",

            "text": "ith circRNA vaccine development, next-generation delivery systems are indispensable. Although currently available LNPs to deliver circRNA are promising, they have plenty of limitations, such as lower biocompatibility requiring organic solvents, complex production methods, and restrained injection routes, and are difficult to perform on large scales. More importantly, LNPs induce the activation of innate immune responses, as the ectogenic positive charges close to the cell surface are likely to be recognized as a signal of danger and contribute to triggering cascades of PRRs. 200 Given these points, in the future, the development of circRNA vaccines may be disappointing with many early vaccines that may show promise in preclinical models but fail to translate into efficacy in the clinic. Solid lipid nanoparticles and nanostructured lipid carriers exhibit the fastest growth and have been developed to address some shortcomings of LNPs. Solid lipid nanoparticles consist of lipids and stabilizing agents such as surfactants and other coating materials, which are more stable than LNPs but may expel the incorporated drugs during long-term storage. 201,202 On the basis of solid lipid nanoparticles, nanostructured lipid carriers are designed by introducing a small amount of lipid liquid. 203 Nanostructured lipid carriers have a lower degree of crystallinity of the lipid core, higher drug-loading capacity, favorable physicochemical properties, long-term colloidal stability, enhanced bioavailability of nucleic acid agents, and improved agent release ability and can be taken orally. 204,205 In addition, to maximize the therapeutic potential of circRNA vaccines, it is important to reduce off-target expression in nontarget cells and tissues. Novel delivery systems must be studied to realize the desired circRNA vaccine application.",

            "text": "Solid-lipid nanoparticles are made up of surfactants, lipids and therapeutic drugs enclosed in spherical shape colloidal nanocarriers exhibiting 50-1000 nm diameters. The lipid core and nano size range of solid-lipid nanoparticles make them versatile drug delivery carriers from nanotechnology platforms. Such nanocarriers have attained greater interest also due to their considerable biocompatibility, excellent circulation time and marked accumulation at the target site (Radhakrishnan et al., 2016;Naidoo et al., 2018). In the context of cancer treatment, paclitaxel-loaded solid-lipid nanoparticles were developed for the treatment of the human ovarian cancer cell line (OvCAR3). Results of the comparative analysis from commercial preparation showed a similar cytotoxic response after intravenous administration concluding lipid-solid nanoparticle as a suitable novel drug delivery system (Lee et al., 2007). verteporfin is a clinically registered photosensitizer drug, its solid-lipid-based nanoparticles were fabricated for ovarian cancer treatment. After laser irradiation, the developed nanosystem was efficiently internalized into the tumor environment and as a result as strong suppression of tumor cell viability was achieved. The longer circulation of verteporfin was also observed along with effective tumor uptake that was further confirmed from biodistribution and pharmacokinetic profile. Of note, adverse effects along with toxicity associated death were observed with free drug administration at a dose of 2 mg/kg; however, drug-loaded solid-lipid nanoparticles resolved that issue and after intravenous injection of nanoformulation showed no toxicity at a dose of 8 mg/kg. In addition, tumor proliferation was inhibited significantly at such dose of drug-loaded to solid-lipid nanoparticles (Michy et al., 2019). Recently, ovarian cancer was targeted via intraperitoneal therapy through paclitaxel-loaded solid-lipid nanoparticles. As compared to free drug the drug-loaded nanoformulation showed enhanced cytotoxicity.",

Lipid-based nanoparticles are able to carry large amounts of drugs, and their outer lipid layers contribute to the easy cellular uptake [62,65,66]. For chronic lung diseases, liposomes and solid lipid nanoparticles have a great benefit due to the fact that they are generally stable during aerosolization for inhalation [42]. Based on these several advantages, lipid-based nanoparticles have been studied as a potential carrier system for pulmonary drug delivery over the years.

Liposomes and solid lipid nanoparticles are slightly different in their structure, but they share several benefits as drug carriers. Lipid-based nanoparticles are able to carry large amounts of drugs, and their outer lipid layers contribute to the easy cellular uptake [62,65,66]. For chronic lung diseases, liposomes and solid lipid nanoparticles have a great benefit due to the fact that they are generally stable during aerosolization for inhalation [42]. Based on these several advantages, lipid-based nanoparticles have been studied as a potential carrier system for pulmonary drug delivery over the years. Recently, nanoparticles carrying anticancer drugs, antibiotics, antiasthma agents, and antioxidant agents have been used for the treatment of chronic lung diseases [56,[67][68][69][70].",

These lipidic system offer an encouraging avenue for advancing new therapies, primarily due to their simplicity of formulation, and distinct size-related characteristics [48]. Their capacity to encase drugs, and nucleic acids, alongside their facile surface modification, renders them appealing nanosystems for precise drug, and gene delivery. These nanocarriers can be given through different methods such as through the skin, oral, parenteral, and pulmonary, expanding their applicability. \n\nIn comparison with alternative delivery systems, lipidic nanocarriers amalgamate several benefits such as minimal toxicity, controlled release of enclosed substances, and high biocompatibility. They have demonstrated effectiveness in delivering drugs that are poorly water-soluble or insoluble, reducing unintended side effects, and enhancing the targeted delivery of active agents [49].",

            "text": "In summary, organic nanoparticles have demonstrated several benefits over traditional therapies in diagnosing and treating CVDs, showing a great deal of promise in stimulating the regeneration of damaged cardiac cells.Due to their many advantages, such as biocompatibility, drug encapsulation efficiency, targeted gene therapy, and their use in medical imaging, especially for atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, and other CVDs, organic nanoparticles may represent an improved treatment alternative.According to the findings of the recent literature, organic nanoparticles of a smaller size are recommended for drug delivery systems due to their capacity to penetrate the capillaries more readily.\n\nThis paper discussed organic nanoparticles, mainly dividing them into lipid-and polymeric-based materials according to their chemical composition.Polymeric NPs hold great promise as a delivery system to overcome the shortcomings of existing methods for diagnosing and treating various CVDs.To treat stent-related complications non-invasively, stents coated with polymeric material containing dispersed or encapsulated drugs have been developed.Moreover, lipid-based nanoparticles can be used with polymer-coated stents or as stand-alone drug delivery systems, with particular advances being noted in developing liposome-and micelle-based therapeutics.In addition, chemical species have been able to reside at the focal core of a dendrimer due to the unique nanoscale architecture produced by extensive branching, which also allows for various interactions between other dendrimers and the surrounding molecular environment.\n\nRegarding the usage of organic nanoparticles, there are still several challenges to overcome, such as the stability of nanoparticles in the human body and the control of their size and shape.Moreover, toxicity studies on nanomedicine, a novel form of therapy, have frequently been disregarded in recent decades.There is currently no standard to assess and classify the hazardous levels of different organic nanoparticles, despite growing interest in their safety.Standardizing a comprehensive toxicology protocol is therefore necessary.Particular consideration must be given to the biological fate of the materials and their cellular toxicity when applying them to the heart, particularly when cardioprotection aims to preserve cells.",

            "text": "Over the past decades, the formation of lipid nanoparticles from oligonucleotides and cationic lipids has been the most used and advanced nucleic acid delivery technology (Mendon\u00e7a et al., 2021;Khare et al., 2023). In 2021, the effectiveness and safety of lipid nanoparticles were validated in two mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, leading to their widespread development for delivering nucleic acid drugs for the treatment of diseases such as cancer and atherosclerosis. Lipid nanoparticles, composed of one or more phospholipid bilayers, can incorporate lipophilic drugs within the lipid layers and dissolve hydrophilic drugs in their aqueous core, thus protecting fragile drug molecules from degradation (Shaw and Paul, 2022). Clinically validated lipid nanoparticle formulations include four main components: ionizable lipids, cholesterol, phospholipids, and PEGylated lipids. Lipid nanoparticle-mediated delivery of siRNAs offers unique advantages, including good biocompatibility due to their lipid composition, and customizable composition and preparation Review parameters for desired size, charge, and surface functionality. Only a small amount of internalized siRNA contributes to gene silencing, as most internalized siRNA is released back into the extracellular space via endocytotic recycling (Yonezawa et al., 2020). Inside the cell, lipid nanoparticles are internalized through endocytosis, facilitating endosomal escape. Lipid nanoparticle technology has achieved clinical success in delivering RNAi therapeutic drugs, with Onpattro being the first FDA-approved RNAi-based therapeutic for the treatment of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis in adults (Kulkarni et al., 2019a;Gao et al., 2022b). Onpattro delivers siRNAs enclosed in lipid nanoparticles intravenously directly to the liver cells, acting by transiently silencing transthyretin protein expression (Pattipeiluhu et al., 2022).",

            "text": "Lipid-based nanoparticles have been widely investigated for drug delivery systems. These NPs are amphiphilic, being able to transfer both hydrophilic and hydrophobic materials in one particle [85]. Lipid-based carriers are made from biocompatible, biodegradable lipids similar to those consisting of the cell membrane. These features allow them to penetrate the cells efficiently and limit their toxicity. Most commonly used lipid-based NP formulations are (Figure 3) liposomes, nanoemulsions formed with micelles, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN), and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) [86,87]. These lipid-based NPs are often modified with polymers such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) or poloxamers. PEG is a hydrophilic polymer that is biocompatible and stabilizes NPs [88]. Furthermore, it acts as a mucus penetration enhancer by decreasing interaction with mucin [76]. Poloxamers, similar to PEG, are water-soluble, non-ionic surfactants and consist of a triblock copolymer of hydrophobic polypropylene glycol and two hydrophilic blocks of PEG. They have low toxicity, good drug release, and are compatible with many different chemicals, making them useful tools for drug delivery [89]. Poloxamer 407 (Pluronic F127) and 188 (Pluronic F-68) both have high contents of PEG (70% and 80%, respectively) and can help decrease mucus viscosity and increase penetration by interacting with lipid membranes and tight junctions [90,91]. \n\nand hydrophilicity of original nanocarriers through nanoparticle-biomolecule interactions [78]. Also, the pharmacokinetic profile, such as cellular uptake, half-life, and distribution can be modified [79,80]. The biocorona can be recognized by complement receptors on macrophages and undergo increased cellular uptake and accumulated in the liver and spleen [81]. Some studies showed that metal-based nanoparticles may cause negative effects on the cardiovascular system and the nervous system.",

            "text": "The tumor cells exploit multiple mechanisms to prevent the accumulation of the drugs into the cells resulting in drug resistance. This drug resistance is a key factor that limits the success of chemotherapy in the clinical setup. In the present study, combination chemo-photodynamic therapy using lipid encapsulated polymeric nanoparticles were employed against the ovarian carcinoma cells. A major advantage of these coated particles is the combination of two different therapeutic modalities in one carrier thereby limiting any type of toxicity associated with the use of different nanocarriers. mTHPC liposomes were formulated using the thin-film hydration method. These liposomes showed an effective drug loading as well as a higher photocytotoxicity as compared to free mTHPC. Two different sizes of THP nanoparticles (ie, 200 nm and 400 nm) were prepared using the solvent evaporation technique and their physicochemical parameters as well their cell viability studies were conducted. It was observed that THP NP 200 nm produced higher cytotoxicity as compared to THP NP 400 nm which can be attributed to the fact that the smaller nanoparticles are readily taken up by the cells as compared to larger nanoparticles (ie, 400 nm). Based on these parameters, mTHPC loaded liposomes were coated over the THP NP. The formed LCNPs exhibited better physicochemical properties as compared to free mTHPC and free THP such as improved biocompatibility profile, serum stability, as well as higher ROS production. The morphological characterizations using AFM and TEM revealed the complete coating of the nanoparticle's surface with the lipid bilayer. The LCNPs when irradiated with different light fluences, also manifested a synergistic effect leading to a surpassed cytotoxicity profile. The comet assay did not show any sign of genotoxicity. The acute in vivo toxicity assessment of the optimized formulations containing 5 mg.kg \u22121 of THP and 0.15 mg.kg \u22121 of mTHPC, following intravenous administration, did not show any significant effect on the parameters, ie, serum biochemical analysis.",

            "text": "Nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems show promise in cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. These systems encapsulate or conjugate drugs with different solubility profiles into biocompatible and biodegradable nanocarriers. Overcoming biological barriers and achieving targeted drug delivery are significant challenges in cancer therapy. Nanocarriers can target tumors through both passive targeting, using the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effects, as well as active targeting using site-specific ligands [29]. \n\nLipid-based nanocarriers are widely used to improve the bioavailability, targeting efficiency, and delivery of therapeutic molecules. They offer advantages such as low toxicity, scalability, strong biocompatibility, and high drug-loading efficiency [154]. Due to their favorable surface-to-mass ratio, lipid-based nanocarriers exhibit enhanced uptake in the testis through mechanisms involving solubilization in the intestinal environment, intestinal lymphatic transport, and enterocyte-mediated transport [155]. Lipid-based nanostructures, including emulsions, liposomes, niosomes, solid-lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs), are commonly used in drug delivery. Liposomes and niosomes are vesicles with aqueous cores while emulsions consist of lipid droplets stabilized by surfactants. SLNs have dense lipid cores and NLCs contain liquid lipid droplets within tightly-packed cores. Liposomes are versatile in encapsulating both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs, with hydrophilic molecules being loaded into the inner cavity and hydrophobic drugs being incorporated into the lipid bilayer [154]. \n\nPolymer-based nanostructures are frequently employed to manipulate biodistribution and enhance the natural antioxidant properties of nanocarriers. The biodistribution of nano-encapsulated bioactive compounds primarily depends on the sizes, shapes, chemical compositions, and surface properties of the encapsulated nanoparticles, making them less reliant on the physicochemical properties of the encapsulated active pharmaceutical ingredients [156].",

            "text": "Lipid-based nanoparticles (LNPs), especially liposomes, are promising platforms for cancer therapy, due to their good biodegradability, biocompatibility, structural simplicity, and tailorable functionality (Tang W. L. et al., 2018). LNPs can be basically divided into the following seven categories: liposome, core-shell NP, micelle, solid lipid nanoparticle (SLN), nanodisc and cubosome. The surface of liposomes can be modified by incorporating various functional motifs. LNPs are widely used not only because of their varieties, but also because they can be loaded with a variety of hydrophobic and hydrophilic therapeutic agents including chemotherapeutics, peptides, proteins, DNA, and RNA as shown in Figure 3 (Yang and Merlin, 2020). In this section, we focused on the current advances and applications of solid lipid NPs and liposomes. \n\nSolid lipid NPs comprise lipids with low melting point, and varieties of surfactants and/or co-surfactants (Tapeinos et al., 2017). Selection and ratio of lipid and surfactant types determine the size, potential, stability, and drug loading and release profile of lipid NPs. \n\nSolid lipid NPs are used to improve delivery of drugs with poor water solubility. For example, quercetin, an antioxidant found in onions, shows potent anti-tumor activities against CRC; however, it has poor water solubility. Li et al. (2009) designed quercetin-loaded solid lipid nanoparticles (QT-SLNs) using emulsification and low-temperature solidification method. The QT-SLNs showed longer Tmax and mean residence time (MRT), and improved relative bioavailability, implying that SLNs are effective oral delivery carriers for these hydrophobic agents. \n\nSimilarly, Shen et al. (2019) developed doxorubicin and superparamagnetic iron oxide NPs-loaded SLN delivery system and decorated the surface of SLNs with folate (FA) and dextran. Modification of these SLNs improved targeting capacity to cancer cells and facilitated its cellular uptake.",

            "text": "In addition to the lipid-and viral vector-based carriers, a wide range of inorganic and polymer-based nanomaterials have garnered substantial attention as delivery systems for RNA-based therapeutics [57]. These nanoparticles offer distinctive advantages in safeguarding the RNA cargo, effectively shielding it from degradation by RNase enzymes through mechanisms such as steric hindrance and electrostatic repulsion [58]. Through precise control over their physicochemical properties, surface area, and modifications (e.g., incorporation of quaternary ammonium groups or cationic lipid membrane coatings), these nanoparticle-based delivery systems can be tailored and optimized for the effective delivery of RNA-based drug payloads. Cationic polymers, such as polyethyleneimine (PEI), chitosan, and polypeptides, can electrostatically complex with negatively charged RNA molecules to form nanoparticles [59,60]. These polymer-based nanoparticles can protect RNA from degradation, facilitate cellular uptake, and promote endosomal escape. Biodegradable and biocompatible polymers, such as poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) (PCL), have also been used to develop RNA delivery vehicles [61]. \n\nAmong the diverse array of inorganic nanoparticle platforms, mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs or MSNPs) have emerged as one of the most promising delivery systems for RNA-based therapeutics. However, given the relatively short research history of MSNs and their safety concerns, this technology is still in the experimental phase and has yet to reach practical clinical applications. In contrast to LNP systems, MSNs provide greater flexibility for personalization and optimization by allowing for the adjustment of key parameters such as mesoporous pore size and surface functional group modifications (Figure 2C). The interfacial design of MSNs can be ingenious and multifaceted. On one hand, the pores within the MSN structure serve as the cage, enabling them to effectively encapsulate and transport RNA-based drugs. RNA can be unstable in the complex physiological fluid.",

            "text": "Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease which is the main cause for cardiovascular diseases which account for millions of deaths each year [1]. There are several clinical therapies that exist to control the plaque formation by managing the risk factors or invasive surgical procedures. As there are so many types of drugs used for the treatment of atherosclerosis, there is also an increasing interest in nanoparticles for the targeted delivery of drugs to the atherosclerotic plaque. This review discussed the efficiency and efficacy of current drugs used to treat atherosclerosis employing nanomaterials for their delivery. The nanomaterial used depends on the type of the drug used and its solubility. We have reviewed the most popular drug types: (i) statins, (ii) nucleic acid therapies, (iii) anti-inflammatory/chemotherapeutic agents, (iv) other small molecule drugs and (v) peptides. The ideal nanomaterial used for these particular drug types is inferred despite the limitations present in the literature.\n\nSeveral nanomaterials were discussed with the most common type of nanomaterial being lipid nanoparticles followed by metal and polymeric nanoparticles (Fig. 1). Each nanomaterial possesses distinct characteristics. As it is challenging to compare treatment efficacy of different delivery systems for a specific type of drugs due to limited information presented in the literature and differences in experiment settings and nanoparticle doses used, the selection of an optimal nanomaterial is contingent upon payload. Lipid nanoparticles are ideal carriers due to their synthesis from biocompatible and biodegradable building blocks. They can encapsulate both hydrophobic (within the lipid bilayer) and hydrophilic drugs (in the aqueous core). Despite this, balancing the drug loading capacity and maintaining an optimal particle size presents a significant challenge with these particles. Other disadvantages of these NPs include lack of targeting ability and short blood circulation which can be addressed by modifying the NP. Polymeric NPs can incorporate both hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs as well with the polymers having tuneable chemical and physical properties that can release the payload in a sustained manner or in a stimuli responsive manner. Like lipid NPs, these particles can load",

            "text": "These systems have several advantages, such as: making it possible to avoid drug degradation, consequently increasing its concentration at the action site; having a reduced particle size, which results in higher surface area, allowing to overcome biological and physiological barriers; allowing drug targeting according to the nanoparticle's surface functionalization, directing it to the site of action. In intranasal administration, a particle size between 10 and 300 nm is advantageous since nanoparticles that are this size can be transported directly by the olfactory nerve to the brain. There are two major groups of nanoparticles: polymeric and lipid [33,46,48]. \n\nPolymeric nanoparticles can be divided into two groups, depending on the preparation method that is used and on the characteristics of the resulting system: nanocapsules, in which there is a reservoir system, which means the drug is confined to a cavity surrounded by a single polymer membrane that is present on the surface of the nanoparticle, coating it; or nanospheres, which are homogeneous matrix systems, in which the drug is uniformly dispersed or dissolved in. By modulating the polymer, it is possible to control the release of the drug to reach the desired therapeutic concentrations at the action site for the required period of time [33,48]. \n\nLipid nanoparticles are subdivided into solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs). SLNs are constituted by a solid lipid matrix, that is, by lipids that remain solid at room temperature and body temperature. The lipophilic drug is dissolved or dispersed in this matrix, which is surrounded by a surfactant layer in an aqueous dispersion that contributes to the stability of the nanoparticle. When compared to polymeric nanoparticles, lipid nanoparticles are considered more biocompatible and biodegradable, have low toxicity, are easy to produce on a large scale, have better physical stability, and good control of drug release. SLNs, however, have some disadvantages, namely the structural reorganization they undergo over time (such as recrystallization), because they only have one type of lipid, which creates a tighter internal structure with less space to incorporate drug molecules.",

            "text": "The role of lipids in drug delivery has evolved significantly, with lipid-based nanocarriers like liposomes and lipid nanoparticles becoming integral tools in the pharmaceutical industry [200]. These carriers are specifically designed to encapsulate hydrophobic drugs, offering solutions to the persistent challenge of enhancing the solubility and stability of advanced therapeutic agents. \n\nLiposomes, which consist of a lipid bilayer surrounding an aqueous core, have gained prominence as versatile drug-delivery vehicles [201]. The lipid bilayer mimics the structure of biological membranes, making liposomes inherently biocompatible. This biocompatibility reduces the likelihood of adverse reactions, making liposomes a safe choice for drug encapsulation. Moreover, the lipid composition can be tailored to achieve the desired drug-release profile, further highlighting their versatility. By incorporating hydrophobic drugs into the lipid bilayer, liposomes can increase the solubility of these compounds in aqueous environments. This is a crucial advantage, as many drugs with potent therapeutic properties are inherently hydrophobic, posing challenges for their formulation and administration. Liposomes not only enhance drug solubility but also protect the drug from degradation, extending its shelf life and ensuring that the therapeutic payload remains intact until it reaches its intended target within the body. \n\nLipid nanoparticles represent another powerful lipid-based nanocarrier option. They are typically composed of lipids and are smaller in size compared to liposomes, enhancing drug-loading capacity in some specific circumstances, for example when dealing with highly potent yet hydrophobic drugs [202]. Notably stable, lipid nanoparticles are suitable for prolonged storage and distribution. A key advantage lies in their ability to enable controlled drug release for hydrophobic drugs, achieved by manipulating lipid composition to fine-tune release kinetics. This feature is crucial for maintaining specific drug concentrations in the bloodstream for successful treatment. The modification of lipid surface properties further allows for targeted drug delivery, enhancing precision and efficiency while minimizing off-target effects through functionalization with ligands or antibodies. The transformative impact of lipid-based nanocarriers spans various medical fields.",

            "text": "Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) are nanocarriers that contain biocompatible and physiologically active lipids. They are widely considered drug delivery systems due to their capability to encapsulate both lipophilic and hydrophilic drugs (11,12), biodegradability, bioavailability, stability (4), sustained release of drugs, non-toxicity (11), flexible surface functionality (13), prolonged circulation in the body (14), and suitability for large-scale production (15). \n\nAccording to the previous reports, SLNs do not display the restrictions associated with polymeric nanoparticles and liposomes, including sterilization, toxicity, and long-term stability. Moreover, these carriers show advantages over other drug delivery systems, such as high encapsulation efficiency, improved physical stability, sustained drug release, easy large-scale production, and increased bioavailability (16)(17)(18). It was established that the docetaxel-loaded SLNs showed lower IC 50 and higher effectiveness than free docetaxel. Moreover, docetaxel-loaded SLNs induced more apoptosis pathways than free docetaxel in cancer cells (19). In vitro cytotoxicity and in vivo antitumor studies indicated that SLNs could be a promising principle for doxorubicin delivery and provide a new perspective for breast cancer treatment (20). It has been reported that 1,3-diacylglycerol (DAG) SLNs can be used as a promising nanocarrier for loading thymol with high encapsulation and stability (4).",

This system consists of the entrapped drug in biocompatible lipid core and surfactant at the outer surface (10). To reduce the shortcomings associated with SLNs, a new model of LNPs, namely NLCs, was developed consisting of a lipid matrix with a particular nanostructure (11). This nanostructure increased drug encapsulation efficiency and drug stability during storage. While SLNs consist of solid lipids, NLCs include some liquid lipids, which make imperfections in the lipid matrix (12). Recently, nanocapsules such as LNCs were developed, that is a vesicular system in which a drug is restricted to a cavity bounded by a polymer film (13). LNCs are considered as a hybrid delivery system with a core containing medium-chain triglycerides enveloped by a polymeric membrane (14). This structure provides some more advantages such as higher drug encapsulation capacity, higher protection from drug degradation, and lower burst release (15). \n\nTo improve pharmacological properties of TLM, this study as a preliminary project was aimed to formulate three novel TLM-loaded lipid nanoparticles (SLN, NLC and LNC) and to characterize their physicochemical properties, in-vitro drug release behavior, and antibacterial activities.",

Hybrid nanoparticles include lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles, protein-dendrimer hybrid nanoparticles and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) mimetics (Qin et al., 2019). Lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles are core-shell nanoparticle structures made of polymer cores and lipid/lipid-PEG shells that show complementary properties in their biocompatibility and physical stability from both polymeric nanoparticles and liposomes (Hadinoto et al., 2013). Lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles exhibit higher in vivo cellular delivery when compared to either polymeric nanoparticles or liposomes. The formulation of lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles with chitosan has been shown to significantly increase mucosal immune responses against some STIs (Hadinoto et al., 2013;Rose et al., 2018).\n\nIn recent years newly engineered nanoparticles known as nanolipoproteins (NLPs), which are HDL mimetics consisting of discoidal lipid bilayer stabilized by apolipoproteins have been in development with desirable attributes for vaccine delivery. NLPs also known as nanodiscs are effective antigen carriers and supporting adjuvants that improve vaccine performance against infectious diseases. We have previously demonstrated that the use of NLPs enhances immune responses to both antigen and adjuvants in vivo Weilhammer et al., 2013;Weilhammer et al., 2017;Weilhammer et al., 2020). We have demonstrated that NLPs provide a membrane-like environment, which facilitate the embedding of functional membrane-bound proteins in their native conformations (He et al., 2017;Tifrea et al., 2021). The versatility of this type of nanoparticle underscores its potential for vaccines targeting bacterial and viral STIs.",

Solid lipid nanoparticles are prepared by using either natural or synthetic lipids e.g., triglycerides, carnauba wax, cetyl alcohol, emulsifying wax, beeswax, cholesterol, and cholesterol butyrate (165)(166)(167)(168). Solid lipid nanoparticles were reported for delivery of doxorubicin, paclitaxel, idarubicin, etoposide and camptothecins as anticancer agents (169). \n\nSolid lipid nanoparticles have ability to encapsulate both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs and offer greater stability, longer circulation, and biocompatibility. Solid lipid nanoparticles were reported for their application in diagnosis of lung diseases and also for drug delivery to lungs (170,171). For the last 3 decades, solid lipid nanoparticles have been explored by researchers to solve several drug delivery obstacles and hence found as potential drug carriers for anticancer agents too. They can provide improved bioavailability and sustained drug delivery of anticancer drugs. The suitability of solid lipid nanoparticles for lung cancer therapy is because of their safety profile attributed to their biocompatible lipids used in the fabrication (172). They offer high biocompatibility, low toxicity, improved drug targeting and ease of fabrication at low cost (173,174). \n\nLigand-based surface alteration of solid lipid nanoparticles could enhance the target efficiency and allow them as suitable carrier systems for targeted drug delivery (175). \n\nReinstating the p53 gene because of its significant role in the effective induction of apoptosis has been successfully reported as a better therapy in cancer. Cationic solid lipid nanoparticles are used to transfect lung cancer cells with the p53 gene (116,151).",

Biodegradable polymeric nano-based targeted drug delivery technologies have demonstrated remarkable advantages in achieving precise local delivery while minimizing unintended off-target side effects [8]. Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) show promise in drug delivery due to enhanced stability and controlled release. Yet, achieving precise organ and site-specific delivery is a complex task.

            "text": "Nanosized particles were explored for the entrapment of drugs as a novel strategy to increase their targetability, bioavailability, and therapeutic effect, as well as the range of molecules to be clinically used [52]. Since their introduction as drug delivery systems, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) were explored for use in the most diverse administration routes (Figure 4). Among them, these lipid systems represent an interesting approach for the ocular route, due to their ability to improve the corneal penetration of drugs [48,[52][53][54][55][56]. SLNs and NLCs are delivery systems that combine the advantages of liposomes and emulsions (biocompatibility and possibility to scale-up) with the advantages of polymeric nanoparticles (protection of the drug and modulation of the release profile) [57]. These versatile lipid carriers exhibit improved drug loading and permeation characteristics, followed by acceptable safety profile [58][59][60][61], which are reasons that allow their use for ocular delivery. Moreover, the possibility to be produced under sterilized conditions and/or being sterilized by autoclaving [62] further enhances their interest for ocular administration of drug [63]. The mucoadhesive properties of lipid nanoparticles are an additional advantage to improve their intimate contact with the ocular mucosa. The prolonging of the corneal contact time of the loaded drug can further be enhanced by developing cationic nanoparticles [64][65][66][67], increasing the bioavailability and reducing undesirable effects [68][69][70][71][72].",

            "text": "Nanotechnology is defined as the control or restructuring of matter at the atomic and molecular levels, within the range of nano to submicron dimensions (typically 1-100 nm). It involves the manufacturing of nanomaterials, their applications, and integration into physical, chemical, and biological systems (Bhushan, 2017). Advances in nanotechnology for biomedical applications created a variety of nanoparticle-based diagnostic and therapeutic approaches with valuable properties for CNS drug delivery. Delivering therapeutic compounds using nanoparticles improves biodistribution and pharmacokinetics, allows co-delivery of multiple compounds, enables targeted intracellular drug delivery, and reduces systemic toxicity and side effects (Wong et al., 2012). Diverse types of nanocarriers are being explored for drug delivery, including nanoparticles derived from organic (e.g., polyethylene glycol, PEG; poly(lactideco-glycolide), PLGA), inorganic (e.g., manganese, gold), biological (e.g., lipoproteins, albumin) and hybrid elements (Moeinzadeh and Jabbari, 2017). Among the most widely investigated nanoparticles in drug delivery are liposomes, micelles, dendrimers, and polymeric nanoparticles. \n\nLiposomes are self-assembled lipid bilayer vesicles that can incorporate hydrophilic drugs in the inner aqueous phase, and lipophilic drugs within the phospholipid bilayer. Liposomes are easy to formulate, biocompatible and biodegradable nanoparticles that can be administered via different routes (oral, topical, parenteral) (Torchilin, 2005). Micelles, on the other hand, are hydrophilic shells of amphiphilic block copolymers that typically have smaller diameters (10-100 nm) and allow for controlled release of lipophilic drugs. Both liposomes and micelles are currently used in clinical practice for management of cancer, infections, neurological disease, and other applications (Patra et al., 2018).",

            "text": "There has been a constant effort to develop nanoparticle-based RNA delivery using reported vehicles. A detailed pharmacokinetic and clearance clinical data have been reported regarding patisiran [196,197]. The approved animal models, toxicity readouts, and time points for patisiran were detailed in a report from the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research [198]. These data provide a thorough roadmap for characterising nanoparticle-based RNA delivery of appropriate clinical outcome. In a broader sense, the 3 RNA drug delivery systems that have received FDA approval [108,199] or an EUA grant [200] thus far seem to have six qualities (Figure 6) that, when taken together, might be considered hallmarks of authorised delivery vehicles. To begin with, biodegradable, scalable chemistry is typically used in the fabrication of therapeutic delivery systems. The LNP safety of Moderna, Acuitas, and Alnylam lipids, all of which are used in humans, was enhanced by introducing ester linkages, which may breakdown in water, to form ionizable lipids [201]. The RNA-based delivery technique must be chemically simple to enable human-scale production; for instance, let us consider a clinical trial setting where injecting a vaccine into a patient weighing 100 kg was administered with 6 mg/kg lipid and 0.3 mg/kg RNA (that is, a lipid:RNA mass ratio of 20:1), roughly 1 g of lipid would be needed for a single vaccine unit, assuming that there is no loss of lipid during formulation development. GalNAc conjugates, attached to siRNAs or ASOs independently, can be manufactured on a human scale (with the capacity to manufacture a large batch that complies with cGMP or Current Good Manufacturing Practice). Only LNPs with four lipid components and no targeting ligands were approved by regulators. It is essential that those developing therapeutic nanoparticles should know the benefits and drawbacks of incorporating targeted ligands [202]. Third, there needs to be a good on-target to off-target delivery ratio using the RNA delivery system. Biodistribution and function are two metrics that may be used to assess on-and off-target delivery.",

            "text": "Lipid-based NPs form colloidal dispersions. These drug delivery systems can be emulsions, vesicular systems and lipid particulate systems [57]. Liposomes are vesicles having one or more phospholipid bilayers. Phospholipids consist of a hydrophilic head and a hydrophobic tail: the apolar chains face each other, whereas the polar heads are oriented towards the aqueous medium and in the central compartment forming the liposome. The hydrophilic drugs occupy the aqueous compartment; meanwhile, the lipophilic ones are attached to the liposomal lipid membrane bilayer by the hydrophobic interaction [57]. Liposomes range in size between 20 nm and 10 \u00b5m [58]. Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) were identified as a viable alternative to various colloidal systems. SLNs have a spherical shape with a dimension ranging from 50 nm to 1000 nm, and they are composed of a solid lipid core stabilized in the aqueous medium by surfactants [57]. They present high biocompatibility because lipids are well tolerated by the body and have reduced cellular and systemic toxicity. SLNs improve drug stability due to the drug's protection from chemical and enzymatic degradation, and enhance its bioavailability [59]. Due to the high lipid biocompatibility, they can be administered through all existing routes of administration. Since they consist of hardcore solid lipids at room temperature, SLNs can guarantee stability and controlled drug release and improve the drug delivery to its target. \n\nNanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) differ from SLNs because their core is made up of both solid and liquid lipids. NLCs show higher drug loading capacity than SLNs because their nucleus is less organized [57,60]. \n\nLipid drug delivery nanosystems are good candidates to encapsulate poorly watersoluble, lipophilic drugs and poorly permeable drugs [60]; particular attention should be paid to the choice and concentration of lipids because, as mentioned above, they can reduce the clearance and increase the plasma half-life of the formulation [13,60].",

            "text": "The possibility of PLGA surface modification by the addition of PEG or specific targeting ligands is also valuable in terms of enhancing therapeutic potential by prolonging blood circulation and active targeting [20]. Different PLGA nanoparticle preparation methods provide many strategies to encapsulate various anticancer drugs, including paclitaxel, doxorubicin, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil [21]. With continuing approval of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for PLGA-based nanomedicines, these nanocarriers can be promising alternatives to liposomal drug delivery systems in situations where the encapsulation of certain compounds in liposomes is either inefficient or impossible. \n\nThe future of PLGA nanoparticle technology will be the development of hybrid lipid nanoparticles as a novel platform for drug delivery. Bare PLGA nanoparticles are characterized by suitable biocompatibility and biodegradability for pharmaceutical usage, high structural integrity, and stability, with a narrow polydispersity of the particles [22]. However, bare nanoparticles with no proper surface modification will be rapidly cleared from blood vessels by the immune system [23]. The addition of lipids to the PLGA structure results in the production of hybrid lipid/PLGA nanoparticles with a distinct lipid shell and polymeric core. This system creates a bridge between liposomal and polymeric worlds, with benefits coming from both of these worlds. The polymeric core provides excellent structural integrity and stability during storage, biocompatibility, and biodegradability, and the lipid shell provides low immunogenicity using certain lipids, the amphiphilic character of the carrier, and minimal drug leakages during preparation and storage [22]. Using certain preparation methods, there is a possibility of using different lipids to create nanoparticles with the desired lipid shell to obtain certain physiochemical properties of the carrier, such as changing the surface zeta potential from highly negative (for bare PLGA nanoparticles) to highly positive for particles with shells composed of positively charged lipids. \n\nMany medicinal-plant-derived compounds have been tested against pancreatic cell lines.",

            "text": "Briefly, there are different types of nanoparticulate drug delivery systems (nanocarrier) which include polymeric nanoparticles (e.g., nanosphere, nanocapsules, dendrimers, polymeric micelles), lipid nanoparticles (e.g., solid lipid nanoparticles, liposomes, fatty acid micelles), lipopolymeric nanoparticles (e.g., PEGylated phospholipid micelles, PEGylated liposomes), carbon nanotubes, and nanocrystals [16,55,56]. For pulmonary delivery, polymeric nanoparticles are made up of biodegradable or biocompatible polymer materials [3]. Polymeric micelles are made of amphiphilic molecules that form a core and shell structure with a hydrophobic core and a hydrophilic surface. A PEGylated liposome is made of a concentric phospholipid bilayer (i.e., lamellar) with a hydrophilic core (Figure 2) and is typically a mixture of phospholipid (major component) and PEGylated phospholipid (minor component) [16]. With only PEGylated phospholipid present, a PEGylated micelle exists (Figure 2). Inorganic nanoparticles are beyond the scope of this article, and hence, will not be presented. For further details on different types of nanoparticles, the reader is referred to textbooks on the topic [57]. \n\nThe nanoparticle carriers can be formulated into solution or suspension and delivered by a nebulizer or pressured metered dose inhaler (pMDI), while solid state nanoparticles as powders are delivered via a dry powder inhaler (DPI) [32]. Nanoparticle size of 40-200 nm has exhibited cellular uptake in vitro. Nanoparticles can envelope the drug from degradation, increase solubility, as well as be used for sustained release delivery and targeted drug delivery [58].",

In order to overcome this issue, a huge range of therapeutics such as drugs (functionalized with specific targeting segments), DNA/ RNA, genes, enzymes, antioxidants can be precisely loaded into the matrix of polymeric/lipid nanomedicines. In some studies on brain cancer, the majority of synthetic nanomedicines used are polymers such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) or Poly(lactide-co-glycolide) with different surface/physicochemical properties, size and shape. 55,56 owever, their degradation produces acidic by-products which are toxic for brain tissue, making them unsuitable for extended drug delivery application, hence, inorganic nanoparticles (still toxic) and lipid-based structures have been introduced. \n\nWith regard to brain cancers, drug delivery happens at local or systemic level; the former will permeate the BBB, accumulating a higher concentration of drug with minimum adverse effects for adjacent intact tissues, evading also degradation/hydrolysis and clearance processes before its in-site delivery. Implants, intraventricular/intrathecal and convection enhanced delivery (CED) all can be named as examples of local drug delivery. The latter, systemic drug delivery on the other hand, is the most common one in terms of compliance for patients since it doesn't require surgical or clinical intervention, with possibility of repeated doses which makes them less invasive and more favorable compared to the local drug delivery. \n\nSo far, numerous nanomedicines with various size, surface charge and hydration and targeting character have been exploited for brain anticancer delivery, among them nanoparticles, nanofibers and hydrogels (Polymer-based nanostructures), lipid nanocapsules, liposomes, SLNs and NLCs (lipid-based nanostructures) have been widely studied. \n\nSLNs and NLCs belong to lipid-based nanosystems of drug delivery. They offer better advantages over the polymeric or inorganic nanoparticles; biocompatibility, better penetration through the BBB without any structural modification influencing their function and easy largescale production.",

This technology offers several advantages, such as the protection of active agents, controlled and sustained release, increase in therapeutic effect, and reduction of side effects [9]. In this regard, several antifungal agents have been encapsulated in nanoparticles (NPs) with positive results in animal models and clinical therapy [10,11]. \n\nThe attention of the formulation scientists has recently turned to biocompatible lipids as carriers for the delivery of poorly soluble drugs [12], among which lipid nanoparticle-based on solid matrix has gained considerable interest. In general, there exist two types of lipid nanoparticles with solid matrix, namely solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) [13]. The SLNs are prepared using solid lipids (i.e., lipids that are solid at room temperature, as well as at body temperature). Theses lipids are biocompatible and biodegradable with generally recognized as safe (GRAS) status. SLNs are proved highly beneficial in a number of ways, such as the use of organic solvents, bioavailability of highly lipophilic, sustained drug release from the nanoparticle matrix, and penetration through skin or mucus barrier due to nano-size. Nonetheless, the amount of encapsulated drug and drug release profile of SLNs may change with storage time. NLCs have been developed as an alternative drug carrier systems as the result of further improvement and reduction of these drawbacks of SLNs. NLC matrix consists of spatially different lipid molecules mixture and normal mixture of solid and liquid lipid which makes more imperfection in the matrix to accommodate more drug molecules, as compared to SLN. Although several research reports have already been published on SLNs and NLCs, the advantages of NLCs over SLNs have not been fully established yet and the studies performed so far have given several contradictory results in this regard [14][15][16].",

            "text": "Therapeutic HPV vaccines that induce potent HPV-specific cellular immunity and eliminate pre-existing infections remain elusive. Among various candidates under development, those based on DNA constructs are considered promising because of their safety profile, stability, and efficacy. However, the use of electroporation (EP) as a main delivery method for such vaccines is notorious for adverse effects like pain and potentially irreversible muscle damage. Moreover, the requirement for specialized equipment adds to the complexity and cost of clinical applications. As an alternative to EP, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) that are already commercially available for delivering mRNA and siRNA vaccines are likely to be feasible. Here, we have compared three intramuscular delivery systems in a preclinical setting. In terms of HPV-specific cellular immune responses, mice receiving therapeutic HPV DNA vaccines encapsulated with LNP demonstrated superior outcomes when compared to EP administration, while the naked plasmid vaccine showed negligible responses, as expected. In addition, SM-102 LNP M exhibited the most promising results in delivering candidate DNA vaccines. Thus, LNP proves to be a feasible delivery method in vivo, offering improved immunogenicity over traditional approaches.",

This review also explores the integration of advanced technologies, such as theranostics and artificial intelligence, to optimize NP design and functionality for personalized medicine.

Addressing these barriers requires interdisciplinary research focused on developing stimuli-responsive NPs, improving biocompatibility, and incorporating multimodal therapeutic platforms. Although substantial progress has been made, this review is limited by the paucity of clinical trials validating NP efficacy and safety in diverse patient populations. Future endeavors should prioritize translational research to bridge the gap between preclinical innovations and clinical applications, ensuring that these transformative technologies benefit a broader spectrum of cancer patients.

Levofloxacin (LFX), a widely used broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotic, is limited by poor aqueous solubility, low oral bioavailability, and systemic side effects. This study investigates the formulation, characterization, and evaluation of levofloxacin-loaded nanoparticles aimed at improving its pharmacological performance. Various nanoparticle carriers, including polymeric nanoparticles, lipid-based nanocarriers, and inorganic nanoparticles, were explored for their ability to encapsulate LFX and improve its delivery. Key formulation parameters such as encapsulation efficiency, drug loading, in vitro release profile, and stability at 4\u00b0C, 25\u00b0C, and 40\u00b0C were assessed. The optimized formulations demonstrated acceptable stability and sustained drug release across the tested conditions. Biocompatibility studies revealed no significant cytotoxic effects, as confirmed by high cell viability percentages, indicating the safety of the nanoparticle systems. Furthermore, the nanoparticle-loaded formulations exhibited enhanced dissolution behavior and potent in vitro antimicrobial activity against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria (p<0.05). Pharmacokinetic studies revealed statistically significant improvements (p<0.05) in maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), elimination half-life (t1/2), and area under the curve (AUC) compared to conventional formulations. In vivo evaluation using an infection model confirmed the superior antimicrobial efficacy of the nanoparticle-based system. The results collectively indicate that nanoparticle-based delivery of LFX substantially improves its bioavailability, pharmacokinetic profile, and therapeutic efficacy. These findings support the potential application of nanotechnology in overcoming the limitations of conventional LFX therapy and enhancing clinical outcomes in bacterial infection treatment.\nKeywords: Nanoparticle, Levofloxacin, Bioavailability, Encapsulation efficiency, Drug release kinetics",

Widespread biomedical studies were carried out with the aim of exploring immunotherapy cancer therapeutics, and this review spotlights some mechanisms in which it was developed, namely immune checkpoint inhibitors (E.G PD-1/PD-L1, CTLA-4), adoptive cell therapy (e.g., CAR T-cell therapy), and cancer vaccines. Although it has shown clinical benefit in a number of cancer types, including melanoma and non-small-cell lung cancer, several challenges have dampened enthusiasm for this approach, from the differing patient response rates to toxicities. Nanotechnology in drug delivery systems must play a role in overcoming the same. Nanotechnology enables increased specificity and controlled drug release, improved solubility and bioavailability, can treat the tumor specifically, and localized drug delivery at the disease site decreases systemic toxicity. The review also features advances in the construction of lipid-based, polymeric, and inorganic nanoparticles that improve drug stability and allow the delivery of cotherapeutic agents. Nanotechnology-based delivery systems can be used alone or in combination with immunotherapy to assist in improving the immune response, gaining access to the tumor microenvironment, and overcoming biological barriers. Thus, the nano-DDS were both safe and effective in preclinical studies, and ongoing clinical trials have shown that they are capable of increasing the therapeutic index of anticancer drugs. Lastly, the review also discusses current challenges and regulatory issues in advancing these technologies and highlights the importance of further research to devise appropriate methodology for efficient functionalization of nanotechnology for individualized cancer solutions in cancer treatment.",

Block copolymers containing PEG have been widely used in nanodrug delivery systems such as solid lipid nanoparticles, polymeric nanoparticles, polymeric micelles, and liposomes. To date, although numerous PEGylated nanodrug delivery systems have been developed, only a few have been approved for clinical application. Poor safety and effectivity are important reasons for the high failure rate of nanodrug delivery system clinical trials. These factors are not only related to the loaded drugs and released drugs but are also related to the nanocarriers. Therefore, investigating the in vivo spatiotemporal fate of block copolymers containing PEG used in nanodrug delivery systems is necessary and important for evaluating their safety, efficacy, and toxicity. In this article, we will review the information that has been reported about the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of block copolymers containing PEG. We believe this review is helpful to understand the biologic fate of block copolymers containing PEG. This review describes pharmacokinetic study of block copolymers containing polyethylene glycol. The main focus of this paper is the in vivo fate of these polyethylene glycol-related copolymers after their release from nanocarriers.

Thermoresponsive nanocarriers (liposomes and polymeric networks) exploit local hyperthermia to trigger targeted payload release; however, their low stability and unpredictable fate in vivo have led to failure in clinical studies. To overcome these challenges, we reported first-of-its-kind thermoresponsive lipid nanoparticles (TLNs) that undergo solid-liquid phase transition under hyperthermia to release the payload. This study enabled TLNs with on-demand drug delivery functionality to breast cancer cells by incorporating magnetically activated iron oxide nanoparticles (\u03b3-Fe2O3) into a lauric and oleic acid-based phase-changing lipid-matrix to synthesize paclitaxel (PTX)- and \u03b3-Fe2O3-loaded TLNs (P-\u03b3-TLN). Critical independent variables were selected and then optimized using a central composite design to obtain the optimized formulation, P-\u03b3-TLN 12, with a size of \u223c183 nm, polydispersity of 0.50, zeta potential of -22 mV, and encapsulation efficiencies of 85% for PTX and 60.49% for \u03b3-Fe2O3. Thermoresponsive delivery was confirmed, with TLNs remaining relatively stable at 37 \u00b0C for 72 h, releasing only 34.26% of the drug, whereas exposure to 45 \u00b0C resulted in more than a two-fold increase, releasing 79.35% over the same period. Under an external alternating magnetic field, \u03b3-Fe2O3 generated hyperthermia and induced a phase transition in P-\u03b3-TLN, leading to abrupt drug release. Both \u03b3-Fe2O3 and TLNs exhibited high biocompatibility, but TLN encapsulation significantly improved uptake in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Under AMF, P-\u03b3-TLN showed enhanced PTX release, resulting in more potent cytotoxicity against MCF-7 cells. The combination of high payload capacity, stimuli-responsive release, thermotherapy, and enhanced chemotherapeutic response highlights the substantial potential for TLNs in cancer therapy.",

Thermoresponsive delivery was confirmed, with TLNs remaining relatively stable at 37 \u00b0C for 72 h, releasing only 34.26% of the drug, whereas exposure to 45 \u00b0C resulted in more than a two-fold increase, releasing 79.35% over the same period. Under an external alternating magnetic field, \u03b3-Fe2O3 generated hyperthermia and induced a phase transition in P-\u03b3-TLN, leading to abrupt drug release. Both \u03b3-Fe2O3 and TLNs exhibited high biocompatibility, but TLN encapsulation significantly improved uptake in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Under AMF, P-\u03b3-TLN showed enhanced PTX release, resulting in more potent cytotoxicity against MCF-7 cells. The combination of high payload capacity, stimuli-responsive release, thermotherapy, and enhanced chemotherapeutic response highlights the substantial potential for TLNs in cancer therapy.",

In addition, the lipid layer slows down the rate of polymer degradation of LPHNP products by limiting inward water diffusion and helps the sustained-release kinetics of loaded content (Hadinoto et al., 2013). The properties of LPHNPs advocate for their utility and prove advantageous over existing delivery vehicles (Zhang et al., 2008)91). Thus, well-designed LPHNPs contain hydrophobic polymeric core functions, whereas the surrounding lipid coat is a biocompatible shield and a barrier preventing the fast leakage of water-soluble drugs (Fang et al., 2010)(Cheow et al., 2011). Properties such as biocompatibility, biodegradability, sustained drug-release profiles, and greater loading capacity are attributed to a stable, high-payload, targeted drug-delivery system that might maximize chemotherapeutic efficacy against targeted cancer cells (90, 94).",

These lipid monolayer-coated polymeric nanoparticles are typically fabricated through a modified nanoprecipitation method, which involves sample heating, vortexing, and solvent evaporation. Herein we report a new and fast method to synthesize lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles with controllable and nearly uniform particle size. Using a bath sonication approach, we demonstrate that the whole hybrid nanoparticle synthesis process can be completed in about 5 min compared with a few hours for previous synthesis approaches. The size and polydispersity of the resulting nanoparticles can be readily controlled by tuning the relative concentrations of individual building components. Colloidal stability tests of the synthesized hybrid nanoparticles in PBS buffer and serum show no signs of aggregation over a period of 5 days. The present method improves the production rate of the hybrid nanoparticles by near 20-fold while not compromising the physicochemical properties of the particles. This work may facilitate the bench-to-bedside translation of lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles as a robust drug nanocarrier by allowing for fabricating a large amount of these nanoparticles at high production rate."

In addition, the lipid layer slows down the rate of polymer degradation of LPHNP products by limiting inward water diffusion and helps the sustained-release kinetics of loaded content (Hadinoto et al., 2013). The properties of LPHNPs advocate for their utility and prove advantageous over existing delivery vehicles (Zhang et al., 2008)91). Thus, well-designed LPHNPs contain hydrophobic polymeric core functions, whereas the surrounding lipid coat is a biocompatible shield and a barrier preventing the fast leakage of water-soluble drugs (Fang et al., 2010)(Cheow et al., 2011). Properties such as biocompatibility, biodegradability, sustained drug-release profiles, and greater loading capacity are attributed to a stable, high-payload, targeted drug-delivery system that might maximize chemotherapeutic efficacy against targeted cancer cells (90, 94)."

The application of nanotechnology has revolutionized the pharmaceutical industry and attracted increasing attention as a significant means for optimizing the delivery of chemotherapeutic agents and enhancing their efficiency and safety profiles. Nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) are lipid-based formulations that have been broadly studied as drug delivery systems. They have a solid matrix at room temperature and are considered superior to many other traditional lipid-based nanocarriers such as nanoemulsions, liposomes and solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) due to their enhanced physical stability, improved drug loading capacity, and biocompatibility. This review focuses on the latest advances in the use of NLCs as drug delivery systems and their preparation and characterization techniques with special emphasis on their applications as delivery systems for chemotherapeutic agents and different strategies for their use in tumor targeting."

                    "[160033493 | Ray et al. | 2019 | Citations: 33]": "Rationale: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the most widely used diagnostic tools in the clinic. In this setting, real-time monitoring of therapy and tumor site would give the clinicians a handle to observe therapeutic response and to quantify drug amount to optimize the treatment. In this work, we developed a liposome-based cargo (cancer drugs) delivery strategy that could simultaneously monitor the real-time alternating magnetic field-induced cargo release from the change in MRI relaxation parameter R1 and the location and condition of liposome from the change in R2. The tumor site can then be monitored during the cargo release because liposomes would passively target the tumor site through the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. Physical insights from the experimental results and corresponding Monte Carlo spin dynamics simulations were also discussed. Methods: Superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticles, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid gadolinium(III) (Gd(III)-DTPA), and a model cancer drug (fluorescein) were co-loaded in PEGylated thermosensitive liposomes. The liposomes were characterized by transmission electron cryo-microscopy (cryoTEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). Alternating magnetic field (AMF) was used to create controlled mild hyperthermia (39-42\u00b0C) and facilitate controlled cargo (fluorescein) release from the thermosensitive liposomes. MRI relaxation parameters, R1 and R2, were measured at room temperature. The temporal variation in R1 was used to obtain the temporal profile of cargo release. Due to their similar sizes, both the gadolinium and cargo (model cancer drug fluorescein) would come out of the liposomes together as a result of heating. The temporal variation in R2 was used to monitor SPIO nanoparticles to enhance the tumor contrast. Monte Carlo spin dynamics simulations were performed by solving the Bloch equations and modeling SPIO nanoparticles as magnetized impenetrable spheres. Results: TEM images and DLS measurements showed the diameter of the liposome nanoparticle ~ 200 nm. AMF heating showed effective release of the model drug. It was found that R1 increased linearly by about 70% and then saturated as the cargo release process was completed, while R2 remained approximately constant with an initial 7%-drop and then recovered. The linear increase in R1 is consistent with the expected linear cargo release with time upon AMF heating. Monte Carlo spin dynamics simulations suggest that the initial temporal fluctuation of R2 is due to the plausible changes of SPIO aggregation and the slow non-recoverable degradation of liposomal membrane that increases water permeability with time by the heating process. The simulations show an order of magnitude increase in R2 at higher water permeability. Conclusion: We have performed MR parameter study of the release of a cargo (model cancer drug, fluorescein) by magnetic heating from thermosensitive multifunctional liposomes loaded with dual contrast agents. The size of the liposome nanoparticles loaded with model cancer drug (fluorescein), gadolinium chelate, and SPIO nanoparticles was appropriate for a variety of cancer therapies. A careful and detailed analysis with theoretical explanation and simulation was carried out to investigate the correlation between MRI relaxation parameters, R1 and R2, and different cargo release fractions. We have quantified the cargo release using R1, which shows a linear relation between each other. This result provides a strong basis for the dosage control of drug delivered. On the other hand, the fairly stable R2 with almost constant value suggests that it could be used to monitor the position and condition of the liposomal site, as SPIO nanoparticles mostly remained in the aqueous core of the liposome. Because our synthesized SPIO-encapsulated liposomes could be targeted to tumor site passively by the EPR effect, or actively through magnetofection, this study provides a solid ground for developing MR cancer theranostics in combination of this nanostructure and AMF heating strategy. Furthermore, our simulation results predict a sharp increase in R2 during the AMF heating, which opens up the exciting possibility of high-resolution, high-contrast real-time imaging of the liposomal site during the drug release process, provided AMF heating could be incorporated into an MRI setup. Our use of the clinically approved materials, along with confirmation by theoretical simulations, make this technique a promising candidate for translational MR cancer theranostics.",
                    "[164953990 | Wang et al. | 2019 | Citations: 61]": "In recent decades, lipid-based nanoparticles (LN) have received considerable attention as nanoscale delivery systems to improve oral bioavailability of poorly absorbed bioactive compounds for health promotion and disease prevention. However, scientific studies on the biological fate of orally administered LN are very limited and the molecular mechanisms by which they are absorbed through the intestinal lumen into the circulation remain unclear. This paper aims to provide an overview of the biological fate of orally administered LN by reviewing recent studies on both cell and animal models. In general, the biological fate of ingested LN in the gastrointestinal tract is primarily determined by their initial physicochemical characteristics (such as the particle size, surface properties, composition and structure), and their absorption mainly occurs within the small intestine. In particular, depending upon the composition, LN can be either digestible or indigestible, with two distinct biological fates for each type of LN. The detailed absorption mechanisms and uptake pathways at molecular, cellular and whole body levels for each type of LN are discussed in detail. Limitations of current research and our vision for future directions to study the biological fate of ingested LN are also provided in this critical review."

Of all cancers, ranked by absolute years of life lost, brain and central nervous system cancer were classified in the nine position between 2006 and 2016. Glioblastoma is the most common malignant primary brain tumour and comprises 80% of malignant tumours. Therapeutic approach usually involves the combination of surgery and radiotherapy, which present a high risk for the patient and are not always effective in the most aggressive cases. Chemotherapy commonly includes a specific number of cycles given over a set period of time, in which patients receive one drug or a combination of different compounds. The difficulty of access for the neurosurgeon to remove the tumor, the limitation of the penetration of the antitumor agents caused by the blood-brain barrier and the serious adverse effects of these drugs significantly compromise the therapeutic success in these patients. To solve these problems and improve the effectiveness of existing treatments, as well as new molecules, the use of nanotechnology is arousing much interest in the last decades in this field. The use of polymeric and lipid based nanosystems are one of the best alternatives for the central delivery of drugs due to their versatility, easy manufacturing, biocompatibility, biodegradability and drug targeting, among other virtues. Thus, in this review we will explore the recent advances on latest anticancer agent's development associated to polymeric and lipid based nanocarriers as novel tool for the management of brain tumors.",

Conjugated polymer nanoparticles are profoundly flexible nano-organized materials that can conceivably discover applications in different branches of science and engineering, for example, optoelectronics, photonics, bio-imaging, bio-detecting and nanomedicine. Their desired sizes and unique properties, biocompatibility and low-toxicity make these materials profoundly appealing for the previously mentioned applications. Polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) are one of the most used nanomaterials for application in nanomedicine. Extreme intrigue lies in the capability of polymeric NPs to alter present-day medication. Usages of polymeric NPs incorporate medication delivery, for example, conjugation and entanglement of medications, prodrugs, stimuli responsive systems, imaging modalities, and theranostics. Biodegradable polymeric nano-structures (BPN) have indicated extraordinary guarantee in various remedial applications, for example, analysis, imaging, sedate delivery, beautifying agents, organ embeds and tissue designing. BPNs display better properties over their separate bulk materials, conquering the restrictions of customary polymers to address numerous significant clinical issues. Besides, the recent developments in research in various area of polymers can empower explicit functionalities of the polymeric nanostructures to be balanced for tunable applications. This concise review emphasizes the various preparative methods of polymeric nanoparticles developed in the last few decades and their uses in various branches of science, e.g., therapeutic, optoelectronic, catalytic and magnetic applications along with several challenging issues concerning the commercialization of emerging polymer-based therapeutics.

The advantages of solvent injection method include a fast production process, easiness of handling, and applicability in many laboratories without requirement of complicated instruments. The effects of formulations and process parameters of this method on the characteristics of the produced SLNs and NLCs have been investigated in several studies. This review describes the methods currently used to prepare SLNs and NLCs with focus on solvent injection method. We summarize recent development in SLNs and NLCs production using this technique.

In addition, some AMPs are also able to modulate the immune response, decreasing potential harmful effects such as sepsis. Despite these benefits, only a few formulations have successfully reached clinics. A common flaw in the druggability of AMPs is their poor pharmacokinetics, common to several peptide drugs, as they may be degraded by a myriad of proteases inside the organism. The combination of AMPs with carrier nanoparticles to improve delivery may enhance their half-life, decreasing the dosage and thus, reducing production costs and eventual toxicity.

The first-line treatment of cancer is the surgical removal of solid tumours, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. The systemic administration of the free drug is considered to be the main clinical failure of chemotherapy in cancer treatment, as limited drug concentration reaches the tumour site. Most of the active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) used in chemotherapy are highly cytotoxic to both cancer and normal cells. Accordingly, targeting the tumour vasculatures is essential for tumour treatment. In this context, encapsulation of anti-cancer drugs within the liposomal system offers secure platforms for the targeted delivery of anti-cancer drugs for the treatment of cancer. This, in turn, can be helpful for reducing the cytotoxic side effects of anti-cancer drugs on normal cells. This short-review focuses on the use of liposomes in anti-cancer drug delivery."

Adenosine, acting at its A2A receptor (A2AR), is a critical autocrine factor for maintenance of cartilage homeostasis and here we report that injection of liposomal suspensions of either adenosine or a selective A2AR agonist, CGS21680, significantly reduced OA cartilage damage in a murine model of obesity-induced OA. The same treatment also improved swelling and preserved cartilage in the affected knees in a rat model of established post-traumatic OA (PTOA). Differential expression analysis of mRNA from chondrocytes harvested from knees of rats with PTOA treated with liposomal A2AR agonist revealed downregulation of genes associated with matrix degradation and upregulation of genes associated with cell proliferation as compared to liposomes alone. Studies in vitro and in affected joints demonstrated that A2AR ligation increased the nuclear P-SMAD2/3/P-SMAD1/5/8 ratio, a change associated with repression of terminal chondrocyte differentiation. These results strongly suggest that targeting the A2AR is an effective approach to treat OA.",

Currently in the spotlight as vital components of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, LNPs play a key role in effectively protecting and transporting mRNA to cells. Liposomes, an early version of LNPs, are a versatile nanomedicine delivery platform. A number of liposomal drugs have been approved and applied to medical practice. Subsequent generations of lipid nanocarriers, such as solid lipid nanoparticles, nanostructured lipid carriers, and cationic lipid-nucleic acid complexes, exhibit more complex architectures and enhanced physical stabilities. With their ability to encapsulate and deliver therapeutics to specific locations within the body and to release their contents at a desired time, LNPs provide a valuable platform for treatment of a variety of diseases. Here, we present a landscape of LNP-related scientific publications, including patents and journal articles, based on analysis of the CAS Content Collection, the largest human-curated collection of published scientific knowledge. Rising trends are identified, such as nanostructured lipid carriers and solid lipid nanoparticles becoming the preferred platforms for numerous formulations. Recent advancements in LNP formulations as drug delivery platforms, such as antitumor and nucleic acid therapeutics and vaccine delivery systems, are discussed. Challenges and growth opportunities are also evaluated in other areas, such as medical imaging, cosmetics, nutrition, and agrochemicals. This report is intended to serve as a useful resource for those interested in LNP nanotechnologies, their applications, and the global research effort for their development.",

Currently, clinical nonsurgical treatments of OA are only limited to pain relief, anti-inflammation, and viscosupplementation. Developing disease-modifying OA drugs (DMOADs) is highly demanded for the efficient treatment of OA. As OA is a local disease, intra-articular (IA) injection directly delivers drugs to synovial joints, resulting in high-concentration drugs in the joint and reduced side effects, accompanied with traditional oral or topical administrations. However, the injected drugs are rapidly cleaved. By properly designing the drug delivery systems, prolonged retention time and targeting could be obtained. In this review, we summarize the drugs investigated for OA treatment and recent advances in the IA drug delivery systems, including micro- and nano-particles, liposomes, and hydrogels, hoping to provide some information for designing the IA injected formulations.",

To improve this drug's efficacy and reduce its acute and chronic toxicities, several lipid formulations of the drug have been developed, including AmBisome, a liposomal formulation of amphotericin B. The liposome is composed of high transition temperature phospholipids and cholesterol, designed to incorporate amphotericin B securely into the liposomal bilayer. AmBisome can bind to fungal cell walls, where the liposome is disrupted. The amphotericin B, after being released from the liposomes, is thought to transfer through the cell wall and bind to ergosterol in the fungal cell membrane. This mechanism of action of AmBisome results in its potent in vitro fungicidal activity while the integrity of the liposome is maintained in the presence of mammalian cells, for which it has minimal toxicity. In animal models, AmBisome is effective in treating both intracellular (leishmaniasis and histoplasmosis) and extracellular (candidosis and aspergillosis) systemic infections. Because of its low toxicity at the organ level, intravenous AmBisome can be safely delivered at markedly high doses of amphotericin B (1-30 mg/kg) for the treatment of systemic fungal infections. AmBisome has a circulating half-life of 5-24 h in animals, and in animal models appears to localize at sites of infection in the brain (cryptococcosis, aspergillosis, coccidioidomycosis), lungs (blastomycosis, paracoccidioidomycosis, aspergillosis) and kidneys (candidosis), delivering amphotericin B that remains bioavailable in tissues for several weeks following treatment."

We aimed to investigate whether solid-lipid nanoparticles containing essential oil of Zataria multiflora (ZMSLN) enhanced the anticancer efficacy of the essential oil against breast cancer (MDA-MB-468) and melanoma (A-375) cells. Results ZMSLN was prepared by the high-pressure homogenizer method; particle size 176\u2009\u00b1\u20098\u2009nm, polydispersity index 0.22\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1, entrapment efficiency 67\u2009\u00b1\u20095%.

Interestingly, after treating both cells with 75\u2009\u03bcg/mL of ZMSLN, their viabilities were reduced to under 13%. Conclusion The finding showed that ZMSLN had a distinct antiproliferative efficacy; it could thus be considered a green anticancer candidate for further in vivo and in vivo studies."

A significant step in the development of long-circulating liposomes came with inclusion of the synthetic polymer poly-(ethylene glycol) (PEG) in liposome composition. The presence of PEG on the surface of the liposomal carrier has been shown to extend blood-circulation time while reducing mononuclear phagocyte system uptake (stealth liposomes). This technology has resulted in a large number of liposome formulations encapsulating active molecules, with high target efficiency and activity. Further, by synthetic modification of the terminal PEG molecule, stealth liposomes can be actively targeted with monoclonal antibodies or ligands.

Morphology control with an enhanced photothermal response, minimal toxicity, and X-ray attenuation of polymer-based nanoparticles is a critical concern for image-guided photothermal therapy. Herein, we describe the simple design of cost-effective and degradable polycaprolactone-based plasmonic nanoshells for the integrated photothermolysis as well as localized imaging of cancer cells. The gold-deposited polycaprolactone-based plasmonic nanoshells (AuPCL NS) are synthesized in a scalable and facile way under ambient conditions. The synthesized nanoshells are monodisperse, fairly stable, and highly inert even at five times (250 \u03bcg/mL) the therapeutic concentration in a week-long test. AuPCL NS are capable of delivering standalone photothermal therapy for the complete ablation of cancer cells without using any anticancerous drugs and causing toxicity. It delivers the same therapeutic efficacy to different cancer cell lines, irrespective of their chemorefractory status and also works as a potential computed tomography contrast agent for the integrated imaging-directed photothermal cancer therapy. High biocompatibility, degradability, and promising photothermal efficacy of AuPCL NS are attractive aspects of this report that could open new horizons of localized plasmonic photothermal therapy for healthcare applications."

The use of systemic therapeutics remains one of the primary treatments for LC. However, the therapeutic efficacy of these agents is limited due to their associated severe adverse effects, systemic toxicity and poor selectivity. In contrast, pulmonary delivery of anticancer drugs can provide many advantages over conventional routes. The inhalation route allows the direct delivery of chemotherapeutic agents to the target LC cells with high local concertation that may enhance the antitumor activity and lead to lower dosing and fewer systemic toxicities. Nevertheless, this route faces by many physiological barriers and technological challenges that may significantly affect the lung deposition, retention, and efficacy of anticancer drugs. The use of lipid-based nanocarriers could potentially overcome these problems owing to their unique characteristics, such as the ability to entrap drugs with various physicochemical properties, and their enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect for passive targeting. Besides, they can be functionalized with different targeting moieties for active targeting.

The ability of nanoparticles to cross barriers depends on their morphological and surface properties such as size, surface chemistry and shape, among others. The effect of nanoparticle size on their membrane permeability has been well studied both experimentally and theoretically. However, less attention has been given to understand the role of nanoparticle shape in their translocation across biological barrier membranes. Here, we report on the influence of the nanoparticle's shape, surface chemistry and concentration on their permeation across a human intestinal apical cell membrane model. A representative multicomponent lipid bilayer model of the human intestinal apical membrane was built. The free energy of permeation of nanoparticles across the model lipid bilayer was calculated using multiple umbrella sampling simulations. The interaction of these nanoparticles with the model lipid bilayer was captured using extensive microsecond unrestrained molecular dynamics simulations. We observed that: (a) irrespective of the surface chemistry, the efficacy of nanoparticle penetration across the lipid layer was in the order of rod > disc > sphere; (b) irrespective of the shape, apolar and nonpolar nanoparticles were found to locate in the interior of the lipid bilayer, whereas charged and polar nanoparticles were either adsorbed on the lipid headgroups or remained in the water layer; (c) apolar and nonpolar disc shaped nanoparticles had higher efficacy in permeation across the lipid bilayer as compared to disc and sphere shaped nanoparticles; and (d) at a higher concentration of nanoparticles, sphere and disc shaped nanoparticles exhibited more agglomeration as compared to rod shaped nanoparticles. Based on these outcomes, a few nanoparticles were designed which penetrated readily into the lipid layer and these nanoparticles were also able to co-deliver a therapeutic protein inside the lipid layer. The apical model lipid membrane and protocols used in this study can thus be utilized for the in silico design of nanoparticles for the oral delivery of therapeutics.",

The broad potential of lipid-based delivery systems is highlighted by the recent approval of COVID-19 vaccines comprising lipid nanoparticles with encapsulated mRNA.

In this way, it is an interesting target as an interface for various types of drug delivery, specifically in the context of the treatment of several neuropathological conditions where the therapeutic agents cannot cross the BBB. Drug toxicity and on-target specificity are among some of the limitations associated with current neurotherapeutics. In recent years, advances in nanodrug delivery have enabled the carrier system containing the active therapeutic drug to target the signaling pathways and pathophysiology that are closely linked to central nervous system (CNS) disorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), Huntington\u2019s disease (HD), multiple sclerosis (MS), brain tumor, epilepsy, ischemic stroke, and neurodegeneration. At present, among the nano formulations, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) have emerged as a putative drug carrier system that can deliver the active therapeutics (drug-loaded SLNs) across the BBB at the target site of the brain, offering a novel approach with controlled drug delivery, longer circulation time, target specificity, and higher efficacy, and more importantly, reducing toxicity in a biomimetic way. This paper highlights the synthesis and application of SLNs as a novel nontoxic formulation strategy to carry CNS drugs across the BBB to improve the use of therapeutics agents in treating major neurological disorders in future clinics.",

Furthermore, imaging techniques can be utilized to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) effects, which helps target discovery and accelerates the development of LNP-based mRNA therapies. A thorough introduction and explanation of the components of LNPs and its functions along with various production methods of formulating LNPs are provided in this review.

Approximately 40% of them are lipophilic and are used for treating diseases through various delivery routes, including skin absorption, oral administration, and injection. However, as lipophilic drugs have a low solubility in the human body, drug delivery systems (DDSs) are being actively developed to increase drug bioavailability. Liposomes, micro-sponges, and polymer-based nanoparticles have been proposed as DDS carriers for lipophilic drugs. However, their instability, cytotoxicity, and lack of targeting ability limit their commercialization. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have fewer side effects, excellent biocompatibility, and high physical stability. LNPs are considered efficient vehicles of lipophilic drugs owing to their lipid-based internal structure. In addition, recent LNP studies suggest that the bioavailability of LNP can be increased through surface modifications, such as PEGylation, chitosan, and surfactant protein coating. Thus, their combinations have an abundant utilization potential in the fields of DDSs for carrying lipophilic drugs. In this review, the functions and efficiencies of various types of LNPs and surface modifications developed to optimize lipophilic drug delivery are discussed.",

It is important to elucidate the interactions between these barriers and LBNPs, which will guide more rational design of efficient NAD vehicles with low adverse effects and facilitate broader applications of nucleic acid therapeutics. This review describes the obstacles and challenges of biological barriers to NAD delivery at systemic, organ, sub\u2010organ, cellular, and subcellular levels. The strategies to overcome these barriers are comprehensively reviewed, mainly including physically/chemically engineering LBNPs and directly modifying physiological barriers by auxiliary treatments. Then the potentials and challenges for successful translation of these preclinical studies into the clinic are discussed. In the end, a forward look at the strategies on manipulating protein corona (PC) is addressed, which may pull off the trick of overcoming those physiological barriers and significantly improve the efficacy and safety of LBNP\u2010based NADs delivery.",

SLN are aqueous colloidal dispersions with solid biodegradable lipids as their matrix. SLN is produced using processes like solvent diffusion method and high-pressure homogenization, among others. Major benefits include regulated release, increased bioavailability, preservation of peptides and chemically labile compounds like retinol against degradation, cost-effective excipients, better drug integration, and a broad range of applications. Solid lipid nanoparticles can be administered via different routes, such as oral, parenteral, pulmonary, etc. SLN can be prepared by using high shear mixing as well as low shear mixing. The next generation of solid lipids, nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC), can reduce some of the drawbacks of SLN, such as its restricted capacity for drug loading and drug expulsion during storage. NLC are controlled nanostructured lipid particles that enhance drug loading.

These platforms safeguard siRNA from enzymatic degradation, enhance delivery efficiency, and enable tumor-specific targeting. However, each system has inherent trade-offs related to safety, biocompatibility, and efficiency. Here, key nanoparticle technologies and their advancements and limitations in, and their role in, optimizing siRNA delivery are highlighted (Gupta et al., 2019)(Chalbatani et al., 2019)...LNPs typically consist of ionizable lipids, phospholipids, cholesterol, and PEG-lipids, forming a highly stable delivery system that enables effective siRNA encapsulation and endosomal escape. Recent advancements have introduced ionizable lipids with optimized pKa values to enhance endosomal release and minimize cytotoxicity. However, challenges remain regarding potential immune activation and off-target effects. Strategies such as PEGylation or lipid chemical modifications have been employed to reduce immunogenicity and extend circulation time [47,48]. As an alternative to LNPs, polymeric nanoparticles, including biodegradable polymers such as poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and chitosan, provide a versatile platform for siRNA delivery. These systems offer controlled release profiles and high loading capacities. Innovations such as functionalized polymers with tumor-specific ligands (e.g., folic acid or RGD peptides) have enhanced selective tumor uptake. However, their immunogenic potential and potential for incomplete degradation in vivo are areas of active research to ensure safety and biocompatibility [47]48]. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have gathered attention due to their tunable size, ease of functionalization, and inherent biocompatibility.",

For silencing of specific genes involved in cell cycle, small/short interfering ribonucleic acids (siRNAs) are being used clinically. The siRNA-based RNAi is more efficient, specific and safe antisense technology than other RNAi approaches. The route of siRNA administration for siRNA therapy depends on the targeted site. However, certain hurdles like poor stability of siRNA, saturation, off-target effect, immunogenicity, anatomical barriers and non-targeted delivery restrict the successful siRNA therapy. Thus, advancement of an effective, secure, and long-term delivery system is prerequisite to the medical utilization of siRNA. Polycationic nanocarriers mediated targeted delivery system is an ideal system to remove these hurdles and to increase the blood retention time and rate of intracellular permeability.

Globally, cancer is the most common health concern disease that is affecting human beings. Great efforts have been made over the past decades in biology with the aim of searching novel and more efficient tools in therapy. Thus, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) have been considered one of the most noteworthy developments which are able to regulate gene expression following a process known as RNA interference (RNAi). RNAi is a post-transcriptional mechanism that involves the inhibition of gene expression through promoting cleavage on a specific area of a target messenger RNA (mRNA). This technology has shown promising therapeutic results for a good number of diseases, especially in cancer. However, siRNA therapeutics have to face important drawbacks in therapy including stability and successful siRNA delivery in vivo. In this regard, the development of effective siRNA delivery systems has helped addressing these issues by opening novel therapeutic windows which have allowed to build up important advances in Nanomedicine.

Recent advancements have introduced ionizable lipids with optimized pKa values to enhance endosomal release and minimize cytotoxicity. However, challenges remain regarding potential immune activation and off-target effects. Strategies such as PEGylation or lipid chemical modifications have been employed to reduce immunogenicity and extend circulation time [47,48]. As an alternative to LNPs, polymeric nanoparticles, including biodegradable polymers such as poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and chitosan, provide a versatile platform for siRNA delivery. These systems offer controlled release profiles and high loading capacities. Innovations such as functionalized polymers with tumor-specific ligands (e.g., folic acid or RGD peptides) have enhanced selective tumor uptake. However, their immunogenic potential and potential for incomplete degradation in vivo are areas of active research to ensure safety and biocompatibility [47]48]. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have gathered attention due to their tunable size, ease of functionalization, and inherent biocompatibility."

However, in those cases where a complete removal is not possible, radiation and chemotherapy are applied. Herein, the main challenges of chemotherapy, and how they can be overcome with the help of nanomedicine, are approached. Natural pathways to cross the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) are detailed, and different in vivo studies where these pathways are mimicked functionalizing the nanomaterial surface are shown. Later, lipid-based nanocarriers, such as liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles, and nanostructured lipid carriers, are presented. To finish, recent studies that have used lipid-based nanosystems carrying not only therapeutic agents, yet also magnetic nanoparticles, are described. Although the advantages of using these types of nanosystems are explained, including their biocompatibility, the possibility of modifying their surface to enhance the cell targeting, and their intrinsic ability of BBB crossing, it is important to mention that research in this field is still at its early stage, and extensive preclinical and clinical investigations are mandatory in the close future."

The biocompatibility and the physico-chemical diversity of lipids and their capacity to enhance the oral bioavailability of drugs have made this kind of nanocarriers very attractive systems for drug delivery. As a matter of fact, lipid-based formulations may positively influence drug absorption in several ways, e.g., by influencing the solubilization properties, preventing the drug precipitation upon intestinal dilution, increasing the membrane permeability, inhibiting the efflux transporters, reducing the CYP enzymes, or enhancing the lymphatic transport (Ganesan et al., 2017)(Shrestha et al., 2014).",

The use of lipids in drug delivery is no more a new trend now but is still the promising concept. Lipid-based drug delivery systems (LBDDS) are one of the emerging technologies designed to address challenges like the solubility and bioavailability of poorly water-soluble drugs. Lipid-based formulations can be tailored to meet a wide range of product requirements dictated by disease indication, route of administration, cost consideration, product stability, toxicity, and efficacy. These formulations are also a commercially viable strategy to formulate pharmaceuticals, for topical, oral, pulmonary, or parenteral delivery. In addition, lipid-based formulations have been shown to reduce the toxicity of various drugs by changing the biodistribution of the drug away from sensitive organs. However, the number of applications for lipid-based formulations has expanded as the nature and type of active drugs under investigation have become more varied. This paper mainly focuses on novel lipid-based formulations, namely, emulsions, vesicular systems, and lipid particulate systems and their subcategories as well as on their prominent applications in pharmaceutical drug delivery."

                "text": "\nNanoparticle-based drug delivery systems have emerged as revolutionary platforms for improving therapeutic efficacy while minimizing adverse effects. These systems typically range in size from 1-1000 nm and can be broadly categorized into three main types: lipid-based, polymeric, and inorganic nanoparticles. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are composed of phospholipids, cholesterol, and other lipid components that form bilayer structures capable of encapsulating both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs. Polymeric nanoparticles utilize natural or synthetic polymers such as PLGA, PLA, chitosan, or alginate to create biodegradable carriers. Inorganic nanoparticles include metal-based structures (gold, silver), silica nanoparticles, quantum dots, and carbon-based nanomaterials. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">\n\nEach nanoparticle type offers distinct advantages for drug delivery. LNPs excel in biocompatibility and can efficiently deliver nucleic acid therapeutics, as demonstrated by their use in COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. Polymeric nanoparticles provide sustained drug release profiles and tunable degradation rates. Inorganic nanoparticles often feature unique physical properties that enable additional functionalities such as imaging capabilities or photothermal effects. The field has seen significant clinical translation, with numerous FDA-approved nanoformulations including Doxil (liposomal doxorubicin), Abraxane (albumin-bound paclitaxel), and more recently, the LNP-based COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">\n\nThe safety and biocompatibility profiles of these various nanoparticle systems differ substantially based on their composition, surface properties, size, shape, and charge. These differences significantly impact their interactions with biological systems, including protein adsorption, cellular uptake, biodistribution, metabolism, and elimination pathways\u2014all factors that ultimately determine their safety profiles in clinical applications. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">",

The application of nanotechnology has revolutionized the pharmaceutical industry and attracted increasing attention as a significant means for optimizing the delivery of chemotherapeutic agents and enhancing their efficiency and safety profiles. Nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) are lipid-based formulations that have been broadly studied as drug delivery systems. They have a solid matrix at room temperature and are considered superior to many other traditional lipid-based nanocarriers such as nanoemulsions, liposomes and solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) due to their enhanced physical stability, improved drug loading capacity, and biocompatibility. This review focuses on the latest advances in the use of NLCs as drug delivery systems and their preparation and characterization techniques with special emphasis on their applications as delivery systems for chemotherapeutic agents and different strategies for their use in tumor targeting."

Moreover, lipid nanoparticles can encapsulate hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs, improve the bioavailability of low water-soluble actives, and protect them from premature elimination.

                            "Lipid-based nanoparticles have the advantage of being the least toxic carriers for in vivo applications. The lipids used to prepare biocompatible and biodegradable nanoparticles are usually naturally-occurring molecules with low acute and chronic toxicity. In the case of polymeric nanoparticles, the in vivo degradation of the polymer matrices might cause toxic effects (Ganesan et al., 2017). The biocompatibility and the physico-chemical diversity of lipids and their capacity to enhance the oral bioavailability of drugs have made this kind of nanocarriers very attractive systems for drug delivery. As a matter of fact, lipid-based formulations may positively influence drug absorption in several ways, e.g., by influencing the solubilization properties, preventing the drug precipitation upon intestinal dilution, increasing the membrane permeability, inhibiting the efflux transporters, reducing the CYP enzymes, or enhancing the lymphatic transport (Ganesan et al., 2017)(Shrestha et al., 2014)."

Among these particles, lipid-based nanoparticles pose a minimum threat for in vivo applications, and lipid-based nanoassemblies have been used to deliver DNA and RNA as well as drugs [176][177][178]. This has made lipid nanoparticles the most promising carriers for oral drug delivery [179]. The preparation of lipid nanoparticles (LNs) is performed by using low chronic and acute toxicity physiological lipids (biodegradable and biocompatible, which is similar to liposomes and nanoemulsions). In addition, their solid matrix offers the same protection as polymeric nanoparticles against chemical degradation under harsh biological environments and provides the maximum flexibility in regard to modifying drug release profiles [183]. However, in polymeric nanoparticles, toxic effects may be caused by the in vivo degradation of the polymer [184]."

Despite these promising features, rapid clearance from synovial fluid remains an issue for OA therapy (Cao et al., 2021). Other nanocarriers also show important limitations: exosomes display manufacturing challenges (Bousnaki et al., 2020) and inorganic NPs lack deeper toxicological assessment in literature (Choi et al., 2013).

                            "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have emerged across the pharmaceutical industry as promising vehicles to deliver a variety of therapeutics. Currently in the spotlight as vital components of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, LNPs play a key role in effectively protecting and transporting mRNA to cells. Liposomes, an early version of LNPs, are a versatile nanomedicine delivery platform. A number of liposomal drugs have been approved and applied to medical practice. Subsequent generations of lipid nanocarriers, such as solid lipid nanoparticles, nanostructured lipid carriers, and cationic lipid-nucleic acid complexes, exhibit more complex architectures and enhanced physical stabilities. With their ability to encapsulate and deliver therapeutics to specific locations within the body and to release their contents at a desired time, LNPs provide a valuable platform for treatment of a variety of diseases. Here, we present a landscape of LNP-related scientific publications, including patents and journal articles, based on analysis of the CAS Content Collection, the largest human-curated collection of published scientific knowledge. Rising trends are identified, such as nanostructured lipid carriers and solid lipid nanoparticles becoming the preferred platforms for numerous formulations. Recent advancements in LNP formulations as drug delivery platforms, such as antitumor and nucleic acid therapeutics and vaccine delivery systems, are discussed. Challenges and growth opportunities are also evaluated in other areas, such as medical imaging, cosmetics, nutrition, and agrochemicals. This report is intended to serve as a useful resource for those interested in LNP nanotechnologies, their applications, and the global research effort for their development."

Lipid nanocarriers such as liposomes, SLNs, and NLCs are ideal for incorporating both hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs, one of the major advantages of a combination of drugs that give dual targeting. They also have other advantages in terms of biocompatibility, shielding bioactive compounds from chemical deterioration, site-specific controlled drug delivery, and high drug loading capacity, these nanocarriers are superior to the others in many ways. Stability during sterilization and ease of scaling up are two more benefits. At last, there is no reported toxicity for SLNs and NLCs up to date. Physiological lipids, generally accepted as safe (GRAS) excipients, make up the majority of these nanocarriers [75]."

                            "In 2016, there were 17.2 million of cancer cases which caused 8.9 million of deaths worldwide. Of all cancers, ranked by absolute years of life lost, brain and central nervous system cancer were classified in the nine position between 2006 and 2016. Glioblastoma is the most common malignant primary brain tumour and comprises 80% of malignant tumours. Therapeutic approach usually involves the combination of surgery and radiotherapy, which present a high risk for the patient and are not always effective in the most aggressive cases. Chemotherapy commonly includes a specific number of cycles given over a set period of time, in which patients receive one drug or a combination of different compounds. The difficulty of access for the neurosurgeon to remove the tumor, the limitation of the penetration of the antitumor agents caused by the blood-brain barrier and the serious adverse effects of these drugs significantly compromise the therapeutic success in these patients. To solve these problems and improve the effectiveness of existing treatments, as well as new molecules, the use of nanotechnology is arousing much interest in the last decades in this field. The use of polymeric and lipid based nanosystems are one of the best alternatives for the central delivery of drugs due to their versatility, easy manufacturing, biocompatibility, biodegradability and drug targeting, among other virtues. Thus, in this review we will explore the recent advances on latest anticancer agent's development associated to polymeric and lipid based nanocarriers as novel tool for the management of brain tumors."

(13 sources)",
                "text": "\nPolymeric nanoparticles, while offering advantages in terms of structural integrity and controlled release profiles, exhibit several comparative limitations when assessed against lipid-based delivery systems. A primary concern is their higher toxicity potential, as the in vivo degradation of polymer matrices can release byproducts that cause adverse effects <Paper corpusId=\"253599392\" paperTitle=\"(Bezbaruah et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"53726556\" paperTitle=\"(Rakotoarisoa et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>. This toxicity risk is particularly problematic for long-term therapeutic applications or treatments requiring repeated administration.\n\nManufacturing challenges also present significant limitations for polymeric nanoparticles. Their production often necessitates toxic organic solvents, which raises concerns about residual solvent contamination in the final formulation <Paper corpusId=\"263453653\" paperTitle=\"(2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"56103812\" paperTitle=\"(Devrim et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>. Additionally, scale-up issues may complicate their transition from laboratory to industrial production, potentially affecting their commercial viability <Paper corpusId=\"263453653\" paperTitle=\"(2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nFor hydrophilic drugs in particular, polymeric nanoparticles demonstrate suboptimal encapsulation efficiency compared to lipid-based alternatives <Paper corpusId=\"56103812\" paperTitle=\"(Devrim et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>. This limitation restricts their utility for delivering water-soluble therapeutic agents, including many nucleic acid-based drugs that require effective encapsulation for protection against enzymatic degradation <Paper corpusId=\"275299864\" paperTitle=\"(Sousa et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nStability issues further compromise the performance of polymeric nanoparticles. They may exhibit drug leakage before reaching target tissues, undermining their effectiveness in controlled delivery applications <Paper corpusId=\"263453653\" paperTitle=\"(2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. Their interactions with the immune system can also lead to rapid clearance, limiting their circulation time and therapeutic window <Paper corpusId=\"275316417\" paperTitle=\"(Musielak et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nBiocompatibility concerns remain a significant drawback for polymeric systems compared to lipid-based alternatives. Multiple studies have confirmed that lipid nanocarriers demonstrate superior biocompatibility to polymeric nanoparticles <Paper corpusId=\"232016868\" paperTitle=\"(Edis et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"214643713\" paperTitle=\"(Haider et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"233396407\" paperTitle=\"(Thi et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. This biocompatibility difference is particularly relevant for applications targeting sensitive tissues such as the central nervous system, where polymeric nanoparticles may pose higher risks <Paper corpusId=\"275316417\" paperTitle=\"(Musielak et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"229416408\" paperTitle=\"(Iturrioz-Rodriguez et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe cytotoxicity profiles of polymeric nanoparticles have limited their clinical implementation, with preclinical studies raising safety concerns <Paper corpusId=\"233839166\" paperTitle=\"(Persano et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. As a response to these limitations, hybrid systems combining lipid shells with polymeric cores have emerged as a promising approach to mitigate polymer charge-associated toxicity while maintaining the structural advantages of polymeric systems <Paper corpusId=\"233839166\" paperTitle=\"(Persano et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"266732657\" paperTitle=\"(Emencheta et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nEconomic considerations also favor lipid-based systems over polymeric alternatives. Solid lipid nanoparticles are generally considered more economically efficient to produce than polymeric nanoparticles <Paper corpusId=\"236340600\" paperTitle=\"(Hazis et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>, making them potentially more accessible for widespread clinical application and commercialization.",

Among these particles, lipid-based nanoparticles pose a minimum threat for in vivo applications, and lipid-based nanoassemblies have been used to deliver DNA and RNA as well as drugs [176][177][178]. This has made lipid nanoparticles the most promising carriers for oral drug delivery [179]. The preparation of lipid nanoparticles (LNs) is performed by using low chronic and acute toxicity physiological lipids (biodegradable and biocompatible, which is similar to liposomes and nanoemulsions). In addition, their solid matrix offers the same protection as polymeric nanoparticles against chemical degradation under harsh biological environments and provides the maximum flexibility in regard to modifying drug release profiles [183]. However, in polymeric nanoparticles, toxic effects may be caused by the in vivo degradation of the polymer [184]."

The lipids used to prepare biocompatible and biodegradable nanoparticles are usually naturally-occurring molecules with low acute and chronic toxicity. In the case of polymeric nanoparticles, the in vivo degradation of the polymer matrices might cause toxic effects (Ganesan et al., 2017). The biocompatibility and the physico-chemical diversity of lipids and their capacity to enhance the oral bioavailability of drugs have made this kind of nanocarriers very attractive systems for drug delivery. As a matter of fact, lipid-based formulations may positively influence drug absorption in several ways, e.g., by influencing the solubilization properties, preventing the drug precipitation upon intestinal dilution, increasing the membrane permeability, inhibiting the efflux transporters, reducing the CYP enzymes, or enhancing the lymphatic transport (Ganesan et al., 2017)(Shrestha et al., 2014)."

Here, key nanoparticle technologies and their advancements and limitations in, and their role in, optimizing siRNA delivery are highlighted (Gupta et al., 2019)(Chalbatani et al., 2019)",
                            "LNPs typically consist of ionizable lipids, phospholipids, cholesterol, and PEG-lipids, forming a highly stable delivery system that enables effective siRNA encapsulation and endosomal escape. Recent advancements have introduced ionizable lipids with optimized pKa values to enhance endosomal release and minimize cytotoxicity. However, challenges remain regarding potential immune activation and off-target effects. Strategies such as PEGylation or lipid chemical modifications have been employed to reduce immunogenicity and extend circulation time [47,48]. As an alternative to LNPs, polymeric nanoparticles, including biodegradable polymers such as poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and chitosan, provide a versatile platform for siRNA delivery. These systems offer controlled release profiles and high loading capacities. Innovations such as functionalized polymers with tumor-specific ligands (e.g., folic acid or RGD peptides) have enhanced selective tumor uptake. However, their immunogenic potential and potential for incomplete degradation in vivo are areas of active research to ensure safety and biocompatibility [47]48]. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have gathered attention due to their tunable size, ease of functionalization, and inherent biocompatibility."

The application of nanotechnology has revolutionized the pharmaceutical industry and attracted increasing attention as a significant means for optimizing the delivery of chemotherapeutic agents and enhancing their efficiency and safety profiles. Nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) are lipid-based formulations that have been broadly studied as drug delivery systems. They have a solid matrix at room temperature and are considered superior to many other traditional lipid-based nanocarriers such as nanoemulsions, liposomes and solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) due to their enhanced physical stability, improved drug loading capacity, and biocompatibility. This review focuses on the latest advances in the use of NLCs as drug delivery systems and their preparation and characterization techniques with special emphasis on their applications as delivery systems for chemotherapeutic agents and different strategies for their use in tumor targeting."

The current treatments involve surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, being complete surgical resection the best option for the patient survival chances. However, in those cases where a complete removal is not possible, radiation and chemotherapy are applied. Herein, the main challenges of chemotherapy, and how they can be overcome with the help of nanomedicine, are approached. Natural pathways to cross the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) are detailed, and different in vivo studies where these pathways are mimicked functionalizing the nanomaterial surface are shown. Later, lipid-based nanocarriers, such as liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles, and nanostructured lipid carriers, are presented. To finish, recent studies that have used lipid-based nanosystems carrying not only therapeutic agents, yet also magnetic nanoparticles, are described. Although the advantages of using these types of nanosystems are explained, including their biocompatibility, the possibility of modifying their surface to enhance the cell targeting, and their intrinsic ability of BBB crossing, it is important to mention that research in this field is still at its early stage, and extensive preclinical and clinical investigations are mandatory in the close future."

In the last two decades, the use of nanodelivery systems has emerged as an effective way to potentiate the therapeutic properties of anti-cancer drugs by improving their solubility and stability, prolong drug half-lives in plasma, minimize drug's toxicity by reducing its off-target distribution, and promote drugs' accumulation at the desired target site. Liposomes and polymer nanoparticles are the most studied and have demonstrated to be the most effective delivery systems for anti-cancer drugs. However, both liposomes and polymeric nanoparticles suffer from limitations, including high instability, rapid drug release, limited drug loading capacity, low biocompatibility and lack of suitability for large-scale production. To overcome these limitations, lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles (LPHNPs) have been developed to merge the advantages of both lipid- and polymer-based nanocarriers, such as high biocompatibility and stability, improved drug loading and controlled release, as well as increased drug half-lives and therapeutic efficacy",
                            "the clinical implementation of polymeric NPs remains limited, as there are still concerns regarding their safety profile. Preclinical studies have provided evidences that the use of LPHNPs can offer the potential to integrate the advantages of both lipid-and polymeric-based systems in the same platform and overcome the major limitations of polymeric NPs related mostly with toxicity concerns. Indeed, the introduction of an outer layer lipid shell could consent to modulate properties like hydrophobicity, stimuli-triggered drug release, targeting efficiency and polymer chargeassociated toxicity."

                            "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and malignant neoplasia having origin in the brain. The current treatments involve surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, being complete surgical resection the best option for the patient survival chances. However, in those cases where a complete removal is not possible, radiation and chemotherapy are applied. Herein, the main challenges of chemotherapy, and how they can be overcome with the help of nanomedicine, are approached. Natural pathways to cross the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) are detailed, and different in vivo studies where these pathways are mimicked functionalizing the nanomaterial surface are shown. Later, lipid-based nanocarriers, such as liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles, and nanostructured lipid carriers, are presented. To finish, recent studies that have used lipid-based nanosystems carrying not only therapeutic agents, yet also magnetic nanoparticles, are described. Although the advantages of using these types of nanosystems are explained, including their biocompatibility, the possibility of modifying their surface to enhance the cell targeting, and their intrinsic ability of BBB crossing, it is important to mention that research in this field is still at its early stage, and extensive preclinical and clinical investigations are mandatory in the close future."

                            "For instance, lipid-based nanoparticles, are generally considered biocompatible. The unique properties of lipids, such as biodegradability and biocompatibility, add to drug bioavailability through their specialized transport pathways. Hence, lipid-based particles improve gastrointestinal absorption and solubilization of poorly bioavailable drugs by facilitating selective lymphatic transport. Still, they may trigger immune responses or accumulate in the liver and spleen, leading to potential organ toxicity (Wang et al., 2024) . Studies (Yuan et al., 2024)(Albertsen et al., 2022) have reported that cationic lipid nanoparticles can be cytotoxic due to their interaction with cell membranes. However, neutral or anionic formulations, such as those used in our study, have demonstrated relatively safer profiles."

They are considered as ideal drug delivery systems due to their excellent biocompatibility and low toxicity, as well as for encapsulating both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drug cargos (Adler-Moore et al., 2002)(Corciulo et al., 2020). Despite these promising features, rapid clearance from synovial fluid remains an issue for OA therapy (Cao et al., 2021). Other nanocarriers also show important limitations: exosomes display manufacturing challenges (Bousnaki et al., 2020) and inorganic NPs lack deeper toxicological assessment in literature (Choi et al., 2013). Finally, the clinical application of micelles and dendrimers is still hampered by the non-encapsulation of hydrophilic drugs and toxicity concerns (jin, 2020)."

                            "When comparing the advantages and disadvantages of different types of nanomaterial platforms for drug delivery, lipid-based nanoparticles, including liposomes, present several advantages. They are biocompatible, biodegradable, and can encapsulate both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs with a high loading capacity. They also enable controlled drug release and can be tailored for specific properties. However, conventional liposomes are quickly cleared from the bloodstream, limiting their effectiveness. This limitation has led to the development of stealth liposomes with extended circulation time. Additionally, although strategies like receptor targeting and stimuli-responsive drug release enhance their efficacy, another limitation is the possibility of leakage and fusion of encapsulated drug/molecules [60,116].\n\nIn comparison, polymer-based platforms, including polymer-drug conjugates, polymeric micelles, and dendrimers, offer ease of synthesis, high stability, controlled drug release, and low toxicity [118]. Polymer-drug conjugates can enhance pharmacokinetic properties and reduce side effects [119]. Polymeric micelles possess advantages over other polymeric drug carriers due to their inherent self-assembly properties, making them easier to fabricate [120]. Dendrimers, while versatile, can be toxic to normal cells due to their strong interaction with cell membranes [121].\n\nInorganic nanoparticles, like gold and silver nanoparticles, offer high stability and reduced drug leakage, making them suitable for drug delivery."

These platforms safeguard siRNA from enzymatic degradation, enhance delivery efficiency, and enable tumor-specific targeting. However, each system has inherent trade-offs related to safety, biocompatibility, and efficiency. Here, key nanoparticle technologies and their advancements and limitations in, and their role in, optimizing siRNA delivery are highlighted (Gupta et al., 2019)(Chalbatani et al., 2019)",
                            "LNPs typically consist of ionizable lipids, phospholipids, cholesterol, and PEG-lipids, forming a highly stable delivery system that enables effective siRNA encapsulation and endosomal escape. Recent advancements have introduced ionizable lipids with optimized pKa values to enhance endosomal release and minimize cytotoxicity. However, challenges remain regarding potential immune activation and off-target effects. Strategies such as PEGylation or lipid chemical modifications have been employed to reduce immunogenicity and extend circulation time [47,48]. As an alternative to LNPs, polymeric nanoparticles, including biodegradable polymers such as poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and chitosan, provide a versatile platform for siRNA delivery. These systems offer controlled release profiles and high loading capacities. Innovations such as functionalized polymers with tumor-specific ligands (e.g., folic acid or RGD peptides) have enhanced selective tumor uptake. However, their immunogenic potential and potential for incomplete degradation in vivo are areas of active research to ensure safety and biocompatibility [47]48]. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have gathered attention due to their tunable size, ease of functionalization, and inherent biocompatibility."

                            "LPHNPs offer a versatile drug-delivery system with better drug entrapment, controlled and sustained drug release, great in vitro and in vivo stability (Hadinoto et al., 2013). In addition, the lipid layer slows down the rate of polymer degradation of LPHNP products by limiting inward water diffusion and helps the sustained-release kinetics of loaded content (Hadinoto et al., 2013). The properties of LPHNPs advocate for their utility and prove advantageous over existing delivery vehicles (Zhang et al., 2008)91). Thus, well-designed LPHNPs contain hydrophobic polymeric core functions, whereas the surrounding lipid coat is a biocompatible shield and a barrier preventing the fast leakage of water-soluble drugs (Fang et al., 2010)(Cheow et al., 2011). Properties such as biocompatibility, biodegradability, sustained drug-release profiles, and greater loading capacity are attributed to a stable, high-payload, targeted drug-delivery system that might maximize chemotherapeutic efficacy against targeted cancer cells (90, 94)."

These lipid monolayer-coated polymeric nanoparticles are typically fabricated through a modified nanoprecipitation method, which involves sample heating, vortexing, and solvent evaporation. Herein we report a new and fast method to synthesize lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles with controllable and nearly uniform particle size. Using a bath sonication approach, we demonstrate that the whole hybrid nanoparticle synthesis process can be completed in about 5 min compared with a few hours for previous synthesis approaches. The size and polydispersity of the resulting nanoparticles can be readily controlled by tuning the relative concentrations of individual building components. Colloidal stability tests of the synthesized hybrid nanoparticles in PBS buffer and serum show no signs of aggregation over a period of 5 days. The present method improves the production rate of the hybrid nanoparticles by near 20-fold while not compromising the physicochemical properties of the particles. This work may facilitate the bench-to-bedside translation of lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles as a robust drug nanocarrier by allowing for fabricating a large amount of these nanoparticles at high production rate."

                            "Current therapies are still ineffective in completely eradicating the disease. In the last two decades, the use of nanodelivery systems has emerged as an effective way to potentiate the therapeutic properties of anti-cancer drugs by improving their solubility and stability, prolong drug half-lives in plasma, minimize drug's toxicity by reducing its off-target distribution, and promote drugs' accumulation at the desired target site. Liposomes and polymer nanoparticles are the most studied and have demonstrated to be the most effective delivery systems for anti-cancer drugs. However, both liposomes and polymeric nanoparticles suffer from limitations, including high instability, rapid drug release, limited drug loading capacity, low biocompatibility and lack of suitability for large-scale production. To overcome these limitations, lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles (LPHNPs) have been developed to merge the advantages of both lipid- and polymer-based nanocarriers, such as high biocompatibility and stability, improved drug loading and controlled release, as well as increased drug half-lives and therapeutic efficacy",
                            "the clinical implementation of polymeric NPs remains limited, as there are still concerns regarding their safety profile. Preclinical studies have provided evidences that the use of LPHNPs can offer the potential to integrate the advantages of both lipid-and polymeric-based systems in the same platform and overcome the major limitations of polymeric NPs related mostly with toxicity concerns. Indeed, the introduction of an outer layer lipid shell could consent to modulate properties like hydrophobicity, stimuli-triggered drug release, targeting efficiency and polymer chargeassociated toxicity."

In the past few decades, nanoparticles have been explored intensely to diagnose, prevent and treat malignancy due to their good penetrability and better targeting. However, most nanocarriers have poor biodegradation and can be discharged out of the body quickly or cleared by immune cells while failing to obtain effective drug concentration at the specific sites. The emergence of biological membrane encapsulation technology relieves the fast clearance of antitumor drugs and reduces toxicity in vivo.

                            "In recent years, the development of nanoparticles has expanded into a broad range of clinical applications. Nanoparticles have been developed to overcome the limitations of free therapeutics and navigate biological barriers \u2014 systemic, microenvironmental and cellular \u2014 that are heterogeneous across patient populations and diseases. Overcoming this patient heterogeneity has also been accomplished through precision therapeutics, in which personalized interventions have enhanced therapeutic efficacy. However, nanoparticle development continues to focus on optimizing delivery platforms with a one-size-fits-all solution. As lipid-based, polymeric and inorganic nanoparticles are engineered in increasingly specified ways, they can begin to be optimized for drug delivery in a more personalized manner, entering the era of precision medicine. In this Review, we discuss advanced nanoparticle designs utilized in both non-personalized and precision applications that could be applied to improve precision therapies. We focus on advances in nanoparticle design that overcome heterogeneous barriers to delivery, arguing that intelligent nanoparticle design can improve efficacy in general delivery applications while enabling tailored designs for precision applications, thereby ultimately improving patient outcome overall. Advances in nanoparticle design could make substantial contributions to personalized and non-personalized medicine. In this Review, Langer, Mitchell, Peppas and colleagues discuss advances in nanoparticle design that overcome heterogeneous barriers to delivery, as well as the challenges in translating these design improvements into personalized medicine approaches."

Initial concerns regarding the safety of LNPs have been largely addressed through the development of reliable GRAS-regulated lipids, cGMP-grade manufacturing processes, and comprehensive preclinical data on their absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion (ADME) and toxicity profiles, followed by successful first-in-human studies <Paper corpusId=\"252145310\" paperTitle=\"(Chaudhuri et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nSolid lipid nanoparticles have particularly stood out in safety assessments. According to multiple studies, SLNs do not display the limitations associated with polymeric nanoparticles and liposomes, including challenges related to sterilization, toxicity, and long-term stability <Paper corpusId=\"258560933\" paperTitle=\"(Moghimipour et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"233390434\" paperTitle=\"(Dhiman et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. Blood compatibility studies have also confirmed the biocompatibility of SLNs in preclinical evaluations <Paper corpusId=\"258560933\" paperTitle=\"(Moghimipour et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This favorable safety profile is attributed to their formulation with biocompatible lipids, which ensures minimal toxicity and adverse reactions while allowing for various administration routes including oral, topical, parenteral, and ocular applications <Paper corpusId=\"261079954\" paperTitle=\"(Kapoor et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe biocompatibility of lipid nanocarriers stems from their unique properties. The biodegradability and biocompatibility of lipids contribute to enhanced drug bioavailability through specialized transport pathways, improving gastrointestinal absorption and solubilization of poorly bioavailable drugs by facilitating selective lymphatic transport <Paper corpusId=\"276670591\" paperTitle=\"(Ali et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>. However, important distinctions exist between different lipid formulations.

These include concerns about potential toxicity under certain conditions, scalability of production processes, regulatory approval hurdles, and the need for more comprehensive in vivo studies to fully understand their long-term effects and efficacy <Paper corpusId=\"272340496\" paperTitle=\"(Giordano et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.

                            "Nanotechnology has made a great impact on the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, food, and cosmetics industries. More than 40% of the approved drugs are lipophilic and have poor solubility. This is the major rate-limiting step that influences the release profile and bioavailability of drugs. Several approaches have been reported to administer lipophilic drugs with improved solubility and bioavailability. Nanotechnology plays a crucial role in the targeted delivery of poorly soluble drugs. Nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems can be classified as solid lipid nanoparticulate drug delivery systems, emulsion-based nanodrug delivery systems, vesicular drug delivery systems, etc. Nanotechnology presents a new frontier in research and development to conquer the limitations coupled with the conventional drug delivery systems through the formation of specific functionalized particles. This review presents a bird's eye view on various aspects of lipid nanoparticles as carriers of bioactive molecules that is, synthesis, characterization, advantage, disadvantage, toxicity, and application in the medical field. Update on recent development in terms of patents and clinical trials of solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) and nanostructure lipid carriers (NLCs) have also been discussed in this article."

                            "One of the key advantages of SLNs is their ability to encapsulate both hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs, offering versatility in drug delivery (Duan et al., 2020). The solid lipid matrix ensures drug stability and improves bioavailability of the encapsulated drugs. SLNs also demonstrate impressive drug targeting capabilities due to their small particle size. This enables efficient cellular uptake and facilitates targeted delivery to specific tissues or cells. Surface modifications of SLNs can further enhance their targeting ability, leading to improved therapeutic efficacy and minimized off-target effects. Controlled and sustained drug release is another significant feature of SLNs. The solid lipid matrix governs the release kinetics of drugs, resulting in a controlled and prolonged release profile. This feature is particularly advantageous for drugs requiring sustained therapeutic concentrations or those with narrow therapeutic windows. Furthermore, SLNs exhibit excellent biocompatibility and safety profiles, as they are formulated with biocompatible lipids. This ensures minimal toxicity and adverse reactions, allowing for various administration routes, such as oral, topical, parenteral, and ocular applications"

The unique properties of lipids, such as biodegradability and biocompatibility, add to drug bioavailability through their specialized transport pathways. Hence, lipid-based particles improve gastrointestinal absorption and solubilization of poorly bioavailable drugs by facilitating selective lymphatic transport. Still, they may trigger immune responses or accumulate in the liver and spleen, leading to potential organ toxicity (Wang et al., 2024) . Studies (Yuan et al., 2024)(Albertsen et al., 2022) have reported that cationic lipid nanoparticles can be cytotoxic due to their interaction with cell membranes. However, neutral or anionic formulations, such as those used in our study, have demonstrated relatively safer profiles."

                "text": "\nWhile lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have demonstrated superior biocompatibility compared to polymeric and inorganic alternatives, the field of nanoparticle-based drug delivery still faces several critical challenges in safety assessment that must be addressed before widespread clinical adoption. A primary concern is the potential for certain lipid formulations to trigger immune responses or accumulate in organs such as the liver and spleen, which could lead to toxicity in specific contexts <Paper corpusId=\"275299864\" paperTitle=\"(Sousa et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>. Even with advances in LNP development, including the introduction of ionizable lipids with optimized properties to enhance endosomal release and minimize cytotoxicity, challenges regarding immune activation and off-target effects persist <Paper corpusId=\"275299864\" paperTitle=\"(Sousa et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe scalability of production processes represents another significant hurdle for all nanoparticle types. Manufacturing challenges can affect batch-to-batch reproducibility, potentially compromising safety profiles when transitioning from laboratory to industrial production <Paper corpusId=\"272340496\" paperTitle=\"(Giordano et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. This issue is particularly relevant for complex formulations like lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles, where the development of consistent, scalable manufacturing protocols remains an ongoing challenge <Paper corpusId=\"234309593\" paperTitle=\"(Chouhan et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nRegulatory approval pathways present additional complexities in safety assessment. Despite progress with reliable GRAS-regulated lipids, cGMP-grade manufacturing processes, and comprehensive preclinical ADME and toxicity data <Paper corpusId=\"252145310\" paperTitle=\"(Chaudhuri et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>, regulatory bodies still require extensive safety documentation that can vary across different jurisdictions. For inorganic nanoparticles specifically, a notable lack of comprehensive toxicological assessment in the literature further complicates their clinical translation <Paper corpusId=\"254342017\" paperTitle=\"(Pontes et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nLong-term safety evaluation remains perhaps the most critical challenge across all nanoparticle types. The need for more comprehensive in vivo studies to fully understand the chronic effects of repeated administration is widely acknowledged <Paper corpusId=\"272340496\" paperTitle=\"(Giordano et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. This is particularly important for polymeric nanoparticles, where concerns about incomplete degradation in vivo and immunogenic potential require ongoing research to ensure safety and biocompatibility <Paper corpusId=\"275299864\" paperTitle=\"(Sousa et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nFuture advances in nanoparticle safety assessment will likely focus on developing standardized testing protocols that can evaluate biocompatibility across different biological systems. For polymeric nanoparticles, research is increasingly directed toward using biocompatible and biodegradable polymers such as PLGA, chitosan, or gelatin to mitigate potential toxicity concerns <Paper corpusId=\"272766688\" paperTitle=\"(Vasukutty et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. Similarly, inorganic nanoparticles are being carefully designed with consideration for composition and surface properties to minimize potential toxicity and interactions with the immune system <Paper corpusId=\"272766688\" paperTitle=\"(Vasukutty et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nDespite these challenges, the inherent biocompatibility of lipid-based systems, which mimic the structure of biological membranes, continues to position them favorably in the safety landscape <Paper corpusId=\"267053919\" paperTitle=\"(Trucillo, 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. As research progresses, addressing these safety assessment challenges will be crucial for unlocking the full therapeutic potential of nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems while ensuring patient safety remains the paramount consideration.",

These platforms safeguard siRNA from enzymatic degradation, enhance delivery efficiency, and enable tumor-specific targeting. However, each system has inherent trade-offs related to safety, biocompatibility, and efficiency. Here, key nanoparticle technologies and their advancements and limitations in, and their role in, optimizing siRNA delivery are highlighted (Gupta et al., 2019)(Chalbatani et al., 2019)",

Recent advancements have introduced ionizable lipids with optimized pKa values to enhance endosomal release and minimize cytotoxicity. However, challenges remain regarding potential immune activation and off-target effects. Strategies such as PEGylation or lipid chemical modifications have been employed to reduce immunogenicity and extend circulation time [47,48]. As an alternative to LNPs, polymeric nanoparticles, including biodegradable polymers such as poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and chitosan, provide a versatile platform for siRNA delivery. These systems offer controlled release profiles and high loading capacities. Innovations such as functionalized polymers with tumor-specific ligands (e.g., folic acid or RGD peptides) have enhanced selective tumor uptake. However, their immunogenic potential and potential for incomplete degradation in vivo are areas of active research to ensure safety and biocompatibility [47]48]. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have gathered attention due to their tunable size, ease of functionalization, and inherent biocompatibility."

                            "Lipid based nanoparticles (LNPs) and liposomes were the first nanocarriers approved by FDA and have many therapeutic applications, such as the current COVID-19 mRNA-LNPs vaccines (Tenchov et al., 2021). They are considered as ideal drug delivery systems due to their excellent biocompatibility and low toxicity, as well as for encapsulating both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drug cargos (Adler-Moore et al., 2002)(Corciulo et al., 2020). Despite these promising features, rapid clearance from synovial fluid remains an issue for OA therapy (Cao et al., 2021). Other nanocarriers also show important limitations: exosomes display manufacturing challenges (Bousnaki et al., 2020) and inorganic NPs lack deeper toxicological assessment in literature (Choi et al., 2013). Finally, the clinical application of micelles and dendrimers is still hampered by the non-encapsulation of hydrophilic drugs and toxicity concerns (jin, 2020)."

Polymeric nanoparticles will leverage biocompatible and biodegradable polymers such as PLGA, chitosan, or gelatin to mitigate potential toxicity concerns. Enhanced drug loading capacities will be achieved through refined polymer compositions and nanoparticle formulations, while surface modifications promise improved stability. Targeted delivery mechanisms will be realized through the strategic conjugation of nanoparticles with ligands or antibodies that bind specifically to receptors on HIV-infected cells. Lipid nanoparticles will be meticulously engineered with tailored lipid compositions to enhance biocompatibility and reduce toxicity risks. Advanced encapsulation techniques and the use of lipids with superior drug solubility will further optimize drug loading capacities. Stability will be bolstered through the incorporation of stabilizers like cholesterol or PEGylation, complemented by targeted delivery facilitated by surface modifications employing ligands or antibodies designed for HIV-infected cells. \n\nInorganic nanoparticles, carefully designed with consideration for composition and surface properties, will aim to minimize potential toxicity and interactions with the immune system. Strategies including porous structures and drug incorporation into the nanoparticle matrix will enhance drug loading capacities. Targeted delivery will be achieved through conjugation with ligands or antibodies specific to HIV-infected cells. Research will additionally explore the impact of inorganic nanoparticles on HIV replication and latency, providing critical insights into their effects on the immune system. Comprehensive evaluation through rigorous in vitro and in vivo studies will assess the safety, efficacy, and targeted delivery capabilities of these innovative nanocarriers."
