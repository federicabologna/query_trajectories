                    "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) as nanocarriers for the delivery of oligonucleotide-based therapeutics have sparked a profound change in the industry sector, due to their success in delivering vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic. The successful global implementation of LNPs has seen a rapid growth in research into their applications for the delivery of cargo in a range of therapy areas of unmet clinical need. Alterations in LNP constituent lipids and ratios have led to the discovery of a broad spectrum of prospective nanomedicine candidates in pharmaceutical industry pipelines, increasing the popularity of LNPs and their versatility and applicability to a diverse molecular portfolio [1][2][3][4][5]. \n\nThe successful clinical and commercial translation of LNPs for oligonucleotide delivery depends on acceptable formulation physicochemical stability of the nanocarrier during its shelf life, and the ability to protect oligonucleotide cargo from premature degradation. Highlighted by recent reviews [6,7], there is a critical need for the development of orthogonal analytical pipelines to profile prototype LNP physicochemical attributes during early formulation development stages. Once manufactured, the LNP formulation critical quality attributes (CQAs) are quantified using established techniques, such as dynamic light scattering (DLS: size and polydispersity), electrophoretic light scattering (ELS: zeta potential) and the RiboGreen\u2122 assay (drug encapsulation efficiency and recovery) [8][9][10]. Due to significant research interest and field novelty, the characterisation of prototype LNP candidates remains on a case-by-case basis. Continuing the process to harmonise the measurement of LNP physicochemical attributes, the Nanotechnology Characterisation Laboratory (NCL) and European NCL have issued guidelines for the analysis of prototype nanoparticulate formulations [11][12][13]; they recommend the use of at least one low-resolution technique and an orthogonal high-resolution technique for the measurement of nanoparticle size, ensuring that robust and representative results are obtained while standardised reference materials are under development.",

                    "text": "Interest in the use of LNPs as a drug delivery platform for gene delivery has seen an exponential increase over the past decade, with the regulatory approval of three LNP-based nanomedicine products: one therapeutic, and two vaccines for use in clinical settings. Since oligonucleotides encapsulated in LNPs can consist of a range of constituents, screening of prototype formulations during early development is crucial. As the range of academic and industrial applications of LNPs has seen tremendous growth, established techniques within the nanomedicine field have translated into adopted routine techniques for characterising the physicochemical attributes of LNP formulation candidates. Trend analysis of LNP research highlights that novel high-resolution analytical pipelines have not experienced an equivalent growth in their implementation in line with advancements in lipid research and they remain under-utilised for studying prototype formulations (figure 1). \n\nThe goal of this study was to apply high-resolution analytical techniques for profiling LNP nanomedicine physicochemical properties during early prototype development to facilitate clinical translation for therapeutic applications. In this work we use DOTAP-LNPs as a model LNP system, using PolyA as a model payload. We report the evaluation of process parameter manufacture and purification steps on LNP physical parameters, and an assessment of their physicochemical stability under refrigerated and ultra-low temperature storage (\u221280 \u2022 C) conditions using increasing-resolution orthogonal techniques. These advanced techniques provide deeper insights into LNP CQAs, enabling better control over CQAs and thereby advancing their translation. \n\nAnalysis of process parameter samples demonstrated that post-dialysis exchange of manufacturing buffer to formulation storage buffer resulted in unmasking of surface charges, increasing the LNP particle size distribution through sub-population formation and decreasing PolyA recovery (table S2). Our results highlight the importance of filter membrane selection. Both the PES and PVDF membranes that were selected were hydrophilic and low-binding: thus, ideally suited to biological aqueous formulated samples. The PVDF membrane contains electronegative fluoride groups, whereas PES contains sulfone moieties.",

LNPs are composed of five main excipients: (i) the oligonucleotide active pharmaceutical ingredient [14,15], (ii) an ionisable/cationic main lipid [16][17][18], (iii) sterols [16][17][18], (iv) helper phospholipids [19,20], and (v) polyethylene glycol functionalised lipids [21][22][23]. \n\nOrthogonal analytical techniques measure equivalent CQAs via differing physical principles.

Rattray\n## Abstract\nLipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have become a major disruptor within the drug delivery field of complex RNA molecules. The wide applicability of prototype nanomedicines has the potential to fill clinical requirements for use against current untreatable diseases. The uptake and implementation of analytical technologies to evaluate these prototype nanomedicines have not experienced similar growth rates, thus hindering the translation of LNPs. Here, we evaluate a model RNA-LNP formulation with a selection of routine and high-resolution orthogonal analytical techniques across studies on the manufacturing process parameter impact and formulation stability evaluation under refrigerated and ultra-low temperatures. We analysed a model cationic RNA-complexed LNP formulation via the process impact on formulation critical quality attributes, short-term refrigerated stability evaluation and frozen-storage stability using zetasizer dynamic light scattering and nanoparticle tracking analysis. We also evaluated freeze-/thaw-induced stress on LNP formulation using high-resolution field-flow fractionation. Statistical analysis and correlations between techniques were conducted to further enhance our understanding of LNP formulation design and its physicochemical attributes to facilitate LNP formulation clinical translation.\n## Introduction\nLipid nanoparticles (LNPs) as nanocarriers for the delivery of oligonucleotide-based therapeutics have sparked a profound change in the industry sector, due to their success in delivering vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic. The successful global implementation of LNPs has seen a rapid growth in research into their applications for the delivery of cargo in a range of therapy areas of unmet clinical need. Alterations in LNP constituent lipids and ratios have led to the discovery of a broad spectrum of prospective nanomedicine candidates in pharmaceutical industry pipelines, increasing the popularity of LNPs and their versatility and applicability to a diverse molecular portfolio [1][2][3][4][5]. \n\nThe successful clinical and commercial translation of LNPs for oligonucleotide delivery depends on acceptable formulation physicochemical stability of the nanocarrier during its shelf life, and the ability to protect oligonucleotide cargo from premature degradation. Highlighted by recent reviews [6,7], there is a critical need for the development of orthogonal analytical pipelines to profile prototype LNP physicochemical attributes during early formulation development stages. Once manufactured, the LNP formulation critical quality attributes (CQAs) are quantified using established techniques, such as dynamic light scattering (DLS: size and polydispersity), electrophoretic light scattering (ELS: zeta potential) and the RiboGreen\u2122 assay (drug encapsulation efficiency and recovery) [8][9][10]. Due to significant research interest and field novelty, the characterisation of prototype LNP candidates remains on a case-by-case basis. Continuing the process to harmonise the measurement of LNP physicochemical attributes, the Nanotechnology Characterisation Laboratory (NCL) and European NCL have issued guidelines for the analysis of prototype nanoparticulate formulations [11][12][13]; they recommend the use of at least one low-resolution technique and an orthogonal high-resolution technique for the measurement of nanoparticle size, ensuring that robust and representative results are obtained while standardised reference materials are under development.\n...\nContinuing the process to harmonise the measurement of LNP physicochemical attributes, the Nanotechnology Characterisation Laboratory (NCL) and European NCL have issued guidelines for the analysis of prototype nanoparticulate formulations [11][12][13]; they recommend the use of at least one low-resolution technique and an orthogonal high-resolution technique for the measurement of nanoparticle size, ensuring that robust and representative results are obtained while standardised reference materials are under development. LNPs are composed of five main excipients: (i) the oligonucleotide active pharmaceutical ingredient [14,15], (ii) an ionisable/cationic main lipid [16][17][18], (iii) sterols [16][17][18], (iv) helper phospholipids [19,20], and (v) polyethylene glycol functionalised lipids [21][22][23]. \n\nOrthogonal analytical techniques measure equivalent CQAs via differing physical principles. While LNP research has seen significant growth, the introduction of novel analytical pipelines has not kept up with advancements in LNP formulation, presenting a translational gap. \n\nIn this study, we address this gap by reporting the use of an analytical pipeline for measuring LNP stability using a range of physical techniques spanning the low-to high-resolution analytical space [12] (figure 1). \n\nTrends in the current LNP literature demonstrate decreased adoption of high-resolution analytical techniques in the routine testing of novel LNPs, with DLS remaining as the gold-standard technique (figure 1) for the measurement of size and polydispersity. Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) has emerged as a higher-resolution particle-sizing technique in recent years, where particle size and size distributions are determined on a particle-particle basis in contrast to the bulk light scattering properties of DLS. NTA tracks the movement of particles over a set frame distance to correlate movement velocity with size, and thus size distribution. NTA can also determine the estimated concentration of particles in an LNP formulation.\n\n## Discussion\nInterest in the use of LNPs as a drug delivery platform for gene delivery has seen an exponential increase over the past decade, with the regulatory approval of three LNP-based nanomedicine products: one therapeutic, and two vaccines for use in clinical settings. Since oligonucleotides encapsulated in LNPs can consist of a range of constituents, screening of prototype formulations during early development is crucial. As the range of academic and industrial applications of LNPs has seen tremendous growth, established techniques within the nanomedicine field have translated into adopted routine techniques for characterising the physicochemical attributes of LNP formulation candidates. Trend analysis of LNP research highlights that novel high-resolution analytical pipelines have not experienced an equivalent growth in their implementation in line with advancements in lipid research and they remain under-utilised for studying prototype formulations (figure 1). \n\nThe goal of this study was to apply high-resolution analytical techniques for profiling LNP nanomedicine physicochemical properties during early prototype development to facilitate clinical translation for therapeutic applications. In this work we use DOTAP-LNPs as a model LNP system, using PolyA as a model payload. We report the evaluation of process parameter manufacture and purification steps on LNP physical parameters, and an assessment of their physicochemical stability under refrigerated and ultra-low temperature storage (\u221280 \u2022 C) conditions using increasing-resolution orthogonal techniques. These advanced techniques provide deeper insights into LNP CQAs, enabling better control over CQAs and thereby advancing their translation. \n\nAnalysis of process parameter samples demonstrated that post-dialysis exchange of manufacturing buffer to formulation storage buffer resulted in unmasking of surface charges, increasing the LNP particle size distribution through sub-population formation and decreasing PolyA recovery (table S2). Our results highlight the importance of filter membrane selection. Both the PES and PVDF membranes that were selected were hydrophilic and low-binding: thus, ideally suited to biological aqueous formulated samples. The PVDF membrane contains electronegative fluoride groups, whereas PES contains sulfone moieties.",

Crommelin\n## Abstract\nNone\n## Stage-Appropriate Analytical Characterization of mRNA Drug Products During Development\nIn this section, we focus on the analytical methods used to assess the stability of mRNA and mRNA-LNP drug products during their clinical development (leading towards eventual market approval), rather than providing an exhaustive description of all published methods for mRNA and LNP characterization. 38 The analytical toolbox for mRNA and mRNA-LNP characterization will evolve during the progression from pre-clinical development to clinical trials to regulatory approval and the purpose and requirements will be different for each stage of development. For example, pre-clinical work is focused on characterization of materials, understanding the processes, and development of the analytical methods themselves, especially for such new and complex drug products as mRNA-LNPs. During early clinical subsequent stages of development, the purpose of analysis can vary from in-depth characterization of impurities and degradation products, to monitoring the known and proposed critical quality attributes (CQAs) of batches derived from different processes during scale-up. In the late-stage development phase, this emphasis of analysis will shift to batch release, stability studies and establishment of shelf-lives. 39,40 Regulatory agencies also recognize that during different stages of development the depth of product knowledge varies, and thus different quality criteria (i.e., specifications) are appropriate for each analytical method. This is commonly referred to as 'stageappropriate characterization' in which all the accumulated experience from the development stage work should ultimately be the basis for setting the quality criteria for ultimate market approval. The dynamics of this analytical development process are exemplified in the Comirnaty Public Assessment Report where it is mentioned that during the rolling review of the data, additional characterization data and tests were requested before final approval. 41 n a recent review, a Quality-by-Design (QbD) framework for future development, design and control of manufacturing processes for mRNA and LNP products was proposed. In order to implement this approach, a thorough understanding of process parameters (Critical Process Parameters, CPPs), analytical methods, and Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs) is also required. 42 To ensure rapid regulatory convergence of the currently approved mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, they were developed under a more conventional Quality-by-Testing paradigm due to the unprecedented speed with which they were developed and the fact that these products were \"first-in-class\".\n\n## Methods for Analysis of Lipids, Lipid Impurities and Lipid-mRNA Adducts\nThe FDA has published a 'Guidance for industry for liposome drug products' in 2018 83 but a similar document that is directly applicable to RNA-LNP drug products is not yet available.

The sample preparation and chromatographic conditions were optimized to fully recover and separate the main lipids and their potential degradants. This method was validated to be linear, precise, accurate, and specific for two LNP formulations: PEG-DMG, cholesterol, Cationic Lipid 1 and DSPC, and PEG Lipid 2, Cholesterol, Cationic Lipid 2, and DSPC. This robust separation makes the method ideal for future work to support mRNA-LNP vaccines or other LNP containing drug candidate development for measuring lipid content and identity as well as monitoring the stability of LNP formulations. With optimization of the mobile phase pH other amine-containing lipids can be controlled to elute in-between cholesterol and DSPC and main reasonable run times. We think this method will be a beneficial contribution to the growing interest LNP technologies -not only in vaccines, but also therapeutics and there drug candidates utilizing this technology. \n\nWe would like to extend our gratitude to Dr Adam Socia and Dr Ping Zhuang for providing critical review to the manuscript.

                    "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been used for a variety of applications throughout the years such as therapeutics [1], delivery system [2], vaccines [3], and adjuvants [3]. Most recently, mRNA and LNP technology is being evaluated and approved by the Food and Drug Association (FDA) as a delivery vehicle for two of the leading vaccine candidates for SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic [4]. In the past, this technology was utilized for RSV vaccine candidates such as V171 (mRNA-1777) [5] and preclinical vaccine development for VZV (mRNA-1278) [6]. For any of these applications, the LNP formulation typically consists of multiple lipids. \n\nIn this paper, we consider LNPs for mRNA delivery formulated with four types of lipids: a cationic lipid with an amine functional group that interacts with mRNA via ionic interactions (Cationic Lipid 1 or Cationic Lipid 2), a PEG (Polyethylene glycol)-lipid conjugate (PEG-DMG (1,2-Dimyristoyl-rac-glycero-3-methylpolyoxyethylene) or PEG Lipid 2), cholesterol, and a zwitterionic helper phospholipid (1,2-Distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC)). Quantitation of the individual lipids is required to support process and formulation development and are key quality attributes for manufacture. Chemical stability of each lipid is also important for clinical and safety studies and quality assurance. Lipid chemical degradation could lead to LNP aggregation and degradation during storage [7,8]. Therefore, a robust, stability-indicating analytical tool was required to support clinical development and the following commercialization.",

Klein, R. Rustandi, John W Loughney\n## Abstract\nFor many years, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been used as delivery vehicles for various payloads (especially various oligonucleotides and mRNA), finding numerous applications in drug and vaccine development. LNP stability and bilayer fluidity are determined by the identities and the amounts of the various lipids employed in the formulation and LNP efficacy is determined in large part by the lipid composition which usually contains a cationic lipid, a PEG\u2010lipid conjugate, cholesterol, and a zwitterionic helper phospholipid. Analytical methods developed for LNP characterization must be able to determine not only the identity and content of each individual lipid component (i.e., the parent lipids), but also the associated impurities and degradants. In this work, we describe an efficient and sensitive reversed\u2010phase chromatographic method with charged aerosol detection (CAD) suitable for this purpose. Sample preparation diluent and mobile phase pH conditions are critical and have been optimized for the lipids of interest. This method was validated for its linearity, accuracy, precision, and specificity for lipid analysis to support process and formulation development for new drugs and vaccines.\n## Introduction\nLipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been used for a variety of applications throughout the years such as therapeutics [1], delivery system [2], vaccines [3], and adjuvants [3]. Most recently, mRNA and LNP technology is being evaluated and approved by the Food and Drug Association (FDA) as a delivery vehicle for two of the leading vaccine candidates for SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic [4]. In the past, this technology was utilized for RSV vaccine candidates such as V171 (mRNA-1777) [5] and preclinical vaccine development for VZV (mRNA-1278) [6]. For any of these applications, the LNP formulation typically consists of multiple lipids. \n\nIn this paper, we consider LNPs for mRNA delivery formulated with four types of lipids: a cationic lipid with an amine functional group that interacts with mRNA via ionic interactions (Cationic Lipid 1 or Cationic Lipid 2), a PEG (Polyethylene glycol)-lipid conjugate (PEG-DMG (1,2-Dimyristoyl-rac-glycero-3-methylpolyoxyethylene) or PEG Lipid 2), cholesterol, and a zwitterionic helper phospholipid (1,2-Distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC)). Quantitation of the individual lipids is required to support process and formulation development and are key quality attributes for manufacture. Chemical stability of each lipid is also important for clinical and safety studies and quality assurance. Lipid chemical degradation could lead to LNP aggregation and degradation during storage [7,8]. Therefore, a robust, stability-indicating analytical tool was required to support clinical development and the following commercialization.\n...\nTherefore, a robust, stability-indicating analytical tool was required to support clinical development and the following commercialization. \n\nPreviously, gas chromatography coupled with flame ionization detection (GC/FID) [9], LC/MS [10], highperformance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled with an evaporative light scattering detector (ELSD) [11,12] have been utilized for the analysis of lipids. However, GC-FID is rather laborious involving derivatization and is not able to analyze high molecular weight components. LC-MS is expensive and difficult for high sample throughput, and is better suited for investigational purposes instead of routine testing. Finally, ELSD does not provide sufficient sensitivity for impurity detection. \n\nCharged aerosol detection has become increasingly popular in the pharmaceutical industry due to its ability to detect analytes lacking chromophores that have low vapor pressure [13]. Previously at Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA, a UHPLC coupled with charged aerosol detector (CAD) method was developed and used for lipid analysis for small interfering RNA (siRNA) LNP studies [14]. The CAD's high sensitivity makes it an ideal choice over the ELSD. Charged aerosol detection has been found to be up to six times more sensitive than the ELSD making integration and identification of low-level impurities better achievable [15,16]. By utilizing reversed phase liquid chromatography coupled with a CAD, this method could even be modified for mass spectrometry for investigational impurity identification [17]. Finally, the CAD's ease of use and low maintenance is beneficial for transfer to QC labs. \n\nFor the aforementioned reasons, UHPLC combined with a CAD was chosen and evaluated to support various mRNA-LNP vaccine programs.

Though three of the lipids mentioned in this article are proprietary and cannot be disclosed, this methodology is valuable to highlight in the growing field of mRNA-LNP technology. In addition to chromatography conditions, sample preparation diluent is also discussed due to its importance for accurate lipid quantitation. This method was validated using standard analytical parameters such as linearity, specificity, range, accuracy, and precision. Finally, an example lipid stability study is reported using the UHPLC-CAD method.\n\n## Concluding remarks\nAn efficient and sensitive reverse-phase UHPLC-CAD method was developed for the analysis of lipid components of mRNA encapsulated lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) in order to support process and formulation development studies and clinical material release and stability testing. The sample preparation and chromatographic conditions were optimized to fully recover and separate the main lipids and their potential degradants. This method was validated to be linear, precise, accurate, and specific for two LNP formulations: PEG-DMG, cholesterol, Cationic Lipid 1 and DSPC, and PEG Lipid 2, Cholesterol, Cationic Lipid 2, and DSPC. This robust separation makes the method ideal for future work to support mRNA-LNP vaccines or other LNP containing drug candidate development for measuring lipid content and identity as well as monitoring the stability of LNP formulations. With optimization of the mobile phase pH other amine-containing lipids can be controlled to elute in-between cholesterol and DSPC and main reasonable run times. We think this method will be a beneficial contribution to the growing interest LNP technologies -not only in vaccines, but also therapeutics and there drug candidates utilizing this technology. \n\nWe would like to extend our gratitude to Dr Adam Socia and Dr Ping Zhuang for providing critical review to the manuscript. We also would like to extend our gratitude to our colleagues at Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA Vaccine Process Development and Vaccine Drug Product Development MRL for providing us with all of the LNP materials used for this study. \n\nThe authors have declared no conflict of interest.",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles as a delivery mechanism for mRNA-based therapies present their own challenges in terms of characterization and analysis. Fundamentally, the lipid nanoparticle is comprised of four lipids (e.g., cationic/ionizable lipids, phospholipids, pegylated lipids, and cholesterol) at a specific ratio, each of which play a role in the stability, delivery, and efficacy of the nanoparticle. While elegant in design, similarities in the physicochemical properties of the lipids, as well as their relative abundance, require consideration when developing characterization and stability indicating methods. \n\nThe first analytical consideration to make in this regard is one about sample preparation. Ideas for sample preparation can be drawn from understanding how LNPs are formed. Ganesan and Narayanasamy have comprehensively reviewed a wide array of LNP preparation approaches [90]. Most commonly, two solutions are prepared for mixing -one is an ethanol solution of lipids and the other is an aqueous solution of mRNA. The aqueous solution is ratiometrically introduced to the ethanolic lipid solution using mixing techniques ranging from pipette aspiration to microfluidics. The assembly of the LNP can be reversed for the sake of compositional analysis. A preferred approach for this involves dissolving the particle by the addition of organic solvent. An RPLC analysis with either evaporative light scattering, charged aerosol, or mass spectrometric detection can thereafter be performed. Methanol is a commonly used organic solvent for liposome disruption where it can alter bilayer membrane structures and release the encapsulated drugs. Methanol and other organic solvents have proven to be equally effective at dissolving solid lipid nanoparticles. In fact, mixtures of chloroform and methanol and solutions containing methanol or isopropanol have also been used with success [91]. Li et al. prepared individual samples for siRNA and Fig. 8.

The sample preparation and chromatographic conditions were optimized to fully recover and separate the main lipids and their potential degradants. This method was validated to be linear, precise, accurate, and specific for two LNP formulations: PEG-DMG, cholesterol, Cationic Lipid 1 and DSPC, and PEG Lipid 2, Cholesterol, Cationic Lipid 2, and DSPC. This robust separation makes the method ideal for future work to support mRNA-LNP vaccines or other LNP containing drug candidate development for measuring lipid content and identity as well as monitoring the stability of LNP formulations. With optimization of the mobile phase pH other amine-containing lipids can be controlled to elute in-between cholesterol and DSPC and main reasonable run times. We think this method will be a beneficial contribution to the growing interest LNP technologies -not only in vaccines, but also therapeutics and there drug candidates utilizing this technology. \n\nWe would like to extend our gratitude to Dr Adam Socia and Dr Ping Zhuang for providing critical review to the manuscript.

LNPs are composed of five main excipients: (i) the oligonucleotide active pharmaceutical ingredient [14,15], (ii) an ionisable/cationic main lipid [16][17][18], (iii) sterols [16][17][18], (iv) helper phospholipids [19,20], and (v) polyethylene glycol functionalised lipids [21][22][23]. \n\nOrthogonal analytical techniques measure equivalent CQAs via differing physical principles. While LNP research has seen significant growth, the introduction of novel analytical pipelines has not kept up with advancements in LNP formulation, presenting a translational gap. \n\nIn this study, we address this gap by reporting the use of an analytical pipeline for measuring LNP stability using a range of physical techniques spanning the low-to high-resolution analytical space [12] (figure 1). \n\nTrends in the current LNP literature demonstrate decreased adoption of high-resolution analytical techniques in the routine testing of novel LNPs, with DLS remaining as the gold-standard technique (figure 1) for the measurement of size and polydispersity. Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) has emerged as a higher-resolution particle-sizing technique in recent years, where particle size and size distributions are determined on a particle-particle basis in contrast to the bulk light scattering properties of DLS. NTA tracks the movement of particles over a set frame distance to correlate movement velocity with size, and thus size distribution. NTA can also determine the estimated concentration of particles in an LNP formulation.",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) as nanocarriers for the delivery of oligonucleotide-based therapeutics have sparked a profound change in the industry sector, due to their success in delivering vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic. The successful global implementation of LNPs has seen a rapid growth in research into their applications for the delivery of cargo in a range of therapy areas of unmet clinical need. Alterations in LNP constituent lipids and ratios have led to the discovery of a broad spectrum of prospective nanomedicine candidates in pharmaceutical industry pipelines, increasing the popularity of LNPs and their versatility and applicability to a diverse molecular portfolio [1][2][3][4][5]. \n\nThe successful clinical and commercial translation of LNPs for oligonucleotide delivery depends on acceptable formulation physicochemical stability of the nanocarrier during its shelf life, and the ability to protect oligonucleotide cargo from premature degradation. Highlighted by recent reviews [6,7], there is a critical need for the development of orthogonal analytical pipelines to profile prototype LNP physicochemical attributes during early formulation development stages. Once manufactured, the LNP formulation critical quality attributes (CQAs) are quantified using established techniques, such as dynamic light scattering (DLS: size and polydispersity), electrophoretic light scattering (ELS: zeta potential) and the RiboGreen\u2122 assay (drug encapsulation efficiency and recovery) [8][9][10]. Due to significant research interest and field novelty, the characterisation of prototype LNP candidates remains on a case-by-case basis. Continuing the process to harmonise the measurement of LNP physicochemical attributes, the Nanotechnology Characterisation Laboratory (NCL) and European NCL have issued guidelines for the analysis of prototype nanoparticulate formulations [11][12][13]; they recommend the use of at least one low-resolution technique and an orthogonal high-resolution technique for the measurement of nanoparticle size, ensuring that robust and representative results are obtained while standardised reference materials are under development.",

            "text": "The progress in establishing stable LNPs is still in its early phases and entails various challenges to produce commercial products that incorporate LNPs. The stability profile of LNPs can be assessed by measuring the particle size, PDI, ZP, %EE and drug release profile over different storage periods as per the ICH guidelines [94]. The experience of formulating therapeutic proteins, such as monoclonal antibodies, can be helpful in predicting potential issues that may occur during the preparation of LNPs for RNA delivery. This knowledge can assist in anticipating challenges related to the chemical stability of the LNP components, the physical stability of the LNP (such as disintegration, aggregation, and adsorption on surfaces), and the stability of RNA within the LNP, which can help us gain a better understanding of LNP preparation and enhance the delivery of RNA therapeutics. SLN stability is primarily determined by the type of lipid material used, the concentration of surfactant, and the optimization of temperature during preparation, making these parameters a critical factor to be considered to ensure proper stability and storage [95]. Synthetic nanoparticle studies conducted in aqueous solutions have revealed that several interactions between nanoparticles and co-solutes are foreseeable. These interactions are affected by the hydrophobicity of the nanoparticles, which, in turn, causes diverse behaviors in the effect of salts on the solubility of the nanoparticles [96]. The significance of lipid-based formulations in solving solubility and enhancing the bioavailability of drugs cannot be overstated. However, there is a noticeable challenge regarding lipid excipient chemistry and its performance, particularly concerning oxidative stability. Antioxidants have been utilized to preserve the stability of pharmaceutical products by either intervening chemically in crucial oxidative phases, preventing the onset of reactions, or by markedly reducing oxidative reaction rates. This maintains the integrity of the dosage form and ensures the stability of the drugs. Chelating agents have the potential to serve as an initial protective measure against oxidation initiated by metals.",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticle (LNP) is a promising delivery platform for nucleic acids, for example mRNA or siRNA, in the areas of infectious disease [1][2][3][4][5][6][7], oncology [8][9][10][11] and SARS-CoV-2 vaccine [12,13]. LNPs encapsulating RNA (LNP-RNA) are formed through electrostatic capture and rapid precipitation by mixing of the payload and lipid packets comprised of cationic and neutral lipids. Various efforts have been made to study the physicochemical characteristic of the particles, such as size [14,15] and compositional heterogeneity [14], morphology [14,16,17], macromolecular structure [18] and RNA encapsulation efficiency [17,19]. Deep understanding of LNPs at the molecular level can help elucidate correlation of structure and in vitro/ in vivo performance, and develop effective manufacturing and control strategies. \n\nResearch has shown that the in vivo potency and tissue-penetrating ability of LNPs are related to particle size [20,21]. Through fractionation by semi-preparative SEC and subsequent offline size measurement of the fractionated samples by hydrodynamic light scattering (DLS), Zhang et al. studied the size dependence of LNP composition, RNA encapsulation and in vitro gene-silencing activities [15]. Their data showed correlation between the cationic polymer/RNA ratio and RNA gene-silencing potency, which highlighted the importance of size-based compositional assessment of the LNP-RNAs. \n\nAlthough semi-preparative fractionation by size with offline fraction analysis provides a viable approach to analysis of size-based compositional heterogeneity, the experiment is lengthy and laborious, and not suitable for use as a routine analytical procedure. Online analysis of the RNA payload versus size, in a single automated run, would be highly desirable.",

            "text": "In this study, a simple and fast HPLC-DAD/ELSD method was developed for the quantitative analysis of 7 lipids involved in ionizable lipid nanoparticles. Prior to injection, a simple sample preparation step was applied, consisting in a single dilution of LNP formulations in ethanol. All validation criteria required by the guidelines ICH Q2(R1) & (R2) were fulfilled, proving the linearity, the accuracy, the repeatability, the intermediate repeatability, and the specificity of the HPLC method. Moreover, sufficient detection and quantification limits for all lipids were achieved and the method proved to be robust.\n\nDue to its high selectivity, this method also offers the opportunity to test the stability of lipid excipients through the simultaneous determination of lipids of interest as well as their degradation products. Indeed, a baseline separation of main lipid hydrolysis products i.e. lysoforms and free fatty acids, from lipidic components was achieved.\n\nFinally, the validated HPLC-DAD/ELSD method was successfully applied to the quantitative analysis of ionizable LNPs of various composition. Each lipid was individually quantified at the two main steps of the formulation process; after rapid mixing and after dialysis. A loss of lipids of about 40% was evidenced during the dialysis stage, without inducing changes in relative lipid molar ratios. This method therefore pointed out the importance of quantification of lipids after the purification step, which is often overlooked. Such method would also allow fine tuning of the process parameters to improve the formulation process and reduce the lipid loss in the final formulation.\n\nThe structural variety of analyzed lipids including new lipids never studied in the literature, such as the ionizable CSL3 and the PEG alternative PolyEtOx, proves the flexibility of the proposed method which could be easily transposed to a wide variety of lipids upon minor optimization. To conclude, the described method allows a broad range of applications in various industrial and research laboratories to optimize the formulation process of liposomes under development and for final quality controls.",

            "text": "Formulating lipid nanoparticle (LNP) mRNA products is a critical step in developing mRNA-based therapeutics, including mRNA vaccines and gene therapies. LNPs are lipidbased nanoparticles that encapsulate mRNA molecules, protect them from degradation, facilitate cellular uptake, and enable efficient mRNA delivery into cells. The formulation of LNP mRNA products involves several key components and steps. \n\nLipid selection: The choice of lipids is a crucial factor in LNP formulation. Different lipids with varying properties, such as cationic, ionizable, and PEGylated lipids, can form LNPs with distinct characteristics. For example, cationic lipids provide a positive charge to LNPs, enhancing cellular uptake, while ionizable lipids allow for the efficient release of mRNA within cells. In addition, PEGylated lipids can improve the stability and pharmacokinetics of LNPs. mRNA encapsulation: The mRNA molecule carries the genetic information to be delivered into cells and is encapsulated within LNPs. mRNA is complexed with the lipids through electrostatic interactions, forming a lipid-mRNA complex that protects the mRNA from enzymatic degradation in the extracellular environment. \n\nFormulation optimization: The formulation of LNPs is optimized to achieve desired characteristics, such as particle size, charge, and stability. Particle size is an important parameter that affects cellular uptake, biodistribution, and immune response. The surface charge of LNPs can also be controlled by adjusting the composition and ratio of lipids, which can influence their cellular uptake and intracellular trafficking. \n\nSterilization and quality control: To ensure product safety, LNPs intended for clinical use must be manufactured under sterile conditions. Sterilization methods, such as filtration or gamma irradiation, may be used to eliminate potential contaminants. In addition, quality control tests, including particle size analysis, encapsulation efficiency, and endotoxin testing, are performed to ensure the quality and consistency of LNP mRNA products. \n\nStorage and stability: LNPs are typically stored at low temperatures, such as \u221220 \u2022 C or \u221280 \u2022 C, to maintain stability and prevent degradation.",

Their biocompatibility, ability to encapsulate a wide range of therapeutic and diagnostic agents, and potential for surface modification make them ideal candidates for targeted and personalized medicine. Continued research in the development and synthesis of chemically modified LNPs to achieve tunable biodegradability in vivo would allow the optimization of delivery vehicles, making them more versatile, highly efficient, and biocompatible. Advances in nanoparticle design have significantly improved their stability, targeting efficiency, and controlled-release properties, addressing some of the major challenges in current medical treatments. It is important to note that, among the various types of lipid nanoparticles, liposomes are currently the only lipid-based carriers for theranostics that are undergoing clinical trials. This highlights their established safety profile and efficacy, setting a milestone for other lipid nanoparticles in the theranostic field. \n\nHowever, despite the promising results, several hurdles remain to be overcome before lipid nanoparticles can be widely adopted in clinical practice. These include their potential toxicity, the scalability of their production, regulatory approval, and the need for more comprehensive in vivo studies to fully understand their long-term effects and efficacy. Furthermore, combining diagnostic and therapeutic functionalities into a single nanoparticle system poses additional challenges in terms of design and functionality. \n\nFor these reasons, the use of LNPs in medicine is expected to expand significantly. The development of different types of LNPs with optimized drug delivery properties, such as nanostructured lipid carriers and ionizable cationic nanoparticles, brings additional advantages to LNP formulations and broadens the perspectives of their applications [139]. \n\nFuture research should focus on the development of more sophisticated nanoparticle systems, improving targeting accuracy, and ensuring safe and cost-effective production methods. Interdisciplinary collaboration among chemists, biologists, engineers, and medical professionals will be crucial to advance this technology from the laboratory to the clinic. \n\nIn conclusion, lipid nanoparticles hold great potential for revolutionizing the field of theranostics by pioneering more efficient and individualized treatment approaches.",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for nucleic acid delivery are mainly composed of four components ( Fig. 1): (i) an ionizable lipid, ideally ionizable with a pK a less than 7.0, which plays a critical role in nucleic acid complexation and endosomal escape; (ii) a phospholipid, that helps the formation of a stable lipid layer surrounding the nanoparticle; (iii) cholesterol, that provides membrane fluidity and biomimetic properties, and (iv) a lipid-anchored hydrophilic polymer, usually Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), that improves colloidal stability and circulation time in the blood, by preventing from undesired protein interactions [31].\n\nGiven their lipophilic character, mainly due to fatty acid chains present in their structures, the different lipids involved in LNPs are classically separated on hydrophobic C18 stationary phases [8,9,15]. The objective of this work was to develop a HPLC method to separate 7 lipids (CSL3, DODMA, Chol, DOPE, DSPC, DSPE-PEG 2000 , PolyEtOx) within a short analysis time, for their quantitative determination in various ionizable LNP formulations. PolyEtOx was synthesized from palmitic acid and hydroxyl-terminated poly(ethyloxazoline) and characterized by 1 H NMR (Fig. S1). Fig. 1 presents the chemical structures of the 7 studied lipids. Due to the absence of double bond in the fatty acid chains of DSPC and DSPE-PEG 2000 , these two compounds could only be detected by the ELSD detector. PolyEtOx, Chol, DODMA, and DOPE could be detected at a low UV wavelength of 205 nm (Fig. 2). On the contrary, aromatic chromophores of CSL3 allowed its detection in UV with a maximum absorption wavelength of 293 nm (Fig. 2).\n\nDuring method development, the type of the column and the organic solvent, the nature and the concentration of the mobile phase acidic modifier, as well as ELSD detection parameters were investigated.\n\nThree C18 columns were tested to compare selectivity and peak",

            "text": "The authors obtained a good separation profile for liposomes and three main acceptor domains (albumin, HDL, and LDL) [58]. This study confirmed that rigid liposomes and PEGylated fluid liposomes showed higher stability in human plasma when compared to non-PEGylated fluid liposomes. This means that the bilayer composition of a liposomal formulation plays a significant role in stability and drug release in biological media. Hence, separation of the plasma-liposome sample by AF4 seems to be a potential alternative to already established methods. \n\nLipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are typically spherical nanoparticles with a solid lipid core that act as a novel pharmaceutical drug delivery system [84,85]. LNPs were first approved as a drug delivery vehicle in 2018 for the drug Onpattro to treat polyneuropathy in patients with hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis [86]. It became more widely known in late 2020 because some COVID-19 vaccines, notably mRNA-1273 [87] and BNT162b [88], used PEGylated-lipid nanoparticles for mRNA delivery [89]. Similar to liposomal drug formulations, determination of payload content relative to LNP size can be important to understand the efficacy and safety. AF4 has been successfully used for the separation and characterization of lipid-based drug delivery systems; however, electrostatically interacting LNP complexes with the relatively labile lipid-monolayer coating are more prone to destabilization during the focusing step in the conventional AF4 channel [90]. \n\nNon-focusing AF4 channels (frit-inlet or dispersion channel) can circumvent the instability of the LNPs during conventional AF4 separation. In a recent study, Mildner et al., demonstrated AF4 with the frit-inlet channel was well-suited for the analysis of lipid-based nanoparticles for RNA delivery with satisfactory reproducibility and sample recovery [39].",

Prior to the approval of the mRNA vaccines, the only documented example was the registration of Onpattro \u00d2 , the first LNP-siRNA product approved. 84 The major differences between liposomal drug products and RNA-LNPs (both siRNA and mRNA) are the internal structure of the particle and the complexity of the API. As discussed before, for the mRNA-LNP products, analytical methods related to the possible interaction of the ionizable lipid and the API were requested. In addition, FDA and EMA guidelines state that for the characterization of novel excipients such as ionizable lipids or novel PEG-lipids, the level of detail provided in the submission should be comparable to that for a drug substance. 85,86 or determination of the purity and stability of lipids in the LNP, methods based on LC with CAD (charged aerosol detection) are most common, as the lipid components tend to lack a UV chromophore. Chromatographic conditions can be chosen such that the four main lipid components and their degradation products are separated. 87 he work by Kinsey et al. also includes an example of how stress testing, or a forced degradation study could be conducted for the lipid components. For detailed characterization of lipid impurities and lipid degradation products, additional analytical detection techniques based on mass spectrometry are required. 88 The identification and quantification of secondary oxidation degradation products of the lipids by LC-MS methods has been described by Abeyrathne et al. 89 For measurement of hydroperoxide levels in the lipids, methods based on iodometric titration, UV spectroscopy, chromatography, among other techniques, have been summarized. 90 ethods for the detailed characterization of the proprietary lipid components and their oxidation/degradation products are still emerging. Recently, an application note was published describing the use of electron-activated dissociation (EAD) to distinguish the oxidative impurities from ionizable lipids with great resolution and sensitivity. 73",

In this study, the type of the ionizable lipid (CSL3 vs. DODMA), phospholipid (DSPC vs. DOPE) and the hydrophilic polymer (PEG vs. PolyEtOx) was varied ( Table 2).

            "text": "Nanoparticles capable of dynamically reporting their structural integrity in real-time are a powerful tool to guide the design of drug delivery technologies. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) offer multiple important advantages for drug delivery, including stability, protection of active substances, and sustained release capabilities. However, tracking their structural integrity and dynamic behaviour in complex biological environments remains challenging. Here, we report the development of a F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-enabled LNP platform that achieves unprecedented sensitivity and precision in monitoring nanoparticle disintegration. The FRET-based LNPs were prepared using nanoprecipitation, encapsulating high levels of 3,3\u2032-dioctadecyloxacarbocyanine perchlorate (DiO) and 1,1\u2032-dioctadecyl-3,3,3\u2032,3\u2032-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI) fluorophores as the donor and acceptors, respectively. The resulting LNPs had a mean diameter of 114 \u00b1 19 nm with a distinct FRET signal. An optimal energy transfer efficiency of 0.98 and an emission quantum yield of 0.13 were achieved at 11.1% fluorophore loading in the LNPs, balancing efficient energy transfer and minimal aggregation-induced quenching. Using the FRET reporting, three dissociation stages of FRET LNPs were observed: solvation, indicated by an increased emission intensity; swelling and partial dissolution, evidenced by changes in emission maxima and mean size; and complete dissociation, confirmed by emission solely from DiO and the absence of particles. Testing the nanoparticles in live cells (telomerase-immortalised human corneal epithelial cells, hTCEpi cells) revealed a direct link to the disappearance of the FRET signal with the dissociation of FRET NPs. The nanoparticles initially exhibited a strong extracellular FRET signal, which diminished after cellular internalisation. This suggests that the LNPs disintegrate after entering the cells. These findings establish FRET-based LNPs as a robust tool for real-time nanoparticle tracking, offering insights into their integrity and release mechanisms, with potential applications in",

Regardless of the manufacturing method used for LNPs, all formulations had total recoveries greater than 75%, with individual lipid recoveries ranging between 73 and 100% (Figure 4a), and all formulations resulted in mass ratios similar to the expected mass ratio-varying with <2% error across lipids (Figure 4b). This ensures that, although some product loss is inevitable, it occurs at the same rate across all lipid components. Unequal loss, particularly of critical components such as the ionizable lipid, could significantly compromise LNP functionality. Finally, extracted mRNA from the formulations was then used to treat CFPE systems at a concentration of 2 \u00b5g/mL, and this showed similar results to in vitro testing with no significant differences in expression levels (Figure 4c).

This technique is capable of differentiating the pI of LNPs that contain one or more types of ionizable lipids, aiding in the verification of LNP identity during manufacturing processes. As a quantitative method, icIEF also provides insights into the stability of LNPs, making it applicable for both process optimization and formulation development of mRNA vaccines. Furthermore, it can distinguish between LNPs that incorporate various cationic lipids, serving as a useful tool for confirming the identity but also to study the correlation between LNP apparent pI and cationic lipids and mRNA concentrations. Four different batches of LNP containing different cationic lipid to mRNA ratios were subjected to icIEF analysis (Figure 11). The results indicate that the cationic lipid is situated on the surface of the LNP, while the mRNA is located within. This is a reasonable assumption, given that the LNP fulfils the function of a hydrophobic protective barrier, thereby protecting the mRNA. \n\nTwo distinct icIEF approaches have been developed, as reported in the literature, to evaluate the quality and stability of mRNA vaccines, particularly those encapsulated in LNPs. These methods are effective for characterising the stability of mRNA-loaded LNPs under different conditions, such as varied storage temperatures, freeze-thaw cycles, and lipid compositions, and are capable of detecting batch-to-batch variability. Overall, icIEF analysis has proven to be highly suitable for characterising mRNA vaccines. It has been an essential analytical tool during the COVID-19 pandemic and will continue to play a significant role in the development of future mRNA-based products (Krebs et al., 2022(Krebs et al., , 1971(Krebs et al., -1983)). The assessment of batch-to-batch consistency is of pivotal importance in the context of regulatory compliance. Consequently, other research groups developed robust and reproducible methodologies for the fulfilment of these tasks.",

            "text": "Therapeutic drugs and multivalent vaccines based on the delivery of mRNA via lipid nanoparticle (LNP) technologies are expected to dominate the biopharmaceutical industry landscape in the coming years. Many of these innovative therapies include several nucleic acid components (e.g., nuclease mRNA and guide RNA) posing unique analytical challenges when monitoring the quantity and quality of each individual payload substance in the formulated LNP. Current methods were optimized for single payload analysis and often lack resolving power needed to investigate nucleic acid mixtures. Ion pairing reversed phase (IP-RP) and size exclusion chromatography (SEC) are increasingly being used to characterize nucleic acids. Here, we studied their application for payload quantification in formulated LNP drug-like products. Using a detergent to disrupt the LNPs, the liberated payloads can be separated on an octadecyl RP column using a fast gradient. Reproducible results were obtained as lipids, and surfactants were efficiently eluted using a high organic solvent wash protocol. Alternatively, we also established an online SEC disruption analysis of the mRNA/LNPs wherein an alcohol and detergent containing a mobile phase was applied. Such conditions universally deformulated all tested LNP samples, indicating that a 5 min-long SEC separation can be used as a high-throughput platform method. In both approaches, the measurements facilitate a multiattribute analysis. Apart from quantitation, the characterization of specific impurities is achieved: IP-RP reveals mRNA-lipid adducts, while SEC informs on size variants, which in turn reduces a laboratory\u2019s analytical workload. These easy-to-adopt LC-based assays are expected to fortify the analytical toolbox for emerging gene therapeutics.",

            "text": "Characterization of LNPs is challenging because they are heterogeneous mixtures of large complex particles. There are limited methods for surface charge LNP characterization that have been explored including CE. To better characterize the surface charge of LNP drug delivery systems, we have developed a new icIEF method. This method uses a commercially available cIEF instrument and can measure the pI of LNPs formulated with or without mRNA. The icIEF method can reproducibly measure the apparent pI of LNPs, provided that the cationic lipid concentration is known. With detection at 280 nm, the observed signal is proportional to the LNP concentration. Surface charge of an LNP is found to be primarily driven by the cationic lipid, implying that this lipid is at the surface of the LNP. In addition, this method is capable of differentiating LNPs containing different cationic lipids and is suitable as a test for LNP identity. More importantly, it is a stability-indicating assay, which can be used to support process and formulation development for LNP-based mRNA vaccines. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported use of icIEF applied to an LNP-based drug delivery system. \n\nWe would like to thank our colleagues, specifically Dave Boyd in Vaccine Process Development for providing the LNP samples, Jessica Raffaele for generating stability samples, Katrina Fritts for dynamic light scattering technical guidance, and Alyssa Deiss for grammatical suggestions. We also would like to thank Richard Peluso for his support.

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are widely recognized as crucial carriers of mRNA in therapeutic and vaccine development. The typical lipid composition of mRNA-LNP systems includes an ionizable lipid, a helper lipid, a polyethylene glycol (PEG)-lipid, and cholesterol. Concerns arise regarding cholesterol's susceptibility to oxidation, potentially leading to undesired immunological responses and toxicity. In this study, we formulated novel LNPs by replacing cholesterol with phytochemical-derived compounds, specifically ginsenoside Rg2 and its derivative phytosterol protopanaxadiol (PPD), and validated their efficacy as mRNA delivery systems. The mRNA-LNP complexes were manually prepared through a simple mixing process. The biocompatibility of these Rg2-based LNPs (Rg2-LNP) and PPD-based LNPs (PPD-LNP) was assessed through cell viability assays, while the protective function of LNPs for mRNA was demonstrated by RNase treatment. Enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) mRNA delivery and expression in A549 and HeLa cells were analyzed using optical microscopy and flow cytometry. The expression efficiency of Rg2-LNP and PPD-LNP was compared with that of commercially available LNPs, with both novel formulations demonstrating superior transfection and EGFP expression. Furthermore, in vivo tests following intramuscular (I.M.) injection in hairless mice demonstrated efficient luciferase (Luc) mRNA delivery and effective Luc expression using Rg2-LNP and PPD-LNP compared to commercial LNPs. Results indicated that the efficiency of EGFP and Luc expression in Rg2-LNP and PPD-LNP surpassed that of the cholesterol-based LNP formulation. These findings suggest that Rg2-LNP and PPD-LNP are promising candidates for future drug and gene delivery systems.",

Most recently, mRNA and LNP technology is being evaluated and approved by the Food and Drug Association (FDA) as a delivery vehicle for two of the leading vaccine candidates for SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic [4]. In the past, this technology was utilized for RSV vaccine candidates such as V171 (mRNA-1777) [5] and preclinical vaccine development for VZV (mRNA-1278) [6]. For any of these applications, the LNP formulation typically consists of multiple lipids. \n\nIn this paper, we consider LNPs for mRNA delivery formulated with four types of lipids: a cationic lipid with an amine functional group that interacts with mRNA via ionic interactions (Cationic Lipid 1 or Cationic Lipid 2), a PEG (Polyethylene glycol)-lipid conjugate (PEG-DMG (1,2-Dimyristoyl-rac-glycero-3-methylpolyoxyethylene) or PEG Lipid 2), cholesterol, and a zwitterionic helper phospholipid (1,2-Distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC)). Quantitation of the individual lipids is required to support process and formulation development and are key quality attributes for manufacture. Chemical stability of each lipid is also important for clinical and safety studies and quality assurance. Lipid chemical degradation could lead to LNP aggregation and degradation during storage [7,8]. Therefore, a robust, stability-indicating analytical tool was required to support clinical development and the following commercialization.",

Lipid-based nanoparticles are, however, difficult to study analytically and so our understanding of the interaction between LNPs and biological systems remains obscure, particularly in terms of biomolecular corona formation and the impact this has on therapeutic efficacy and targeting. Ideally, we would like to engineer particles to acquire corona components that facilitate targeting, cargo delivery and improved safety. This requires studying the relationship between LNPs, biofluids and the resulting coronas. The particle-corona complexes are, however, fragile and biofluids also contain particles (such as lipoproteins) with sizes and biochemical characteristics similar to lipid nanoparticles, so contamination with biological components is a challenge. Here we describe a rapid, automated, and unbiased isolation method for LNP biomolecular coronas, coupled with proteomic and lipidomic analysis. Using these analytical methods, we systematically studied, in lean and obese rats, the variation in LNP-mediated mRNA delivery caused by individual physiology. A comprehensive multivariate model links LNP corona content to efficacy, identifying and validating high-density lipoproteins as a previously unidentified factor affecting particle efficacy.",

            "text": "Generally, there are two types of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) [103]. Both SLNs and NLCs have spherical shape and their average size usually ranges from 40 to 1000 nm. LNPs can be produced by several techniques such as highpressure or high-speed homogenization, supercritical fluid extraction of emulsions, solvent emulsification/evaporation, spray drying, and ultrasonication [104][105][106].\n\nLNPs are composed of a lipid solid matrix lipid and surfactants that provide stability [107]. SLN matrix is constituted by biocompatible, biodegradable, and GRAS solid lipids, which are solid at room and body temperature (e.g., highly purified triglycerides, partial glycerides, fatty acids, and steroids) [108]. The matrix of NCLs is also solid at room/body temperature; however, unlike SLNs, often it is composed of a mixture of solid and liquid lipids [101]. Figure 5 shows a scheme of these formulations, where structural differences between both LNPs are observed.\n\nIn the last years, a great attention has been paid to LNPs as an interesting and cost-effective alternative to polymeric nanoparticles, liposomes, and emulsions. LNPs are cheaper and safer than polymeric carriers, as their production is an organic solvent-free process [103]. Likewise, compared to conventional liposomes, nanoparticle solid matrix allows a higher control release and specific delivery of the loaded agent, which minimizes side effects [109]. LNPs show other benefits as compared to other systems, including ease of preparation and high scale production and sterilization [110,111], excellent physical stability, and chemical versatility. Moreover, incorporation into the nanoparticle matrix can protect molecules from light, moisture, chemical degradation, and oxidation [109] and favor their penetration through mucus barrier due to nanosize [103,[112][113][114].\n\n(i) Solid Lipid Nanoparticles (SLNs).

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a key platform for delivering mRNA vaccines and therapeutics with numerous innovative drugs under development. However, characterizing these complex and unstable products remains challenging. Developing fast, reliable methods to assess critical quality attributes (CQAs) of the mRNA component is crucial for ensuring the safety and efficacy of these medicines. Currently, evaluating key CQAs, such as mRNA integrity and encapsulation efficiency, often involves a labor-intensive manual extraction protocol, which requires LNP disruption prior to analysis. However, these additional offline steps contribute to mRNA degradation and measurement uncertainties, highlighting the urgent need for rapid and effective methods capable of performing an online LNP disruption. Hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) might offer a promising solution to address this need. Due to the presence of high concentrations of organic solvent and the possibility to work at elevated temperatures, HILIC might enable on-column disruption of LNPs while preserving the full integrity of the mRNA payload, facilitating a streamlined characterization process. To evaluate this, we developed two proof of concept HILIC methods. The first one disrupts LNPs and retains the mRNA payload using a high percentage of organic solvent and elevated temperatures. The second one, relying on milder conditions, retains only the unencapsulated mRNA, which can be used to evaluate the encapsulation efficiency. Both methods were used on Comirnaty and Spikevax vaccines and on Sanofi\u2019s in-development mRNA product as model samples. Our preliminary findings suggest that HILIC holds potential for online LNP disruption, mRNA integrity assessment, and encapsulation efficiency analysis.

The software allows researchers to simulate how lipids are organized within the nanoparticle, which is essential for determining the overall stability and functionality of LNPs. Lipid composition plays a crucial role in the efficiency of mRNA encapsulation, as well as the nanoparticle's ability to protect and deliver mRNA to target cells (Abumanhal-Masarweh et al., 2019). POLYVIEW-3D enables users to explore how variations in lipid composition-such as the inclusion of ionizable lipids, phospholipids, and cholesterol-affect the nanoparticle structure, influencing factors such as encapsulation efficiency, particle size, and surface charge. By adjusting these parameters, researchers can fine-tune the LNP design for optimal mRNA delivery (Watson et al., 2005;Arno et al., 2020). \n\nThe tool is especially valuable for examining LNP interactions with cell membranes. POLYVIEW-3D leverages the fluorescent marker Rhodamine 123 (Rho123) to visualize and analyze the activity of the P-glycoprotein membrane transporter in the MDCKII-MDR1 transgenic cell line (Sklena\u0155\u01d2va\u0301et al., 2021). This analysis is crucial for understanding how LNPs are taken up by cells, including immune cells like DCs, which play a pivotal role in the immune response to mRNA vaccines. By studying these interactions, POLYVIEW-3D aids in ensuring that mRNA-LNPs are efficiently delivered to the appropriate target cells, such as DCs, and interact with key receptors, including TLRs, to trigger the desired immune response (Porollo and Meller, 2007). \n\nPOLYVIEW-3D also facilitates the analysis of nanoparticle morphology and shape, which are key factors in the effectiveness of LNPs. Nanoparticle shape influences how LNPs interact with cell membranes during endocytosis and how they release their encapsulated mRNA into the cytoplasm (Mrazek et al., 2014).",

Since oligonucleotides encapsulated in LNPs can consist of a range of constituents, screening of prototype formulations during early development is crucial. As the range of academic and industrial applications of LNPs has seen tremendous growth, established techniques within the nanomedicine field have translated into adopted routine techniques for characterising the physicochemical attributes of LNP formulation candidates. Trend analysis of LNP research highlights that novel high-resolution analytical pipelines have not experienced an equivalent growth in their implementation in line with advancements in lipid research and they remain under-utilised for studying prototype formulations (figure 1). \n\nThe goal of this study was to apply high-resolution analytical techniques for profiling LNP nanomedicine physicochemical properties during early prototype development to facilitate clinical translation for therapeutic applications. In this work we use DOTAP-LNPs as a model LNP system, using PolyA as a model payload. We report the evaluation of process parameter manufacture and purification steps on LNP physical parameters, and an assessment of their physicochemical stability under refrigerated and ultra-low temperature storage (\u221280 \u2022 C) conditions using increasing-resolution orthogonal techniques. These advanced techniques provide deeper insights into LNP CQAs, enabling better control over CQAs and thereby advancing their translation. \n\nAnalysis of process parameter samples demonstrated that post-dialysis exchange of manufacturing buffer to formulation storage buffer resulted in unmasking of surface charges, increasing the LNP particle size distribution through sub-population formation and decreasing PolyA recovery (table S2). Our results highlight the importance of filter membrane selection. Both the PES and PVDF membranes that were selected were hydrophilic and low-binding: thus, ideally suited to biological aqueous formulated samples. The PVDF membrane contains electronegative fluoride groups, whereas PES contains sulfone moieties.",

            "text": "We have previously demonstrated that using a longer carbon tail length of 22 carbons and unsaturation in the form of 1,2dierucoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DEPE) as a helper lipid provides dramatic improvement in mRNA delivery, compared to LNPs incorporating the DOPE helper lipid. 12 hang et al. have shown the impact of formulating LNPs with different helper lipids on apolipoprotein E (ApoE) adsorption, in turn affecting the biodistribution and delivery of nucleic acids to the liver and spleen. 13 he dynamic processes of formulation and customization can engender varying degrees of \"heterogeneity\" in LNPs, which can affect their cargo loading efficiency, morphology, potency, circulation, biodistribution, efficacy, etc. This underscores the need to develop comprehensive analytical methods for a better understanding of the formulations to facilitate their consistent and reproducible manufacturing. A previous study has demonstrated the use of size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) coupled to different detection systems like ultraviolet\u2212 visible (UV\u2212vis), multiangle light scattering, and refractive index to evaluate the size distribution and polydispersity of LNP formulations. 14 However, LNP formulations can have heterogeneous subpopulations of similar sizes but different densities, which may not be separated using SEC methods. Given the complex nature of LNPs, we developed and optimized the classical density gradient ultracentrifugation (DGC) approach to separate, characterize, and evaluate the biological performance of LNP subpopulations of different densities. \n\nDGC is a key analytical technique based on first principles to characterize the density of colloidal nanoparticles, with several advantages over other methods for studying macromolecules. It is extremely sensitive and can detect minute differences in size, density, and weight, providing information about the shape and interactions of macromolecules, properties which are difficult to obtain using other techniques. Being nondestructive, the original \"parent\" and the different \"fractions\" of the formulations can also be harvested for additional investigation.",

            "text": "In recent years, messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA)\u2010lipid nanoparticle (LNP) biotherapeutics have demonstrated significant promise in disease treatment and prevention given their rapidly modifiable production processes and considerable capacity to adapt to complex or low\u2010yielding proteins of interest. As a result, many products are currently being developed in this space. Critically, well\u2010characterized and appropriately designed assays are required to monitor purity and integrity in order to maintain the efficacy and consistency of these novel products. Currently, capillary gel electrophoresis with laser\u2010induced fluorescence (CGE\u2010LIF) and ion\u2010pair reversed\u2010phase liquid chromatography (IP\u2010RPLC) are techniques of choice for mRNA integrity analysis. However, most methods proposed for biotherapeutic analysis have been developed using naked mRNA without LNP components or proprietary buffer formulations, which can obscure undiscovered impurities or complex interactions between mRNA and the sample matrix. In this study, we addressed these methodological challenges by using a biotherapeutically relevant commercial mRNA\u2010LNP sample (approx. 4200 b) to refine and optimize a customizable CGE\u2010LIF method currently under consideration for mRNA\u2010LNP biotherapeutic analysis. We systematically characterized how critical method parameters\u2014such as denaturant type, concentration, and usage\u2014and LNP disruption protocols can interfere with accurate mRNA integrity analysis in CGE\u2010LIF and IP\u2010RPLC. We found that optimal conditions for CGE\u2010LIF assay sensitivity, variability, and resolution included sample precipitation by isopropanol, high urea concentrations, no formamide as a sample diluent, and high concentrations of dye. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of both CGE\u2010LIF and IP\u2010RPLC are highlighted, and a discussion of key considerations when using or designing methods for mRNA integrity assessment is presented.",

However, GC-FID is rather laborious involving derivatization and is not able to analyze high molecular weight components. LC-MS is expensive and difficult for high sample throughput, and is better suited for investigational purposes instead of routine testing. Finally, ELSD does not provide sufficient sensitivity for impurity detection. \n\nCharged aerosol detection has become increasingly popular in the pharmaceutical industry due to its ability to detect analytes lacking chromophores that have low vapor pressure [13]. Previously at Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA, a UHPLC coupled with charged aerosol detector (CAD) method was developed and used for lipid analysis for small interfering RNA (siRNA) LNP studies [14]. The CAD's high sensitivity makes it an ideal choice over the ELSD. Charged aerosol detection has been found to be up to six times more sensitive than the ELSD making integration and identification of low-level impurities better achievable [15,16]. By utilizing reversed phase liquid chromatography coupled with a CAD, this method could even be modified for mass spectrometry for investigational impurity identification [17]. Finally, the CAD's ease of use and low maintenance is beneficial for transfer to QC labs. \n\nFor the aforementioned reasons, UHPLC combined with a CAD was chosen and evaluated to support various mRNA-LNP vaccine programs. In this article, we describe the development of a robust and efficient UHPLC-CAD method using commercially available materials and instrumentation is described for lipid analysis of mRNA loaded lipid nanoparticles used in vaccine candidates.",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a type of nanocarrier system used for the delivery of small molecules, siRNA drugs, and mRNA (Baden et al. 2021). Their prevalence and use in the drug industry greatly increased following the success of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (Hou et al. 2021). This has led to great interest in RNA-LNP delivery systems. \n\nNaked RNA is a hydrophilic, negatively charged molecule that is naturally degraded in extracellular space by RNases. Therefore, the challenge in designing a complementary LNP is one that balances these properties and protects the mRNA molecule from degradation, yet promotes delivery to cells via endocytosis (Eygeris et al. 2021). This effect is achieved by combing a mixture of lipids. An ionizable lipid or cationic lipid is one key ingredient. It balances the negative charge and independently forms an encapsulated complex with the negatively charged RNA molecule (Hajj and Whitehead 2017). LNPs also destabilizes the endosome membrane and are neutral at physiological pH to minimize toxicity (Han et al. 2021, Sun andLu 2023). Poly(ethylene glycol)anchored lipids shield the surface of the nanoparticle from charge to reduce cytotoxicity (Meng et al. 2021). Helper lipids are added to promote the fusion of nanoparticles with cell membranes (i.e. 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; DSPC). Cholesterol fills in the gap between the other lipids for vesicle stability (Kim et al. 2021). \n\nLNP success is defined by its transfection efficiency (TE), the ability of the LNP-mRNA complex to deliver the mRNA transcript to the target cell and induce the expression of the respective protein. TE is quantified by a proxy measurement of relative expression of a reporter gene such as luciferase, green fluorescent protein (GFP), or erythropoietin (Dara et al. 2019, Liu et al. 2021, Curtis et al. 2023).",

            "text": "PyMOL is a widely used molecular visualization and analysis tool that plays a critical role in designing and optimizing mRNA-LNP vaccines. This software enables researchers to create highresolution, 3D representations of molecular structures, providing deep insights into the interactions between lipids, mRNA, and cellular membranes (Rigsby and Parker, 2016). The ability to visually manipulate and analyze the structures at the atomic level makes PyMOL an invaluable tool for optimizing LNP formulations (Mooers, 2020;Mart\u0131-Centelles et al., 2024). \n\nPyMOL helps researchers build and visualize the threedimensional structures of LNPs. By displaying how lipids are arranged within the nanoparticle, PyMOL allows for detailed structural analysis, including the packing of lipids in the bilayer (Wang and Deserno, 2010). This visualization aids in understanding how changes in lipid composition impact the overall stability and encapsulation efficiency of mRNA. By adjusting parameters like lipid chain length, headgroup types, and ionizable lipids, researchers can explore how these factors influence the structural integrity of LNPs and their ability to encapsulate mRNA efficiently. \n\nPyMOL, using the molecular lipophilicity potential (MLP), a well-established method to calculate and visualize lipophilicity in molecules, allows researchers to observe interactions between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions of lipids and the charged and polar components of mRNA. By modeling these interactions, PyMOL helps identify optimal lipid compositions that improve mRNA encapsulation and stability, ensuring that the mRNA remains protected during delivery and is efficiently released once the LNP reaches its target cells (Oberhauser et al., 2014). \n\nOne of the critical steps in LNP design is the selection of the appropriate lipid mixture. PyMOL provides a platform to examine how varying lipid components-such as phospholipids, cholesterol, and ionizable lipids-affect the structural and functional properties of LNPs Seeliger and de Groot, 2010.",

The method utilizes a standard SEC-MALS-UV-dRI system and is implemented in the Nanoconjugate Analysis module of ASTRA software. The calculated RNA wt % results from four LNPs, made with different types of PEG-lipids and compositional ratios, were found to be in excellent agreement with the experimental data obtained by and fractionation with offline RPLC analysis. This work indicates that the correction of the scattering contribution to the UV signal implemented in the Nanoconjugate Analysis algorithm was adequate for reliable sizedependent RNA content analysis of lipid nanoparticles. Based on these results, we conclude that the online method is, in all likelihood, suitable for rapid and facile determination of the sized-dependent payload distribution of other LNPs encapsulating nucleic acids, or other carriers constructed from excipients that do not absorb UV at the characteristic absorption wavelength of the payload. The analytical advancement reported here provides additional characterization information, and potentially sheds light on understanding the therapeutic outcome of the RNA/DNA filled LNPs. We foresee the potential for use in quality control procedures, to evaluate the total RNA content in LNPs within a specified size range, which would constitute a critical quality attribute of a therapeutic LNP-RNA product.",

For novel excipients (e.g. cationic lipids), detailed information on the production process and quality control, including raw materials and intermediates, should be provided where possible. A detailed characterization of the LNPs should be performed, as well as a specific description of any formulation features that may affect the vaccine's quality, safety and efficacy, the impacts of which should be considered in the formulation development process [96]. The proportion of ionizable lipids in LNP lipid compositions affects the encapsulation rate of the mRNA vaccine and the nanoparticle selfassembly process; lipid species, the charge of the headgroup, and the hydrophobicity of the tail affect the particle size, morphology, and stability of the mRNA vaccine [97]. \n\nThe use of HPLC equipped with a CAD for qualitative and quantitative detection of lipid components in mRNA vaccines has been added to the second edition of the 'Analytical Procedures for mRNA Vaccine Quality -Draft Guidelines' issued by the USP [55]. Ionizable cationic lipids in mRNA vaccines have been shown to activate the innate immune response and act as vaccine adjuvants. Cholesterol may also activate the innate immune response and act as a vaccine adjuvant, so it is necessary to investigate and elucidate biological functions in mRNA vaccines and to establish quality standards with respect to these functions [98]. Some studies have reported that the presence of water in the inner core of the LNP affects the storage stability of mRNA vaccines, the amount of which is mainly related to the lipid composition and the internal structure after assembly with mRNA [91].",

A variety of stressed and lipid composition\u2010modified samples were measured and detected by their UV absorption. The results were supported by the data of an encapsulation assay and particle sizing. One method, using 9 M urea as an additive, shows two broad and jagged peaks in which the peak shape offers detailed information. The summed peak area of both peaks showed RSDs from 2% to 8% when one batch was measured in triplicate and apparently depends on the size of the LNPs. In the second method, a combination of 5.5 M urea and 2 M N\u2010ethylurea was used. This method is characterized by a high repeatability of the isoelectric point (pI, <0.5%). The repeatable peak area (RSD of 2%\u20137%) correlates linearly with the mRNA content, which also applies to the first method, and added stress is evident by the change in pI and peak area. Furthermore, experiments with the addition of a fluorescent dye were performed (fluorescence detection), which tremendously increased the sensitivity of the methods. Both methods can be used to characterize the stability of mRNA\u2010loaded LNPs, for example, when investigating various storage times at different temperatures and freeze\u2013thaw cycles, as well as the ability of the methods to distinguish lipid compositions and measure batch\u2010to\u2010batch variability.",

It also affects the delivery efficacy and biodistribution of nanoparticles. \n\nLNPs are typically produced through the microfluidic mixing method, involving the passage of RNA and lipids dissolved in an acidic organic solvent through microfluidic channels. 39 thin this environment, the negatively charged RNA interacts with ionizable lipids, which transition to a positively charged state in the low pH surroundings, facilitating the formation of small lipid droplets that coalesce into LNPs. Following production, the LNPs are typically stored under neutral or physiological conditions. \n\nMany studies have addressed the encapsulation of RNA-based drugs in LNPs, and researchers have narrowed down various lipids that are essential to formulate RNA, 40 but the exact mechanism of how these RNAs are encapsulated in the LNPs system still needs to be understood. Several LNPs developed in the last few years are either in the preclinical phase or could never reach human trials. Thus, understanding the composition and stability of various LNPs is necessary to deliver siRNA vaccines while simultaneously looking for delivery safety. An earlier study utilized coarse-grained molecular dynamics to investigate the encapsulation of small DNAs within lipid nanoparticles. 41 Recently, Trollmanm and B\u00f6ckmann 42 elucidated the lipid arrangement influenced by the protonated and deprotonated states of ionizable lipids within a lipid bilayer. Their primary focus was on understanding lipid arrangements with different protonation states, both in the presence and absence of RNA, which they observed in bilayers. Their findings in full scale LNP indicated that mRNA-free LNPs with deprotonated ionizable lipids lacked water pockets.",

            "text": "Development of an icIEF method for LNPs was initiated using broad range ampholytes to determine the apparent pI. Two different broad range ampholytes (Servalyt pH 2-9 and Pharmalyte pH 3-10) were tested and compared initially as shown in Fig. 1A (trace A and B, respectively). The Servalyt ampholytes profile showed many sharp irreproducible peaks indicating possible LNP precipitation or aggregation. The Pharmalyte mixture showed an inconsistent broad peak shape. Glycerol is known to be a stabilizing additive for protein cIEF method development [30], and was tested with the Pharmalyte mixture. The addition of 10% glycerol helped to consistently and reproducibly focus the LNP as illustrated in Fig. 1A trace C. Higher percentages (20% and 40%) of glycerol noticeably increased the viscosity and, thus, decreased the ability of the LNP to be focused in the tested separation time (data not shown). Based on the initial observation using the broad range ampholytes mixture, the estimated pI of the LNP was approximately 7.3 (Fig. 1 trace C). \n\nThe separation was further optimized by mixing different amounts of narrower range Pharmalyte ampholytes pH 5-8 into the Pharmalyte ampholytes pH 3-10. As the percentage of the narrow range ampholytes increased from 33% to 100%, the apparent pI shifted from approximately 7.6 to 7.8 (Fig. 1A trace D, E, and F, respectively). Figure 1A trace F showed the best LNP peak shape, yet the separation was more reproducible and consistent using the conditions shown in trace E. Trace E was the final ampholyte mixture used in all remaining experiments. \n\nThe ampholyte screening and optimization, shown in Fig. 1A, was performed with an LNP containing Cationic Lipid-1, which had an apparent pI of 7.7. The LNP peak was relatively broad and not quite as homogeneous as normally observed for proteins. This broad peak shape is consistent with published gel IEF methods analyzing gold nanoparticles [25].",

The wide applicability of prototype nanomedicines has the potential to fill clinical requirements for use against current untreatable diseases. The uptake and implementation of analytical technologies to evaluate these prototype nanomedicines have not experienced similar growth rates, thus hindering the translation of LNPs. Here, we evaluate a model RNA-LNP formulation with a selection of routine and high-resolution orthogonal analytical techniques across studies on the manufacturing process parameter impact and formulation stability evaluation under refrigerated and ultra-low temperatures. We analysed a model cationic RNA-complexed LNP formulation via the process impact on formulation critical quality attributes, short-term refrigerated stability evaluation and frozen-storage stability using zetasizer dynamic light scattering and nanoparticle tracking analysis. We also evaluated freeze-/thaw-induced stress on LNP formulation using high-resolution field-flow fractionation. Statistical analysis and correlations between techniques were conducted to further enhance our understanding of LNP formulation design and its physicochemical attributes to facilitate LNP formulation clinical translation.",

In addition, helper lipids such as cholesterol, DSPC, DOPC, etc., were included for structural rigidity and PEG-lipids (DSPE-PEG-COOH, DMG-PEG) for surface modification, targeting ligand attachment and stabilization. The ratio of the lipid components determines the physicochemical and functional properties and the overall stability of the resulting LNPs. In this study, the LNP-Trap formulation did not encapsulate therapeutics, so the functional lipid component was excluded from the composition. The LNP-COOH composition included two phosphatidylcholines (PC) -DOPC (46.5 molar %) and DSPC (10 molar %), cholesterol (38 molar %), DSPE-PEG-COOH (5 molar %) and lipophilic dye (0.5 molar %). These PC lipid molecules with hydrophilic phosphate heads and hydrophobic acyl tail groups may have cylindrical or conical shapes. The molecular shape determines their self-assembly and the resulting phase. The DOPC molecule is cylindrical and is known to spontaneously self-assemble to form a stable lamellar phase (bilayer structures). The phase studies of DOPC, DSPC, and cholesterol mixture have been a topic of interest concerning its abundance in cell membranes. 42 Based on the ternary phase diagram reported for DOPC/DSPC/cholesterol, the prepared LNP-COOH should have a fluidic liquid-ordered (Lo) phase. 42",

Nonetheless, challenges still exist in the successful clinical translation of these new drug formulations. \n\nFirst, the structureeactivity relationship of combinatorial LNP-based drug delivery systems needs to be further illustrated. In the studies of our laboratory and others, many effective LNPs were identified through in vitro and in vivo screening methods. Currently, there is no widely accepted design principle for LNP drug delivery systems. Even though we and others have shown that by altering the lipid chemistry and LNP formulation composition, certain properties (e.g., increase cell and tissue specificity, augmented intracellular transfection efficacy, triggered degradability, improved biocompatibility and reduced toxicity, increased membrane fluidity, and enhanced storage stability) could be introduced to the LNP system, a thorough lipid structure-activity study is needed to fully understand how the LNP systems interact with biological systems both in cell culture and in vivo 31,36,37,42,112 . It is critical to understand how the combinatorial lipids with different head, linker, and tail groups and LNPs with different size, morphology, surface chemistry, and charge properties result in differences in cell transfection efficacy, cytotoxicity, and in vivo biodistribution profiles 124e128 . A mechanistic study will eventually enable researchers to fine-tune the physicochemical and biological properties of LNPs to achieve new and better drug delivery results. This will eventually help unleash the potential of LNPs for enabling a wide range of new therapies. \n\nSecond, the storage stabilities of LNP-based drug formulations need to be carefully examined. Successful translations to clinical settings require the LNP-based drug formulations to be stable during storage and transportation 129,130 .",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have emerged as a promising delivery system, particularly for genetic therapies and vaccines. LNP formation requires a specific mixture of nucleic acid in a buffered solution and lipid components in ethanol. Ethanol acts as a lipid solvent, aiding the formation of the nanoparticle\u2019s core, but its presence can also affect LNP stability. In this study, we used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the physicochemical effect of ethanol on LNPs and gain a dynamic understanding of its impact on the overall structure and stability of LNPs. Our results demonstrate that ethanol destabilizes LNP structure over time, indicated by increased root mean square deviation (RMSD) values. Changes in the solvent-accessible surface area (SASA), electron density, and radial distribution function (RDF) also suggest that ethanol affects LNP stability. Furthermore, our H-bond profile analysis shows that ethanol penetrates the LNP earlier than water. These findings emphasize the importance of immediate ethanol removal in lipid-based systems during LNP production to ensure stability.",

Various types of nanoparticles, including polymeric, inorganic, and lipid-based nanoparticles, have been developed for drug delivery applications. 3 ipid-based nanoparticles (LNPs) constitute a subclass of nanoparticles composed primarily of lipids, which have garnered significant attention in recent years. LNPs present several advantages over alternative nanoparticle systems, including high stability, biocompatibility, and the capability to target specific cells or tissues. This targeted approach enhances drug efficacy while mitigating side effects. Moreover, the customization of LNPs through surface modification with targeting ligands further refines their specificity toward desired cells or tissues, thus optimizing drug delivery efficiency. Structurally, LNPs typically comprise a lipid bilayer surrounding an aqueous core, forming a versatile platform for drug encapsulation. This architecture facilitates the encapsulation of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs within the lipid bilayer or aqueous core, respectively, enabling the simultaneous delivery of multiple therapeutic agents. Moreover, the lipid bilayer contributes to the stability of LNPs in biological environments, shielding encapsulated drugs from degradation and extending their circulation time in the bloodstream. 3,4 LNPs can be synthesized using various techniques, such as sonication, 5 microfluidics, 6 and extrusion. 7",

            "text": "The robust characterization of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) encapsulating therapeutics or vaccines is an important and multifaceted translational problem. Sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation (SV-AUC) has proven to be a powerful approach in the characterization of size-distribution, interactions, and composition of various types of nanoparticles across a large size range, including metal nanoparticles (NPs), polymeric NPs, and also nucleic acid loaded viral capsids. Similar potential of SV-AUC can be expected for the characterization of LNPs, but is hindered by the flotation of LNPs being incompatible with common sedimentation analysis models. To address this gap, we developed a high-resolution, diffusion-deconvoluted sedimentation/flotation distribution analysis approach analogous to the most widely used sedimentation analysis model c(s). The approach takes advantage of independent measurements of the average particle size or diffusion coefficient, which can be conveniently determined, for example, by dynamic light scattering (DLS). We demonstrate the application to an experimental model of extruded liposomes as well as a commercial LNP product and discuss experimental potential and limitations of SV-AUC. The method is implemented analogously to the sedimentation models in the free, widely used SEDFIT software.",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have emerged as a cornerstone in the formulation of mRNA vaccines due to their exceptional ability to encapsulate mRNA within a lipidbased structure, providing a robust barrier against ribonucleases and facilitating their delivery into the cytosol. LNPs generally comprise four components: an ionizable lipid that dictates particle charge, cholesterol, a helper lipid, and PEGylated lipids that aid in particle stability, formation, and membrane-membrane fusion in the cell. The lipid composition of LNPs allows them to merge seamlessly with cellular membranes. This integration enables the direct translocation of mRNA into the cytoplasm, bypassing the endosomal pathway and reducing the risk of degradation within lysosomal compartments. Once inside the cell, the encapsulated mRNA is released, allowing translation of the encoded antigens and subsequent induction of a targeted immune response [185]. \n\nFurthermore, the versatility of LNPs allows for their optimization in terms of size, charge, and surface properties. Particle size is directly linked to biodistribution. Particle sizes between 200 and 400 nm tend to accumulate in the spleen after intravenous administration, whereas smaller particles, ideally between 20 and 50 nm, are necessary for effective trafficking into lymph nodes [186,187]. By adjusting these parameters or incorporating specific targeting ligands, LNPs can be tailored to enhance cellular uptake and direct delivery to specific cell types or tissues [188,189]. This targeted delivery not only improves the efficacy of the vaccine but also minimizes potential off-target effects [190], making LNPs an indispensable tool for developing advanced mRNA vaccine formulations. These strategies collectively enhance mRNA vaccine stability, delivery efficiency, and therapeutic potential, which are critical for their application in preventing infectious diseases and treating conditions such as cancer.",

Among these nanomaterials, lipid-based nanoparticles (LNPs) have shown remarkable pharmacological performance and promising therapeutic outcomes, thus gaining substantial interest in preclinical and clinical research. In this review, we introduce the main types of LNPs used in drug formulations such as liposomes, nanoemulsions, solid lipid nanoparticles, nanostructured lipid carriers, and lipid polymer hybrid nanoparticles, focusing on their main physicochemical properties and therapeutic potential. We discuss computational studies and modeling techniques to enhance the understanding of how LNPs interact with therapeutic cargo and to predict the potential effectiveness of such interactions in therapeutic applications. We also analyze the benefits and drawbacks of various LNP production techniques such as nanoprecipitation, emulsification, evaporation, thin film hydration, microfluidic-based methods, and an impingement jet mixer. Additionally, we discuss the major challenges associated with industrial development, including stability and sterilization, storage, regulatory compliance, reproducibility, and quality control. Overcoming these challenges and facilitating regulatory compliance represent the key steps toward LNP\u2019s successful commercialization and translation into clinical settings.",

            "text": "The physical properties of DMKD-PS and other LNPs (ALC-0315, SM-102, and DMKD) were analyzed before and after mRNA complexation. Particle size, zeta potential, and polydispersity indexes (PDIs) were measured using a particle analyzer (Figure 2) (Table 1). All LNP formulations were hydrated in normal saline and their final pH was adjusted to a physiological pH of 7.4. \n\nWithout mRNA complexation, SM-102 LNPs displayed a nonhomogeneous particle size distribution. The ALC-0315 and SM-102 LNPs had an average size of approximately 200 nm, whereas the DMKD and DMKD-PS LNPs measured 150 nm or less (Figure 2a). Upon mRNA complexation, a shift towards a more homogeneous size distribution was observed in all LNP types, accompanied by slight size changes (Figure 2b). In summary, the ALC-0315 and SM-102 LNPs exhibited reduced size and stabilized PDI values when mRNA was encapsulated. Although the DMKD and DMKD-PS LNPs increased in size, they remained below 200 nm. Notably, the DMKD LNPs showed a minor increase in PDI, and a decrease in zeta potential was observed for all LNPs after mRNA complexation (Table 1). The size distribution of the ALC-0315 and SM-102 lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) was found to be more stable when mRNA was encapsulated. These LNPs typically use an ionizable lipid forming a monolayer, with mRNA and the lipid creating a reverse micelle core for particle stabilization [32][33][34]. The same pattern was observed in LNPs using DMKD and DMKD-PS. Unlike ALC-0315 and SM-102, DMKD-based LNPs, which use a cationic rather than an ionizable lipid, have a bilayer liposome structure. The inclusion of negatively charged nucleic acids either inside or on the particle surface stabilizes this structure.",

Among label free techniques, Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) biosensing is a versatile tool to study LNPs in the field of nanotherapeutics research. SPR, widely used for the analysis of molecular interactions, is based on the immobilization of one of the interacting partners to the sensor surface, which can be easily achieved in the case of LNPs by hydrophobic attachment onto commercial lipid- capture sensor chips. In the last years SPR technology has emerged as an interesting strategy for studying molecular aspects of drug delivery that determines the efficacy of the nanotherapeutical such as LNPs' interactions with biological targets, with serum proteins and with tumor extracelullar matrix. Moreover, SPR has contributed to the obtention and characterization of LNPs, gathering information about the interplay between components of the formulations, their response to organic molecules and, more recently, the quantification and molecular characterization of exosomes. By the combination of available sensor platforms, assay quickness and straight forward platform adaptation for new carrier systems, SPR is becoming a high throughput technique for LNPs' characterization and analysis.",

The technique measures the diffusion of the particles, which can be converted to the hydrodynamic diameter through the StokeseEinstein equation. In terms of the detection angle, backscattering can be particularly useful for concentrated or turbid samples, as can be the case for LNPs. Jia et al. [26] proposed the use of size-exclusion chromatography in combination with multi-angle light scattering detector for characterizing LNPs based on size and RNA content. \n\nCryogenic electron microscopy, including cryogenic transmission EM (cryo-TEM), is a technique used to image frozen LNP samples, revealing their size, size distribution and shape [24,25]. The technique works by plunging aqueous LNP dispersions into liquid ethane or ethane/propane mixtures so as to avoid the formation of crystalline ice. Cryo-TEM has the advantage that the LNP samples do not need to be stained or labelled like with fluorescence-based techniques (see below). Technically, the dispersion is spread on an electron microscopy grid prior to freezing and various image analysis approaches including Bayesian and maximum likelihood estimation can be used. Kulkarni et al. [11] used the LNPs interact with serum proteins and with the cell membrane in order to cross it and deliver the NA. Several analytical and physical characterization techniques currently used to study LNP size, morphology and charge are summarized together with those used to measure NA encapsulation, transfection efficacy and their ability to bind with serum proteins and model membranes. LNP, lipid nanoparticle; NA, nucleic acid. \n\ntechnique, for example, to show that LNPs containing ionizable lipids lack a high-ordered inner structure.

            "text": "Nevertheless, all these vesicles lack of long-term storage stability and, if taken orally, they suffer a rapid degradation by stomach pH, bile salts or intestinal enzymes (Selvamuthukumar and Velmurugan, 2012). These difficulties and the need of compatible largescale manufacturing lead to the development of solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) and, more recently, nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) (Naseri et al., 2015;Oner et al., 2020). NLCs incorporate small amounts of liquid lipids in the formulation diminishing matrix crystallization, increasing drug loading and preventing drug expulsion during storage and they have proved to be cytocompatible (Rodenak-Kladniew et al., 2019;Bueloni et al., 2020) and effective for different delivery routes. \n\nThe adequate characterization of LNPs is crucial to obtain drug vehicles and to understand their behavior in biological systems. The characterization methods should focused on the LNP's parameters that determine their usefulness in nanotherapeutics: particle size and zeta potential, drug loading and drug release, stability and biomolecular interactions, among others (Mehnert and M\u00e4der, 2012). Most of the conventional methods to study biomolecular interactions require labeling, such as ELISA, fluorescence techniques or MicroScale Thermophoresis (MST) (Jerabek-Willemsen et al., 2014). Among label-free techniques, binding affinity can be assessed by Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) (Duff et al., 2011) or Biolayer Interferometry (BLI) (Weeramange et al., 2020) but, as they lack from dynamic flow conditions, kinetic parameters cannot be determined. Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) spectroscopy is a label free optical technique capable of realtime measuring through changes in the refractive index (RI) in the vicinity of a metal surface. To do so, one binding partner (ligand) is immobilized on a sensor chip while the free counterpart (analyte) from a sample solution is injected through a microfluidic setup (Figure 1A).",

            "text": "This clearly indicates that multiple nucleic acid strands can be encapsulated within a single lipid nanoparticle, with the size of the nanoparticles being determined by the (PEG)-lipid on the surface [8] (see Figure 3E,F). Interestingly, Gao et al. used computational methods to design optimized siRNA-LNP formulations and found that nanoparticles formed with an N/P ratio of 6 had a larger volume. We speculate that the smaller volume observed in Gao et al.'s study with an N/P ratio of 3 could be due to an insufficient number of lipid components, which may have been a major factor influencing nanoparticle size [42]. Additionally, J\u00fcrgens et al. evaluated the properties and efficiency of siRNA and mRNA LNPs, and their particle size data indicate that siRNA-LNPs with an N/P ratio of 3:1 had a larger diameter compared with mRNA-LNPs with an N/P ratio of 6:1 [43], which aligns with our findings. \n\nFor the core clusters of the six systems at 300 ns, their radius of gyration (Rg), volume, solvent-accessible surface area (SASA), and density were calculated (see Table 2). The radius of gyration and volume of the LNP_HAc_DNA and LNP_CA_DNA systems were 3.88/4.25 nm and 311.04/402.03 nm 3 , respectively, with densities of 703.20 g/L and 687.03 g/L. This indicates that the nanoparticles formed in the presence of citric acid are larger but more loosely packed, exhibiting a lower density and greater volume. Additionally, the density of the LNP_HAc_2DNA system was 715.76 g/L.",

Novel techniques and scalable production methods are needed to simplify the manufacturing of these targeted nanoparticles, making it feasible to produce them in large quantities for clinical use. \n\nTo enhance the biocompatibility of LNPs, investigating molecular structures that exhibit high biocompatibility is critical when designing ionizable lipids and other components. For instance, zwitterionic materials are known for their excellent compatibility with biological systems. Exploring new strategies for endosomal escape and cytosolic delivery based on organic chemistry is essential for achieving safe and efficient delivery because LNPs can be subject to lysosomal entrapment, where lipid components may degrade and compromise lysosomal membrane integrity, causing cytotoxicity. In recent years, the optimization and exploration of LNPs have involved extensive and complex screening processes, leading to the reporting of thousands of lipids. Establishing a streamlined regulatory framework for managing the vast array of LNPs and lipids plays a crucial role in handling LNP safety concerns. For example, the growing diversity of ionizable lipids, with lots of variants now available, has raised concerns about potential toxicity. Regulatory agencies must oversee these developments, ensuring that the manufacturing processes, component selection, and safety evaluation are standardized and thoroughly monitored.",

Polyethylene-glycol (PEG) is a functional lipid at the surface of LNPs that improves colloidal stability, increases circulation time, and impacts cellular uptake. In this study, we explore in-depth lipid composition at the surface of mRNA-LNPs using high-field nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Our results provide a unique surface lipid profile of intact LNPs identifying PEG chains and partial ionizable lipids are present with quantification capability. The surface PEG density is determined to reveal the brush-like conformation on the surface of mRNA-LNPs. Furthermore, we implement a diffusion NMR strategy for routine testing of formulated drug products during drug development. Comparative NMR analysis of different vaccine preparations and stability samples provides a global view of the mRNA-LNP surface structure for enhanced product knowledge.",

            "text": "The siRNA-LNPs formulation of Onpattro (Patisaran) has a shelf life of three years at 2-8 \u2022 C [26]. Research by Ball et al. using ionizable cationic lipid 306O 13 as a replacement for DLin-MC3-DMA in the formulation indicates that, under aqueous conditions, the formulation remains stable for 156 days at 2 \u2022 C and pH 7, with no significant changes in particle size or siRNA encapsulation efficiency [13]. This suggests that the stability of mRNA, rather than LNPs, determines the storage conditions and shelf life of mRNA-LNP vaccines. The method of lipid encapsulation of nucleic acids not only determines the degree of protection against nucleic acid degradation but also influences how the nucleic acids escape from endosomes following the fusion of nanoparticles with the endosomal membrane. Small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and electron microscopy (EM) experiments reveal that LNPs exhibit varying numbers of layered structures, with lipid bilayers separated by acid-rich regions [27][28][29]. The internal composition of LNPs is predominantly lipid, although some research data suggest the presence of a certain degree of water [27]. This implies that, even when mRNA is encapsulated, it may still be partially exposed to the aqueous environment. This conclusion is supported not only by previous low-temperature transmission electron microscopy results of siRNA-LNPs [30], but also by similar observations of electron-dense cores in mRNA-LNPs [4]. \n\nIn recent years, although extensive research has been conducted on mRNA-LNPs (lipid nanoparticles), two important scientific issues remain unresolved. For instance, the composition and structure of mRNA-LNPs are still a matter of debate, and the encapsulation mechanism of mRNA is not yet fully understood. Investigating the microscopic dynamics during the preparation of mRNA-LNPs can aid in the optimization of lipid nanoparticle formulations and improve mRNA delivery efficiency.",

            "text": "Lipidoid nanoparticles (LNPs), made of lipid-like compounds called \"lipidoids\", have shown great promise in delivering siRNA and mRNA into various cell types in vitro and in vivo. [1][2][3][4][5][6][7] Studies in our laboratory and others have demonstrated that these materials mediate potent gene knockdown without inducing toxicity. 1,3,5 One concern for translation of the delivery vehicles into a clinical setting is stability, which would require the identification of conditions appropriate for long-term storage of the nanoparticles. Currently, the best conditions for LNP storage, including pH, temperature, and physical state (eg, in solution, lyophilized powder), are poorly understood. In addition to aiding in translation, identifying the conditions suitable for LNP storage may also prove useful to the experimentalist who wishes to use the same batch of nanoparticles for a series of experiments.\n\nGeneric LNPs are formulated by combining lipidoids, cholesterol, distearoylsn-glycerol-3-phosphocholine (DSPC), polyethylene glycol (PEG), and siRNA. 8 Upon mixing aqueous and organic solutions under reduced pH conditions, nanoparticles form spontaneously due to hydrophobic/hydrophilic interactions as well as attractive electrostatic interactions between the positively charged amine groups on the lipidoids and the negative charge of the siRNA phosphate backbone. Although these interactions result in robust particle formation over shorter time periods, it is not known how to retain the stability of the hydrophobic and electrostatic LNP interactions during storage. Because of this, to the best of our knowledge, experimentalists from our laboratory and others must freshly prepare LNPs for each experiment. This is both inconvenient and can lead to modest yet undesirable variability in results due to the difficulty in precisely reproducing LNP formulations. Freshly preparing LNPs for each experiment is time-consuming and would not be practical in a clinical setting. Identifying a method to store LNPs for long term could save time, cost, and improve consistency from trial to trial.\n\nSimilar drug delivery systems, such as cationic liposo",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been employed for drug delivery in small molecules, siRNA, mRNA, and pDNA for both therapeutics and vaccines. Characterization of LNPs is challenging because they are heterogeneous mixtures of large complex particles. Many tools for particle size characterization, such as dynamic and static light scattering, have been applied as well as morphology analysis using electron microscopy. CE has been applied for the characterization of many different large particles such as liposomes, polymer, and viruses. However, there have been limited efforts to characterize the surface charge of LNPs and CIEF has not been explored for this type of particle. Typically, LNPs for delivery of oligonucleotides contain at least four different lipids, with at least one being an ionizable cationic lipid. Here, we describe the development of an imaged capillary isoelectric focusing method used to measure the surface charge (i.e., pI) of an LNP\u2010based mRNA vaccine. This method is capable of distinguishing the pI of LNPs manufactured with one or more different ionizable lipids for the purpose of confirming LNP identity in a manufacturing setting. Additionally, the method is quantitative and stability\u2010indicating making it suitable for both process and formulation development.",

            "text": "In the field of nanomedicine, lipid-based nanoparticles have garnered significant attention due to their distinctive properties and their potential for various applications in drug delivery [1,2]. Researchers have developed multiple types of lipid-based nanoparticles, each offering unique advantages and properties (Figure 1). Micelles, on the other hand, are self-assemblies of lipid monolayers in aqueous solutions, forming structures with a hydrophobic core [3]. The hydrophobic core of a micelle is particularly well-suited to the encapsulation of small hydrophobic molecules. They can serve as effective carriers for the delivery of hydrophobic drugs, enhancing solubility and stability. Solid lipid nanoparticles feature a surfactant shell encasing a solid lipid core matrix [4,5]. The solid matrix of solid lipid nanoparticles imparts stability and enables the controlled release properties, making them valuable in various drug delivery applications. Another notable lipid-based nanoparticle variant is liposomes, which consist of one or more lipid bilayers encompassing an aqueous core [6,7]. Liposomes can be categorized based on their lamellarity and size. Due to their unique structure, liposomes have the capacity to encapsulate both hydrophobic and hydrophilic small molecules, positioning them as versatile carriers for a wide array of therapeutic agents. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) represent a versatile class of lipid-based nanoparticles characterized by a lipid shell enveloping an inner core composed of reverse micelles [8][9][10]. This structure enables LNPs to effectively encapsulate and deliver diverse oligonucleotides, including siRNA, mRNA, and plasmid DNA. LNPs are renowned for their excellent stability and efficient intracellular delivery, making them highly suitable for nucleic-acid-based therapy. \n\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 13 composed of reverse micelles [8][9][10].",

The lipid content was analyzed just after the mixing step (before dialysis) and after dialysis (Fig. 4). Before dialysis, good recoveries (percentages of each lipid compared to initial quantities) were calculated for all lipids (between 94.0% and 110.3%), proving the disruption of LNPs by the   (Fig. 4). The dialysis of LNPs led to a loss between 32% and 55% in the total lipid concentration (Fig. 4), without inducing significant changes in lipid molar ratios (Table 2). This loss of lipids was probably due to elimination of lipids not involved into lipid nanoparticles that could pass through dialysis membrane. DSPC and DSPE-PEG 2000 were faced with the lowest recoveries (42-45% and 49-66%, respectively), probably because of their higher water solubility. Table 2 shows quantitative analysis performed by the validated HPLC-ELSD method for the 4 studied ionizable LNPs of various lipid compositions. The calculated lipid molar ratios were in good agreement with the targeted lipid molar ratios for all LNPs, proving a similar loss of all lipids during dialysis. Interestingly, this loss of lipid has not been reported for LNP-based formulations, probably because the quantification of lipids after purification is often overlooked. This study highlights the ability of the developed and validated HPLC-ELSD method to quantify lipids in LNPs with accuracy, which is essential for quality control of developed LNP formulations (lipid composition, positive/negative charge ratio, loading ratios).",

We showed that by increasing the hydrophilicity of bioreducible lipid head groups, the stability of LNP formulations loaded with the hydrophobic drug AmB was greatly improved 112 . However, the long-term stability, as well as the stability under different storage conditions (e.g., temperature, pH, ion strength and lyophilization) of quaternized AmB/ LNPs needs further investigation. Moreover, the stability of LNPmediated nucleic acid and protein delivery systems should also be investigated. For this purpose, the characterization of the changes in chemical structure of carrier lipid materials and cargo molecules as well as the supramolecular structure of cargo-loaded LNP systems will help us understand the physical and/or chemical alterations that occur during storage. This knowledge will eventually contribute to fabricating new LNP drug formulations with improved stability that can be applicable in clinical settings. It will greatly benefit the development of mRNA vaccines and other gene therapies as stable LNP formulations will help decrease the economic and logistic burdens of our society when public health crises are dealt with. \n\nThird, a better understanding of the in vivo toxicity and biodegradation of combinatorial LNPs needs to be acquired. In our studies, we showed that the systemic administration of certain types of bioreducible LNPs (e.g., R-O16B and R-OCholB) did not induce significant hepatotoxicity or nephrotoxicity under the tested conditions (through standard biochemical analysis) 36,38,42 . Our future studies will employ both biochemical tests and histological analyses to examine damages/changes induced by combinatorial LNPs in multiple organs and tissues after systemic and local administrations. Furthermore, it is currently unknown whether our synthetic combinatorial LNPs can trigger an innate or adaptive immune response. Potential interactions between the immune system and drug delivery systems may positively or negatively impact the therapeutic effects depending on the biomedical applications of the LNP systems 101,131e133 . The immunogenicity of combinatorial LNPs has been overlooked in previous studies and deserves thorough investigation.",

The final composition of DLin-MC3-DMA LNPs is DLin-MC3-DMA, DSPC, cholesterol, and 3-N-[(\u03c9-methoxypoly(ethylene glycol)2000) carbamoyl]-1,2-dimyristyloxy-propylamine (DMG-mPEG2000) at a molar ratio of 50:10:38.5:1.5. These helper lipids (DSPC, cholesterol, and DMG-mPEG2000) generally contribute to the stability of lipidbased nanoparticles [27]. In the case of hepatic delivery, it is considered that DMG-mPEG2000 is gradually removed from the LNPs in the blood at the same time as apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gradually coats the surface of LNPs, which coating triggers the transport of LNPs into hepatocytes via low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-mediated endocytosis [28].\n\nThe preparation methods of lipid-based nanoparticles for nucleic acid delivery have been significantly advanced [29,30]. One of the methods for LNP preparation involves microfluidic mixing of a lipid mixture in ethanol and siRNA in citrate buffer (pH 4.0) followed by dialysis in phosphate buffer to remove the ethanol [31]. The microfluidic mixing method enables the control of particle size and affords high siRNA encapsulation efficiency (~100%) and mass production. The structure of LNPs prepared by the microfluidic mixing method has been determined by molecular modeling [32].

            "text": "Encapsulation of mRNA into LNPs was performed as described elsewhere [44]. In brief, a 0.2 mg/mL aqueous solution (10 mM citrate buffer pH 3.0) of mRNA was mixed with an alcoholic solution of a lipid mixture in a microfluidic cartridge on a NanoAssemblr\u2122 Benchtop instrument (Precision Nanosystems, Vancouver, BC, Canada). The components of the lipid mixture were ionizable lipidoid ALC-0315 (BroadPharm; San Diego, CA, USA), distearoylphosphatidylcholine (Avanti Polar Lipids; Alabaster, AL, USA), cholesterol (Sigma-Aldrich; St. Louis, MO, USA), and DMG-PEG-2000 (BroadPharm; San Diego, CA, USA) at a molar ratio (%) of 46.3:9.4:42.7:1.6. The weight proportion of mRNA in LNPs was 0.04%wt. To form particles, we mixed aqueous and alcoholic phases at 3:1 by volume; the overall mixing rate was 10 mL/min. \n\nAfter that, under sterile conditions, the particles were passed through a filter based on a 0.22 \u00b5m PES membrane (Merck, Rahway, NJ, USA) and were stored at 4 \u2022 C. Next, the quality of the resulting particles was examined with the help of five parameters: particle size, polydispersity index, zeta potential (Zetasizer Nano ZSP, Malvern Panalitycal, Westborough, MA, USA), mRNA loading, and RNA integrity. \n\nParticle size proved to be 80 to 90 nm, and the polydispersity index was less than 0.15. Zeta potential was in the range \u22120.22 to \u22120.37 mV. Concentration of the mRNA loaded into LNPs was determined via the difference in fluorescent signals after staining with the RiboGreen reagent (Thermo Fischer Scientific; Waltham, MA, USA) before and after disruption of the LNPs.",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles without a hydrophobic core inside (LNPs) were formed from cationic and structural lipids in equal proportions and together comprised 92% of the composition. The main cationic lipid was DOTAP mesylate. Oleoylcholine (Ol-Ch) was also used as the sole cationic lipid or mixed with DOTAP. As structural lipids, a mixture of 30-31% of cholesterol (Ch) and 16% of phospholipid (DOPE, DOPC, or their mixture in a ratio of 1:1) was used (Table 1). During the formation of LNPs with a hydrophobic core (cLNPs), the amount of cationic lipids was proportionally reduced to compensate for the increase in lipid mass due to core components (14% and 7%). The hydrophobic core of corecontaining lipid nanoparticles (cLNPs) consisted of equal parts of coconut oil triglycerides (COTs) and squalene (Sq) (similar to [33]) or cholesterol acetate (ChA), which mimics the cholesterol esters that are usually included in lipoprotein cores along with triacylglycerols. The surfactants of 5% stearoyl monosorbitan (SPAN60) and 3% polysorbate 80 (PS80) were used as additional LNP components in both variants, which provided additional stability to the nanoparticles in the solution. In addition, a functional lipid-the GM3 ganglioside (GM3)-was used in the LNPs (Table 1 and Figure 1).",

            "text": "Lipid materials, owing to their lipophilic properties, facilitate efficient delivery within the body. Unlike conventional liposomes, which are spherical structures composed of a phospholipid bilayer with hydrophilic interiors housing nucleic acids [38], current lipid nanocarriers exhibit a more focused approach. Liposomes and lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) share similarities in their design, but they differ in their composition and function. Both are lipid-based nanoformulations and are excellent drug delivery vehicles, transporting their cargo within a protective, outer layer of lipids. However, LNPs can take on various forms. LNPs are similar to liposomes, but they are specifically designed to encapsulate a wide range of nucleic acids (RNA and DNA). As a result, LNPs have become the most popular non-viral gene delivery system. Companies such as Exelead develop and manufacture LNPs to encapsulate different types of genetic payloads, including siRNA, mRNA, and saRNA. Traditional liposomes typically have one or more rings of a lipid bilayer surrounding an aqueous pocket, but not all LNPs have a continuous bilayer structure that would qualify them as lipid vesicles or liposomes. Some LNPs assume a micellar structure, encapsulating drug molecules in a non-aqueous core. An additional lipid aids in accelerating the structural transformation of LNPs within cells, facilitating drug release. Meanwhile, the outer layer is often coated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) lipids to reinforce colloidal stability and prevent protein absorption or aggregation in circulation, thus mitigating immune clearance [30]. In addition, delivery systems for RNA delivery via anionic or zwitterionic liposomes have also emerged. Studies by Siddhesh D Patil et al. have shown that the transfection efficiency of some anionic liposomes is similar to that of cationic liposomes, while their toxicity is significantly lower [39]. The preparation process of LNPs can be more conveniently adjusted in size to adapt to more functions under novel methods such as microfluidic (Figure 2A).",

The APE lipid nanoparticles (APE-LNPs) were formulated by microfluidics, mixing ethanol and aqueous phases at a 1:3 volumetric ratio using syringe pumps (Pump 33 DDS, Harvard Apparatus), as previously described. 43 The ethanol phase was prepared by solubilizing a mixture of ionizable APE, DOPE, cholesterol, and C14-PEG 2000 at a molar ratio of 50:25:23.5:1.5 and A 9:1 nitrogen-to-phosphate (N/P) ratio. The aqueous phase contained mRNA suspended in 10 mM citrate buffer at pH 3.2. The APE-LNPs formulated with DOPC and DSPC were prepared by substituting DOPE. The APE-LNPs labeled with DiR were formulated as described above, with an ethanol phase composed of APE, DOPE, cholesterol, DiR, and C14-PEG 2000 at a molar ratio of 50:25:22.5:1:1.5, and the same aqueous phase composition. The concentration of mRNA encapsulated into APE nanoparticles was determined by the Quant-iT RiboGreen assay (ThermoFisher), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The efficacy of mRNA encapsulation into APE-LNPs was calculated by comparing measurements in the absence and presence of 1% (v/v) Triton X-100. Nanoparticle size, polydispersity (PDI), and \u03b6-potential (ZP) were analyzed by dynamic light scattering (DLS) using a Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments, Worcestershire, UK). APE-LNP hydrodynamic diameters are reported as the average Z-average of at least two independent measurements. The stability of the APE-LNPs was evaluated by measuring the size of the particles stored at 4 \u00b0C at days 0, 7, 14, and 28 using DLS, as described above.",

Researchers can explore different lipid types, such as phospholipids, ionizable lipids, and cholesterol, to determine the optimal combination for creating stable and effective nanoparticles.

NANOdesign also controls particle size, which is crucial for effective cellular uptake. It simulates how different formulation parameters impact the size and uniformity of the nanoparticles, ensuring they fall within the ideal range for delivery. Additionally, NANOdesign allows for modifications to surface properties, such as charge and hydrophilicity, which can alter cell membrane permeability. These adjustments can enhance the vaccine's efficacy and improve its overall stability (Salatin et al., 2015). The tool models the release kinetics, encapsulation efficiency, and stability of mRNA within the LNPs, allowing researchers to optimize the release profile for controlled delivery.

Liposomes, meanwhile, generally exhibit low encapsulation efficiency of oligonucleotides [108] , making them impractical for development towards in vivo transport and delivery of nucleic acid vaccines.\n\nLipid nanoparticles (LNPs), in their modern definition, are nanosized (i.e. < 1 \u03bcm) lipid systems made of two or more (generally four) lipids at varying ratios, and are differentiated from liposomes by lacking a hollow core: rather, they consist of a discontinuous mix of the different lipid components, and, depending on their formulation and cargo, may form a nanostructured core, a homogeneous core shell, multilamellar vesicular structures, or other selfassembled morphologies [109][110][111].

Within the microfluidic channels, the SHM allows the aqueous phase (containing the nucleic acids, e.g. mRNA, under an acidic pH) and the water-miscible organic phase (containing the lipids and cholesterol) to proceed from laminar flow (pre-SHM) through several cycles of chaotic mixing until complete mixing of the phases has occurred (cycle 15). This process facilitates the complexation of cationic/ionizable lipids (dark pink) with the nucleic acids and the formation of micelles and early particle structures formed by the lipid mix, typically consisting of a cationic/ionizable lipid, a helper lipid (orange), cholesterol (brown), and a PEG-lipid (light pink), and eventually mRNA-encapsulated lipid nanoparticles.\n\nsion electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) is shown in Fig. 2 .

            "text": "Based on comparative MD simulations of six systems (LNP, LNP_HAc, LNP_HAc_DNA, LNP_HAc_2DNA, LNP_CA_DNA, and LNP_CA_2DNA), the structural characteristics of mRNA-LNPs have been detailed, shedding light on the potential mechanisms for mRNA encapsulation in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) used in mRNA vaccines. This study specifically analyzes the effects of different N/P ratios and types of acidic environments on the formation of mRNA nanoparticles. The findings indicate that, under neutral conditions, lipid components self-assemble into nanoparticles, with ionizable lipids predominantly residing in the core of the lipid nanoparticles. When mixed with nucleic acids in an acidic environment, ionizable lipids undergo protonation, causing a redistribution of lipids that leads to the disintegration of the nanoparticles. The electrostatic interactions drive the encapsulation of mRNA, while protonated nitrogen atoms in ionizable lipids form stable hydrogen bonds with mRNA, ensuring the structural stability of the mRNA-LNP complexes. Radial distribution analysis of the mRNA-LNP components reveals that the distribution of the four lipid components within the nanoparticles follows a sequence from the outer layer to the core, as follows: DMG-PEG 2000, DSPC, cholesterol, and SM-102 (protonated). Additionally, mRNA-LNP clusters formed at lower N/P ratios exhibit larger volumes, higher densities, and greater uniformity. The type of acidic environment also affects the formation of mRNA-LNP clusters; citric acid environments are more favorable for forming larger, more uniform clusters with a looser internal structure compared to acetic acid. \n\nIn summary, the simulation results provide valuable insights for the design and optimization of mRNA-LNPs formulations and for enhancing vaccine efficacy.",

The most hydrophilic lipid, the PEG lipid, would be the last component to be deposited on the nascent LNP thus providing an outer shell for the stabilized particle (Figure 4.9). The results are also consistent with the PEG lipid, as the last component to be deposited on the nascent LNP, providing the outer shell of the stabilized particle (Figure 4.8). Based on this model, one would expect the size of the resulting LNP to be dictated by the ratio of \"core\" lipid to \"surface\" lipid in the lipid mix. Indeed, the size of the particle is freely adjustable between 20 and 100 nm in diameter simply by altering the PEG-lipid content of the formulation (Belliveau et al., 2012). In comparison with the PFV technique, microfluidic mixing results in higher encapsulation efficiency (>90%), generates smaller particles, and permits small scale production with little loss due to dead volume. This method allows for well-defined and reproducible mixing between the solutions of lipids and siRNA, resulting in lower batch-to-batch variation (Belliveau et al., 2012). The above-mentioned examples of formulation rely on ionizable cationic lipids to condense the siRNA for encapsulation into LNP. Alternatively, a lipid-coated calcium phosphate (LCP) nanoparticle that utilizes calcium phosphate to condense siRNA before encapsulation by a lipid layer was developed (Li, Chen, Tseng, Mozumdar, & Huang, 2010). The fabrication process involves combining calcium chloride, sodium phosphate, and siRNA in a cyclohexane/Triton-X-100/hexanol solution to form a reversed-phase, water-in-oil micro-emulsion (Figure 4.10). Aqueous sodium citrate is then added to the emulsion to form calcium phosphate precipitates with the entrapped siRNA.",

            "text": "Preservation of the integrity of macromolecular higher-order structure is a tenet central to achieving biologic drug and vaccine product stability toward manufacturing, distribution, storage, handling, and administration. Given that mRNA lipid nanoparticles (mRNA-LNPs) are held together by an intricate ensemble of weak forces, there are some intriguing parallels to biologic drugs, at least at first glance. However, mRNA vaccines are not without unique formulation and stabilization challenges derived from the instability of unmodified mRNA and its limited history as a drug or vaccine. Since certain learning gained from biologic drug development may be applicable for the improvement of mRNA vaccines, we present a perspective on parallels and contrasts between the emerging role of higher-order structure pertaining to mRNA-LNPs compared to pharmaceutical proteins. In a recent publication, the location of mRNA encapsulated within lipid nanoparticles was identified, revealing new insights into the LNP structure, nanoheterogeneity, and microenvironment of the encapsulated mRNA molecules [Brader et al. Biophys. J.2021, 120, 276633773963]. We extend those findings by considering the effect of encapsulation on mRNA thermal unfolding with the observation that encapsulation in LNPs increases mRNA unfolding temperatures.",

            "text": "Due to the low solubility of the polymers with a high degree of functionalization in the solvent used, the respective GPC traces were only used for the purpose of proving the absence of free dye (Figure S17). The degree of functionalization was determined via UV/vis-measurements (Figures 6, S18 and Table S3). Additionally, cholesterol was partially replaced with a cyanine 3 (cy3) labeled cholesterol derivative to track particle integrity during biological experiments. The ideal amount of cy3-labeled cholesterol was determined to be 30%, as lower amounts of cy3 present in the samples were not detectable due to fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) interactions between cy3 and cy5 in the densely packed lipid core. 84 unctionalization of the polymeric stabilizer with a fluorescent dye further allowed to verify the analytical results on the particle size populations in the LNP samples and aqueous polymer solutions obtained from DLS measurements via fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). DLS measurements showed that the LNP samples exhibit a larger hydrodynamic radius than the samples containing the pristine polymer, as the LNPs are larger than the micelles formed from the polymers without encapsulation of the lipid, or the free polymer. Nevertheless, it cannot be excluded that LNP samples contain polymeric micelles as a second species. Exemplary FCS measurements were carried out for polymer P2\u22122, and LNPs stabilized with this polymer. The obtained correlation functions were fitted as one-component diffusion with a triplet relaxation of the cy5 dye. The fit yielded diffusion coefficients and corresponding hydrodynamic radii that confirm the DLS results (D T,LNP = 24.2 \u03bcm 2 s \u22121 ; R H,LNP = 10.1 nm; D T,polymer = 73.7 \u03bcm 2 s \u22121 ; R H,polymer = 3.3 nm).",

In particular, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are known to have a high drug encapsulation efficiency, high stability and are generally inexpensive to produce [1]. Additionally, as these lipid systems can be prepared without organic solvents and are made up of lipids similar to those found in the human body, hence they are considered to be biocompatible, biodegradable and non-toxic [1,2]. Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) are two main types of LNPs [1]. \n\nBoth lipid systems are prepared using pure lipids or a blend of lipidic compounds (e.g., triacylglycerols, fatty acids and oils), and a single surfactant (or combined with a co-surfactant) surrounding the particles. The formulation technique and lipid structure typically define several LNP characteristics, including the particle size and size distribution, the drug loading capacity and the encapsulation efficiency [3]. The solid lipid composition (Figure 1) of SLNs results in their perfect crystalline core, which often results in less space available for drug loading. On the other hand, NLCs are made up of both liquid and solid lipids resulting in a more amorphous matrix and less dense lipid packaging. This allows NLCs to have a higher drug encapsulation, minimal drug leakage and long-term storage stability in comparison to SLNs [4][5][6]. \n\nSci.

            "text": "The advent of ionizable lipids made it possible to develop pharmacologically useful lipid formulations 11 . Specifically, pH-titratable lipids are almost entirely uncharged at the physiological pH of blood but positively charged at the acidic pH of endosomes. These features enable these lipid carriers to interact with negatively charged RNAs and endosomal membranes but prevent disadvantageous rapid clearance and low tolerability. Cationic or ionizable lipids with poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG)-lipids and helper lipids constitute the main components of lipid nanovehicles used for RNA delivery. PEG-lipids contribute to drug formulation stability during the production process and can shield the surface of lipid nanovehicles from blood components to optimize their pharmacokinetics and biodistribution. Helper lipids mainly facilitate lipid nanovehicles to escape from endosomes. \n\nWith the development of preparation technology, lipid nanovehicles have been developed from conventional lipoplexes to stabilized nucleic acid-lipid particles (SNALPs), lipopolyplexes, membrane/core nanoparticles (MCNPs), and lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). Therefore, in this review, lipid nanovehicles specifically include lipoplexes, SNALPs, lipopolyplexes, MCNPs, and LNPs. In contrast to classical hollow liposomes, lipopolyplexes, MCNPs, and LNPs contain a solid internal core that encapsulates RNA molecules, and therefore, they show higher kinetic stability and more rigid morphology. In particular, homogeneous LNPs are obtained by large-scale commercial fabrication methods such as T-mixing or microfluidic-mixing technology. Accordingly, LNPs are the most advanced lipid nanovehicles to deliver RNAs developed to date 12 .",

In this report, supramolecular chemistry concepts are incorporated into the rational design of a new ionizable lipid, C3-K2-E14, for systemic administration. This lipid incorporates a cone-shaped structure intended to facilitate cell bilayer disruption, and three tertiary amines to improve RNA binding. Additionally, hydroxyl and amide motifs are incorporated to further enhance RNA binding and improve LNP stability. Optimization of messenger RNA (mRNA) and small interfering RNA (siRNA) formulation conditions and lipid ratios produce LNPs with favorable diameter (<150\u00a0nm), polydispersity index (<0.15), and RNA encapsulation efficiency (>90%), all of which are preserved after 2\u00a0months at 4 or 37\u00a0\u00b0C storage in ready-to-use liquid form. The lipid and formulated LNPs are well-tolerated in animals and show no deleterious material-induced effects. Furthermore, 1\u00a0week after intravenous LNP administration, fluorescent signal from tagged RNA payloads are not detected. To demonstrate the long-term treatment potential for chronic diseases, repeated dosing of C3-K2-E14 LNPs containing siRNA that silences the colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) gene can modulate leukocyte populations in vivo, further highlighting utility.",

This structure enables LNPs to effectively encapsulate and deliver diverse oligonucleotides, including siRNA, mRNA, and plasmid DNA. \n\nLNPs are renowned for their excellent stability and efficient intracellular delivery, making them highly suitable for nucleic-acid-based therapy. Lipid-based nanoparticles offer a diverse range of options for drug delivery. Each type exhibits unique properties that can be tailored to meet the specific requirements of the therapeutic cargo. Factors such as the nature of the cargo, desired release kinetics, and the targeted delivery site play crucial roles in selecting the appropriate lipid-based nanoparticles. Ongoing research and development in this field hold immense promise for advancing drug delivery strategies and improving therapeutic outcomes. \n\nRecently, LNPs have been actively investigated for the delivery of RNA-based biopharmaceuticals [11,12]. Although non-viral vectors such as LNP have lower efficiency than viral vectors, the former are biosafe and have the advantage of being able to carry large mRNA sequences [13,14]. Furthermore, LNPs can easily fulfill three requirements for nucleic acid delivery vehicles: efficient encapsulation to resist degradation by nucleases, a mechanism for targeted delivery and intracellular entry, and a manufacturing process that allows for the mass production of uniformly sized nanoparticles [15]. The cargo content and physicochemical properties (particle size, shape, surface charge, etc.) of LNPs can be controlled by adjusting the lipid composition [16]. \n\nNanoparticles containing cationic lipids have been widely studied as carriers of genes and nucleic acids because of their ability to carry negatively charged nucleic acids and attach to the lipid bilayer of cells [17]. However, cytotoxicity due to cationic lipids and rapid elimination from the body are limitations [18]. To compensate for this, ionizable lipids that are neutral in circulation and positively charged only in endosomes have been developed and actively studied [19].",

By visualizing the changes in nanoparticle morphology and surface charge as lipid composition is modified, researchers can determine the best formulation for maximizing mRNA encapsulation, delivery efficiency, and stability under physiological conditions. PyMOL helps fine-tune these compositions, optimizing the LNP's ability to deliver mRNA effectively while maintaining stability during storage and transport (El Khoury et al., 2023). In addition to lipid composition, the surface properties of LNPs, including charge, hydrophobicity, and hydrophilicity, play a crucial role in their interaction with cellular membranes. PyMOL allows researchers to model how altering these properties impacts the nanoparticle's ability to be taken up by cells. PyMOL helps in understanding how LNPs interact with cellular membranes during the process of endocytosis. By simulating the insertion of LNPs into the lipid bilayer of a cell membrane, PyMOL enables researchers to visualize how LNPs may fuse with the membrane and release mRNA into the cytoplasm. This insight is vital for designing LNPs that optimize cellular uptake and ensure the efficient delivery of mRNA into cells for translation (Yong, 2015). PyMOL allows researchers to visualize the impact of particle size and morphology on the functionality of LNPs. Particle size is critical for effective cellular uptake, and by using PyMOL, researchers can simulate how varying nanoparticle sizes and shapes affect the overall performance of mRNA delivery. The tool helps visualize how the size and shape of the LNPs influence their stability, encapsulation efficiency, and release kinetics, which are essential factors for improving vaccine efficacy (Cao et al., 2020;Sebastiani et al., 2021). \n\nPyMOL can also be used to simulate the effects of various environmental conditions such as pH, temperature, and ionic strength on the stability and function of LNPs.",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) and their versatile nucleic acid payloads bear great potential as delivery systems. Despite their complex lipid composition, their quality is primarily judged by particle characteristics and nucleic acid encapsulation. In this study, we present a holistic reversed-phase (RP)-charged aerosol detection (CAD)-based method developed for commonly used LNP formulations, allowing for intensified LNP and process characterization. We used an experimental approach for power function value (PFV) optimization termed exploratory calibration, providing a single PFV (1.3) in an appropriate linearity range for all six lipids. Followed by the procedure of method calibration and validation, linearity (10\u2013400 ng, R2 > 0.996), precision, accuracy, and robustness were effectively proven. To complement the commonly determined LNP attributes and to evaluate the process performance across LNP processing, the developed RP-CAD method was applied in a process parameter study varying the total flow rate (TFR) during microfluidic mixing. The RP-CAD method revealed a constant lipid molar ratio across processing but identified deviations in the theoretical lipid content and general lipid loss, which were both, however, entirely TFR-independent. The deviations in lipid content could be successfully traced back to the lipid stock solution preparation. In contrast, the observed lipid loss was attributable to the small-scale dialysis following microfluidic mixing. Overall, this study establishes a foundation for employing RP-CAD for lipid quantification throughout LNP processing, and it highlights the potential to extend its applicability to other LNPs, process parameter studies, or processes such as cross-flow filtration.",

LNPs are typically formulated using four components: (i) an ionizable or cationic lipid, (ii) a PEG-lipid, (iii) a cholesterol, and (iv) a helper lipid. Thus, to isolate the effect of the Pi-Lipids, we formulated the LNPs with components that were previously shown to form stable LNPs with other (i) ionizable or cationic lipids. Specifically, we chose (ii) two PEG-lipids with different lengths of carbon chains (C 14 PEG 2K and C 18 PEG 2K ), (iii) two cholesterol variants (cholesterol, 20\u03b1-OH cholesterol), and (iv) 1,2-dioleoyl-snglycerol-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) (Fig. 1b, c). Since LNP formation and stability can vary with the ratio of these four components, we added a control to ensure our results were robust, testing four different molar ratios (Fig. 1d). Thus, using microfluidics 42 , we formulated 128 chemically distinct Pi-LNPs. \n\nWe analyzed Pi-LNPs using a FIND 32 , a DNA barcode-based assay that quantifies how dozens of different LNPs deliver mRNA in vivo [43][44][45] . We formulated LNP 1, with chemical composition 1, to carry Cre mRNA and DNA barcode 1, and LNP N, with chemical composition N, to carry Cre mRNA and DNA barcode N. By incorporating a distinct DNA barcode in each LNP, we were able to identify individual LNP delivery through deep sequencing. We performed a quality control step, quantifying the hydrodynamic diameter and polydispersity of all 128 Pi-LNPs individually using dynamic light scattering. Only monodisperse Pi-LNPs with diameters from 20 nm to 200 nm, measured by intensity average, were selected.",

In another promising application, Verve Therapeutics is exploring the use of LNP mRNA to deliver a CRISPR/-Cas9 complex to patient cells that will then edit a protein in the liver and correspondingly reduce levels of low-density lipoprotein [9]. Given that an LNP encapsulated mRNA drug is comprised of various chemically diverse molecules brought together in a sophisticated intermolecular complex, there is a major analytical burden on developers to demonstrate that drug substances and products are pure, stable, safe, effective, robustly designed and reproducibly manufactured. Considerations for mRNA testing are quite different than those previously made for other nucleic acid therapeutics, too. Different than chemically synthesized oligonucleotides, the impurity profile of in vitro transcribed mRNA can include nucleotide triphosphates, DNA plasmids and their residual components, as well as various enzymes [10]. To this end, much like liquid chromatography (LC) has been a workhorse for the analytical testing of protein therapeutics, it is also becoming a relied upon technique for LNP mRNA analyses. \n\nIn one case, LC techniques can be applied to analyze the intact mRNA drug substance. Separations by anion exchange (AEX), ion-pair reversed phase (IP-RP) or size exclusion (SEC) chromatography are typically applied and are used to detect heterogeneity or check for molecular integrity. AEX and SEC can also be applied to the LNP encapsulated mRNA. With nuclease digested nucleic acid, it is possible to map the digested components while confirming sequence information, detecting post/co-transcriptional modifications, and investigating nucleobase modifications. It has also become common practice to test lipid and nucleotide raw materials by LC to check for impurities prior to their use in manufacturing. In addition, it has become important to study all of these molecular components even after they have become part of the LNP mRNA drug.",

Previous research and development usually assumed that LNPs are homogeneous in population, loading density, and composition. Such perspectives are difficult to examine due to the lack of suitable tools to characterize these physicochemical properties at the single-nanoparticle level. Here, we report an integrated spectroscopy\u2013chromatography approach as a generalizable strategy to dissect the complexities of multicomponent LNP assembly. Our platform couples cylindrical illumination confocal spectroscopy (CICS) with single-nanoparticle free solution hydrodynamic separation (SN-FSHS) to simultaneously profile population identity, hydrodynamic size, RNA loading levels, and distributions of helper lipid and PEGylated lipid of LNPs at the single-particle level and in a high-throughput manner. Using a benchmark siRNA LNP formulation, we demonstrate the capability of this platform by distinguishing seven distinct LNP populations, quantitatively characterizing size distribution and RNA loading level in wide ranges, and more importantly, resolving composition-size correlations. This SN-FSHS-CICS analysis provides critical insights into a substantial degree of heterogeneity in the packing density of RNA in LNPs and size-dependent loading-size correlations, explained by kinetics-driven assembly mechanisms of RNA LNPs.",

            "text": "In this investigation, we extended the application of the layer-by-layer technique to modify lipid nanoparticles. Initially, we wondered if the reported methodology used first to modify LNPs containing DODMA as an ionizable lipid [28] could be reproduced in other LNPs with different ionizable lipid components. Interesting observations were drawn from this experiment. Our methodology was based on a titration method to identify the minimum amount of polyelectrolyte necessary to fully invert the \u03b6-potential without eliciting destabilization/aggregation of the system (two-fold increase in particle size and PDI) [28]. The method reported previously for DODMA LNPs was successfully reproduced to coat MC3 LNPs but not DODAP LNPs. For the layer-by-layer assembly, the first layer consisted of mixing 14.1 \u00b5L of LNPs at 733 \u00b5M (total lipid content) with 7 \u00b5L of siRNA at 20 \u00b5M. This proportion was enough to invert the charge of DODMA and MC3 LNPs without destabilization of the system (Figure 4, MC3 LNPs, and Supplementary Figure S1, DODMA LNPs) but induced significant aggregation of DODAP LNPs with particles starting at 145 nm increasing over 1 \u00b5m. Therefore, a higher concentration of siRNA (10 \u00b5L at 20 \u00b5M) was necessary to invert the \u03b6-potential to a negative value able to maintain the colloidal stability of the system. Interestingly, there was no need to modify the proportion of PLA and HA as second and third layers, respectively (Figure 1). The higher \u03b6-potential of DODAP LNPs (\u03b6-potential > 30 mV) when compared to DODMA and MC3 LNPs (\u03b6potential between 10 and 20) in sodium acetate buffer (10 mM, pH 4) may be an important parameter to take into account when optimizing the proportion of polyelectrolytes to be used in the LbL assembly of LNPs. \n\nQuantifying the layered-encapsulated siRNA after the layer-by-layer strategy imposes its own challenge.",

Liposomes have been used successfully for a number of small molecule therapeutics 22 while LNPs are the most advanced drug carriers in the clinic for nucleic acid delivery. The physicochemical characteristic of these drug carriers plays a major role in eliminating their toxicity 23 . Several studies have reported that physicochemical attributes such as size, composition, charge, surface area, agglomeration and dispensability can affect the toxicity of liposomes and LNPs 24,25 . The stability of the excipients is also an important prerequisite for drug formulations 26 .\n\nThree dimensional culture models have gained much attention in the recent decades as they closely mimic the in vivo conditions and hence are more suitable than conventional two dimensional cultures 27 . It would be worthwhile to evaluate the toxicity of lipid nanoparticles in 3D culture, as they are an intermediate system between 2D culture and in vivo models.\n\nThe complex composition of liposomes and LNPs is crucial in determining their safety, stability and delivery efficiency when used for clinical applications. Biopharmaceutical companies develop individual in-house references to validate and maintain the manufacturability and quality of these formulations. When regulatory agencies receive these submissions of drug products for approval, the characteristics of each product become unique and details of the methodology and quality control results are usually not comparable. This has largely prolonged the regulatory processes. Certified reference materials (CRMs) are a measurement standard which can be utilized to confirm the physical characteristics and quality of a given product and measurement protocols. In general, CRM is utilized to provide confidence of measurements. Currently, there are no CRMs released from national metrology institutes available for liposomes or LNP",

            "text": "Commonly used ionizable lipids include SM-102 and ALC-0315, among others [62]. Phospholipids can promote LNP stability and fusion with cell membranes and endosomal membranes, facilitating cellular uptake and intracellular RNA release. The commonly used phospholipids in LNP formulations are 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3phosphorylcholine (DSPC) or 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE). Cholesterol effectively enhances LNP stability and promotes fusion with cell membranes. PEG forms a hydrophilic barrier around LNPs, suppressing aggregation and reducing immunogenicity by preventing protein-LNP binding in the blood, thereby prolonging the presence of LNPs in vivo [65]. \n\nNanoparticles made of cationic polymers exhibit characteristics similar to those of cationic lipid nanoparticles (Figure 3B) but also show high cytotoxicity. Recent research has focused more on biocompatible polymer nanoparticles such as PBAEs [66]. Another type of charge-changeable polymer nanoparticle (CART) can release mRNA into cells by rearranging the charges within the particles, indicating promising applications [67]. \n\nThe LPP (lipopolyplex) nano-delivery platform is a bilayer structure with polymer-loaded RNA as the core and lipid wrapping as the shell. It encapsulates the target RNA within a double-layered shell of lipids to protect the RNA molecules from degradation by RNase [68]. LPP combines the advantages of polymers and liposomes, demonstrating good stability, low cytotoxicity, high gene transfection efficiency, and slow release of the mRNAs packaged during polymer degradation. For example, the excellent dendritic cell targeting ability of the LPP platform was used to activate the T-cell immune response through antigen presentation, aiming to achieve the desired immunotherapeutic effect in cancer vaccines [68,69].",

LNPs were diluted to 100 \u03bcM of total lipids in 90 \u03bcL of buffered solutions (triplicates) containing 10 mM HEPES, 10 mM 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid, 10 mM ammonium acetate, 130 mM NaCl, where the pH ranged from 2.71 to 11.5. Ten microliters of stock TNS was added to the LNP solutions and mixed well in a black 96-well plate. Fluorescence intensity was monitored in a Tecan Pro200 plate reader using excitation and emission wavelengths of 321 and 445 nm. With the resulting fluorescence values, a sigmoidal plot of fluorescence versus buffer pH was created. The log of the inflection point of this curve was the apparent pKa of the LNP formulation. \n\nIsolation of protein corona. All experiments were conducted four times to ensure reproducibility. LNP suspensions were incubated with an equal amount of mouse serum for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C (total volume of 350 \u03bcL). The serum coated LNPs were separated from free serum proteins by gel permeation chromatography on Sepharose CL-2B (Sigma) using phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.4) as the eluent. To confirm the separation of LNP and serum, mouse serum was labeled with Alexa Fluor Tm 488 protein labeling kit (Invitrogen, Inc.) and purified according to manufacturer's instructions. LNPs were labeled with Rhodamine-PE. The separation of LNPs (with corona) and proteins was analyzed by measuring fluorescence intensities in different flow fractionations (Fig. S6). Fractions containing LNPs (with protein corona) were merged and lyophilized for 2 days. Finally, the lyophilized powders were dissolved in cold acetone to remove lipid content and denatured with 8 M urea at 65 \u00b0C for 15 min, and processed for SDSPAGE gel or proteomic assays. \n\nProteomic assay.",

            "text": "Two iCIEF methods have been developed, both having their strengths, and united providing many insights into the quality and stability of mRNA vaccines. The highly repeatable methods offer a lot of very valuable information about the preparation, and at the same time they are flexible to optimize them for various kinds of loaded LNPs. Method A, in which 9 M urea was used as an additive, shows two broad and jagged peaks in which the peak shape changes substantially when stress is added to the samples, and therefore detailed information can be derived about stability. Furthermore, the peak pattern exhibits an interesting fine structure, possibly due to different numbers of mRNA molecules within the individual LNPs. The peak area of the sum of both peaks, with RSDs from 2% to 8% when measured in triplicate, very well correlates linearly with the mRNA content and also apparently depends on the size of the LNPs, as was shown by the additional examinations of the stressed samples with the Zetasizer. In method B, a combination of 5.5 M urea and 2 M N-ethylurea was used for LNP separation by iCIEF. This method is characterized by a high repeatability of the pI value (<0.5%). Again, the well repeatable peak area (2%-7%) correlates linearly with the mRNA content, and added stress is evident by the change in pI and peak area. Particle size does not seem to have a strong effect on peak area with this method. Both methods, particularly method A, allow one to characterize LNP stability investigating different storage times and FTCs, and to distinguish between different preparations, including changing lipid compositions and batch-to-batch variability. The developed methods are very sensitive in showing even the smallest changes in the samples, as evident from the measurements of the samples after 1 week of storage in the refrigerator. In addition, empty and loaded LNPs can be clearly differentiated. Therefore, the presented methods offer several advancements compared to previously established physicochemical methods. These results are consistent with the established models for mRNA encapsulated in LNPs [2,46]. Most of the mRNA resides in the center of the LNPs, interacting with the cationic lipid of opposite charge. More detailed information is",

            "text": "The transfection potency of lipid nanoparticle (LNP) mRNA systems is critically dependent on the ionizable cationic lipid component. LNP mRNA systems composed of optimized ionizable lipids often display distinctive mRNA\u2010rich \u201cbleb\u201d structures. Here, it is shown that such structures can also be induced for LNPs containing nominally less active ionizable lipids by formulating them in the presence of high concentrations of pH 4 buffers such as sodium citrate, leading to improved transfection potencies both in vitro and in vivo. Induction of bleb structure and improved potency is dependent on the type of pH 4 buffer employed, with LNP mRNA systems prepared using 300 mm sodium citrate buffer displaying maximum transfection. The improved transfection potencies of LNP mRNA systems displaying bleb structure can be attributed, at least in part, to enhanced integrity of the encapsulated mRNA. It is concluded that enhanced transfection can be achieved by optimizing formulation parameters to improve mRNA stability and that optimization of ionizable lipids to achieve enhanced potency may well lead to improvements in mRNA integrity through formation of the bleb structure rather than enhanced intracellular delivery.",

            "text": "Density contrast AUC offers a rapid and simple assay for the determination of mRNA copy numbers for lipid nanoparticle formulations. We have determined a discrete distribution ranging from 1 to 10 mRNA copies with an average of 5 copies per particle for our LNP formulation. However, potential users should keep two limitations in mind. First, this assay cannot distinguish between full length and degraded mRNA and thus confirm the integrity of the encapsulated nucleic acid. An LNP with 5 mRNA copies will have the same density as a particle with 10 half copies. This must be monitored by other assays such as (capillary) gel electrophoresis during drug substance/drug product characterization. Second, the data analysis assumes that the density and the ionic strength of the solvent inside the particle is the same as that of the bulk solvent. This may not be critical for dilute buffers like PBS but may become an issue in formulations containing high concentrations of excipients, especially salt as it may alter the vbar of the nucleic acid. A special attention should also be paid to the preparation of the D 2 O containing buffer (D 2 O is hygroscopic) as the low density of empty and full particles requires only a few percent of D 2 O to match the density.",

The literature describes two classical types of lipid nanoparticles, namely: \n\n\u2022 solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN), so-called \"1st generation\", \u2022 nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC), so-called \"2nd generation\". \n\nSLN and NLC are known to increase the bioavailability of loaded drugs administered by different routes (199,200). In contrast to SLN, the lipid matrix of NLC consists of a mixture of solid and liquid lipids (that melt above 40\u00b0C). The matrix originates a lessordered matrix with the capacity to load a higher drug amount than SLN, preventing its leakage during storage and allowing a more flexible drug release modulation (201). SLN contains only solid lipids in its matrix, offering the capacity to modulate the release profile of loaded drugs. SLN and NLC require surfactants (e.g., poloxamers, tweens) to stabilize the lipid matrices in aqueous dispersion (202,203). Acylglycerols, waxes, fatty acids, and hard fats are the most commonly used lipids that should be approved by the Food and Drug Administration (191, 204).",

Additionally, phospholipids contribute to the fusogenicity and biodistribution of LNPs. 247 0][251] In addition, DOPE was employed for mRNA and siRNA administration in vivo as an alternative to DSPC since it could destabilize the endosomal members and encourage mRNA entry into the cytosol. 182",

            "text": "Formulations of gold nanoparticles with liposome have been prepared by several different methods: (1) reverse-phase evaporation with gold nanoparticles suspended in the organic phase (Hong, Friend, Glabe, & Papahadjopoulos, 1983;Paasonen et al., 2007); (2) physical adsorption of gold nanoparticles onto the surface of liposomes (Kojima, Hirano, Yuba, Harada, & Kono, 2008); (3) postinsertion of gold nanoparticle-conjugated phospholipids onto preformed liposomes (Chithrani, Dunne, Stewart, Allen, & Jaffray, 2010) and (4) embedding gold nanoparticle in a dry lipid film followed by hydration (Park, Oh, Mun, & Han, 2006). Recently, our laboratory has demonstrated encapsulation of gold nanoparticles in LNP by mixing the commonly used lipids in LNP-siRNA formulation with commercially available negatively charged gold nanoparticles in a microfluidic mixer (unpublished). This method is straightforward as the ionizable cationic lipids bind to the negatively charged gold nanoparticles in a manner similar to the encapsulation of siRNA. Using the same method, LNP encapsulation of iron oxide nanoparticles is potentially possible when they are modified with functional groups such as carboxylic acids or silica to render their surface negatively charged (Laurent et al., 2008). A thermo-sensitive LNP-siRNA system can be generated by co-encapsulating metallic nanoparticles with siRNA using ionizable cationic lipids. Enhanced release of siRNA following cellular uptake may be made possible by excitation of cells or tissues with ultra-violet light or alternating magnetic field to generate enough heat to disrupt or permeabilize the endosomal membrane. \n\nIn addition to the potential benefit of enhancing endosomal release of siRNA, metallic nanoparticles co-encapsulated with siRNA in the same LNP system can also serve as a contrast agent for bioimaging.",

            "text": "The morphological properties of the new Pd(II) complexes-loaded LNPs are revealed using TEM imaging. TEM imaging (Figure 2C,D) revealed that the PdL 1 LNPs and PdL 2 LNPs exhibited a spherical morphology with a narrow size distribution. The TEM images also indicated that the nanoparticles possessed a homogeneous and compact internal structure, suggesting the successful entrapment of the Pd(II) complex within the lipid matrix. With this consistency in size, drug loading and release characteristics may be optimized, which is crucial for the use of LNPs in drug delivery systems (DDSs). By measuring the diameters of 67 individual nanoparticles in each TEM picture, the average diameters of PdL 1 LNPs and PdL 2 LNPs were found to be 69.85 \u00b1 3.1 nm and 73.91 \u00b1 2.8 nm, respectively. \n\nThe dynamic light scattering (DLS) technique offers a non-invasive and efficient means of characterizing the size distribution and stability of nanoparticles, allowing researchers to optimize their formulation and tailor their properties for specific applications [35]. By revealing crucial information regarding the particle size, polydispersity (PDI), and aggregation state, DLS analysis helps to ensure the successful development and utilization of Pd(II) complexes-loaded lipid nanoparticles in various fields, including drug delivery and diagnostics. The DLS analysis results (Figure 2E,F) showed that both PdL 1 LNPs and PdL 2 LNPs exhibited unimodal size distributions, indicating a narrow size range of nanoparticles. The unimodal size distribution of nano gels is essential for their efficacy as DDSs, as it guarantees uniform drug encapsulation and release kinetics [36]. It is worth noting that the mean hydrodynamic diameter of PdL 1 LNPs was measured to be 81.53 \u00b1 2.6 nm, while for PdL 2 LNPs, it was measured to be 90.50 \u00b1 3.3 nm. Furthermore, the PDI values for the PdL 1 LNPs and PdL 2 LNPs were 0.17 \u00b1 0.02 to 0.24 \u00b1 0.05.",

            "text": "NLCs represent an advanced class of lipid-based nanodrug delivery systems, developed as an upgrade of SLNs [76]. By partially substituting the solid lipid core with liquid lipids, NLCs diminish the recrystallization tendency of solid lipids, promoting a disordered structural arrangement. This modification helps to increase the drug-loading capacity while mitigating the reduction in nanoparticle stability that is associated with crystal transition during storage. In recent years, newer forms of lipid nanoparticles have emerged, among which smart lipid nanoparticles (smart LNPs) represent an advanced evolution of lipid-based drug delivery systems. Smart LNPs are an advanced form of lipid-based drug delivery systems that are designed to respond to specific external or internal stimuli, such as pH, temperature, enzymes, or ionic concentrations. These stimuli-responsive properties enable smart LNPs to release their encapsulated drugs or therapeutic molecules in a controlled manner at targeted sites, enhancing drug efficacy, reducing side effects, and improving bio-distribution. As a result, smart LNPs provide an advanced, highly efficient drug delivery system with improved loading capacity and better stability during storage, making them a promising solution for delivering drugs with poor solubility [77]. \n\nOverall, LNPs enhance oral drug stability, significantly improve bioavailability and targeting efficacy, and possess good development potential. Simultaneously, a comprehensive study of the functions of related LNPs holds substantial significance for the development of LNPs that are more suitable for internal absorption.",

            "text": "Rational design and robust formulation processes are critical for optimal delivery of mRNA by lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). Varying degrees of heterogeneity in mRNA-LNPs can affect their biophysical and functional properties. Given the profound complexity of mRNA-LNPs, it is critical to develop comprehensive and orthogonal analytical techniques for a better understanding of these formulations. To this end, we developed a robust ultracentrifugation method for density-based separation of subpopulations of mRNA-LNPs. Four LNP formulations encapsulating human erythropoietin (hEPO) with varying functionalities were synthesized using two ionizable lipids, A and B, and two helper lipids, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) and 1,2-dierucoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DEPE), along with cholesterol and DMG-PEG-2K. Upon ultracentrifugation on a sucrose gradient, a distinct pattern of \u201cfractions\u201d was observed across the gradient, from the less dense topmost fraction to the increasingly denser bottom fractions, which were harvested for comprehensive analyses. Parent LNPs, A-DOPE and B-DOPE, were resolved into three density-based fractions, each differing significantly in the hEPO expression following intravenous and intramuscular routes of administration. Parent B-DEPE LNPs resolved into two density-based fractions, with most of the payload and lipid content being attributed to the topmost fraction compared to the lower one, indicating some degree of heterogeneity, while parent A-DEPE LNPs showed remarkable homogeneity, as indicated by comparable in vivo potency, lipid numbers, and particle count among the three density-based fractions. This study is the first to demonstrate the application of density gradient-based ultracentrifugation (DGC) for a head-to-head comparison of heterogeneity as a function of biological performance and biophysical characteristics of parent mRNA-LNPs and their subpopulations.",

            "text": "These are similar to liposomes and have been used for delivering nucleic acids. They are slightly different from liposomes as they can form micelles or micellar structures inside the particle core. This morphology is fairly easy to alter by changing the formulation and synthesis parameters [50]. LNPs are made up of four major components: (i) ionizable or cationic lipids (which can conjugate with negatively charged nucleic acids), (ii) phospholipids, for the structural integrity of the particle, (iii) cholesterol to impart stability and fusion with target cell membranes; and (iv) PEGylated lipids to enhance stability and circulation [51]. Other functionalities can also be attached to LNPs to promote their targeting ability to specific organs, such as the brain [52]. LNPs have been well explored for the purpose of oral, parenteral, ocular, and topical drug delivery [53]. These are economically viable to fabricate and promising alternatives to most colloidal and micron-sized delivery systems, as they do not require any organic solvent during synthesis and the component lipids are GRAS (generally regarded as safe). Both small molecular and macromolecular drugs can be attached to LNPs. Two types of LNPs with solid matrix have been reported. The first generation of lipid nanoparticles, or solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), are made up of triglycerides, which have a high melting point and are solid at room and physiological temperatures. Hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs can be incorporated into the lipid melt by using techniques such as microemulsion, membrane contactor, coacervation, phase inversion temperature, double emulsion, solvent diffusion, emulsification solvent evaporation, ultrasonication, and several types of homogenization [54]. The second generation of lipid nanoparticles, or nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs), are composed of a less-ordered crystalline structure of the lipid matrix, which promotes higher drug loading capacity [55].",

            "text": "Nanoparticles of diameter 100-200 nm, PDI < 0.3 and zeta potentials (\u03b6) of > \u00b110 mV were deemed desirable, and formulations containing 35%-40% cholesterol were used throughout. A cationic liposome formulation was selected, as anionic liposomes quickly engage with the biological system after becoming opsonized by circulating protein [57,58], resulting in the rapid uptake by the reticuloendothelial system (RES) and toxic effects such as pulmonary hypertension, dyspnea and a drop in circulating platelets and leukocytes [59]. A range of lipid compositions that would yield stable cationic LNPs within the appropriate diameter range were evaluated; the optimum composition was found to be 40 mol% DSPC, 15 mol% DOTAP, 35 mol% cholesterol and either 10 mol% MalLipid 5 [33] or 10 mol% Pam 2 Cys-SK 4 -BAGE4 18-39 2. These LNPs were formulated in Milli-Q water via the thin film hydration method [60], and 10 vol% (final volume) of 10x PBS solution was added after sonication to afford the LNPs in PBS (2 mM); the samples were then analysed by TEM and DLS. The MalLNP sample (including repeats to ensure consistency) gave average particle diameters of 70 nm (PDI 0.236) and a zeta potential (\u03b6) of +30 mV. Storage of the solution for 36 days at 4\u00b0C and reanalysis after this time showed little deviation from these values indicating acceptable stability. To prepare CysBAGE4-MalLNPs, a solution of MalLNP (100 \u03bcL of a 2 mM formulation containing 0.02 \u00b5mol of MalLipid 5), 5 equiv. of CysBAGE4 18-39 and 10 equiv. of TCEP was agitated for 3 h then purified via dialysis. UV-Vis analysis showed the successful loading of 0.06 \u03bcmol of peptide, while the control reaction using NonMal-LNPs demonstrated 0.02 \u03bcmol of loading (see Supporting Information for details).",

The choice and design of microfluidic mixers are often seen as a key driving force affecting the critical quality attributes of the resulting lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). Methods: This study aimed to evaluate LNPs manufactured using two low-cost microfluidic mixers alongside manual mixing (pipette mixing (PM)), followed by characterization studies using orthogonal analytics as well as expression studies to establish whether low-cost microfluidic manufacturing methods are suitable for bench-scale and high-throughput research. Results: The results show that all manufacturing methods can produce LNPs with sizes ranging between 95 and 215 nm with high encapsulation (70\u2013100%), and enhanced analytics showed variations between the LNPs produced using the different mixers. Despite these differences, pipette mixing production of LNPs demonstrated its application as a high-throughput screening tool for LNPs, effectively distinguishing between different formulations and predicting consistent expression patterns both in vitro and in vivo. Conclusions: Overall, these results validate the use of low-cost microfluidic mixers without compromising the efficiency and integrity of the resulting LNPs. This study supports the increased accessibility of small-scale LNP manufacturing and high-throughput screening.",

The delivery system targeting sudomotor nerves needs to be stable in aqueous solution but drug-releasable in response to a certain environment of the transappendageal pathway to efficiently deliver myricetin deeply into the sweat glands. M-LNP was assembled to protect and solubilize myricetin using tristearin (TS) and tricaprylin (TC) comprising the lipid matrix (Fig. 1a). After M-LNP and Nile red-(NR-) LNP containing myricetin and NR, respectively, were prepared using fats (TS), oils (TC), and surfactants [Brij S 100 (BR) and Pluronic P-123 (PL)], their physicochemical properties, including yield, mean particle size (PS), \u03b6-potential (ZP), and surfactant surface load (\u0393 s ) were determined (Supplementary Table S1). PEGylated surfactants covering the surface of LNPs sterically hinder shear-induced particle aggregation. Especially, the lipophilic part (C18 chain) of BR facilitates the surface-initiated crystallization of TS and shields the core of LNPs 24 . Yields of the LNP preparations were > 90% and most myricetin added to form M-LNP was encapsulated in the lipid matrix with an entrapment efficiency (EE) of ~ 99%. PS values of LNPs were below 200 nm, indicating good colloidal stability. The LNPs showed high \u0393 s values of 28-30 mg surfactants per m 2 surface. The surface charge (ZP) of LNPs was almost zero (\u2212 4.6 to \u2212 2.5 mV) because possible negatively charged impurities such as free fatty acids (FFAs) were masked by the high covering effect of PEGylated surfactants present at the lipid-water interface 25 . Unstable particles and aggregates of LNPs usually show rod-, needle-, or platelet-like shapes due to the polymorphic transition of lipid matrices from the \u03b1-or \u03b2'-form to \u03b2-form 26,27 .",

Briefly, lipid nanoparticle was created through the rapid mixing of aqueous and organic phases in a custom-made microfluidic device that uses syringes for each phase, with a 3:1 flow rate (aqueous to organic). Cre mRNA 73 was diluted in 10 mM citrate buffer. cKK-E12 was purchased from Oragnix Inc. (O-8744). C18PEG2K and 18:1 (\u03949-Cis) PE (DOPE) were diluted in 100% ethanol and purchased from Avanti Lipids. Citrate and ethanol phases were combined in a microfluidic device by syringes at a flow rate of 3:1. The diameter and polydispersity of the LNPs were measured using dynamic light scattering (DLS). LNPs were diluted in sterile 1X PBS and analyzed. Particles were dialyzed in Slide-A-Lyzer G2 20 kD dialysis cassettes from Thermo Scientific, and the nanoparticle concentration was determined using NanoDrop. \n\nCell isolation and staining for Cre mRNA delivery experiments Ai14 mice (N = 4 mice/group) was injected with 20\u03b1-OH cholesterol lipid nanoparticle at a total dose of 0.25 mg/kg nucleic acid. Mice were sacrificed, and cells were isolated 72 h after injection with LNPs. Mice were perfused with 20 mL of 1X PBS through the right atrium. The liver, spleen, and lung were isolated. The liver and lung were finely cut and then placed in a digestive enzyme solution with Collagenase Type I, Collagenase XI, and Hyaluronidase at 37 \u00b0C at 550 rpm for 45 min. The spleen was appropriately minced and placed in 1X PBS.

PLD activity on vesicles with matched amounts of enzyme substrate is an order of magnitude lower, indicating that the LNP lipid membrane structure can be used to control enzyme interactions.

Since the PEG-lipid is incorporated into the LNP membrane through the hydrophobic tail (the alkyl/acyl chains), PEGlipids with longer tails are less likely to dissociate from the LNP. Studies have reported this correlation between desorption rate and lipid tail length both in vitro [49,65] and in vivo [51]. Mui et al. [51] showed that PEG-lipid desorption from LNPs in circulation, measured one hour after in vivo administration, was 45% for PEG-lipids with C14 dialkyl chains (the length of the alkyl/acyl groups is reported as CX, where X is the number of carbon atoms in the alkyl/acyl chain) and only 1.3% and 0.2% for PEG-lipids with C16 and C18 dialkyl chains, respectively. Studies have generally found that longer alkyl chains improve LNP stability in biological fluids. That said, even short C12 and C14 dialkyl/diacyl chains provide sufficient stability during LNP self-assembly [49,51]. However, in the presence of a lipid sink (e.g. plasma), which contains endogenous lipid-based particles including lipoproteins and extracellular vesicles plus high levels of albumin with its many hydrophobic pockets [66], the short-alkyl-chained PEG-lipids are prone to dissociating into the endogenous lipid-associating entities. In addition to biological lipid-based nanoparticles in blood, cell membranes can also function as a lipid sink.\n\n3.2.1.1. PEG-lipids mediate indirect targeting capabilities of LNPs. In addition to impacting structural properties such as size and stability, different PEG-lipid molar ratios and compositions greatly influence in vivo distribution and degree of cellular interaction, thereby controlling the ability of LNPs and LNP-like particles",

The final chromatographic conditions consisted of a step gradient with two isocratic holds after various chromatographic conditions were explored during method development. \n\nPotential degradants such as myristic acid, lyso-PC 1 and 2, and stearic acid are more hydrophilic than their parent lipids and eluted in the first isocratic hold. The four main lipid components are highly hydrophobic and eluted in the second isocratic hold. Two isocratic holds were chosen to minimize the effect of each analytes response factor based on mobile phase composition [20]. Impurities or degradants were monitored by loss of four main lipid peaks and percent impurity analysis for any addition of new, unspecified peaks. Percent impurity analysis was performed by integrating any peaks apart from the void, system, and parent lipid peaks. This analysis was monitored and compared in stability studies to the zero time point. As previously mentioned, based on the relative response of each analyte, the universal response of both parent lipids and their degradants are not achievable with this method. It would be worth exploring this method with the use of an inverse gradient or another means to a more universal response for impurity analysis utilizing a CAD. \n\nFigure 2A shows the separation of an mRNA-LNP sample containing PEG-DMG, Cholesterol, Cationic Lipid 1, and DSPC.

However, they pose significant manufacturing and analytical challenges due to their intrinsic structural complexity. During product development and process control, their design, characterization, and quality control require the combination of fit-for-purpose complementary analytical tools. Moreover, an in-depth methodological expertise and holistic approach to data analysis are required for robust measurements and to enable an adequate interpretation of experimental findings. Here the combination of complementary label-free biophysical techniques, including dynamic light scattering (DLS), multiangle-DLS (MADLS), Electrophoretic Light Scattering (ELS), nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), multiple detection SEC and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), have been successfully used for the characterization of physical and chemical attributes of rAAV and LNPs encapsulating mRNA. Methods\u2019 performance, applicability, dynamic range of detection and method optimization are discussed for the measurements of multiple critical physical\u2212chemical quality attributes, including particle size distribution, aggregation propensity, polydispersity, particle concentration, particle structural properties and nucleic acid payload.",

This study evaluates the impact of lipid mixture molar concentration and the addition of sucrose as a cryoprotectant on the size and stability of LNPs encapsulating mRNA. Using a microfluidic mixing technique, we formulated LNPs with varying lipid concentrations and analyzed their size, size distribution, and encapsulation efficiency through dynamic light scattering and a RiboGreen assay. Results indicated that higher lipid concentrations not only improved encapsulation efficiency but also maintained LNPs within the ideal size range of 80-120 nm, crucial for optimal biodistribution and immune cell uptake. Furthermore, the addition of sucrose significantly stabilized the LNPs against size changes during freeze-thaw cycles, particularly at lower temperatures. This study underscores the importance of optimizing lipid and sucrose concentrations to enhance the stability and functionality of LNPs, providing insights that could enhance the efficacy and storage stability of mRNA vaccines.\nHIGHLIGHTS\n\nThe variation in molar concentrations of mixed lipids affects the particle size of LNP-mRNA.\nBuffer exchange using a membrane filter with centrifugation technique can reduce the size and uniformity of LNP particle distribution.\nThe addition of sucrose affects the particle size of LNP-mRNA.\nThe addition of 10 % sucrose as a cryoprotectant can maintain the particle size of LNP-mRNA at 4 and \u201320 \u00b0C.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT",

Due to their biomimetic architecture and the similarity of their lipid components to those of cell membranes, LNPs can easily cross the cell membrane to deliver nanoparticle contents to the desired intracellular sites. After crossing the cell membrane, LNPs can take advantage of the low pH environment within the target cells, promoting endosomal escape and releasing the therapeutic cargo into the cytoplasm. 2",

To stabilise the nanoparticles, Pluronic F-127 was used, and the amount of F-127 was kept at 10 wt.% with respect to the total lipids in the system. These formulations were all well dispersed with no visual sedimentation or phase separation. Specifically, each formulation was characterised by an average particle size and PDI. These values are presented in Tables 1 and 2. The particle size range was 137-300 nm, and the PDI range was 0.15-0.3. These particle size and PDI values are in an expected range for MO-based LNPs, and similar particle size ranges have been observed in previous studies [29,30]. To evaluate the stability of LNPs at RT, particle sizes were also measured after 30 days of standing at RT. There were no significant changes in their size and the physical appearance of the LNPs, implying that the prepared LNPs were stable for the tested time of 30 days (data not included).",

            "text": "[19][20][21][22][23] Whilst composition screens have elucidated the importance of LNP phospholipid components, [9] significant knowledge gaps persist regarding LNP interactions with phospholipases, the resulting effects on the LNP lipid composition and structure, and the potential to harness these changes for stimuliresponsive delivery or sensing. \n\nLipid assemblies, including LNPs, can be characterized using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and small-angle neutron (SANS) to probe the bulk structure of formulations and quantify the effects of lipid composition, [24,25] hydration, [26] pressure/temperature, [27] the location of LNP components [28,29] and payload loading. [30] SAXS/SANS experiments enable exploitation of the high SAXS resolution for phase behavior determination via electron rich interactions and the SANS high contrast generated from exploitation of scattering length density differences in hydrogen and deuterium. [31] The combination of the two techniques offers a powerful tool to probe the structure of lipid systems. However, they cannot provide specific information regarding sample composition or monitor rapid reaction dynamics. \n\nSingle Particle Automated Raman Trapping Analysis (SPARTA), previously demonstrated on a variety of nano-particles, [32] provides rapid, label-free composition-specific measurements of individual LNPs enabling the interrogation of population dynamics over time. As depicted in Figure 1b, SPARTA combines optical trapping and Raman spectroscopy to capture and hold a target LNP while simultaneously acquiring a high-resolution spectrum comprising the LNP's molecular vibrations. SPARTA provides comparative quantification of subtle changes in LNP compositions, including those mediated by PLD, (Figure 1c,d). \n\nHere, we implement SPARTA, small-angle scattering (SAXS/SANS) and fluorescence assays, to investigate the composition and structural response of DOPC-containing LNPs to PLD activity in comparison to PLD activity on vesicles. We assess specific alterations in structure and composition based upon formulation and environment (temperature), and explore the morphology-dependent activity of PLD independent of LNP compositions.",

            "text": "In recent years, advances in field of nanotechnology have demonstrated potential for precision medicine. For instance, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) can be used for the targeted delivery of therapeutic molecules, increasing their bioavailability and pharmacokinetic properties beyond the Lipinski rules (1). Indeed, the development of nucleic acid therapeutics has long been hampered by the inherent hydrophilic nature, large size, and poor membrane permeability of nucleic acids (2). LNPs can be a potent alternative to viral-mediated nucleic acid delivery, with an extensive range of applications such as RNA interference (RNAi) therapy or RNA-based vaccines through intracellular delivery, respectively, of short interfering RNA (siRNA) or messenger RNA (mRNA) (3).\n\nOne of the primary advantages associated with LNPs is their biocompatibility that enables their use in vivo for human therapy (4,5). LNPs are made of two major components: a lipid phase and a water phase containing surfactants. LNPs are generally divided into liposomes with an aqueous core or other LNPs; the latter could be solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) with a solid core and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) featuring a core that is a mixture of solid and molten lipids (6). This subclass of LNPs was initially designed to improve the colloidal stability of lipid carriers and increase the drug payload into the core by controlling the release profile (7). Moreover, they are considered advantageous because their manufacturing processes can be easily scaled up for large production (8).\n\nDue to the nature of their lipid core, these particles are not well adapted for nucleic acid encapsulation. The loading of biomacromolecules such as siRNA or mRNA, therefore, occurs through the association with their shell either by chemical modifications of Polyethylene glycol (PEG) residues (9) or by incorporation of cationic lipids at the level of phospholipid monolayer, thus allowing electrostatic interactions with negatively charged nucleic acids (9)(10)(11)(12). The most chosen cationic lipids are quaternised cat",

Figure 8(A) clearly depicts the inhibition of siRNA migration entrapped inside thermocycle ionizable LNPs (Lane 5-7). To evaluate siRNA stability throughout the thermal cycle, thermocycling siRNA-ionizable LNPs (Figure 8A lanes 2-4) were lysed with 0.2%Triton X 100 and compared to naked siRNA in Figure 8(A) Lane 1. The results demonstrated that the thermal cycle did not cause denaturation or instability of the encapsulated siRNA. These results suggest that thermocycling technology was equally as effective as microfluidics technology in the formulation of stable siRNA-ionizable LNPs without the need for organic solvents, complex multistep processes, or expensive sensitive equipment. The core-shell structure of ionizable lipids, helper lipids, cholesterol, and the PEg shell of LNPs protect anionic siRNA by forming a stable ionic combination that protects it from direct thermocycling exposure (gujrati et al., 2014;Petrilli et al., 2016;Blakney et al., 2019;Samaridou et al., 2020). \n\nThe fluorescence intensity study (Figure 8B) was very similar to gel electrophoresis data. The maximum encapsulation rate was 83.3 \u00b1 4.1% in the 20 th cycle (Figure 8B), which was highly matched with the gel electrophoresis results. The loading of the siRNA inside the thermocycling ionizable LNPs was 3.05%. The 30 th cycle showed a little drop in encapsulation, which might be related to the thermal cycle altering stability of the outer lipid membrane of thermocycle siRNA-ionizable LNPs, but the stability of the siRNA was preserved owing to the electro-dense combination of the siRNA and ionizable lipids.",

            "text": "Stability is a crucial requirement in the industrial production of LNP formulations, and it can be influenced by lipid polymorphism, which refers to phase transformations. 113,174 ifferent methods and lipid types used in LNPs can lead to polymorphism, potentially compromising their stability. 175 For instance, exposure to radiation and high temperatures can trigger lipid polymorphism, resulting in LNP instability. 27 olymorphism has been observed in triglycerides and fatty acids prepared using the hot homogenization method. 175 uring preparation or storage, triglycerides in LNPs may convert from their \u03b1-form to the more stable \u03b2-form, leading to the formation of polymorphic crystalline aggregates and reduced amorphous zones in the carrier matrix, which can result in drug leakage. 176 The kinetics of triglyceride polymorphic transitions depend on chain length, with longerchain triglycerides crystallizing more slowly than shorter-chain ones. 177 As a result, LNP formulations composed of long-chain triglycerides tend to be more stable than those containing short-chain triglycerides. Proper consideration of lipid polymorphism is vital for achieving stable LNP formulations during industrial production. \n\nSterilizing LNPs during industrial production poses a significant challenge due to potential destabilization caused by conventional methods. 116 For instance, \u03b3 radiation commonly used for sterilization can lead to lipid oxidation and chain scission, affecting LNP stability and efficacy. 178 utoclaving may trigger phase transitions and thermal stress, further destabilizing LNPs. 179 Filtration and aseptic processing may cause aggregation or deformation due to shear stress. 180 o address this, alternative sterilization methods like UV irradiation, ethylene oxide sterilization, and mild sterile filtration have been explored. 121 However, each method has limitations and requires careful optimization for each LNP formulation. Thus, selecting an appropriate sterilization method remains critical for ensuring the stability and efficacy of LNPs during industrial production.",

Such protection is otherwise difficult to achieve via modifications to the peptides chemical structure, due to the inherently fragile constituent peptide bonds.

            "text": "In this section, we focus on the analytical methods used to assess the stability of mRNA and mRNA-LNP drug products during their clinical development (leading towards eventual market approval), rather than providing an exhaustive description of all published methods for mRNA and LNP characterization. 38 The analytical toolbox for mRNA and mRNA-LNP characterization will evolve during the progression from pre-clinical development to clinical trials to regulatory approval and the purpose and requirements will be different for each stage of development. For example, pre-clinical work is focused on characterization of materials, understanding the processes, and development of the analytical methods themselves, especially for such new and complex drug products as mRNA-LNPs. During early clinical subsequent stages of development, the purpose of analysis can vary from in-depth characterization of impurities and degradation products, to monitoring the known and proposed critical quality attributes (CQAs) of batches derived from different processes during scale-up. In the late-stage development phase, this emphasis of analysis will shift to batch release, stability studies and establishment of shelf-lives. 39,40 Regulatory agencies also recognize that during different stages of development the depth of product knowledge varies, and thus different quality criteria (i.e., specifications) are appropriate for each analytical method. This is commonly referred to as 'stageappropriate characterization' in which all the accumulated experience from the development stage work should ultimately be the basis for setting the quality criteria for ultimate market approval. The dynamics of this analytical development process are exemplified in the Comirnaty Public Assessment Report where it is mentioned that during the rolling review of the data, additional characterization data and tests were requested before final approval. 41 n a recent review, a Quality-by-Design (QbD) framework for future development, design and control of manufacturing processes for mRNA and LNP products was proposed. In order to implement this approach, a thorough understanding of process parameters (Critical Process Parameters, CPPs), analytical methods, and Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs) is also required. 42 To ensure rapid regulatory convergence of the currently approved mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, they were developed under a more conventional Quality-by-Testing paradigm due to the unprecedented speed with which they were developed and the fact that these products were \"first-in-class\".",

            "text": "One of the most developed methods for mRNA delivery is co-formulation into lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). 10 LNP formulations are typically composed of (1) an ionizable or cationic lipid or polymeric material (see Materials Used for Non-viral mRNA Delivery), bearing tertiary or quaternary amines to encapsulate the polyanionic mRNA; (2) a zwitterionic lipid (e.g., 1,2-dioleoyl-snglycero-3-phosphoethanolamine [DOPE]) that resembles the lipids in the cell membrane; (3) cholesterol to stabilize the lipid bilayer of the LNP; and (4) a polyethylene glycol (PEG)lipid to lend the nanoparticle a hydrating layer, improve colloidal stability, and reduce protein absorption. 19,20 though the mechanism of mRNA delivery by the LNPs is not fully understood, it is generally accepted that these multicomponent LNPs are taken up by endocytosis and can electrostatically attach and fuse with the cell membrane using inverted non-bilayer lipid phases. 21 Interestingly, LNPs can also be exocytosed, posing a challenge to cellular delivery. 22 Initial clathrindependent endocytosis, followed by macropinocytosis, has been identified as a common mechanism for LNP delivery inside cells. 22,23 nce inside the cell, LNPs are routed into early endosomes, followed by late endosomes, and finally the lysosomes where the mRNA contents are enzymatically degraded. 24 A hypothesis termed the proton sponge effect proposes that a few percentage (1%-2%) of LNPs evade degradation as the ATP-driven gradual acidification of the compartments from pH 6.5 to 5-6 promotes protonation of the residual amines of the LNPs and disrupts the endosomal membrane that leads to the endosomal escape of the mRNA content. 25",

            "text": "The characterization of structural features has depended on small-angle scattering (SAS) and/or cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). These techniques are complementary to each another, and provide valuable insights into the complex and dynamic LNP structures. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) provide population-wide information about the average internal structure and size of LNPs in relevant physiological conditions. SAXS has been used to characterize lipidbased nanoparticles for delivery of small-molecule drugs or macromolecular therapeutics (Angelova et al., 2011;Angelova et al., 2017;Angelova et al., 2018;Mathews et al., 2022) and the nanocomplexes they may form with biomolecules (Angelov et al., 2013;Angelov et al., 2014;Angelov et al., 2017;Yu et al., 2023). SANS can take advantage of the natural neutron contrast between lipids and nucleic acids to probe different structural regions within LNPs. As an alternative approach, SANS can exploit the difference in scattering length density (SLD) between hydrogen ( 1 H) and deuterium ( 2 H or D) by isotopic labeling of LNP components to selectively highlight structural regions within LNPs, thus providing detailed insights into LNP morphology (Di Cola et al., 2016;Sebastiani et al., 2021;Leite et al., 2022;Urimi et al., 2022;Yang et al., 2022;Kangarlou et al., 2023). SANS can also provide quantitative information regarding the distribution of molecules within the LNP structure, including water content in solvated regions. Cryo-EM provides direct visualization of the size and morphology of individual particles in hydrated frozen thin films (Kulkarni et al., 2018;Yanez Arteta et al., 2018;Aburai et al., 2020). In a recent example, SANS, in combination with SAXS and cryo-EM, was used to structurally characterize a non-spherical morphology of LNPs containing self-amplifying mRNA (SAM-LNPs).",

            "text": "The novel contribution of this study primarily lies in the enhanced stability and efficiency of the newly developed DMKD-PS lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for mRNA delivery. Unlike previously used lipid nanoparticles, which require storage at temperatures below minus 80 degrees Celsius, the DMKD-PS LNPs demonstrated remarkable structural stability, maintaining size consistency and effectively protecting mRNA even under prolonged refrigeration. This represents a significant advancement in terms of practical storage and handling of mRNA carriers. Additionally, the DMKD-PS LNPs exhibited remarkable resilience in the presence of RNase A, safeguarding the mRNA effectively. Furthermore, even when challenged with Triton X-100, a potent detergent, these nanoparticles resisted complete destruction, underscoring their enhanced stability compared to existing lipid nanoparticles. An important breakthrough of our study is the cytotoxicity profile of DMKD-PS. Despite being strongly positively charged, these LNPs exhibited cytotoxicity levels comparable to neutral-charged lipid nanoparticles, a notable achievement in the field. Moreover, the efficient delivery of GFP mRNA to cells suggests that lower dosages of DMKD-PS can achieve high transmission efficiency, potentially reducing toxicity. Lastly, the systemic administration of DMKD-PS nanoparticles showed that they undergo normal metabolic processing and are safely expelled from the body. While similar to conventionally available mRNA carriers in certain aspects, DMKD-PS's unique characteristics and performance indicate its potential applicability in various fields, including mRNA-based cancer vaccines, warranting further research and exploration. In summary, the DMKD-PS lipid nanoparticles mark a significant step forward in mRNA delivery technology, combining enhanced stability, efficient mRNA protection, low cytotoxicity, and effective systemic processing, thereby opening new avenues in mRNA therapeutic applications.",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are enabling the rapid advancement of nucleic acid therapeutics to the clinic, including promising new modalities like CRISPR ( 1 ,2 ) to treat and possibly cure previously intractable diseases. LNPs typically consist of four components including polyethylene glycol (PEG)-lipids, ionizable cationic lipids, cholesterol and phospholipids in specific molar ratios. The design space for optimizing the four components of LNPs as well as the formulation parameters is very large, potentially to a scale of 10 10 unique LNP formulations ( 3 ). This establishes the need to screen LNPs in a high throughput way. \n\nTypically, a high throughput screen will be done in vitro using a suitable model and lead candidates selected for in vivo studies. While these in vitro screens help to identify promising leads, evidence of poor correlation between in vitro and in vivo results ( 4 ,5 ) make the case for high throughput in vivo screens where the particles can be assessed in a relevant physiological and pathological context. To make in vivo screening of LNPs more efficient, the high-throughput approach should achieve the same outcome as an individual group screenwhich is lead identification and optimization based on functional delivery of the LNP cargo. Novel methods to screen for LNPs in vivo have been developed including the use of DNA barcodes (bDNA) to identify LNPs that target endothelial cells and other tissues ( 6 ,7 ). This approach allows for the screening of > 100 LNPs in a single pool but requires coformulation of the functional nucleic acid (siRNA or mRNA) with a small DNA barcode. The formulation of different types of nucleic acids has however been shown to change the structure of the LNP and potentially alter the LNP delivery, potentially changing the outcome of the screen ( 8 ,9 ). Another approach utilizes barcodes encoded for in the 3 untranslated (UTR) region of the functional mRNA, thus formulating only one type of nucleic acid -an improvement over the bDNA approach ( 9 ).",

            "text": "Genetic therapies derived from interfering RNA (siRNA), mRNA, and plasmid DNA can potentially treat many diseases [1]. However, the immune system can rapidly degrade naked DNA and RNA. Encapsulating DNA or RNA molecules into lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) is a method of overcoming this problem [2]. Encapsulating RNA into LNPs also prevents cleavage by RNase in the blood [3]. Research has shown that LNPs effectively transport genetic material into target cells, both for siRNA and mRNA [4]. Furthermore, LNP is a key technology behind the success stories of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines [5]. \n\nThe LNP structure usually consists of ionizable lipids, structural lipids, and cholesterol. The ionizable lipids have positive charges at low pH and are neutral at the physiological pH. This characteristic of ionizable lipids increases LNP biocompatibility, which is beneficial for genetic drug delivery [2]. Structural lipids play a role in the stability of LNPs, while cholesterol is involved in the intracellular delivery of LNPs [6]. Moreover, cholesterol can maintain the integrity of the LNP structure [7]. LNPs also contain a small amount of DMG-PEG2000 to prevent aggregation [8]. \n\nLNPs were produced by combining nucleic acid with an acidic aqueous buffer and lipid excipients in ethanol, which has the advantage of low toxicity compared to other lipid solvents [9]. Once the LNPs are formed, ethanol must be removed promptly to maintain the integrity of the LNPs. A study by Kimura and coworkers [10] has revealed that post-treatment with ethanol dialysis can stabilize the LNP structure since ethanol can destabilize the lipid membrane. However, the mechanism at the molecular level remains to be determined, and research related to the molecular mechanism of LNPs requires extensive resources and time. \n\nMD simulations have been used to investigate the behavior of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) in drug delivery applications, emphasizing their potential for optimizing LNP designs [11].",

            "text": "The membrane\u2010protein interface on lipid\u2010based nanoparticles influences their in vivo behavior. Better understanding may evolve current drug delivery methods toward effective targeted nanomedicine. Previously, the cell\u2010selective accumulation of a liposome formulation in vivo is demonstrated, through the recognition of lipid phase\u2010separation by triglyceride lipases. This exemplified how liposome morphology and composition can determine nanoparticle\u2010protein interactions. Here, the lipase\u2010induced compositional and morphological changes of phase\u2010separated liposomes\u2014which bear a lipid droplet in their bilayer\u2014 are investigated, and the mechanism upon which lipases recognize and bind to the particles is unravelled. The selective lipolytic degradation of the phase\u2010separated lipid droplet is observed, while nanoparticle integrity remains intact. Next, the Tryptophan\u2010rich loop of the lipase is identified as the region with which the enzymes bind to the particles. This preferential binding is due to lipid packing defects induced on the liposome surface by phase separation. In parallel, the existing knowledge that phase separation leads to in vivo selectivity, is utilized to generate phase\u2010separated mRNA\u2010LNPs that target cell\u2010subsets in zebrafish embryos, with subsequent mRNA delivery and protein expression. Together, these findings can expand the current knowledge on selective nanoparticle\u2010protein communications and in vivo behavior, aspects that will assist to gain control of lipid\u2010based nanoparticles.",

            "text": "Formulation with lipids is one of the most common approaches to enhancing nucleic acid delivery. Mixing polyanionic nucleic acid drugs with lipids leads to the condensing of nucleic acids into nanoparticles that have a more favourable surface charge, and are sufficiently large (~100 nm in diameter) to trigger uptake by endocytosis. Lipoplexes are the result of direct electrostatic interaction between polyanionic nucleic acid and the cationic lipid, and are typically a heterogeneous population of relatively unstable complexes. Lipoplex formulations need to be prepared shortly before use, and have been successfully used for local delivery applications 228 . By contrast, liposomes comprise a lipid bilayer, with the nucleic acid drug residing in the encapsulated aqueous space. Liposomes are more complex (typically consisting of cationic or fusogenic lipids (to promote endosomal escape 231 ) and cholesterol PEGylated lipid) and exhibit more consistent physical properties with greater stability than lipoplexes 232 . For example, some lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), also known as stable nucleic acid lipid particles (Fig. 4f), are liposomes that contain ionizable lipid, phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol and PEG-lipid conjugates 233,234 in defined ratios and have been successfully utilized in multiple instances. Landmark examples are the silencing of hepatitis B virus and APOB by siRNAs in preclinical animal studies 137,235 and, more recently, the approval of patisiran, an siRNA that is delivered as an LNP formulation 236 . Encapsulation of nucleic acid cargos provides a means of protection from nuclease digestion in the circulation and in the endosome. Additionally, ionizable LNPs also associate with APOE, which further facilitates liver uptake via LDLR-mediated endocytosis 237 . Similarly, LNPs containing lipidoid or lipid-like materials have demonstrated robust siRNA-mediated silencing in rodents 238,239 and non-human primates 240 .",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are the most advanced delivery system currently available for RNA therapeutics. Their development has accelerated rapidly since the success of Patisiran, the first siRNA-LNP therapeutic, and the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines that emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic. Designing LNPs with specific targeting, high potency, and minimal side effects is crucial for their successful clinical use. However, our understanding of how the composition and mixing methods influence the structure, biophysical properties, and biological activity of the resulting particles remains limited. While microfluidic technologies have significantly improved the speed and uniformity of LNP production, a major challenge that remains is that ~60-80% of mRNA-LNP formulations are unloaded (empty lipid particles). This study tackles this challenge by relating current standard characterization methods with more powerful emerging methods, including 1. multi-wavelength analytical ultracentrifugation (MWL-AUC), 2. In-line multi-angle light scattering (MALS) methods, and 3. synchrotron size-exclusion chromatography in-line with small-angle X-ray scattering (SEC-SAXS) coupled with singular-value decomposition methods (SVD). We will present the strengths and weaknesses of each approach and showcase the increased detail newer advanced methods provide by comparing LNP formulations made using two common small-scale production methods: microfluidic rapid mixing and bulk mixing. The characterization techniques employed here can enhance our understanding of LNP structure-function relationships and enable researchers to define their RNA LNP products more precisely, which can improve LNP quality and potentially accelerate pharmaceutical development.",

A significant difference was observed for the CSL3/Cer-PEG formulation, which can be explained by the very high size measured by DLS, but no significant difference between the methods was observed for the other formulations. \n\nA PdI between 0.037 and 0.466 was measured for all LNPs, but no correlation with the lipid-PEG length could be made when CSL3/DSPE-PEG LNPs were taken as control (Figure 2B). Unsurprisingly, neutral zeta potential was measured for all of formulations, as LNPs contained ionizable lipids with a pKa lower than 7.0. \n\nFinally, no impact of the lipid-PEG was observed on the siRNA encapsulation level when CSL3 and SM-102/DSPE-PEG were taken as control and compared with the other formulations of the corresponding group (Figure 2D). Similar high levels of siRNA encapsulation (~80%) were observed for all of the CSL3 formulations, as previously measured [11] (Figure 2D), but lower encapsulation efficiencies were measured for SM-102 LNPs with ~50% of encapsulated siRNA. Moreover, statistical analysis confirmed that the SM-102 formulations including Cer-and DTA-PEG showed significantly lower levels of siRNA encapsulation when compared with the corresponding CSL3 formulations.",

The approved ionizable lipid DLin-MC3-DMA (MC3) was used as a positive control. \n\nFirefly Luciferase (FLuc) mRNA was encapsulated into different LNPs, and the particle size, polydispersity index (PDI) and encapsulation efficiency were characterized (Fig. 1c). All HL LNPs exhibited uniform particle sizes (54-76 nm), with PDIs below 0.2, indicating good colloidal stability. The encapsulation efficiency of HL LNPs was generally over 90%, except for HL-2, which had an encapsulation efficiency of around 60%. This result of HL-2 with a shorter tail suggests that tail length plays an important role in encapsulating mRNA. A comparison between HL-3 and its tail-controlled lipid TL-4 further revealed HCQ's role in mRNA encapsulation. TL-4 failed to encapsulate mRNA efficiently, with efficiency below 5%, likely due to its low cpKa of 6.4, which is too low to be protonated and capture mRNA efficiently.",

            "text": "Since nucleic acids are commonly dissolved in buffers with a pH of 4-5, microfluidic mixing is typically followed by dialysis to neutralize pH and remove the remaining organic solvent. Except for the pH variations of formulation buffers studied by Terada et al. [22], the impact of dialysis as a purification step remains rather unexplored. \n\nTo summarize, LNP quality attributes imply characteristics regarding the intact LNP, as well as the nucleic acids and lipids themselves. Although a variety of analytical techniques quantitatively assessing these characteristics exist, as comprehensively reviewed by Fan et al. [23], only a restricted set of analytical methods has been consistently utilized in the context of parameter studies [7,10,21,22]. In particular, LNP physicochemical property assessment comprises surface charge using electrophoretic light scattering (ELS), particle size, and the polydispersity commonly measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS). Additionally, the encapsulation efficiency of nucleic acids in LNPs is determined using fluorescence-based assays. However, lipid content analysis to quantify all lipid components and determine the lipid molar ratio is not routinely conducted, especially not across LNP processing. \n\nHigh performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) approaches are deployed for lipid separation and quantification across their molecular diversity. Reversed-phase (RP)-HPLC serves for the separation of lipid molecular species according to their relative hydrophobicity that arises from differences in head group polarity, tail unsaturation, and alkyl chain length [24]. As most lipids lack chromophores, typical spectrophotometric detection for lipid quantification is not applicable. Here, charged aerosol detection (CAD) can be deployed, where the mobile phase is nebulized and dried, the formed particles are positively charged by a stream of nitrogen, and the charge is measured by a highly sensitive electrometer [25,26]. CAD outperforms the other widespread aerosol-based evaporative light scattering detection in terms of sensitivity and width of the dynamic range [27].",

            "text": "Lipid-based drug delivery systems are the most widely used and marketed systems that include a whole range of carrier types. The most advanced liposomes are large amphiphilic vesicles with a lipid bilayer having both a polar aqueous core and an unpolar surrounding lipid bilayer. More complex lipid nanoparticles such as solid lipid nanoparticles, nanostructured lipid carriers and electrostatic cationic lipid-nucleic acid lipoplexes have a more complex structure and enhanced properties in stability compared to liposomes [50][51][52][53]. Originally, LNPs were developed as vehicles for DNA-based drugs. Over time, they have proven to be reliable delivery systems for siRNA, as they are also able to entrap siRNA and thus protect the siRNA from degradation. The lipid matrix of the majority of siRNA LNPs is composed of cationic or ionizable lipids, neutral helper lipids, cholesterol and shielding lipids [54]. \n\nCationic lipids such as DOTAP [55], DOTMA [56] or DMAPAP [57] can electrostatically form stable complexes with the negative siRNA due to electrostatic interactions, thereby enabling the capturing of siRNA in the LNP. However, the net cationic lipid systems suffer from the so called \"polycationic dilemma\", as a high number of cationic charges favour the formation of complexes, but vice versa suffer from cytotoxic effects due to unspecific interactions with negatively charged cell membranes and blood components [58]. In that regard, research about pH-sensitive ionizable lipids was intensified [59]. Ionizable lipids such as DLin-DMA, DODAP or DLin-MC3-DMA offer a key advantage during the production of LNPs, because their charge can be varied [55]. They can be positively or neutrally charged depending on the pH value of the medium and allow reliable electrostatic complexation with siRNA, resulting in efficient encapsulation during manufacturing. This ability to change the charge at different pH values reduces the toxicity of ionizable lipids [60].",

Appropriate volumes of lipids dissolved in ethanol at the desired ratios were mixed with an aqueous phase containing RNA using a microfluidic device, followed by downstream processing. For the encapsulation of RNA, \u223c2 mg ml \u22121 RNA was dissolved in 5 mM citrate buffer (pH 3.5). The molar percentage ratio for the constituent lipids is 50% ionizable amino lipids, 7% 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (Avanti Polar Lipids), 41.5% cholesterol (Avanti Polar Lipids), and 1.5% 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycerol, methoxypolyethylene glycol (polyethylene glycol chain molecular mass: 2,000) (NOF America). At a flow ratio of 1:3 ethanol:aqueous phases, the solutions were combined in the microfluidic device. The total lipid-to-RNA weight ratio was \u223c25:1 (LUNAR1) or 15:1 (LUNAR2). The mixed material was then diluted 3 times with Tris buffer (pH 7.5) containing 50 mM NaCl and 9% sucrose after leaving the micromixer outlet, reducing the ethanol content to 6.25%. Diluted LNP formulation was concentrated and diafiltered by tangential flow filtration using hollow fibre membranes (mPES Kros membranes, Repligen) and Tris buffer (pH 7.5) containing 50 mM NaCl and 9% sucrose to remove the ethanol. Particle size and polydispersity index (PDI) were characterized using a Zen3600 (Malvern Instruments, with Zetasizer 7.1 software). Encapsulation efficiency was calculated by determining the unencapsulated RNA content by measuring fluorescence intensity (Fi) upon addition of RiboGreen (Molecular Probes) to the LNPs and comparing this value to the total fluorescence intensity (Ft)",

Additionally, all lipids in the self-assembly system show more stability trends than those in the aqueous ethanol system. The increased trends suggest that all lipids in the aqueous ethanol system experience considerable conformational changes, which may correlate to the integrity weakening of the LNP. \n\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4836 5 of 14",

            "text": "Fabricating LNP via microfluidics bears several advantages including precise control over parameters, high reproducibility, and the possibility for industrial scale-up [10,11]. Properties of LNP can be affected by various factors, including FRR, TFR, dimensions of the chip, lipid composition, and buffer choice [32,42]. The success of this method was further proven with the admission of the COVID-19 vaccines [10,42]. Besides the delivery of nucleic acids, those lipidbased nanocarriers including liposomes, self-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SEDDS) and LNP can be promising formulations for oral drug delivery as well. Nevertheless, these systems should stay physically stable, meaning the particles should maintain a homogenous size distribution and prevent aggregation which could further cause phase separation and escape of the encapsulated drug [43]. Furthermore, the formulation can be impacted by lipid degradation either during storage or within the gastrointestinal tract. Especially changes in pH from acidic conditions in the stomach to neutral or alkaline environments in the intestine, variable concentration of salts, and electrolytes and gastrointestinal enzymes like pancreatic lipase are able to degrade those lipid-based nanocarriers, and continuing decomposition could as well lead to undesired drug release [44][45][46]. Possible strategies to overcome these problems can be based on suitable surface coating, e.g., PEG which sterically stabilizes the particles preventing aggregation and also hampers the adsorption of enzymes [45,47]. Moreover, non-digestible components can be chosen for the composition of the nanoparticles. LNP in our study were based on cholesterol, DSPC as structural lipid, MPEG-2000-DSPE as PEGylated lipid, and positive surfactants providing a positive surface charge of LNP. Cholesterol can improve the stability of LNP by modulating the integrity and rigidity of the cellular membrane [11,42,48,49]. DSPC is able to form a lamellar phase which stabilizes the structure of LNP and furthermore facilitates endosomal escape [11,48].",

            "text": "Nanoparticle shape influences how LNPs interact with cell membranes during endocytosis and how they release their encapsulated mRNA into the cytoplasm (Mrazek et al., 2014). By visualizing and manipulating the structure of LNPs, researchers can assess how changes in shape and size impact the delivery process. This is particularly important for optimizing the stability and function of LNPs, as irregularities in shape or size may affect their ability to cross cellular membranes or release mRNA efficiently (Byrgazov et al., 2013). \n\nAnother important application of POLYVIEW-3D is in the design of nanocomposite hydrogels, which are often used in conjunction with LNPs to improve the stability and delivery of mRNA vaccines (Baigorria et al., 2023). The software allows researchers to model how changes in lipid composition or particle size affect the hydrogel's properties, helping to optimize the gel's characteristics for enhanced mRNA delivery (Ege et al., 2023). Nanocomposite hydrogels can provide additional protection for LNPs during storage and transport, and POLYVIEW-3D helps ensure that the LNPs remain stable and effective under different conditions (Baigorria et al., 2023). \n\nBy offering these capabilities, POLYVIEW-3D plays a pivotal role in the optimization of mRNA-LNP vaccines. Its ability to model complex interactions at the molecular level, visualize the structural components of LNPs, and analyze their interactions with cell membranes makes it an essential tool for researchers working to improve mRNA vaccine formulations. Whether fine-tuning lipid composition, modeling particle morphology, or studying cellular uptake, POLYVIEW-3D enables researchers to optimize LNP designs for maximum efficacy and stability in mRNA vaccine development (Bates et al., 2001;Porollo et al., 2004).",

            "text": "Many studies have been performed, even if most examples published to date focus on lipidomics [120][121][122][123][124][125]. \n\nIn previous work, a standard mixture of lipids was prepared and diluted in methanol so that it contained 0.5 ng/\u00b5L MC3, 0.5 ng/\u00b5L DSPC, 0.5 ng/\u00b5L DMG-PEG-2000 and 2 ng/\u00b5L cholesterol [126]. This sample was then analyzed using electrospray ionization with a benchtop time of flight mass spectrometer. Extracted ion chromatograms for each of the 4 lipids are shown in Fig. 10 A. The lipids were eluted in the order of DMG-PEG-2000, cholesterol, ionizable lipid MC3 and DSPC when separated on a charged surface, C18 bonded 1.7 \u00b5m particle column using a ternary gradient with acetonitrile and isopropanol containing eluent. With this work, we also studied the serial dilution of each individual lipid in concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 500 pg/\u00b5L. The lower limit of detection (LLOD) was determined to be 5 pg/\u00b5L (25 pg on column) for the ionizable lipid MC3, DSPC and DMG-PEG-2000. The LLOD for cholesterol was determined to be 250 pg/\u00b5L (1.25 ng on column). 11 B), low energy parent ion spectrum (Fig. 11 C) and corresponding characteristic fragment ions (Fig. 11 D). An approach to lipid analysis, like this one, that incorporates high resolution, high mass accuracy MS is coming to be adopted, because it can strengthen the information known about incoming raw materials, aid the design of novel synthetic lipids, produce more insights during formulation stability studies, and give new tools for drug development and quality control. \n\nLNPs are comprised of four known lipid components and quantitation can be performed using ELSD, CAD or mass spectrometry. Successful quantitation is based on a proper analytical method paired with the appropriate internal standards.",

            "text": "Typical LNP formulations include phospholipids, cholesterol, positively charged glycolipids, and PEGylated lipids that make up the cell membrane [25]. Phospholipids, a component of cell membranes, act as a skeleton for LNPs and aid in the release of LNPs from endosomes [26]. Although considered as the backbone, their immunogenicity differs depending on the type of phospholipid; therefore, it is necessary to optimize the phospholipid composition [25]. Owing to its hydrophobic nature, cholesterol is placed between the lipid bilayers to increase the rigidity of the LNPs, thus increasing the stability of the latter. Polyethylene-glycol (PEG)-modified lipids provide a shielding layer that minimizes the non-specific binding of LNPs to proteins or cells in vivo [27]. However, immune responses of PEGylated nanoparticles have recently been reported, leading to research on alternative materials [27,28]. When PEGylated drugs are administered intravenously, the formation of anti-PEG antibodies may occur, leading to an Accelerated Blood Clearance (ABC) phenomenon with subsequent doses. Consequently, the drug can be rapidly eliminated from the bloodstream. These phenomena have been observed repeatedly in PEGylated drugs and nanoparticles, resulting in reduced therapeutic efficacy by lowering drug residence time in the bloodstream. In addition, the rate of elimination from the body differs based on whether the lipid tail structure is symmetrical versus asymmetrical [29].",

            "text": "We can, therefore, use such an analysis to determine whether, in a given sample, DNA is present within an intact lipid particle or whether the particle was destroyed and the DNA was thereby released. For LNPs to be suitable surrogates for bacteria, they need to have the same or similar susceptibility toward disinfection with common disinfectants, which usually comprise high concentrations (\u226570 v %) of ethanol. 11 To investigate the disintegration of LNPs due to contact with ethanol, UV\u2212vis spectra were recorded of LNP dispersions with varying ethanol concentrations, see Figure 4. At low ethanol concentrations, the solutions remained highly turbid, with significant light absorption in the low-wavelength range, consistent with small particle light scattering. 22 In samples with high ethanol concentrations, the absorbance decreased, and at ethanol concentrations exceeding 70 v % (=56 wt %), the solutions appeared clear and resulted in a significant decrease in optical absorbance, indicating a full dissolution of the LNPs. This  . Scheme for the procedure of the surface test. First, LNPs are dried on a surface (here: a steel worktop of a laminar flow bench) and then treated through wiping with a tissue moistened with various liquids. After that, MilliQ water is pipetted on the surface to take the sample (rehydration). Subsequently, the sample is analyzed as described above (Figure 1). behavior of the LNPs corresponds to the one exhibited by bacteria, which are effectively dissolved and the lipid shell is destroyed, when treated with ethanol solutions of concentrations of 70 v % or higher and remain mostly unharmed when ethanol concentrations lower than 50 v % are used for disinfection. 23  similar effect can be observed when LNPs are contacted with SDS solutions (see Supporting Information, Figure S1). In this case, it is expected that the surfactant results in a disintegration of the original LNPs and the formation of lipid micelles, very similar to the action of detergents toward microorganisms. 10 urface Test. The above UV\u2212vis analysis shows that LNPs dissolve in ethanol solutions and in the presence of common detergent solutions (e.g., SDS).",

            "text": "Nanoparticle diameter (size) and polydispersity of lipid formulations with various RNA cargo sizes was analyzed (Fig. 5). Polydispersity index (PDI) is a normalized value that indicates nanoparticle size range in a sample, and is a useful indicator of sample quality. In samples with high dispersity, larger particles in the distribution will tend to aggregate and sediment, which leads to diminished effective RNA concentration and inconsistent dosing. Typically, LNP formulations developed for biological application should have a PDI below 0.2, which indicates the colloid is acceptably monodisperse 38 . Monodispersity of nanoparticle drugs is crucial to ensure the consistent behavior of the intended drug, as size influences how particles interact with the body. \n\nDLS size and polydispersity analysis suggests that there is no significant correlation between cargo size and LNP hydrodynamic diameter in the regime of high ionizable lipid excess. This partly agrees with published literature which argues that LNP size is primarily influenced by concentration, flow rate (for particles synthesized using a microfluidic system), and PEG-lipid concentration. However, there has been speculation that differences in cargo size and morphology should affect LNP size 8 . This is because compartmental organization of lipids and cargo within an LNP differs based on cargo size 39,40 . For example, smaller cargo with minimal secondary structure (ASO, siRNA), would likely pack more densely in the LNP core. Whereas larger RNA with complex secondary structure would pack less densely with fewer RNA molecules per LNP. These morphological differences could reasonably exert control over LNP diameter, to some extent. However according to our study, there is no discernable trend between cargo size and LNP size. LNPs without RNA cargo (empty) are generally smaller than particles containing RNA, but there are exceptions. For example, MC3 and DOPE LNPs loaded with 10 base ASO, 96 base aptamer, and 1929 base mRNA are 105 nm, 88 nm, and 102 nm, where the empty particles are 120 nm. However, this further suggests that size is not dictated by cargo size but rather by the mixing parameters and lipid composition.",

            "text": "LIPID NANOPARTICLES FOR MRNA DELIVERY Due to their size, polyanionic nature, and hydrophilicity, the intracellular delivery of mRNA molecules cannot generally rely on passive diffusion across cell membranes. Furthermore, nucleic acids are rapidly degraded by endogenous nucleases in physiological fluids. To overcome these challenges, LNPs incorporating ionizable lipids have been developed as delivery vehicles for siRNA and mRNA, serving both to protect the delicate cargo from degradation in vivo and to enable delivery into the cell. LNPs for mRNA delivery generally comprise a zwitterionic phospholipid, cholesterol, a polyethylene glycol (PEG) lipid, and an ionizable lipid. 45,46 Engineering the lipid structure 47 and particle surface has thus been pursued as a strategy to enhance cellular uptake and endosomal escape 48,49 while specific nanostructural features of the LNP, such as nonlamellar lipid phases, have also been suggested to affect delivery efficiency. 50 LNP interfacial interactions with the cell membrane initiate the internalization of the mRNA; then, inside the cell, the more acidic environment protonates the ionizable lipid, reversing the electrostatic interactions to release the RNA cargo for translation and subsequent protein expression. This is of course an oversimplified description, and the reader is directed to some excellent recent reviews that address these intracellular aspects in more detail. 45,51 The LNP morphology, lipid packing, and microenvironment of the encapsulated mRNA are thus plausibly connected to the delivery efficiency, emphasizing the central significance of higher-order structure associated with both the mRNA and LNP. \n\nThe challenges of LNP preparative scale-up and large-scale processing represent another interesting point of distinction between mRNA-vaccines and biologic drugs. While LNPs may be prepared at bench-scale using pipets and simple manual mixing, 52 their cGMP scale-up for clinical/commercial use employs finely controllable rapid-mixing platforms involving multiple processing steps. 53,54 In contrast, the large-scale production of many biologic drugs can be based on relatively simple thaw\u2212filter\u2212fill drug product production processes.",

            "text": "CAD outperforms the other widespread aerosol-based evaporative light scattering detection in terms of sensitivity and width of the dynamic range [27]. Both performance parameters can be further improved by optimizing the built-in power function value (PFV), which linearizes the detector's response. Here, several strategies to determine the optimal PFV were explored, including experimental, empirical, and mathematical approaches [28][29][30][31]. These studies exclusively optimized the PFV for one particular substance, while the literature lacks PFV optimization studies considering multi-component systems such as LNPs. \n\nThus far, the developed RP-CAD methods for various components of LNPs comprise the lipid quantification of phospholipids [29], PEGLs [32,33], liposomes [34], \n\nLNPs [19,20,[35][36][37], and further stability studies to monitor the degradation products of the prior listed components [29,33,34,36]. Considering the RP-CAD method application on LNP formulations, different objectives were pursued besides method validation. Li et al. [35] focused on the variation of key chromatographic parameters critical for separation such as the stationary phase, ion-pair agent, and column temperature, while Kinsey et al. [36] and Bender et al. [20] further studied forced lipid degradation. For method development, Kim et al. [19] pursued an alternative strategy, employing an analytical quality-by-design approach. However, these studies proved their methods with solely final formulated LNPs and, except for Kim et al. [19] and Bender et al. [20], with partly unknown lipids and lipid molar ratio specifications. Thus far, no analytical method has been employed across processing nor has the effect of process parameter variations on lipid-related LNP attributes been considered. \n\nIn this study, we present a novel holistic RP-CAD method for lipid quantification across LNP production and processing. Based on an experimental approach, we systematically varied the PFV using a simplified lipid stock solution set, focusing on identifying a single PFV for multiple lipids.",

            "text": "The natural LNPs prepared in this study include CSL-LNPs, BJL-LNPs, and SO-LNPs, all of which exhibit favorable physical and chemical characteristics. The Z-average sizes of CSL-LNPs, BJL-LNPs, and SO-LNPs were 170.6 \u00b1 0.3, 164.8 \u00b1 2.3, and 187.2 \u00b1 2.4 nm, respectively. The surface potential ranged between 44 and 50 mV, and the PDI was <0.2, indicating high stability. Additionally, the N/P ratio of the three natural lipid  nanoparticles was 2:1, demonstrating a high RNA adsorption capacity. These physicochemical characteristics are comparable to those of commonly used cationic LNPs for small nucleic acid delivery (Gregersen et al. 2024;Nabar et al. 2024;Zhao et al. 2024). \n\nIn vitro studies revealed that the natural LNPs exhibited high siRNA transfection efficiency both before and after lyophilization, with CSL-LNPs showing higher transfection efficiency than BJL-LNPs and SO-LNPs. Furthermore, the transfection efficiency of CSL-LNPs was comparable to that of the commercial transfection reagent Lipo. Our results confirm that natural lipids from traditional Chinese medicine, such as CSL and BJL, can be used to construct LNPs for siRNA delivery. These natural LNPs effectively overcome challenges associated complex preparation, high cost, and low biocompatibility found in synthetic lipids, such as ionizable cationic lipids and cationic lipids. Additionally, they address the issue of high stability required for the storage of conventional LNPs. \n\nVarious types of lipids, such as ionizable lipids, cationic lipids, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), and nanostructured liposomes (NLCs), are widely used in the development of LNPs for small nucleic acid delivery (Tenchov et al. 2021;Viegas et al. 2023;Wu et al. 2024).",

As one of the critical attributes, understanding mRNA lipid nanoparticle (LNP) stability is critical in the vaccine product development. However, the correlation between LNPs\u2019 physiochemical characteristics and their potency still remains unclear. The lack of regulatory guidance on the specifications for mRNA LNPs is also partially due to this underexplored relationship. In this study, we performed a three-month stability study of heat-stressed mRNA LNP samples. The mRNA LNP samples were analyzed for their mRNA degradation, LNP particle sizes, and mRNA encapsulation efficiency. In vitro cell potency was also evaluated and correlated with these above-mentioned physiochemical characterizations. The mRNA degradation\u2013cell potency correlation data showed two distinct regions, indicating a critical cut-off size limit for mRNA degradation. The same temperature dependence was also observed in the LNP size\u2013cell potency correlation.",

Comparing the characteristics of 26a,b LNPs against 16dc revealed that LNPs containing triple-tail lipids still could form small but relatively heterogeneous nanoparticles with great mRNA encapsulation efficiency (Fig. 2 A and B). In vitro mRNA transfection data revealed that 16dc LNPs were the most potent in HeLa, 26a LNPs in the HepG2, and 26b LNPs in HEK293 (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). Notably, only 26a LNPs could transfect the liver from intravenous administration but to a lesser extent than 20a,b LNPs (Fig. 2F). It was also not as potent as lipid 16dc in intramuscular delivery (SI Appendix, Fig. S2). Therefore, there may not be a significant delivery benefit from adding a third lipid tail. \n\nRearrangement of the Building Blocks. Next, we investigated the arrangement of the building blocks. We separated the lipid tails to the opposing sides of the thiophene core and modified the ester to carry the ionizable headgroup. The resulting lipid 29d maintained the capability to form robust LNPs, although somewhat heterogeneous in shape and internal structure (Fig. 2D).",

            "text": " further example shows how CPP-decorated LNPs were used to achieve efficient internalization into B16F10 murine melanoma. To achieve this, the lipid DOPE was functionalized with a CPP derived from protamine (RRRRRRGGRRRRG) to form the lipid peptide conjugate (DOPE-CPP). Interestingly, DOPE-CPP (6 mol % to total lipids of LNP) was added postformulation to incubate the LNPs for 30 min at 40 \u00b0C. Impressively, the presence of DOPE-CPP increased the stability of the LNPs containing fluorescence-labeled siRNA. The CPP-LNPs were efficiently internalized into B16F10 murine melanoma cells, while LNP without CPP was hardly internalized into these cells. 58 esearch is also continuing on new CPPs for liposomes and LNPs. For example, Sagimoto et al. investigated the influence of a new lipid functionalized with the peptide sequence KK-(EK)4 with regard to cellular uptake. Lipid-based formulations are formulated by mixing the dissolved lipids and subsequently removing the solvent. In this specific case 1% of the composition was the KK-(EK)4-lipid. The liposomes as a reference were treated with 6 mol % at 60 \u00b0C for 1 h postformulating. For both liposomes and LNPs a 2\u22123 fold increase in cytoplasmic fluorescence signal in A549 cells could be observed, in the case for the liposomes referred to a rhodamine dye and for the LNPs due to protein expression levels of the luciferase protein. In both cases the samples were compared to the nonfunctionalized particles and explained by the increased endosomal escape efficiency. 42 owever, none of these examples have completely eliminated off-targeting or dramatically increased the efficiency of delivery, which represent two major challenges for future nanomedicine.",

            "text": "Lipid-based drug delivery platforms use fats or lipids as the main structural component of a nanoscale delivery device. Liposomes are formed when neutral charged lipids form a single bilayer around an aqueous core. Historically, they have been the most widely studied lipid-based system for delivery of small-molecule drugs [91,92]. Payload can be contained within the aqueous core or within the fatty bilayer (figure 4). Specific advantages include drug payload size and modifiable physicochemical properties. Disadvantages include less structural stability compared with other nanoparticle types [93]. \n\nHowever, it is other lipid-based nanocarriers that have shown the most promise thus far as drug-delivery devices for antioxidant therapeutics [94,95]. Unlike liposomes, these lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) contain a core of lipid and active drug, without an aqueous phase (figure 4). Lipid carriers have been used to deliver antioxidants in a variety of disease contexts ( PAD [74] CKD patients [75] Phase 2a clinical trial for STEMI [76] HF (NCT02388464) [77,78] Primary mitochondrial myopathies [79,80] Renovascular hypertension [81] Barth syndrome [ In general, lipid-based therapeutics such as LNPs and liposomes have great potential for improving MTA delivery to the airways. Characteristics such as high drug encapsulation and loading, biocompatibility and stability make them a promising approach for this type of therapy. Future research should be focused on drug loading of MTAs to lipid-based therapeutics as well as investigations in different in vitro and in vivo models of airways diseases.",

Schematic representation of the membrane protein assembly into nanodiscs process using in situ DLS as a high-throughput analytical tool to probe best protein:MSP:lipid condition. \n\nAutomation, miniaturisation, and even integration have played a critical role in research. Reducing the number of repetitive manual tasks, in our case here, several SEC runs or individual DLS measurements, considerably decreases potential for error. In addition, it would also significantly increase savings in terms of time and costs. This allows researchers to concentrate on research rather than repetition. In our study, we only tested four different conditions regarding to lipid composition and MSP:lipid ratio; however, with the use of in situ DLS as a high-throughput analytical tool, many other parameters could be tested such as stability of the protein in study, different construct lengths of the MSP to probe different nanodisc sizes and stability of the newly assembled nanodiscs over time. \n\nIn summary, our study and results not only stress the importance of high-throughput approaches in modern lipidic nanodisc technology, but also the importance of developing and adopting new strategies that fast find the best nanodisc assembly protocol. Moreover, high-quality protein-nanodisc particles will significantly improve the data collection quality on the downstream biophysical applications such as cryo-EM, NMR and SPR.",

They are crucial for encapsulating and stabilizing mRNA molecules, facilitating their effective delivery into target cells (Li et al., 2022a). The structural composition of LNPs, typically including lipids, cholesterol, and polyethylene glycol (PEG) (Hald Albertsen et al., 2022), directly influences their efficiency and efficacy. Key structural features, including lipid headgroup interactions and the arrangement of hydrophobic tails, play a critical role in the ability of LNPs to fuse with cell membranes and effectively deliver mRNA payloads. Designing and optimizing LNPs for mRNA cancer vaccines demands advanced computational tools capable of modeling and visualizing these complex structures and interactions. Tools such as NANOdesign, POLYVIEW-3D, and PyMOL are indispensable in this process. Figure 4 depicts the various sections of the mRNA-LNP complex that must be designed, optimized, and characterized using these bioinformatics tools. This figure highlights how these tools contribute to achieving stable, functional, and highly efficient mRNA-LNP formulations, addressing aspects from pharmacology to pharmaceutical applications. By utilizing these resources, researchers can fine-tune parameters such as lipid composition, particle size, and surface properties to improve the performance and stability of LNPs in mRNA cancer vaccines.",

Intriguingly, mRNA-LNPs are known to form both spherical and highly nonspherical morphologies (9,11,16,18,19), but the origins and practical implications of these morphological variants SIGNIFICANCE The clinical utility of messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines delivered in lipid nanoparticles has recently been highlighted by their use in SARS-CoV-2 vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) and Moderna (mRNA-1273). The lipid nanoparticle is a complex entity in terms of structural and physical attributes that influence biological efficacy and pharmaceutics. One of the most fundamental yet elusive questions has been the nature and location of the mRNA payload inside the lipid nanoparticle. Elucidating this detail via direct experimental methods has been a major objective in the field of RNA delivery. Here, we show that a combination of dye-binding and cryo-electron microscopy pinpoints the mRNA location, providing new insights into its encapsulation state and chemical microenvironment. remain unclear. Molecular simulation studies (20) indicate that the LNP structure may involve solvent pockets, and experimental studies have shown nonspherical morphologies to be associated with segregation of the bilayer-forming 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC) component, resulting in pronounced blebs (11). Despite significant efforts to pinpoint the nucleic acid payload, the precise location of mRNA molecules within LNPs has not heretofore been unambiguously identified via direct experimental methods.\n\nOne difficulty with the analysis of LNPs is that many biophysical techniques produce a globally averaged signal or have limited selectivity for the RNA molecule within the solid particle. Although cryo-EM is a powerful tool for visualizing LNPs, the mass density contrast alone is not distinctive enough to unambiguously resolve RNA from lipidic components. To overcome these limitations, we explored the concept of using an RNA-binding dye to",

            "text": "The exploration of ZwiLNPs for siRNA delivery has shown promise as a method for improving the therapeutic management of hypercholesterolemia. Our findings indicate that ZwiLNPs enhance siRNA stability in circulation and improve cellular uptake and endosomal escape compared to conventional lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). These improvements are primarily attributed to zwitterionic lipids' unique charge regulation properties, which allow for a self-modifying charge profile that adapts to environmental conditions. Although these advancements represent meaningful progress in RNA delivery, it is essential to consider the limitations highlighted throughout our study, particularly those relating to the general challenges associated with LNPs and the specific complexities of charge regulation. \n\nOne of the notable challenges in the delivery process of LNPs is achieving precise targeting and efficient cellular uptake. While ZwiLNPs demonstrated a superior ability to escape from endosomes, as evidenced by reduced co-localization with LysoTracker\u2122 staining, complete cellular internalization remains a hurdle. LNPs can encounter various biological barriers, including serum proteins that may opsonize the particles, leading to rapid clearance by the mononuclear phagocyte system. This often results in inconsistent dosing and diminished therapeutic efficacy. In our study, significant reductions in serum LDL and hepatic PCSK9 levels were observed, indicating successful target silencing; however, the variability in individual responses across different mouse models suggests that factors like immune response and tissue perfusion require further investigation. Developing strategies to enhance specificity and minimize systemic exposure will be crucial in advancing LNP technologies for more reliable therapeutic outcomes. \n\nAdditionally, while the zwitterionic nature of the ZwiLNPs has shown beneficial properties, charge regulation presents significant challenges. The delivery of mRNA and siRNA is heavily influenced by charge interactions between nanoparticles and cellular membranes. The balance is delicate; while cationic lipids can enhance membrane fusion and uptake, excess positive charge can lead to cytotoxic effects and provoke unwanted immune responses. Although we have improved endosomal escape through the proton sponge effect, further optimization in charge tuning remains essential. This necessitates ongoing investigation into the physicochemical properties of LNPs in various biological contexts.",

            "text": "However, this behavior was not observed in HL LNPs. For HL-3 LNP and HL-6 LNP, the TNS fluorescence signal remained at the baseline across the entire pH range, preventing the calculation of the apparent pKa. In HL-5 LNPs, fluorescence was detected, but it was significantly lower than that of its tail control SM-102, suggesting distinct structural properties. These observations indicate that HL LNPs may have a novel particle structure, differing substantially from conventional LNPs. The same pKa trends were observed for empty LNPs formulated without mRNA, confirming the structural differences (Supplementary Fig. 18). \n\nTo further characterize the physicochemical differences, we measured the zeta potentials of the LNPs across different pH buffers (Fig. 2d). Using a phosphate buffer ranging from pH 5.2 to 8.3, we observed that the zeta potential curves for conventional LNPs (SM-102, TL-4, CL-17) matched their fluorescence-pH profiles. However, HL-3 and HL-6 LNPs exhibited consistently strong negative zeta potentials in neutral and basic environments, implying a significantly higher negative surface charge compared to their conventional counterparts. For HL-5 LNP, the zeta potential curve aligned with SM-102, likely because of the structural similarity in their tails. These data suggest that the lipid distribution within HL LNPs can be quite different from that in conventional LNPs, despite having the same formulation. \n\nTo assess the surface lipid distribution of LNPs, we dialyzed the particles against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 5% D 2 O and subsequently analyzed the resulting 1 H NMR spectra. Despite identical formulations, HL-3 and HL-6 LNPs exhibited significant differences in surface group distributions compared to SM-102 and HL-5 LNPs. Specifically, chemical groups corresponding to shifts at approximately 1.5 ppm, 2.4 ppm, and 4.0 ppm were notably reduced in HL-3 and HL-6 \n\nLNPs, particularly those associated with tertiary amine and ester-linked methylene groups (Fig. 3a, b).",

Cationic or ionizable lipids, such as 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium propane (DOTAP) or clinically approved DLin-MC3-DMA, primarily interact with negatively charged mRNA backbone to form electrostatic bonds, thus stabilizing the particles with enhancing encapsulation efficiency as well as the transduction efficacy [17,26,29,30].Sterols, mostly present as cholesterol, are in charge of securing the particle's formation as a building block supplement.The cholesterol also shows the potential of enabling cellular uptake via ApoE-binding and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-mediated endocytosis [31,32].Helper lipids, resembling the cell membrane bilayers, maintain LNP stability by filling the particles with hydrophobic lipid tails [33,34].PEG-anchored lipids regulate particle size by controlling the fusion rate of vesicles during LNP formation while playing a substantial role in enhancing the in vivo bioavailability and biocompatibility, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacology [35][36][37].",

Liposome protein interactions have been studied using imaged capillary isoelectric focusing (icIEF) [18] and CE has been applied to study other types of large particles such as bacteria, viruses, colloidal/nanoparticles, and polymeric particles [19][20][21][22][23][24].

However, these gel-based electrophoretic techniques are labor intensive and qualitative in nature.

            "text": "Liposomes or lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are the self-assemblies of lipids in aqueous environment, and the presence of hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions makes them ideal candidates for the encapsulation of a variety of therapeutic molecules [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9]. However, liposomes are susceptible to leakage and aggregation because of hydrolysis and oxidation of lipids [10], and therefore, the physical stability of liposomes becomes an important consideration for their applications as drug carriers [11,12] and vaccines [13][14][15]. The hydrophilic headgroup and the hydrophobic acyl chain length of the constituent lipids determine the overall packing behavior, surface charge, and the interfacial stability of the liposomes or lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) [16,17]. The packing parameter (P) of the constituent lipids is defined as where V is the hydrophobic volume, S is the surface area of the occupied by the polar region, and L c is the extended length of the hydrophobic tail chain [18][19][20]. Therefore, the choice of the constituting lipid governs the thermal stability owing to the melting, and other temperature-dependent characteristics of the lipids which attributes to the leakiness of the lipid bilayer. Lipid membrane leakage is undesirable because it decreases the efficacy and shelf life of liposomes [21][22][23]. An approach to overcome this leakage is to modify the acyl tails by introducing light-sensitive polymerizable moieties [24][25][26]. The cross-linked acyl tails in the presence of light of a suitable wavelength changes conformation to release the contents in the organ of interest [27,28]. In the absence of the light, the links in the acyl chain do not change conformation and prevent the leakage of contents [29,30]. Furthermore, steric stabilization or prevention of aggregation can be induced by introducing polymers and block co-polymers such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)",

There are few reports on the lyophilization of lipid-based nanoparticles for mRNA delivery. 41,42 Zhao et al. reported that lyophilization of mRNA nanoparticles using lipid-like material maintained in vitro efficacy but abolished in vivo efficacy, possibly due to nanostructure change during the lyophilization process. 41 Muramatsu et al. reported that lyophilization of the LNP-mRNA vaccine showed preserved physicochemical properties and mice immunogenicity for 12 weeks of storage at room temperature and 24 weeks of storage at 4 C. 42 To protect LNPs from physical stress, we employed sucrose as a cryoprotectant, the commonly used excipient in lyophilized liposomes. 43 Sucrose acts as a cushion by replacing water molecules between particles and protects the particles from physical stress to maintain integrity. 39 Lyophilization and not freeze-thawing increased particle size across all formulations tested, indicating that the major stress stems from drying and reconstitution ( Figure S4). Interestingly, only particle size was increased without aggregation and mRNA leakage during lyophilization and storage ( Figures S4 and S5D). We speculate that a trace amount of water in the cake triggered particle size increase through Ostwald ripening. 44 LNP-CoV mRNA containing L202 elicited a balanced Th1/Th2 response, as against a Th2-biased response by protein with alum adjuvant. LNP-mRNA is primarily distributed in antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in lymph nodes, not in T cells and B cells. It remains unclear why LNPs were preferably localized to APCs. Several groups reported that LNPs containing a class of ionizable lipids were taken up into APCs via the endocytosis pathway 45 or ApoE-independent pathway, 46 while being taken up into hepato",

We conducted a comprehensive characterization of the physicochemical properties utilizing the optimal HTO12, HTO14, HTO16, and SM-102 LNPs, including particle size, polydispersity index (PDI), zeta potential, pKa, and stability ( Figs S13 and S14, Table S1).

The pKa values of HTO LNPs were observed to range from 6.4 to 6.5 ( Fig. S13). Both HTO12 LNP and SM-102 LNP exhibited substantial stability to maintain their integrity for a duration of four weeks in PBS at 4\u00b0C ( Fig. S14A and B) and 6 h in 10% FBS at 37\u00b0C ( Fig. S14C a nd D) [43 ]. Concurre n tly, it was observed that under identical storage conditions, both HTO12 LNP and SM-102 LNP exhibited sustained and comparable ability of in vivo mRNA delivery ( Fig. S14E and F). This outcome underscores that reducing HTO lipids input does not compromise the stability of the LNP in aqueous solution.",

            "text": "Lipid delivery systems, such as liposomes and lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), have been extensively used in clinics to combat cancer and infectious diseases [112][113][114]. Liposomes are spherical in structure and have a hydrophilic core and one or multiple bilayers of hydrophobic membranes [115]. LNPs can be further categorized into solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN), nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC), lipid drug conjugates (LDC), or polymer-lipid hybrid nanoparticles (PLN). Unlike liposomes, LNPs differ slightly in their individual compositions, as not all LNPs have the continuous bilayer that would qualify them as lipid vesicles or liposomes. \n\nLiposomes have been examined for the delivery of protein antigens for decades. It has been proven that covalent linkage between proteins and liposomes is necessary to induce robust immune responses, as noncovalent protein association (e.g., by chelating) does not produce a product that is stable in vivo [116]. Bale et al. confirmed that noncovalent associations of HIV-1 envelope trimer proteins and liposomes were susceptible to dissoci-ation, while covalent conjugates retained their integrity even after 96 h of incubation at room temperature under in vitro conditions that mimicked the in vivo environment [117]. Although both covalent and noncovalent complexes elicited higher HIV-1 trimer-specific IgG titers in tested animals compared to soluble antigens, covalent HIV-1 trimer-liposome conjugates induced humoral responses to a greater extent compared to their noncovalent counterparts. Notably, mice immunized with covalent conjugates (\u2248150 nm) had threefold higher germinal center responses and twofold higher antigen-specific T follicular helper cell responses compared to mice immunized with soluble antigens [118]. \n\nA variety of other lipidic systems have also been used for protein antigen delivery.",

Using stealth-based nanomaterials is a common strategy for enhancing the stability and prolonging the circulation duration of mRNA molecules [40]. In this context, poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) emerges as the gold standard for nanoparticle formation due to the hydrophilic nature of PEG, low cellular toxicity, and high biocompatibility [41]. The concept of PEGylation encompasses the modification of biological molecules through covalent conjugation with PEG. PEGylation modifies the physical and chemical properties of the mRNA compounds, including their conformation, electrostatic binding, and hydrophobicity [42]. This modification results A few parameters of the PEG-Lipids can be adjusted to improve the encapsulation efficiency. For example, the amount of PEG is inversely proportional to the size of the LNP, hence, the higher the PEG content, the smaller the size of the LNP. A higher molecular weight of PEG and a longer lipid chain can increase the circulation time of the LNPs in the biological system.",

Overall, a strong negative correlation between alkyl side chain length and the size of APE-LNPs was observed for all polymers, demonstrat-ing the critical importance of the APE side chain design for their ability to form nanoparticles with lipid excipients (Figures 3B and S4B). \n\nMoreover, the APE-LNPs composed of HL polymers (AA1-HL-3 and AA4-HL-3) showed limited stability over time compared to DL-based polymers (AA1-DL-3 and AA4-DL-3), increasing in size and polydispersity when stored in PBS (pH 7.4) at 4 \u00b0C for up to 28 days (Figure S6). This data confirm that the APE alkyl side chain length also plays a role in LNP stability, and polymers with short (e.g., C1) or no side chains display limited size stability or tend to form aggregates. 25,29 The surface charge (\u03b6) of APE-LNPs ranged from \u221220 to 10 mV (Figures 3C and S4C ), and a positive correlation was observed between the polymer alkyl side chain length and the \u03b6-potential (Figures 3D and S4D). The mRNA encapsulation efficiency (EE) of the APE-LNPs was between 20 and 95% and also positively correlated with the alkyl side chain length. We hypothesize that APE-LNPs with low EE (<60%) may exhibit a decreased surface charge due to potential interference of the nonencapsulated mRNA. Polymers with side chains containing four or more carbons yielded particles with significantly increased EE (Figures 3E,F and S4E,F).",

It is impossible to know the impact of such alternative forms on the DP efficacy and safety without an analytical method capable of distinguishing ultrahigh molecular weight forms. It is also important that the analytical method preserves the alternative forms during analysis. \n\nThe public assessment reports by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) list the specifications of the Comirnaty (Pfizer-BioNTech) and Spikevax (Moderna) vaccines. 7,8 Metrics include the DP size determination by DLS and purity/integrity determination by reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RP-LC) or CGE. The purity determination method by RP-HPLC typically involves a high column temperature and the use of an ion-pairing agent in combination with an organic solvent. 12 he integrity determination of mRNA by CGE involves the use of high amounts of a denaturing agent, i.e., 4\u22128 M urea or formamide under nonaqueous conditions. 13,14 In both methods, the harsh denaturing conditions used prevent detection of noncovalent aggregates. \n\nThe sizes of mRNA and LNP are usually between 100 and 500 \u00c5 15,16 and between 600 and 1000 \u00c5, 17 respectively. The large size requires the use of SEC columns with ultrawide pores, which pose heightened challenges with regard to column particle stability. The stability of a packed bed strongly depends on the average pore diameter and has to be carefully considered when large pore particles are packed. 18 The Zenix SEC-300 column (300 \u00c5 pore size) and SRT SEC-1000 column (1000 \u00c5 pore size) are indicated for the determination of mRNA aggregates. 14 However, aggregates of mRNA and LNPs would be unlikely to be chromatographically resolved on these columns, given that they are larger than both of these pore sizes.",

Despite the extended refrigeration period, the DMKD-PS LNPs demonstrated minimal size changes, unlike other particles that exhibited significant size alterations. Observing the size of mRNAcaptured LNPs at refrigeration temperature over 16 weeks, DMKD-PS shows consistent size, indicating structural stability. This outcome arises from the strong binding between mRNA and LNPs, which maintains their structural integrity over time. Notably, factors such as particle size and stability are influenced by the binding ratio of nucleic acids to lipid carriers [36], underscoring the importance of this interaction in determining the physical properties of the LNPs. These results demonstrate that DMKD-PS LNPs not only effectively protect mRNA from RNase A degradation but also maintain their stable structures and mRNA protection capability, even after prolonged refrigeration. \n\neffectively protect mRNA from RNase A degradation but also maintain their s structures and mRNA protection capability, even after prolonged refrigeration.",

Ionizable lipids are charged at lower pH ranges with a pKa of about 6 to 7, and uncharged at a physiological pH of about 7.4 e.g. SM-102. The positively charged headgroups of these lipids interact electrostatically with the negatively charged phosphate backbone of the RNA, thus improving the association efficiency of the RNA with the LNP. In the case of ionizable lipids, manufacturing therefore takes places under acidic conditions (pH ~ 4 commonly used in microfluidic systems). In addition, ionizable lipids have the advantage of improving transfection efficiency at least in part to improved endosomal escape. Helper lipids such as cholesterol, DSPC or DOPE influence rigidity and stability, as well as cellular mechanisms such as endocytosis of the LNPs. PEGylated lipids influence many different physiological properties, such as prolonged blood circulation, circulation half-life and in vivo distribution, as well as having an impact on size characteristics, encapsulation efficiency, and LNP aggregation. (Hald Albertsen et al., 2022;Li et al., 2022;Jayesh et al., 2018;De and Ko, 2023) Because of the advantages described above for using lipids and their compositions in developing RNA formulations, we require appropriate analytical methods that can be used in drug development for both the quantification of the respective components and stability studies. We present a reversed-phase high-performance-liquid-chromatography (RP-HPLC) method for quantification of lipids commonly used in RNA LNP formulations. The method is suitable for the simultaneous quantification of cationic and ionizable lipids, as well as for the uncharged helper lipids and PEGylated lipids using a C-18 column for separation. UV quantification of lipids is of limited use, however, the mass-based Charged-Aerosol-Detector (CAD) method is an established means for lipid quantification.",

Drugs encapsulated in the liposome are released to subcellular structures after degradation of the endosome and the liposome by the lysozymes in the endo-lysosomal pathway. \n\nLipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been shown to effectively deliver nucleic acid-based therapeutics to target cells. LNPs can be engineered to include a variety of lipids, including cationic lipids, neutral lipids, and cholesterol, to optimize their stability, encapsulation efficiency, and cellular uptake. Additionally, LNPs can be functionalized with targeting ligands to improve specificity for certain cell types or tissues. Several recent studies have investigated the use of LNPs for delivering gene therapy to treat various diseases. For example, Nance and Hakim [103,104] reported the use of LNPs to deliver CRISPR-Cas9 for the treatment of muscular dystrophy has been demonstrated for the treatment of Duchene's muscular dystrophy [103]. Engineered LNPs with a cationic lipid and PEGylated lipid are used to optimize their stability and cellular uptake. These LNPs In addition to gene therapy, LNPs have also been investigated for delivering gene editing tools, such as CRISPR-Cas9 and base editors. LNPs have been trialed for delivering base editors or a CRISPR-Cas9 system that can delete the BCL11A gene to treat \u03b2 thalassemia and sickle cell disease in human subjects [105]. The result showed a longterm deletion of the deleterious alleles in hematopoietic stem cells can an increase in the expression of foetal haemoglobin can reduce vaso-occlusive events. The use of LNPs for delivering gene therapy and editing has shown promising results in preclinical studies, with potential applications in treating various diseases.",

Specifically, after screening for suitable ionizable cationic lipids and by optimizing the concentration of the synthetic lipid DMG-PEG 2000, we show that the encapsulation, via microfluidic mixing, of adenine base editor and prime editor RNPs within LNPs using the ionizable lipid SM102 can result in in vivo editing-efficiency enhancements larger than 300-fold (with respect to the delivery of the naked RNP) without detectable off-target edits. We believe that chemically defined LNP formulations optimized for RNP-encapsulation stability and delivery efficiency will lead to safer genome editing.",

In particular, it has been consistently shown that most LNPs are sequestered and degraded in lysosomes 12 or removed to extracellular space, 44 significantly limiting their therapeutic effects. 19,34 In addition, it is difficult to target nonhepatic organs with LNPs due to high liver tropism. It was demonstrated that spleen 21,25 and lung endothelium 28,29 can be targeted by modification of LNP formulations. Nonetheless, the use of LNPs with regards to non-hepatic delivery is still limited, and is the area of focus for next generation therapeutics.\n\nTypically, LNPs consist of four lipids: (1) cationic lipid, (2) PEG lipid, (3) cholesterol, and (4) structural lipid. The first component i.e. the cationic lipid is generally composed of a cationic head group and lipid tails, and is located in the core of LNPs with nucleic acids. This component is extensively explored because of its ability to assemble negatively charged nucleic acids into particles via electrostatic forces, and also in causing cytosolic release of nucleic acid by its interactions with the endosomal membrane. 1,10,16,45 The second component is the PEG lipid which possesses a PEG chain anchored to a lipid headgroup.

            "text": "A structurally ionizable lipid is most often a tertiary amine that is deprotonated in a neutral environment and positively charged at pH below the acidity constant (pK a ) of the lipid. Various structures of cationic lipids are known that differ in polar groups (mono-or polycation and linear or heterocyclic) and hydrophobic moieties (cholesterol-based or linear). In the practice of LNP preparation, linear monocationic lipids are used mostly. Ionizable cationic lipids perform key functions in lipid particle systems: first, they effectively bind to negatively charged nucleic-acid residues and encapsulate them into particles; second, they ensure the neutral charge of nanoparticles at physiological pH; and third, they improve endosomal fusion by destabilizing the endosomal membrane when the charge turns positive after endosome acidification (Cheng and Lee, 2016). \n\nCholesterol is the second most abundant lipid (~40 mol%) in LNPs. It performs two main functions: first, it extends effective halflife of LNPs in the bloodstream by diminishing the amount of surface-bound proteins; and second, it ensures preservation of the encapsulated material and its delivery into the cell by altering the rigidity of the particle membrane (Hald et al., 2022). \n\nThe most commonly used phospholipid is 1,2-distearoyl-snglycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC), which has a high melting point (55 \u00b0C), which enables increased circulation time in the body and higher stability of nanoparticles. The addition of 1,2-dioleoyl-snglycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) into nanoparticles improves intracellular delivery. The DOPE molecule is a truncated cone owing to the presence of a double bond in the cis configuration in each alkyl chain and of a small polar group, which allow for the formation of hexagonal layers.",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are essential delivery vehicles in mRNA-based vaccines, with their functionality largely governed by aminolipids. At low pH, protonated aminolipids facilitate efficient mRNA encapsulation, while their deprotonation at physiological pH drives LNP remodeling into a stable spherical structure, potentially aiding mRNA release during endosomal re-protonation and concomitant restructuring at low pH. Our study uncovers the pH-dependent phase transition of the Comirnaty lipid formulation at the molecular scale, highlighting the intricate interplay between lipid reorganization and aminolipid protonation. We observe a substantial shift in the aminolipid pKa, from 7-8 at the LNP surface to below 4 within the hydrophobic LNP core, resulting in an overall apparent pKa of the lipid nanoparticle of 6.3. The pH-dependent protonation significantly affects the aminolipid\u2019s localization, with protonated aminolipids enriched in vicinity of the mRNA and at the LNP surface at neutral pH. The lipid monolayer covering LNPs at neutral pH comprises cholesterol (60\u201365%), helper phospholipids (20\u201325%), PEGylated lipids (5%), and a mix of protonated and deprotonated aminolipids (5\u201310%). These findings provide mechanistic insights into aminolipids behavior in LNPs, offering a foundation for optimizing LNP design to enhance stability, tunable pH responses, and therapeutic efficacy.",

Based on lipid composition and nanostructure, lipid nanocarriers for RNA delivery can be categorized into lipid nanoparticles, liposomes, lipid nanoemulsions, and solid lipid nanoparticles. Among these, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) represent the most advanced technology and have been successfully implemented in clinical settings [161]. Three RNA therapeutics utilizing LNPs as carriers have received marketing approval, including Onpattro (patisiran), Comirnaty (BNT162b2), and Spikevax (mRNA-1273). Onpattro (patisiran), an siRNA drug developed by Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the United States in 2018 for the treatment of peripheral neuropathy in adult patients caused by hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (hATTR). Onpattro is the world's first siRNA drug to be approved by a regulatory agency. Comirnaty (BNT162b2), an mRNA vaccine jointly developed by Pfizer and BioNTech, is used for the prevention of infection by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). At the end of 2020, Comirnaty became one of the first COVID-19 vaccines to obtain emergency use authorization (EUA) worldwide and has subsequently received full approval in multiple countries and regions. Spikevax (mRNA-1273), formerly known as the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine, is an mRNA vaccine developed by Moderna, also for the prevention of infection by the novel coronavirus. It too received emergency use authorization in several countries in late 2020 and received formal approval subsequently. Typically, LNPs comprise four distinct functional components: ionizable cationic lipids, neutral phospholipids (auxiliary phospholipids), cholesterol, and PEGylated lipids [162]. The advancement of ionizable cationic lipids is pivotal for the clinical translation of LNPs.",

Their development has accelerated since the success of Patisiran, the first siRNA-LNP therapeutic, and the mRNA vaccines that emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic. Designing LNPs with specific targeting, high potency, and minimal side effects is crucial for their successful clinical use. However, our understanding of how the composition and mixing method influences the structural, biophysical, and biological properties of the resulting LNPs remains limited, hindering the development of LNPs. Our lack of structural understanding extends from the physical and compositional polydispersity of LNPs, which render traditional characterization methods, such as dynamic light scattering (DLS), unable to accurately quantitate the physicochemical characteristics of LNPs. In this study, we address the challenge of structurally characterizing polydisperse LNP formulations using emerging solution-based biophysical methods that have higher resolution and provide biophysical data beyond size and polydispersity. These techniques include sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation (SV-AUC), field-flow fractionation followed by multi-angle light scattering (FFF-MALS), and size-exclusion chromatography in-line with synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering (SEC-SAXS). Here, we show that the LNPs have intrinsic polydispersity in size, RNA loading, and shape, and that these parameters are dependent on both the formulation technique and lipid composition. Lastly, we demonstrate that these biophysical methods can be employed to predict transfection in human primary T cells, intravenous administration, and intramuscular administration by examining the relationship between mRNA translation and physicochemical characteristics. We envision that employing solution-based biophysical methods will be essential for determining LNP structure-function relationships, facilitating the creation of new design rules for LNPs.",

The hepatic knockdown efficiency of the target genes and liver toxicity were evaluated. The optimal compositions for the siRNA were different from those for ASO, and different from those for mRNA that were reported in a previous study. Extracellular stability, endosomal escape and cellular uptake appear to be the key processes for the successful delivery of mRNA, siRNA and ASO, respectively.

Whether the ionizable surface lipids drive the ''Protein adsorption/uptake\" has not yet been thoroughly investigated but they are likely involved in protein/apoE corona formation on the LNP surface. Note that many structural and biological properties of LNPs should be ascribed not to a single lipid component but rather a combination of lipids, as illustrated above. This is illustrated by all the LNP components that contribute to the structure/morphology of LNPs. The PEG-lipids dictate the LNP size, and thus, influence the ratio of the surface to core distribution of the remaining components, and thereby ultimately their packing motif. The light blue highlight illustrates that PEG-lipids containing a long lipid tail improve the in vivo stability of LNPs.

Naked siRNA degraded rapidly, while siRNA from LNPs retained its structural integrity for up to 4 h (Fig. 5B, C). The Rio-Green assay confirmed that the encapsulation efficiency of siRNA in Si-Sele@LNPs exceeded 94.2%. Compared to unlodeed LNPs, the zeta potential of Si-Sele@LNPs decreased (Fig. 5D) as the encapsulation of si-Sele reduced the relative counts of cations in LNPs. Stability tests revealed that no significant changes happened in the particle size or polydispersity index (PDI) of Si-Sele@LNPs when they were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at pH 6.8 for 1 week (Fig. 5E), suggesting that Si-Sele@ LNPs can maintain their structure in the slightly acidic environment of skin scar tissues. The impact of tensile forces generated during the modeling procedure on LNP structure was examined, and DLS results showed that no significant change happened in the average size of Si-Sele@LNPs after CMS stimulation (Fig. 5F). TEM imaging also confirmed that Si-Sele@LNPs retained their spherical morphology after CMS stimulation (Fig. 5G,  H).",

The majority of studies listed in Table 3 use loaded LNPs prepared with a lipid/nucleic acid charge ratio of 3:1. 180 It has been suggested that the amine/phosphate charge ratio is a key parameter for cargo delivery, where a critical amount of excess amino lipid is necessary for maximum endosome destabilization. Additionally, PEG-lipid surface coverage and dissociation rate have a significant impact on circulation times. 181 RNA-LNP Activity: Structures and Formation Mechanisms. Optimizing production methods for the controlled formulation of LNPs is challenging. From an industrial perspective, samples typically need to exhibit functional and structural reproducibility, long-term stability, scalability, and cost efficiency. Many studies have reported optimization of production methods for laboratory studies to improve the controlled assembly of RNA-loaded LNPs. Particular challenges include control of LNP diameter, encapsulation efficiency morphology, and composition. 145,161,167,181,182 The required diameter of LNP formulations designed for passive targeting will depend on their clinical application.

            "text": "In order to solve the problem that the naked mRNA will be lysed by the lysosome, extensive research has been conducted to develop the protection system which is able to deliver mRNA successfully. Among these, LNP technology has been developed and proven to be efficient in stabilizing mRNA in the cells. \n\nLNP, a lipid nanoparticle, is a lipid vesicle with a homogeneous lipid core. Small molecule and nucleic acid medication delivery are its principal uses. LNP is made up five different kinds of components, and nucleic acid is the main active component among them. The remaining four structural distribution ratios are ionizable cationic lipid (about 50%), cholesterol (about 38.5%), neutral lipid (about 10%), and PEG-lipid (about 1.5%) [12]. The precise structure is displayed in Figure 2. The cholesterol mainly stabilizes the nanoparticle structure and carries out endocytosis mediated by low-density lipoprotein (LDL) structure receptors, and promotes mRNA intracellular uptake and cytosolic entry [13]. PGE-lipid can improve the overall stability and also be used to control the particle size of nanoparticles and prolong the metabolism time of nanoparticles in blood [14]. And the primary component of LNP is the ionizable cationic lipid. The negative charge, hydrophilicity, difficulty passing through the cell membrane, and fragility of bare nucleic acids make it easier for them to be obliterated by around nuclease in the body. So we need a positively charged lipophilic carrier for delivery. Therefore, the ionizable cationic lipid can be electrostatically adsorbed with nucleic acids, and can directly affect the delivery efficiency of mRNA.",

First, there is the chemical identity and stability of the lipid excipients which is described above. Secondly, there is the physical stability of the nanoparticle that can be monitored by measuring particle size, size distribution (polydispersity) and surface charge, using light scattering techniques. Changes to these attributes indicate that there is a disintegration or redistribution of the LNP components. The Onpattro \u00d2 siRNA-LNP product has a shelf-life of 36 months as a liquid formulation stored refrigerated. 13 This profile indicates that particle physical stability is not a major risk when a chemically stable API is used. However, the internal structure of mRNA containing particles is different from those containing siRNA 7 and mRNA-LNP particles are more likely to disintegrate upon mechanical stress, such as shaking and dropping of vials. 91,92 Another example is the formation of layers of aggregates on filter surfaces during sterile filtration. 93 \u221296 Can We Get Rid of the Sub-Zero Cold Chain for Long Term Storage of mRNA-Products?

            "text": "LNPs have been developed in the past years for the in vivo delivery of short-interfering RNAs (siRNA) and messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Recently, they have been tested also for gene editing applications becoming one of the most exploited vehicles for liver targeting, for instance in clinical trials delivering genome editing reagents (Gillmore et al., 2021;Longhurst et al., 2024) (Figure 9D). LNPs are typically composed of four primary elements: phospholipids, cholesterol, polyethylene glycol (PEG) lipids, and ionizable cationic lipids (Kazemian et al., 2022). Phospholipids and cholesterol secure the structural stability of the LNP. PEG lipids have been introduced to coat LNP with PEG molecules to prevent particle aggregation, decrease immunogenicity, and increase the LNP halflife in vivo (Kazemian et al., 2022). Lastly, the use of ionizable cationic lipids has significantly improved the delivery mediated by LNP. Briefly, these lipids are positively charged during LNP production, allowing the interaction and encapsulation of negatively charged nucleic acids. On the other hand, LNPs are in an uncharged state at a neutral pH, such as when they are delivered in vivo, thus preventing immune system reaction. Once LNPs are internalized into target cells by endocytosis, they become positively charged again due to the lowering of the endosomal pH. This provokes the rupture of the endosome membrane enabling the release of the nucleic acids into the cytosol (Paunovska et al., 2022). Up to now, the efficient encapsulation into LNPs is limited to nucleic acids, which remain in the cytosol and cannot access the nucleus, after delivery to target cells. Since the persistence of nucleic acids in the cytosols is limited in time, LNPs allow for transient delivery of their cargo, overcoming the limitation related to the stable expression of the editing agents by viral vectors. Once injected into the bloodstream, LNPs are coated with ApoE lipoproteins that interact with the LDLR.",

            "text": "The present study examined a siRNA-based approach targeting SAT1 expression in GB. While siRNA-based therapeutics have enormous potential for targeted silencing of critical pathways involved in cell signaling and metabolism in cancer [34,35], safe and effective delivery is crucial. In this regard, LNPs have both biocompatibility and loading efficiency as merits for consideration. The lipid composition of the LNPs plays a significant role in determining the drug entrapment efficiency, size, surface charge and blood circulation half-life. Usually, a mixture of lipids is used in LNP formulation to achieve the desired physicochemical and drug loading/delivery properties. We focused on DODAP, DSPC, cholesterol, DSPE-PEG2000 and DiO as the lipid components for our initial formulation trial. DODAP is an ionizing lipid (PKa: 6.6-7) that carries a cationic charge at acidic pH and, therefore, can electrostatically bind to the negatively charged siRNA. Hence, the high encapsulation efficiency (>95%) of siRNA observed in the present study could be attributed to the presence of DODAP in the lipid mix. The LNPs used in the present study also included a PEG lipid component to aid in the optimization of both the size and stability of the LNPs. It has been reported that increasing the PEG lipid composition can reduce the size of the LNPs [36]. While highly hydrophilic nanoparticles smaller than 10 nm in diameter are rapidly cleared from the circulation via extravasation and renal clearance [37], nanoparticles larger than 200 nm in diameter are efficiently removed by the reticuloendothelial system [38]. As our intended target resides within the brain, we postulated that LNP sizes between 60-100 nm in diameter would have the greatest chance for delivery across the BBB when combined with the transient opening of the BBB using cadherin peptides. The incorporation of PEG (1.5%) into the LNP formulation resulted in a LNP of approximately 80 nm in diameter that retained a high siRNA encapsulation efficiency.",

A library of 20 RGD peptide-based ionizable lipids was synthesized by conjugating RGD peptide heads 1-4 to alkyl lipid tails (A, B, C, D, and E) (Fig. 2). 38 These RGD peptide-based ionizable lipids were then used to formulate LNPs and combined in an ethanol phase with three other excipients: (i) cholesterol, to enhance LNP stability and promote membrane fusion, (ii) DOPE, a helper lipid to fortify the bilayer structure of the LNP and promote endosomal escape, and (iii) lipid-anchored polyethylene glycol (C14-PEG2000), to reduce aggregation and nonspeci\ue103c endocytosis (Fig. 1A). 39,40 This ethanol phase was then combined with an aqueous phase containing mRNA using a micro\ue104uidic device to induce chaotic mixing and LNP formulation. The resulting LNP library was characterized using dynamic light scattering (DLS); the diameter of LNPs ranged from 50 to 200 nm and all LNPs had a polydispersity index (PDI) less than 0.3 (Table S1 \u2020). However, the mRNA encapsulation efficiency of these RGD peptide-based LNPs was lower than typically seen, with less than 50% encapsulation for all LNPs in the library.\n\nThese LNPs were formulated with luciferase mRNA as a model cargo to evaluate in vitro mRNA delivery via bioluminescence. Upon intracellular uptake and endosomal escape, luciferase mRNA is translated into luciferase protein which reacts with luciferin reagent to produce bioluminescence as an indicator of functional mRNA delivery. 38 HepG2 cells were selected to evaluate in vitro mRNA delivery as they are a commonly used immortalized cell line for drug metabolism and hepatotoxicity studies.

            "text": "The three LNP-based drugs share multiple similarities in their formulation, and hence, behave similarly as nanoparticles in vivo. Importantly, all LNPs are composed of four types of lipids; ionizable lipid, phospholipid, cholesterol, and PEG-lipid (Fig. 3). All 3 ionizable lipids have tertiary amine group with pKa 6.0e6.7. These lipids switch its charge from neutral to cationic based on the neutral pH in the blood and the acidic pH in endosomes. The 3 PEG-lipids have dialkyl chains 14-carbon long, which are important for the rapid dissociation from the surface of LNPs once inside the body [43]. The biodegradable design of ALC-0315 [44] and SM-102 [11] is described later. \n\nLipid composition of the three drug products is summarized in Table 3. All three LNPs were composed of four lipids in similar molar ratios. The major differences are in the storage condition of drug products. A recent review estimated that mRNAs, not LNPs, are the main factors for low storage stability of drug products, and thus mRNA vaccines need to be supplied at freezing (about \u00c020 C) or ultra-freezing (\u00c080 to \u00c060 C) conditions to slow down mRNA hydrolysis [45]. Sucrose is used as a cryoprotectant to maintain the physical properties of LNPs during freeze-thaw cycles [46]. In contrast to the two mRNA vaccines, Patisiran needs to avoid freezing temperatures, probably because lipid nanoparticles dissolved in PBS, not in Sucrose, cannot tolerate freezing. \n\nIn principal, assembly of LNPs is achieved by rapid mixing of four lipids in ethanol with RNA molecules in an aqueous buffer (near pH 4) in a microfluidic or T-junction mixer [47e49].",

This initial sample was diluted by adding 100 \u00b5L of 0.1% Triton X-100 in DI water. Triton X-100 disrupts the integrity of LNPs, leading to the release of the BSA encapsulated within the LNPs. Subsequently, this diluted sample was further diluted by 60 times the original volume of DI water. Following by Bradford Assay to quantify the BSA content, 200 \u00b5L of Bradford reagent was added to 200 \u00b5L of the diluted sample. The mixture was then incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature. The Bradford assay is based on the formation of a dry-protein complex, with absorbance measured at 595 nm. The concentration of BSA in the LNPs was determined by comparing the absorbance values to a standard curve constructed using known BSA concentrations. The encapsulation efficiency (EE%)  was calculated as the percentage of BSA incorporated compared to the initial BSA concentration available using the following equation: \n\nLoading capacity (LC%) was calculated as the percentage of the mass of BSA-loaded divided by the total mass of the particle component (lyophilized LNPs) using the following equation:",

In this study, we were able to show that these lipids influence LNP efficacy without compromising size and RNA encapsulation, indicating their impact in intracellular delivery of mRNA. The incorporation of DGTS in LNP formulation resulted in variable efficacies depending on experimental conditions: in vitro cell culture, in vivo liver and epithelium. This discrepancy may be due to possible modification of LNP morphology by DGTS that changes the stability and tolerance of LNPs. 8,30 It has already been argued that LNPs may require a reasonable compromise in stability for better transfection, suggesting that high stability is not beneficial for endosomal escape due to inhibition of membrane destabilization. 8 Accordingly, stability of DGTS LNPs could be too high to transfect in vitro, but it could be beneficial for in vivo tolerability. One might also posit that structurally modified LNP surface potentially affects ApoE binding which may be the reason for this variability. ApoE is present at various concentrations depending on tissues. 13,17 If DGTS facilitates the LNP binding to ApoE, DGTS LNPs will be internalized more efficiently in vivo and therefore we would find differential activity based on different tissues. Thus, structural lipids could be an important ingredient for developing tissue specificity. Upon further comparison of DGTS or DSPC as an excipient for inhalable LNPs, we found that the difference in in vitro mRNA transfection between DGTS and DSPC decreased after nebulization (about 50 folds vs. 12 folds), which probably implies advantage of DGTS in LNP tolerability for nebulization. Because loss of nanoparticles during the nebulization blocks delivering nucleic acids to the lungs via inhalation, 11 discovery of novel structural lipids that make LNPs resilient to the use of nebulizer will substantially improve efficacy of gene therapies.\n\nIn summary, these",

LNP-3F also appeared spherical (Supplementary Fig. 1). The z-average R h values of all LNPs, as determined by batch DLS, are below 50 nm irrespective of RNA content (Table 1). \n\nThe four LNP-RNA samples and their corresponding empty LNP samples were analyzed by SEC-MALS with online DLS (SEC-MALS-DLS). Zhang and others [14] showed that the TOSOH TSKgel G6000PWXL-CP column, designed for SEC of water-soluble cationic polymers, is also suitable for the analytical separation of cationic LNPs with average R h between 33 and 70 nm. In our LNP formulations, cationic lipid is the most abundant component and an imaged capillary isoelectric focusing (IC-IEF) study demonstrated that LNPs with similar composition carry positive charge [28]. The average R h values of all LNPs except LNP-4E (25.7 nm) are within the range studied by Zhang and others. All LNP-4E particles were eluted on the Tosoh TSKgel G6000PWXL-CP column before the inclusion volume about 13.2 mL (Supplementary Fig. 2), indicating that this column is also suitable for LNP-4E. Thus, the Tosoh TSKgel G6000PWXL-CP column was selected for SEC separation. Fig. 2 presents the radius (R) values of the four LNP-RNA samples at each eluting data slice as determined by fitting the MALS data to a sphere model, overlaid on the corresponding 90 \u2022 light scattering chromatogram. For the majority portion of each chromatogram the radius decreases with retention time, suggesting that good size-based SEC separation was achieved using the conditions described above. At the tail of each peak a slight increase in radius was observed, opposite to the expected trend.",

The clinical translation of mRNA therapies is limited in part by the need for improved delivery systems 5 ; those which can address challenges associated with mRNA's chemical instability and potential immunogenicity, and limited intracellular delivery 6 . Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been identified as a leading system for siRNA delivery and are now being used with mRNA 7 . To provide a therapeutic effect, LNPs must both deliver functional mRNA to the cytoplasm of target cells, and be tolerated by the patients, to enable repeated administration at therapeutically relevant doses 8 . \n\nLNPs are often formulated with phospholipids, cationic/ ionizable amino lipids, poly(ethylene) glycol (PEG)-lipid, and cholesterol 9 . The cationic/ionizable amino lipids are critical for mRNA transfection, and can be synthesized using rational design approaches to systematically vary the lipid head and tail structures 8,10,11 . Alternatively, combinatorial methods have been used to generate libraries of lipid-like materials and identify nontraditional lipid structures 9 . To improve the endosomal release and cytoplasmic delivery of mRNA, fusogenic lipids such as dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) have been incorporated into the LNPs 12,13 . DOPE tends to form the inverse hexagonal phase (H II ), which destabilizes endosomal membrane and facilitates the release of mRNA 12 . In addition, decreasing the degree of saturation of the hydrophobic tails of the ionizable lipid has also been reported to contribute to forming of H II phase. An increasing number of double bonds corresponds with an increasing propensity to form the non-bilayer phase 12,14,15 . Therefore, linoleic acid derived tails have been incorporated into lipids to achieve an enhanced siRNA/mRNA delivery efficiency 10 . Many of these materials are not biogradable.",

            "text": "Unstable particles and aggregates of LNPs usually show rod-, needle-, or platelet-like shapes due to the polymorphic transition of lipid matrices from the \u03b1-or \u03b2'-form to \u03b2-form 26,27 . However, transmission electronic microscopic (TEM) images showed that LNPs retained a spherical shape, and their size was in accordance with the sizes of 170-184 nm obtained by dynamic light scattering measurements (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Table S1). \n\nDifferential scanning calorimetric (DSC) results were obtained to determine thermal properties of LNPs or of each LNP component (Fig. 1c). As shown in heating-and cooling-calorigrams for aqueous surfactant solutions, surfactants alone without lipids neither melted nor crystallized in the aqueous condition, yielding no change in the calorigrams. The endothermic peak representing melting of \u03b2-form crystals of TS appeared at ~ 70 \u00b0C in the heating-calorigram of the bulk lipid. Endothermic peaks in the heating-calorigrams of LNPs were attributed to the polymorphism of lipids, where peaks at ~ 47 \u00b0C and ~ 56 \u00b0C represented the melting of \u03b1-and \u03b2'-form crystals of TS, respectively. These two peaks typically represent TS melting at the core and outer layer of LNPs which is densely anchored to the high-melting surfactant at the interface. The lowered transition temperature compared with bulk lipid was due to more disordered \u03b1-and \u03b2'-form crystals of the LNPs than the \u03b2-form crystals of the bulk lipid, resulting in the spherical shape of LNPs. While exothermic peaks of bulk lipid were observed at ~ 44 \u00b0C and ~ 35 \u00b0C in cooling-calorigrams, the peaks of LNPs appeared at ~ 18 \u00b0C, which were attributed to crystal imperfections due to the limited space in nanoscale lipid particles. The lowered crystallization temperature compared with bulk lipid indicates the absence of large particles and destabilized LNPs in the dispersion 28 . These results suggest that M-LNP had very good colloidal stability, thus preventing LNP coalescence, flocculation, and aggregation.",

By visualizing how LNPs change under different conditions, researchers can predict the behavior of the vaccine during storage, transport, and after administration, ensuring that the mRNA remains intact and functional throughout the vaccine's lifecycle (Arno et al., 2020;Sebastiani et al., 2021). One prominent example of PyMOL's application in LNP design is the study by Zhang et al. (2023a), which explored LNP formulations for mRNA vaccines. In their work, the researchers used PyMOL to visualize and model the interaction between the lipid components of the LNPs and the encapsulated mRNA (Zhang et al., 2023a). By adjusting lipid compositions and evaluating the resulting structural and functional properties, the team optimized the LNPs to enhance mRNA encapsulation and improve delivery efficiency. The use of PyMOL in this study enabled the team to refine the nanoparticle design, resulting in a more stable and effective LNP for mRNA delivery (Arevalo-Romero et al., 2024).",

            "text": "LNPs are typically composed of four components: ionizable cationic lipids, phospholipids, cholesterol and polyethylene glycol (PEG)-lipids (Fig. 1). LNP formulations used for gene silencing in hepatocytes entrap siRNA at a ratio of 0.095 (w/w, siRNA/lipid) and generate ~50 nm particles with narrow size distributions 64 ; this size is crucial to allowing these particles to pass through the fenestrated liver vasculature 65 . We discuss the following factors that have been critical for clinical translation: ionizable cationic lipid optimization, diffusible PEG-lipid design and a robust, scalable manufacturing process. \n\nThe ionizable lipid shape and acid-dissociation constant optimization dramatically improved LNP potency, thereby enabling clinical translation. Permanently cationic lipids such as DOTMA demonstrated toxicities that hindered rapid translation in vivo 66 . Comparatively, ionizable tertiary amine moieties in the lipid headgroup allowed for a net-positive charge at acidic pH and a neutral charge in circulation; the decreased toxicity and lower immune stimulation suggested improved clinical utility 67,68 . Rational design and iterative screening using the murine factor VII (FVII) model identified DLin\u2212MC3\u2212DMA 60 ; its development has been reviewed elsewhere 69 . Optimizing previous-generation lipids, such as DLin\u2212 DAP, improved the therapeutic index 8,000-fold. \n\nAnother key component in determining LNP\u2212siRNA transfection competency is the PEG-lipid, which was required to prevent aggregation during particle formation 70 . However, PEG-lipids inhibited uptake into target cells and were therefore counter-productive for transfection 71 . To find an optimal balance between stability and transfection competency, diffusible PEG-lipids containing C14 alkyl chains were developed 72,73 . In the presence of a lipid sink, these lipids rapidly dissociate from the LNP, generating transfection-competent systems.",

            "text": "The success of messenger RNA (mRNA) nanoparticles for vaccination against Covid-19 has highlighted the potential of RNA nanomedicines as well as of nano-scaled pharmaceutical products in general [1][2][3][4][5] . In mRNA vaccines, so-called lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), which are characterized by a specific lipid composition and manufacturing process, are used for mRNA delivery. There is a wealth of different other nano-scaled pharmaceuticals which have reached various stages of clinical and preclinical development. The particles may be based on organic (e.g., lipids, polymers, polypeptides, proteins) as well as on inorganic materials (e.g., metals, metal oxides, silica) 6,7 . \n\nThe majority of these products are intended for parenteral application with particle sizes typically below 200 nm (the limit for sterile filtration): LNPs measure 100 nm or less, and certain particle formats (e.g., for targeting tumors or crossing the blood-brain barrier) are in the range of tens of nanometers. With dimensions of a few or few tens of Angstroms, other types of drug formats such as biologics (therapeutic proteins, antibodies) or soluble polymers may be included for this category of nano-sized drugs. The characteristics of all these systems are dominated by their colloidal nature, where particle size and size-related attributes are of fundamental importance for quality, biological efficacy, and safety. \n\nDetermination of size-related parameters, such as internal structure and especially drug loading, poses particular challenges regarding quality control 8 . Obtaining information on size distribution profiles and sizedependent parameters is crucial for the identification of critical quality attributes (CQA) and critical process allowing to obtain the full information from classical, multi-detector AF4 with subsequent in-line SAXS measurements from the same particles (Fig. 1). \n\nWe selected bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a model protein to represent the conditions for analyzing protein products for pharmaceutical applications (biologics), where we regarded the separation capacity from oligomers and aggregates, and compared the quality of the data from the monomer with results from the cuvette and SEC-separated measurements.",

The preliminary screening of the lipids was processed via the preparation of empty LNPs and the measurement of the physicochemical properties and stability. The four components (the disulfide ionizable lipid, cholesterol, 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and PEGylated lipids) were dissolved in ethanol in the molar ratios of 50:38.5:10:1.5, respectively, then, LNPs were prepared by using a microfluidic device as previously demonstrated [27]. The size of the LNPs was in the range of 50~130 nm (Table 1). LNPs obtained from saturated alkyl chain tails were liable to decompose and the storage life was less than 3 days at 4 \u2022 C (Entry 1-7), which is unsuitable for mRNA delivery. Linoleoyl tail is widely exploited in the development of excellent lipids, such as DLin-MC3-DMA, in which there are two double bonds [26]. The degree of unsaturation has been shown to influence mRNA delivery and stability. Next, we tried to use the unsaturated linoleic acid-derived lipid C4S18A (Entry 8) and oleic acid-derived lipid C4S18B (Entry 9) to produce LNPs, and they both showed better stability in comparison with the alkyl counterpart C4S18. C4S18A formulation shows evenly distributed, as identified by polydispersity index (PDI < 0.2); then, using the optimal S18A tail, we screened different hydrophilic heads to optimize the lipids. These LNPs (Entry 10-16) are stable for more than 3 days at 4 \u2022 C. Subsequently, five homogeneous LNP formulations (Entry 8, 10, 11, 14 and 16) were singled out to package the firefly luciferase (Fluc) mRNA with the N/P ratio of 7:1.",

            "text": "msDNA stands out due to its linear, torsion-free configuration, eliminating the supercoiling typical of plasmid DNA. Supercoiled plasmid DNA helps condense the DNA in a crowded cellular environment and often requires unwinding for transcription and replication 23 . However, this supercoiling and unwinding can introduce further torsional forces that can lead to structural vulnerabilities 62 . In contrast, we hypothesize that msDNA's linear form promotes a more relaxed conformation that resists destabilizing forces, including pH fluctuations and mechanical stress, such as sonication. The enhanced stability observed at pH 4, a critical condition for lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulations, is particularly noteworthy. Our results demonstrate significant degradation  S6). of DNA at pH 3 but maintain the structural integrity of msDNA at pH 4, making it a promising candidate for LNP-based delivery systems 63,64 . Typically, LNP formulations, such as those employed in mRNA vaccines, incorporate ionizable lipids that exhibit positive charge at pH levels below their pKa and are uncharged near neutral pH levels 65 . For optimal encapsulation of nucleic acid molecules (whether mRNA or DNA) by LNPs, it is common practice to incubate DNA in low pH buffers (pH 3 or 4) before rapidly mixing with ionizable lipids. Our findings (Figure S2) reveal significant DNA damage at pH 3 following short incubation periods (~ 1 h), strongly recommending the avoidance of such acidic conditions in LNP formulation efforts. Low pH (pH 3) causes DNA damage including depurination 66 that is not easily observed by agarose gel electrophoresis but makes the DNA susceptible to T5-exo activity. Depurination is also a leading cause of mutations 67 and is poorly studied for nucleic acid molecules (RNA or DNA) undergoing the LNP encapsulation process. DNA damage by low pH could also introduce reactive open ends that heighten the risk of generating nicked DNA.",

            "text": "Nonetheless, SLNs' ability for large-scale production and consistent reproducibility is favoring their downstream and clinical applications [23]. NLCs have been developed as a continuation of SLNs to improve the encapsulation efficiency and prevent drug leakage. NLC matrices form amorphous structures that are composed of solid and liquid lipid blends [24]. The larger inter-fatty acid chain distances resulting from the presence of distinct lipid molecules in NLCs create more imperfections (irregularities) for drug accommodation and thus better stability during storage [5]. The higher solubility of drugs in liquid lipids can be used to enhance the drug loading [25]. The development of lipid polymer hybrid nanoparticles represents a new generation of delivery systems that harness the unique characteristics of polymeric nanoparticles and liposomes that were crucial to their early therapeutic success. Additionally, these lipid nanoparticles were designed to overcome drawbacks, such as structural disintegration, a shortened circulation period, and material leakage, that were identified in prior delivery systems [26]. The polymer controls the release of the drug, whereas the lipid enhances drug permeation across the membrane and facilitates loading. Thus, these hybrid nanoparticles made of polymer and lipid can enhance both the physical stability and biocompatibility of drugs, making them a promising option for an effective drug delivery system [27]. The administration of biologic drugs remains a significant challenge because these large molecules often do not conform to Lipinski's \"rule of five\" criteria and are prone to be unstable both in vitro due to aggregation and in vivo due to enzymatic and chemical degradation. Delivering biologics to their intracellular target while avoiding intracellular degradation pathways poses a significant challenge for many of these molecules. The delivery of oligonucleotide has been most effective using LNPs as a carrier [28]. The LNPs have been extensively characterized [29] and Pieter Cullis's [30] research group has reported the use of LNPs as a means of delivering SiRNA, resulting in the product Onpattro \u00ae (developed with Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA), approved by USFDA in August 2018.",

            "text": "Aqueous dispersions of hydrophobic Ag-decanethiol nanoparticles were formed using DPPC and DPPC+DPPS as stabilizing components. Our results based on bilayer phase behavior suggest that the DPPC/AgNP assemblies consisted of nanoparticle-embedded bilayer vesicles. The stability of the assemblies was dependent on their storage temperature and, in turn, the state of the bilayer (gel or fluid phase). Given that the nanoparticles had diameters near or exceeding the thickness of a lipid bilayer, this work suggests that DPPC bilayers can distort to accommodate such particles and that this distortion reduces lipid ordering. This result is consistent with the ability for a cell membrane to accommodate large transmembrane proteins [21]. As a therapeutic agent, LNAs may be formed with functional nanoparticles, potentially larger than previously thought, for combined delivery and imaging. With respect to nanoparticle-cell interactions, these results provide further evidence that such hydrophobic nanoparticles could reside within cell membranes. Studies are underway to measure LNA morphology and structure, develop new nanoparticle encapsulation protocols, and explore different lipid compositions.\n\nSurface plasmon resonance (SPR) of lipid/Ag-decanethiol nanoparticle assemblies as a function of temperature",

            "text": "In this (and next) experiment, the probe was incorporated into lipid nanoparticles (LNP) in 140 mM NaCl\u221210 mM (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid) (HEPES) buffer, pH 7.4, which we have previously found optimal for LNP stability and in vitro experiments. 59 It was excited at 409 nm, and emission was measured at 665 nm on a plate reader (SpectraMax M5, Molecular Devices). When Pyro-PtdEtn-QSY was exposed to PC-PLC, an increase of fluorescence was observed, whereas the other phospholipases did not yield any significant increase in fluorescence (Figure 1). \n\nBecause of the success of the initial enzyme tests, further experiments were conducted to see if the fluorescence of Pyro-PtdEtn-QSY could be restored when exposed to PC-PLC under conditions more closely related to the intended translational use of the probe. Rather than excitation and emission experiments conducted at a single wavelength in a plate reader, we used an IVIS Spectrum imaging system with an excitation filter range of 415\u2212445 nm (430 nm filter) and detected the emission in the 650\u2212670 nm range (660 nm filter). For this, Pyro-PtdEtn-QSY was exposed to a buffered solution (140 mM NaCl\u221210 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, control) and several phospholipase isoforms, as described above. The results of this experiment are evident from Figure 2. Fluorescence is observed almost immediately only when Pyro-PtdEtn-QSY is exposed to PC-PLC. The fluorescence continues to increase with time, whereas the buffered control, PLD, and sPLA 2 (IB porcine) experiments remain quenched even after 6 h. This experiment confirms the conclusions of previous enzyme tests, demonstrating that Pyro-PtdEtn-QSY is successfully quenched until it is exposed to PC-PLC and fluorescence is restored.",

            "text": "A recent study has shown that the ionizable lipid is mainly located inside the core of the lipid nanoparticles and the interaction with mRNA can influence the ionizability of the lipid [18]. \n\nThe stability of the lipid nanoparticles could be lost in different ways, including aggregation, fusion, leakage of encapsulated mRNA or changes in the concentration of components at the surface of the nanoparticles. The consistent z-average diameters and zeta potential means obtained from repeat measurements of mRNA-LNP1 and mRNA-LNP2 summarized in Table 7 confirm that neither aggregation nor fusion are present and that the lipid nanoparticles are stable during the measurement period. Any change in zeta potential values across repeat measurements would suggest that changes in the composition of surface components may be occurring. Repeat measurements are important to perform to ensure that there are no stability issues present Figure 10 summarizes the zeta potential values (in mV) as a function of pH for mRNA-LNP1 and mRNA-LNP2 prepared in 10 mM NaCl. The zeta potential values of both mRNA-LNP1 and mRNA-LNP2 show similar values at both low and high pH values. However, they exhibit different isoelectric points (pI) with mRNA-LNP1 having a pI at pH 5.90, whilst mRNA-LNP2 has a pI at pH 5.21. This difference in the pI values is due to the different ionizable lipids which are present in both lipid nanoparticle samples. The pI values of the two mRNA-LNP samples do not correspond with the pKa values of the different ionizable lipids present in the nanoparticles but does correlate with the lipid to mRNA ratio and are consistent with other observations reported [25]. \n\nPerforming pH titrations is important in understanding how sensitive samples are to changes in pH conditions and how this could influence formulation stability.",

However, research on the effects of storage on their efficacy, safety, and stability is still lacking. Herein, the impact of storage temperature on two types of lipid\u2010based nanocarriers, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) and receptor\u2010targeted nanoparticles (RTNs), loaded with either DNA or messenger RNA (mRNA), is explored and the effects of different cryoprotectants on the stability and efficacy of the formulations are investigated. The medium\u2010term stability of the nanoparticles was evaluated by monitoring their physicochemical characteristics, entrapment and transfection efficiency, every two weeks over one month. It is demonstrated, that the use of cryoprotectants protects nanoparticles against loss of function and degradation in all storage conditions. Moreover, it is shown that the addition of sucrose enables all nanoparticles to remain stable and maintain their efficacy for up to a month when stored at \u221280 \u00b0C, regardless of cargo or type of nanoparticle. DNA\u2010loaded nanoparticles also remain stable in a wider variety of storage conditions than mRNA\u2010loaded ones. Importantly, these novel LNPs show increased GFP expression that can signify their future use in gene therapies, beyond the established role of LNPs in RNA therapeutics.",

            "text": "The current rapid advancement in ribonucleic acid (RNA) therapeutics research depends on innovations in drug delivery, especially the development of a lipid-nanoparticle (LNP)-based system. The conventional LNP formulation typically contains four components, including an ionizable cationic lipid, a phospholipid, cholesterol or a cholesterol derivative, and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-lipid, with each contributing to the formulation\u2019s overall stability and effectiveness. Among these four types of lipids, the phospholipid component is often known to provide structural support for the nanoparticles but is also a class of bioactive molecules with strong cell signaling potential. This study explores the possibility of incorporating some known structurally related bioactive phospholipids as the fifth component of a conventional four-component LNP formulation and assesses the impacts of such an approach on the physicochemical properties and biological functions of the mRNA LNP formulation. We screened a library of mRNA LNP formulations containing 7 different structurally related bioactive phospholipids at molar concentrations of 5%, 15% and 30% in addition to a conventional four-component LNP formulation (base). We observed differences in physicochemical properties between the mRNA LNP formulations that could be attributed to both the types of phospholipids examined and the molar concentrations used. Cryo-EM analysis revealed structural similarity between the Base formulation and the other formulations. We also characterized the protein expression level in HeLa cells and picked up a distinct cytokine panel signature for each formulation in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMCs). Further immunophenotyping analysis showed that most cells that were transfected were CD4+ T cells, and the addition of the different bioactive phospholipids slightly altered cellular tropism. This exploratory study illustrates how adding the bioactive phospholipid can be used to modulate the LNP function, further expanding the design space for RNA LNP formulations and potentiating LNPs for use as RNA therapeutics.",

            "text": "Cholesterol (CHO), as a naturally abundant sterol lipid, is essential in the building blocks of LNPs and maintains the stability of LNP structure.Due to its small molecule size, CHO can fill the cavity within the LNPs, reduce the leakage of the nuclear acids, and increase the integrity of the nanoparticles.The molar ratio of CHO in the LNP formation varies from 20% to 50%, yet its significance in LNP formation and function cannot be dismissed.Completely replacing CHO with an alkyl substitute resulted in morphology and structure change.Patel et al. [57] discovered that without cholesterol insertion, LNP formed a nonlamellar structure and resulted in a low encapsulation efficiency.The changes in morphology not only altered mRNA packing but affected the efficacy of cellular uptake and the intercellular trafficking of LNPs.According to Kawaguchi et al. [58],\n\nthe cellular internalization and protein expression decreased both in vitro and in vivo when the molar percentage of CHO was reduced from 40% to 10%.In addition, at a lower CHO content, the size of LNPs increased from 75.4 nm to 140 nm, and encapsulation efficiency decreased to 65%, causing unstable physicochemical properties of LNPs.Additionally, CHO can be chemically modified to increase the delivery efficiency of LNPs.Hatit et al. [59] discovered and deciphered the importance of nanoparticle stereochemistry in altering and enhancing the endocytic process.They compared different types of hydroxycholesterol and formulated LNPs consisting of pure 20\u03b1-hydroxycholesterol (20\u03b1) and cholesterol mixture containing both 20\u03b1-hydroxycholesterol and 20\u03b2-hydroxycholesterol (20mix).",

Simulations have been used to try and understand the characteristics of the lipid formulation under those conditions, including, in some case, their interactions with the RNA. The complete selfassembly of the LNP, given the relatively large length scales involved, has been considered only rarely (see next section) and most often using coarse-grained representations (Fig. 4). On the other hand, the local molecular structure inside the nanoparticle can also be investigated on a smaller scale involving few hundred lipids typically pre-assembled in a bilayer configuration. \n\nEarly work from Khalid et al. [23] analyzed the selfassembly of short segments of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) with zwitterionic and cationic lipids using a coarse-grained representation [24]. Subsequent work from Corsi et al. [25] demonstrated with a similar approach the possibility of observing the lamellar to inverted hexagonal phase transition in lipid mixtures containing also cationic lipids and dsDNA. \n\nIn one comprehensive work on LNPs, which appeared in combination with experiments, Leung et al.

Exosomes, naturally occurring extracellular vesicles, have emerged as a potential delivery system due to their innate ability to transport mRNA across biological barriers with minimal immune activation [51]. Peptide-based carriers leverage cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) for efficient intracellular delivery and endosomal escape [52].

            "text": "The storage stability of the mRNA-LNPs is an important issue. For mRNA-LNPs to remain functional after storage, the chemical degradation of mRNA and lipids, as well as the physical degradation of LNPs, must be prevented. Chemical degradation can result in mRNAs losing their activity due to hydrolysis, [38] oxidation, and transesterification. [39][40][41] Furthermore lipids can undergo hydrolysis or oxidation.\n\nTo prevent physical degradation, it is recognized that heating and repeated freeze-thaw cycles should be avoided, but the impacts of lipid chemical structures on LNP stability are poorly understood. As microviscosity is related to energy that inhibits the lipids attempting to diffuse freely within LNPs, we have speculated that microviscosity will affect the physical stability of LNPs as well as their physicochemical properties immediately after preparation.\n\nTo investigate these relationships, LNPs were stored at various temperatures (4, 25, or 40\u00b0C) and their physicochemical characteristics were assessed for up to 90 d (Table S3, Supporting Information). As expected, less viscous LNPs such as CL4F 15-1 and CL4F 14-2 gradually increased in particle size and polydispersity and over time, leaked mRNA. To better clarify the impacts of microviscosity on stability, microviscosity was plotted against physicochemical properties after 1 month of storage at 40\u00b0C (Figure 3j-l). The results showed that LNPs with microviscosity below %150 mPa s have poor storage stability. These data suggest that the lipid tail structure determines the properties of LNPs, and thus influences their physical stability.",

            "abstract": "Gene therapy can be defined as incorporation of genetic material, that is, DNA or RNA, in the cellular gene regulation system, either to correct the expression of a malfunctioning gene or to modulate the cellular functions through expression of the newly incorporated gene. Nucleic acids (NAs) to correct/block malfunctioning genes have great therapeutic potential; however, their application is limited by their low cellular uptake, short half-life in vivo, rapid clearance, and quick enzymatic degradation. To circumvent this issue and achieve efficient and targeted gene delivery, numerous vectors have been developed, broadly categorized as viral and nonviral vectors. The viral vectors owing to their naturally evolved transduction properties were initially proposed as potential carriers due to site specificity, but their large clinical application is hindered because of immunogenicity and pathogenicity. These limitations and the advances in the field of nanotechnology have given rise to the development of nanoparticle-DNA delivery systems. Various delivery systems have been developed, each with their own inherent advantages and disadvantages. Modifications of delivery systems, using molecules such as PEG to increase residence time, and the use of cell-targeting peptides have greatly contributed to the efficacy of these delivery systems. Despite the advancements in this research field, there are still challenges and questions to overcome. These include the fate of the nanomaterials in vivo, their long-term side-effects on gene expression and toxicity as well as the conventional methods of ADMETox. Properly designed preclinical and clinical studies need to be undertaken to ensure the development of efficient and safe nanoparticle-DNA formulations. The need for more fundamental research into the understanding of gene function and gene delivery mechanisms inherently limits the development of successful nanoparticle-DNA formulations and so must also continue to evolve. \n \nThe discovery of gene therapy with potential advantages over existing biochemical technologies has proven to be an indispensable tool for elucidating molecular pathways and phenotype/genotype relationships. Because of various limitations attached to the stability of DNA in biological milieu, several parameters are to be taken care of, for the therapeutic success of gene therapy, such as (i) DNA protection, (ii) high transfection efficacy, (iii) reduced toxicity and absence of nonspecific effects, (iv) high potency even at dosage of DNAs, (v) adaptation to various treatment regimens as well as diseases, and (vi) efficient vectors to bypass intracellular and extracellular barriers to reach their target tissue/organ. \n \nIn spite of much research being carried out with the aim to design different types of vectors for DNA delivery, safe and efficient delivery of DNA into target cells or organs still remains a big challenge. The DNA delivery is a multistep process where a series of extra- and intracellular barriers have to be bypassed for successful application and could be achieved with efficient vectors. For a vector to be an efficient delivery vehicle, it should consist of three different functional moieties: (i) a cationic polymer or lipid component to condense DNA and form complexes, which facilitates their endosomal escape after cellular uptake and facilitates effective unpacking of the complexes in the cytoplasmic compartment; (ii) a hydrophilic component, such as PEG, to impart solubility and stability to the complexes in the biological environment; (iii) a ligand that is specific for the target cell/tissue for enhanced target ability to impart more efficient cellular uptake by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Further, differences in angiogenesis and metastasis between cancerous and normal cells can be exploited to engineer nanoparticle-DNA complexes to be employed to target tumour cells and, henceforth, for designing target-specific vectors. With nanoparticle-DNA complexes gaining successful applications, polymeric nanoparticles are rapidly emerging as DNA delivery systems both in vitro and in vivo. A review of the literature suggests that polymeric nanoparticles can be used to deliver functional DNA to the target cells. Various tumour models have also been used to conduct studies with nanoparticles to deliver DNA for antitumour treatments. A large number of successful animal model studies, including systemic delivery to nonhuman primates, provide excitement and enthusiasm for upcoming research in the field but still a number of hurdles and concerns must be overridden before DNA delivery could be harnessed as a new therapeutic modality. \n \nFor nanoparticles to be designated as an ideal DNA carrier system, the nanoparticles must possess long circulation time, low immunogenicity, good biocompatibility, selective targeting, and efficient penetration to barriers such as the vascular endothelium and the blood brain barrier, self-regulating release without clinical side effects. The successful implication of DNA complexes in clinical applications requires exhaustive details pertaining to efficacy and pharmacokinetics of DNA-vector systems. There is still a huge amount of effort required in preparation of better polymers and in the development of better ways of encapsulating or complexing DNA with them. In this era of developing genetic therapeutics, there is a call for the collaborative work by academicians and industry groups in order to develop methods for preparation of more stable polymeric nanoparticles/DNA complexes and robust analytical methods to characterize formulations during formation and storage. \n \n \nSurendra Nimesh \n \nSabina Halappanavar \n \nNagendra K.

            "text": "Gene therapy can be defined as incorporation of genetic material, that is, DNA or RNA, in the cellular gene regulation system, either to correct the expression of a malfunctioning gene or to modulate the cellular functions through expression of the newly incorporated gene. Nucleic acids (NAs) to correct/block malfunctioning genes have great therapeutic potential; however, their application is limited by their low cellular uptake, short half-life in vivo, rapid clearance, and quick enzymatic degradation. To circumvent this issue and achieve efficient and targeted gene delivery, numerous vectors have been developed, broadly categorized as viral and nonviral vectors. The viral vectors owing to their naturally evolved transduction properties were initially proposed as potential carriers due to site specificity, but their large clinical application is hindered because of immunogenicity and pathogenicity. These limitations and the advances in the field of nanotechnology have given rise to the development of nanoparticle-DNA delivery systems. Various delivery systems have been developed, each with their own inherent advantages and disadvantages. Modifications of delivery systems, using molecules such as PEG to increase residence time, and the use of cell-targeting peptides have greatly contributed to the efficacy of these delivery systems. Despite the advancements in this research field, there are still challenges and questions to overcome. These include the fate of the nanomaterials in vivo, their long-term side-effects on gene expression and toxicity as well as the conventional methods of ADMETox. Properly designed preclinical and clinical studies need to be undertaken to ensure the development of efficient and safe nanoparticle-DNA formulations. The need for more fundamental research into the understanding of gene function and gene delivery mechanisms inherently limits the development of successful nanoparticle-DNA formulations and so must also continue to evolve. \n \nThe discovery of gene therapy with potential advantages over existing biochemical technologies has proven to be an indispensable tool for elucidating molecular pathways and phenotype/genotype relationships. Because of various limitations attached to the stability of DNA in biological milieu, several parameters are to be taken care of, for the therapeutic success of gene therapy, such as (i) DNA protection, (ii) high transfection efficacy, (iii) reduced toxicity and absence of nonspecific effects, (iv) high potency even at dosage of DNAs, (v) adaptation to various treatment regimens as well as diseases, and (vi) efficient vectors to bypass intracellular and extracellular barriers to reach their target tissue/organ. \n \nIn spite of much research being carried out with the aim to design different types of vectors for DNA delivery, safe and efficient delivery of DNA into target cells or organs still remains a big challenge. The DNA delivery is a multistep process where a series of extra- and intracellular barriers have to be bypassed for successful application and could be achieved with efficient vectors. For a vector to be an efficient delivery vehicle, it should consist of three different functional moieties: (i) a cationic polymer or lipid component to condense DNA and form complexes, which facilitates their endosomal escape after cellular uptake and facilitates effective unpacking of the complexes in the cytoplasmic compartment; (ii) a hydrophilic component, such as PEG, to impart solubility and stability to the complexes in the biological environment; (iii) a ligand that is specific for the target cell/tissue for enhanced target ability to impart more efficient cellular uptake by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Further, differences in angiogenesis and metastasis between cancerous and normal cells can be exploited to engineer nanoparticle-DNA complexes to be employed to target tumour cells and, henceforth, for designing target-specific vectors. With nanoparticle-DNA complexes gaining successful applications, polymeric nanoparticles are rapidly emerging as DNA delivery systems both in vitro and in vivo. A review of the literature suggests that polymeric nanoparticles can be used to deliver functional DNA to the target cells. Various tumour models have also been used to conduct studies with nanoparticles to deliver DNA for antitumour treatments. A large number of successful animal model studies, including systemic delivery to nonhuman primates, provide excitement and enthusiasm for upcoming research in the field but still a number of hurdles and concerns must be overridden before DNA delivery could be harnessed as a new therapeutic modality. \n \nFor nanoparticles to be designated as an ideal DNA carrier system, the nanoparticles must possess long circulation time, low immunogenicity, good biocompatibility, selective targeting, and efficient penetration to barriers such as the vascular endothelium and the blood brain barrier, self-regulating release without clinical side effects. The successful implication of DNA complexes in clinical applications requires exhaustive details pertaining to efficacy and pharmacokinetics of DNA-vector systems. There is still a huge amount of effort required in preparation of better polymers and in the development of better ways of encapsulating or complexing DNA with them. In this era of developing genetic therapeutics, there is a call for the collaborative work by academicians and industry groups in order to develop methods for preparation of more stable polymeric nanoparticles/DNA complexes and robust analytical methods to characterize formulations during formation and storage. \n \n \nSurendra Nimesh \n \nSabina Halappanavar \n \nNagendra K.

Peroxide values and conjugated diene methods determine the primary oxidative products of lipid oxidation and are commonly used for plant oils and high-fat products. 2-Thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances and chromatographic methods are used to determine the secondary products of oxidation and are suitable for meat and meat-based products.

Microfluidics offers considerable advantages for their manufacture due to its scalability, reproducibility and fast preparation. Thus, in this study, we have evaluated operating and formulation parameters to be considered when developing LNPs. Among them, the flow rate ratio (FRR) and the total flow rate (TFR) have been shown to significantly influence the physicochemical characteristics of the produced particles. In particular, increasing the TFR or increasing the FRR decreased the particle size. The amino lipid choice (cationic\u2014DOTAP and DDAB; ionisable\u2014MC3), buffer choice (citrate buffer pH 6 or TRIS pH 7.4) and type of nucleic acid payload (PolyA, ssDNA or mRNA) have also been shown to have an impact on the characteristics of these LNPs. LNPs were shown to have a high (>90%) loading in all cases and were below 100 nm with a low polydispersity index (\u22640.25).

                "text": "\nLipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have emerged as one of the most successful delivery systems for nucleic acid therapeutics, most notably demonstrated in the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. These sophisticated nanostructures typically consist of four key lipid components: ionizable cationic lipids that complex with the negatively charged nucleic acids, helper phospholipids that provide structural stability, cholesterol that aids in membrane organization, and PEGylated lipids that offer steric stabilization and extended circulation time. LNPs protect their sensitive cargo (such as mRNA) from degradation in the biological environment and facilitate cellular uptake and endosomal escape, allowing the therapeutic payload to reach its site of action. The integrity and stability of LNPs are paramount to their efficacy and safety, as changes in their structure, size, or composition can dramatically affect their biodistribution, cellular uptake, and ultimately the therapeutic outcome. Therefore, a comprehensive suite of biochemical analytical tools is essential to characterize and monitor these critical quality attributes throughout development, manufacturing, and storage. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">",

                            "In the recent of years, the use of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for RNA delivery has gained considerable attention, with a large number in the clinical pipeline as vaccine candidates or to treat a wide range of diseases. Microfluidics offers considerable advantages for their manufacture due to its scalability, reproducibility and fast preparation. Thus, in this study, we have evaluated operating and formulation parameters to be considered when developing LNPs. Among them, the flow rate ratio (FRR) and the total flow rate (TFR) have been shown to significantly influence the physicochemical characteristics of the produced particles. In particular, increasing the TFR or increasing the FRR decreased the particle size. The amino lipid choice (cationic\u2014DOTAP and DDAB; ionisable\u2014MC3), buffer choice (citrate buffer pH 6 or TRIS pH 7.4) and type of nucleic acid payload (PolyA, ssDNA or mRNA) have also been shown to have an impact on the characteristics of these LNPs. LNPs were shown to have a high (>90%) loading in all cases and were below 100 nm with a low polydispersity index (\u22640.25). The results within this paper could be used as a guide for the development and scalable manufacture of LNP systems using microfluidics."

Significant progress in the development, production, and characterization of nucleic acid nanomaterials and nucleic acid nanoparticles (NANPs), as well as abundant proof-of-concept data, are paving the way toward biomedical applications of these materials. This recent progress has catalyzed the development of new strategies for biosensing, imaging, drug delivery, and immunotherapies with previously unrecognized opportunities and identified some barriers that may impede the broader clinical translation of NANP technologies. A recent workshop sponsored by the Kavli Foundation and the Materials Research Society discussed the future directions and current challenges for the development of therapeutic nucleic acid nanotechnology. Herein, we communicate discussions on the opportunities, barriers, and strategies for realizing the clinical grand challenge of TNA nanotechnology, with a focus on ways to overcome barriers to advance NANPs to the clinic."

However, characterizing these complex and unstable products remains challenging. Developing fast, reliable methods to assess critical quality attributes (CQAs) of the mRNA component is crucial for ensuring the safety and efficacy of these medicines. Currently, evaluating key CQAs, such as mRNA integrity and encapsulation efficiency, often involves a labor-intensive manual extraction protocol, which requires LNP disruption prior to analysis. However, these additional offline steps contribute to mRNA degradation and measurement uncertainties, highlighting the urgent need for rapid and effective methods capable of performing an online LNP disruption. Hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) might offer a promising solution to address this need."

However, GC-FID is rather laborious involving derivatization and is not able to analyze high molecular weight components. LC-MS is expensive and difficult for high sample throughput, and is better suited for investigational purposes instead of routine testing. Finally, ELSD does not provide sufficient sensitivity for impurity detection. \n\nCharged aerosol detection has become increasingly popular in the pharmaceutical industry due to its ability to detect analytes lacking chromophores that have low vapor pressure [13]. Previously at Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA, a UHPLC coupled with charged aerosol detector (CAD) method was developed and used for lipid analysis for small interfering RNA (siRNA) LNP studies [14]. The CAD's high sensitivity makes it an ideal choice over the ELSD."

                            "Lipid oxidation is the most crucial quality parameter in foods. Many methods were developed to determine the level of oxidation and antioxidant activity. This review compares the methods used to determine lipid oxidation and antioxidant capacity in foods. Lipid oxidation methods developed are based on the direct or indirect measurement of produced primary or secondary oxidation substances. Peroxide values and conjugated diene methods determine the primary oxidative products of lipid oxidation and are commonly used for plant oils and high-fat products. 2-Thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances and chromatographic methods are used to determine the secondary products of oxidation and are suitable for meat and meat-based products. The fluorometric and sensory analyses are indirect methods. The antioxidant capacity of additives is determined indirectly using the lipid oxidation methods mentioned above or directly based on the free-radical scavenging activity of the antioxidant compounds. Each lipid oxidation and antioxidant capacity methods use different approaches, and one method cannot be used for all foods. Therefore, selecting proper methods for specific foods is essential for accurately evaluating lipid oxidation or antioxidant capacity."

                "text": "\nThe limitations of current analytical methods for LNP characterization have driven the development of more sophisticated approaches aimed at preserving sample integrity while providing comprehensive data on multiple quality attributes. Hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) represents one of the most promising emerging technologies in this space, offering the capability to perform online LNP disruption and simultaneous analysis of mRNA integrity, thereby minimizing the sample degradation issues associated with conventional manual extraction protocols. <Paper corpusId=\"277462761\" paperTitle=\"(Maurer et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nBeyond HILIC, the field is advancing toward integrated analytical platforms that can simultaneously assess multiple CQAs without extensive sample preparation. These include automated systems that combine size and zeta potential measurements with spectroscopic techniques for payload quantification and integrity assessment. The industry is also developing real-time monitoring tools that can be integrated into manufacturing processes, allowing for continuous quality verification rather than end-point testing.\n\nAnother significant trend is the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to analyze complex analytical data sets from LNP characterization. These computational approaches can identify subtle patterns and correlations between manufacturing parameters and final product attributes that might not be apparent through conventional data analysis.\n\nAdvanced imaging techniques, including cryo-electron microscopy and super-resolution microscopy, are increasingly being employed to visualize LNP structural details and payload distribution within nanoparticles. These techniques provide valuable insights into the relationship between LNP structure and function that complement the quantitative data obtained from chromatographic and spectroscopic methods.\n\nThe development of these innovative analytical approaches reflects the industry's recognition that ensuring LNP integrity and stability requires comprehensive, non-destructive assessment methods. As LNP-based therapeutics continue to expand beyond vaccines into areas such as protein replacement therapy and gene editing, these advanced analytical tools will play an increasingly critical role in their development and quality control. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">",
