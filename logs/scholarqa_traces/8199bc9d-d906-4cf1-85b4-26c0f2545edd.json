With a focus on the science, technological advances, precautions required along with the potential limitations in application, the ethics, guidance\u2019s, and legislative advances that are required to reach the safe and efficacious clinical application of xenotransplantation. Along with a view over the past several decades with the overall significant advancements in pre-clinical study outcomes particularly in islet, kidney, and heart xenotransplantation, to ultimately reach the pinnacle of successful clinical heart and kidney xenotransplants. It outlines the importance for the appropriate guidance\u2019s required to have been developed by experts, scientists, clinicians, and other players who helped develop the field over the past decades. It also touches upon patient advocacy along with perspectives and expectations of patients, along with public opinion and media influence on the understanding and perception of xenotransplantation. It discusses the legislative environment in different jurisdictions which are reviewed in line with current clinical practices. All of which are ultimately based upon the guidance\u2019s developed from a strong long-term collaboration between the International Xenotransplantation Association, the World Health Organisation and The Transplantation Society; each having constantly undertaken consultation and outreach to help develop best practice for clinical xenotransplantation application. These clearly helped forge the legislative frameworks required along with harmonization and standardization of regulations which are detailed here. Also, in relation to the significant advances in the context of initial xeno-kidney trials and the even greater potential for clinical xeno-islet trials to commence we discuss the significant advantages of xenotransplantation and the ultimate benefit to our patients.",

With this we must ensure that the same endemic issues do not occur with xenotransplantation that have occurred with human organ transplantation such as xenotransplant tourism (5) and unethical processes used to make profits at the expense of the animals used and the patients that may be misled into undertaking unapproved procedures (6). \n\nHistorically, xenotransplantation has faced significant challenges, including the perceived/potential for the transmission of diseases from animals to humans (xenozoonosis) (7), concerns over animal welfare (when breeding and producing the donor animals) (8), cultural and religious issues particularly the notion of crossing species boundaries in the use of their tissues for transplantation (6). These challenges led to the imposition of strict regulations along with embargos and a nuanced ethical debate that continues to shape the direction of the field. In recent years, ground-breaking advancements in genetic engineering has rapidly accelerated the field which offers new hope, massively advancing the creation of genetically modified pigs with organs engineered for compatibility with the human immune system (9). These developments have paved the way for the initiation of trials in humans involving xeno-hearts approved under \"compassionate use\" for live patients (10) along with xeno-hearts and kidneys being studied clinically in a new model using \"Brain Dead\" recipients (11,12) along with very successful preclinical trials using transgenic pig islet cells (13). \n\nIn this review, we explore the ethical and legislative advances that are underpinning xenotransplantation as it moves toward broadly accepted clinical translation. We delve into the ethical considerations surrounding xenotransplantation, examining questions related to the potential risks of xenozoonotic disease transmission, animal rights, their use, and the public's perception of this innovative medical approach. We also survey the changes in legislative frameworks governing xenotransplantation, charting their evolution over time, and highlighting the necessity of harmonization and standardisation in regulations worldwide.",

A number of the core areas of ethical concern that have been central to the discourse surrounding xenotransplantation are: the potential for xenozoonosis, public and regulatory issues, crossing of species boundaries and ensuring appropriate animal ethics. However, these must be balanced against the absolute positive gains for the overwhelming number of potential patients that can benefit from xenotransplantation when there are so many medical, financial and social issues for these patients. As can be seen in Figure 2, the balance between the negative aspects of their disease versus receiving a cure from the transplant is overwhelmingly weighted to the positive. This is because the benefits far outweigh the problems of ongoing and increasing ill health, secondary complications, invalidity and ultimately death. However, there are not enough human donor organs available for transplantation and using this single example, the case of patients suffering from type 1 diabetes, there are innumerable patients that could benefit from islet cell xenotransplantation with it being life changing and lifesaving. A concise timeline of some of the major developments that have occurred in the field of xenotransplantation. From the first recorded attempt of a xeno-blood transfusion to the current advent of successful clinical xenotransplants of transgenic pig organs to humans.",

It is incumbent on the broader scientific community and policymakers to communicate the steps taken to mitigate ethical concerns and to provide evidence of the rigorous ethical oversight and animal welfare standards applied in xenotransplantation research. Furthermore the governing organization of xenotransplantation the IXA is maintaining its mission to promote xenotransplantation as a safe, ethical, and effective therapeutic modality by; fostering the science of xenotransplantation through promotion of ethical clinical and pre-clinical research, productive discourse, and collaboration; along with further educating health care providers and lay persons through broad, representative participation interactive public debate; and also guiding the development of scientifically sound, internationally consistent public policy that is responsive to new developments in the field and acknowledges varying social, ethical and legal frameworks (37). Along with ongoing engagement with regulatory bodies and other agencies to ensure they balance the advancement of science but safeguarding the ethical principles. This is actively being undertaken with a strong push from the IXA to engage numerous agencies globally to ensure this continues to occur and keep pace with the rapidly developing technologies (8).",

                    "text": "One ethical concern intrinsic to xenotransplantation relates to the potential for the transmission of diseases from animals to humans, a phenomenon known as xenozoonosis. The concept of transmission although theoretical is not unfounded, as various pathogens, including retroviruses, have been identified in pigs could be potential threats in immunocompromised transplant recipients and then theoretically spread to direct close contacts and the broader community (24,25). \n\nAs such this raises potential ethical dilemmas. The duty to protect the broader community and prevent the spread of theoretically potential infectious diseases must be weighed against the need to explore novel medical solutions to help these patients suffering from end stage organ failure and other diseases (6). The possibility of creating animals free from such pathogens as porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERV) through genetic engineering (26) has already been shown to be possible along with raising donor animals in designated pathogen free (DPF) facilities. Along with pigs that have limited pathogens including restricted PERV (27) or where studies have shown no potential for transmission (28, 29). Despite best intensions and even following screening of donor animals we have seen that donor pig organs can still potentially have undetectable porcine viruses such as cytomegalovirus or porcine roseolovirus (PCMV/PRV) detected posttransplant in the donor tissue by plasma microbial cell-free DNA (30). This occurred despite pre-transplant screening and following transplantation into a patient (25). \n\nFrom a patient and community perspective it is therefore essential for the patients, their family and immediate direct contacts along with the community to understand that if there were in fact a positive case of transmission of a xenozoonosis into a xenotransplant patient that there may well be serious implications to all involved. These implications are potentially as severe as lifelong restriction and quarantine of the recipient and may extend to their direct close contacts (25).",

                    "text": "Jaboulay used the vascular technique to transplant a pig kidney onto the brachial artery and cephalic vein of a 48-yr-old woman. Immediately and for the first day and a half he saw significant urine output, but on the third day, he was forced to remove the kidney because of vascular thrombosis (17). Sadly, a lack of understanding of immunology, hematology and any of the intricacies of transplantation, let alone the issues of cross-species xenotransplantation prevented any chance of longerterm success. These early attempts were characterized by a lack of ethical and scientific groundwork, and the risks and consequences of such procedures were often not well understood. \n\nThe ensuing centuries saw sporadic and largely unsuccessful attempts at xenotransplantation, with frequent instances of graft rejection and infections that further tempered enthusiasm for the field (18-20). Moreover, as medical ethics evolved and animal welfare concerns gained prominence, the scientific community was challenged to grapple with the significant ethical implications of these procedures, especially when it came to the use of animals involved in the pre-clinical trials and as a source of organs, tissues and cells for transplantation into humans (6). \n\nIn the latter half of the 20th century, with the advent of organ transplantation and the increasing demand for donor organs, the potential of xenotransplantation was revisited with renewed enthusiasm pushing the field forward. The discovery of alpha Gal as the mechanism responsible for causing hyperacute rejection (HAR) (21) and the concept of utilizing specifically designed genetically modified pigs (9,13,22), capable of providing organs less immunogenic to the human immune system, marked a significant turning point in xenotransplantation's history. These developments paved the way for the initiation of initial clinical trials involving xeno-kidneys and soon to be islet cell xenotransplants. \n\nAs we explore the ethical and legislative advances propelling xenotransplantation toward clinical translation, we must acknowledge the lessons of history. The historical backdrop of early, less-informed attempts, coupled with ethical concerns, has played an instrumental role in shaping the ethical and legislative frameworks we see today (23).",

It poses profound philosophical and ethical questions about the nature of different species and the moral obligation we owe to different species. As we engage in practices that involve genetic modification and the use of animals for human benefit, the ethical boundaries are changing with increasing pressure on ethics committees and legislators to keep track with the pace of change, and we have a moral imperative to ensure that we do keep pace and provide adequate oversight (6). \n\nSome ethicists argue that xenotransplantation exemplifies the Anthropocentric approach (38), emphasizing human interests over those of animals, while others advocate for a more inclusive biocentric perspective that values all forms of life equally (39). The challenge is to find a balance between medical innovation and ethical responsibility to both animal and man (6).",

                    "text": "Xenotransplantation, the latest frontier in transplantation is the process of retrieving organs, tissues or cells from one species and transplanting them into another. It has long been heralded as the ultimate solution to the overwhelming shortage of human organs available for transplantation (1). The concept of utilizing nonhuman organ and tissue sources to meet the overwhelming demand on conventional donors has captured the attention of clinicians, scientists, healthcare providers, and patients alike for many decades but has also been a concept for hundreds of years (Figure 1). As can be seen in Figure 1, which is a timeline of some of the major landmarks in the journey of xenotransplantation. The first published attempts of xenotransplantation occurred with xenotransfusion occurring in the 1600's then in the 1800's xeno-skin transplants were attempted prior to more ambitious attempts at kidney xenotransplantation. There has been a long line of endeavor as advancements in medical science and technology have brought the prospect of xenotransplantation closer to reality. Importantly the ethical and legislative landscape surrounding this pioneering field has undertaken renewed and ever-increasing attention but still requires ongoing updates (2)(3)(4). A large effort from the International Xenotransplantation Association (IXA) in conjunction with others such as the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Transplantation Society (TTS) have been constantly undertaken, however as the field progresses more needs to be done from a broader international and national regulatory perspective. \n\nXenotransplantation offers us the potential to save countless lives by providing a readily available supply of organs, tissues and cells, significantly reducing the waiting time for transplants, and alleviating the suffering of patients on transplant wait lists. It is also a major means by which we can actively abolish the trade in trafficked organs and organ transplant tourism. However, with this promise comes a complex web of ethical considerations and legal frameworks that must be carefully navigated to ensure the responsible and ethical translation of xenotransplantation from the laboratory to the clinic.",

                    "text": "Xenotransplantation necessitates the use of animals as organ donors. Pigs being primarily used due to their physiological compatibility with humans, their ability to be bred in large numbers at a rapid rate, and their ability to be readily genetically altered. This along with their longstanding acceptance as a source of medical products such as drugs and heart valves and other decellularized tissues. With by far the strongest reason being there acceptance as a major food supply and source of products for man for as long as they have been domesticated should ensure their ease of use ethically (6). However, the welfare of these animals is of paramount concern. As some organizations push the principal that pigs are not merely commodities but sentient beings with the capacity to experience pain and suffering. \n\nThe major issues raised are to ensure the donor pigs are being ethically and humanely cared for and ensure the process of genetic manipulation does not cause them any health issues. One could argue that the facilities and conditions that these animals are housed and the care they receive is of a superior level to a normal commercial piggery due to the highly controlled and run facilities including the need for donor animals to be in DPF facilities. Underpinning this is the fact that all animal research projects including the breeding of, care and handling of the animals are undertaken in strict compliance under animal ethics legislation and under scrutiny of ethics committees (6). The genetic modifications required for these donor animals have been carefully designed to ensure they do not affect the health of the source pigs at all. Therefor from an ethical standpoint the level of suffering could be perceived as minimal or negligible. On the other hand, the potential benefit for patients is very high, being lifesaving and life changing (6). \n\nThere are also the ethical concerns for pre-clinical study recipients the various animals used and especially the non-humanprimates (NHP) which are the benchmark for preclinical trials. Their use is highly recommended prior to acceptance of any program moving to the clinic, and has been advised in many guidance's such as the \"Changsha Communique\" that recommend their use to provide safe and efficacious treatment regimen and modalities prior to commencement of any clinical trials (4).",

Hawthorne\n## Abstract\nIn this state-of-the-art review we detail the journey of xenotransplantation from its infancy, detailing one of the first published cases and the subsequent journey the field took in its inception and development. With a focus on the science, technological advances, precautions required along with the potential limitations in application, the ethics, guidance\u2019s, and legislative advances that are required to reach the safe and efficacious clinical application of xenotransplantation. Along with a view over the past several decades with the overall significant advancements in pre-clinical study outcomes particularly in islet, kidney, and heart xenotransplantation, to ultimately reach the pinnacle of successful clinical heart and kidney xenotransplants. It outlines the importance for the appropriate guidance\u2019s required to have been developed by experts, scientists, clinicians, and other players who helped develop the field over the past decades. It also touches upon patient advocacy along with perspectives and expectations of patients, along with public opinion and media influence on the understanding and perception of xenotransplantation. It discusses the legislative environment in different jurisdictions which are reviewed in line with current clinical practices. All of which are ultimately based upon the guidance\u2019s developed from a strong long-term collaboration between the International Xenotransplantation Association, the World Health Organisation and The Transplantation Society; each having constantly undertaken consultation and outreach to help develop best practice for clinical xenotransplantation application. These clearly helped forge the legislative frameworks required along with harmonization and standardization of regulations which are detailed here. Also, in relation to the significant advances in the context of initial xeno-kidney trials and the even greater potential for clinical xeno-islet trials to commence we discuss the significant advantages of xenotransplantation and the ultimate benefit to our patients.\n## Introduction\nXenotransplantation, the latest frontier in transplantation is the process of retrieving organs, tissues or cells from one species and transplanting them into another. It has long been heralded as the ultimate solution to the overwhelming shortage of human organs available for transplantation (1). The concept of utilizing nonhuman organ and tissue sources to meet the overwhelming demand on conventional donors has captured the attention of clinicians, scientists, healthcare providers, and patients alike for many decades but has also been a concept for hundreds of years (Figure 1). As can be seen in Figure 1, which is a timeline of some of the major landmarks in the journey of xenotransplantation. The first published attempts of xenotransplantation occurred with xenotransfusion occurring in the 1600's then in the 1800's xeno-skin transplants were attempted prior to more ambitious attempts at kidney xenotransplantation. There has been a long line of endeavor as advancements in medical science and technology have brought the prospect of xenotransplantation closer to reality. Importantly the ethical and legislative landscape surrounding this pioneering field has undertaken renewed and ever-increasing attention but still requires ongoing updates (2)(3)(4). A large effort from the International Xenotransplantation Association (IXA) in conjunction with others such as the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Transplantation Society (TTS) have been constantly undertaken, however as the field progresses more needs to be done from a broader international and national regulatory perspective. \n\nXenotransplantation offers us the potential to save countless lives by providing a readily available supply of organs, tissues and cells, significantly reducing the waiting time for transplants, and alleviating the suffering of patients on transplant wait lists. It is also a major means by which we can actively abolish the trade in trafficked organs and organ transplant tourism. However, with this promise comes a complex web of ethical considerations and legal frameworks that must be carefully navigated to ensure the responsible and ethical translation of xenotransplantation from the laboratory to the clinic.\n...\nHowever, with this promise comes a complex web of ethical considerations and legal frameworks that must be carefully navigated to ensure the responsible and ethical translation of xenotransplantation from the laboratory to the clinic. With this we must ensure that the same endemic issues do not occur with xenotransplantation that have occurred with human organ transplantation such as xenotransplant tourism (5) and unethical processes used to make profits at the expense of the animals used and the patients that may be misled into undertaking unapproved procedures (6). \n\nHistorically, xenotransplantation has faced significant challenges, including the perceived/potential for the transmission of diseases from animals to humans (xenozoonosis) (7), concerns over animal welfare (when breeding and producing the donor animals) (8), cultural and religious issues particularly the notion of crossing species boundaries in the use of their tissues for transplantation (6). These challenges led to the imposition of strict regulations along with embargos and a nuanced ethical debate that continues to shape the direction of the field. In recent years, ground-breaking advancements in genetic engineering has rapidly accelerated the field which offers new hope, massively advancing the creation of genetically modified pigs with organs engineered for compatibility with the human immune system (9). These developments have paved the way for the initiation of trials in humans involving xeno-hearts approved under \"compassionate use\" for live patients (10) along with xeno-hearts and kidneys being studied clinically in a new model using \"Brain Dead\" recipients (11,12) along with very successful preclinical trials using transgenic pig islet cells (13). \n\nIn this review, we explore the ethical and legislative advances that are underpinning xenotransplantation as it moves toward broadly accepted clinical translation. We delve into the ethical considerations surrounding xenotransplantation, examining questions related to the potential risks of xenozoonotic disease transmission, animal rights, their use, and the public's perception of this innovative medical approach. We also survey the changes in legislative frameworks governing xenotransplantation, charting their evolution over time, and highlighting the necessity of harmonization and standardisation in regulations worldwide.\n\n## Historical perspective\nJaboulay used the vascular technique to transplant a pig kidney onto the brachial artery and cephalic vein of a 48-yr-old woman. Immediately and for the first day and a half he saw significant urine output, but on the third day, he was forced to remove the kidney because of vascular thrombosis (17). Sadly, a lack of understanding of immunology, hematology and any of the intricacies of transplantation, let alone the issues of cross-species xenotransplantation prevented any chance of longerterm success. These early attempts were characterized by a lack of ethical and scientific groundwork, and the risks and consequences of such procedures were often not well understood. \n\nThe ensuing centuries saw sporadic and largely unsuccessful attempts at xenotransplantation, with frequent instances of graft rejection and infections that further tempered enthusiasm for the field (18-20). Moreover, as medical ethics evolved and animal welfare concerns gained prominence, the scientific community was challenged to grapple with the significant ethical implications of these procedures, especially when it came to the use of animals involved in the pre-clinical trials and as a source of organs, tissues and cells for transplantation into humans (6). \n\nIn the latter half of the 20th century, with the advent of organ transplantation and the increasing demand for donor organs, the potential of xenotransplantation was revisited with renewed enthusiasm pushing the field forward. The discovery of alpha Gal as the mechanism responsible for causing hyperacute rejection (HAR) (21) and the concept of utilizing specifically designed genetically modified pigs (9,13,22), capable of providing organs less immunogenic to the human immune system, marked a significant turning point in xenotransplantation's history. These developments paved the way for the initiation of initial clinical trials involving xeno-kidneys and soon to be islet cell xenotransplants. \n\nAs we explore the ethical and legislative advances propelling xenotransplantation toward clinical translation, we must acknowledge the lessons of history. The historical backdrop of early, less-informed attempts, coupled with ethical concerns, has played an instrumental role in shaping the ethical and legislative frameworks we see today (23).\n\n## Major ethical considerations\nThe remarkable potential of xenotransplantation to address the critical shortage of human organs has been met with considerable ethical scrutiny, raising profound questions and dilemmas that must be thoughtfully addressed. A number of the core areas of ethical concern that have been central to the discourse surrounding xenotransplantation are: the potential for xenozoonosis, public and regulatory issues, crossing of species boundaries and ensuring appropriate animal ethics. However, these must be balanced against the absolute positive gains for the overwhelming number of potential patients that can benefit from xenotransplantation when there are so many medical, financial and social issues for these patients. As can be seen in Figure 2, the balance between the negative aspects of their disease versus receiving a cure from the transplant is overwhelmingly weighted to the positive. This is because the benefits far outweigh the problems of ongoing and increasing ill health, secondary complications, invalidity and ultimately death. However, there are not enough human donor organs available for transplantation and using this single example, the case of patients suffering from type 1 diabetes, there are innumerable patients that could benefit from islet cell xenotransplantation with it being life changing and lifesaving. A concise timeline of some of the major developments that have occurred in the field of xenotransplantation. From the first recorded attempt of a xeno-blood transfusion to the current advent of successful clinical xenotransplants of transgenic pig organs to humans.\n\n## Potential xenozoonosis\nOne ethical concern intrinsic to xenotransplantation relates to the potential for the transmission of diseases from animals to humans, a phenomenon known as xenozoonosis. The concept of transmission although theoretical is not unfounded, as various pathogens, including retroviruses, have been identified in pigs could be potential threats in immunocompromised transplant recipients and then theoretically spread to direct close contacts and the broader community (24,25). \n\nAs such this raises potential ethical dilemmas. The duty to protect the broader community and prevent the spread of theoretically potential infectious diseases must be weighed against the need to explore novel medical solutions to help these patients suffering from end stage organ failure and other diseases (6). The possibility of creating animals free from such pathogens as porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERV) through genetic engineering (26) has already been shown to be possible along with raising donor animals in designated pathogen free (DPF) facilities. Along with pigs that have limited pathogens including restricted PERV (27) or where studies have shown no potential for transmission (28, 29). Despite best intensions and even following screening of donor animals we have seen that donor pig organs can still potentially have undetectable porcine viruses such as cytomegalovirus or porcine roseolovirus (PCMV/PRV) detected posttransplant in the donor tissue by plasma microbial cell-free DNA (30). This occurred despite pre-transplant screening and following transplantation into a patient (25). \n\nFrom a patient and community perspective it is therefore essential for the patients, their family and immediate direct contacts along with the community to understand that if there were in fact a positive case of transmission of a xenozoonosis into a xenotransplant patient that there may well be serious implications to all involved. These implications are potentially as severe as lifelong restriction and quarantine of the recipient and may extend to their direct close contacts (25).\n\n## Public and regulatory support\nAddressing these ethical concerns is not only a moral imperative but also crucial for gaining public and regulatory support for xenotransplantation. Public perception of the ethics surrounding xenotransplantation can significantly influence its acceptance and, consequently, the regulatory environment. As such there has been significant engagement with both societal and religious organizations to ensure robust understanding of the key concepts and garner opinion and support (6,35,36). \n\nThe IXA has endeavored to undertake public engagement with ongoing dialogue which are essential to fostering trust with transparency and acceptance. It is incumbent on the broader scientific community and policymakers to communicate the steps taken to mitigate ethical concerns and to provide evidence of the rigorous ethical oversight and animal welfare standards applied in xenotransplantation research. Furthermore the governing organization of xenotransplantation the IXA is maintaining its mission to promote xenotransplantation as a safe, ethical, and effective therapeutic modality by; fostering the science of xenotransplantation through promotion of ethical clinical and pre-clinical research, productive discourse, and collaboration; along with further educating health care providers and lay persons through broad, representative participation interactive public debate; and also guiding the development of scientifically sound, internationally consistent public policy that is responsive to new developments in the field and acknowledges varying social, ethical and legal frameworks (37). Along with ongoing engagement with regulatory bodies and other agencies to ensure they balance the advancement of science but safeguarding the ethical principles. This is actively being undertaken with a strong push from the IXA to engage numerous agencies globally to ensure this continues to occur and keep pace with the rapidly developing technologies (8).\n\n## Crossing species boundaries\nXenotransplantation challenges the traditional conceptual boundaries that separate humans from animals. It poses profound philosophical and ethical questions about the nature of different species and the moral obligation we owe to different species. As we engage in practices that involve genetic modification and the use of animals for human benefit, the ethical boundaries are changing with increasing pressure on ethics committees and legislators to keep track with the pace of change, and we have a moral imperative to ensure that we do keep pace and provide adequate oversight (6). \n\nSome ethicists argue that xenotransplantation exemplifies the Anthropocentric approach (38), emphasizing human interests over those of animals, while others advocate for a more inclusive biocentric perspective that values all forms of life equally (39). The challenge is to find a balance between medical innovation and ethical responsibility to both animal and man (6).\n\n## Animal welfare\nXenotransplantation necessitates the use of animals as organ donors. Pigs being primarily used due to their physiological compatibility with humans, their ability to be bred in large numbers at a rapid rate, and their ability to be readily genetically altered. This along with their longstanding acceptance as a source of medical products such as drugs and heart valves and other decellularized tissues. With by far the strongest reason being there acceptance as a major food supply and source of products for man for as long as they have been domesticated should ensure their ease of use ethically (6). However, the welfare of these animals is of paramount concern. As some organizations push the principal that pigs are not merely commodities but sentient beings with the capacity to experience pain and suffering. \n\nThe major issues raised are to ensure the donor pigs are being ethically and humanely cared for and ensure the process of genetic manipulation does not cause them any health issues. One could argue that the facilities and conditions that these animals are housed and the care they receive is of a superior level to a normal commercial piggery due to the highly controlled and run facilities including the need for donor animals to be in DPF facilities. Underpinning this is the fact that all animal research projects including the breeding of, care and handling of the animals are undertaken in strict compliance under animal ethics legislation and under scrutiny of ethics committees (6). The genetic modifications required for these donor animals have been carefully designed to ensure they do not affect the health of the source pigs at all. Therefor from an ethical standpoint the level of suffering could be perceived as minimal or negligible. On the other hand, the potential benefit for patients is very high, being lifesaving and life changing (6). \n\nThere are also the ethical concerns for pre-clinical study recipients the various animals used and especially the non-humanprimates (NHP) which are the benchmark for preclinical trials. Their use is highly recommended prior to acceptance of any program moving to the clinic, and has been advised in many guidance's such as the \"Changsha Communique\" that recommend their use to provide safe and efficacious treatment regimen and modalities prior to commencement of any clinical trials (4).\n\n## Evolution of legislative frameworks\nThe legislative landscape for xenotransplantation has evolved significantly over the years. As science has advanced, the regulations have been adapted to keep pace with the changing landscape in transplantation but it still lacks the oversight and ability to completely control all that occurs. Despite the best policies and guidance's more universal legislation is required to outlaw and prevent organ trafficking and ongoing issues associated with unscrupulous operators (44). The early years of xenotransplantation were characterized by limited regulatory oversight and fragmented approaches to the management of potential risks due to limited legislation to this new field. However, significant oversight was established early on by the WHO, TTS and IXA to ensure there were guidance's developed to underpin the field (2-4). \n\nHowever, high-profile setbacks and scientific developments have prompted a revaluation of regulatory frameworks. An example of this was the identification of porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) which raised concerns by government legislators about the potential transmission of these retroviruses to immunocompromised transplant recipients (45). As a result, several jurisdictions-initiated moratorium preventing any clinical xenotransplantation trials from commencing and as such a stronger focus was placed on the assessment and management of this risk in regulatory guidelines (46). \n\nRecently, regulatory bodies have intensified their efforts to provide comprehensive guidelines for xenotransplantation, reflecting a growing recognition of the field's incredible potential with a balance against the risks. Some guidance's such as from the USA FDA have addressed issues such as genetic modifications in source animals, monitoring for infectious agents, and the ethical treatment of donor animals (42). And the USA government and other jurisdictions legislating and licensing biological products such as xenografts, tissues and cells under specific biological products legislation (47).\n\n## Establishing common standards and guidelines\nInternational collaboration in xenotransplantation research also enables the establishment of common standards, guidelines, and best practices. As the field progresses, consensus on regulatory, ethical, and scientific parameters becomes increasingly vital. Such harmonization streamlines the path from research to clinical application. \n\nCommon standards ensure that xenotransplantation research adheres to shared principles, such as animal welfare, patient safety, and ethical practices. International cooperation allows for the identification of gaps and discrepancies in current regulatory frameworks, enabling the development of more comprehensive and universally applicable guidelines such as the \"Changsha Communique\" (4). \n\nGlobal collaboration in xenotransplantation research is not merely a choice but a By pooling resources, knowledge, and expertise from diverse regions, the field can progress with a unified vision. International cooperation helps establish common standards and guidelines, facilitating the responsible and ethical advancement of xenotransplantation and its translation to clinical reality (31) along with ensuring the registries are supported to be able to capture and report on the fields clinical efforts (69).\n\n## Conclusion\nThe journey of xenotransplantation, the transplantation of organs or tissues from one species to another, has witnessed significant advancements and encountered ethical, legislative, and scientific challenges. This review has delved into various facets of xenotransplantation, emphasizing its potential to address the critical organ shortage crisis while highlighting the essential elements required for its responsible and successful translation to clinical reality.\n\n## Take home messages 9.1.1 Ethical and legislative advances\nThe historical context, ethical considerations, and legislative frameworks have been pivotal in shaping the path of xenotransplantation. From early attempts at cross-species transplantation to the contemporary emphasis on animal welfare and informed consent, the field has evolved significantly.\n\n## Continuing ethical and legislative advancements\nEthical and legislative advancements are indispensable as xenotransplantation moves closer to clinical translation. The responsible treatment of animals, transparent informed consent, and comprehensive regulatory frameworks are fundamental to ensuring ethical and safe practices.",

Thanks to it, it became possible to study the functions and mechanisms of biology with greater precision, as well as to obtain genetically modified organisms, both prokaryotic and eukaryotic. The changes introduced by the CRISPR/Cas system are based on the repair paths of the single or double strand DNA breaks that cause insertions, deletions, or precise integrations of donor DNA. These changes are crucial for many fields of science, one of which is the use of animals (pigs) as a reservoir of tissues and organs for xenotransplantation into humans. Non-genetically modified animals cannot be used to save human life and health due to acute immunological reactions resulting from the phylogenetic distance of these two species. This review is intended to collect and summarize the advantages as well as achievements of the CRISPR/Cas system in pig-to-human xenotransplantation research. In addition, it demonstrates barriers and limitations that require careful evaluation before attempting to experiment with this technology.",

                    "text": "Despite the many advantages of xenotransplantation, there are some ethical, legal, and social aspects that must be regulated and considered. First, there are no international legal regulations for pig-to-human xenotransplantation [139]. Their establishment is one of the major milestones in the introduction of pig-to-human xenotransplantation. Apart from the lack of legal regulations, introducing xenotransplantation into clinical practice requires a discussion in the society combined with explanation of procedures and knowledge bases. There are concerns that some societies will oppose pig-to-human xenotransplantation because of religious and cultural aspects [140]. Moreover, there is a probability that the use of organs from modified pigs, in some countries, may lead to a global trend of reducing the number of human transplants for altruistic reasons [141]. At this moment, we are unable to predict the reaction of society to a person carrying an animal organ. The social acceptance and the fear of social rejection may pose a risk of a medical procedure refusal by patient. Therefore, there is a need for xenograft recipient anonymity. \n\nThe ethical aspects of xenotransplantation mainly concern the use of animals, namely pigs. Harvesting organs from these animals and transplanting them into humans will in most cases result in the death of the animal. Moreover, another aspect concerns the welfare of animals bred for xenotransplantation. These animals are likely to be kept in sterile, laboratory-like conditions. From a human standpoint, the level of care provided to these animals will be the highest. However, when we change to the animal perspective, these conditions may be worse than in agricultural breeding. This type of approach is anthropocentric and puts human life above that of other animal species [142]. For this reason, it is imperative to investigate all alternatives that could replace animal organs and save patients' lives before introducing pig-to-human xenotransplantation into clinical practice [143]. These alternatives so far include, but are not limited to, the use of stem cells and tissue engineering [144]. Thus far, no alternative has been found that would be able to fully replace the functionality of the human organ.",

Hryhorowicz, J. Zeyland, D. Lipinski, R. S\u0142omski\n## Abstract\nCRISPR/Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats linked to Cas nuclease) technology has revolutionized many aspects of genetic engineering research. Thanks to it, it became possible to study the functions and mechanisms of biology with greater precision, as well as to obtain genetically modified organisms, both prokaryotic and eukaryotic. The changes introduced by the CRISPR/Cas system are based on the repair paths of the single or double strand DNA breaks that cause insertions, deletions, or precise integrations of donor DNA. These changes are crucial for many fields of science, one of which is the use of animals (pigs) as a reservoir of tissues and organs for xenotransplantation into humans. Non-genetically modified animals cannot be used to save human life and health due to acute immunological reactions resulting from the phylogenetic distance of these two species. This review is intended to collect and summarize the advantages as well as achievements of the CRISPR/Cas system in pig-to-human xenotransplantation research. In addition, it demonstrates barriers and limitations that require careful evaluation before attempting to experiment with this technology.\n## Legal, Social and Ethical Concerns\nDespite the many advantages of xenotransplantation, there are some ethical, legal, and social aspects that must be regulated and considered. First, there are no international legal regulations for pig-to-human xenotransplantation [139]. Their establishment is one of the major milestones in the introduction of pig-to-human xenotransplantation. Apart from the lack of legal regulations, introducing xenotransplantation into clinical practice requires a discussion in the society combined with explanation of procedures and knowledge bases. There are concerns that some societies will oppose pig-to-human xenotransplantation because of religious and cultural aspects [140]. Moreover, there is a probability that the use of organs from modified pigs, in some countries, may lead to a global trend of reducing the number of human transplants for altruistic reasons [141]. At this moment, we are unable to predict the reaction of society to a person carrying an animal organ. The social acceptance and the fear of social rejection may pose a risk of a medical procedure refusal by patient. Therefore, there is a need for xenograft recipient anonymity. \n\nThe ethical aspects of xenotransplantation mainly concern the use of animals, namely pigs. Harvesting organs from these animals and transplanting them into humans will in most cases result in the death of the animal. Moreover, another aspect concerns the welfare of animals bred for xenotransplantation. These animals are likely to be kept in sterile, laboratory-like conditions. From a human standpoint, the level of care provided to these animals will be the highest. However, when we change to the animal perspective, these conditions may be worse than in agricultural breeding. This type of approach is anthropocentric and puts human life above that of other animal species [142]. For this reason, it is imperative to investigate all alternatives that could replace animal organs and save patients' lives before introducing pig-to-human xenotransplantation into clinical practice [143]. These alternatives so far include, but are not limited to, the use of stem cells and tissue engineering [144]. Thus far, no alternative has been found that would be able to fully replace the functionality of the human organ.",

            "abstract": "Xenotransplantation is emerging as a vital solution to the critical shortage of organs available for transplantation, significantly propelled by advancements in genetic engineering and the development of sophisticated immunosuppressive treatments. Specifically, the transplantation of kidneys from genetically engineered pigs into human patients has made significant progress, offering a potential clinical solution to the shortage of human kidney supply. Recent trials involving the transplantation of these modified porcine kidneys into deceased human bodies have underscored the practicality of this approach, advancing the field towards potential clinical applications. However, numerous challenges remain, especially in the domains of identifying suitable donor-recipient matches and formulating effective immunosuppressive protocols crucial for transplant success. Critical to advancing xenotransplantation into clinical settings are the nuanced considerations of anesthesia and surgical practices required for these complex procedures. The precise genetic modification of porcine kidneys marks a significant leap in addressing the biological and immunological hurdles that have traditionally challenged xenotransplantation. Yet, the success of these transplants hinges on the process of meticulously matching these organs with human recipients, which demands thorough understanding of immunological compatibility, the risk of organ rejection, and the prevention of zoonotic disease transmission. In parallel, the development and optimization of immunosuppressive protocols are imperative to mitigate rejection risks while minimizing side effects, necessitating innovative approaches in both pharmacology and clinical practices. Furthermore, the post-operative care of recipients, encompassing vigilant monitoring for signs of organ rejection, infectious disease surveillance, and psychological support, is crucial for ensuring post-transplant life quality. This comprehensive care highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary approach involving transplant surgeons, anesthesiologists, immunologists, infectiologists and psychiatrists. The integration of anesthesia and surgical expertise is particularly vital, ensuring the best possible outcomes of those patients undergoing these novel transplants, through safe procedural practices. As xenotransplantation moving closer to clinical reality, establishing consensus guidelines on various aspects, including donor-recipient selection, immunosuppression, as well as surgical and anesthetic management of these transplants, is essential. Addressing these challenges through rigorous research and collective collaboration will be the key, not only to navigate the ethical, medical, and logistical complexities of introducing kidney xenotransplantation into mainstream clinical practice, but also itself marks a new era in organ transplantation.",

This meticulous genetic engineering aims to produce organs that are not only less likely to be rejected but also capable of performing their physiological functions without inducing harmful side effects in the recipient. \n\nThe continuous exploration and refinement of these genetic modifications underscore the complexity of making xenotransplantation a viable clinical option. As researchers dive deeper into the genetic underpinnings of immune rejection and organ compatibility, xenotransplantation alleviating the organ shortage crisis is coming true. Yet, it is essential to balance the enthusiasm for these technological advances with a careful assessment of their long-term implications for both organ recipients and the broader field of transplantation medicine. \n\nFuture research must also address the ethical considerations and regulatory challenges associated with xenotransplantation. As genetic engineering techniques become more sophisticated, consensus of the moral, ethical, and societal implications of using genetically modified animals for organ transplantation must be reached. Those topics warranting immediate attention includes animal welfare, the potential impact on natural ecosystems, and the long-term health outcomes for transplant recipients. Moreover, as the field progresses towards potential clinical applications, establishing clear and comprehensive regulatory frameworks will be crucial to ensuring the safety, efficacy, and ethical integrity of organ xenotransplantation. \n\nWhile the genetic engineering of pigs for kidney xenotransplantation represents a frontier of medical science with the potential to dramatically expand the organ donor pool, it also poses a myriad of scientific, ethical, and regulatory challenges.",

Nevertheless, both preclinical and clinical investigations conducted thorough pathogen screening to exclude prevalent viruses in pig donors, such as PERV-3 and PCMV. The posttransplantation virus detection in the decedents also remained negative (12,27) However, the limitations of these negative findings are underscored by the relatively short observation periods.

The pilot xenotransplantation trials have underscored various ethical and medicolegal considerations inherent in xenotransplantation research (12,18). In these studies, brain-dead decedents were precluded from organ donation, and obtaining proper informed consent from their families was deemed essential. Notably, the absence of specific legislation governing xenotransplantation necessitates evolution of the regulatory frameworks to enhance research protocols and future clinical applications.

Specifically, the transplantation of kidneys from genetically engineered pigs into human patients has made significant progress, offering a potential clinical solution to the shortage of human kidney supply. Recent trials involving the transplantation of these modified porcine kidneys into deceased human bodies have underscored the practicality of this approach, advancing the field towards potential clinical applications. However, numerous challenges remain, especially in the domains of identifying suitable donor-recipient matches and formulating effective immunosuppressive protocols crucial for transplant success. Critical to advancing xenotransplantation into clinical settings are the nuanced considerations of anesthesia and surgical practices required for these complex procedures. The precise genetic modification of porcine kidneys marks a significant leap in addressing the biological and immunological hurdles that have traditionally challenged xenotransplantation. Yet, the success of these transplants hinges on the process of meticulously matching these organs with human recipients, which demands thorough understanding of immunological compatibility, the risk of organ rejection, and the prevention of zoonotic disease transmission. In parallel, the development and optimization of immunosuppressive protocols are imperative to mitigate rejection risks while minimizing side effects, necessitating innovative approaches in both pharmacology and clinical practices. Furthermore, the post-operative care of recipients, encompassing vigilant monitoring for signs of organ rejection, infectious disease surveillance, and psychological support, is crucial for ensuring post-transplant life quality. This comprehensive care highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary approach involving transplant surgeons, anesthesiologists, immunologists, infectiologists and psychiatrists. The integration of anesthesia and surgical expertise is particularly vital, ensuring the best possible outcomes of those patients undergoing these novel transplants, through safe procedural practices. As xenotransplantation moving closer to clinical reality, establishing consensus guidelines on various aspects, including donor-recipient selection, immunosuppression, as well as surgical and anesthetic management of these transplants, is essential. Addressing these challenges through rigorous research and collective collaboration will be the key, not only to navigate the ethical, medical, and logistical complexities of introducing kidney xenotransplantation into mainstream clinical practice, but also itself marks a new era in organ transplantation.\n## Introduction\nThe journey toward the clinical application of porcine-to-human kidney transplants is fraught with uncertainties, necessitating rigorous investigation and ethical deliberation. \n\nThe exploration of xenotransplantation, as a viable source of kidneys for transplantation, is gaining momentum, underpinned by the pressing need to address the organ shortage crisis. This approach not only promises to expand the donor pool but also to pioneer new frontiers in transplantation medicine (4). Advances in genetic modification techniques aim to enhance organ compatibility and reduce the likelihood of rejection and cross-species infection, marking a significant leap towards making xenotransplantation a reality for patients in need (4). \n\nMoreover, the field of xenotransplantation is evolving alongside considerations of ethical standards and regulatory frameworks, ensuring that the development and potential clinical implementation are conducted with the utmost care for safety and ethical integrity. As the scientific community continues to unravel the complexities of xenogeneic organ transplantation, the collective goal remains clear: to provide a sustainable, ethical solution to the organ shortage crisis, ultimately saving more lives through innovative medical breakthroughs (5). \n\nIn essence, the path forward in xenotransplantation research and its prospective clinical application is laden with challenges yet brimming with potential. Through continued interdisciplinary collaboration, rigorous ethical scrutiny, and innovative scientific inquiry, xenotransplantation holds the promise of significantly impacting the future of organ transplantation, offering hope to countless individuals awaiting life-saving transplants.\n\n## Donor selection in kidney transplantation\nThese include genes for human complement regulatory proteins (hCD46 and hCD55), which help protect the transplanted organ from the recipient's immune system, and genes like human thrombomodulin (hTBM) and human endothelial protein C receptor (hEPCR), which work to prevent clotting and improve graft survival (6-11) (Figure 1). \n\nResearch institutions, such as the University of Alabama, have made significant strides by utilizing pigs with a comprehensive suite of genetic modifications, including enhancements to immune regulation and coagulation profiles, as well as the removal of specific antigens known to trigger rejection (12). This meticulous genetic engineering aims to produce organs that are not only less likely to be rejected but also capable of performing their physiological functions without inducing harmful side effects in the recipient. \n\nThe continuous exploration and refinement of these genetic modifications underscore the complexity of making xenotransplantation a viable clinical option. As researchers dive deeper into the genetic underpinnings of immune rejection and organ compatibility, xenotransplantation alleviating the organ shortage crisis is coming true. Yet, it is essential to balance the enthusiasm for these technological advances with a careful assessment of their long-term implications for both organ recipients and the broader field of transplantation medicine. \n\nFuture research must also address the ethical considerations and regulatory challenges associated with xenotransplantation. As genetic engineering techniques become more sophisticated, consensus of the moral, ethical, and societal implications of using genetically modified animals for organ transplantation must be reached. Those topics warranting immediate attention includes animal welfare, the potential impact on natural ecosystems, and the long-term health outcomes for transplant recipients. Moreover, as the field progresses towards potential clinical applications, establishing clear and comprehensive regulatory frameworks will be crucial to ensuring the safety, efficacy, and ethical integrity of organ xenotransplantation. \n\nWhile the genetic engineering of pigs for kidney xenotransplantation represents a frontier of medical science with the potential to dramatically expand the organ donor pool, it also poses a myriad of scientific, ethical, and regulatory challenges.\n...\nWhile the genetic engineering of pigs for kidney xenotransplantation represents a frontier of medical science with the potential to dramatically expand the organ donor pool, it also poses a myriad of scientific, ethical, and regulatory challenges. Navigating these complexities will require concerted efforts from researchers, ethicists, and policymakers, with the ultimate goal of making xenotransplantation a safe, ethical, and effective solution for the millions worldwide in need of life-saving organ transplants.\n\n## Challenges in kidney xenotransplantation\nThe common complications include coagulopathy, stemming from endothelial damage and acute rejection, further complicate the post-transplant scenario, necessitating ongoing research and development of strategies to mitigate these effects. \n\nViral infections, particularly those associated with porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERV) and porcine cytomegalovirus (PCMV/PRV), pose significant risks for xenotransplantation. Nevertheless, both preclinical and clinical investigations conducted thorough pathogen screening to exclude prevalent viruses in pig donors, such as PERV-3 and PCMV. The posttransplantation virus detection in the decedents also remained negative (12,27) However, the limitations of these negative findings are underscored by the relatively short observation periods. Consequently, developing future strategies to detect and eliminate these viruses is imperative to uphold the safety of both the graft and the recipient (28). \n\nAdditionally, the ethical landscape of xenotransplantation, encompassing animal rights, public attitudes, and regulatory milestones such as the FDA's 2022 approval of a pig-to-human heart transplant, presents ongoing challenges (29). The pilot xenotransplantation trials have underscored various ethical and medicolegal considerations inherent in xenotransplantation research (12,18). In these studies, brain-dead decedents were precluded from organ donation, and obtaining proper informed consent from their families was deemed essential. Notably, the absence of specific legislation governing xenotransplantation necessitates evolution of the regulatory frameworks to enhance research protocols and future clinical applications. Consultation with ethics committees is imperative to ensure adherence to established guidelines such as the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act (UAGA) and the dead-donor rule, while also acknowledging the cultural and religious nuances surrounding organ transplantation (30). Public acceptance and ethical considerations remain integral to the advancement and clinical application of xenotransplantation, highlighting the need for continued research, dialogue, and education in this evolving field. \n\nIn summary, xenotransplantation's journey towards becoming a viable clinical option is fraught with complex immunological, physiological, virological, and ethical challenges.",

                    "text": "Xenotransplantation is fraught with numerous ethical and social dilemmas, encompassing substantial costs and resource allocations essential for the research endeavor. Questions abound regarding the potential benefits of this scientific pursuit, along with lingering concerns regarding animal rights, animal welfare, and the genetic manipulation of animals designed for human consumption. Additionally, there is a pervasive apprehension surrounding the prospect of xenozoonosis, adding a layer of complexity to the ethical discourse surrounding this innovative field [6,43,61]. \n\nThe advantages of cXT are evident, particularly in light of the extensive waiting list for donors coupled with the scarcity of donor organs [9,62]. However, its true efficacy emerges when the long-term outcomes approach those of allotransplantation [6]. The application of GM techniques has been instrumental in bridging the gap between species, as demonstrated by the extension of survival time without rejection in humans with genetically modified pig hearts, reaching an impressive additional two months [35,36]. These successes underscore the potential for cXT to evolve into a pivotal solution for the organ transplant shortage. Looking ahead, the remarkable progress in genetic technology, coupled with the support of artificial intelligence (AI), holds the promise of further elevating cardiac transplantation [63][64][65]. This trajectory suggests a future where the shortage of organs for transplant may be effectively addressed through the continued refinement of genetic techniques and the integration of advanced technologies. \n\nAnimal rights activists contend that animals possess emotions and resist being utilized as donors for heart transplants. Despite being a source of food for millennia, ethical concerns arise when considering the use of animals for living organs [66,67]. Some religious traditions, such as Judaism and Islam, prohibit pork consumption, yet some leaders consider pig organ transplants acceptable to preserve human life. For vegetarians, an ethical dilemma arises regarding sacrificing the lives of animals to save others, since animals and humans are also sentient beings [68]. Despite these ethical considerations, pigs remain a suitable donor source for heart transplantation [42]. \n\nThe interaction between a genetically modified pig heart and the human body, particularly concerning mental health, poses uncertainties. Recipient patients must be informed about this matter, considering its acceptance and addressing potential social issues [38,69].",

Dinh\n## Abstract\nCardiac xenotransplantation (cXT) has emerged as a solution to heart donor scarcity, prompting an exploration of its scientific, ethical, and regulatory facets. The review begins with genetic modifications enhancing pig hearts for human transplantation, navigating through immunological challenges, rejection mechanisms, and immune responses. Key areas include preclinical milestones, complement cascade roles, and genetic engineering to address hyperacute rejection. Physiological counterbalance systems, like human thrombomodulin and endothelial protein C receptor upregulation in porcine xenografts, highlight efforts for graft survival enhancement. Evaluating pig and baboon donors and challenges with non-human primates illuminates complexities in donor species selection. Ethical considerations, encompassing animal rights, welfare, and zoonotic disease risks, are critically examined in the cXT context. The review delves into immune control mechanisms with aggressive immunosuppression and clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) technology, elucidating hyperacute rejection, complement activation, and antibody-mediated rejection intricacies. CRISPR/Cas9\u2019s role in creating pig endothelial cells expressing human inhibitor molecules is explored for rejection mitigation. Ethical and regulatory aspects emphasize the role of committees and international guidelines. A forward-looking perspective envisions precision medical genetics, artificial intelligence, and individualized heart cultivation within pigs as transformative elements in cXT\u2019s future is also explored. This comprehensive analysis offers insights for researchers, clinicians, and policymakers, addressing the current state, and future prospects of cXT.\n## Ethical and Regulatory Aspects\nXenotransplantation is fraught with numerous ethical and social dilemmas, encompassing substantial costs and resource allocations essential for the research endeavor. Questions abound regarding the potential benefits of this scientific pursuit, along with lingering concerns regarding animal rights, animal welfare, and the genetic manipulation of animals designed for human consumption. Additionally, there is a pervasive apprehension surrounding the prospect of xenozoonosis, adding a layer of complexity to the ethical discourse surrounding this innovative field [6,43,61]. \n\nThe advantages of cXT are evident, particularly in light of the extensive waiting list for donors coupled with the scarcity of donor organs [9,62]. However, its true efficacy emerges when the long-term outcomes approach those of allotransplantation [6]. The application of GM techniques has been instrumental in bridging the gap between species, as demonstrated by the extension of survival time without rejection in humans with genetically modified pig hearts, reaching an impressive additional two months [35,36]. These successes underscore the potential for cXT to evolve into a pivotal solution for the organ transplant shortage. Looking ahead, the remarkable progress in genetic technology, coupled with the support of artificial intelligence (AI), holds the promise of further elevating cardiac transplantation [63][64][65]. This trajectory suggests a future where the shortage of organs for transplant may be effectively addressed through the continued refinement of genetic techniques and the integration of advanced technologies. \n\nAnimal rights activists contend that animals possess emotions and resist being utilized as donors for heart transplants. Despite being a source of food for millennia, ethical concerns arise when considering the use of animals for living organs [66,67]. Some religious traditions, such as Judaism and Islam, prohibit pork consumption, yet some leaders consider pig organ transplants acceptable to preserve human life. For vegetarians, an ethical dilemma arises regarding sacrificing the lives of animals to save others, since animals and humans are also sentient beings [68]. Despite these ethical considerations, pigs remain a suitable donor source for heart transplantation [42]. \n\nThe interaction between a genetically modified pig heart and the human body, particularly concerning mental health, poses uncertainties. Recipient patients must be informed about this matter, considering its acceptance and addressing potential social issues [38,69].",

In this review, we will examine the obstacles overcome and those yet to be conquered, discussing the human trials performed and the questions they raised. Additionally, we will revisit overlooked aspects that may be crucial for improvements and suggest future approaches for xenotransplant research. Recent Findings Improving survival in pig-to-non-human-primate models with the identification of an ideal immunosuppression regimen led to 3 cases of kidney xenotransplant in brain-dead humans with limited follow-up and a single clinical case of pig-to-human heart xenotransplant with 2-month survival. Summary With limited human results and unlimited potential, xenotransplantation shines a beacon of hope for a brighter future. However, we must navigate through the complexities of balancing scientific progress and patient welfare, avoiding being blinded by xenotransplantation\u2019s unquestionable potential.",

This concern has some regulatory agencies, such as the Council of Europe Recommendations Rec (2003) 10 of the Committee of Ministers to Member States on xenotransplantation, Article 21, stating that patients may have to waiver some of their human rights for close follow-up and monitoring.\n\nRegulatory and legal aspects will require worldwide cooperation for the initiation and growth of xenotransplant. Owing to the pervasive effects of globalization and unequal availability of healthcare and regulatory policies across regions, individuals seeking xenotransplantation may resort to traveling to countries with looser policies for the life-saving procedure, imposing increased risks for zoonosis upon their return home where animal husbandry and organ screening regulations are more stringent [71].\n\nMoreover, there are questions if a collective consent should be required prior to initiation of xenotransplant trials since this procedure may carry risks for a broader population beyond the patients participating in the study [71].",

In this review, we will examine the obstacles overcome and those yet to be conquered, discussing the human trials performed and the questions they raised. Additionally, we will revisit overlooked aspects that may be crucial for improvements and suggest future approaches for xenotransplant research. Recent Findings Improving survival in pig-to-non-human-primate models with the identification of an ideal immunosuppression regimen led to 3 cases of kidney xenotransplant in brain-dead humans with limited follow-up and a single clinical case of pig-to-human heart xenotransplant with 2-month survival. Summary With limited human results and unlimited potential, xenotransplantation shines a beacon of hope for a brighter future. However, we must navigate through the complexities of balancing scientific progress and patient welfare, avoiding being blinded by xenotransplantation\u2019s unquestionable potential.\n## Regulatory, Legal, and Ethical Concerns\nDespite the formidable genetic obstacles posed by current protocols, regulatory, legal, and ethical considerations may pose an even greater challenge for xenotransplant implementation.\n\nMany animal rights organizations are against the use of animals for research, including xenotransplantation.\n\nOthers argue that scientists may disturb the fundamental nature of a species, despite the fact that selective breeding has caused more extensive modifications than the ten genetic alterations engineered for xenotransplantation [69].\n\nAs xenotransplant may lead to zoonotic diseases with public health implications, one of the most challenging aspects of its implementation is the possible requirement of life-long monitoring for patients and their close contacts [70]. This concern has some regulatory agencies, such as the Council of Europe Recommendations Rec (2003) 10 of the Committee of Ministers to Member States on xenotransplantation, Article 21, stating that patients may have to waiver some of their human rights for close follow-up and monitoring.\n\nRegulatory and legal aspects will require worldwide cooperation for the initiation and growth of xenotransplant. Owing to the pervasive effects of globalization and unequal availability of healthcare and regulatory policies across regions, individuals seeking xenotransplantation may resort to traveling to countries with looser policies for the life-saving procedure, imposing increased risks for zoonosis upon their return home where animal husbandry and organ screening regulations are more stringent [71].\n\nMoreover, there are questions if a collective consent should be required prior to initiation of xenotransplant trials since this procedure may carry risks for a broader population beyond the patients participating in the study [71].",

There is an increasing focus from both the medical profession and society on how to fill the gap between supply and demand. Methods Xenotransplantation using animal organs is being considered as one option to make up for the shortage of human organs for transplantation. For some years now, the international medical community has been examining the possibility of using animal organs for human transplant. However, the research has faced two important types of challenges: scientific and ethical issues. Results In January 2021, the first clinical trial of transgenic pig heart transplantation into a human recipient was completed by the Medical Center of the University of Maryland in the United States.

However, given that the animal most suited for xenotransplantation is the pig, there are concerns that people in Muslim countries may be more hesitant to morally approve of these procedures. In this study, the moral approval of xenotransplantation was assessed in a group of 895 participants in Egypt. The results showed that religiosity itself does not predict moral approval of xenotransplantation, but religious identity does, as Muslims are less likely to approve of xenotransplantation than Christians. However, the strongest predictor of moral approval of xenotransplantation was gender, with women displaying less approval. A partial mediating factor in this association was concern for animal welfare. Based on these results, some implications for public policy are discussed.",

                    "text": "Other concerns are ethical. Xenotransplantation carries the potential risk of transmitting infectious diseases from animals to humans. Ethical concerns center on the precautionary principle, which suggests that xenotransplantation should not be pursued until the risks of zoonotic diseases are better understood and minimized [7]. Likewise, the long-term health and safety of recipients of xenotransplants are still not fully known, which raises ethical issues regarding patient safety and the potential for unforeseen complications [8]. \n\nThe ethics of human-animal relations are also an issue. There are concerns about the conditions in which donor animals are raised and the potential for harm, suffering, and exploitation of these animals [9]. As with animal experimentation, there is the ethical difficulty of consent [10]. In human-to-human organ transplantation, informed consent is typically obtained from donors or their families. In xenotransplantation, there is no way to obtain informed consent from the donor animals, raising ethical questions about the use of animals for the benefit of humans without their consent [11,12]. \n\nWhile these are ethical issues that are likely to affect xenotransplantation globally, there are also specific geographic areas where xenotransplantation might pose additional ethical concerns. For example, in countries with greater percentage of vegans amongst the population, or with higher sensitivity towards animal suffering, there may be hesitations about killing animals in order to use their organs. \n\nBut even more so, moral qualms about xenotransplantation may be especially salient regions where there are cultural prohibitions on pigs. Pigs are considered the most suited species for xenotransplantation [13], due to various reasons: their organs have similar sizes and functions as for humans; pigs are widely available, and they have potential for large scale reproduction; they are anatomically comparable to human beings; they can be genetically modified more effectively than some other animals; and humans have a lower risk of immune rejection of pig tissue. \n\nTraditionally, Islamic societies have considered pigs impure animals [14]. This is done on a scriptural basis.",

Elsantil, AlaaEldin Ayoub, Dalia Bedewy\n## Abstract\nXenotransplantation has great potential as an alternative to alleviate the shortage of organs for donation. However, given that the animal most suited for xenotransplantation is the pig, there are concerns that people in Muslim countries may be more hesitant to morally approve of these procedures. In this study, the moral approval of xenotransplantation was assessed in a group of 895 participants in Egypt. The results showed that religiosity itself does not predict moral approval of xenotransplantation, but religious identity does, as Muslims are less likely to approve of xenotransplantation than Christians. However, the strongest predictor of moral approval of xenotransplantation was gender, with women displaying less approval. A partial mediating factor in this association was concern for animal welfare. Based on these results, some implications for public policy are discussed.\n## Introduction\nXenotransplantation is the process of transplanting organs, tissues, or cells from one species into another species, most commonly into humans. The primary goal of xenotransplantation is to address the shortage of human donor organs and potentially provide a more readily available source of organs for transplantation [1]. \n\nThe process goes through various phases. First, animal donors are chosen on the basis of suitability of their organs being of similar in size and function to human organs; originally baboons and other non-human primates were used, since the 1980s pigs have been preferred in this endeavor. Second, donor animals are genetically modified to reduce the risk of immune rejection and transmission of diseases from animals to humans (xenozoonosis), donor animals are genetically modified [2]. This can involve removing or modifying specific genes responsible for producing antigens that are recognized by the human immune system. This process is known as \"humanization\" of the animal's organs. Even with genetic modifications, the human recipient's immune system can still recognize animal tissues as foreign and trigger a rejection response. To prevent this, recipients receive immunosuppressive drugs to dampen their immune response, similar to what is done in human-to-human organ transplantation [3]. \n\nThird, the donor animal organ, which has been genetically modified, is surgically transplanted into the human recipient. The specific surgical procedure varies depending on the organ being transplanted [4]. Fourth, after transplantation, the recipient is closely monitored for any signs of rejection or complications. Regular medical check-ups and immunosuppressive drug therapy adjustments may be necessary to maintain the viability of the transplanted organ [5]. \n\nWhile xenotransplantation is a promising alternative, some challenges remain. For example, immune rejection is still a problem, and there is a potential risk of transmitting animal viruses to humans, which must be carefully managed and monitored. Perhaps the bestknown case was that of Baby Fae, who died a few weeks later after receiving a baboon's organ, largely due to immunological complications [6]. This suggests that with xenotransplantation, there are concerns about the need for lifelong surveillance of patients after receiving the organ. \n\nOther concerns are ethical.\n...\nOther concerns are ethical. Xenotransplantation carries the potential risk of transmitting infectious diseases from animals to humans. Ethical concerns center on the precautionary principle, which suggests that xenotransplantation should not be pursued until the risks of zoonotic diseases are better understood and minimized [7]. Likewise, the long-term health and safety of recipients of xenotransplants are still not fully known, which raises ethical issues regarding patient safety and the potential for unforeseen complications [8]. \n\nThe ethics of human-animal relations are also an issue. There are concerns about the conditions in which donor animals are raised and the potential for harm, suffering, and exploitation of these animals [9]. As with animal experimentation, there is the ethical difficulty of consent [10]. In human-to-human organ transplantation, informed consent is typically obtained from donors or their families. In xenotransplantation, there is no way to obtain informed consent from the donor animals, raising ethical questions about the use of animals for the benefit of humans without their consent [11,12]. \n\nWhile these are ethical issues that are likely to affect xenotransplantation globally, there are also specific geographic areas where xenotransplantation might pose additional ethical concerns. For example, in countries with greater percentage of vegans amongst the population, or with higher sensitivity towards animal suffering, there may be hesitations about killing animals in order to use their organs. \n\nBut even more so, moral qualms about xenotransplantation may be especially salient regions where there are cultural prohibitions on pigs. Pigs are considered the most suited species for xenotransplantation [13], due to various reasons: their organs have similar sizes and functions as for humans; pigs are widely available, and they have potential for large scale reproduction; they are anatomically comparable to human beings; they can be genetically modified more effectively than some other animals; and humans have a lower risk of immune rejection of pig tissue. \n\nTraditionally, Islamic societies have considered pigs impure animals [14]. This is done on a scriptural basis.",

This has made the generation of genetically bespoke organisms a reality. This paper will analyze the regulatory and practical aspects of such an innovative approach to xenotransplantation on the basis of a hypothetical case study applied to Germany and highlight the gaps in the current regulation. This paper thus provides the basis for legal debate within a specific country. In addition, the identified gaps also pose a barrier toward the harmonization of international regulation. This publication therefore lays the groundwork for guiding the international debate regarding the regulatory framework for solid organ xenotransplantation toward specific issues.\n## Results and discussion\nA continued, systematic debate on common standards should therefore be a priority.\n\nIn addition, there are numerous ethical issues pertaining to xenotransplantation, which have been discussed for years (28)(29)(30)(31)(32)(33) and fall into three broad categories: the first argues that certain scientific experiments should simply not be undertaken; the second warns of unforeseen consequences of genetically altering organisms; and the third pertains to the suffering of involved animals.In addition, there is a continuous and heated debate about the permissibility of mixing animal and human material in the academic (34-36) as well as the public sector (37)(38)(39).\n\nThese ethical and legal questions need to be addressed before such an approach ever becomes routine.",

This leads to a conflict among those with animal welfare concerns because the need to raise a xenograftdonor pig in a sterile environment to protect the recipient is in direct conflict with the pig's natural instincts and needs. The degree of influence of both sides of this conflict has not yet been defined and warrants further exploration involving all stakeholders.\n\nAn additional source of ethical concern would be exposing the immunosuppressed patient to the possibility of zoonotic disease transmission. There are some viruses carried by pigs, particularly porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) and Nipah virus that are carried harmlessly by pigs but able to cause significant human disease as human cellular receptors for these viruses exist (88,90). A PERV is suspected to be the virus responsible for a 2009 epidemic of swine flu that led to the loss of over 250,000 human lives. The risk associated with zoonotic viruses would be amplified by posttransplant immunosuppression (3). There are also some bacteria that may potentially be transmitted by a xenograft that risk horizontal transmission across the community. This is in addition to already an increased infection risk burden that is taken on by transplant recipients because of induction and maintenance immunosuppression. This risk is substantially reduced with raising a pig intended as a xenograft donor in a dedicated sterile, biosecure environment, addressing biosafety concerns but raising the aforementioned ethical issues with regards animal welfare. Specialized molecular assays for viruses may also further reduce this risk (90). Utilizing CRISPR technology, a pig has been produced that has had all PERVs inactivated, reducing the risk of infection with PERVs that could occur with xenotransplantation and allaying this source of ethical quandary (71,90,91).\n\nLastly, public perception of scientific breakthroughs and advancement in the field of xenotransplantation raises both fascination and ethical concerns. There should be general societal involvement in the development of xenotransplant policy, but in the United States public understanding of scientific knowledge and the scientific method is lacking (88).\n\nThe field of ethics is often considered \"outside\" of the",

Keeping in mind the perspective of balancing risks and benefits between use and needs, it is worth mentioning that 240 patients on dialysis die every day in the United States (89).\n\nPigs raised as a source of xenografts would likely require confinement to reduce the risk of infection and subsequent transmission of an infection to the future recipient of the xenograft. Animals raised under such conditions would not be in an environment in which they would be able to freely roam and interact with other animals like some of their farm-raised counterparts (12,88). This leads to a conflict among those with animal welfare concerns because the need to raise a xenograftdonor pig in a sterile environment to protect the recipient is in direct conflict with the pig's\n...\nable to freely roam and interact with other animals like some of their farm-raised counterparts (12,88). This leads to a conflict among those with animal welfare concerns because the need to raise a xenograftdonor pig in a sterile environment to protect the recipient is in direct conflict with the pig's natural instincts and needs. The degree of influence of both sides of this conflict has not yet been defined and warrants further exploration involving all stakeholders.\n\nAn additional source of ethical concern would be exposing the immunosuppressed patient to the possibility of zoonotic disease transmission. There are some viruses carried by pigs, particularly porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) and Nipah virus that are carried harmlessly by pigs but able to cause significant human disease as human cellular receptors for these viruses exist (88,90). A PERV is suspected to be the virus responsible for a 2009 epidemic of swine flu that led to the loss of over 250,000 human lives. The risk associated with zoonotic viruses would be amplified by posttransplant immunosuppression (3). There are also some bacteria that may potentially be transmitted by a xenograft that risk horizontal transmission across the community. This is in addition to already an increased infection risk burden that is taken on by transplant recipients because of induction and maintenance immunosuppression. This risk is substantially reduced with raising a pig intended as a xenograft donor in a dedicated sterile, biosecure environment, addressing biosafety concerns but raising the aforementioned ethical issues with regards animal welfare. Specialized molecular assays for viruses may also further reduce this risk (90). Utilizing CRISPR technology, a pig has been produced that has had all PERVs inactivated, reducing the risk of infection with PERVs that could occur with xenotransplantation and allaying this source of ethical quandary (71,90,91).\n\nLastly, public perception of scientific breakthroughs and advancement in the field of xenotransplantation raises both fascination and ethical concerns. There should be general societal involvement in the development of xenotransplant policy, but in the United States public understanding of scientific knowledge and the scientific method is lacking (88).\n\nThe field of ethics is often considered \"outside\" of the",

Major differences in cultural and religious beliefs will make it particularly challenging to build consensus guidelines on XTx.\n\nOne major ethical consideration in XTx is the concern for animal rights and the anthropocentric view of putting humans above all other animal species. 88 The welfare of animals being bred in laboratories with living conditions that significantly differ from their usual environments will need to be defined. 89 Other challenges include the fairness of resource allocation and distributive justice, in an era when there is already much confusion in patients with respect to the current organ allocation system.\n\nAnother major aspect will be appropriately educating clinicians and patients, particularly with respect to the challenge of obtaining well-informed consent in an area with a high degree of uncertainty. These considerable ethical, social, and legal challenges will require careful consideration and discourse in a manner concurrent with scientific advances in the field. believe that XTx will likely find application as a bridge to allotransplantation, an alternative to destination therapy in those with persistent right HF or even in patients in need of a second transplantation because of first transplantation failure, in whom ethical challenges exist with the use of an allograft because of a lesser expected outcome.",

Major differences in cultural and religious beliefs will make it particularly challenging to build consensus guidelines on XTx.\n\nOne major ethical consideration in XTx is the concern for animal rights and the anthropocentric view of putting humans above all other animal species. 88 The welfare of animals being bred in laboratories with living conditions that significantly differ from their usual environments will need to be defined. 89 Other challenges include the fairness of resource allocation and distributive justice, in an era when there is already much confusion in patients with respect to the current organ allocation system.\n\nAnother major aspect will be appropriately educating clinicians and patients, particularly with respect to the challenge of obtaining well-informed consent in an area with a high degree of uncertainty. These considerable ethical, social, and legal challenges will require careful consideration and discourse in a manner concurrent with scientific advances in the field. believe that XTx will likely find application as a bridge to allotransplantation, an alternative to destination therapy in those with persistent right HF or even in patients in need of a second transplantation because of first transplantation failure, in whom ethical challenges exist with the use of an allograft because of a lesser expected outcome.",

In this article, we first provide an introductory overview of the key legal, ethical and psychosocial considerations identified in the existing literature and identify areas where research is currently lacking. We then highlight two principal areas of concern in which these discrete disciplines significantly overlap: 1) individual autonomy and 2) access and equality. Using the example of beta-cell provenance, we demonstrate how, by harnessing an interdisciplinary approach we can address these key areas of concern. Moreover, we provide practical recommendations to researchers, clinicians, and policymakers which will help to facilitate the clinical translation of this cutting-edge technology for Type 1 Diabetes patients.

Thom, Antonia J. Cronin, Eline M. Bunnik, E. Massey\n## Abstract\nThe field of regenerative medicine offers potential therapies for Type 1 Diabetes, whereby metabolically active cellular components are combined with synthetic medical devices. These therapies are sometimes referred to as \u201cbioartificial pancreases.\u201d For these emerging and rapidly developing therapies to be clinically translated to patients, researchers must overcome not just scientific hurdles, but also navigate complex legal, ethical and psychosocial issues. In this article, we first provide an introductory overview of the key legal, ethical and psychosocial considerations identified in the existing literature and identify areas where research is currently lacking. We then highlight two principal areas of concern in which these discrete disciplines significantly overlap: 1) individual autonomy and 2) access and equality. Using the example of beta-cell provenance, we demonstrate how, by harnessing an interdisciplinary approach we can address these key areas of concern. Moreover, we provide practical recommendations to researchers, clinicians, and policymakers which will help to facilitate the clinical translation of this cutting-edge technology for Type 1 Diabetes patients. Finally, we emphasize the importance of exploring patient perspectives to ensure their responsible and acceptable translation from bench to body.\n## Xenogeneic Cells\nCells derived from genetically modified animal (namely, porcine) sources have been suggested as alternatives. However, the use of xenogeneic cells raises even more challenging potential psychosocial and ethical barriers leading to varying legal approaches. These include moral concerns for animal rights and welfare, religious beliefs [51,55] and the risks for wider society, particularly that of zoonosis [51,56]. The EU has issued guidelines for an approach to the medicinal use of animal cells [57]. However, due to the culturally sensitive nature of this topic the overall permissibility of xenotransplantation is a matter devolved to individual member states. Despite centralized recommendations, markedly different approaches have been",

However, the development of new technologies without proper legislative preparation raises significant moral and ethical considerations. This paper provides an overview of the current state of xenotransplantology, highlighting its revolutionary potential alongside the moral dilemmas it entails.\nAim of the study: The aim of this study is to assess current social, ethical, religious, and legal trends regarding the issue of xenotransplantation.\nMaterials and methods: To obtain up-to-date information concerning trends in xenotransplantation, a review of the PubMed and Google Scholar databases, along with the latest legislative reports in both Europe and Poland, was performed.\nConclusions: Firstly, the authors briefly report on the current situation concerning transplantology and the widely spread organ donor crisis. Next, the issue of species boundaries and the moral status of non-human animals is addressed. The assessment of ethical implications of utilizing animals as organ donors is examined, along with the legal acts regulating this issue. Moreover, the authors attempt to evaluate the cultural and religious differences related to this concern. Furthermore, this study discusses the allocation and distribution of xenotransplants, considering issues of justice, fairness, and access to this innovative medical technology. Lastly, the paper delves into the risks and uncertainties associated with xenotransplantation, including the possibility of cross-species disease transmission and intensified course of organ rejection disease.\n",

Cronin\n## Abstract\nThis manuscript reports on a landmark symposium on the ethical, legal and technical challenges of xenotransplantation in the UK. King\u2019s College London, with endorsement from the British Transplantation Society (BTS), and the European Society of Organ Transplantation (ESOT), brought together a group of experts in xenotransplantation science, ethics and law to discuss the ethical, regulatory and technical challenges surrounding translating xenotransplantation into the clinical setting. The symposium was the first of its kind in the UK for 20 years. This paper summarises the content of the expert lectures showcasing the progress which has been made in xenotransplantation including\u2014the history of xenotransplantation, advances in gene edited animals and progress towards clinical xenotransplantation. We then set out the ethical and legal issues still to be resolved. Finally, we report the themes of the roundtable discussion highlighting areas of consensus and controversy. While the detail of the legal discussion was directed towards the UK, the principles and summary reported here are intended to be applicable to any jurisdiction seeking to implement clinical xenotransplantation.\n",

Immune rejection, physiological incompatibility and bio\u2010safety are the most critical issues. Methods To ensure the safety and efficacy of gene editing, second\u2010 and third\u2010generation sequencing technologies have allowed us to obtain a clearer genetic background of donor pigs for xenotransplantation. Based on the Changsha Communiqu\u00e9, the local DPF\u2010 excluded lists and DPF donor facility were established in Changsha, China. A pig\u2010to\u2010human islet clinical trial was conducted and overseen by the respective Chinese governmental agency. Results The DPF standards for pig husbandry eliminated specific pathogens in donor pigs. We have established a PERV\u2010C free, genetic information clean, DPF donor for xenotransplantation. A clinical trial of ten adult patients (9M:1F) with type 1 diabetes who received DPF porcine islet xenotransplantation via the portal vein were performed. Clinical accepted immunosuppressant drugs and autologous Treg were used for controlling immune rejection. No cross\u2010species infection events occurred in this trial, and importantly, no cross\u2010species transmission of PERV was found. Conclusions Xenotransplantation is a pioneer study and safety is the most important issue. The fundamental principles for establishing xenotransplantation donor pigs should follow the Changsha Communiqu\u00e9 (2008), the second WHO consultation,and the 2018 Changsha Communiqu\u00e9 which would finally help reducing the risks of xenotransplantation.",

Griffith and scientific/program director Muhammad Mohiuddin [3], successfully transplanted a gene-edited pig heart into a patient with end-stage cardiac failure at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.The donor pigs had 10 genetic modifications.Four genes were knocked out or inactivated, including one encoding a molecule (Nglycolylneuraminic acid) that causes an aggressive human rejection response and a growth gene (growth hormone receptor) that was knocked out to prevent the pig's heart from growing after transplantation.",

Immune rejection, physiological incompatibility and bio\u2010safety are the most critical issues. Methods To ensure the safety and efficacy of gene editing, second\u2010 and third\u2010generation sequencing technologies have allowed us to obtain a clearer genetic background of donor pigs for xenotransplantation. Based on the Changsha Communiqu\u00e9, the local DPF\u2010 excluded lists and DPF donor facility were established in Changsha, China. A pig\u2010to\u2010human islet clinical trial was conducted and overseen by the respective Chinese governmental agency. Results The DPF standards for pig husbandry eliminated specific pathogens in donor pigs. We have established a PERV\u2010C free, genetic information clean, DPF donor for xenotransplantation. A clinical trial of ten adult patients (9M:1F) with type 1 diabetes who received DPF porcine islet xenotransplantation via the portal vein were performed. Clinical accepted immunosuppressant drugs and autologous Treg were used for controlling immune rejection. No cross\u2010species infection events occurred in this trial, and importantly, no cross\u2010species transmission of PERV was found. Conclusions Xenotransplantation is a pioneer study and safety is the most important issue. The fundamental principles for establishing xenotransplantation donor pigs should follow the Changsha Communiqu\u00e9 (2008), the second WHO consultation,and the 2018 Changsha Communiqu\u00e9 which would finally help reducing the risks of xenotransplantation.\n## body\nXenotransplantation is an attractive solution to bridge the gap between the demand for and availability of cadaveric human organs, tissues, and cells for clinical needs.The Changsha Communiqu\u00e9 released by the World Health Organization (WHO) is the first declaration outlining the international guideline for xenotransplantation clinical research [1].However, before the clinical application of xenografts, three major hurdles must be overcome: immune rejection, physiological incompatibility, and the transmission of zoonoses.The donor animal is the most critical issue.The Changsha Communiqu\u00e9 declares that animals used in xenotransplantation should be acquired from a closed herd bred for the purpose of xenotransplantation and housed in a well-controlled, pathogen-free environment with high animal welfare standards.The donor animals should also be extensively tested to ensure freedom from known pathogens, with appropriate biosecurity and surveillance in place to ensure this.\n\nImmune rejection and physiological incompatibility can perhaps be solved using gene-editing technology.Genetic modifications of the donor pig can reduce the incidence of immune rejection and prolong the survival of porcine xenografts.Research achievements in this field have accelerated during the past decade because of novel geneediting and cloning technologies.Recently, Dr. Porrett [2] successfully performed kidney transplantation from a genetically engineered pig to a brain-dead person (leaving the kidney outside the body) in Alabama.The kidney functioned immediately and was not rejected during the 74-h period of the study.In early January 2022, Cardiac Xenotransplantation Program's clinical director Bartley P. Griffith and scientific/program director Muhammad Mohiuddin [3], successfully transplanted a gene-edited pig heart into a patient with end-stage cardiac failure at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.The donor pigs had 10 genetic modifications.Four genes were knocked out or inactivated, including one encoding a molecule (Nglycolylneuraminic acid) that causes an aggressive human rejection response and a growth gene (growth hormone receptor) that was knocked out to prevent the pig's heart from growing after transplantation.",

            "text": "However, with this promise comes a complex web of ethical considerations and legal frameworks that must be carefully navigated to ensure the responsible and ethical translation of xenotransplantation from the laboratory to the clinic. With this we must ensure that the same endemic issues do not occur with xenotransplantation that have occurred with human organ transplantation such as xenotransplant tourism (5) and unethical processes used to make profits at the expense of the animals used and the patients that may be misled into undertaking unapproved procedures (6). \n\nHistorically, xenotransplantation has faced significant challenges, including the perceived/potential for the transmission of diseases from animals to humans (xenozoonosis) (7), concerns over animal welfare (when breeding and producing the donor animals) (8), cultural and religious issues particularly the notion of crossing species boundaries in the use of their tissues for transplantation (6). These challenges led to the imposition of strict regulations along with embargos and a nuanced ethical debate that continues to shape the direction of the field. In recent years, ground-breaking advancements in genetic engineering has rapidly accelerated the field which offers new hope, massively advancing the creation of genetically modified pigs with organs engineered for compatibility with the human immune system (9). These developments have paved the way for the initiation of trials in humans involving xeno-hearts approved under \"compassionate use\" for live patients (10) along with xeno-hearts and kidneys being studied clinically in a new model using \"Brain Dead\" recipients (11,12) along with very successful preclinical trials using transgenic pig islet cells (13). \n\nIn this review, we explore the ethical and legislative advances that are underpinning xenotransplantation as it moves toward broadly accepted clinical translation. We delve into the ethical considerations surrounding xenotransplantation, examining questions related to the potential risks of xenozoonotic disease transmission, animal rights, their use, and the public's perception of this innovative medical approach. We also survey the changes in legislative frameworks governing xenotransplantation, charting their evolution over time, and highlighting the necessity of harmonization and standardisation in regulations worldwide.",

            "text": "[35][36] These ethical issues are predominantly discussed under the assumption that xenotransplantation should proceed and focus on mitigating human-related concerns with further technical refinement and testing. Questions such as how to justly allocate organs among patients in need, which patients should be chosen as initial recipients of experimental xenotransplant, how to obtain informed consent from vulnerable populations, and how to ensure access to long-term novel immunosuppression are well considered in existing scholarship, while public health risks and the viability of alternative strategies to increase organ availability are given less coverage. In addition, there are myriad ethical issues related to nonhuman animals' use in xenotransplant research and practice, including their sentience, suffering, and moral status, but discussions fall short by making inappropriate comparisons to animal use for food or by focusing strictly on animal welfare. [12] ore comprehensive ethics considerations by all stakeholders, including the general public, are necessary to decide the societal acceptability and desirability of xenotransplantation research and commercialization. \n\nAs with animal agriculture, the large-scale farming of pigs for xenotransplantation requires animals to live truncated lives under unnatural conditions. Pathogen-free environments require excluding animals from their natural pasture habitat and raising them in sterile, indoor housing, which severely limits their natural range of animal behavior and social interactions. Captivity, isolation, handling, transport, and other standard conditions of modern pig farming cause significant stress responses in pigs, with a variety of biological and physiological consequences. [37] he number and type of animals at stake are not only the pigs used directly for each transplant, but also the pigs and primates used in research to refine xenotransplant methods and justify human recipient trials, as well as the animals used as feed. Furthermore, not every animal would be killed for their organs; some would be kept for breeding; and some would inevitably fail to meet the required criteria for organ viability, such as the absence of pathogens, and it is unlikely that these animals would be routed to environments in which they can flourish. Every pig and nonhuman primate used in these contexts is a cognitively complex animal with the capacity for significant suffering. [38]",

            "text": "Other concerns are ethical. Xenotransplantation carries the potential risk of transmitting infectious diseases from animals to humans. Ethical concerns center on the precautionary principle, which suggests that xenotransplantation should not be pursued until the risks of zoonotic diseases are better understood and minimized [7]. Likewise, the long-term health and safety of recipients of xenotransplants are still not fully known, which raises ethical issues regarding patient safety and the potential for unforeseen complications [8]. \n\nThe ethics of human-animal relations are also an issue. There are concerns about the conditions in which donor animals are raised and the potential for harm, suffering, and exploitation of these animals [9]. As with animal experimentation, there is the ethical difficulty of consent [10]. In human-to-human organ transplantation, informed consent is typically obtained from donors or their families. In xenotransplantation, there is no way to obtain informed consent from the donor animals, raising ethical questions about the use of animals for the benefit of humans without their consent [11,12]. \n\nWhile these are ethical issues that are likely to affect xenotransplantation globally, there are also specific geographic areas where xenotransplantation might pose additional ethical concerns. For example, in countries with greater percentage of vegans amongst the population, or with higher sensitivity towards animal suffering, there may be hesitations about killing animals in order to use their organs. \n\nBut even more so, moral qualms about xenotransplantation may be especially salient regions where there are cultural prohibitions on pigs. Pigs are considered the most suited species for xenotransplantation [13], due to various reasons: their organs have similar sizes and functions as for humans; pigs are widely available, and they have potential for large scale reproduction; they are anatomically comparable to human beings; they can be genetically modified more effectively than some other animals; and humans have a lower risk of immune rejection of pig tissue. \n\nTraditionally, Islamic societies have considered pigs impure animals [14]. This is done on a scriptural basis.",

            "text": "Simple Summary The dream of transferring bodily organs from animals to humans goes back to antiquity, as articulated in the myth of Daedalus and Icarus. But the genuine possibility of xenotransplantation is largely a creature of the last half-century. That possibility raises a plethora of genuine ethical issues, as well as spurious ones occasioned by societal ignorance of science. Abstract There are three sorts of issues associated with genetic engineering and, by implication, with xenotransplantation. These are dangers associated with the technology, animal welfare issues, and the claim that genetic engineering represents a technology that humans should not embark upon. Using the hearts of pigs for humans in need of transplants has been a major issue in xenotransplantation. There are dangers associated with such use, such as immunological rejection of the organ, endogenous viruses infecting the recipients, and issues of privacy. In addition, the issue of fair distribution of organs arises. Animal welfare issues also arise, most notably the living conditions of the donor animals, issues notably present in confinement agriculture. A major issue emerges from animals\u2019 being kept under conditions that fail to meet the needs dictated by the animals\u2019 biological and psychological natures. Xenotransplantation animals will be kept under deprived laboratory conditions that similarly fail to meet the animals\u2019 natures. This is a significant concern for society in general. There are also issues of \u201cbad ethics\u201d arising from scientists\u2019 disavowal of ethical concerns in science. This in turn, coupled with societal ignorance of science, creates a climate for proliferation of religious and other non-rational concerns, such as the claim that xenotransplantation violates God\u2019s will. These spurious concerns can only be ameliorated when public understanding of science improves, and scientific understanding of ethics increases.",

Major differences in cultural and religious beliefs will make it particularly challenging to build consensus guidelines on XTx.\n\nOne major ethical consideration in XTx is the concern for animal rights and the anthropocentric view of putting humans above all other animal species. 88 The welfare of animals being bred in laboratories with living conditions that significantly differ from their usual environments will need to be defined. 89 Other challenges include the fairness of resource allocation and distributive justice, in an era when there is already much confusion in patients with respect to the current organ allocation system.\n\nAnother major aspect will be appropriately educating clinicians and patients, particularly with respect to the challenge of obtaining well-informed consent in an area with a high degree of uncertainty. These considerable ethical, social, and legal challenges will require careful consideration and discourse in a manner concurrent with scientific advances in the field. believe that XTx will likely find application as a bridge to allotransplantation, an alternative to destination therapy in those with persistent right HF or even in patients in need of a second transplantation because of first transplantation failure, in whom ethical challenges exist with the use of an allograft because of a lesser expected outcome.",

            "text": "Xenotransplantation is fraught with numerous ethical and social dilemmas, encompassing substantial costs and resource allocations essential for the research endeavor. Questions abound regarding the potential benefits of this scientific pursuit, along with lingering concerns regarding animal rights, animal welfare, and the genetic manipulation of animals designed for human consumption. Additionally, there is a pervasive apprehension surrounding the prospect of xenozoonosis, adding a layer of complexity to the ethical discourse surrounding this innovative field [6,43,61]. \n\nThe advantages of cXT are evident, particularly in light of the extensive waiting list for donors coupled with the scarcity of donor organs [9,62]. However, its true efficacy emerges when the long-term outcomes approach those of allotransplantation [6]. The application of GM techniques has been instrumental in bridging the gap between species, as demonstrated by the extension of survival time without rejection in humans with genetically modified pig hearts, reaching an impressive additional two months [35,36]. These successes underscore the potential for cXT to evolve into a pivotal solution for the organ transplant shortage. Looking ahead, the remarkable progress in genetic technology, coupled with the support of artificial intelligence (AI), holds the promise of further elevating cardiac transplantation [63][64][65]. This trajectory suggests a future where the shortage of organs for transplant may be effectively addressed through the continued refinement of genetic techniques and the integration of advanced technologies. \n\nAnimal rights activists contend that animals possess emotions and resist being utilized as donors for heart transplants. Despite being a source of food for millennia, ethical concerns arise when considering the use of animals for living organs [66,67]. Some religious traditions, such as Judaism and Islam, prohibit pork consumption, yet some leaders consider pig organ transplants acceptable to preserve human life. For vegetarians, an ethical dilemma arises regarding sacrificing the lives of animals to save others, since animals and humans are also sentient beings [68]. Despite these ethical considerations, pigs remain a suitable donor source for heart transplantation [42]. \n\nThe interaction between a genetically modified pig heart and the human body, particularly concerning mental health, poses uncertainties. Recipient patients must be informed about this matter, considering its acceptance and addressing potential social issues [38,69].",

It poses profound philosophical and ethical questions about the nature of different species and the moral obligation we owe to different species. As we engage in practices that involve genetic modification and the use of animals for human benefit, the ethical boundaries are changing with increasing pressure on ethics committees and legislators to keep track with the pace of change, and we have a moral imperative to ensure that we do keep pace and provide adequate oversight (6). \n\nSome ethicists argue that xenotransplantation exemplifies the Anthropocentric approach (38), emphasizing human interests over those of animals, while others advocate for a more inclusive biocentric perspective that values all forms of life equally (39). The challenge is to find a balance between medical innovation and ethical responsibility to both animal and man (6).",

This concern has some regulatory agencies, such as the Council of Europe Recommendations Rec (2003) 10 of the Committee of Ministers to Member States on xenotransplantation, Article 21, stating that patients may have to waiver some of their human rights for close follow-up and monitoring.\n\nRegulatory and legal aspects will require worldwide cooperation for the initiation and growth of xenotransplant. Owing to the pervasive effects of globalization and unequal availability of healthcare and regulatory policies across regions, individuals seeking xenotransplantation may resort to traveling to countries with looser policies for the life-saving procedure, imposing increased risks for zoonosis upon their return home where animal husbandry and organ screening regulations are more stringent [71].\n\nMoreover, there are questions if a collective consent should be required prior to initiation of xenotransplant trials since this procedure may carry risks for a broader population beyond the patients participating in the study [71].",

            "text": "Xenotransplantation necessitates the use of animals as organ donors. Pigs being primarily used due to their physiological compatibility with humans, their ability to be bred in large numbers at a rapid rate, and their ability to be readily genetically altered. This along with their longstanding acceptance as a source of medical products such as drugs and heart valves and other decellularized tissues. With by far the strongest reason being there acceptance as a major food supply and source of products for man for as long as they have been domesticated should ensure their ease of use ethically (6). However, the welfare of these animals is of paramount concern. As some organizations push the principal that pigs are not merely commodities but sentient beings with the capacity to experience pain and suffering. \n\nThe major issues raised are to ensure the donor pigs are being ethically and humanely cared for and ensure the process of genetic manipulation does not cause them any health issues. One could argue that the facilities and conditions that these animals are housed and the care they receive is of a superior level to a normal commercial piggery due to the highly controlled and run facilities including the need for donor animals to be in DPF facilities. Underpinning this is the fact that all animal research projects including the breeding of, care and handling of the animals are undertaken in strict compliance under animal ethics legislation and under scrutiny of ethics committees (6). The genetic modifications required for these donor animals have been carefully designed to ensure they do not affect the health of the source pigs at all. Therefor from an ethical standpoint the level of suffering could be perceived as minimal or negligible. On the other hand, the potential benefit for patients is very high, being lifesaving and life changing (6). \n\nThere are also the ethical concerns for pre-clinical study recipients the various animals used and especially the non-humanprimates (NHP) which are the benchmark for preclinical trials. Their use is highly recommended prior to acceptance of any program moving to the clinic, and has been advised in many guidance's such as the \"Changsha Communique\" that recommend their use to provide safe and efficacious treatment regimen and modalities prior to commencement of any clinical trials (4).",

This entails conducting research on various aspects, including the patient (and relatives') perspective (consent, autonomy, selection process, identity and subjectivities), the construction of the animals involved, the forms of regulation, biopolitics and bioeconomy (including the competition between various differently engineered pigs/products) in play on a national and global scale, the knowledge constructed through xenotransplantation, public opinion and the various publics produced through xenotransplantation, the opinions of researchers, clinicians and other stakeholders and the interplay between allotransplantation and xenotransplantation, along with their dynamics and management among other relevant factors. \n\nBy emphasising the importance of the social issues and challenges discussed in this article, we hope to raise awareness among medical staff, researchers and policymakers involved in xenotransplantation regarding these matters. \n\nTwitter Peta S Cook @PetaCook",

            "text": "Organ transplantation raises numerous ethical issues. Even transplanting kidneys from deceased human donors with their prior consent can raise some ethical concerns. For example, we may wonder about the conditions under which their consent is secured, or question a definition of death [1,2]; we may find the content and consequences of their consent objectionable, as when racist donors agree to transplants provided priority is given to members of their own race when distributing their organs [3]; or we may object to transplants of certain organs, such as wombs, because of the possible effects on third parties, such as the baby growing with immunosuppressants [4]. \n\nIn cases of xenotransplantation, when the donor and the recipient belong to different species, further issues arise, regarding (i) the unavoidable harms to the donor and (ii) the possible harms to the recipients. When the donor is a chimeric pig, designed to contain a percentage of human genes and cells, xenotransplantation provokes two opposing sets of reactions [5]. \n\nFor some, the use of human-pig chimeras strengthens both recipient-based and donor-based objections, rendering xenotransplantation more objectionable or even impermissible. Many feel an aversion to such a deep transgression of the natural order, for reasons that may be theological, ecological, or involve human dignity, animal rights or fear of scientists yet again producing undesirable, unforeseen, and irreversible consequences. Others have more specific concerns. For example, the US National Institutes of Health suspended funding of their chimeric xenotransplantation program in 2015 over concerns about introducing human DNA into a member of another species, and particularly doing so at such an early developmental stage. As Carrie Wolinetz, Salz Institute's Associate Director for Science Policy, explains: 'people were concerned about human cells populating the brain of the animal or the germline of the animal' [6]. In the first case, the animal might acquire morally relevant human traits; in the second case, the animal might transmit human genes and traits to its offspring, for example, if accidentally released into the wild.",

            "text": "It is perhaps worth comparing this experience to the first cardiac allotransplants in the mid-1960s that typically lasted a few weeks. 29e ethics of xenotransplantation Xenotransplantation has raised considerable ethical discussion and has led to the production of guidelines and regulatory documents by a number of authoritative professional and governmental organisations. 30In general, the ethical debate has been informed by three ethical approaches; emotional, deontological and consequentialism.To a large extent the main lines of the ethical debate have been fixed for several decades.In this paper I will review some of the current debate, before looking at a different ethical framework, that of virtue ethics, to examine how that might inform the practice of scientists and doctors in the field of xenotransplantation.Some of the major ethical issues in xenotransplantation are shown in Table 1.These include the risk of porcine-derived infectious agents causing disease in humans; 31 awareness of the risk of zoonotic disease has been heightened by the COVID-19 pandemic. 32Other issues relate to the impact on the patient, the animal donors, identity and also issues relating to the allocation of organs and whether this is a resource effective solution to health challenges.In addition to these, ethical issues common to all clinical practice and research naturally apply equally to xenotransplantation. 33,34 Emotional Much of the response to xenotransplantation is an emotional response.People are either drawn to the concept or repulsed by the very idea of putting animal tissue in humans.These emotional responses have been of long standing.Many cultures have been fascinated in chimeras, fantastical mixtures of different animals. 44In equal measure, people have been long been horrified when medicine has been seen to cross certain boundaries; much of the antagonism to Jenner's cowpox vaccination stemmed from a belief it went against God and nature. 45enotransplantation excites an emotional response in many ways. 35,46Some people see interfering with the genetic makeup of pigs, especially if that involves the introduction of human genes, as crossing some form of moral boundary.For some this will be because scientists are disturbing the intrinsic nature of the species.",

            "text": "As stated in the latest Changsha Communiqu\u00e9, public engagement and consultation are important to build societal acceptance of a new treatment that exposes the world's population to new risks, including the remote risk that xenotransplantation could expose humankind to the emergence of a new pandemic infection [63]. \n\nUntil now, public engagement regarding xenotransplantation trials has not been systematically undertaken. Active research in the field of xenotransplantation in the 1990s/2000s was associated with several reports related to the ethical and safety aspects of xenotransplantation [65,66]. Overall, these were favorable, with support of xenotransplantation by the major religions based on easing the suffering of patients if the basic principles of biomedical ethics are observed and animals are treated humanely and with respect [65,67,68]. \n\nA common assumption is that patients with end-stage organ failure who are not eligible for allotransplantation will be enthusiastic participants in xenotransplantation programs and several studies have demonstrated this [3]. However, this has not always been the case, as one study reported that a proportion of acutecare nurses were opposed to xenotransplantation, although this was in the late 1980s when primates were the donors of choice for clinical xenotransplantation [69]. This negative perception has changed as there seems to be less issue with the pig as the donor source animal. However, concerns raised include animal rights and welfare, patient acceptance and informed consent, risk of infectious diseases, and broader public health issues [70]. \n\nThe costs of organ transplantation underlie the potential for inappropriate or corrupt practices in living donor or even cadaveric organ donation in poorer socioeconomic countries. The gap between demand and supply of organs for transplant has led to organ trafficking, organ tourism, and commercialism. This problem remains an overwhelmingly negative issue and raises ethical dilemmas that could be resolved if xenotransplantation were successful and broadly adopted [5,71]. Additionally, multiorgan donation costs are extensive, complicating current financial repatriation to the donor family, donor hospitals, organ donor agencies, and all involved in the extensive logistics of the organ donor process.",

            "text": "Xenotransplantation marks a qualitatively new challenge in medical technology assessment. The reasons for this claim are twofold: (i) in contrast to more traditional medical interventions, xenotransplantation involves risks not only to the patient, but also to larger segments of society, thus to public health in general. (ii) while most medical technologies demand assessment and risk-management at the time when the technology is sufficiently developed to be put into practice, xenotransplantation demands pro-active action at a very early stage of development. A particular challenge for any assessment of xenotransplantation is the inclusion of a satisfactory approach to the ethical issues involved. In itself this is, of course, not particular/unique to xenotransplantation, as most medical interventions need a good consideration of ethics. But seen in connection with the two characteristics mentioned above, this amounts to a truly formidable task. Given that discussions about xenotransplantation are rather recent, and given that a real scientific development is \u2013 luckily I am inclined to say \u2013 still pending and assumedly not to be expected for several years to come, it is not surprising that the debate about the ethics involved is still very tentative. Several academic papers and several government reports from a variety of countries do indeed deal with the ethical issues of xenotransplantation. But it is, as far as I can see, still too early to say that a general consensus has been reached about what precisely the ethical issues are, and, more importantly, how best to deal with them. What is important, though, is that the discussion about ethics in xenotransplantation has started, and that it follows the medical-scientific advances very closely. This is in itself a consoling reminder that ethical awareness in modern societies is coming more and more to the fore front of public debate, and that ethics is put on the agenda, including the political agenda, like never before. In this paper I shall leave out a number of ethical issues that need to be dealt with if the ethical assessment is to be comprehensive. These are e.g. issues concerning animal welfare and ethics, issues concerning standard medical ethics about how to prepare patients for serious medical interventions, or issues concerning what could be considered a equitable distribution of scarce",

Public perception of the ethics surrounding xenotransplantation can significantly influence its acceptance and, consequently, the regulatory environment. As such there has been significant engagement with both societal and religious organizations to ensure robust understanding of the key concepts and garner opinion and support (6,35,36). \n\nThe IXA has endeavored to undertake public engagement with ongoing dialogue which are essential to fostering trust with transparency and acceptance. It is incumbent on the broader scientific community and policymakers to communicate the steps taken to mitigate ethical concerns and to provide evidence of the rigorous ethical oversight and animal welfare standards applied in xenotransplantation research. Furthermore the governing organization of xenotransplantation the IXA is maintaining its mission to promote xenotransplantation as a safe, ethical, and effective therapeutic modality by; fostering the science of xenotransplantation through promotion of ethical clinical and pre-clinical research, productive discourse, and collaboration; along with further educating health care providers and lay persons through broad, representative participation interactive public debate; and also guiding the development of scientifically sound, internationally consistent public policy that is responsive to new developments in the field and acknowledges varying social, ethical and legal frameworks (37). Along with ongoing engagement with regulatory bodies and other agencies to ensure they balance the advancement of science but safeguarding the ethical principles. This is actively being undertaken with a strong push from the IXA to engage numerous agencies globally to ensure this continues to occur and keep pace with the rapidly developing technologies (8).",

            "text": "The word \"Xenos\" is a Greek word meaning foreign or strange. Xenografting is heterologous transplantation involving the grafting of viable cells, tissues, or organs between two species (e.g., a dog and a pig). It is a cross-species transplantation method. The continued demand for viable organs, tissues, and cells brought about by end-stage organ failure and chronic diseases has been the driving force in this medical/scientific research and practice [25]. However, it has been confronted with the significant challenges of immunological barriers and ethical issues. Organ rejection is widespread in xenotransplantation. In humans, for instance, natural antibodies circulate in the blood, and these cause instant transplant rejection when the organdonating species is, for example, a pig. Again, the complement systems are often activated each time organs from pigs are grafted into humans or primates and are highly prone to profound system toxicity due to the central role played by the complement system in body homeostasis and metabolism [26]. The porcine complementary proteins are foreign to primate complement regulatory systems. Studies have shown that genetic engineering may be a way out of this complementary system challenge if pigs are genetically modified to contain some human complement regulatory proteins in their cells [27]. \n\nAnother fundamental challenge facing xenograft is ethical issues. Three ethical issues quickly come to mind when we talk of xenotransplantation: animal rights (effects on the donor animal), human rights (the impact on the human population and the impact on the individual recipient), and interference with nature. An animal rights issue arises because animals, like humans, also have rights to existence and should not be sacrificed in favor of humans [28]. Human rights regarding the recipient can quickly be cleared by obtaining the necessary informed consent. Still, the populace also needs authorization because of the possibility of transferring new pathogens from animal to human populations -a public health risk [1]. The ethical issue of interference with nature may not be so applied. It may be understandable that by interfering with nature, man can free himself from the extinction effects of some natural phenomena [28].",

            "text": "Transplantation allows us to confidently save the lives of previously doomed patients. Unfortunately, this colossal achievement of human progress has a problematic side \u2013 the shortage of donor organs. The use of animal organs could solve it. Currently, the issues of xenotransplantation have become relevant again after the experimental xenotransplantation of the kidney of a genetically modified pig in 2021, and the xenotransplantation of the heart in 2022. This practice raises a number of ethical questions. Is it ethical to put humanity at risk by saving one person? Is it ethical to limit the civil rights of a xeno-recipient? Will xenotransplantation create another reason for discrimination? Can the creation of xenochimeras be considered an unacceptable interference in the Divine plan from a religious point of view? Is it ethical to use higher animals for xenotransplantation? Will an increase in the number of xenotransplants create a risk of the identity of the human race? Will xenotransplantation create new questions about equitable organ allocation? The sources of scholars of theologians related to the main Abrahamic religions on this topic are analyzed. Consideration of theological approaches to the new ethical problems presented by xenotransplantation does not allow us to find a unanimity of opinion. However, as this new branch of medical science makes concrete clinical progress, the attitude of society, religious leaders and ordinary believers towards it will improve. From an individual point of view, Judaism does not object to xenotransplantation to prolong and save human life, even in the case of non-kosher animals with genetic modifications. The preservation of life outweighs other values almost without exception. Xenotransplantation, even from a pig, is hailed as a life-sustaining medical intervention from a Jewish ethical perspective by most authors. In Christianity, the motivation is to try to follow the example of Jesus Christ in bringing healing to all those in need. While physiological healing is important, the ultimate goal is the overall well-being of the individual, which requires spiritual, mental, and social well-being in addition to physical health. The most correct generalization about Islamic bioethical views on xenotransplantation would be that, given the state",

And, as we know from the rise of industrial agriculture and the history of animal research, human benefit usually wins. \n\nThe template I have just outlined works very well for all aspects of biotechnology including agriculture, animal research, creation of animal models of human genetic disease, and the topic at hand, xenotransplantation. In fact, xenotransplantation provides a textbook example of all of the above categories. Approximately 3500 to 4000 people seek heart transplants per year in the U.S. As a result, alternatives to human donors have been sought. One putatively plausible alternative has been to use animals, specifically pigs, although historically baboons and other animals have been utilized. There are no cases reported of humans surviving with pig hearts. \n\nConsider the use of pig hearts for people needing heart transplants. (This is overwhelmingly the primary use of xenotransplantation that has been discussed.) There exist very real dangers in using animal organs for transplantation, specifically on microbiological, physiological, and immunological levels. There are also animal welfare issues associated with such uses, albeit subtle ones. Finally, there are extremely clear examples of bad ethics supplanting and eclipsing good ethics in discussions of xenotransplantation.",

While it provides hope for patients with irreversible organ failure, it also raises ethical, psychosocial, and regulatory issues. These issues challenge us both as human beings and in our relationship to animals and should be discussed among broader society. In order to elicit well-informed public opinion on the benefits and risks of xenotransplantation, we organized a citizens' conference. After deliberating over three weekends, the participants drafted an evaluative statement on xenotransplantation and made recommendations to scientists and policy makers. Overall, the citizen group considers the benefits of xenotransplantation to outweigh the risks, but calls for strict regulatory measures to ensure the development of a sustainable and ethically justifiable biotechnology. One hundred and ninety-five days. This is the period of time denoted for a scientific breakthrough in the field of xenotransplantation (XT) (La \u00a8ngin et al, 2018). Baboons survived for 6 months with a genetically modified pig heart. Bringing xenotransplantation to patients with the prospect of reducing the current shortage of donor organs has thus become more realistic. This success owes to significant progress regarding the immunological challenges of XT on the molecular level and by better genome editing technologies such as CRISPR-Cas9 (Sykes & Sachs, 2019). The time has come to align the necessary infrastructure of policy making, legal, and medical regulation, political administration, market interests, and public opinion. \n\nWhile these advances in XT provide hope for patients with irreversible organ failure, they also raise ethical and philosophical issues: Is it ethically acceptable to breed animals and use them as an organic spare parts stock? What does it mean anthropologically for patients to live with an animal organ or animal tissue? How shall we balance the potential benefits and risks of XT therapies, given that everyone could potentially benefit as an organ recipient, but at the same time may risk acquiring a xenogeneic infectious disease?",

This paper provides an overview of the current state of xenotransplantology, highlighting its revolutionary potential alongside the moral dilemmas it entails.\nAim of the study: The aim of this study is to assess current social, ethical, religious, and legal trends regarding the issue of xenotransplantation.\nMaterials and methods: To obtain up-to-date information concerning trends in xenotransplantation, a review of the PubMed and Google Scholar databases, along with the latest legislative reports in both Europe and Poland, was performed.\nConclusions: Firstly, the authors briefly report on the current situation concerning transplantology and the widely spread organ donor crisis. Next, the issue of species boundaries and the moral status of non-human animals is addressed. The assessment of ethical implications of utilizing animals as organ donors is examined, along with the legal acts regulating this issue. Moreover, the authors attempt to evaluate the cultural and religious differences related to this concern. Furthermore, this study discusses the allocation and distribution of xenotransplants, considering issues of justice, fairness, and access to this innovative medical technology. Lastly, the paper delves into the risks and uncertainties associated with xenotransplantation, including the possibility of cross-species disease transmission and intensified course of organ rejection disease.",

            "text": "Apart from this, there are a lot many unknown viruses that are hosted by animal species whose effects are not at all predictable [117]. Hence, the recipient should also be informed about the risks and preventions that he/she must take posttransplantation, restricting his freedom [121,122]. Further, to increase the success rate of transplants, recipients are constantly under the influence of immunosuppressant drugs, which would enhance his chances of other infections [117]. However, immunological reactions are not reported much after using dECM 3D bioprinted constructs. Additionally, one has to justify whether the amount that is being spent on xenotransplantation research for translation to clinical level is really worth, as it can help a relatively smaller group of people. Furthermore, for animal welfare, there are animal-related ethical issues which are considered important similar to human ethical issues [123]. Some groups believe that, the use of animals to fulfill human needs is strongly unethical, while few accept that if the benefits surpass the degree of suffering of animals, then there is no harm to use animal organs for saving human life [124]. Almost all the vertebrates suffer and perceive pain in a similar way [121]. Producing transgenic animals for organ transplantation also received criticism, as during this process, much more pain and suffering is imposed on animals due to multiple experiments in succession. In order to reduce the chance of viral transmissions, these transgenic animals are quarantined and kept in isolation [121]. Hence, the supports for animal welfare argue that the animals that undergo genetic engineering technique will be deprived of its natural habitat and are forced to live in a secluded place with pain and agony [117]. Will this suffering of an animal be the guarantee that its organ is successfully put into use remains as an unanswered question. Apart from ethics, religious feelings also come into play. A pig that is considered to have similar genetic and physiological traits similar to human [125] is considered unclean in many religions but is considered as a versatile model in biomedical research. On the other hand, if the benefits and safety of xenotransplantation is proven for human well-being, dealing with animal ethics could be vindicated.",

A number of the core areas of ethical concern that have been central to the discourse surrounding xenotransplantation are: the potential for xenozoonosis, public and regulatory issues, crossing of species boundaries and ensuring appropriate animal ethics. However, these must be balanced against the absolute positive gains for the overwhelming number of potential patients that can benefit from xenotransplantation when there are so many medical, financial and social issues for these patients. As can be seen in Figure 2, the balance between the negative aspects of their disease versus receiving a cure from the transplant is overwhelmingly weighted to the positive. This is because the benefits far outweigh the problems of ongoing and increasing ill health, secondary complications, invalidity and ultimately death. However, there are not enough human donor organs available for transplantation and using this single example, the case of patients suffering from type 1 diabetes, there are innumerable patients that could benefit from islet cell xenotransplantation with it being life changing and lifesaving.

            "text": "A controversial topic comprises the ethical issues involved not only in the clinical practice of transplanting human organs, but in technologies focused on relieving the organ shortage available for transplants. Here, we present a brief summary of considerations put to discussion for almost 70 years, related to the limits of \"doing good\" by avoiding harm to others. \n\nRegarding living donor organ donation, the safety of healthy people is a big concern where a balance between risk to the donor and the high possibility of a successful transplant must be taken into account [126]. Other topics under discussion are: if the altruist donor freely makes his/her decision; the possibility of receiving a reimbursement; or if it is acceptable to use hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected organs for uninfected recipients [127,128]. \n\nAlthough living donors can donate part of their liver, the shortage of organs is still a big concern. Xenotransplantation as an alternative, but brings new challenges. Clearly, this option is even more risky than orthotopic transplantation due to the high possibility of rejection and the potential emergence of a new virus and even worse, of a pandemic. However, the use of genetically modified animals in the attempt to reduce rejection rates is not exempt from ethical discussion [129,130]. In order to avoid rejection, it is possible to develop a \"humanized organ\" inside animals for later transplantation. In this case, the ethical concerns refer to the possibility, quite unlikely, of introducing human DNA into an animal embryo, and thereby compromising human dignity. \n\nAn emerging ethical concern while xenotransplantation is under experimental research is that once this procedure is established, the production of animals for this purpose, basically pigs, will be discussed in the context of life-saving benefits versus the use of animals for meat consumption. Undoubtedly, many ethical issues will be raised in the process of minimizing the risk of spreading zoonosis to humans, because everyone close to the recipient may well be subject to long-term observation, affecting their rights to privacy and confidentiality.",

Concerns about animal welfare in xenotransplantation, such as quarantining pigs in sterile environments, are deemed theologically acceptable as long as there are defined benefits for humans. The lack of voluntary giving from the source animal may raise concerns about exploitation and potential guilt for some individuals. The theology of taskh\u012br, however, overrides any theological culpability, leaving individuals to manage their own psychological responses to the practice. \n\nDespite the theology of taskhir functioning as a buffer against theological culpability, three specific issues related to xenotransplantation may cause theological tensions. Firstly, testing xenografts on brain-dead individuals conflicts with Islamic teachings on honoring the deceased and providing a swift burial. Secondly, the use of human DNA in pigs during the fetal stage for transgenesis necessitates further theological reflection on human experimentation. Lastly, the restrictions imposed on xenograft recipients regarding blood and milk donation, breastfeeding, sexual intercourse, and mandatory medication raise questions about autonomy and require an Islamic response. \n\nIn light of these theological and ethical dilemmas, some scholars argue for alternative solutions, such as synthetic models, 3D printed organs, and cloned organs from stem cells, to reduce reliance on allografts and porcine xenografts [22].",

            "text": "Despite the many advantages of xenotransplantation, there are some ethical, legal, and social aspects that must be regulated and considered. First, there are no international legal regulations for pig-to-human xenotransplantation [139]. Their establishment is one of the major milestones in the introduction of pig-to-human xenotransplantation. Apart from the lack of legal regulations, introducing xenotransplantation into clinical practice requires a discussion in the society combined with explanation of procedures and knowledge bases. There are concerns that some societies will oppose pig-to-human xenotransplantation because of religious and cultural aspects [140]. Moreover, there is a probability that the use of organs from modified pigs, in some countries, may lead to a global trend of reducing the number of human transplants for altruistic reasons [141]. At this moment, we are unable to predict the reaction of society to a person carrying an animal organ. The social acceptance and the fear of social rejection may pose a risk of a medical procedure refusal by patient. Therefore, there is a need for xenograft recipient anonymity. \n\nThe ethical aspects of xenotransplantation mainly concern the use of animals, namely pigs. Harvesting organs from these animals and transplanting them into humans will in most cases result in the death of the animal. Moreover, another aspect concerns the welfare of animals bred for xenotransplantation. These animals are likely to be kept in sterile, laboratory-like conditions. From a human standpoint, the level of care provided to these animals will be the highest. However, when we change to the animal perspective, these conditions may be worse than in agricultural breeding. This type of approach is anthropocentric and puts human life above that of other animal species [142]. For this reason, it is imperative to investigate all alternatives that could replace animal organs and save patients' lives before introducing pig-to-human xenotransplantation into clinical practice [143]. These alternatives so far include, but are not limited to, the use of stem cells and tissue engineering [144]. Thus far, no alternative has been found that would be able to fully replace the functionality of the human organ.",

Advances in gene editing, including CRISPR technology, have reduced the risk of hyperacute rejection, bringing xenotransplantation closer to clinical application [49]. If successful, xenotransplantation could dramatically expand the organ pool, reducing the need for both deceased and live donors. \n\nHowever, several challenges remain before xenotransplantation can become a routine clinical practice. Concerns about zoonotic disease transmission, long-term immunological compatibility, and ethical questions surrounding the use of animal organs in humans must be addressed. Regulatory frameworks are still developing, and more data are needed to assess the long-term viability and safety of xenotransplanted organs. Despite these hurdles, xenotransplantation has the potential to fundamentally alter LT, providing organs to patients who might otherwise be excluded due to organ shortages.",

While there is a high demand for human tissues, cells, and organs for use in clinical transplantation, they are often in short supply. Recent scientific and biotechnological advancements, coupled with the scarcity of human allografts, have led to renewed interest in developing exploratory treatment strategies that use xenotransplantation products in human recipients. However, despite its potential benefits, the use of xenotransplantation is still limited due to various considerations, as discussed in this review of the past, present, and future directions of xenotransplantation. One of the key ethical concerns surrounding xenotransplantation is the potential impact on the animals from which the cells, tissues, or organs are obtained. As with genetic modification to fix genetic defects or prevent disease, the ideal outcome for these animals is that they will be better off as a result of the change. However, unless there are major changes in the way science is taught to incorporate ethics into recognized scientific theory and practice, these concerns will not be adequately addressed",

            "text": "Xenotransplantation has shown considerable promise in earlystage studies, bridging a critical gap between theoretical potential and practical clinical application (31). This transition from laboratory success to real-world efficacy underscores the importance of preclinical research as an essential step. This phase serves not only to validate findings from controlled laboratory settings in more clinically relevant scenarios but also to identify unforeseen challenges that may not be apparent in initial studies. The intricate dance between clinical application and laboratory research is informed by these challenges, directing the trajectory of future investigations. The exploration of genetically engineered pigs, particularly those modified with multiple genes, marks a significant advancement in this field (3). However, delving deeper into the specific functions of these genetic modifications and the discovery of new xenoantigens remain critical areas for further research. The protracted process of breeding these genetically altered pigs also poses a logistical challenge, emphasizing the need for streamlining breeding techniques to enhance research efficiency. \n\nThe ethical considerations surrounding the selection of participants for clinical trials, especially the inclusion of end-stage renal disease patients or those not eligible for conventional transplants, continue to provoke debate. Alternatively, the use of brain-dead individuals in preclinical studies presents a less contentious pathway, aligning with both ethical standards and research needs. Meanwhile, the quest for optimal immunosuppression strategies remains ongoing, with the current regimens requiring refinement to improve outcomes and reduce adverse effects. The consistency in selecting donor genotypes and standardizing perioperative care protocols also presents a significant hurdle, mirroring the complexity of translating xenotransplantation into a clinically viable option. Persistent issues such as graft rejection, inflammation, coagulation disorders, maintaining the physiological function of transplanted kidneys, and managing the risk of viral transmission underscore the multifaceted challenges ahead. \n\nAs preclinical research progresses, it is imperative to tackle these obstacles head-on, paving the way for the successful integration of xenotransplantation into clinical practice. The future of this innovative field hinges on our ability to navigate these complexities, requiring a concerted effort from researchers, clinicians, and ethicists alike.",

            "text": "Discussion about the ethics of xenotransplantation from the 1990s and early 2000s evolved as the science advanced. Initial concerns centered on whether animal-to-human transplants violate the laws of nature and whether it is wrong to sacrifice animals as organ donors to humans. Some feared social injustice by lopsided distribution of scarce resources to a few at the expense of broader basic medical care for all. Critics wondered whether xenotransplantation would endanger public health [7]. Other pressing questions touched on prerequisites for clinical trials: identifying acceptable risk-benefit thresholds and clinically defining success (extra days versus extra weeks or months of life, for example). Some questioned whether informed consent should be obtained from close contacts of the patient and medical personnel involved in the recipient's care, given concerns about zoonotic infection. It was argued that informed consent from recipients should include a broader set of risks including public attention, risk of transmitting disease and isolation. A final set of questions touched on who is responsible for oversight of clinical trials in xenotransplantation (local hospital review boards, national committees, or some combination)? \n\nEthicists and researchers considered the role of local institutional review boards (IRB) in approving xenotransplant clinical trials [8]. They argued that IRB members, particularly community members who may not have scientific or medical knowledge, would need ongoing education about xenotransplantation. They cited the model of the National Institutes of Health's Re-combinant DNA Advisory Committee, which focused initially on public fears about gene transfer but ultimately provided a public forum to discuss broader issues of gene transfer. IRBs would have to confront the inability of a subject to withdraw from a study once the xenotransplant had been made. In addition to ongoing training, the authors recommend that IRBs bring in nonvoting consultants to help them reach a decision, as well as involve hospital ethics committees in an advisory role, particularly for the ethical concerns of the post-transplant period. \n\nScholars have looked at societal and religious attitudes toward xenotransplantation, convening focus groups of local religious leaders, organ procurement organizations' staff, patients who need or have already received a transplant and local members of the business community [9].",

            "text": "Xenotransplantation is the process of transplanting organs, tissues, or cells from one species into another species, most commonly into humans. The primary goal of xenotransplantation is to address the shortage of human donor organs and potentially provide a more readily available source of organs for transplantation [1]. \n\nThe process goes through various phases. First, animal donors are chosen on the basis of suitability of their organs being of similar in size and function to human organs; originally baboons and other non-human primates were used, since the 1980s pigs have been preferred in this endeavor. Second, donor animals are genetically modified to reduce the risk of immune rejection and transmission of diseases from animals to humans (xenozoonosis), donor animals are genetically modified [2]. This can involve removing or modifying specific genes responsible for producing antigens that are recognized by the human immune system. This process is known as \"humanization\" of the animal's organs. Even with genetic modifications, the human recipient's immune system can still recognize animal tissues as foreign and trigger a rejection response. To prevent this, recipients receive immunosuppressive drugs to dampen their immune response, similar to what is done in human-to-human organ transplantation [3]. \n\nThird, the donor animal organ, which has been genetically modified, is surgically transplanted into the human recipient. The specific surgical procedure varies depending on the organ being transplanted [4]. Fourth, after transplantation, the recipient is closely monitored for any signs of rejection or complications. Regular medical check-ups and immunosuppressive drug therapy adjustments may be necessary to maintain the viability of the transplanted organ [5]. \n\nWhile xenotransplantation is a promising alternative, some challenges remain. For example, immune rejection is still a problem, and there is a potential risk of transmitting animal viruses to humans, which must be carefully managed and monitored. Perhaps the bestknown case was that of Baby Fae, who died a few weeks later after receiving a baboon's organ, largely due to immunological complications [6]. This suggests that with xenotransplantation, there are concerns about the need for lifelong surveillance of patients after receiving the organ. \n\nOther concerns are ethical.",

Nevertheless, both preclinical and clinical investigations conducted thorough pathogen screening to exclude prevalent viruses in pig donors, such as PERV-3 and PCMV. The posttransplantation virus detection in the decedents also remained negative (12,27) However, the limitations of these negative findings are underscored by the relatively short observation periods. Consequently, developing future strategies to detect and eliminate these viruses is imperative to uphold the safety of both the graft and the recipient (28). \n\nAdditionally, the ethical landscape of xenotransplantation, encompassing animal rights, public attitudes, and regulatory milestones such as the FDA's 2022 approval of a pig-to-human heart transplant, presents ongoing challenges (29). The pilot xenotransplantation trials have underscored various ethical and medicolegal considerations inherent in xenotransplantation research (12,18). In these studies, brain-dead decedents were precluded from organ donation, and obtaining proper informed consent from their families was deemed essential. Notably, the absence of specific legislation governing xenotransplantation necessitates evolution of the regulatory frameworks to enhance research protocols and future clinical applications. Consultation with ethics committees is imperative to ensure adherence to established guidelines such as the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act (UAGA) and the dead-donor rule, while also acknowledging the cultural and religious nuances surrounding organ transplantation (30). Public acceptance and ethical considerations remain integral to the advancement and clinical application of xenotransplantation, highlighting the need for continued research, dialogue, and education in this evolving field. \n\nIn summary, xenotransplantation's journey towards becoming a viable clinical option is fraught with complex immunological, physiological, virological, and ethical challenges.",

However, the graft failed, and the patient died 60 days after the procedure. The ethical issues relating to xenotransplantation include the risk/benefit to the individual, the risk of porcine-derived infectious agents crossing into humans, animal welfare and rights, issues of human and animal identity and concerns relating to fair allocation of organs and appropriate use of resources. These ethical issues are often addressed using emotional arguments, or through consequentialist or deontological lens. An alternative is to use approaches based on virtue ethics to understand the moral purpose (telos) of the research and the virtues (character traits) needed to be a good research clinician. In this review we will consider the virtues of justice, courage, temperance and practical wisdom, as well as the role of clinical curiosity, and their application to xenotransplantation.

This meticulous genetic engineering aims to produce organs that are not only less likely to be rejected but also capable of performing their physiological functions without inducing harmful side effects in the recipient. \n\nThe continuous exploration and refinement of these genetic modifications underscore the complexity of making xenotransplantation a viable clinical option. As researchers dive deeper into the genetic underpinnings of immune rejection and organ compatibility, xenotransplantation alleviating the organ shortage crisis is coming true. Yet, it is essential to balance the enthusiasm for these technological advances with a careful assessment of their long-term implications for both organ recipients and the broader field of transplantation medicine. \n\nFuture research must also address the ethical considerations and regulatory challenges associated with xenotransplantation. As genetic engineering techniques become more sophisticated, consensus of the moral, ethical, and societal implications of using genetically modified animals for organ transplantation must be reached. Those topics warranting immediate attention includes animal welfare, the potential impact on natural ecosystems, and the long-term health outcomes for transplant recipients. Moreover, as the field progresses towards potential clinical applications, establishing clear and comprehensive regulatory frameworks will be crucial to ensuring the safety, efficacy, and ethical integrity of organ xenotransplantation. \n\nWhile the genetic engineering of pigs for kidney xenotransplantation represents a frontier of medical science with the potential to dramatically expand the organ donor pool, it also poses a myriad of scientific, ethical, and regulatory challenges.",

            "text": "One ethical concern intrinsic to xenotransplantation relates to the potential for the transmission of diseases from animals to humans, a phenomenon known as xenozoonosis. The concept of transmission although theoretical is not unfounded, as various pathogens, including retroviruses, have been identified in pigs could be potential threats in immunocompromised transplant recipients and then theoretically spread to direct close contacts and the broader community (24,25). \n\nAs such this raises potential ethical dilemmas. The duty to protect the broader community and prevent the spread of theoretically potential infectious diseases must be weighed against the need to explore novel medical solutions to help these patients suffering from end stage organ failure and other diseases (6). The possibility of creating animals free from such pathogens as porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERV) through genetic engineering (26) has already been shown to be possible along with raising donor animals in designated pathogen free (DPF) facilities. Along with pigs that have limited pathogens including restricted PERV (27) or where studies have shown no potential for transmission (28, 29). Despite best intensions and even following screening of donor animals we have seen that donor pig organs can still potentially have undetectable porcine viruses such as cytomegalovirus or porcine roseolovirus (PCMV/PRV) detected posttransplant in the donor tissue by plasma microbial cell-free DNA (30). This occurred despite pre-transplant screening and following transplantation into a patient (25). \n\nFrom a patient and community perspective it is therefore essential for the patients, their family and immediate direct contacts along with the community to understand that if there were in fact a positive case of transmission of a xenozoonosis into a xenotransplant patient that there may well be serious implications to all involved. These implications are potentially as severe as lifelong restriction and quarantine of the recipient and may extend to their direct close contacts (25).",

Due to the current shortage of available donor organs for transplantation, many alternative sources are being examined to solve the donor shortage. One of them is xenotransplantation which refers to the transplantation of organs from one species to another. Compared to other nonhuman primates (NHP), pigs are ideal species for organ harvesting as they rapidly grow to human size in a handful of months. There is much advancement in the genetic engineering of pigs, which have hearts structurally and functionally similar to the human heart. The role of genetic engineering is to overcome the immune barriers in xenotransplantation and can be used in hyperacute rejection and T cell-mediated rejection. It is technically difficult to use large animal models for orthotopic, life-sustaining heart transplantation. Despite the fact that some religious traditions, such as Jewish and Muslim, prohibit the ingestion of pork products, few religious leaders consider that donating porcine organs is ethical because it saves human life. Although recent technologies have lowered the risk of a xenograft producing a novel virus that causes an epidemic, the risk still exists. It has major implications for the informed consent procedure connected with clinical research on heart xenotransplantation.",

            "text": "The legislative landscape for xenotransplantation has evolved significantly over the years. As science has advanced, the regulations have been adapted to keep pace with the changing landscape in transplantation but it still lacks the oversight and ability to completely control all that occurs. Despite the best policies and guidance's more universal legislation is required to outlaw and prevent organ trafficking and ongoing issues associated with unscrupulous operators (44). The early years of xenotransplantation were characterized by limited regulatory oversight and fragmented approaches to the management of potential risks due to limited legislation to this new field. However, significant oversight was established early on by the WHO, TTS and IXA to ensure there were guidance's developed to underpin the field (2-4). \n\nHowever, high-profile setbacks and scientific developments have prompted a revaluation of regulatory frameworks. An example of this was the identification of porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) which raised concerns by government legislators about the potential transmission of these retroviruses to immunocompromised transplant recipients (45). As a result, several jurisdictions-initiated moratorium preventing any clinical xenotransplantation trials from commencing and as such a stronger focus was placed on the assessment and management of this risk in regulatory guidelines (46). \n\nRecently, regulatory bodies have intensified their efforts to provide comprehensive guidelines for xenotransplantation, reflecting a growing recognition of the field's incredible potential with a balance against the risks. Some guidance's such as from the USA FDA have addressed issues such as genetic modifications in source animals, monitoring for infectious agents, and the ethical treatment of donor animals (42). And the USA government and other jurisdictions legislating and licensing biological products such as xenografts, tissues and cells under specific biological products legislation (47).",

            "text": "The demand for transplant organs far outstrips the supply, forcing thousands of patients to face the possibility that they will die before a compatible organ becomes available. This shortage is particularly acute in patients needing a kidney, where the average wait time for a deceased donor is 5 years (1). The Department of Health and Human Service's Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network data reported that an average of 20 Americans die each day awaiting transplant. In 2018, 11 of those deaths were while waiting for a kidney. Additionally, 12 people per day were removed from the kidney transplant waiting list because they were deemed too sick to undergo the rigors of surgery (2).\n\nXenotransplantation (XTx) may be an option in addressing the organ shortage. Recent advances in genetic modification of pigs have demonstrated recipient survival in excess of a year (3). Despite their life-saving potential, the use of animal tissues in humans creates religious, ethical, and psychosocial considerations for all involved parties (4). To begin addressing these, directives from the World Health Organization, the Food and Drug Administration, and the International XTx Association all call for public involvement and transparency in evaluating the ethics and risks of XTx (5)(6)(7).\n\nGauging public attitudes toward cross-species transplantation is a necessary component to preparing for, and preemptively addressing, concerns should XTx become a clinical reality. Potential ethical considerations for society include religious objections specific to porcine tissues, animal rights, and individual fears of XTx violating the very idea of \"personhood\" (8). However, there is a lack of studies that capture the perceptions of the other major stakeholders regarding the issue of transplant organ supply from the health care providers themselves (9). The purpose of this study was to identify attitudes, perceptions, and beliefs to XTx between different stakeholders in the renal community, who will ultimately be involved in the clinical uptake and/or care of individuals who receive a xenograft.",

            "text": "Likewise, secularization in most contexts (including Egypt) has been associated with higher educational [83][84][85] and socio-economic levels [86,87]. However, in this study, neither of those variables predict moral approval of xenotransplantation. \n\nIt is important to consider that, while religious identity is a factor in predicting the moral approval of xenotransplantation, attitudes towards animals (as measured by the BMAAS) are also a factor, albeit in a lower capacity. Indeed, as per the regression model of this study, greater attitudes of respect towards animals predict lower moral approval of xenotransplantation. This is expected, as the prospect of xenotransplantation raises concern about the welfare of animals. The genetic modification of animals for xenotransplantation purposes can involve altering their physiology to reduce the risk of organ rejection in humans; this may have a potential impact on the health and natural behaviour of the animals. Since xenotransplantation involves the sacrifice of animals for the benefit of humans, people who feel more empathy towards animals would likely oppose xenotransplantation. Subjects with a more elevated sense of the need for animal welfare would contend that animals should not be treated as mere resources for human use and that their interests, including their right to live free from unnecessary harm, should be respected. \n\nWhile Egypt has not been traditionally at the forefront of animal rights activism, movements have been on the rise in recent years [88], and there have been some governmental initiatives in this regard [89]. Consequently, although not to the same level as religious identity, animal welfare concerns are a predictive factor of moral approval of xenotransplantation, and policymakers and researchers seeking to establish a firmer hold of xenotransplantation in this nation, need to seriously consider ways of ensuring greater measures of animal welfare in xenotransplantation procedures, to persuade people to morally approve of this technology. \n\nHowever, it is important not to overestimate the role of religious identity or attitudes towards animals (as measured by the BMAAS) in the moral approval of xenotransplantation.",

            "text": "We also aim to apply lessons learned through historical analysis to reveal bioethical concerns that are critically underdiscussed. Organ transplantation appears poised on the precipice of spectacular, paradigmatic change. However, little has been done to show that xenotransplantation will not also fall victim to the issues currently troubling traditional organ transplantation. Without this analysis, researchers, physicians, and patients may adopt ostensible solutions plagued by the same problems they were meant to solve. If the set of reasons concerning why so many would-be transplant recipients suffer and die are connected to a broader network of social and cultural considerations, it would follow that simply replacing human donors with nonhuman donors would fail to rectify the many problems within today's transplant practices. \n\nUsing the current shortfalls of traditional organ transplantation as a justification for shifting to xenotransplantation leaves us vulnerable to repeating past mistakes, particularly when we discover that the rhetoric around xenotransplantation research today paints an alarmingly optimistic, solutionoriented picture. Moreover, xenotransplantation has not yet engaged with a number of critical ethical issues, such as how human subjects will be used as the proving ground for this therapy. Broad and thorough bioethical outlining can protect against a similar fate befalling xenotransplantation practice in the future. In other words, if we work to synergize historical and bioethical perspectives today, we may generate positive downstream effects on researchers, patients, and non-human animals within a new biomedical system of relationships and practices. \n\nOne tool at our disposal for generating these positive effects is bioethics, one of the most important institutions in biomedical research for helping to orchestrate, buffer, and rebuff the complex web of interactions guiding medical research. This system includes a robust legal framework guiding research and protecting patients, a governing and review body present at most research institutions, and an informal network of academics, scientists, lawyers, researchers, theologians, philosophers, and, indeed, the public itself. All individuals and groups involved are tasked with protecting the most vulnerable in society while biomedical research continues to seek new heights in knowledge and understanding. \n\nNevertheless, bioethics was born in response to history.",

The review begins with genetic modifications enhancing pig hearts for human transplantation, navigating through immunological challenges, rejection mechanisms, and immune responses. Key areas include preclinical milestones, complement cascade roles, and genetic engineering to address hyperacute rejection. Physiological counterbalance systems, like human thrombomodulin and endothelial protein C receptor upregulation in porcine xenografts, highlight efforts for graft survival enhancement. Evaluating pig and baboon donors and challenges with non-human primates illuminates complexities in donor species selection. Ethical considerations, encompassing animal rights, welfare, and zoonotic disease risks, are critically examined in the cXT context. The review delves into immune control mechanisms with aggressive immunosuppression and clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) technology, elucidating hyperacute rejection, complement activation, and antibody-mediated rejection intricacies. CRISPR/Cas9\u2019s role in creating pig endothelial cells expressing human inhibitor molecules is explored for rejection mitigation. Ethical and regulatory aspects emphasize the role of committees and international guidelines. A forward-looking perspective envisions precision medical genetics, artificial intelligence, and individualized heart cultivation within pigs as transformative elements in cXT\u2019s future is also explored. This comprehensive analysis offers insights for researchers, clinicians, and policymakers, addressing the current state, and future prospects of cXT.",

            "text": "One of the most pressing ethical dilemmas in xenotransplantation is the selection of patients for clinical trials. Current recommendations prioritize critically ill patients who have exhausted all other therapeutic options. However, this approach has been criticized for its potential to produce unfavorable risk-benefit ratios, particularly for patients with complex medical conditions. Furthermore, concerns about justice and beneficence arise when considering acutely ill patients who may struggle to provide fully informed consent [19]. \n\nCardiac xenotransplantation is also actively being explored for pediatric patients-a population in which few therapeutic options exist at all. Successful xenotransplantation could represent a bridge to allotransplantation or a potential long-term solution for this vulnerable population. Genetically modified pig hearts offer considerable promise in alleviating growing waitlists and reducing high mortality rates among pediatric patients [20]. However, the ethical challenges surrounding pediatric xenotransplantation are complex. Issues such as informed consent-particularly for minors-and the psychosocial impacts on patients and their families further complicate the discourse. Public perception adds another layer of difficulty, especially when determining whether adults or children should be prioritized in early clinical trials. Efforts to address these challenges include developing transparent patient selection frameworks prioritizing medical need, equitable access, and rigorous informed consent processes, particularly for vulnerable groups such as pediatric patients [21]. By integrating these considerations, the field can progress in a way that balances innovation with justice and beneficence",

            "text": "Embodied in the wider concepts of informed consent are considerations that young people and the old or infirm are not exploited. Peoples with poor understanding of the language and scientific concepts involved are not to be misled. Religious and cultural feelings are not to be disregarded in potential recipients who find it difficult to express their reluctance to participate in the presence of those whom they perceive as medical authorities. \n\nThe ethical issues of xenotransplantation include concerns over the cultural, ethical and spiritual dimensions of xenotransplantation; the ethical acceptability of using animals to provide tissue for human transplantation; how the welfare of donor animals can be adequately protected and their suffering reduced; and how the welfare and interests of patients in early clinical xenotransplantation trials can be protected. These issues have been addressed by the Nuffield Council on Bioethics in the United Kingdom (1996) and, in New Zealand, the Bioethics Council, Toi te Taiao (2005). The latter body concluded that prohibition of xenotransplantation could not be justified, given the compelling human need argument, and that it should be allowed to develop in New Zealand, with that development being demonstrably shaped by the resolution and management of safety issues by a competent authority; the relationship between the majority European culture and indigenous Maori people and the cultural, ethical and spiritual factors that matter to most New Zealanders. \n\nIn recent years, a number of recommendations to protect the ethical integrity of future human research have been made by various regulatory authorities. Key issues in the conduct of clinical trials of xenotransplantation include the requirement to provide patients with an explanation of the likely success, its attendant risks, and the subsequent quality-oflife that can be expected when obtaining their informed consent, and informing patients that their consent to the procedure includes consent to ongoing post-transplantation microbiological monitoring. \n\nOther international spiritual organisations have given their opinions about xenotransplantation. The Vatican in Rome, Italy have considered xenotransplantation in some depth and suggest it is worthy of serious consideration (Vatican, 2011). Jewish organisations have given qualified support to xenotransplantation as a life enhancing procedure while Muslim opinion is unclear but has generally been negative because of the status of pigs in the religious context.",

            "text": "With decades of pre\u2010clinical studies culminating in the recent clinical application of xenotransplantation, it would appear timely to provide recommendations for operationalizing oversight of xenotransplantation clinical trials. Ethical issues with clinical xenotransplantation have been described for decades, largely centering on animal welfare, the risks posed to the recipient, and public health risks posed by potential spread of xenozoonosis. Much less attention has been given to considerations relating to potentially elevated risks faced by those who may care for or otherwise have close contact with xenograft recipients. This paper examines the ethical and logistical issues raised by the potential exposure to xenozoonotic disease faced by close contacts of xenotransplant recipients\u2014defined herein as including but not limited to caregivers, household contacts, and sexual partners\u2014which warrants special attention given their increased risk of exposure to infection compared to the general public. We discuss implications of assent or consent by these close contacts to potentially undergo, along with the recipient, procedures for infection screening and possible quarantine. We then propose several options and recommendations for operationalizing oversight of xenotransplantation clinical trials that could account for and address close contacts\u2019 education on and agency regarding the risk of xenozoonosis.",

            "text": "This study indicates that people's views on xenotransplantation in Egypt are not dramatically different from those held in other countries [39][40][41][42]. While the benefits of xenotransplantation are appreciated, there may still be some ethical concerns, and this is reflected in the overall moral approval rate. The results of the present study suggest that moral opinions about this issue are roughly evenly distributed, suggesting that it is a complicated moral matter. \n\nThe prospect of xenotransplantation makes some people uneasy, given that it raises ethical questions about the boundaries between species [43][44][45][46][47]. This concern typically has various dimensions. First, there is the issue of human exceptionalism. Many philosophical and religious traditions emphasize the unique status of humans. The idea of human exceptionalism asserts that humans possess a distinct moral, intellectual, or spiritual essence that sets them apart from other species. The crossing of species boundaries, such as through genetic engineering or xenotransplantation, challenges this perception and raises ethical questions about the manipulation of fundamental aspects of life. Ethical frameworks often draw on distinctions between species to guide moral decisionmaking. Some individuals believe that certain rights and responsibilities are exclusive to humans, based on perceived moral or cognitive differences. The blurring of species boundaries, as in the case of xenotransplantation, can provoke ethical dilemmas for those who hold such beliefs. Some authors call this the \"xenotransplantation paradox. \" Gill Haddow defines it as the tension in thinking that \"although non-human animals and humans are thought to be biologically compatible or similar, many assume and emphasise just how different we are from  human and what is a non-human animal and yet how shallow the socially constructed division between the species is\" [48]. From a moral psychology perspective, xenotransplantation elicits cognitive discomfort in many people, to the extent that animals used as donors must be sufficiently close to humans (for purposes of anatomical and physiological compatibility, etc.), yet sufficiently distant to not be disturbed by their exploitative use.",

Clinical application of innovation such as xenotransplantation raises questions concerning the balance between beneficence, individual autonomy and the recognition of possible damage to society and the environment. 18,19 The problems of autonomy in xenotransplantation are related to the difficulty of composing the free and informed consent form, since the risks and benefits for the recipient, given the complexity of the situation, are still unknown. Furthermore, some of the greatest risks of this procedure, zoonosis, is associated with the possibility of its success. Therefore, the recipient's notion of being able to withdraw from participating in the research at any time must be very well clarified before proceeding with the xenotransplantation, if there is a predictable chance of survival for a long period. 18,19 he risk of xenotransplant recipients contracting and transmitting Porcine Endogenous Retroviruses (PERV) infections is another bioethical issue that represents a potential public health problem because could cause a pandemic.

            "text": "Jaboulay used the vascular technique to transplant a pig kidney onto the brachial artery and cephalic vein of a 48-yr-old woman. Immediately and for the first day and a half he saw significant urine output, but on the third day, he was forced to remove the kidney because of vascular thrombosis (17). Sadly, a lack of understanding of immunology, hematology and any of the intricacies of transplantation, let alone the issues of cross-species xenotransplantation prevented any chance of longerterm success. These early attempts were characterized by a lack of ethical and scientific groundwork, and the risks and consequences of such procedures were often not well understood. \n\nThe ensuing centuries saw sporadic and largely unsuccessful attempts at xenotransplantation, with frequent instances of graft rejection and infections that further tempered enthusiasm for the field (18-20). Moreover, as medical ethics evolved and animal welfare concerns gained prominence, the scientific community was challenged to grapple with the significant ethical implications of these procedures, especially when it came to the use of animals involved in the pre-clinical trials and as a source of organs, tissues and cells for transplantation into humans (6). \n\nIn the latter half of the 20th century, with the advent of organ transplantation and the increasing demand for donor organs, the potential of xenotransplantation was revisited with renewed enthusiasm pushing the field forward. The discovery of alpha Gal as the mechanism responsible for causing hyperacute rejection (HAR) (21) and the concept of utilizing specifically designed genetically modified pigs (9,13,22), capable of providing organs less immunogenic to the human immune system, marked a significant turning point in xenotransplantation's history. These developments paved the way for the initiation of initial clinical trials involving xeno-kidneys and soon to be islet cell xenotransplants. \n\nAs we explore the ethical and legislative advances propelling xenotransplantation toward clinical translation, we must acknowledge the lessons of history. The historical backdrop of early, less-informed attempts, coupled with ethical concerns, has played an instrumental role in shaping the ethical and legislative frameworks we see today (23).",

Xenotransplantation also encompasses anthropology, sociology, and ethics, all of which may have significant impacts on our society, hence we must proceed with caution.\n\nThe experiences in allogeneic organ transplantation have shown that recipients have the belief that they have acquired qualities or adopted traits from the donors after transplantation [24,25].Therefore, human xenotransplantation might bring ethical dilemmas pertaining to personal identity and human dignity, which need to be cautiously evaluated in the process of preparation for clinical trial.\n\nIn 2008 and 2018, in Changsha China, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Xenotransplantation Association (IXA) developed and updated the WHO regulation for xenotransplantation clinical trials (the Changsha Communiqu\u00e9) with the participation of the Chinese transplant community [26,27].The Changsha Communiqu\u00e9 indicated that the Chinese transplant professionals held the ethical and legal issues associated with xenotransplantation in high regard.",

            "text": "For example, a member of the xenotransplantation team outlined the \"ethical algorithm\" at use during the xenoheart's development and eventual transplant. The clinician-scientist in question, Martine Rothblatt 28 , reassured readers in a commentary published in Xenotransplantation that a balance was struck between the \"public's concern not to face a new pandemic\" with the \"patient's concern not to die from their disease.\" The ethical dilemma, as perceived by the xenotransplantation team, was primarily concerned with how to \"comply with infection control procedures,\" diminish the \"possibility of transmissible pathogens,\" a \"commitment to biosurveillance,\" and \"humane care practices\" 28 for the donor pigs. In other words, an ethical algorithm that intended to balance the desire to break new grounds in xenotransplantation science with the all-too-real fear of zoonotic spillover. It should come as no surprise that many of the ethical considerations at the forefront of the biomedical team are, in a sense, deeply rooted in pragmatic scientific considerations. \n\nThe immunological response has been one of the most significant stumbling blocks for replacing solid organ transplantation with xenotransplantation. Current studies often utilize genetically modified porcine donor organs that lack the alpha-1,3-galactosyltransferase gene (\"alpha Gal\"), which is thought to prevent hyperacute rejection of the transplanted non-human organ as well as acute vascular rejection events 34 . However, it is not just the knockout of alpha-Gal which may need to occur to prevent rejection. Some studies are exploring the combined effect of alpha-Gal knockouts and randomly inserted human alpha 1,2-fucosylosyltransferase (HT) transgene in the hopes that the addition of the human HT gene will produce better results than just the null porcine line 34 . These alterations and research lines refer to the porcine donor's genetic makeup. This work does not touch on the pharmaceutical course and immunological therapies that need to be developed or altered to prepare human and animal donors for transplantation.",

            "text": "The history of xenotransplantation is peppered with optimistic predictions about its imminence and feasibility. In 1969, the Nobel winning transplant immunologist Peter Medawar hypothesised that We should solve the problem [of organ transplantation] by using heterografts [xenografts]  one day if we try hard enough, and maybe in less than 15 years. 1 More than 20 years later, the Nuffield Council on Bioethics predicted that the first pig to human xenotransplants would be performed in 1996. 2 What followed was almost 30 more years of intense research focused on the remaining immunological and infectious challenges. However, in 2022, xenotransplantation was thrust back into mainstream transplant discourse following two significant developments. First were the reports of two genetically engineered (GE) pig kidneys transplanted into deceased human recipients, mechanically maintained after death by neurological criteria (decedents). 3 4 6][7] This resurgence of activity, in the shadow of the COVID-19 pandemic, comes at a time when public and professional anxieties about zoonoses, public health and experimental treatments are all running high. \n\nIt was on this background that in late 2022 King's College London, with endorsement from the British Transplant Society, and the European Society of Organ Transplantation, brought together a group of experts in xenotransplantation science, ethics and law. This symposium, the first of its kind in the UK for 20 years, aimed to discuss the ethical, regulatory, and technical challenges surrounding translating xenotransplantation into the clinical setting. First, a series of three lectures showcased the progress which has been made in xenotransplantation including-the history of xenotransplantation, advances in gene edited animals and preclinical research activities. Following these were sessions introducing ethical and legal concerns. Finally, a roundtable discussion was held. This paper follows this structure first summarising the content of the expert lectures. Then, we report on the broad themes identified in the ethical and legal sessions and the third and final section reflects on the roundtable discussion, highlighting areas of consensus and controversy.",

            "text": "In terms of the non-human animals involved, the ethical focus is often restricted to comparing the relatively small number of pigs used for research with the much larger numbers of animals farmed for meat production. While using animals as a source of 'spare parts' for humans may align with an anthropocentric worldview, it is essential to insist that the frequently made assumption-that using animals to save human lives is acceptable when people also consume them for pleasureis not uncontested (Koplin 2020). From a biocentric perspective, which underlies animal rights activism, dietary choices such as vegetarianism and veganism, both of which are gaining prominence, particularly in countries where xenotransplantation research is conducted, may influence public perception and acceptance. \n\nIt is crucial to note that using animals in xenotransplantation does not equate the life of one pig to the life of one human (Baban et al 2023). In the production process of genetically engineered pigs, less than 1% mature into animals (Entwistle et al 2022), and on the path to clinical implementation in humans, a range of non-human primates, who have been used as proxies, will have perished during preclinical trials. In addition, for porcine islet cell xenotransplants, 10 adult or more than 90 juvenile pigs would be required for one person (Coe et al 2020). Clearly, the number of animals needed for experimental and clinical xenotransplantation is significant. \n\nThe acceptability of animal use for human purposes constitutes one aspect of the 'xenotransplantation paradox' (Haddow 2021a) which involves the simultaneous emphasis on sameness and difference between humans and animals in xenotransplantation discourse (Brown 1999;Cook 2006Cook , 2013;;Hansson 2011;Sharp 2011). The emphasis on similarity across species, as opposed to differences, serves to underscore the feasibility of xenotransplantation. From this framing, physiological differences are not seen as insurmountable barriers. For example, the heart is held to be merely a pump that can function in biological organisms regardless of their species-bound specificity.",

The principle of necessity (darura) is often invoked, suggesting that actions typically deemed impermissible can become acceptable if they are essential to preserve life. Sanctity of life is a top priority (Quran: 5:32) and so is human dignity. Besides, the transplanted organs gain taharat (purity) over time which allows the recipient to perform all religious obligations without any concerns. \n\nShia jurisprudence places significant emphasis on the treatment of Scholars often discuss the ethical implications of using animals for organ transplantation, considering their rights and welfare. The ethical treatment of donor animals is a critical factor in the permissibility of xenotransplantation. Concerns about the transmission of zoonotic diseases (diseases that can be transmitted from animals to humans) are also a point of consideration. \n\nIn conclusion, Shia views on xenotransplantation are nuanced and multifaceted, considering the ethical, medical, and social implications.

            "text": "In our eagerness to press on toward new territories in medicine, it is important to consider the moral and ethical aspects of any new therapeutic approach. With regard to xenotransplantation, several issues must be considered and, indeed, have been previously reviewed by several aut h o r~.~~-*~ As in many other attempts to take great leaps in medicine, the moral and ethical views of the general public may differ from those in the medical field. Indeed, therapeutic xenotransplantation has the potential to evoke a great deal of controversy. Thus, public opinion must be carefully considered since, if antagonistic, it has the potential to prevent clinical implementation. Ethical concerns include those relating to animal welfare and animal rights, as well as the rights of the individual patient and of the community. Particular aspects that require consideration include the appropriate timing of the initial clinical trial of cardiac xenotransplantation, the selection of the first patients, and the abilityto obtain fully-informed consent from them and their families.\n\nPerhaps because approximately 100 million pigs are slain each year in the United States for food,84 research using pigs evokes less public opposition than that using nonhuman primates or even dogs. This, coupled with the fact that pig heart valves have been used therapeutically in the medical arena for several years, suggests that there may be general public acceptance to the use of pigs as a source of organs.\n\nThe major ethical concern is probably the potential risk of infection to the population at large. Before clinical trials proceed, sufficient evidence must be gathered to ensure that the welfare of the community is not jeopardized for the sake of what will initially be a very small number of sick patients. The anticipated benefit to the patient must be carefully weighed against the potential risk to the community. It is this potential risk to the community that mandates that all clinical trials are carried out under the authority of a body or organization which has powers to allow or discontinue the trial, and ensure that the necessary specimens are taken from the source pig and human recipient for storage for later study if necessary. Local institutional review boards do not have the wide expertise nor the powers necessary to perform this role.\n\nThe control of such trials should therefore be at a national or even international level.\n\nIf genetically-engineered pigs are to be produced, it is",

This leads to a conflict among those with animal welfare concerns because the need to raise a xenograftdonor pig in a sterile environment to protect the recipient is in direct conflict with the pig's natural instincts and needs. The degree of influence of both sides of this conflict has not yet been defined and warrants further exploration involving all stakeholders.\n\nAn additional source of ethical concern would be exposing the immunosuppressed patient to the possibility of zoonotic disease transmission. There are some viruses carried by pigs, particularly porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) and Nipah virus that are carried harmlessly by pigs but able to cause significant human disease as human cellular receptors for these viruses exist (88,90). A PERV is suspected to be the virus responsible for a 2009 epidemic of swine flu that led to the loss of over 250,000 human lives. The risk associated with zoonotic viruses would be amplified by posttransplant immunosuppression (3). There are also some bacteria that may potentially be transmitted by a xenograft that risk horizontal transmission across the community. This is in addition to already an increased infection risk burden that is taken on by transplant recipients because of induction and maintenance immunosuppression. This risk is substantially reduced with raising a pig intended as a xenograft donor in a dedicated sterile, biosecure environment, addressing biosafety concerns but raising the aforementioned ethical issues with regards animal welfare. Specialized molecular assays for viruses may also further reduce this risk (90). Utilizing CRISPR technology, a pig has been produced that has had all PERVs inactivated, reducing the risk of infection with PERVs that could occur with xenotransplantation and allaying this source of ethical quandary (71,90,91).\n\nLastly, public perception of scientific breakthroughs and advancement in the field of xenotransplantation raises both fascination and ethical concerns. There should be general societal involvement in the development of xenotransplant policy, but in the United States public understanding of scientific knowledge and the scientific method is lacking (88).\n\nThe field of ethics is often considered \"outside\" of the",

            "text": "One of the important ethical issues, especially in cases where a transplanted organ is from non-kin living persons, is the compensation of the loss incurred by the donor. In this regard, although it seems normal that the organ donor, in return for losing a part of his body, is entitled to remuneration, the case where a person has sold a body organ to another for money may seem very unpleasant in the opinion of many medical ethics experts as well as the general public. Some people are opposed to any purchasing and selling of organs, and they believe that this will make it very difficult for low-income people needing a transplant. Therefore, this will challenge the concept of justice in treatment, which is an important ethical principle. On the other hand, banning the purchase and sale of organs may be considered in contradiction to the health of the community, since needy people may sell their body organs due to financial problems. \n\nAnother dimension to the ethical issues surrounding organ transplantation is the transplantation of animal species to humans [59]. Organ transplantation from animal to human is justifiable and important for reasons such as the limited transfer of human organs, the long-term expectation of patients for receiving human organs, the irreversible damage or death due to the delay or lack of reception of organs and the unlimited availability of animal species [60,61]. However, this type of transplant has opponents who believe that the acceptance of animal transplantation can lead to the risk of transmission of an unknown animal-to-human disease and the inability to control and prevent the transmission of these diseases to others. Other expressed concerns oppose animal-to-human transplantation include the lack of acceptance of the patient by the community, mental illness in the patient with an animal organ in the body, and the decrease in the quality of life of the recipient as a result of these societal pressures and their religious beliefs. Therefore, ignorance of the moral, legal and social consequences of these types of transplants may result in irreparable harm; however, the use of animal organs may help supply more organ transplantations, thus reducing the harm to the recipient, while considering animal rights. \n\nTransplantation in children (as either the recipient or donor) is a particularly important ethical issue in organ transplantation [62][63][64].",

            "text": "In the first case, the animal might acquire morally relevant human traits; in the second case, the animal might transmit human genes and traits to its offspring, for example, if accidentally released into the wild. In addition, gene editing is not allowed in humans because it is associated with off-target mutations that can cause cancer and other mutations and can be passed on to a patient's descendants [7]. \n\nFor a variety of reasons, then, some find the involvement of human-pig chimeras particularly problematic. Others experience the opposite reaction. They appeal to the fact that the human component of the donor will greatly reduce the probability of organ rejection, malfunction, and ill-fitting physiology, thereby weakening the recipient-based case against xenotransplantation. They also note that gene editing permits the removal of genes associated with disease. In addition, perfecting the technique of mixing the DNA of some species with that of others will eventually enable humans not only to edit out any genes in the animal donor that pose zoonotic risks for humans, but perhaps also enable them to import into human bodies the superior capacity of other species to deal with infection or disease. One example is the acquisition of crocodiles' high resistance to infection or naked mole rats' resistance to cancer and pain [8][9][10]. \n\nFinally, the use of purpose-made chimeras may also undermine the donor-based objections to xenotransplantation since chimeric donors would have never existed outside a xenotransplantation program, and thus owe their existence to it. If chimeras are well cared for until their moment of death, they will have lives worth living that they would not otherwise enjoy. Chimeras may, then, be seen not as the victims, but perhaps even beneficiaries of the program. This way, both donor-based objections and recipient-based objections, which appeal to the moral costs to the beneficiary of having harmed and then killed the donor, a creature that in some respects is a relative, are also canceled out, as the suitably humanized chimeras have valuable lives and depend for their existence on the practice of xenotransplantation.

This is demonstrated by the legal suits filed by Campaign for Responsible Transplantation (CRT). CRT was established by Alix Fano in New York. It is opposed to all forms xenotransplantation. CRT has taken legal action against the FDA and contested the appointment of committee members to the Secretary's Advisory Committee on Xenotransplantation (or SACX) (Bickford et al. 2005). SACX was set up by the Department of Health and Human Services to review xenotransplantation policies in the US. Fano maintained that the majority of committee members were scientists with a vested interest in xenotransplantation. Hence, she described the activities of SACX as a case of the 'fox guarding the hen house' (Allspaw 2004, 425).\n\nSimilarly, in the UK, the practice of xenotransplantation was contested by the animal rights group, Uncaged. In September 2000, Uncaged published a series of articles drawing upon leaked documents on the operations of Huntingdon Life Sciences in Cambridge (Einsiedel et al. 2011a). Huntingdon was contracted to perform xenotransplantation experiments on behalf of Imutran. The leaked documents exposed breaches of laboratory standards, undue suffering of animals and inaccurate reporting of scientific results. Imutran's attempt to secure an injunction to restrain the publications made by Uncaged was unsuccessful. Subsequently, Imutran terminated it research activities in the UK and relocated its work to an animal laboratory in the US (Einsiedel et al. 2011a).\n\nBy contrast to the US and UK, the Canadian approach emphasized collaboration and representation. Community consultation is a key process for achieving public consensus. In addition, the xenotransplantation issue was also shaped by a preceding controversy concerning the contamination of the Canadian blood supply. As a consequence, administrators took extra precautions to pursue a 'more pro-active' stance on risk management in transplantation than in the past (Einsiedel et al. 2011a, 624).\n\nTowards the end of 1997,",

Participants expressed concern about the ethics of using animals and the stigma of pigs in some religions. While many participants expressed ethical concerns, they didn't see them as a roadblock, particularly if the heart and islet cells from the pig kidney donor could be used for other recipients. Imams and rabbis argued that the need to honor human life would take precedence over religious prohibitions against eating pork. Some participants worried about stigma for the recipient, particularly children, as well as isolation if infection risk required them to stay [10] away from other people. Transplant administrators wondered whether insurers would pay for a pig kidney in someone who was too sick for a human kidney. Some participants questioned whether children should be given priority, while others worried about creating a two-tier system of who gets pig kidneys and whether pig and human kidneys are allocated differently. \n\nIn a theological symposium on xenotransplantation, the main themes among Jewish, Christian and Islamic commentators concerned the duty to heal, the need to treat the whole person and the need to put xenotransplantation in the context of its goals, the effect on the recipient, and the effects on society in terms of equity, justice and cost. A separate discussion of Islamic legal thinking about xenotransplantation examined the inherent contradictions in using an impure animal only if the treatment is considered life-saving [11]. Muhammad Mohiuddin, one of the cardiothoracic surgeons who transplanted a pig heart into a human recipient at the University of Maryland in January, told The New Yorker that as a Muslim he faced resistance from his family when he started to work with pigs. 'We don't eat pork or talk about pork.' But he said after talking to religious leaders, 'the consensus was that saving lives takes precedence over everything' [12].",

            "text": "In addition, cultural factors play a significant role in the acceptance of xenotransplantation in countries where post-mortem allotransplantation is not possible from a social point of view. For example, in Japan and India organ transplants from animals are a feasible alternative, but the opponents of these procedures cite various arguments against them, including philosophical, legal and medical factors. Of significance are also the above-mentioned arguments concerning the pursuit of anthropocentrism at all costs, and the utilitarian nature of such activity when animals become a \"reservoir of spare parts\" for people. Other issues involve potential problems with the recipient's identity and concerns relating to the \"tyranny of the gift\"6 . \n\nIn general, transplantation is usually perceived as a gift (Chyrowicz 2011), as an informed and fully voluntary decision. But can we really speak of informed decisions in the case of animals? Could the moral dilemma that is harvesting animal organs be solved by measures taken to increase the number of allotransplantations? These measures should target the largest possible groups of recipients to reliably present to them the dangers of organ donation, in addition to making them aware that transplantation is a lifesaving procedure which has no other substitute (Baum 2017). Using animal organs would not be necessary if there was a significant increase in donations from relatives and other unrelated living donors7 . \n\nLegal issues are also a cause of concern as the recipient loses at least some of their rights to anonymity and privacy, whilst being obliged to inform the people around them (including the medical community) of having a xenograft in their body (Smor\u0105g 2006). This may cause the organ recipient to feel discomfort and a sense of discrimination. Another legal aspect is the possible existence of \"xenotourism\", in other words, organised and commercial journeys to countries where xenotransplantation is possible8 . Nowadays, another example of controversial ethical research is creating animal embryos that contain human cells and transplant them into surrogate animals. The study was approved in 2019 in Japan (Cyranowski 2019).",

            "text": "For xenografting in general, non-human primates are the most closely related animals to humans phylogenetically (Estes et al., 2018). However, using these animals as donors introduces drawbacks related to ethical concerns, possible zoonotic illness transmission, high expense and long breeding times, and a variety of uncharacterized genetic alterations. Although the eye is immune-privileged (Zhou and Caspi, 2010;Taylor, 2016), innate, humoral, and cellular immune responses will impact corneal transplant rejection. Such immune responses are seen in corneal xenograft rejection produced by xenogeneic antigens, notably pig antigens (Sharifi et al., 2019;Oh et al., 2022). Immunologic reactivity, graft size, the existence of corneal endothelial cells, and critical differences between the donor and the recipient all affect the survival of a corneal xenograft. Promising trials were performed for lamellar or full-thickness corneal xenotransplantation with or without immunosuppressants to assess the time required for graft survival. It was found that this time varies based on the breed of the donor and recipient and the type of immunosuppressive treatment (Armitage et al., 2019). Aside from immunosuppression, three major approaches were tried to overcome xenogeneic rejection: genetic modification of the source animal, formation of bone marrow chimerism in the recipient, and encapsulation of the xenogeneic cells or tissues (Yoon et al., 2021a). \n\nOn the other hand, as we explore the potential of ocular xenografts that can be obtained from slaughterhouses, non-primates like cows, goats, pigs, and sheep offer additional benefits compared to nonhuman primates that relate to cost, accessibility, and supply (Sharifi et al., 2019). Furthermore, ethical concerns are reduced as these animals are traditionally reared for human consumption, considered the best donor model for xenotransplantation (Hryhorowicz et al., 2017), and at the forefront of evolving genetic modifications to reduce rejection (Ryczek et al., 2021;Allison, 2022).",

            "text": "The ethics of animal use for purposes of transplantation should be consistent across species and between captive and wild-caught animals. Moral responsibility assumes the target species is not endangered in the wild or is readily bred in captivity, and is treated with compassion and respect. Organ transplantation does not, and will never, represent an excuse for wholesale slaughter of any animal species. However, preservation and enhancement of the human species is the legitimate aim of xenotransplantation. That alone justifies utilization of baboons as surrogate participants in the research process. The individual life and welfare of a human should, ethically speaking, always trump concerns for the individual life of an animal, be it nonhuman primate or otherwise. \n\nThe concern for the broader issues of health and welfare of the human species is also a vital part of the quest for xenotransplantation. That quest goes beyond individual recipients and their families and caregivers. It has the potential to involve all of mankind if, indeed, novel infections of animal origin are introduced into the global population. Investigators need to determine if the cross-species transplantation risk to public health is real or if it is simply a perception of risk. Based on anecdotal history and laboratory and clinical studies, a \"real\" risk has yet to be demonstrated. Copious laboratory virology, however, suggests that caution is appropriate. \n\nThe perception of risk to the public health has occasionally stimulated intense, almost evangelical debate in public forums, in news media, and in the world of science fiction literature and motion pictures. The shading of objectivity on this issue has been distressingly counterproductive to the development of xenotransplantation. Clearly, if the discussion about the risk to public health is not laced with reason and solid, clinically applicable science, then the xenotransplant enterprise will not go forward, and will not succeed. Guidelines and safeguards for this type of research should be established, and investigators should thoroughly examine the potential for infectious disease transfer from animal donor to human recipient and beyond. Progress in xenotransplantation and future clinical trials cannot be aborted on the basis of a general fear of potential risk to public health. Intensive research is needed to minimize the public health concerns associated with what may be a critical lifesaving approach in the future.",

Even though there were several recombination variants in the herd, the transmission of PERV from XENO-1 tissue to human cells did not occur in vitro. Therefore, XENO-1 may represent a promising donor animal that meets the FDA industry guidelines for xenotransplantation (www.fda.gov, Guidance for Industry: Source Animal, Product, Preclinical, and Clinical Issues Concerning the Use of Xenotransplantation Products in Humans. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration). Our study assessed the important aspects of zoonosis using a novel herd of potential donor source animals validating this herd's ideal characteristics. A more thorough understanding of the latent influence of PERV on XENO-1 animals and human cells precipitates further study, including sequencing analyses of variant patterns and phenotypes, as well as functional studies of PERV-infected cells.",

            "text": "The opposite occurs with the implantation of an organ from another individual. In swine organ transplantation, the immunological barrier, even with the current genetic modifications, still represents a major limitation. However, the rapid biotechnological advances currently verified give a perspective of possible control not only of rejection but also of a possible pandemic from zoonosis through technology to remove porcine genes harmful to the human species. \n\nBioethics in its interfaces with humanity fulfills its transdisciplinary role, which goes beyond and across disciplines. It broadens the discussions on morality in the therapy of xenotransplants, including the issue of animal rights, in a desirable platform for discussion about creating/ sacrificing/using for food and creating/sacrificing/using for scientific research. It is interesting how Bioethics encourages us to read some subjects and want to ask some questions, such as thinking about the cultural situation between transplant medicine and nutrition/gastronomy. In this way, bioethics motivates thinking and approaching difficulties in different and multidisciplinary ways, taking advantage of the intelligence of many to develop knowledge. \n\nFinally, it is important to discuss the ethical problem of the criteria for the indication and allocation of genetically modified pigs. These first cases were performed in patients outside the regular criteria for allotransplantation (transplantation between human beings), which could compromise the success of these transplants. Another relevant aspect is the cost of the production of a genetically modified swine. The current cost will certainly restrict the indication of this procedure to people with greater economic power. \n\nThe authors conclude by stating that bioethics in xenotransplantation using genetically modified pigs presents more doubts than certainties. Society as a whole, including bioethicists, politics, and the scientific community, needs to come to some understanding of the risk/benefit calculation and make decisions and protocols about clinical xenotransplantation. This understanding must be based on scientific research with an appropriate methodology that always promotes the elucidation of the truth.",

As long as there is a persistent disparity between the number of people on the waitlist and number of available organs, equity issues will be of foremost concern in relation to who, when, and how one receives an organ 1 . Xenotransplantation is not a new technology, but the clinical application is still experimental 16 . Xenotransplantation has the promise of providing more organs at a quicker pace, theoretically significantly increasing access to solid-organ transplantation in racial and ethnic minority groups who historically have had longer waiting times and higher waitlist dropout rates. \n\nDespite the aforementioned advances in genetic pig engineering, several serious ethical considerations have been identified and were the focus of a 2023 American Transplant Congress session entitled, \"Ethical Concerns in Pig to Human Xenotransplantation [17][18][19] \". These ethical considerations include animal rights concerns, public health and infectious disease risks, and questions regarding justice and equity in organ access and use of resources [17][18][19] . Not specifically addressed during this session were the implications of xenotransplantation in relation to transplant inequities experienced by racial and ethnic minorities. It is not unreasonable to postulate that xenotransplantation could represent one strategy in addressing inequities in organ allocation. However, specifically targeting predominately racial and ethnic minorities for xenotransplantation at the potential risk of inequitable access to human donor transplant (the standard of care) would serve to create a new disparity in transplant care. \n\nHow then do we support xenotransplantation as a prospective innovative treatment option without creating more, new, or different inequities? As an initial step, protocols in xenotransplantation clinical trials should be evaluated to ensure adequate representation of all populations. Racial and ethnic minorities are typically underrepresented in clinical trials 20 . As a result, there are often knowledge gaps regarding safety and efficacy of new treatments in these populations. Inequitable representation in xenotransplantation clinical trials could serve as an initial disparity that becomes magnified when determining allocation policies for equitable pig or human organ access.",

One cautionary argument in opposition to the use of animal organs concerns the possibility of transferring animal bacteria and viruses to humans. Some argue that xenotransplantation is the only www.intechopen.com potential way of addressing this shortage. As immunological barriers to xenotransplantation are better understood, those hurdles are being addressed through genetic engineering of donor animals and the development of new drugs therapies [Starzl etal 1964& Grant etal 2001. The focus of ethical attention has changed from the moral correctness of using animals for research/therapy to an increasingly appreciated danger of the establishment and spread of xenozoonses in recipients, their contacts and the general public. There are a number of reasons for not using subhuman primates for xenotransplantation, including their closeness to humans, the likelihood of passing on infections, their availability (gorillas, chimpanzees), their slow breeding and the expense of breeding them under specified pathogen free conditions. The pig, although domesticated and familiar, is too distant to evoke the same feeling as we have for primates, has the correct size organs, is probably less likely to pass infections, breeds rapidly and is not endangered; moreover, millions of them are eaten every year. Although drawing ethical conclusions is difficult at the stage of knowledge and debate, it seems acceptable to manipulate pigs genetically and to proceed to using their organs for xenotransplantation trials when infection control measures and the scientific base justify it [Bukler etal 1999& Sim etal 1999. The use of pigs in Muslim countries would be more controversial and disruptive although it is acceptable by Islamic religion in case of a real need and when there is no alternative [Rahman 1998]. In this case the question of informed consent is likely to be ambiguous and awkward. It might end up more of a binding legal contract than consent, as we understand it now. Xenotransplantation is also unlikely to cost less than or significantly alleviate the shortage of cadaveric organs in the short term. The international dimension of the risk of infection is becoming obvious, but there has so far been no effort to",

Griffith and scientific/program director Muhammad Mohiuddin [3], successfully transplanted a gene-edited pig heart into a patient with end-stage cardiac failure at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.The donor pigs had 10 genetic modifications.Four genes were knocked out or inactivated, including one encoding a molecule (Nglycolylneuraminic acid) that causes an aggressive human rejection response and a growth gene (growth hormone receptor) that was knocked out to prevent the pig's heart from growing after transplantation.",

As a result of these efforts, costeffective generation of donor pigs will be possible, and it is expected that porcine islets will be delivered to many patients who truly need this treatment modality. Some countries have responded to this consensus statement. In Japan, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare also revised the \"guidelines on public health infection problems associated with the implementation of xenotransplantation\" in 2016. Xenotransplantation can be used to treat serious diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and kidney disease. Also, patients who cannot currently receive transplants may be able to receive transplants 2 Medical animals can provide high-quality cells, tissues, and organs. Genetically modified animals may further improve outcomes. Medical animals are limited to closed colonies. Breeding should be done at a well-controlled pathogen-free facility, with high standards for animal welfare. Medical animals are verified by testing for the absence of known pathogens and, moreover, must be kept free of infectious diseases by continuous observation 3 Xenotransplantation is a complex procedure with risk of rejection, poor graft function, and known or unknown infections. There is a risk of developing serious or new infections, and patients, relatives, or other humans and animals may be infected 4 Because of the risk to the community at large, clinical trials of xenotransplantation should be conducted under strict regulation. Xenotransplantation should not be performed in the absence of national regulations. These regulations should have legal basis and be able to prohibit nonregulatory transplants. Furthermore, this regulatory framework should ensure transparency to the general public and should include both science and ethics 5 \n\nGiven the risk to the community, the benefit to the patient should be high. In particular, preclinical studies should be conducted using animal experiments with predictable effects to demonstrate the safety and efficacy recommended by the international scientific community. Proposed clinical trials should be assessed by the relevant regulatory authorities to minimize risk 6 Personnel responsible for clinical trials should explain the inclusion criteria in order to justify the clinical trial.",

The use of organs from these animals would theoretically reduce the important mortality on transplant lists worldwide due to the lack of donors. ][3][4][5] Swine is a species with great potential to be an organ donor because they have organs morphologically and physiologically compatible with those of humans; nevertheless, this method may cause hyperacute rejection, an immunological reaction caused by pre-formed antibodies that destroy the transplanted organs in a few hours and are always present in transplantation between species very different (discordant xenotransplantation). [1][2][3] This catastrophic immunological reaction was responsible for the failures of the first xenotransplants performed using organs and tissues from non-genetically modified animals in the 60s and 70s and caused the abandonment of this methodology. 2,4 ][7] The evolution of genetic modulation of living beings using technologies such as CRISPR/Cas9 (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) provide the creation of genetically modified pigs whose organs would be immunologically compatible with human, escaping from hyperacute rejection. 8 Research using an organ from these modified animals transplanted in non-human primates accomplished promising results, especially in terms of survival and function. 9 hese progresses revived the interest in clinical xenotransplantation and brought great hope to thousands of patients on the transplant list and inspired optimistic expectations in several researchers. Shekhar AC, from the Center for Bioethics at Harvard University (USA), believes that the use of organs from these animals would solve the bioethical challenges associated with post-brain-death donation and the risks of living donation. 10 Prof. Silvano Raia, Professor Emeritus at HC-FMUSP and a world pioneer in liver transplantation recently leads a research group that aim to build in Brasil a vivarium specializing in the production of genetically modified pigs to serve as organ transplant donors. 11",

It is due to the fact that transplants of animal organs are currently in the experimental phase. The main current problem of transplantology is the shortage of organs; hence, the search for new solutions has become an everyday challenge. If a way for the human body to tolerate animal organs could be found, transplant medicine and humanity would be in a completely different place. The authors introduce the concepts of transplantation and xenotransplantation and their origins, then they raise ethical issues related to this type of organ transplantation. Finally, the authors conclude that xenotransplantations have a chance to be \u201cincorporated\u201d (back again) in the \u201ctransplants\u201d category when the experimental phase of xenotransplantation shifts to the implementation stage. Time will tell whether it will be possible.",

            "text": "The success of allotransplantation as a treatment for end-stage organ failure has resulted in the need for an increasing number of organ donors. Attempts to meet this need include the use of organs from living related and unrelated donors, financial or other incentives for the donor family, and even the reuse of transplanted organs. Despite these initiatives, the supply of organs for transplantation still falls far short of the demand, as evidenced by longer waiting times for transplantation and decreasing transplantation rates. Even if Canada were able to increase its organ donor rate to that of Spain (40 to 50/million), where organ donation is governed by 'presumed consent' legislation, this would not alleviate the problem of donor shortage. Interest in xenotransplantation stems from the need to overcome this increasingly severe shortage of human organs. Indeed, some argue that xenotransplantation is the only potential way of addressing this shortage. As immunological barriers to xenotransplantation are better understood, those hurdles are being addressed through genetic engineering of donor animals and the development of new drug therapies.

Of these, xenotransplantation, or the transplantation of organs across species, has been considered, with early applications dating back to the 1600s. The purpose of this review is to summarize the early experiences of xenotransplantation, with special focus on heart xenotransplantation. It aims to highlight the important ethical concerns of animal-to-human heart xenotransplantation, identify the key immunological barriers to successful long-term xenograft survival, as well as summarize the progress made in terms of development of pharmacological and genetic engineering strategies to address these barriers. Lastly, we discuss more recent attempts of porcine-to-human heart xenotransplantation, as well as provide some commentary on the current concerns and possible applications for future clinical heart xenotransplantation.",

            "text": "Previous research has established that women, on average, may exhibit higher levels of empathy and compassion toward animals compared to men. Likewise, women are often prominent in animal advocacy and activism; they may be more likely to engage in activities such as volunteering at animal shelters, supporting animal rights organizations, and advocating for humane treatment. Women, on average, may be more likely to own pets and to express strong emotional bonds with their animals; the companionship and caregiving aspects of pet ownership can contribute to a heightened awareness of animal welfare issues [101]. Women are often overrepresented in occupations related to animal care, such as veterinary medicine, animal welfare organizations, and pet grooming [102]; this professional involvement may contribute to a heightened awareness of and concern for animal welfare. \n\nAs per the mediation analysis of this study, attitudes towards animals (as measured by the BMAAS) serve as partial mediator of women's greater moral disapproval of xenotransplantation. Therefore, once again, assuming that xenotransplantation is a worthy moral endeavor (to the extent that, as mentioned in the Introduction, xenotransplantation is a viable partial solution to the problem of shortage of organs in donation), and assuming that it is desirable to increase the moral acceptance of xenotransplantation amongst Egyptians, policymakers and researchers ought to focus on women. But in so doing, it must be understood that an important way of increasing women's approval of xenotransplantation comes through some assurance that animals used in xenotransplantation would be offered some acceptable measure of welfare. \n\nInterestingly, in this study, pet owners do show attitudes of greater care towards animals, as measured by BMAAS (t(893) = \u2212 3.59, p < 0.01, d = \u2212 3.67). This reproduces some results in previous research [103,104]. But in this study, owning a pet is not, by and of itself, a relevant factor in predicting the moral approval of xenotransplantation. The relevant aspect is attitudes towards animals (as measured by the BMAAS) on a more abstract level. \n\nFinally, it is important to consider whether having a child may predict approval of xenotransplantation.",

Specifically, the transplantation of kidneys from genetically engineered pigs into human patients has made significant progress, offering a potential clinical solution to the shortage of human kidney supply. Recent trials involving the transplantation of these modified porcine kidneys into deceased human bodies have underscored the practicality of this approach, advancing the field towards potential clinical applications. However, numerous challenges remain, especially in the domains of identifying suitable donor-recipient matches and formulating effective immunosuppressive protocols crucial for transplant success. Critical to advancing xenotransplantation into clinical settings are the nuanced considerations of anesthesia and surgical practices required for these complex procedures. The precise genetic modification of porcine kidneys marks a significant leap in addressing the biological and immunological hurdles that have traditionally challenged xenotransplantation. Yet, the success of these transplants hinges on the process of meticulously matching these organs with human recipients, which demands thorough understanding of immunological compatibility, the risk of organ rejection, and the prevention of zoonotic disease transmission. In parallel, the development and optimization of immunosuppressive protocols are imperative to mitigate rejection risks while minimizing side effects, necessitating innovative approaches in both pharmacology and clinical practices.

Specifically, these include two heart and two kidney surgeries in the USA and a liver transplant in China. The heart transplantation patients survived 6 and 8 weeks, the kidney patients 2 months. For the liver transplantation patient from China, there is no news available. 1 Xenotransplantation has also seen initial exemplifications as a subject of policymaking. It marked the first instance in which the precautionary principle was advised in the realm of bioethics (Sobbrio and Jorqui 2014). Additionally, xenotransplantation has prompted public consultation projects in several countries as well as an European Union-wide research project on participatory technology assessment (Griessler et al 2012). In social research, xenotransplantation serves as an instructive example to illustrate forms of governance and control such as 'pre-emptive' biopolitics and various social relations (including those associated with patienthood, animal ethics, biocapital and expertise). \n\nXenotransplantation is not a new science and there are documented experiments dating back to at least the 1600s (Deschamps et al 2005) with an intensification of sporadic attempts in the USA especially during the mid-to-late 20th century involving non-human primates as source animals and human patients. Most recently, novel scientific insights have emerged with the development of the gene editing system CRISPR-Cas (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats), a tool that scientists working in the field of xenotransplantation praise for its technoscientific capacities to overcome previous hurdles like porcine endogenous retroviruses alongside a host of other transspecies immunological challenges. In addition to the recent pig-to-human transplantations, experiments with genetically engineered pig organs have been conducted on brain-dead individuals in the USA and in China, attempting to supplement the preclinical non-human primate model (Montgomery et al 2024). Yet despite these developments and changes in the scientific and clinical landscape of xenotransplantation, many social and ethical aspects persist.",

Transplant teams utilizing xenografts as a source of donor organs should be prepared to discuss these issues as the regular use of xenografts moves forward in \"daily\" clinical practice. There are many social benefits that xenotransplantation can help realize, namely relief of the long wait times for a suitable allograft, reduction in dialysis complications, and, especially in some parts of the world, elimination of coercion and financial compensation for organs (71). However, a number of ethical and psychosocial issues exist around xenotransplantation that do not necessarily apply to the use of traditional human allografts.\n\nIn some cultures, the use of porcine-based products is considered taboo, though some scholars from these groups will allow for transplants from pigs if the patient would die from organ failure without it (12). There are additionally those who eschew the use of animals and/or animal products as a source of food or dry goods for either religious or animal welfare concerns, and these individuals may take issue with utilization of xenografts as a resource for reducing the transplant wait list (88). There are others still that take issue with raising animals with the exclusive intent of utilizing their organs for xenotransplantation, though the anticipated number of animals needed for this purpose is significantly smaller than the more than 100 million animals killed for food each year in the US alone (82,88). Keeping in mind the perspective of balancing risks and benefits between use and needs, it is worth mentioning that 240 patients on dialysis die every day in the United States (89).\n\nPigs raised as a source of xenografts would likely require confinement to reduce the risk of infection and subsequent transmission of an infection to the future recipient of the xenograft. Animals raised under such conditions would not be in an environment in which they would be able to freely roam and interact with other animals like some of their farm-raised counterparts (12,88). This leads to a conflict among those with animal welfare concerns because the need to raise a xenograftdonor pig in a sterile environment to protect the recipient is in direct conflict with the pig's",

If some other people come to decide that xenotransplantation as a concept may be morally acceptable, then promoters of xenotransplantation must dedicate substantial efforts to meet the ethical guidelines for the proper treatment of animals in xenotransplantation, as this may prove to be an effective strategy in persuading people in Egypt to offer greater moral approval of xenotransplantation. Of course, it is sensible to posit that good animal treatment should be implemented for its own sake, but promoters of xenotransplantation should understand that the quality of animal treatment is fundamental in preserving the base of people who morally approve of xenotransplantation, as bad animal treatment would likely turn away people from approving xenotransplantation procedures, and women are more sensitive on this issue.",

            "text": ": Xenotransplantation, involving animal organ transplantation into humans to address the human organ shortage, has been studied since the 17th century. Early attempts to obtain organs from animals such as goats, dogs, and non-human primates proved unsuccessful. In the 1990s, scientists agreed that pigs were the most suitable donor animals for xenotransplantation. However, immune rejection between pig and human has hindered the application. To overcome these challenges, researchers developed genetically modified pigs that deactivate xenoreactive antigen genes and express human protective genes. These advances extended xenograft survival from days to years in non-human primates, resulting in the first human heart xeno-transplant trial. Using genetically engineered pigs for the organ shortage is promising. This review provides an overview of potential incompatibilities of immunogenicity and functional proteins related to xenotransplantation between humans and pigs. Furthermore, it elucidates possible approaches for multiplex gene modification to breed better-humanized pigs for clinical xenotransplantation.",

These perturbations, as I note above, stem from insights into genomics but also the creation of transpecies hybrid embryos for research and other areas of biotechnology including genetic engineering in addition to immunological insights into species symbiosis and beneficial parasitism, and so on. Xenotransplantation also extends and focuses long-standing controversies about the use of animals as model proxies for humans in medical research, let alone as novel sources of immunologically 'humanised' cells, organs, tissues and biodevices. In historical terms, dating back centuries even, humans have been the recipients of blood and tissues from an eclectic menagerie of animals including other primates and 'higher' simians (apes, baboons, macaques, rhesus monkeys, chimpanzees, etc.) and 'domesticated' animals (guinea pigs, dogs, rabbits, goats, sheep, cows and pigs, etc.). \n\nThe question of species desirability in xenotransplantation has operated in relation to a rich and complex number of socio-cultural, scientific and physiological factors. These include, but are not limited to, the conventional use of some animals as 'meat' in the human food chain; or conversely the breeding of some species as 'companion animals' and pets; whether a species is understood to be a 'wild type' and subject to certain kinds of international protections; the amenability of some animals to rapid reproduction and therefore accelerated cycles of bespoke breeding programmes; the extent to which certain species are known to harbour, or not, various pathogens, parasites and viruses; the relative physiological size of a source species; the different responses of species to genetic engineering for immunological adaptation; the impact of sterile biosecurity measures upon the welfare of different species, and so on. The immunitary biopolitics of xenotransplantation are therefore rife with dilemmas N.

The choice of the optimal donor species for xenotransplantation has not been completely resolved. The recent cloning of farm animals suggests that animals developed using genetic engineering or traditional breeding methods may radically alter concepts of animal selection. Issues of availability, cost, infectious risk, and ethical concerns require careful consideration. The selection of the appropriate source species for xenotransplantation is central to the design of microbiological testing regimens and to the nature of the immune suppression selected to maintain graft function. \n\nObservations on infectious diseases in immunocompromised swine used in studies of xenotransplantation also offer some insights into the care that may be needed to breed swine as donor animals. \n\nAntibiotic use has adverse effects on the microbial ecology of an inbred population of swine and the spread of antimicrobial resistance within a closed breeding colony is rapid. New microbial pathogens will require the development of new diagnostic techniques for clinical use. These tests must include culture and molecular techniques, as serologic testing for animal-derived organisms in humans is generally unavailable or unreliable. Serologic tests are often falsely negative in the immunocompromised host. While survival of nonhuman primates receiving swine kidneys has reached multiple months, this represents a relatively limited period of observation for the emergence of latent infection. \n\nNonhuman primates and swine have received the greatest attention as potential source animals. Concerns raised regarding the infectious risks associated with the use of nonhuman primates as organ donors for humans have led the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to preclude the use of these species as organ donors for humans. The FDA document states that xenotransplants from nonhuman primates would expose \"recipients, their close contacts, and the public a t large . . . to significant infectious disease risk\" (Guidance for Industry, U.S. F.D.A., March, 1999).",

[38] This is not merely an ethical dilemma that trades life for life but rather requires multiple animals to be used and killed for every human life potentially extended. As Jan Dutkiewicz writes, \"embracing xenotransplantation involves embracing the commodification, modification, and slaughter of animals on an unknown scale.\" [39] he 3Rs-replacement, reduction, and refinement-are pioneering principles of animal use in medical research and testing. [40] In line with these general principles, U.S. federal agencies require researchers to consider alternatives to animal use; [41] but this framework is notoriously subjective, allowing researchers and oversight committees to justify any number of animals and any methods of research on the grounds of necessity for obtaining the knowledge sought. A more comprehensive framework of principles for animal research ethics was recently proposed based on social benefit and animal welfare. [42] Included in this framework is the Principle of No Alternative Method, a more robust version of the 3Rs notion of replacement: \"use of animal subjects must be the sole ethically acceptable way to address a research problem whose solution offers the prospect of a social benefit\", ( [42] p.6). According to this principle, because there are feasible alternatives for addressing transplant needs that do not cause harm to animals, those alternatives should be prioritized. Thus, because pigs are sentient animals with moral status, and because there is a wealth of strategies beyond xenotransplantation for solving the organ shortage that have yet to receive investment to match their potential, those alternatives should be pursued.",

The pioneering pig-to-human heart transplant in 2022 (Griffith et al., 2022), alongside encouraging data from experiments using pig kidneys (Montgomery et al., 2022), underscores the potential of xenotransplantation to address organ shortages. Crucial to these advancements are genetic modifications enabled by gene-editing techniques, mainly CRISPR-Cas9, which allow for the modification of animal organs more akin to human physiology, reducing rejection risks (Ryczek et al., 2021). Utilizing edited animals offers a dependable supply of quality-controlled organs, optimizing size, structure, and function while mitigating infectious risks. Xenotransplantation could broaden access to transplantation, particularly for those at early stages of organ failure, improving outcomes and quality of life (Sykes and Sachs, 2022). The pig, due to its size, availability, breeding characteristics, and physiological likeness to humans, has emerged as the preferred source animal for xenografts (Xi et al., 2023).",

The modification of the recipient's body (that is, what they are) also alters their subjectivity, and therefore of who they are; this is a persistent phenomenon that has accompanied human organ donation. It is not my intention to challenge whether the narratives are true nor to take sides in the debate. Rather I suggest that these narratives are important and use them as a starting point to ask: 'If narratives about interspecies solid organ transplantation are said to alter recipient subjectivity, would this also be the case when intra-species procedures such as xenotransplantation, should become successful?'. This is an important question, not least because the supply of human organs for transplantation has never met the global demand for them; this shortage is arguably one of the drivers to those who continue to conduct experimental research with xenotransplantation.\n\nNon-human animals and humans share similar biological and physiological features and it is this similarity that xenotransplantation experimentation for human organ transplantation is premised on. This sits within a wider discourse of non-human and human similarity in which much of human DNA is shared with a variety of distantly related creatures. Indeed, Robert and Baylis (2003) argue that given the evidence that all living things share a common ancestor, there is little (if anything) uniquely human. The emphasis on the similarities between non-human animals and humans has led to the increasing value of non-human animal materiality for human therapy.\n\nThis discourse of the value of the shared physiological features between human and non-human is challenged however by an awareness of the rights of non-human animals based on a recognition that Original research they share emotional and cognate abilities similar to human beings. This is partly why the term 'nonhuman animals' is used by animal activists and academics in the field of animal studies 1 (Francione 2008).\n\nNon-human animals are thought to share some of the social characteristics of human beings, and human beings are said to share some physical characteristics of non-human animals. Yet, these different notions of similarity and difference create a paradox within xenotransplantation. That is, xenotra",

            "text": "After xenotransplantation, the risk of exposure to endogenous viruses will emerge. Such exposure may affect transplant recipients and the general population since some diseases can spread throughout a community. These events pose a public health risk, as shown in Figure 4. Concerns for the transplant recipient's safety and public health severely limit the privacy of such recipients, as they must be checked for viruses that are deadly to them and others for extended periods. Therefore, safety and ethical conflicts can arise while balancing patient and societal benefits (Melo et al., 2001). \n\nSlaughterhouses are potential reservoirs of bacterial, parasitic, prion, and viral pathogens (Franke-Whittle and Insam, 2013). These pathogens can infect both animals and humans. As a result, the proper handling of animal carcasses has always been and continues to be a concern for the food and waste management industries. Thus, the use of this form of waste has several limitations compared to the conventional acquisition of tissues/organs from laboratory animals. Specifically, slaughterhouse environments are incompatible with the pathogen-free environments required for biomedical applications. As a result, this issue needs to be addressed in a manner that would not adversely influence the price of meat and food sustainability. \n\nRecently, the identification of slaughterhouse waste as potential energy sources that can reduce the reliance on petroleum-based fuels has prompted the need to re-examine biosecurity measures for support initiatives beyond disposal. In this case, biosecurity refers to measures aimed at minimizing the risk to prevent the introduction or spread of harmful organisms to various individuals that come into contact with these tissues (Vinneras et al., 2012), particularly researchers, clinicians, and recipients, and in turn, the wider community. \n\nAlthough modern pathogen-free facilities and thorough testing have alleviated particular concerns for transplantation, issues related to exogenous retroviruses incorporated into the xenograft's genome remain (Wijkstrom et al., 2017). Evidence has been presented on how such retrovirions can be eradicated using gene-editing techniques and that these microbes can be managed with currently available antiretrovirals. Thus, the risk of infections arising from xenotransplantation may be comparable to allotransplantation.",

Extracting and transplanting organs from pigs is a promising solution to the current, increasing, global crisis of human organ scarcity, and would provide a vast supply of organs, which could be obtained quickly and selectively. Although potential harms of pig-to-human xenotransplantation exist, such as cross-species infection, transplant rejection, psychological harm, risks of wear and tear and threats to altruism, these harms may be mitigated through appropriate strategies. We address the objection that xenotransplantation is unnatural. We respond that the sense in which xenotransplantation is unnatural is unclear, and moreover, does not demonstrate that it is wrong. Overall, we claim that the benefits of pig-to-human xenotransplantation are likely to outweigh the harms, if appropriate steps are taken. Genetically modified pigs offer hope for a vast supply of organs for transplant in patients, along with a potentially avoidable risk of transplant rejection and disease transmission.",

            "text": "shortages in human transplantation, while serious ethical concerns persist. Xenotransplantation is \"the transplantation, implantation, or infusion into a human recipient of . . . live cells, tissues, or organs from a non-human animal source or human body fluids, cells, tissues or organs that have had ex vivo contact with live nonhuman animal cells, tissues, or organs\" [1].\n\nBioethicists and animal ethicists are devoted to upholding the ethical treatment and protection of their respective human and non-human animal populations. With differing paradigms-animal ethics framed via orientations ranging from agency-based, to contextual, relational, ecological, or rights theory-based, and bioethics via orientations as diverse as principlist, feminist, virtue-based, egalitarian, deontological, utilitarian, communitarian, and more-and no consensus as to which framework(s) should predominate, interspecies ethics discussions are all the more daunting. In this paper, I suggest that literary reflections can add a valuable dimension to bioethics and animal ethics deliberations, providing a meta-narrative against which to assess normative practices. After decades of resistance by the science community, the soft sciences (e.g., psychology, sociology) are finally granted seating at the same deliberative table. And it is within this spirit of collaborative discourse that I suggest application of a literary lens to moral deliberations. Beginning with synopses and excerpts from three books highlighting a shifting moral status view of human-pig relationships, I review personhood attributions through biological, philosophical, and legal frameworks; discuss benefits/risks of xenotransplantation; reflect on moral status of non-human animals; and offer concluding thoughts.",

The resulting Changsha Communiqu\u00e9 broadly inscribed 10 guiding principles and 20 recommendations for consideration by \"the WHO, Member States, Investigators, and proposers of clinical trials using xenotransplantation products\". This pivotal document provided evidence-based guidance as well as expert opinion regarding clinical trial design and was a landmark document in establishing guidance for xenotransplantation. It also strengthened the collaborative link between the IXA and TTS and the WHO. This guidance was approved by the WHA and published in 2009 [49,63]. The guiding principles addressed the ethical and safety considerations surrounding xenotransplantation, emphasized the need for rigorous scientific research, robust ethical standards, and the protection of public health and animal welfare, and advocated for transparent risk assessment, informed consent, and international collaboration to minimize potential risks and address ethical concerns. The recommendations provide detailed specific guidance on ensuring the safety and efficacy of xenotransplantation practices, including the establishment of regulatory frameworks, the implementation of stringent biosafety measures, and the promotion of public and scientific dialogue to ensure responsible and ethical advancements in this field. \n\nIn 2011, the WHO and IXA organized the Second WHO Global Consultation on Regulatory Requirements for Xenotransplantation Clinical Trials, held at the WHO headquarters in Geneva [50]. This meeting focused on the refinement of guidance for infectious disease surveillance, prevention, and how best to respond appropriately to various clinical xenotransplant trial scenarios [50] significantly updating the 2001 document (WHO Guidance document on Xenogeneic Infection/Disease Surveillance and Response: A strategy for International Cooperation and Coordination) [24,33,50]. \n\nAs a direct outcome of the 2011 meeting, IXA infectious disease experts and other participants from the Consultation published a position paper in 2012 on xenotransplantation-associated infectious risks and proposed several preventative and mitigation strategies [24].",

As a result, from their point of View, torturing and killing animals to transplant their organs to human beings is unethical and means lowering animals' status to things or to a tool box. 28 Along with this point of view, another group of animal ethics philosophers, especially utilitarian philosophers like Peter Singer, have not refused the idea of using animals for saving human life, and in contrast, only through attribution requirements, they have tried to limit and to decrease the quantity and quality of such a use. 29 ased on the broad definition, the goal, in addition to keeping the animal away from negative factors, is to give a chance to animal to show its species-specific behavior and live according to its type. In other words, in this definition of animal welfare, the concept of being natural is highly emphasized. 30 erefore, genetic modification of animals is basically the total destruction of their welfare because the integrity of animal genome is manipulated to create an animal which is different from its natural type. Furthermore, in order to prevent transfer of any kind of virus, these animals should be kept in a completely quarantined place and be imprisoned. This has caused a lot of ethical criticism, because keeping animals imprisoned in a place that is not similar to its natural habitat, far from any interaction with its kind, takes its chance to live naturally. The broad definition of animal welfare is close to the animal right school, so, it seems that welfare of the animals cannot be provided with this definition in most of the farms and labs.",

[99]. Xenotransplantation offers new hope for people on organ transplantation waiting lists. \n\nThe earliest record of xenotransplantation was a cornea transplantation trial that took place in 1838 [100]. Another xenotransplantation of a rabbit kidney to a human was done in 1905, and the patient died after 17 days due to graft rejection [101]. Between 1920-1990 many transplant studies were done using the kidneys, hearts, and livers of non-human primates [102], as well as other mammals, including rabbits, sheep, and pigs [103]. \n\nThe modern concept of xenotransplantation focuses mainly on pigs as donors, pigs share physiological similarities with humans, reach sexual maturity within few months, and produce large litters. Moreover, they carry a lower risk of zoonotic disease transmission compared to nonhuman primates (NHPs) and can be bred under specific pathogen-free (SPF) conditions, which further minimizes infection risks [104]. Additionally, the use of primate organs is unsustainable due to ethical concerns and the endangered status of many primate species [105]. \n\nThe Third WHO Global Consultation on Regulatory Requirements for Xenotransplantation Clinical Trials recommended that donor pigs should possess a minimum set of 'essential' genetic modifications [106]; those recommendations are based on three main principles:",

            "text": "Xenotransplantation from a veterinary and a faith perspective is full of \"what ifs\" and \"what next\" contemplations. In the Anglican Communion, of which the Episcopal Church is part, there has been no consensus as to whether to allow or disallow the use of xenotransplantation to save a human life [42][43][44]. \n\nThe veterinary profession has been integral in the development of transplantation and xenotransplantation technology, not only through its focus on the care of research animals but also an active role in the research of the technologies used in both allo-and xenotransplantation. For many decades, many hearts of Episcopalians and veterinarians have beat with pig or cow valves in place. Editorials on xenotransplantation from Anglican theologians generally do not mention this established technology. The more serious review seems to have happened when research started to focus on solid organ transplant, using genetic manipulation to reduce transplant rejection. So, while there has been no formal declaration concerning the use of animal organs for human use, there are a few scenarios that are likely to play a role for the individual for whom it is offered (and their families). \n\nAnglicans are very committed to creating care, which includes animal welfare, including animals used for meat production or medical research. Given that the donor animal has been genetically modified and needs to be as close to gnotobiotic as feasible for the life of the animal, the care and welfare of the animal needs to be high. Since it is the pig, that is, the animal being used for this research, the physical care and mental health care of the animal are not inconsequential in terms of space, time, and other resources. The second part is when the animal's life is ended, the disposal of the remains, which potentially contain the human genome, becomes not only a biohazard assessment but also creates a question of how one mentally and spiritually addresses the disposal of the human genetic material. Historically, many Christian people would have a prayer service for an amputated limb which was then buried. This is not an understanding that the material, whether incorporated into a pig's genome or a human limb, is a human being.",

On January 7th, 2022, a successful genetically edited porcine to human HT was performed with 60 days patient survival (31). On autopsy, the xenograft showed findings that were not consistent with typical rejection: it was edematous, nearly doubled in weight, and histologic examination revealed scattered myocyte necrosis, interstitial edema, and red-cell extravasation, without evidence of microvascular thrombosis. Studies are currently under way to identify the mechanisms responsible for these changes (32) and clearly, this experience has highlighted the presence of pathophysiological patterns that have yet to be understood. The topic of xenotransplantation, which could allow new, exciting therapeutic perspectives, raises political, ethical and moral concerns, that will have to be addressed in the years to come. Nevertheless, it represents an interesting new frontier which could make a significant contribution in solving the problem of donor shortage, guaranteeing survival hopes for patients with terminal heart disease currently lacking therapeutic alternatives.",

            "text": "However, animal organs bring great challenges to the present immunosuppression regimen, and it is still unknown whether the existing immunosuppressants can effectively control the response of the host rejections to xenografts. In the first attempt at pig heart-to-human transplantation, conventional antirejection drugs and a new immunosuppressing drug made by Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals (Lexington, MA, USA) were used. However, its long-term effects remain to be observed. Due to the different lifespans between humans and other animals, it will be interesting to know the longevity of transplanted organs. In addition, animal-derived diseases are another important issue in the setting of xenotransplantation. One reason for scientists to choose pigs as donor animals is that they are less likely than nonhuman primates to transmit pathogens because they are more distantly related to humans. \n\nIn addition to transplantation techniques, immune rejection, and transmission of heterogeneous pathogens, medical ethics is a problem that needs to be solved in the pig-to-human heart transplant operation (Figure 1). The genetically modified heart\uff0cwhich emergency authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) , was transplanted into the end-stage heart disease patient who was ineligible for a conventional heart transplantation. The xenotransplantation would be the last chance for life. The type of animal species used is very important. Based on the transmission of pathogens and the objections raised by most societies and animal rights organizations, the transplantation of organs from primates will not be allowed. However, pigs are generally considered to be an ideal potential source of organs for human xenotransplantation. Pig organs are similar to human organs in size and shape. They are easy to obtain, and both inbred lines and outbred lines are used in preclinical research. In addition, pigs can be cloned by somatic cell nuclear transfer, and their genomes can be edited by engineered nucleases such as zinc finger nuclease, transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN), and CRISPR-Cas9 systems.",

            "text": "Based on the ever increasing shortage of suitable human donor organs, alternative solutions are sought to diminish the difference between the number of required and executable organ transplantations. Xenotransplantation, i.e., the transplantation of organs (tissues or cells) between different species seems to be a possible solution, since it could provide unlimited resources of transplantable organs. Although the nonhuman primates would appear to be the ideal donor animals for human xenotransplantation because of both immunological and physiological similarities, there are several problems associated with their possible application: the majority of them belong to the group of endangered species, they are difficult to breed, their aseptic housing is not solved, the techniques for their genetic manipulation have not yet been developed, and there are considerable infectious-microbiological and ethical concerns that do not favor their application. Therefore, the attention of the scientific world has turned toward the pig as a potential organ donor. The pig has several advantages: it is available in large numbers, easy to breed, it can be housed under aseptic conditions, the techniques for its genetic manipulation are known, and considering that it is consumed worldwide, the ethical concerns would be minor compared to that of nonhuman primates. Nevertheless, since the evolutionary distance between the swine and the human species is much greater than the corresponding distance between humans and the nonhuman primates, the immunological barriers appear to be more difficult to overcome in the pig to human xenotransplantation model than in the primate to human model [1][2][3][4]. \n\nBased on the experimental findings using pigs as donors and nonhuman pri- mates, e.g., baboons, as recipients (in a few cases humans as well), a three-phase rejection process develops following the xenotransplantation of a solid, vascular- ized organ. Within minutes to hours after transplantation, the so called hyperacute rejection (HAR)b begins, which can destroy the organ in quite a short period of time. If HAR is somehow overcome, a slower rejection process, the delayed xenograft rejection (DXR, or acute vascu- lar rejection) follows, which ruins the organ in several days.",

            "text": "are those that relate to the issue of introducing a problematic degree of humanness into the non-human animal, and in synergy with this the principle for adjudication that is being settled on is that of 'human dignity'.\n\nAt the same time, the animal perspective is excluded from both the governance agenda and its operational implementation. No attention is paid to any problems for the animal that is modified to be more like a human. The focus is entirely on the problems for humans of creating human-like animals. Commenting on the 2005 US National Academy of Sciences Guidelines for Human Embryonic Stem Cell Research recommendation that experiments introducing hESC into an NHP blastocyst should not be permitted, Alta Charo, one of the report's authors, commented that such research 'might humanize animals in ways that are unnerving' (quoted in Scott, 2006, p. 490). In this vein, the question of recipient species is allowed into discussion on the basis that if the animal is closely related to humans, there is less leeway for adding human material before it becomes 'too human' for our comfort. An alternative argument could be made, but is not, that a closely related species is more likely to suffer like us from this experimentation.\n\nThe exclusive agenda-setting power of the emphasis in the bioethical governance discourse solely on problems that accrue for humans is revealed through its sharp contrast with much of the previous debate on the ethics of this kind of research. For example, in debates over the genetic modification of animals, the problem of the possible negative impact on the animal's wellbeing from the gene introduced has been a significant part of the debate (ECVAM, 1998;Boyd Group, 1999, p. 4.2.1;APC, 2001, p. 24). The 'Beltsville Pig', genetically engineered with genes to increase growth rate, suffered a range of disorders including painful bone and joint problems and diminished vision, and was frequently cited as an example of the negative impact on the animal of transgenic technology. The focus on the human also runs counter to existing regulatory frameworks for the use of animals in scientific research. In the majority of countries, these are based on well-established ethical frameworks for animal welfare, with the principle of the '3Rs' (of Replacement of animals where possible, Refine",

            "text": "Xenotransplantation is a clinical biotechnology that has great potential to alleviate the global shortage of organs available for transplantation. However, whilst conventional organ donation involves several ethical questions, xenotransplantation raises several additional novel ethical objections. \n\nThis may be especially the case in the Muslim world, as the animal most suited for xenotransplantation is the pig, and this animal has traditionally been considered impure in Islam. The results of the present study indicate that, indeed, the fact that xenotransplantation involves the use of pig tissue is an obstacle to moral approval amongst Muslims in Egypt. But importantly, the relevant factor is not the level of religiosity itself, but rather, religious identity. Muslims in Egypt seem to be less likely than Christians to morally approve of xenotransplantation, but only when it involves pigs. Likewise, Muslims in Egypt are more likely to accept xenotransplantation if it involves sheep's organs. However, it is important to keep in mind that this study is limited to the extent that the proportion of Christian participants was small (lower than the proportion of Christians in Egypt at large), and therefore, no overly robust conclusions can be obtained. \n\nIt is important to emphasize that the present study is concerned with moral psychology, and it is not a normative treatise. We have sought to examine what participants think about the ethics of xenotransplantation, but we have not sought to examine whether such stances are morally correct or not. Indeed, the ethics of xenotransplantation may be a nonstarter, to the extent that from the onset, such a project may be morally flawed. Even if a particular animal that is not considered impure in any major religion is chosen (say, the sheep) for xenotransplantation, even if we assume it to be ethically acceptable to blur the boundaries between species by creating human-animal hybrids, and even if animal donors are given good treatment and are painlessly killed to procure their organs, some philosophers may make the case that xenotransplantation is still immoral. \n\nPhilosophers have long debated whether it is immoral to eat meat.",

            "text": "Nevertheless, bioethics was born in response to history. A global regime of horrific human subject research from the early to mid-20th century prompted a sharp, introspective examination of biomedicine that saw patients, practitioners, and experts in research, law, and what was to be known as the burgeoning field of bioethics focus on explicit and  implicit rights within the researcher-subject relationship. In the United States, the 1970s saw a radical change in biomedical practice \"from a narrow focus on the physician's or the researcher's obligation to disclose information\" to a new paradigm of patient-practitioner relationships that emphasized the \"quality of a patient's or subject's understanding.\" Notably, this paradigm included newfound rights to \"authorize or refuse a biomedical intervention\" 9 . In other words, these years saw a \"dramatic solidification\" of specific research and care-oriented perspectives, including biomedical researchers' new \"moral and legal duty\" 9 to seek consent from patients. This duty includes a continuous process of providing sufficient information for subjects to establish and maintain informed consent 9 . The purpose of this article is not to provide a comprehensive or even robust history of bioethics. Rather, we refer to this history to highlight the historical purpose of the institution's function: to protect those most vulnerable to potential abuse by biomedical researchers. When examining bioethics' interaction with xenotransplantation, we find the ethical discussion of relevant issues, particularly the utilization and treatment of initial transplant recipients, underdeveloped. Ethical issues concerning human and non-human research subjects within the realm of xenotransplantation ought to be openly discussed with a host of different stakeholders, including the public (comprised of would-be transplant recipients), biomedical researchers, and experts in as many fields that still allow for coherent and progressive discourse. We hope that by identifying ethical areas in need of attention, both the animals and research subjects will meet a better fate than their predecessors. Additionally, if it can truly operate as a panacea for so many preexisting issues within solid organ transplantation systems, xenotransplantation's role in society should be constructed with these sociohistorical consequences in mind.",

More specifically, gene-editing technologies combined with cross-breeding are employed to produce personalized organ generation. The generated organ in tandem with immunosuppression and gene reprogramming constitutes the step preceding xenotransplantation. 7 In the technical field, the formidable barriers to overcome are as follows: a) hyperacute rejection and acute humoral xenograft rejection, happening from minutes to hours posttransplantation; b) initial cellular xenograft dysfunction, presenting from minutes to hours post-transplantation; and c) acute humoral rejection, attributed to coagulation dysregulation and elicited antibody immunity, presenting from days to weeks post-transplantation. 8,9 Nonetheless, even the supporters of cardiac xenotransplantation admit that this method is indicated in selected cases. Pierson et al 10 defined the criteria for cardiac xenotransplantation consisting of 4 principal categories: the risk of allograft failure due to immunologic factors, contraindications for the ventricular assist device, adult congenital heart diseases, and severe biventricular failure without established end-organ failure. \n\nIndubitably, the enthusiasm for new methods that could offer solutions in the treatment of end-stage cardiac failure is elevated. Nevertheless, the technical barriers notwithstanding, ethical parameters should be considered. First and foremost, the transmission of zoonotic viral diseases is a complication that cannot be neglected, especially after the disastrous experience of the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide. In other words, are we ready to take the risk of performing xenotransplantation even though the risk of a new pandemic may arise? Is it ethical to risk the creation of new zoonotic diseases in order to treat cardiac failure in some patients?",

            "text": "The growing public and academic concern about animal suffering in the 1970s led to more strict regulation designed to stop abusive practices, predominantly in high income countries. Even though there are still legal loopholes, and animal abuse scandals still happen in countries that praise themselves for being responsive to animal rights concerns, the animal welfare situation over the past three decades substantially improved in many ways thanks to pressure from retailers, an enhanced focus on meat quality (meat from stress-free animals), and new technologies designed to improve animal welfare. \n\nIn return, animal welfare in low-income countries is still precarious because of the lack of means to implement animal protection measures in the handling, transport and slaughtering of animals, but also because domesticated animals in the Global South still suffer from many untreated 'natural' tropical diseases. Advocacy groups that aim to improve animal welfare in an effective way need to take these empirical facts into account and stop looking down on the actors involved in industrial animal farming and the business with animal-derived products. A much more effective approach is to search for best practices in animal welfare and campaign for their widespread adoption. \n\nMany animal welfare activists tend to lump modern animal biotechnology together with other advanced technologies used in industrial animal management, transportation and trade. However, animal biotechnology is a platform technology with a wide range of specific applications. This makes it hard to compare it with other advanced technologies used at different stages and for specific purposes in the animal farming industry. Moreover, applications of animal biotechnology are scale-neutral in the sense that they may not just benefit the business of animal farming in high income countries but also address certain animal welfare challenges in traditional pastoralist communities in low-income countries in a cost-effective way. Moreover, as illustrated in this paper to some extent, many recent minimally invasive genetic changes in certain domestic animals, enabled through advanced gene-editing techniques, have the potential to improve animal welfare on a large scale. \n\nThese positive developments are not meant to deny that there are real ethical challenges that need to be addressed in animal biotechnology. However, assessing the impact of this platform technology on animal welfare should be guided by Rollin's Principle of the Conservation of Animal Welfare, requiring no increase in suffering, after new traits have been introduced into the genome (compared to the parent stock). It should also be recognized that animal biotechnology may as well help increase the well-being of animals.",

            "text": "Aside from the inevitable immune obstacles in xenotransplantation, numerous challenges also need to be addressed in the use of genetically modified pigs in clinical application. However, rapid developments in transgenic technology and recent remarkable progress in large-animal cloning, particularly the emergence of GTKO/hCRP genetically modified pigs, bring xenotransplantation a major step closer to clinical application. Although interspecies chimeras meet great challenges, we believe that future research developments will lead to the realization of animal-based transplantation medicine. At present, in some European and American countries, pig hearts, kidneys, and livers have reportedly been transplanted to patients that suffered from advanced organ failure. In 2020, GTKO pigs were approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to be a source of human therapeutics including xenotransplantation. In 2022, the university of Alabama reported that a brain-dead decedent was transplanted a kidney from 10-gene modified pig (Porrett et al., 2022). Furthermore, the University of Maryland Medical Center reported that an extensively edited pig heart was given to a dying patient. All these cases marked the clinical application of xenotransplantation from a pig to a human. Although the survival times of the xenografts were relatively short or xenotransplantation was used only as a transition to allotransplantation, hope remains for the use of xenogeneic organ transplantation in the future. The road toward the introduction of clinical xenotransplantation is proving long and arduous, but progress is steadily being made.",

This paper examines the rationale, risks, and costs of xenotransplantation, such as xenozoonoses, creating a new form of industrialized animal farming, abandoning animal ethics principles, and the opportunity costs of investing finite research dollars in xenotransplantation instead of investing in more viable strategies. Alternative strategies that can ethically and effectively address the demand for heart, kidney, and other transplants are recommended: Improving disease prevention and management to reduce demand for transplant organs, improving transplantation methods, and systemic changes to donor policies and organ recovery methods to increase overall supply. Upon careful exploration of the full landscape of organ transplantation, it is considered whether these alternative strategies that do not impose the definite harms and significant risks of xenotransplantation are the most ethical and effective means to increase life\u2010saving options and improve clinical outcomes for patients in organ failure.",

            "text": "Tom Beauchamp and David DeGrazia recently presented a more detailed account of ethical principles for animal research. 13 In their book, Principles of Animal Research Ethics, they outline six moral principles that should govern animal research-three related to social benefit and three related to animal welfare: 1) the principle of no alternative method; 2) the principle of expected net benefit; 3) the principle of sufficient value to justify harm; 4) the principle of no unnecessary harm; 5) the principle of basic needs; and 6) the principle of an upper limit to harm. \n\nBeauchamp and DeGrazia claim that these principles \"can be accepted by all parties who are enthusiastic about the history and promise of animal research and all parties who are enthusiastic about vigorous protection of animal research subjects' welfare-without sacrifice of anyone's basic commitments.\" 14 That is, they seek a compromise between proponents of animal research and those wanting to protect animal welfare, limiting their framework to those values that most people are likely to endorse. 15 Thus, their strategy is to propose principles on which animal research proponents and defenders of the animal cause can converge, with a view to forging a pragmatic compromise that will substantially improve animal research. The upshot is that they provide a rather pragmatic framework for ethical animal research, but are not concerned with the question of what ethical research would look like if animals had fundamental rights. \n\nAs a result, there is still no full and detailed account that fleshes out what animal research should look like if animals have fundamental rights. Accordingly, the aim here is to outline the principles that should govern animal research if we accept the premise that animals have basic rights. 16 he argument proceeds as follows: First, I discuss the fundamental rights of animals. Since the claim of this paper is a conditional one-viz., if animals have moral rights, then the ethical requirements, standards, and principles governing research with humans should be applied to animal research-a clear understanding of animals' rights is needed. If animals have, for example, a right to live or a right to bodily integrity, this will influence what researchers are allowed to do with them. That is, the rights of animals are listed that should be taken into consideration when conducting research.",

Additionally, this does not include the pharmaceutical supports that will need to be developed to prevent the rejection of the organs throughout the recipient's life. Getting the genetic basis of the porcine donor is just one step of many that will need to be perfected to make xenotransplantation a legitimate realworld solution to the crisis of demand for organ transplants. Notably, the xenotransplantation team at the heart of Mr. Bennett's story recalled the difficult biomedical journey that resulted in a transplant-ready xenoheart as \"based on trialand-error over a decade\" with \"many dozens of experiments carried out\" 28 . \n\nSurmounting one of the immunological hurdles previously preventing xenotransplantation from becoming a mainstay of biomedical practice is undoubtedly a result to be celebrated. However, it seems likely that the biomedical focus on donor-to-host immunological response has overshadowed other serious bioethical concerns. Bennett's new xenoheart was not the product of a clinical study. Instead, as stated, it resulted from a unique, singular approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration for an operation on an otherwise poor candidate for traditional transplantation with no alternatives. Other ethical treatments of the Bennett case similarly focus on the welfare of donor animals and the prevalence of zoonosis. In the latter case, the emphasis is still on \"xenogeneic diseases\" and how to account for informed consent given the \"Ulysses contract,\" or a contractual agreement that \"waives the right to withdraw from the clinical trial\" 35 . Discussion of whether Bennett ought to have been the target of this xenotransplantation team, given his markedly vulnerable status, is conspicuously absent. \n\nIt is not necessarily the number of studies conducted that will automatically confirm or deny the permissibility of xenotransplantation from a bioethical perspective. Instead, to be seen as a safe and effective solution to the shortage of human organs for organ transplantation, xenotransplantation science needs to grapple with a greater variety of ethical considerations.",

Different types of diseases progress to the end stage, and organs are no longer able to meet the most basic needs of the body. Despite the use of drugs and conventional surgery, organ transplantation has become one of the most viable solutions to this problem. To date, more than 106,120 patients have required organ transplants in the United States, while only approximately 40,000 transplants were performed in 2021 (data from URL: https:// www.organdonor.gov/statistics-stories/statistics.html). Based on urgent clinical needs, replacing human organs with fully functional animal organs for xenotransplantation therapy is an effective method to address the shortage of donor organs. \n\nCompared with nonhuman primates, pigs have characteristics such as fast reproduction, easy breeding, lower cost, and closer anatomical characteristics and physiological indices to humans, and the use of pigs can avoid the ethical problems caused by the use of nonhuman primate organs (Gao et al., 2021). The use of pigs as donors for pig-to-nonhuman primate (NHP) organ transplantation has become a standard model for preclinical xenotransplantation studies (Klymiuk et al., 2010). However, the clinical application of xenotransplantation still faces many problems: immune rejection of xenotransplantation, abnormal coagulation due to endothelial damage caused by rejection and abnormal growth of transplant donors and biosafety. Gene editing technology has been widely used to solve these problems and prolong the survival rate of organ transplantation. This article reviews the status of xenotransplant organ development and future perspectives.",

Xenotransplantation is a transplant from one species to another. The goal of this program is to develop preclinical pig to NHP models of islet, kidney, heart, lung, or liver transplantation. Genetically modified (GM) pigs offer unique benefits as xenograft donors because they are anatomically and physiologically similar to humans. These GM pigs are developed through an iterative process of gene editing to ensure each gene modification dampens the recipient immune response to the transplanted organ, thus increasing xenograft survival.\n\nResearch supported by the IXCRP laid the foundation for the first pig-to-human heart transplant that took place in 2022. Following the surgery, the 57-year-old male recipient had excellent cardiac function. This initial success has encouraged expansion of both preclinical and clinical research activities. NIAID has supported xenotransplantation research since 2003 and will continue to ensure high scientific, regulatory, and ethical standards in this rapidly evolving field.",

            "text": "Various regulatory authorities have gone to great lengths to find acceptable conditions under which xenotransplantation may proceed, rather than to preclude its development altogether. This is driven by the anticipation that if xenotransplantation will one day be successful, the overall benefits of this procedure will be immense. In principle, an unlimited supply of transplantable grafts could annul the current difficulties of ensuring equitable access to life-saving and/or 'quality of life'-enhancing transplant activities. Proponents will feel that this potential benefit prevails over the unique ethical concerns related to the procedure -including animal welfare and public health issues. However, critical examinations of that anticipation are often left out of the analysis. \n\nIt is reasonable to say that the promise of xenotransplantation is not necessarily convincing. For instance, various arguments have arisen in the literature, which appear to undermine its appeal in terms of 'saving more lives.' A particular problem arises with the possibility that xenotransplantation will turn out to be no more than a temporary solution for patients with end-stage organ disease: a bridge to transplant. That is the primary utility of ex vivo perfusion techniques. The in vivo implantation of solid xenogeneic organs may also prove to be of limited duration, at least during the initial trial phases, if specific immunological rejection and physiological incompatibilities cannot be sufficiently overcome in advance. If xenotransplantation were merely to develop as a bridge to transplant, that would imply that the waiting lists for a human organ would not decrease, rather on the contrary. The same effect is expected for early use of totally implantable artificial hearts, as assessed by the Rathenau Institute. [1] A quantitative simulation model of the waiting list shows that if artificial hearts are introduced and provide only a short-term solution, more people on the waiting lists will die than would be the case if the normal donor heart program continued. This is because recipients of an artificial heart will, at some point, develop an acute need for an allotransplant. Given the urgency of the transplantation, those patients will be given priority on the waiting list, thereby directly lengthening others' time on the waiting list and indirectly affecting their mortality.",

Attitudes were shaped by age, marital status, social engagement, religious beliefs and attitudes toward deceased organ transplants. Respondents from Honduras and Guatemala were significantly more in favor of xenotransplantation [13]. In a separate study of Spanish veterinary students, researchers found that respondents were generally in favor of xenotransplantation [14]. \n\nBlack and white patients with kidney disease and Black and white parents of children with congenital heart disease did not differ in attitudes toward xenotransplantation of hearts. But Black kidney patients were less likely than white kidney patients to accept porcine xenotransplantation in part due to psychosocial concerns about the effect of pig xenotransplantation on the recipient's personality and social interactions. Overall acceptance of pig kidney transplants was still high among Black respondents, with 70% responding favorably [15]. \n\nAttitudes toward xenotransplantation in Asia are influenced unfavorably by Buddhism, Confucianism and Shintoism, but seem to be shifting as scientists in Korea and China become more involved in research on pig xenotransplants of kidneys, corneas and islet cells [16]. \n\nAnimal rights remain a concern. Religious leaders discussed the need for 'Stewardship over creation,' avoiding cruelty to animals in frivolous research. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), an organization opposed to animal experimentation, argued that reports on the xenotransplantation of pig heart and pig kidney 'should serve as reminders that animal-tohuman transplants are unethical, dangerous and a tremendous waste of resources.' The group proposed that presumed consent laws, in which people must opt-out of being considered an organ donor rather than opting in, would make more human organs available [17].",

The XWP acknowledged 'the submissions and discussion at the public meetings raised many significant concerns and identified issues that were not fully covered by the Discussion Paper or were in need of further consideration and discussion' (XWP 2003a, para 2.3). The XWP reported that there were two shortcomings in the initial consultation: (i) many participants only considered solid organ xenotransplantation, and (ii) participants did not represent 'all interest groups' (XWP 2003a, para 1.15-1.16). They noted that there were few submissions from transplant recipients and patients who may benefit from xenogeneic therapies (XWP 2003a, para 2.9). As such, for the second consultation, the XWP engaged the services of a public relations company to promote community engagement and increase public participation. The XWP was also expanded to include new members with expertise in animal welfare, clinical trials regulation and the management of infectious diseases (XWP 2003a, para 1.18). An Animal Issues Sub-Committee (AIS) was formed to address the issue of animal ethics, animal welfare and the use of animals in experimental transplantation (XWP 2003a, para 1.18). The Terms of Reference for the XWP was redrafted with minor modifications (XWP 2003a, para 1.23). A separate Terms of Reference was prepared for the AIS (XWP 2003a, para 1.24).\n\nIn early 2004, the XWP and AIS issued two documents to undertake the second round of national consultation. A plain English guide on xenotransplantation was prepared to provide accessible information for the general public (XWP 2003b). The XWP set out its responses to the initial consultation in a second discussion paper (XWP 2003a). Though the Working Partying acknowledged that xenotransplantation was highly contested, it concluded that 'there are no significant in-principle ethical objections to the use of live organs and tissues from animals for human the",

But animal experimentation is also in itself dilemmatic (Birke et al. 2007), dealing closely with the ideology of \"human exceptionalism\" (Haraway 2007). The overarching dilemma is expressed in how humans use other animals in biomedical and other research to improve the conditions of our own species, on the one hand, and in how we create and employ various forms of governance to control the conditions and limit the suffering of laboratory animals, on the other. Critical scholars have pointed out how the practices of governance and talk about animal welfare can be viewed as yet another excuse or tool for the machinery to work smoothly (Twine 2010). Moreover, each and everyone involved in animal biotechnology must deal with the \"experimental paradox\"simultaneously constructing animals as similar and dissimilar to humans a . Ethical issues regarding the animal/human divide, the boundaries between living/non-living and the matter of animal welfare have at times been widely debated in many European countries and beyond (Harvey & Salter 2012;Urbanik 2007). However, the general trend is a move away from parliamentary and public debate towards institutionalized ethics and technified expert panels, at both the national and EU level. But what does it mean that these complex issues have become reduced to ethical terms that are handled by only a few? In the present paper, we explore what effects such a move can be said to have, and counter by suggesting a revitalized political debate. \n\nOne common feature of novel, bio-medically produced forms of lifebio-objectsis that they are potentially controversial because they challenge societal, institutional, legal and cultural matrixes (Vermeulen et al. 2012). At a policy level, these quite luxuriant entities are often handled and regulated by way of reduction, thus reducing heterogeneity to homogeneity through re-framing, re-categorization and boundary work.",

Over the past 50 years, therapeutic advances and improvements in surgical techniques have increased the number of patients who could survive and benefit from organ transplantation. Unfortunately, the number of organs available through donation has not changed significantly. Thus, there is a growing disparity between organ supply and demand. Although efforts to enlarge the human donor pool have improved organ availability, even a massive expansion in organ donation would not ensure that a compatible organ would be available when and where necessary for a patient in need. Therefore, other alternatives besides expanded human donation are required.\n\nA variety of efforts are making substantial progress in addressing the lack of organs. One area of research that is rapidly approaching clinical reality is xenotransplantation, the use of animal tissues and organs to treat patients [1]. Aside from the potential for creating an unlimited supply of organs, recent advancements in genome engineering technologies allows the genetic modification of animals to produce donor organs which are less prone to rejection for xenotransplantation in human patients.",

However, one of the unique ethical challenges faced by xenotransplantation is that the risk of introducing potential zoonotic disease into the community must be weighed along with the benefit to the patient. While most experts believe that zoonosis is manageable, apprehension over disease transmission from animal donors to human recipients remains a frequent concern of many who are undecided or opposed to clinical xenotransplantation. The COVID-19 pandemic represents a scenario (rapid worldwide spread of a highly contagious novel zoonotic disease with no natural defense in humans) that would seem to justify apprehension, especially in the United States, which has largely avoided previous pandemic outbreaks. However, there are many differences between zoonosis found in the wild or after xenotransplantation that favor the safety of the latter. Still, these differences, as well as the benefits of xenotransplantation, are not widely understood outside of the field. We must therefore ask what impact the COVID-19 pandemic will have on attitudes toward xenotransplantation.",

The risk for unrecognized pathogens is present but ill defined.\n\nSurveillance for the transmission of known or unknown pathogens among health care workers must be conducted by monitoring for unexpected or unexplained adverse health events. It is difficult to monitor for the unknown; therefore, surveillance should include notifying the principal investigator's office of any unexplained illness in exposed health care workers, as well as telephone interviews of these personnel every 6 months by the principal investigator's office.\n\nConcurrent with scientific advances in xenotransplantation have been the necessary ethical debates concerning the appropriateness of this endeavor (5). Disputes regarding animal experimentation notwithstanding, the ethical issues raised by many of these debates are strikingly similar to those put forth 25 years ago in reference to the (then new) field of human heart transplantation. Indeed, the timeless nature of these queries itself attests to their essence, for such ethical concerns are appropriate in the appraisal of any new therapeutic procedure in medicine.\n\nCan one ever hope to determine if or when the clinical application of xenotransplantation is justified? The assessment of any experimental therapy, as Fox and Swazey (6) have suggested, should encourage the investigator to address three critical questions: 1) in the laboratory, what defines \"success\" sufficient to warrant advancement to the clinical arena? 2) under what clinical conditions should this advancement proceed? and 3) in the clinical arena, what defines \"success\" sufficient to warrant further evaluation (6)? Providing answers to this threefold inquiry requires a reliance upon defined \"success,\" itself an appraisal of judgment that can only confidently be made in retrospect.\n\nBecause human heart transplantation is now considered by most justifiable for the treatment of end-stage heart disease, I would first like to review the history of cardiac allotransplantation in light of its ability to address the above threefold inquiry. I will also discuss the history of cardiac xenotransplantation with reference to scientific advances made in the field throughout the past quarter century.

The current research studies focus more on porcine endogenous retroviruses. CRISPR/Cas9, a revolutionary gene editing technology that allows the custom modification of almost any part of any genome with unmatched precision and accuracy, has stimulated interest in the field as it offers the possibility to genetically engineer porcine organs and tissues that are virtually riskfree of endogenous porcine retrovirus transmissions [16,30].",

One potential solution to this organ shortage is xenotransplantation using pig tissues. Decades of progress in xenotransplantation, accelerated by the development of rapid genome editing tools, particularly the advent of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technologies, have enabled remarkable advances in kidney and heart xenotransplantation in pig-to-nonhuman primates. These breakthroughs in large animal preclinical models laid the foundation for three recent pig-to-human transplants by three different groups: two kidney xenografts in brain dead recipients deemed ineligible for transplant, and one heart xenograft in the first clinical grade study of pig-to-human transplantation. However, despite tremendous progress, recent data including the first clinical case suggest that gene-modification alone will not overcome all xenogeneic immunologic barriers, and thus an active and innovative immunologic strategy is required for successful xenotransplantation. This review highlights xenogeneic immunologic barriers, advances in gene editing, and tolerance-inducing strategies in pig-to-human xenotransplantation.",

One avenue is the selection of donor pigs with a favorable immune profile. Recent studies have shown that G\u00f6ttingen minipigs exhibit minimal pre-existing antibodies against key AAV serotypes, including complete absence of antibodies against AAV9 in all animals tested. This low immunogenic profile makes them an ideal preclinical model for gene therapy safety studies and as donor animals for xenotransplantation.

            "text": "e 2008).\n\nNon-human animals are thought to share some of the social characteristics of human beings, and human beings are said to share some physical characteristics of non-human animals. Yet, these different notions of similarity and difference create a paradox within xenotransplantation. That is, xenotransplantation rests on a boundary that is supposed to exist between non-human animals and humans, which makes non-human and human the same but different. Herewith the paradox; on the one hand, xenotransplantation relies on the perceived biological similarity of organs between human and non-human animals and yet on the other, xenotransplantation challenges both the biological and social boundary of difference that makes humans separate and different to non-human animals. Hinterberg draws attention to this anomaly in her analysis of regulatory decisionmaking whereby 'regulators and policymakers now find themselves in a curious position. On the one hand, they continue to regulate the estrangement between humans and other animals, but on the other, they support the creation of chimeric life-a form of life that draws into question the very basis of such separations' (Hinterberger 2020(Hinterberger , 1065.\n\nTo demonstrate the xenotransplantation paradox (that is, 'nonhuman animals are the same as humans but different') I begin reviewing research on patient, health professional and public attitudes that have consistently demonstrated negativity towards xenotransplantation (Appel III, Alwayn, and Cooper 2000;Bona et al 2004;Brown 1999;Brown and Michael 2004;Butler 1998;Canova et al 2006;Conesa et al 2006;Cook 2013;Fovargue 2007;Hagelin 2004;Lundin 2002;Lundin and Idvall 2003;Lundin and Widner 2000;Macer et al 2002;Martinez-Alarcon et al 2005;Michael and Brown 2004;Mohacsi et al 1995;Mohacsi et al 1997;Mohacsi, Thompson, and Quine 1998;Persson et al 2003;Rios et al 2007;Sanner 2005;Schlitt et al 1999).

            "text": "From their viewpoint, according to justified need or necessity, and if the benefits overcomes the degree of pain and suffering to animals, they can be used to meet human's needs while treating them properly (28). \n\nHowever, this group believes that transgenic animals' organ transplantation into human is also criticized because it is against the concept of animal welfare (29). \n\nRegarding this concept, two definitions have been given. In the broad definition, animals should be kept safe from some negative factors like thirst, hunger, pain, suffering, and psychological tensions. In transgenic animals' organ transplantation into human, due to series of experiments, much pain and suffering are imposed on these animals during various steps of this technique. In addition, since there is the possibility of virus transference from animal to human, during their life-time, these animals should be raised with special diets and in supervised environments specified for their growths (30). \n\nBased on the broad definition, the goal, in addition to keeping the animal away from negative factors, is to give a chance to animal to show its species-specific behavior and live according to its type. In other words, in this definition of animal welfare, the concept of being natural is highly emphasized (31). Therefore, genetic modification of animals is basically the total destruction of their welfare because the integrity of animal genome is manipulated to create an animal which is different from its natural type. \n\nFurthermore, in order to prevent transfer of any kind of virus, these animals should be kept in a completely quarantined place and be imprisoned. This has caused a lot of ethical criticism, because keeping animals imprisoned in a place that is not similar to its natural habitat, far from any interaction with its kind, takes its chance to live naturally. \n\nThe broad definition of animal welfare is close to the animal right school, so, it seems that welfare of the animals cannot be provided with this definition in most of the farms and labs. For example keeping cows in closed areas, milking them with new machineries and feeding them with concentrated synthetic foods are totally far from their nature, but are practiced in almost all farms and ranching facilities. Same thing happens in all the labs which work with lab animals. In almost all of the animals at homes, lab animals are kept in small cages and are feed with synthetic food.",

            "text": "Philosophers have long debated whether it is immoral to eat meat. A growing number of ethicists claim that it is not moral to eat meat, to the extent that animals are sentient beings (as Bentham famously asserted, \"the question is not, Can they reason?, nor Can they talk? but, Can they suffer?\" [109], and furthermore, meat is not a true necessity for human diet. Another line of reasoning (famously advanced by ethicist Tom Regan [110]) posits that even if the animals are killed painlessly (as may be the case in xenotransplantation), it is still immoral to do so, to the extent that animals have rights, and killing them for the purpose of human exploitation violates their right to life. \n\nBut xenotransplantation is in one dimension different from eating meat, as this technological prospect may indeed be a necessity for the survival of terminally ill people. In this case, xenotransplantation may be more akin to animal experimentation, to the extent that it is a procedure that entails the killing of animals in order to save human beings. Philosophers also debate the ethics of animal experimentation. Some ethicists (such as Gary Francione [111]) think that animal experiments are never ethically permissible; others (such as Carl Cohen [112]) think we should prioritize human suffering above animal suffering (since animals do not have the same moral status, given their limited capacity for moral duties), and therefore, experiments are permissible; yet others (such as Peter Singer in his more recently revised views) are overall very skeptical of the moral permissibility of animal experimentation, but remain open to the possibility, provided the benefits truly outweigh the harms, considering all sentient beings involved in the procedures [113]. \n\nWhile ethical discussions on animal experimentation have been happening for quite some time, xenotransplantation presents a new challenge. For now, it is difficult to predict what the eventual outcome of this ethical discussion will be.",

However, they present profound ethical challenges, particularly in relation to patient consent and the use of animals in preclinical testing. Informed consent is central to safeguarding patient autonomy, yet practical difficulties arise from issues such as patient comprehension, vulnerability, and cultural differences. Animal testing, while traditionally viewed as a necessary component of preclinical research, prompts serious ethical concerns regarding animal welfare and the broader moral implications of causing harm to animals for human benefit. This review examines these ethical dilemmas, tracing their historical evolution, analysing current regulatory frameworks, and evaluating potential alternatives to both patient consent challenges and animal testing. Through the examination of case studies like the Tuskegee Syphilis Study and the Henrietta Lacks case, as well as debates surrounding animal rights, this article emphasizes the need for continuous ethical vigilance and adaptive frameworks that can balance scientific progress with moral responsibility.",

            "text": "The critical shortage of human organs for transplantation is a global challenge, and xenotransplantation has emerged as a promising approach to address this dilemma. Genetically engineered pigs are at the forefront of donor options in xenotransplantation, offering a viable solution to the organ shortage crisis. Advances in gene editing technologies, such as CRISPR/Cas9, TALEN, and somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), have significantly propelled xenotransplantation research forward, enabling precise genetic modifications in pig donors. \n\nThe complement system plays a dual role in xenotransplantation: it is a key player in the immune response against porcine endothelial cells following the binding of anti-porcine antibodies and contributes to ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). Additionally, its involvement in coagulation, inflammation, and the adaptive immune response adds layers of complexity to its function in xenograft rejection. Despite these immunobiological challenges, the advent of genetically modified pigs, alongside an expanding array of immunosuppressants and anti-inflammatory medications, is progressively overcoming the hurdles faced by xenotransplantation. \n\nCurrent genetic engineering efforts targeting complement regulatory mechanisms have effectively mitigated concerns related to complement activation. However, there remains a potential necessity for anti-complement and anti-inflammatory interventions, especially in acute settings, to ensure the long-term success and acceptance of xenotransplantation as a feasible solution to the organ shortage crisis.",

            "title": "Why animal welfarism continues to fail",
            "text": "Despite \"humane\" labels and modifications in cage sizes, more factory farmed animals are being subject to increasingly invasive genetic, physiological and behavioral procedures than ever before (Ormandy, Dale, & Griffin, 2011). Examples include transgenic pigs and sheep who have been genetically altered to express higher levels of growth hormone and move from birth to \"the table\" as quickly as possible (Laible, 2009), and featherless chickens (Wells et al., 2012). \n\nAnother area in which welfarism has been, arguably, unsuccessful is in the use of other animals as biomedical models. An animal model is an animal sufficiently like humans in anatomy, physiology, or psychology to be used in research considered too harmful or risky for humans. The animal model meets a kind of taxonomic equivalency to humans so as to react to manipulation in a way that resembles the human response. We decide through historical consensus that members of other species can be like us in ways that are convenient and yet dissimilar in ways that would be inconvenient if acknowledged otherwise. Therefore, by its very nature, the use of animal models is ethical gerrymandering, creating contorted justifications for the use of other animals as a means toward an end. \n\nDespite welfare regulations at academic, government and private laboratories, and the lipservice paid to \"alternatives\" to animal experimentation and \"regulatory oversight,\" increasingly invasive manipulations have proliferated in basic and applied research around the world (Dow & Lowe, 2012;Nestler & Hyman, 2010;Ormandy, Dale, & Griffin, 2011). Examples include humannonhuman animal chimeras (Behringer, 2007), like mice with human brain cells (Windrem et al., 2014) and pigs used to grow human organs for xenotransplantation (Reardon, 2015; see NIH videocast of \"Workshop on Animals Containing Human Cells\"), and the creation of autism in transgenic monkeys (Liu et al., 2016). While one might argue that without welfare considerations animals would be subjected to even more harmful manipulations, these recent research developments make it clear that welfarism has \"set the bar\" absurdly low.",

In its \"Beitrag zur ethischen Beurteilung der Xenotransplantation im Hinblick auf den Schutz der W\u00fcrde der Tiere\" (2000), (\"Contribution on the ethical assessment of xenotransplantation with regard to the protection of the dignity of animals\"), the Committee had put on record that with xenotransplantation, a special form of integration of alien tissue or cells into a different species, the following main aspects must be given particular recognition: a) the best-case possible benefit (quality of life, survival period) for the organ recipient; b) the distress caused to the recipient animals by experiments in the pre-clinical phase; c) the introduction of a multitude of human genes into the genetic material of the animals and the possible consequences for the latter's well-being; d) the living conditions of the donor animals based on the health status required for the transplantation; and e) the death of many animals in itself.

            "text": "However, it is important not to overestimate the role of religious identity or attitudes towards animals (as measured by the BMAAS) in the moral approval of xenotransplantation. For, as per the results of the regression model in the present study, the strongest predictor of moral approval for xenotransplantation (regardless of the animal) was gender, with males having a greater rate of approval. \n\nPrevious research has established that there are some gender differences when it comes to moral reasoning. Following Kohlberg's moral development stages, some research suggests that women tend to reach higher stages of moral reasoning earlier than men [90,91]. Likewise, some research suggests that women often approach moral dilemmas with an \"ethic of care, \" emphasizing relationships, empathy, and concern for others, whereas men may lean more toward an \"ethic of justice, \" focusing on principles, rights, and fairness [92]. \n\nStudies also suggest that women, on average, may demonstrate higher levels of empathy and compassion compared to men [93][94][95]. This emotional responsiveness can influence moral reasoning, leading to considerations of the impact of actions on others and a tendency toward caring orientations. Likewise, some research indicates that women may be more sensitive to issues related to harm and care, showing a greater concern for avoiding harm to others [96,97]. This sensitivity may influence moral decision-making, particularly in situations where potential harm is a central ethical consideration. \n\nIn the present study, women were less likely to morally approve of xenotransplantation. One possible mediating factor may be attitudes towards animals (as measured by the BMAAS). As indicated above, in this study greater concern for animal welfare predicts reduced moral approval of xenotransplantation. As per the results of the regression model (as part of the mediation analysis), gender also predicts higher concern for animal welfare, with women expressing more caring attitudes towards animals (as measured by the BMAAS). \n\nIndeed, this reproduces some findings of other studies [98][99][100]. Previous research has established that women, on average, may exhibit higher levels of empathy and compassion toward animals compared to men.",

            "text": "provides a chronological overview of the ethical views on animals in different religions and explains that religions, in spite of their differences, converge on some fundamental points, some of which concern our responsibility toward animals. Human superiority over all other creatures is to be understood in terms of caring for creation. Moral questions concerning our treatment of fellow humans are linked to those concerning our treatment of animals. Animal care is an obligation, both moral and religious. Gremmen (2020) argues that an ethics of animal production \"systems\" consists of a Moral Operating System, which consists of an \"internal\" professional \"care\" ethics, an \"external animal\" ethics, and an \"emergent\" ethics in life sciences enabling change by responsible innovation. A Moral Operating System will help scientists, stakeholders, and policymakers to understand, evaluate, and monitor the integration of ethical aspects of agricultural systems. Thompson (2020) focuses on the ethical aspects of factory farms. He states that philosophers have neglected the relationships that establish duties to farmed animals, especially in factory farms. Many philosophers apparently assume that the conditions in industrial facilities are so horrible that the very idea of discussing obligations to them is vitiated by the unredeemable nature of the circumstances in which they live. Even when widely read texts accurately describe welfare deficits, they present a picture which is misleading both as to the extent of these problems and to difficulty of making changes in response to them. Frequently cited welfare problems in factory farms support a case for reform, but it is difficult to see how it would support the claim that what is done to farmed animals is equivalent to torture. Philosophical analysis could actually help improve the quality of life for animals living on factory farms. \n\nThe second section of this special issue starts with the paper of Francione (2020) who argues against the use of meat, while Pulina ( 2020) is defending the use of meat. According to Francione (2020), it is absurd that some animal rights campaigners maintain that we should allow animals the same legal rights enjoyed by humans. A sensible and coherent theory of animal rights should focus on just \"one\" right for animals-the right not to be treated as the property of humans. Recognizing animal rights really means accepting that we have a duty not to treat sentient nonhumans as resources. Pulina (2020) defends the opposite position.",

Local institutional review boards do not have the wide expertise nor the powers necessary to perform this role.\n\nThe control of such trials should therefore be at a national or even international level.\n\nIf genetically-engineered pigs are to be produced, it is important that certain guidelines are established. The transgenic pigs that have already been developed express small amounts of human protein (e.g., hDAF). Although these animals continue to be very much pigs, some have argued that, with each addition of a human gene to the pig genome, the animal becomes more \"humanized\".\n\nThe extent to which the pigs genome can be manipulated such that the animal maintains its identity as a pig is difficult to define and is a mat-ter of debate. The UK Advisory Group on the Ethics of Xenotransplantation concluded that \"some degree of genetic modification is ethically acceptable\" but that \"there are limits to the extent to which an animal should be genetically modified\".79 Ian Kennedy, the chairman of the group stated that pigs should not be \"genetically manipulated beyond a point that w e would regard as intolerable to the animal (a moral point of view, concerned with the 'pigness' of pigs, which comes a point where the pig is no longer a pig and which might be deemed offensive to all).\" Indeed, the breeding of pig-human hybrids that express significant human as well as pig characteristics, if conceivable, would certainly be unethical and should not be attempted. It is likely that some members of society will advocate that \"humanized'' animals should have some human rights.\n\nIt is unlikely that even an optimal xenograft will outperform a human allograft until w e have several years experience with this form of therapy. It would therefore be counterproductive to reduce the number of cadaveric human organs that become available until the results of xenotransplantation match those of allotransplantation. Overenthusiastic reporting of the early results of clinical xenotransplantation must therefore be avoided, as the public interpretation may be that the donation of human organs is no longer necessary.",

Despite the growing knowledge and ability to perform transplants, the shortage of organs means that the number of patients awaiting a transplant is constantly increasing. Xenotransplantation is any procedure involving the transplantation, implantation, or infusion of cells, tissues or animal donor organs, and also body fluids, cells, tissues, and human organs (or their fragments), which had ex vivo contact with animal cells, tissues, or organs into a human recipient. Organ xenotransplantation would give us an unlimited and predictable source of organs and enable careful planning of the surgery and preoperative drug treatment of the donor. The animal that best meets the criteria for xenotransplantation is the domestic pig (Sus scrofa domestica). Pig and human organs show great anatomical and physiological similarities. However, the significant phylogenetic distance results in serious immunological problems after transplantation. Despite major difficulties, the pig is currently the focus of all research aimed towards eliminating the problem of organ shortage for human transplantation in the future. Thus, the challenge now is to overcome interspecies differences that cause xenograft rejection by the human immune system. The solution, therefore, is to modify pigs in such a way that their organs are not rejected as belonging to another species. Advances in genetic engineering have brought scientists closer to obtaining modified animals that would be useful for pig to human transplants. A number of studies have reached the preclinical stage, using primates as model organisms.",

            "text": "inTRODUCTiOn Xenotransplantation is a potential solution for the urgent and steadily increasing worldwide persisting donor organ shortage (1). Since the 1900s, several efforts have been made in xenotransplantation using animal organs derived from pigs, goats, lambs, or monkeys, but none of them were successful (2). Several studies have shown that pigs are the best choice of source for providing the limitless organs on demand for human (3). The four most significant and profound barriers to organ xenotransplantation are the immunologic responses to the porcine grafted organs, namely, hyperacute rejection (HAR), acute humoral xenograft rejection (AHXR), immune cell-mediated rejection, and chronic rejection (4). To overcome xenograft rejection and the barriers mentioned above, several investigations using pig-to-baboon models has been performed (5). Heterotopic and intrathoracic heterotopic cardiac xenograft in a combination with potent immunosuppression therapy have survived beyond 900 days (5,6). Undoubtedly, genetic engineering has been the most important factor in these achievements by producing genetically modified pigs which are more compatible and acceptable for the human immune system. The most recent genetic technique, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-cas9 or CRISPR/Cas9 has been a milestone in gene editing so far, particularly in xenotransplantation (7). This review provides an overview of achievements and perspectives of the newest approach \"CRISPR/Cas9\" that is used to generate organ donor pigs for xenotransplantation.",

            "text": "More work on physiologic issues remains to understand how well the pig kidney will perform in the human G. Bayliss Questions also remain about whether human recipients will respond to porcine renin, erythropoietin and the effects of limiting the pig kidney response to human growth hormone. \n\nMany ethical issues still need to be considered. They cut across several broad categories (Table 1) and touch on the basic concepts of human autonomy, equity, utility and social justice (Table 2). There is overlap and cross-over in the categories. The tables are examples of two ways to consider the issues and to identify potential stakeholders. Figure 1 illustrates the issues from proof of concept through clinical practice and by donor, organ and recipient. \n\nThe first category might be purely societal acceptance. How will different religious and racial groups view the use of pig kidneys in human beings? Will this be a barrier to offering kidneys to members of those groups? Will some hospital institutional review boards refuse to approve the transplants, limiting their accessibility? How will animal rights groups view xenotransplants? How will transplanter centers and potential patients balance the risks of xenotransplantation, like potential zoonotic infections, to patients and the broader society? \n\nThe second category is economic. How much will a xenotransplant program cost and will they only be available at certain centers? Will government and commercial insurers cover xenotransplantation? How will developers of the 10-genetically engineered (10-GE) pigs price organs and what is a fair return on their investment? Will cost make it impossible for people with public insurance or in areas with limited health care resources to receive pig kidney xenotransplants? \n\nThe third category is medical. How many pig kidneys would each recipient need to provide adequate clearance? What will the immunosuppression regimen be? How will other physiologic problems be resolved to ensure that the pig kidney performs adequately in all areas, not just small molecule clearance? \n\nThe fourth category is regulatory/legal. Who will have regulatory say over xenotransplantation? How will xenografts be allocated?",

            "title": "Pig-to-human xenotransplantation: Overcoming ethical obstacles",
            "text": "Humans have long been captivated by the possibility of merging physical features of animals and humans. This is evident in Greek, Roman and Egyptian mythology, in which human-animal hybrids are deeply entrenched. [1] Xenotransplantation, which is the trans plantation of organs, tissues or clusters of specialised cells from one species to another, may seem like a modern extension of this ancient mythology. [2] nterest in animal-to-human transplantation (xenografts) has significantly increased in the last few decades, owing to the limitations on successful human-to-human organ transplantation (allografts) resulting from chronic scarcities of donated human organs, and transplant rejection. [3] Pig organs are of particular interest, and hold enormous potential to mitigate the rising demand for transplantable human organs, by creating a new and vast supply of organs for human transplantation, thereby potentially resolving the crisis of human organ scarcity. [3] till, xenotransplantation raises several ethical issues. While the ethical and regulatory aspects are much discussed in international contexts, there is little work that considers the South African (SA) context. [4] This is problematic, since in SA there is currently no direct legislation or regulation addressing xenotransplantation. [4] To inform potential regulation in SA, we address the ethics of fatally extracting pig organs for transplantation in humans, and argue that: (i) the benefits of the intervention are likely to outweigh the harms, provided harm mitigation strategies to be discussed are employed; and (ii) that the perceived unnaturalness of xenotransplantation ought not be considered an obstacle to its morality. \n\nBefore proceeding, it is important to clarify our scope in three respects. First, our focus is on pig-to-human organ transplantation, rather than xenograft cell and tissue transplantation. This is because the donation of organs appears likely to raise more significant ethical and emotional concerns. Second, our focus on pigs in particular for xenotransplantation is justified by the fact that this is the type of animal source about which there is the most scientific knowledge. The scientific basis for our claim may differ in other animal species.",

Those resources become even more challenging to manage 4 as selecting donors and transplant candidates requires navigating a dangerous, widespread virus. Additionally, consideration for transplant status includes many factors evaluated on both biological and social measures. Transplant programs often rely on judgments about social support for candidacy status 5 and prompt critical ethical questions over whether receiving a life-saving organ should depend on relationships one may (or may not) have in postoperative care. Transplant programs also need to consider that brain death in human donors has significant effects on the soon-to-be-transplanted organs. This illustrates that a system experiencing scarcity also requires intense and efficient management to facilitate timely transplantation procedures. Finally, solid organ transplantation is marred, both presently and historically, by the so-called \"black market\" 6 body brokers exploiting organ scarcity around the globe for immense profit. \n\nThus, the growing interest in xenotransplantation comes as no surprise as biomedical and transplant communities scramble for solutions. Relying solely on human donors to supply human organs creates a system where there are too few organs to meet the demand of a growing population of would-be recipients alongside a host of other transplantrelated disparities. According to the data released by the Organ Procurement and Transplant Network (OPTN) and the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR) 7 , despite the increasing number of successful liver transplants from year to year, the need for liver transplants continues to outstrip the organ supply. Using large animals, such as those in the porcine family, as biological incubators for human organs ostensibly offers immediate solutions to many issues with current organ transplantation practices. Indeed, these interspecies chimeras are often touted as a panacea for the ills and inefficiencies in our current system 8 . \n\nThis brief commentary aims to explore the myriad of factors that have coalesced to bring xenotransplantation to the forefront of medical research. We also aim to apply lessons learned through historical analysis to reveal bioethical concerns that are critically underdiscussed.",

            "text": "The transplantation of organs across differentially raced bodies has elicited questions about the nature of race itself, from both biological and cultural perspectives (Lederer 2008;Park et al 2022). In the case of xenotransplantation, issues concerning race have the potential to expand in complicated ways. While some researchers hail xenotransplants as potentially superior to allotransplants (Hunter 2009), such an understanding fails to take into account social and cultural aversions towards violating the animal-human boundary. It is therefore not clear whether, if given a choice, patients would ever voluntarily opt for a non-human over a human organ. For minoritised groups who have historically been animalised through scientific rhetoric, the stakes of crossing this boundary are even higher (Glick 2018). While the perspectives of minority groups on xenotransplantation have been examined occasionally (eg, Padilla et al 2021 assessed acceptance across different racial groups in the USA), the views of minorities across various social categories and in different countries require more systematic research. \n\nMoreover, we have also observed challenges in the patient selection process for 'compassionate use' (or 'expanded access') candidates for xenotransplantation, particularly in the USA, where requirements for psychosocial support and compliance are biased in terms of class, race and dis/ability. This leaves those patients in a particularly vulnerable position with no alternatives once experimental xenotransplantation is offered (Strand 2023). \n\nOn the other hand, the debate on global justice (Rothblatt 2004;Sparrow 2009), especially concerning the unequal distribution of risks, has diminished with some even now endorsing xenotransplantation development in selected countries (Rothblatt 2023). Nevertheless, the unequal distribution of risks is still possible through the outsourcing of xenotransplantation experiments and trials to parts of the world where regulatory requirements may be less stringent or where the potential economic benefits of offering niche treatments to medical (xeno)tourists may be highly appealing (Cook 2013;Cook et al 2011).",

Xenotransplantation has the potential to offer unlimited availability of pig organs for transplantation, and pig\u2010to\u2010non\u2010human primate models have demonstrated outcomes that may soon justify clinical trials. However, one of the unique ethical challenges faced by xenotransplantation is that the risk of introducing potential zoonotic disease into the community must be weighed along with the benefit to the patient. While most experts believe that zoonosis is manageable, apprehension over disease transmission from animal donors to human recipients remains a frequent concern of many who are undecided or opposed to clinical xenotransplantation. The COVID\u201019 pandemic represents a scenario (rapid worldwide spread of a highly contagious novel zoonotic disease with no natural defense in humans) that would seem to justify apprehension, especially in the United States, which has largely avoided previous pandemic outbreaks. However, there are many differences between zoonosis found in the wild or after xenotransplantation that favor the safety of the latter. Still, these differences, as well as the benefits of xenotransplantation, are not widely understood outside of the field. We must therefore ask what impact the COVID\u201019 pandemic will have on attitudes toward xenotransplantation.",

            "text": "The possibility to create animal chimeras carrying human organs is associated with many and important ethical objections. In our view, these legitimate ethical concerns must be analyzed rigorously and addressed with appropriate technical handling, as discussed in the next sections. Ultimately, properly discussing such ethical issues and finding a general consensus will pave the way for the development and acceptance of this new technique in the patients' interest. \n\nAs a preliminary remark, it must be noted that, to a certain extent, these ethical considerations were raised previously by medical techniques that today are widely accepted and that also allowed the creation of humananimal chimeras. For instance, porcine, bovine, and equine biological heart valves are often implanted in patients with cardiac valve dysfunction and insulin extracted from porcine pancreas is routinely used by patients with diabetes. Is it justified to consider that a pig carrying a pancreas of human origin is a chimera the production of which should be forbidden, whereas a human being with a mitral valve of porcine origin is a permissible chimera? \n\nTo this question, two answers are most likely to be provided, depending on the adopted perspective. Concerning the animal welfare, experimentations on pigs are already strictly regulated to avoid unnecessary animal suffering during research. The fact that chimeric animals are raised for the purpose of human organ culture should not face more ethical debates than raising them for consumption. \n\nConcerning the production of chimeras, some ethical issues are closely tied to medical concerns. Indeed, one main worry is that the retroviruses integrated in the genome of animals could be transferred to humans. Indeed, the effects of these retroviruses might be known in animals, but there is no possibility of predicting what they could cause in humans. The fear is that human tissues produced in animals might be the source of new zoonoses, which brings up the ethical problems linked to the protection of human participants in clinical research to test the safety of such organs [21,22]. Moreover, the impossibility to anticipate the potential risks associated with the transplantation of human organs grown in pigs calls for caution. \n\nIn addition, crossing the species boundaries between humans and animals is a major ethical concern and could represent a source of resistance by the general public [23,24].",

            "text": "Therefore, it contains the risk of the so-called \"therapeutic misconception\", a phenomenon during which the study participants have no other available therapeutic options and believe that they will be personally benefited therapeutically by the clinical trial rather than they will help to generate knowledge and advance the science for certain diseases [40]. In view of that, the risk of therapeutic misconception must be taken into consideration during the informed consent procedure and ensure that participants in the trial fully understand the true benefits of research. \n\nSome scientists have even raised the question about whether it is ethically acceptable to include children in a first-in-human organoid transplantation clinical trial and under which conditions. Of course, these would be children who suffer from severe conditions that predominantly affect children, such as metabolic diseases [41]. In such cases, additional ethical concerns should be considered including the principle of subsidiarity, which demands that clinical research involving children is only permissible if the clinical study cannot be performed in adults. Such first-in-children clinical trial for liver organoid transplantation could be ethically justified provided that certain guidelines are followed and various safeguards are met [41]. \n\nFinally, it is worth noting that organoid transplantation may offer an alternative to xenotransplantation [42]. Xenotransplantation is the transplantation, implantation or infusion of living cells, tissues or whole organs from animals to humans and has been examined as a possible solution to the scarcity of human organ donors, to the illegal trade of organs from living donors and the use of condemned prisoners as donors, which is permitted in some countries. It involves genetic modification of animals (e.g., pigs and non-human primates) so that their organs cause a reduced immune response when transplanted into humans, raising arguments on the welfare of the donor animals. In addition, xenotransplantation encompasses serious safety issues, because of the possibility to transmit infectious agents from animals to human recipients threatening the recipient's health but also public health. Perhaps more importantly, transplanting animal organs into humans raises concerns over whether this changes the human nature of the recipient and whether it violates the integrity of the human species. These issues result in reduced societal acceptability of xenotransplantation.",

            "text": "Preclinical studies provide valuable insight into the safety issues before being used in the human volunteers. Animal welfare is a major concern during the application of xenogeneic products in humans. Since animals' welfare is a major ethical issue, it is considered by regulatory bodies before approving any product of animal origin for clinical use. \n\nAlso, during the clinical trial stages or in long term, the volunteers or the patients and the close contacts should be educated about the chance of infectious disease risks and about how to manage those risks. Moreover, such counseling should also be continued for long term as some infection may take years to get manifested. Also, lifelong surveillance is advised by FDA irrespective of the status of the implant or graft or other xenotransplantation product. \n\nConversely, 3D bioprinted in vitro organs and tissues that are being developed using dECM are expected not to pose potential threat to recipients. This is because the cell and nucleus materials are being removed from the tissue using harsh chemicals during the process of decellularization. However, the regulatory bodies ensure that xenotransplantation is allowed only when there are evidences that show nearzero chance of recipient getting infected and informed consent, and acceptance for lifelong postoperative care from the patient was collected [116]. Nevertheless, stringent regulations will be required from regulatory bodies to monitor the pros and cons for a longer duration.",

            "text": "With recent achievements and the accumulation of experience with xenotransplantation in preclinical research, the first-inhuman clinical trial may be possible in the near future. It is an inevitable trend that pigs modified with multiple genes are to be used as donor animals for xenotransplantation. New gene-editing technologies enable the production of multiple genetically engineered pigs in shorter periods of time and with greater efficiency. Various types of gene-modified pigs already exist, most of which are being tested in preclinical pig-to-NHP xenotransplantation models. In addition, new xenoreactive antigens are continually being discovered (198,199), from which new knockout and transgenic pigs may be generated. Although assessment of current genetically modified pigs combined with immunosuppressive therapy in NHP models is complex and expensive, we agree with the opinion that substantial results should be obtain in NHP models before clinic application. Data and experience based on studies with NHP models suggest that combining various genetically modified pigs with different immunosuppressive therapies is necessary for the effective transplantation of different organs. Therefore, determining the optimal genetically engineered organ-source pig and immunosuppressive regimen strategy in pig-to-NHP models is a key step toward further clinical study.\n\nQuestions regarding the regulatory challenges and ethical concerns regarding clinical xenotransplantation are being asked worldwide. In 2003, the US Food and Drug Administration published comprehensive guidelines for xenotransplantation (http://www.fda.gov/cber/guidelines.htm). Scientists suggest that national regulatory authorities worldwide should reconsider guidelines and regulations regarding xenotransplantation so as to better enable design and safe conduction of informative clinical trials of xenotransplantation when supported by preclinical data (200). The current research makes some progress in meeting the criteria outlined by the recommendations of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation published in 2000 (201). However, it is unclear which regulatory agencies consider current evidence to be sufficient for moving forward with clinical xenotransplantation.\n\nAn alternative potential approach that could alleviate the current shortage of human organs for transplantation is to create human-animal chimeras through various techniques",

            "text": "Kidney transplantation is thought of the gold standard treatment for those end-stage renal disease patients, which will present substantial improvement in quality of life and life expectancy. This procedure, particularly allogenic kidney transplantation, has achieved remarkable success in extending lives (1,2). Nonetheless, the ongoing shortage of available organs for transplantation represents a significant hurdle, failing clinical demand. In response, the medical community has broadened the donor pool, such as utilizing organs from both deceased and living donors, including those marginal donors or undergoing ABOincompatible transplants. Such efforts, while commendable, have not sufficiently mitigated the organ scarcity crisis. This situation underscores the urgent necessity for innovative strategies to augment the organ donor pool. Integrating advanced surgical techniques and anesthesia practices in the transplantation process is also vital, not only to ensure patient safety during these complex procedures but also to potentially increase the viability of organs from the marginal donors for transplantation. By refining surgical and anesthetic methodologies, the transplantation community can enhance post-operative outcomes and expand the criteria for donor acceptance, thereby addressing the pressing demand for kidney transplants (1). \n\nXenotransplantation, the process of transplanting organs or tissues between different species, has emerged as a pivotal solution in the quest to alleviate the organ shortage. Recent advancements in the realms of genetic engineering and immunosuppression, particularly through the use of targeted monoclonal antibodies, have propelled forward the research into kidney xenotransplantation. Experiments involving the transplantation of genetically modified porcine kidneys into nonhuman recipients have demonstrated significant progress, through those extended graft survival times reported (3). These achievements underscore the potential of xenotransplantation to bridge the gap in organ demand. However, translating these findings to human recipients is met with caution, due to the inherent biological and immunological differences, as well as the looming concerns over safety and ethical implications. The journey toward the clinical application of porcine-to-human kidney transplants is fraught with uncertainties, necessitating rigorous investigation and ethical deliberation.",

These concerns stem from the study's complexity, the procedures' invasiveness, and the potential for suffering in NHPs. For the welfare of the NHP, the following points should be considered. \n\nReproductive engineering techniques often involve highly invasive procedures such as oocyte retrieval, embryo transfer, or hormonal manipulation. To minimize distress and harm, these procedures should be performed with the utmost care and precision, ideally under anesthesia or appropriate analgesia, and only when necessary for the research objectives. Effective anesthesia and analgesia should be administered to minimize pain and discomfort, and the animals should be monitored continuously to detect signs of distress or discomfort. Where possible, researchers should explore non-invasive or minimally invasive techniques to gather data, such as non-invasive imaging, blood or urine analysis, and genomic studies. \n\nGenetic modifications (e.g., CRISPR) for reproductive engineering in NHPs raise additional ethical concerns, especially regarding unintended genetic consequences and the long-term impact on animal welfare. Ethical review is crucial to ensure that such experiments are conducted with appropriate safeguards and that potential risks are minimized. \n\nEthical considerations regarding using NHPs in reproductive engineering are complex but crucial. They revolve around minimizing harm, ensuring scientific necessity, and providing appropriate animal care throughout their lives. Ethical guidelines, such as those offered by IACUCs and institutional review boards, exist to ensure that NHPs are treated with respect, their welfare is a top priority, and their use is scientifically justified.

For example, a gene edited pig served as a donor for the first porcine cardiac xenotransplantation which was performed early in 2022 (Graham, 2022;Griffith et al., 2022;Shah and Han, 2022). The recipient of the cardiac xenotransplant survived approximately 2 months and provides a platform for future clinical studies using these gene edited nonhuman organs that would serve as an unlimited organ source for those with terminal diseases (Griffith et al., 2022). \n\nHere, we provide a review of the studies related to cardiac xenotransplantation and blastocyst complementation in the porcine animal model as potential strategies to engineer a suitable organ for transplantation that will have longterm function and decreased requirements for immunosuppressive agents. Additionally, we will highlight the opportunities and the challenges for each of the strategies with the overall goal of engineering organs for research opportunities and clinical treatments.",

            "text": "Some proposed genetic modifications are good both for animals and for people. Making animals disease-resistant can improve their welfare and benefit food production systems (Figure 4). Diseases targeted thus far in genetic research include mastitis (Wall et al., 2005;Liu et al., 2014), tuberculosis (Wu et al., 2015;Gao et al., 2017), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (Burkard et al., 2017), and avian influenza virus (Lyall et al., 2011). Similarly, using gene editing to ensure that cows are hornless (Carlson et al., 2016) or that boars do not develop boar taint (Carlson et al., 2014) can be valuable methods of allowing animals to avoid painful procedures such as dehorning and castration. We can imagine other techniques that might eliminate other painful procedures such as tail-docking, debeaking, or branding. These \"win-win\" modifications are clearly consistent with the principle for the conservation of welfare. \n\nHowever, some genetic changes to animals performed for the sake of human nutrition, sustainability, or economic benefits might result in decreased welfare for the animals. These changes could be morally justified in a manner consistent with the principle \"only\" if the changes were offset by additional changes that result in sufficient welfare improvements. In other words, if one modification results in decreased welfare, another modification results in as great or greater improvement of welfare, then the resulting animals will \"not\" be worse off, in terms of suffering, than the relevant parent stock. Thus, the principle is consistent with, and encourages, genetic modifications specifically designed to improve animal welfare. \n\nPotential proposals that could involve major welfare improvements and hence high potential for offsetting include genetically modifying animals to have reduced capacities to suffer (Shriver, 2009), to be completely insentient, or to have high levels of endogenous opioids. These proposals, if successful, could provide powerful offsets for other types of proposed changes. However, they are at present much more speculative than some of the other proposed modifications above, and serious epistemological challenges would need to be overcome in order to be certain that the welfare of animals was truly improved by such modifications.",

This role of ethical oversight is especially important if the cell donors themselves have little interest in the informed risks or harms in animal welfare. We believe the same principles should apply to future brain organoid research.12 A donor who is informed about the details of a particular brain organoid study may willingly accept the high degree of moral uncertainty based on their own moral standards. However, this does not reduce the moral uncertainty of the research itself. Thus, respecting donors' autonomy is not the sole problem in the consent procedure for brain organoid research. What is overlooked is the problem of consenting to unethical research, which makes the donor complicit. \n\nWithout adequate consideration for the possible welfare of the brain organoids, donors may have a moral reason to refrain from donating their cells. Again, drawing an analogy with human-animal chimera research is helpful. Individuals may have firm moral views related to the moral status of chimeric animals, that ought normally to be respected, and information relevant to these must be provided. However, suppose a cell donor is informed that the creation and use of chimeric animals will cause harm to them, but there is no consideration for the animals' welfare. The donors may still agree to donate cells to this study based on their own moral standards, but they should not do so in this case. There are moral reasons for the donor not to donate their cells, leading to unjustified harm to the animals. To prevent donors from becoming complicit in unethical research in such a way, researchers should inform donors that the welfare of the animals will be appropriately considered and implement measures to ensure their welfare. \n\nWe believe that the same should apply to cell donation for brain organoid research if future brain organoids become more mature and more likely to possess consciousness. Donors must be fully informed that measures will be taken to minimize potential harm to the organoids. This provides another reason for project-specific consent rather than broad consent. 13 If individuals have not been informed of such measures, they should not donate their cells to such research, regardless of their beliefs regarding the moral importance of brain organoid consciousness.",

It has long been heralded as the ultimate solution to the overwhelming shortage of human organs available for transplantation (1). The concept of utilizing nonhuman organ and tissue sources to meet the overwhelming demand on conventional donors has captured the attention of clinicians, scientists, healthcare providers, and patients alike for many decades but has also been a concept for hundreds of years (Figure 1). As can be seen in Figure 1, which is a timeline of some of the major landmarks in the journey of xenotransplantation. The first published attempts of xenotransplantation occurred with xenotransfusion occurring in the 1600's then in the 1800's xeno-skin transplants were attempted prior to more ambitious attempts at kidney xenotransplantation. There has been a long line of endeavor as advancements in medical science and technology have brought the prospect of xenotransplantation closer to reality. Importantly the ethical and legislative landscape surrounding this pioneering field has undertaken renewed and ever-increasing attention but still requires ongoing updates (2)(3)(4). A large effort from the International Xenotransplantation Association (IXA) in conjunction with others such as the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Transplantation Society (TTS) have been constantly undertaken, however as the field progresses more needs to be done from a broader international and national regulatory perspective. \n\nXenotransplantation offers us the potential to save countless lives by providing a readily available supply of organs, tissues and cells, significantly reducing the waiting time for transplants, and alleviating the suffering of patients on transplant wait lists. It is also a major means by which we can actively abolish the trade in trafficked organs and organ transplant tourism. However, with this promise comes a complex web of ethical considerations and legal frameworks that must be carefully navigated to ensure the responsible and ethical translation of xenotransplantation from the laboratory to the clinic.",

            "text": "Xenotransplantation is described as any procedure that involves the transplantation, implantation, or infusion of the recipient (in this case, a human) cells, tissues, or animal organs. In addition, it also covers therapies that use human body fluids, tissues, organs, or cells that have come into contact ex vivo with animal organs, tissues, or cells. Xenotransplantation was first mentioned in 1667 in the context of the xenotransfusion of blood from a lamb to a human [57]. Many clinical trials of the use of animal organs have also been documented. One of them was a transplantation of a rabbit kidney to a human in 1905 [58]. Due to the phylogenetic proximity of non-human primates (NHPs) to humans, several studies were carried out in 1920-1990 using the kidneys, hearts, and livers of these animals [59]. As a result, however, the use of primates in xenotransplantation research was withdrawn due to the existing ethical concerns, the high risk of transmitting infectious diseases to humans, difficulties in reproducing these animals, and differences in organ sizes [60]. \n\nSince the 1990s, researchers have tried to use pigs as model animals in xenotransplantation research. The domestic pig (Sus scrofa f. domestica) is currently considered to be the most suitable candidate species. The reasons for selecting a pig as a donor animal include the relatively large litter size and short maturation period, the size and physiological similarity of its organs to human organs, and the low risk of xenozoonosis transmission [52,61]. However, there are discrepancies between pigs and humans which lead to the development of immune barriers that prevent a direct xenotransplantation. These differences lead to xenograft rejection [62]. Thanks to genetically modified pigs and immunosuppressive therapy, the survival outcomes of xenografts in primate recipients have improved significantly in preclinical xenotransplantation models.",

            "text": "Due to the ever-increasing gap between supply and demand for transplantable human organs for transplantation, over the past three decades, the xenotransplantation community has focused its research efforts on developing a viable alternative to allotransplantation [1,2]. Scientific investigation has been undertaken in parallel with the development of guiding ethical principles and evidence-based regulatory oversight as the basis for building a logical, safe, and efficacious path to the clinic [3]. Both scientific research and regulatory guidance efforts have been focused on the goal of developing a readily available, predictably efficacious, affordable technology for worldwide application [4,5]. \n\nScientific advances have occurred on a number of fronts as the result of a concerted effort primarily led by members of the International Xenotransplantation Association (IXA) to usher xenotransplantation to the clinic. Pre-clinical testing in nonhuman primate (NHP) models has sought to define the most appropriate genetic characteristics of source animals for each proposed xeno organ, tissue, or cell type, and in some instances required development or adoption of supportive technology platforms (e.g., ex vivo heart perfusion for ischemia minimization) [6,7]. In addition, increasingly effective immunosuppressive protocols and herd and donor health screening protocols have been developed [8], piggery practices refined, and animal facilities built to enable efficient production of \"designated pathogen free\" animals and organs [9]. In parallel, IXA, in consultation with the Transplantation Society (TTS) and the World Health Organization (WHO), has contributed to the development of the appropriate regulatory guidances and standards around the globe for more than 25 years [10]. The journey undertaken over this time has not been without hurdles. For example, in the 1990s the risk that pandemic infection (\"xenozoonosis\") might occur as the result of xenotransplants from NHPs or pigs resulted in government moratoria preventing clinical xenotransplant trials. Here, we describe the positive advances that have enabled and justified advancing to the clinic.",

However, there are a number of ethical, legal, and social issues to consider, and it is necessary to know the public attitudes regarding them.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA Computer Aided Web Interview consisting of 22 questionnaire items was conducted to investigate the attitudes of Korean related to xenotransplantation. Participants were selected from Hankook Research MS (Master Sample) panel. A total of 1007 sets of data were finally collected and analyzed with SPSS. A statistical analysis was performed using an independent t-test and chi-square method.\n\n\nRESULTS\n72.9% of the respondents were positive about xenotransplantation, while 22.2% negative. 61.7% said that they would accept xenotransplantation for incurable diseases. 64.4% agreed with genetically modified pigs for organ resource. 61% agreed that the brain dead could be transplanted first for research purpose, while 32.7% disagreed. The ratio of response that the risk of zoonotic infection is important was 97.2%; the safety issue due to immunosuppression 98.7%; the human identity issue after transplantation 67.4%; and the animal right issue 51.6%. Men were more favorable to xenotransplantation than women on all but one item (stigmatization). There was no significant difference between religions except for the human identity issue.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nKorean people are favorable to xenotransplantation as a therapeutic option and also positive with the use of pig even genetically modified in spite of the issue of animal rights. They are also positive with the idea of using the brain dead as study subject for xenotransplantation, which is currently forbidden in Korea.",

In this sense, it is intended to assist in the ethical analysis of the potential benefits of the technique, in light of the questions inherent to its research and possible implementation. On the one hand, xenotransplantation has the potential to solve the chronic shortage of human organs for transplantation, reducing deaths resulting from the lack of organs and the waiting lists. On the other hand, it raises several issues that must be widely analyzed and democratically debated by society, such as: the risk of xenozoonosis, the use of non-human animals, the limitation of the privacy of recipients of organs of animal origin, collection protocols of free and informed consent and the use of brain-dead patients in experiments. Thus, it is concluded that, even if clinical obstacles are overcome in the future and it is possible to successfully perform xenotransplantation of organs, it is essential to carefully evaluate the pros and cons before deciding on its continuity.",

            "text": "So far, we have resisted the claim that the Non-Identity Defense undermines donor-based concerns. In concluding, we will question the way the debate over xenotransplantation often proceeds, and draw attention to some important recipient-based concerns. \n\nAdvocates of xenotransplantation often proceed by balancing the life that a transpig owes to xenotransplantation against the lives of a larger number of human persons. Others more critical of xenotransplantation focus on the practice more generally. They attend to the risk to recipients as well as the harms to donors it generates, and contrast the practice with some alternative practice, like cell-printing or scaffolding, that reduces those risks and harms. When evaluating the case for a moratorium on the use of transpigs, we should not only weigh the certain harms and their possible justifications in terms of non-identity, self-defense, or human need, as we have done here so far. In addition, we need to adopt a more general perspective, and take into account at least the following factors. \n\nFirst, we must attend to risks not only to donors and recipients but also to third parties, whether human or not, who may face, for example, zoonotic risks. Second, we need to focus on xenotransplantation procedures not only in their perfected form but also consider the moral and non-moral costs involved in their development, including the large number of discarded transpigs and failed transpig transplants that will take place as the procedure is refined. Third, we must not assume that procedures will always take place in conditions of perfect compliance with the relevant rules and protocols but assume human failure and human misconduct will sometimes take place. Fourth, we must consider the practice not only within a single research center or even a single country [39]. \n\nFor example, we may feel confident that our own governments will prohibit transpig xenotransplantation until the technique is perfected and will never permit the use of pigs that have not been properly edited, thus risking zoonotic contamination. Nevertheless, we cannot be certain how all governments will act.",

            "text": "The improved life expectancy of humans over the past decades has increased the prevalence of a growing number of chronic diseases 1 . The increasing application of organ transplantation, the last resort and definitive treatment for endstage organ failure, has resulted in a disparity in the supply and demand for such organs 1 . Therefore, xenotransplantation has become an appealing solution to overcome this obstacle 2 . The U.S. Food and Drug Administration defines xenotransplantation as \"any procedure that involves the transplantation, implantation or infusion into a human recipient of either (a) live cells, tissues, or organs from a nonhuman animal source, or (b) human body fluids, cells, tissues or organs that have had ex vivo contact with live nonhuman animal cells, tissues, or organs\" 3 . Currently, xenotransplant use has been reported mainly for the kidneys, hearts, livers, skin, and corneas 4 . \n\nPigs are the species of choice to harvest organs for xenotransplantation, as they have anatomically similar organs to humans and are suitable for genetic modification 5 . They are highly bred and often consumed, clearing the way for the ethical decision to use pig organs to treat human diseases. Although the genetic discrepancies between humans and pigs are greater than those of primates, the use of primate organs is not sustainable for ethical reasons and because most primates are considered endangered 5 . Furthermore, primate organs have a substantial chance of carrying viruses that can infect humans 5 . Hence, genetic engineering techniques have been developed to decrease porcine and human genetic dissimilarities 1 , paving the road for the usage of pig organs for xenotransplants. Indeed, recent studies described two successful cases of kidney transplants from pigs in brain-dead patients 6 , and another reported a successful case of a heart transplant from a pig to a human 7 . These breakthroughs marked a great milestone for the field of xenotransplantation. \n\nThe main obstacle facing xenotransplants is immunological reactions. Although the mechanism behind hyperacute rejection (HAR) in the xenograft is well defined, the mechanisms of acute cellular rejection are not fully understood 2 .",

            "text": "ignificant immunological and technical limitations, ethical and moral implications, and clinical, public health, and environmental risks restrict xenotransplantation as a viable, mainstream treatment for organ failure. A more careful, balanced, and holistic consideration of these limitations is needed to critically reevaluate and inform the direction and sensibility of pursuing xenotransplantation. Such analyses have been carried out previously, [14,15] but the state of xenotransplant science has the practice closer to clinical trials than ever before and urgent action is needed to mitigate risks and costs. Although xenotransplant kidneys, hearts, pancreatic islet cells, and livers are currently being developed, we use heart failure as an example to explore the immunological, ethical, and economic limitations of xenotransplantation and examine alternative solutions to the transplant shortage that should take precedence. \n\nWe explore how xenotransplantation poses risks for individual human recipients and for public health due to the risks of xenozoonoses-infectious disease transmission from one species to another via xenotransplant; how it requires harm to nonhuman animals both in research and throughout its clinical implementation, and as it scales, how it will necessitate environmental impact; and how the significant investment in xenotransplantation will impose opportunity costs of diverting finite public and private funds away from the development and implementation of more viable strategies. Transplantation and xenotransplantation are both intended to treat end-stage organ failure caused by chronic diseases like coronary artery disease, adultonset diabetes, emphysema, and cirrhosis, many of which are preventable. Instead of concentrating attempts to make xenotransplantation more viable, we consider whether investments in proven public health measures that more effectively prevent and manage chronic diseases leading to organ failure would substantively reduce the need for transplantation in the first place. Finally, we propose more immediate strategies that should continue to be prioritized to improve outcomes and access for patients waiting for organ transplants, as well as specific policy changes that can dramatically improve the availability of human donor organs.",

Although man is concordant with old world primates, and the choice of this species would be an obvious way to prevent hyperacute rejection, there are several good reasons for preferring pigs to primates (Table 1). Therefore, concerns for future maintenance problems should be related to the pig. It can be questioned whether maintenance conditions of the transgenic xenograft donor pigs will differ significantly from non-transgenic pigs. Due to the fact that a xenograft donor pig is not yet fully available, little factual knowledge about this issue is available. However, in relation to a future xenograft donor pig basic and applied research has already created knowledge usable for the prediction of its health and welfare. Transgenic knock out mice partly equivalent to a future donor pig have existed for years, and basic knowledge on the function of the strategic transgenes is also available. Therefore, essential information on the impact of these modifications may be achieved by combining this information. Basically, these will be reared and cared for as for other pigs, but two considerations may make the maintenance principles different. Firstly, transgenesis may have induced new health and welfare problems in these pigs, and secondly, the specialized use of the pig may induce new hazards to the xenograft recipients and even to mankind, as such.",

The Group concluded that \"genetic modification may contribute to human wellbeing and welfare, but is acceptable only when the aims are ethically justified and when it is carried out under ethical conditions.\" 34 \n\nIn conclusion, the animal breeding industry sector is not extensively regulated, as compared to say the pharmaceutical industry. Regulation is not a barrier to entry into the animal breeding industry in the sense that it can be in the pharmaceutical sector. However, any novel foods derived from GM animals are likely to have a considerable regulatory hurdle to overcome. Animal welfare legislation is an issue with which the animal breeding industry is already familiar, but it is not clear how it is being applied in animal agriculture. Another regulatory aspect relevant to animal breeding is the issue of ethical acceptability and it is not clear how this will be resolved.",

There is general consensus that the porcine species is the species of choice, based on a number of factors including that in many organ systems, the physiology of pigs and humans is remarkably similar. Pigs can be bred and maintained in large numbers within enclosed, biosecure facilities, with large litter sizes being in order of ten piglets or more, time to sexual maturity being short (about 6-8 months), and gestation time being less than 4 months. Genetic engineering techniques have been developed and are being used to modify pigs via transgenesis, gene modification, and gene knock-out (KO) technologies 2,3 to reduce immunogenicity and potentially improve safety. 5][6] As a result of these factors, a porcine-derived replacement pancreatic islet cell xenotransplantation product has now been used in patients with diabetes under national regulatory oversight [7][8][9] demonstrating both safety and efficacy. 10 ere are stringent guidelines issued by regulatory agencies including the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding the generation and production of pigs for Xenotransplantation. 11 Originally, the term specific (or specified) pathogen free (SPF) as it relates to swine production was not specifically created to help researchers but for pork producers to economically raise healthier animals under the premise that if the disease load can be lightened, better health and growth performance can be achieved. 12",

This, however, raises some concerns, as the relatively high level of compatibility means that some baboon and chimpanzee viral pathogens can infect people (Smor\u0105g and S\u0142omski 2005). Moreover, the breeding of monkeys is more demanding. Their fertility is much lower and gestation longer in comparison to pigs, which have turned out to be the optimal animals. Furthermore, public discourse attaches great importance to religious issues. The three monotheistic religions (Judaism, Christianity and Islam) accept xenotransplantation, allowing the use and modification of nature (including the animal world) if this serves the development and welfare of humankind. Humans have the right to intervene in the work of God. Moreover, Islam and Judaism accept pig xenotransplantation, because they do not see this as the consumption of meat, but as a considerable advantage resulting from using animal organs (Smor\u0105g 2011). \n\nIn the Catholic Church, already in 1956 Pope Pius XII spoke of xenotransplantation in his address to the Italian Corneal Donors Association and the Italian Blind Association, stating that it is acceptable when the transplanted organ does not violate the recipient's mental and genetic identity, and the risk associated with the procedure is relatively small (Knia\u017a 2005). Nonetheless, it should be stressed that the Catholic Church has spoken against xenotransplantation in relation to gonads and brain cells (Smor\u0105g 2011). Some other religions, for instance, Buddhism and Hinduism, have different perceptions of the relationship between humans and animals, whilst concerns regarding animal organ transplants are left to the believers' individual judgement. In addition, cultural factors play a significant role in the acceptance of xenotransplantation in countries where post-mortem allotransplantation is not possible from a social point of view.",

            "text": "In this lecture xenotransplantation is considered from the point of view of animal ethics. The main point is to show that a specific cluster of arguments commonly used in favour of xenotransplantation, simplifies the ethical questions involved. This simplification may be favourable for political reasons in a short time perspective, but may at the same time be disastrous from an ethical point of view in the long run. If the ethical questions regarding xenotransplantation are reduced to a simple yes or no, this will overshadow more important questions of how xenotransplantation may be implemented in an ethically responsible way. Resisting this simplification, we have to explore instead the necessary conditions under which xenotransplantation may be carried through or rejected. Ethics is often expected to deliver simple answers to complex questions. The bottom line of an ethical argument is expected to say yes or no. This way of understanding ethical contributions to the public and scientific discourse about xenotransplantation, or any scientific and public discourse, is however not in accordance with the ethical point of view. People who expect simple and clear-cut answers to moral questions do not or at least not always \u2013 expect these unambiguous answers because they want ethics to be of importance to the questions involved. Very often they expect unambiguous answers for the opposite reason. They want clear-cut answers just to get rid of ethical considerations. When ethics is reduced to a simple yes or no, then it is of no use and not worth taking into consideration. So ethics is from this point of view trapped in a \"catch 22\". If it can't deliver simple answers, it is of no use, and if it delivers simple answers, it certainly is of no use. Contrary to the demand for simplicity I therefore want to say, using the words of the poet Soren Kierkegaard, \"that in this day and age when everybody is striving to make everything more easy, my task is to make everything more difficult\", or at least as difficult as possible within twenty minutes. I am not doing this because I love difficulties, but because I think we have to consider more deeply what xenotransplantation is all about. Putting something into action, there is a world of",

Genetically modified pigs have been considered as potential animal donors for human xenotransplantation and have been widely used in preclinical research. The genetic modifications aim to prevent the major species-specific barriers, which include humoral and cellular immune responses, and physiological incompatibilities such as complement and coagulation dysfunctions. Genetically modified pigs can be created by deleting several pig genes related to the synthesis of various pig specific antigens or by inserting human complement\u2010 and coagulation\u2010regulatory transgenes. Finally, in order to reduce the risk of infection, genes related to porcine endogenous retroviruses can be knocked down. In this review, we focus on genetically modified pigs and comprehensively summarize the immunological mechanism of xenograft rejection and recent progress in preclinical and clinical studies. Overall, both genetically engineered pig-based xenografts and technological breakthroughs in the biomedical field provide a promising foundation for pig-to-human xenotransplantation in the future.",

This requires, among other things, major embryo-technological efforts, and the rate of success is still far from an acceptable level in the domestic species. It is currently poor, but the progress is very good. In this brief review certain embryo-technological problems will be addressed with the focus on the pig as potential organ donor. In addition, certain views of the Danish ad hoc Committee on Gene Technology on xenotransplantation will be presented in this context as they are supposed to mirror the concern and the views of the issues important for the public and each individual.",

            "text": "Organ failure is a major public health and economic burden that increases mortality and reduces quality of life. Organ transplantation has become the standard of care for many patients with organ failure, but for the more than 100 thousand patients waitlisted for organ transplants in the U.S. and the millions of people with organ failure who are not on a waitlist, demand greatly exceeds supply. [1,2] pproaches to mitigate the organ shortage include increasing organ donations (both deceased and living), improving organ preservation methods and increasing the recovery of organs after cardiorespiratory declaration of death, improving organ transport, increasing acceptance of expanded criteria organs, and improving post-transplant outcomes to reduce the need for re-transplant. Current levels of investment and attention to these approaches have not sufficiently increased supply. Cross-species transplantation-xenotransplantation-of solid organs has been studied for decades with no definitively successful outcomes in human recipients due to formidable immunologic barriers. [3] Recent advancements in genetic engineering and immunosuppression have led to increased investment in nonhuman animals as a possible source of organs. [6] The first heart xenotransplant took place in March 2022. The patient died 60 days after transplant. [4] n September 2023, a second xeno-heart transplant was performed in a living patient who survived just over five weeks. [7] n March 2024, the first genetically engineered pig kidney transplant was performed in a living person, but despite surgeons' belief that the organ \"would last for at least two years,\" the patient died in May. [8,9] In April 2024, a second xeno-kidney transplant of this kind was performed, but heart-related complications led surgeons to remove it 47 days later, and in July, the patient died. [10,11]  flurry of press and medical commentaries primarily cast a favorable light on the technique, touting its promise to solve the organ shortage while failing to adequately question whether it can be done safely or ethically. [12,13] ignificant immunological and technical limitations, ethical and moral implications, and clinical, public health, and environmental risks restrict xenotransplantation as a viable, mainstream treatment for organ failure.",

            "text": "In The Case for Animal Rights (Szewczyk 2009), Regan notes that all sentient beings have basic rights and interests that should not be violated. Most importantly, making such beings suffer should not be allowed, and subsequently, people are obliged to take care of animal welfare. Accordingly, Regan believes that anthropocentric research on animal enhancement excludes the animals' basic rights. \n\nYet another approach supports the priority of human interests over animal rights. Consequently, researchers can use animals but should minimise their suffering and reduce their numbers in experiments (Szewczyk 2009). The proponents of experiments on animals believe that most achievements in medical sciences up to the late 19 th century would not have been possible if biomedical research did not use animals (Mephan 2008). Subsequently, animal enhancement leads to an important gain for humans. The organs grown on humanised animals can considerably improve the quality of life of people awaiting transplantation. \n\nAs a tenet of the Anthropocene, endeavours to adapt Earth to meet human needs include the adapting of non-human animals. The ethical assessment of this phenomenon will depend on the actual advantage for humans, caring for the modified animals' welfare and the ecological impact of such organisms on the environment. \n\nAnother problem is the fluidity of transition between bodies. Human cells are implanted in other animals, allowing to grow organs used in transplantation or to increase the efficacy of tested therapies in humans. With this approach to genetically modified animals, an appropriate concept would be that of \"biopower\" used by Foucault and Donna Haraway. \n\nThe latter compares the hierarchy of organisms to patriarchal or oedipal family narratives (Haraway 1997;Braidotti 2006). This understanding of speciesism constitutes an important rationale in contemporary philosophy. In their undefined status, the concepts of \"cyborg\", \"coyote\", \"trickster\" and \"oncomouse\" disrupt this discourse. \n\nHaraway sees the oncomouse as a technical body par excellence: it was created to serve profitable trade between the laboratory and the market, between patent offices and research centres (Haraway 1997). On the other hand, Haraway emphasises the kinship between transgenic animals and humans by calling the oncomouse her sister (Haraway 1997).",

            "text": "Xenotransplantation explores transplantation of organs between different species. Leonard Bailey at Loma Linda University performed the first cardiac xenotransplantation in 1984, transplanting a baboon's heart into an infant with hypoplastic left heart syndrome. The baby survived only 12 days, and ultimately died of multi-organ failure. Initially, the function of the transplanted organs was limited to only days or weeks, due to the powerful response of the human immune system against nonhuman donor antigens that could not be overcome by standard immunosuppression methods. 96) However, with increasing numbers of patients in end-stage HF and the shortage of donors, there has been a renewed interest in the possibility of cardiac xenotransplantation. Advantages include an unlimited supply and elective availability of donor organs, expansion of the candidate pool, and avoidance of the detrimental effects of brain death on donor organ function. 65)97)98) Although monkeys and baboons are most phylogenetically like humans, given the ecological and ethical restrictions, the pig is the only animal available to replace human tissues. The pig is physiologically similar to humans and its organ sizes are comparable. Pigs can be raised in controlled environments and, more importantly, can be genetically modified. The main limitations to xenotransplantation are rejection, including hyperacute, acute, and chronic vascular forms, and the risk of transmitting zoonoses. The development of genetically-modified pigs has allowed for the expression of human antigens that can reduce the risk of rejection and provide hope for future feasibility. With the introduction of galactose-\u03b1-1,3-galactose (Gal)-knockout pigs, prolonged survival especially in heart and kidney xenotransplantation, was recorded. However, remaining antibody barriers to non-Gal antigens continue to be the hurdle to overcome. The production of genetically engineered pigs was difficult and required a significant amount of time. However, advances in gene editing, such as zinc finger nucleases, transcription activator-like effector nucleases, and most recently, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) technology have made the production of genetically engineered pigs easier and available to more researchers.",

This outcome hinges on whether xenotransplants prove to be on par, inferior or superior to allografts. However, the outcome also rests on whether potential allotransplant donors (cadaveric and living) will see human organ donation as necessary given the availability of animal sources. In addition, bereaved families who endure significant pain when agreeing to the organ transplantation of a deceased family member (Ralph et al 2014) may decide against it if an alternative becomes available. This would inevitably reduce the availability of organs rather than increase them even if xenotransplantation is viable. Furthermore, it is uncertain whether hierarchies of patient accessibility to allo-and xenografts will arise (eg, as shaped by socioeconomic disparities or insured status). \n\nOperating at the extremes of the possible, xenotransplantation-besides creating human-animal hybrids that evoke various transhuman and posthuman imaginariesalso introduces a new type of social figure: The brain-dead individual who is sustained for the sole purpose of experimental xenotransplant trials. This individual is not merely an 'organ donor' but rather a body or corpse 'donor', representing a socio-technologicallegal construct used as an alternative to nonhuman primates as an experimental research model. The consequences of this trajectory require careful consideration and further research, including various stakeholders and affected groups involved (Parent et al 2023). \n\nLastly, we anticipate ethical questions related to the role and use of animals, which some may perceive to be resolved to resurface as a matter of public opinion due to the current zeitgeist.",

            "text": "If we want to respect the rights of animals outlined above-e.g., to be free from discomfort, disease, fear, distress and pain, to express normal behavior, and to enjoy continued existence-this precondition restricts what we are consequently allowed to do with them in research. Inducing diseases in animals, for example, would no longer be permissible. Experiments that cause suffering or lead to the death of the animals would be ethically problematic. And so would experiments that severely restrict animals' opportunity to pursue species-typical behavior, such as maternal deprivation studies. \n\nHowever, these restrictions do not rule out other forms of nonharmful animal research. Animals cannot speak up for themselves and give informed consent to their participation in medical research, as they lack the requisite cognitive capacities. For this reason, they share similarities with many groups who cannot consent to research, such as infants, persons in a coma or severely cognitively disabled individuals. On the other hand, these groups should not necessarily be excluded from research, since this would deprive them of all the potential benefits that the research could bring to them. 29 Indeed, we already permit research that involves little or no risk and that is not harmful with groups unable to consent, so long as there is consent by proxy in their best interest. If animals have basic rights similar to those of humans, then the same principle should apply to them: nonharmful and low-risk research with them should be permissible, since a complete abolition of animal research would deprive animals of research results that are beneficial to them individually, or to their species. \n\nEmanuel, Wendler, and Grady lay out ethical research requirements for studies with diverse populations, including vulnerable groups. If animals have rights similar to humans', then we have good reasons to extend these requirements to research animals. Here, I outline how this can be done in practice. Note that three conditions are already required for animal research in most countries, namely social and scientific value, scientific validity, and independent review. 30 While necessary, these requirements are insufficient for ethical animal research. Further elements are needed that (i) guarantee animals' welfare throughout studies and (ii) provide formal requirements for any research with sentient beings, regardless of species.",

This simple argument is, however, not a valid argument for xenotransplantation, as the research touches on many more ethical aspects. Therefore, xenotransplantation research is accompanied by ethical research to evaluate the perception of the different ethical groups regarding the use of pig organs. Pioneering work has been established by the German xenotransplantation consortium. In a survey of representative citizens, the group considered the benefits of xenotransplantation to outweigh the risks but called for strict regulatory measures [89]. Despite animals having been used in scientific research for a long time, the main ongoing concern is the welfare of these animals, ensuring that they live well, feel well, and function well [90]. Therefore, when manipulating the pig genome to create humanized pigs for xenotransplantation, it is essential to carefully assess gene modifications to avoid harming the animals' physical and mental health. \n\nWhen employing human PSCs for human-pig chimeras or directly utilizing humanized pig organs for regenerative medicine, we need to avoid human PSCs contributing to the neurons and germ cells. Efforts could be made to specifically eliminate the donor cell contribution in the brain in interspecies chimera [91]. Such scientific advances are expected to help circumvent the contribution of human cells to the pig brain or germ cells. \n\nAgain, the main argument for an overall positive assessment of stem cell research in general and xenotransplantation in particular in the societal context is primarily based on the societal obligation to help people with life-threatening conditions and to alleviate suffering where possible. The fact that research is well ahead of the public consciousness and that a broader societal debate is necessary and still lacking demands ongoing evaluation and regulation to ensure the responsible and safe implementation of using stem cell-and pig-related products in research and medicine. These research activities, including the generation of gene-edited pigs, must have ethical approval by an independent commission and abide by the local and international regulations.",

The rising incidence of vital organ failure, combined with an insufficient availability of organs particularly from deceased donors, has generated an increasing gap between organ availability and need, resulting in extremely long waiting times for patients on waiting lists. \n\nXenotransplantation, which aims to substitute human failing organs with animal organs, could efficiently solve various organ shortages. Pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus) are currently considered the ideal donor animals for human xenotransplantation (2). Despite similarities between pig and human organs regarding size and physiology, major obstacles to clinical application are due to the immune rejection between species, several physiological incompatibilities and the risk of xenogeneic infections or xenozoonoses. Genetic modifications of pigs have be proposed to overcome most of these hurdles. Recent advances in gene-editing systems, including zinc finger nucleases, transcription activator-like effector nucleases, and the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/ CRISPR-associated protein (CRISPR-Cas) system, allow for rapid insertion or deletion of specific sites by gene editors that reduce the work and shorten the time necessary to create genetically engineered pigs. \n\nThe immune responses for xenotransplants are significantly stronger when compared with allotransplants (Tables 1, 2).",

This study conducted a quantitative analysis of the perspectives of heart xenotransplantation in the treatment of patients with heart disease. The objective was to evaluate clinical efficacy, the immunosuppression techniques used, the results obtained in case studies and meta-analyses, and compare xenotransplantation with allogeneic transplantation methods. The methodology involved a literature review covering the period from 2014 to 2024, using databases such as Scielo, Google Scholar, scientific journals, repositories, and virtual libraries. Initially, 105 studies were found, of which 15 were selected after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria. The results showed that grafts from genetically modified pig hearts can survive for extended periods in non-human primates, with some survivals documented for up to 945 days. Effective immunosuppression techniques, such as CD40-CD154 costimulation blockade and the use of anti-CD20 antibodies, significantly reduced episodes of acute rejection. Practical implications include the potential reduction of waiting time for patients in need of transplants and offering new hope for those with terminal heart failure. However, technical, ethical, and biological challenges still need to be overcome. It is concluded that heart xenotransplantation is a promising field that deserves continuous attention and investment in research to advance towards safe and effective clinical application.",

            "text": "Xenotransplantation (xenos-from the Greek meaning \"foreign\" or strange), [1] [2] or heterologous transplant is the transplantation of living cells, tissues or organs from one species to another. [3] Such cells, tissues or organs are called xenografts or xenotransplants. It is contrasted with allotransplantation (from other individual of same species), syngeneic transplantation or isotransplantation (grafts transplanted between two genetically identical individuals of the same species) and auto transplantation (from one part of the body to another in the same person). \n\nXenotransplantation of human tumor cells into immune compromised mice is a research technique frequently used in pre-clinical oncology research. Human xenotransplantation offers a potential treatment for end-stage organ failure, a significant health problem in parts of the industrialized world. It also raises many novel medical, legal and ethical issues. [4] A continuing concern is that many animals, such as pigs, have a shorter lifespan than humans, meaning that their tissues age at a quicker rate. Disease transmission (xenozoonosis) and permanent alteration to the genetic code of animals are also causes for concern. Similarly to objections to animal testing, animal rights activists have also objected to xenotransplantation on ethical grounds. [5] A few temporarily successful cases of xenotransplantation are published. [6] It is common for patients and physicians to use the term \"allograft\" imprecisely to refer to either allograft (human-tohuman) or xenograft (animal-to-human), but it is helpful scientifically (for those searching or reading the scientific literature) to maintain the more precise distinction in usage.",

            "text": "Historically, xenotransplantation has traversed a challenging path, with initial attempts to transplant animal organs into humans dating back to the early 20th century, notably beginning in 1906 (13). The pursuit of understanding xenotransplantation's complexities led researchers to utilize animal models that have smaller body sizes, despite their significant genetic differences from humans (e.g., a 33.4% nucleotide difference between mice and rats, compared to a 2.6% difference between macaques and baboons). These models, particularly rodents, were instrumental in elucidating the humoral and cellular dynamics of xenotransplantation. Up until 2012, rodents were the backbone of xenotransplantation studies, contributing to approximately 95% of research in the field. The advent of sophisticated genetic editing technologies has recently shifted the preference towards NHPs as models, given their closer genetic proximity to humans, which allows for more accurate simulation of immunosuppressive strategies and rejection mechanisms. \n\nThe utilization of brain-dead individuals as recipients of pig kidney transplants has served as a crucial intermediary step towards clinical xenotransplantation research (14). Although this model has provided invaluable insights, it is limited by the short survival times of the recipients, which restricts the exploration of long-term complications such as viral transmissions or abnormal organ growth (15). Establishing a standardized selection criterion for human recipients of xenotransplant organs remains a work in progress. Proposals suggest prioritizing individuals for whom conventional treatments have failed, or who face long waiting time for allogeneic transplants due to immunological sensitivities, such as a high level of panel reactive antibodies (PRA) (16). However, the selection of highly sensitized patients poses its own set of challenges, including the potential for adverse reactions between pig (swine leukocyte antigen, SLA) and human (human leukocyte antigen, HLA) antigens (16,17). The field of xenotransplantation is at a critical juncture, requiring expanded research efforts to explore not only the scientific and ethical ramifications of these procedures but also the practical aspects of preparing for and managing post-transplant care.",

            "text": "They must acknowledge the sentience of experimental animals and build a positive rapport with them to ensure their wellbeing throughout the process. Going forward, the focus is on ensuring that researchers approach the animals in their experiments with seriousness and compassion, maintaining deep respect for their welfare. This responsibility entails treating experimental animals with empathy and reverence. Moreover, for animals used as donors, such as genetically modified pig hearts transplanted into humans (Mohiuddin et al., 2023), researchers must take on the responsibility of safeguarding these animals and ensuring that their treatment adheres to ethical standards. Although fetal bovine serum is widely used in cell and organoid cultures, and its procurement follows strict ethical and animal welfare guidelines, it still requires researchers to reflect on whether this practice genuinely aligns with animal welfare principles. With the global commercial cattle population estimated at two billion, the question arises whether current alternatives can effectively replace animal-based practices. These considerations call for the application of the Responsibility principle, encouraging researchers to limit animal use and minimize potentially harmful procedures, while still meeting experimental requirements. While the traditional 3R principle primarily focus on technical improvements, they overlook the responsibility of researchers as the direct executors of experiments. In contrast, the Responsibility principle places researchers at the center, emphasizing the impact of their decisions and actions on animal welfare. As the leaders of their projects, researchers wield significant power, with the design and execution of experiments resting entirely within their discretion. Thus, the introduction of the Responsibility principle highlights the human factor behind the traditional 3R principle, prompting each researcher to reflect on their conscience and sense of duty. By focusing on the individual-the decision-maker and executor-true respect for and protection of animal welfare can be achieved, grounded in the Responsibility principle. \n\nAdditionally, the influence of religious beliefs, cultural backgrounds, and political systems on animal experimentation must be considered. Ethics can vary significantly across different cultural contexts, and these differences affect the selection of animals for experimental research. Recognizing such cultural sensitivities, ethnopharmacology has incorporated the Responsibility principle as a key supplement to the traditional 3R principle. Although promoting unified standardized management is challenging due to diverse cultural and political contexts, it is essential to develop approaches to animal experimentation that align with the 4R principles while ensuring the welfare of the animals involved in research.",

Some people hold the view that xenotransplantation inevitably compromises species boundaries and erodes human dignity. Animal welfare groups also opposed xenotransplantation on the grounds that nonhuman animals should not be treated as redesignable systems [30]. In fact, various animal products are already used in humans. For example, bioactive bones from decellularized bovine femoral bone and freeze-dried bone marrow stem cell paracrine factors are extensively used in large-sized bone defects [48]. These achievements are gradually changing the public's outlook, paving the way for xenogeneic stem cell transplantation. However, potential applications must consider customs, laws, religions, and other factors in different regions.",

            "text": "In countries where citizens, veterinary professionals and students may have less familiarity with the pitfalls of certain popular framings of animals' issues, e.g., the \"animal welfare-animal rights concepts and debates,\" or appreciate the subtle philosophical or scientific distinctions or ethical nuances, the language of animal rights and rhetorical arguments used solely to advocate for individual animals may resonate as a good idea at first. However, animal activism may actually harm animals, especially if it is lacking in both scientific credibility (e.g., inaccurate portrayal or obfuscation of what is animal welfare science, cherry picking or incomplete representation of welfare science data) and appreciation for more pragmatic framings of the issues (e.g., dismissing the complexities of how human-animal relationships are \"blurred\" or intertwined [49,50] or deploying blanket solutions that are uninformed by local stakeholder perspectives and knowledge). \n\nAnimal activists can also polemicize debates concerning animal welfare. Polemicized debates frustrate more pragmatic deliberations that, while do not justify current impoverished conditions, are committed to reform-oriented remedies to improve the welfare of animals in existing systems. For example, time in the field with animal producers in largely agricultural communities often reveals that discussions of how to improve the welfare of animals in agricultural systems simultaneously intersect with a number of different factors. These factors include the economic structure of food production, how scientific controversies over how 'animal welfare' are conceived [34], day-to-day economic and moral constraints on producers [51,52], technological capacities of the local agricultural systems [48,50], and tradeoffs between improving animal welfare and benefits to environmental sustainability and planetary health [53][54][55]. Heavy and unfortunate focus on whether animals have rights or are moral persons (narrowly conceived) tends to overshadow inquiry into the welfare of animals and initiatives that can produce real-world solutions regarding how best to improve animals' welfare [56]; see also https://speakingofresearch.com/about/). \n\nIn the abovementioned contexts, veterinarians entering discourses involving animal welfare should be aware of contentious political conflicts that only stoke conflict and do not offer genuine solutions to remedy unnecessary and avoidable animal welfare deficits.",

            "text": "Do animals have moral rights? What kind of legal status should we afford them? The debate on these issues has become very confused. Some animal rights campaigners maintain that we should allow animals the same legal rights enjoyed by humans (Figure 1). That is, of course, absurd. There are many human rights that simply have no application to nonhumans. In the work that I have done on animal rights (Francione, 2000, 2008), I propose that a sensible and coherent theory of animal rights should focus on just one right for animals\u2014the right not to be treated as the property of humans. Let me explain why this makes sense. At present, animals are property; they are commodities that we own in the same way that we own automobiles or furniture. Like these inanimate forms of property, animals have only the value that we choose to give them. Any interest an animal has represents an economic cost that we as owners can choose to ignore (Figure 2). Animal property is, of course, different from the other things that we own in that animals, unlike cars, computers, machinery, or other commodities, are sentient and have interests (Figure 3). All sentient beings have interests in not suffering pain or other deprivations, and in satisfying those interests that are peculiar to their species. It costs money to protect animal interests. As a general matter, we spend money to protect animal interests only when it is justified as an economic matter\u2014only when we derive an economic benefit from doing so (Francione, 1995). The result is that animal welfare standards do little more than ensure that animals are exploited in an economically efficient way. For example, the Humane Slaughter Act in the United States, enacted originally in 1958, requires that larger animals slaughtered for food be stunned and not be conscious when they are shackled, hoisted, and taken to the killing floor. This law protects the interests that animals have at the moment of slaughter but does so only because it is economically beneficial for producers and consumers. The \u201c[f]indings and declarations of policy\u201d of the Act state: \u201cThe Congress finds that the use of humane methods in the slaughter of livestock prevents needless suffering; results in safer and better working conditions for persons engaged in the slaughtering industry; brings about improvement of products and economies in slaughtering operations; and produces other",

            "text": "Furthermore, obtaining meaningful informed consent from donors must ensure they retain some long-term control over their genetic material used to create organoids. Finally, we must ensure organoids derived from genetic minorities are used equitably and not in ways that perpetuate discrimination or stigma. Ethical issues surrounding brain organoid research include formal oversight, procurement of human biomaterials, translational delivery, animal research, and consciousness/moral status (Hyun et al., 2020). As organoids advance toward greater complexity, ethical concerns may arise about potential consciousness, though current evidence suggests this is unlikely (Farahany et al., 2018;Lavazza and Massimini, 2018). Concerns also exist around human-animal chimeras if organoids are engrafted in animals, based on effects on animal welfare and moral status (Munsie et al., 2017;Mansour et al., 2018). Robust informed consent is needed for biomaterials and data sharing as organoids are increasingly used for personalized medicine (Boers and Bredenoord, 2018;Boers et al., 2019a,b). Commercialization and equitable access are additional ethical considerations (Boers et al., 2019a,b). Open questions remain regarding if standard oversight mechanisms sufficiently cover brain organoids versus need for adapted guidelines and review processes (Cheshire, 2014). Overall, continued dialog among scientists, bioethicists, regulators, and publics can foster responsible innovation in this promising field. Lavazza (2021a,b) sees the ethical arguments related to brain organoid falling into the main themes of research oversight, consciousness, interaction with social environment, formal ethical oversight, and implantation in animals. This needs to be weighed against animal welfare and rights, and concerns related to the use of nonhuman primates they replace. A framework known as the Six Principles (6Ps) (Beauchamp and DeGrazia, 2020;DeGrazia and Beauchamp, 2021) aims to expand upon the 3Rs and be a practical means for assessing animal ethical issues like neural-chimeras and cerebral organoid xenotransplantation (Barnhart and Dierickx, 2023).",

The biological behavior of unknown, animalderived pathogens and the clinical manifestations of such infections cannot be predicted (Table 1). \n\nThe term \"xenosis\" (also \"direct zoonosis\" or \"xenozoonosis\") was coined to reflect the unique epidemiology of infection due to organisms carried by xenogeneic tissues.2.3,5,6 Xenotransplantation may pose a novel epidemiologic risk due to the potential transmission of pathogens, particularly viruses, with viable, cellular grafts. A number of factors may increase the risk of infection in xenotransplantation: \n\nThe xenograft serves as a permissive reservoir in which donor organisms bypass host defenses without a need for a \"vector\" to achieve disease transmission; Novel clinical syndromes may result from infection with animal-derived pathogens; Clinical laboratory assays for organisms from nonhuman species may not be available; Donor-derived organisms may not cause  Likely human pathogens derived from animals can be categorized according to the behavior of related organisms in allotransplant recipients (Table 2).

To reduce this risk as much as possible, a group of \"exclusion criteria\" (Table 3) can be generated for organisms likely to cause disease in xenograft recipients and lists of organisms created to guide the breeding of source animals for xenotransplantation (Table 4).

Other cases that can illustrate the ethical dilemmas within One Health are the sacrifice of healthy surplus farm animals [243] and euthanasia or the \"good death\" of animals at zoos [187,273]. These cases, as seen by several scholars, are complex and go beyond the traditional tension between the positions of \"welfarists\" and \"animal rights advocates\". \n\nTable 2 presents policy recommendations aimed at overcoming ethical dilemmas associated with animal culling during pandemics. The first recommendation emphasizes the need to develop alternatives to culling, such as vaccination or quarantine measures, to reduce the need for mass culling and minimize harm to animal populations. Strategies to prevent the immoral slaughter of minks and other animals, such as phasing out the fur industry or implementing vaccination programs, are not always well received by all audiences. Sometimes, the economic argument is prioritized: \"maintaining and investing in the well-being of farm animals can be very costly\" [274], but failing to act or acting reactively can lead to increased costs and heightened risks at the complex human-nonhumanenvironment interface [275]. The second recommendation focuses on strengthening ethical review processes to ensure that decisions involving animal culling are evaluated through a comprehensive lens of multispecies justice and ecological impacts. This recommendation is backed by several scholars who stress the need for ethical and critical contextualized scrutiny in One Health interventions and policies [172,173].

            "text": "Simple Summary Veterinary care of companion animals, particularly dogs and cats, continues to advance, with some companion animals receiving a standard of care equal to or exceeding that of human patients. While this has the potential to improve animal welfare and benefit other stakeholders, including animal owners and veterinary team members, it also poses ethical challenges. We discuss key ethical challenges associated with AVC, including its relationship to standards of veterinary care, its potential to perpetuate poor quality of life and suffering, cost and accessibility of veterinary care, conflicts of interest, and concerns about experimentation without appropriate ethical review. We conclude by suggesting some strategies for veterinary teams and other stakeholders, such as professional bodies and regulators, to address these concerns. Abstract Advanced veterinary care (AVC) of companion animals may yield improved clinical outcomes, improved animal welfare, improved satisfaction of veterinary clients, improved satisfaction of veterinary team members, and increased practice profitability. However, it also raises ethical challenges. Yet, what counts as AVC is difficult to pinpoint due to continuing advancements. We discuss some of the challenges in defining advanced veterinary care (AVC), particularly in relation to a standard of care (SOC). We then review key ethical challenges associated with AVC that have been identified in the veterinary ethics literature, including poor quality of life, dysthanasia and caregiver burden, financial cost and accessibility of veterinary care, conflicts of interest, and the absence of ethical review for some patients undergoing AVC. We suggest some strategies to address these concerns, including prospective ethical review utilising ethical frameworks and decision-making tools, the setting of humane end points, the role of regulatory bodies in limiting acceptable procedures, and the normalisation of quality-of-life scoring. We also suggest a role for retrospective ethical review in the form of ethics rounds and clinical auditing. Our discussion reenforces the need for a spectrum of veterinary care for companion animals.",

            "text": "Simple Summary In the EU, the breeding of genetically modified laboratory animals is defined as an animal experiment, if the animals may experience pain, suffering or harm due to the genetic modification. In most cases, modifications of the immune system do not lead to pain, suffering, or harm given the animals are kept under specific pathogen-free housing conditions. Nevertheless, the EU working group on genetically altered animals defined SPF housing conditions as \u201cRefinement\u201d. According to this working group, applied refinement strategies for breeding genetically modified animals do not exclude them from project licensing. Thus, theoretical suffering, pain or harm is assumed without applying methods of actual burden assessment. Furthermore, the definition of SPF as a refinement strategy rather than a standard husbandry procedure leads to incomprehension among the scientific community in the EU. Here, we discuss the ethical basis of animal experiments as well as the current legal situation for immunodeficient animals. Furthermore, we discuss potential pain, suffering, or harm of immunodeficient animals from an immunological perspective. Finally, we briefly outline an animal welfare-oriented approach to severity assessment of immunodeficient mice. Abstract In the EU, the breeding of genetically modified laboratory animals is, by definition, an animal experiment if the offspring may experience pain, suffering, or harm. In order to determine the actual burden of genetically modified mice, established methods are available. However, the breeding of immunodeficient mice is considered an experiment requiring a permit, even if no pain, suffering or harm is observed under scientifically required defined hygienic housing conditions, as determined by established methods of severity assessment. This seems contradictory and leads to uncertainty among scientists. With this commentary, we would like to shed light on this topic from different perspectives and propose a solution in terms of individualized severity assessment and approval procedures.",

            "text": "It has been more than a century since researchers began investigating the possibility of using animal tissues and organs in humans. Xenotransplantation has risen in popularity as a result of the success of allotransplantation [1], which is 'the transplantation of an organ or tissue from one individual to another of the same species with a different genotype' [2], as a treatment for a variety of illnesses, including organ failure. Xenotransplantation is 'the deliberate transfer of living cells, tissues, or organs from individuals of one species to individuals of another' [3]. It is believed that using pigs as a source of transplants will allow transplantation to have a significantly greater impact on medicine and public health than allotransplantation [4]. However, this has not yet been proven. It is generally agreed that the recipient's immunity, incompatibility of biologic systems, and transfer of new pathogenic organisms are all biologic obstacles to xenotransplantation that are currently impeding its use in clinical settings [4][5][6][7][8][9], in addition to the ethical concerns pertaining to xenotransplantation [4,10]. The genetic modification of animal sources could be a viable answer to the xenotransplantation problem [3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11]. The tools for genetically altering animals have progressed significantly over the past two decades [12]. The advancement of reversal xenografts, in which human stem cells are implanted into pigs under conditions that promote differentiation and enlargement into functioning tissues and maybe organs, has also been aided by the advancement of this novel type of xenograft [3]. It is necessary to evaluate the constraints of genetic engineering and to propose models for advancing xenotransplantation and reverse xenotransplantation clinical applications in order to build on these recent successes.",

The privacy of donors, particularly in the case of iPSCs where genetic information is involved, must be safeguarded. Policies and guidelines are needed to address these concerns adequately, ensuring that the rights and welfare of all stakeholders are respected [1,9]. Furthermore, the field of CTE must grapple with issues of justice and accessibility. As these technologies advance, it is imperative to consider how they can be made available equitably, avoiding disparities in access to cuttingedge medical treatments. This consideration is particularly important in the context of global healthcare, where resource disparities can exacerbate inequities. \n\nThe ethical and regulatory challenges in CTE are dynamic and multifaceted. They encompass not only the sourcing and use of cells, particularly hESCs but also the broader implications of rapidly evolving biotechnologies and the intricacies of diverse regulatory frameworks. Addressing these challenges requires a comprehensive approach, involving ethical scrutiny, regulatory vigilance, and a commitment to equity and justice.

In 2019 alone, only 19,454 (23.90%) of the 81,410 people waiting were able to receive organ transplants. There is an increasing focus from both the medical profession and society on how to fill the gap between supply and demand. Methods Xenotransplantation using animal organs is being considered as one option to make up for the shortage of human organs for transplantation. For some years now, the international medical community has been examining the possibility of using animal organs for human transplant. However, the research has faced two important types of challenges: scientific and ethical issues. Results In January 2021, the first clinical trial of transgenic pig heart transplantation into a human recipient was completed by the Medical Center of the University of Maryland in the United States. This has stimulated enthusiasm and interest in xenotransplantation. Conclusions The trend towards xenotransplantation has highlighted global problems such as the severe shortage of organ transplant donors and the high cost of organ transplantation. China needs to consider how to cope with the scientific, public health, and social ethics challenges of xenotransplantation clinical trials.",

            "text": "This would allow problems that are not recognized by this ethical outlook to persist or even worsen. The concept of a moral lock-in thus offers a theoretical account of how ethical problems can last or aggravate in the absence of a 'game changing' eventor indeed why the 'game' needs to change if such problems are to be addressed successfully. It can hence be important for an ethical discussion to consider whether genomic selection innovations might reflect and further entrench a locked-in ethical outlook. \n\nIf discussions on genomic selection should cover pre-existing ethical issues, as we have argued, the concepts of biopower and geneticization may become relevant. However, such discussions may also be based on other concepts. One could for example address how genomic selection might solve or aggravate animal welfare problems (Mark & Sand\u00f8e, 2010) or consider to what extent genomic selection innovations change the instrumentalization of breeding animals (cf. Turner, 2010). The concept of a moral lock-in offers a possible explanation for how ethical problems in breeding can persist or exacerbate under the influence of prevailing moral positions. \n\nBringing existing ethical issues into discussions of genomic breeding innovations does entail some dialectical challenges. In many discussion contexts, the claim that current (traditional or genomic) breeding approaches raise notable ethical problems may not garner widespread acceptance. Some interlocutors may insist that breeding approaches raise significant ethical problems only if breeding priorities are set inappropriately, for example when animal welfare is not given enough weight in selection decisions. A critique of breeding more broadly might also be rejected as unrealistic: ethical concerns that would call for major changes in (or even the abolition of) current breeding practices could according to this objection not expect to have much practical impact, given vested human interests in animal breeding. We cannot address these objections adequately here, but just note that different dialectical contexts may call for different types of discussion, some broader than others (see also the final section of this paper). It will be important to set the scope of discussion explicitly in any case.",

            "text": "Genetically modified pigs hold great promise in xenotransplantation. Therefore, genetically modified pigs can become cell, tissue and organ donors, providing a solution to severe shortage of organ donors. Advances in genetic engineering have made it possible to modify the xenograft donor genome in virtually unlimited ways. The challenge facing researchers is to develop the most effective combination of donor genome modifications to overcome the multilayered obstacles to xenotransplantation. The development of transplantation medicine would not have been possible without immunosuppressive drugs, which are also used in research on xenograft rejection inhibition. Some most commonly used substances include: mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, sirolimus, cyclosporin, belatacept, abatacept, fingolimod and everolimus [61,62]. Immunosuppressive drugs should be selective and administered in appropriate doses, so as to suppress the processes related to xenograft rejection on the one hand, while allowing normal immune responses to any infectious process in the recipient on the other. Table 1 summarizes the most important results and the longest survival times in organ pig-to-nonhuman primates models using genetically modified pigs and immunosuppressive drugs. \n\nThe concept of xenotransplantation is relatively old, but for many years, any effective applications remained beyond the realm of possibility. Limitations in both knowledge and technology were too great and multifaceted to render this idea true. Xenotransplantation is a multidisciplinary undertaking, requiring the development of a range of research methods. The range of specialties involved is broad, from molecular biology (developing the appropriate gene constructs, determining the characteristics of the transgenic animals produced), to animal breeding and experimental embryology (introducing gene constructs), pig farming (raising the pigs), immunology (ensuring donor and recipient histocompatibility), virology (detecting endogenous retroviruses), to transplant surgery. In recent years, advances have been made in all these areas, in terms of both knowledge and technology, bringing the successful application of xenotransplantation closer to reality.",

            "text": "the more the human element in such combinations increases, the more it is perceived as problematic: if a gene of human origin is introduced into an animal, it is not yet \"humanized\". thus, there are generally few misgivings in relation to the use of individual genes from the human organism in an animal or, conversely, the use of a therapeutically effective animal gene in the somatic genetic therapy of humans. the use of adult animal tissue in humans for therapeutic purposes, e.g. animal heart valves or the implantation of animal cells in cellular xenotransplantation, is also largely accepted. In general, it would appear that the integration of individual cells from a different species into the body of a human or an animal is accepted (microchimerism). this is not perceived as either the \"humanization\" of the animal in question or \"animalization\" of the human involved. Countless symbiotic alien organisms and even endoparasites reside permanently in every human being and animal. \n\nthe situation would appear to be different, however, when it comes to an elevated alien-species proportion, namely when structures, organ parts or organs are formed using human cells in an animal organism, when control is taken of the development of the host organism and when, in the case of transplantations into the brain, the characteristics of humans or another animal species arise in the animal. In the view of the NeK these concerns are based on the fact that the possible development by the chimera of a rudimentary form of the perception, sensibility, experience or consciousness of humans or another animal species cannot be excluded. According to the NeK, reservations in relation to the formation of organ parts or partial structures of humans in animals and in relation to interspecies chimeras in humans for research or therapeutic purposes are justified from a human ethical perspective (NeK, 2006). \n\nIn terms of animal ethics, the fundamental question arises as to whether the generation of chimeras or inter-species hybrids can be justified. The Ethics Committee for Animal Studies of the SAMS and SCNAt does not fundamentally question the generation of chimeras and hybrids in relation to the protection of the welfare and dignity of the animal, nevertheless it deems the observation of restrictive conditions as necessary for the generation of chimeras and hybrids.",

The issue of donor animals having rights is controversial. Animal rights activists consider pigs to be \"complex, intellectual beings,\" who believe pigs should not be slain for human organs although they have been utilized as a source of meat for generations [41]. Like other nonhuman primates, baboons exhibit sophisticated social behaviors, and their usage raises several ethical considerations. Pigs, on the other hand, are significantly less contentious.

Though the Working Partying acknowledged that xenotransplantation was highly contested, it concluded that 'there are no significant in-principle ethical objections to the use of live organs and tissues from animals for human therapies, that would preclude any further research to develop such therapies' (emphasis in the original) (XWP 2003a, para 12.8). It reiterated a position it adopted in the previous consultation. That is, xenotransplantation clinical trials should be allowed to proceed 'if there are clear potential benefits, both for individual patients and for the general public' (XWP 2003a, para 12.15). The draft guidelines were revised to incorporate two new topics: animal welfare and patient selection. The additional guidelines required research protocols to specify clear information on the criteria for patient selection (proposed Guideline 4) (XWP 2003a, 158). Further, in accordance with the relevant regulations, all pre-clinical and clinical xenotransplantation studies are required to meet rigorous animal welfare standards (proposed Guideline 1) (XWP 2003a, 158).\n\nSimilarly to the initial consultation, the second round of consultation involved public meetings and a call for written submissions. In February 2004, the XWP held public meetings in all capital cities around the country attracting a total of 377 attendees. On this occasion, there were no targeted meetings. After the second round of meetings, Jack Sparrow, the second Chairperson of the XWP, made general comments on public responses in an interview on national radio. Sparrow reported that transplant recipients and patients on waiting lists, and their families supported xenotransplantation (Beaumont and Noble 2004, 3). However, he also added that ' Australians are more fearful about the use of living animal material in humans than they were 18 months ago as a result of the severe acute respiratory syndrome and bird flu outbreaks overseas' (Reuters News 2004). The Working Party received a total of 343 written submissions from respondents in Australia and overseas (XWP 2004, 4). From its public consultation, the XWP found that 'animal-to-human transplantation, in particular animal organ transplantation, is not",

            "text": "Although the prospective benefits are unquestionable, the use of xenogeneic products in human health care raises a number of issues; hence it has to be controlled strictly by the regulatory bodies to avoid complications. The duty of regulatory bodies is to regulate the indiscriminate use of animal-sourced material intended for human health application. The challenges include (1) the potential risk of transmission of infectious agents from source animals, (2) informed consent related issues, and (3) animal welfare issues [113]. \n\nFrom the preclinical testing, the regulations are made strict for the human welfare before use in clinical trials. In general, enough studies have to be performed for safety characterization of therapeutic agents including the efficacy or the activity and the toxicity or undesired effects to the host system. This type of potential clinical risks constitutes an important component of an FDA regulation. Transfer of animal microorganisms to the recipient with the graft during xenograft transplantation is another major concern for regulatory authorities [114]. There are reports that HIV, hepatitis B and C, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and rabies can be transmitted between humans during transplantation. It is also proved that contact between animals and humans during animal husbandry and from pets or food products can lead to zoonotic infections. So, the use of animal cells, tissues, and organs in any forms keeps the public health at risk with known and unknown infections. Hence it is advised to go for thorough screening for all kind of possible zoonotic infections by following the standard protocol [113]. Moreover, the risk of these microorganisms or virus getting adapted to human-to-human transmission is also a major factor that has to be considered, which might be a concern for general population [115]. When it comes to cross-species whole organ transplantation, there is unavoidable transfer of endogenous retrovirus that is existing in the genome of all porcine cells into the patient receiving the organ. However, there exists no documentation regarding the transfer of these viruses in humans who are exposed to pig organs [116], probably due to the lack of long-term observation. \n\nPreclinical studies provide valuable insight into the safety issues before being used in the human volunteers.",

First, animals are used for a variety of purposes to benefit humanity in Christian Scripture, including sacrifice in the Old Testament, food, clothing, and agricultural purposes. Protestants would affirm that the privilege of dominion over the created world is always balanced in Scripture by the responsibility to be a good steward over that which has been entrusted to humanity. Generally, theologically conservative Protestants view the responsible use of animals for human advancement and flourishing as permissible. \n\nSecond, a central ethical issue in xenotransplantation is the risk of xenozoonotic infection to xenograft recipients, close contacts, and public health. The risk may conflict with the Christian duty to steward the body well (1 Corinthians 6:19-20) and love one's neighbor (Matthew 22:39). That is, what does it mean to \"love my neighbor as myself\" if a procedure for my benefit could also cause harm (possible xenozoonosis) to my neighbor? It could be reasonably argued that loving a neighbor would certainly include supporting xenotransplantation research as it provides the opportunity to express compassion for the needs of others and the alleviation of suffering (similar to allotransplantation). Yet, on the other hand, Christians should not be concerned with the welfare of the individual to the detriment of the community (Jeremiah 29:7). While xenotransplantation may lead to greater human flourishing, it could also (albeit, unlikely) prove disastrous for humanity and produce the opposite effect of flourishing. Without significant safety assurances, pursuing xenotransplantation might not align with loving one's neighbor.",

            "text": "Replacement of dysfunctional organs through transplantation is an attractive approach for the treatment of organ failure. However, the imbalance between supply and demand for replaceable human organs is a major problem for clinical transplantation. Although xenotransplantation may be an alternative option for this huge bottleneck, it is not a newly developed concept. The xenotransfusion of blood from lambs to humans in 1667 was first mentioned xenotransplantation in the context [1]. Clinical use of animal-originated organs has also been reported, that is, rabbit kidney transplantation to a human in 1905. Many kinds of animals are used for transplantation research, and this usage revealed the advantage and disadvantages of used animal models. Because of their closer phylogenetical relationship with humans, several trials involving the kidneys, hearts, and livers of nonhuman primates (NHPs) were conducted from the 1920s to 1990s [2,3]. Disadvantages of NHPs as animal models arise with continuous research, such as limited supplies due to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), xenotransmission to humans, need for isolated facility and experts for the breeding [4]. Researchers have attempted to use pigs as the source animal for xenotransplantation since the 1990s, and the pig is currently considered the most appropriate candidate species. The pig's relatively short maturation period, its size and physiological similarity to humans, the lowrisk of xenozoonosis, and the application of genetic engineering techniques to produce porcine organs that are resistant to immunological rejection are the reasons for selecting the pig as a source animal [5]. The aforementioned advantages of pigs and NHPs revealed the necessity of the development of various genetically modified immunodeficient large animal models for preclinical xenotransplantation research, including severe combined immunodeficient (SCID), and resulted in considerable improvement of xenografts. \n\nIn addition to xenotransplantation, the value of the immunodeficient model has become increasingly important due to the emergence of regenerative medicine, including stem cell research.",

            "text": "The ethical matrix includes four ethical principles. The principle of nonmaleficence or non-malfeasance is essentially the norm to avoid causing harm to morally considerable entities, and the principle of beneficence the norm to act in such entities' benefit (Beauchamp & Childress, 1979). The principle of respect for autonomy, furthermore, requires respect for the self-determination of autonomous beings and justice requires fairness in the distribution of benefits as well as risks and costs (ibid.). These are mainstream ethical principles in applied ethics that capture our obligations not only towards other humans but supposedly also, with some modifications, our obligations to nonhuman animals and 7 Page 6 of 18 the environment (Mepham, 2000). These principles should be relatively easy to appreciate for non-ethicists, which should support ethical deliberation across disciplinary boundaries (ibid.). Coles et al. (2015) also recognize two ethical concepts that do not fit the ethical matrix' four principles, however. The first of these relates to the 'naturalness' or 'unnaturalness' of animals bred with genetic modification or genomic selection, the second concerns the ethical permissibility of 'disenhancing' animals by reducing their capacity for suffering under prevailing farming conditions. Based on these principles and concepts, the authors conclude that there is a stronger ethical case for genomic selection than for genetic modification, under some provisos. These provisos are that the general public does not perceive genomic selection as strongly unnatural, that adverse animal welfare effects are prevented, and that positive outcomes of genomic breeding are promoted. \n\nRemarkably different ethical perspectives on genomic selection are offered by Twine ( 2010) and Holloway and colleagues (e.g., Holloway & Morris, 2008, 2012;Holloway et al., 2011), whose analyses draw mainly on the notions of 'biopower' and 'geneticization'. \n\nThe concept of biopower was introduced by Foucault (2018Foucault ( [1976]]) to characterize how human bodies and populations are being optimized according to the needs of capitalism and the modern state. According to Twine (2010) and Holloway and colleagues, this concept can be extended to characterize contemporary relationships between humans and farmed animals and, derivatively, between humans involved in breeding.",

            "text": "However, for the purpose of this essay, we will discuss informed consent as it is generally understood. Headway into the development of informed consent forms has been made, one example being the draft consent form created by USA's Secretary's Advisory Committee on Xenotransplantation [41,42]. Informed consent forms have also been proposed by the International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR) and adopted in various countries such as Germany and Taiwan [43]. Being thoroughly informed throughout the consenting process is a key ethical consideration -further endeavours should delve into clarifying the consenting process and ensuring that organ recipients are told exactly what is being done to their body and enable them to understand reasonably foreseen issues. This is especially true in the unique context of xenotransplantation which has an obvious risk-benefit divergence -is this procedure likely to prolong and ensure good quality of life [44]? It is currently unclear if the risks of developing novel zoonotic infections far outweigh the potential benefits [45], and from an animal rights and welfare perspective, the humanity of such novel technologies is still not well established [46]. The recipient is mandated to participate in lifelong follow-up to detect potential transmission of infections to humans, a form of Ulysses contract. Withdrawal from the follow-up based on personal autonomy must be balanced against risk of infection transmission [47]. In the interest of public health, lifelong surveillance of the individual is required to assess and control a possible spread of zoonotic and infectious diseases [48]. Such doctrines may be difficult to enforce due to potential compromise to patient autonomy. The double standards in human behavior were clearly visible during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, as many people expected others to follow quarantine rules while believing they deserved exemptions from those same rules [39]. As a result, enforcing these regulations created ethical challenges for healthcare providers, who had to spend extra time navigating legal discussions to find solutions.",

            "text": "The unknown potential to transmit known and unknown diseases from the pig organ to human recipient [16,17] elevates the risk profile of first-in-human pig kidney xenotransplant trials. \n\nThe five xenotransplants (2 heart, 3 kidney) performed under the FDA's Expanded Access program [14,[18][19][20] provide some information about how xenotransplants functioned in those recipients (e.g., the fact that grafts survived 2 months). However, the different eligibility criteria, different gene-edited pigs used, and patients' grave conditions mean that their outcomes are unlikely to be commensurate with clinical trial outcomes. Accordingly, the information disclosed to prospective trial participants about such xenotransplants must be qualified. \n\nMagnifying these challenges is that few, if any, treatment alternatives for patients with end-stage kidney disease exist, which can render patients vulnerable and undermine voluntary decision-making [12,13]. Such vulnerability commonly occurs among patients undergoing innovative surgical procedures for which alternative standard treatments are either ineffective or nonexistent [21]. In regard to first-inhuman xenotransplant trials, waitlisted candidates may have exhausted all life-saving options, as in the Expanded Access xenotransplants. \n\nThe ethical challenges to informed consent comprise a component of translational research that requires resolution. Current federal regulations (i.e., the National Organ Transplant Act of 1984) lack guidance on informed consent for xenotransplant clinical trials [22]. Organ Procurement and Transplant Network policies only pertain to human organs. Thus, policies on information disclosure may not translate to the xenotransplant context. \n\nFew scholars have made headway in addressing this problem. Padilla and colleagues reviewed The US Department of Health and Human Services nine minimum elements that consent forms must include to protect human subjects, highlighting how these elements should be conveyed in the consent process and in the informed consent form for xenotransplantation [23]. Drawing upon this work, Cooper prepared an informed consent form template tailored to the xenotransplant trial context [24].",

            "text": "Simple Summary Innovation and research to advance animal welfare, particularly that of companion animal species, can present unique ethical challenges, and there are presently gaps in support and independent oversight structures for ethical decision-making. This commentary details key gaps and one organization\u2019s creation of an Ethical Review Board and structure for ethical review to help address them. Abstract To date, independent ethical oversight of many companion animal welfare initiatives has been limited and, in some instances, inadequate. Beyond a blurred line between \u201cinnovation\u201d and \u201cresearch,\u201d the nature of the work conducted in animal welfare projects is often poorly aligned with established institutional ethical review structures, which are designed for research involving humans or research involving animals and are also focused on industry and academic institutions. This commentary details the struggle of one United States-based nonprofit organization to find ethical guidelines and support for conducting non-traditional field-based animal welfare studies, and subsequent experience establishing an Ethical Review Board to evaluate organizational initiatives. The commentary discusses member selection, materials and processes, and lessons and learnings from the creation and use of an Ethical Review Board. Sharing content of the ethical review process, as well as challenges and learnings from it, is intended to support other organizations and individuals seeking to ensure that innovation for animal welfare consistently meets high ethical standards.",

            "text": "The successful cloning of rhesus monkeys poses several issues for further investigation, in addition to opening new directions in behavioural and biological research. 1Cloned monkeys have the potential to significantly advance our understanding of complicated diseases in biomedical research, especially those with a large genetic component.These primates facilitate the development and testing of targeted medicines because they can reproduce specific human genetic abnormalities.Genetically identical monkeys can offer special insights into the genetic foundations of behaviour and cognition in behavioural studies. 13However, this field still has many obstacles to overcome.The effectiveness of this cloning procedure is a primary concern.Currently, primate cloning has a low success rate and requires the generation of several embryos to produce viable offspring.\n\nTo improve cloning viability from ethical and practical standpoints, it must have increased efficiency and reliability.The guiding concepts of ethical guidelines for animal research usually include minimising harm, guaranteeing animal care and performing studies only when absolutely necessary. 14Institutional review boards and other regulatory agencies that monitor the care of animals in research settings are frequently involved in upholding these guidelines.However, in the case of cloned animals, current regulations may be insufficient to cover certain ethical issues. 15Concerns over genetic diversity, animal welfare and other unforeseen consequences arise with cloning.Previous cloning experiences, especially with well-known cases such as Dolly the sheep, have led to the development of regulatory solutions that guarantee the moral treatment of cloned animals. 16Moving forward, governing bodies should consider updating existing guidelines to specifically address ethical challenges posed by cloning, including issues related to animal welfare, genetic modification and long-term health implications.\n\nProviding the public with clear and accessible information on the pros and cons of cloning, including its potential benefits for scientific research and agriculture and its ethical and welfare concerns, is essential for informed decision-making and public engagement. 17",

            "text": "What really matters is to review the various positions between these two poles, since the growing debate over the last twenty years has shown that simplistic, extreme stances are untenable. \n\nIn order to clarify what we mean by 'the untenability of simplistic, extreme stances', we could say the following: 1) for those who view animal experimentation as an inalienable right of the human species, this right corresponds increasingly to certain concomitant rights for animals, since 'cruelty' should always be combated, given that it is kind of behavior pertaining to the sphere of morality and 2) based on evidence from the scientific domain itself, animal well-being has a positive influence on the results of experiments. On the other hand, opponents of animal experimentation are urged by the current debate to address the following question: what animals are we talking about? From microorganisms to us, human animals, where does one make the cutoff point for equal moral consideration? Should only the use of primates cease immediately, as some demand? In the ethical domain, the concept of sentient beings is important, while in the scientific terrain the search for differences and similarities between humans and animals is as old as it is surprising, which explains why we can increasingly affirm that we are \"merely one more single species\", since oneness is a characteristic of all species (Foley, 1993:20). \n\nThis article aims to review various positions, concepts, and arguments in the debate, besides providing brief background on the use of animals in experiments, a fundamental theme for demonstrating how the borders of the area of moral concern have expanded for various reasons, while seeking to encompass other species besides humans. In order to understand this expansion it is important to observe the contributions by scientific progress to the current state of events, particularly those mobilized for this debate, i.e., allowing for the incorporation of the 'animal welfare' concept into theory and practice. Furthermore, scientific progress itself has increased our difficulty in clearly delineating between humans and animals, thereby further fueling the 'animal rights' issue.",

Genetic engineering raises concerns about unforeseen ecological consequences and the risks associated with gene editing techniques like CRISPR-Cas9. When evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of recombinant fibrous proteins, animal models are necessarily needed. However, the use of animal models necessitates careful attention to animal welfare and the exploration of alternative testing methods. Additionally, rigorous safety testing is essential to address potential health risks to humans, while environmental assessments are crucial to prevent accidental release and ecological disruption. The commercialization of these therapies also presents ethical challenges, including ensuring equitable access to treatments and addressing the implications of intellectual property rights on innovation and accessibility. Engaging stakeholders, including patients, policymakers, and the public, in ethical discussions is essential. Establishing clear ethical guidelines, ensuring informed consent, and promoting responsible stewardship of biological resources are crucial for navigating these complex ethical considerations.",

Since the 1990s, researchers have attempted to use pigs as the source animal for xenotransplantation, and the pig is currently considered the most appropriate candidate species. Reasons for selecting the pig as a source animal include the pig's relatively large litter size and short maturation period, its size and physiological similarity to humans, the low risk of xenozoonosis, and the readily application of genetic engineering techniques to produce porcine organs that are resistant to rejection (7). However, the genetic discrepancy between pigs and humans has resulted in barriers for xenotransplantation, including immunological rejection, and risk of xenozoonosis. As with human allotransplants, xenotransplants are prone to immunological rejection. However, a vascularized porcine organ is more vigorously rejected in comparison with the current reaction observed in allotransplants because of the genetic distance between pigs and primates. Thanks to genetically modified pigs and immunosuppressive therapy, survival time results for xenografts have improved considerably in preclinical xenotransplantation models. These results in NHP models indicate that the use of xenotransplantation in clinical applications is approaching.\n\nIn this article, we (a) describe our understanding of immunological rejection responses in xenotransplantation, (b) summarize the genetically modified pigs used for xenotransplantation, and (c) report the current survival time of xenografts in pig-to-NHP models. On the basis of this considerable progress, we hold that clinical application of xenotransplantation will soon be a reality.",

            "text": "This extraordinary progress has led some to speculate that xenotransplantation will ultimately be accomplished through ever increasing genetic modification. This may be part of the answer, but there are three key issues with this approach. First, the xenotransplant community remains divided over exactly which genetic modifications are necessary. While some modifications, including GalTKO, are well-studied, others are supported only by mouse models or by a small number of cases in NHP models. Cost is a major obstacle to definitive research here, as genetically modified animals are expensive to produce, and transplants in NHPs are expensive to conduct. However, these modifications may have unintended consequences (e.g. creation of neoepitopes, seen in transplant of CMAH KO pigs to old world monkeys) (58), and it is important that each individual modification is subject to rigorous scrutiny. \n\nSecond, while genes may be reliably incorporated within the genome using new gene editing technologies, uneven gene expression in transgenic animals remains an issue. Of particular concern is tissue-specific gene expression. For example, transgenes that are only expressed in the liver will not be effective in kidney xenotransplantation. On a more granular level, studies have shown that human CD47 expression in pig endothelial cells and podocytes prevented phagocytosis by correcting CD47-SIRPa species incompatibilities and enabling normal SIRPa signal transduction. Indeed, hCD47 expression on podocytes in hCD47/GalTKO pig-tobaboon kidney transplants was shown to inhibit the development of proteinuria (59).. However, our data also demonstrated that high hCD47 expression in renal tubular cells may lead to destructive inflammatory responses via the hCD47-TSP-1 pathway (59). More research is needed to further refine and reliably predict gene expression in multiply modified pigs. \n\nThird, while genetic modifications may help protect pig xenografts from innate responses, genetic engineering alone is not sufficient to prevent rejection long-term, given the overwhelming number of possible xenoantigens that could trigger adaptive responses and antibody-mediated rejection.",

Therefore, alternatives to the use of human organs for transplantation, continue to be explored including use of stem cells, artificial organs, and organs from other species (xenotransplantation). In xenotransplantation, the species of choice remains the pig due to its physiological similarities to humans, reduced costs, ease of manipulation, and reduced ethical concerns to its use. However, in order to develop pig organs that are suitable for xenotransplantation, complex genetic modification need to be undertaken. These modifications require the introduction of precise genetic changes into the pig that can only be accomplished at this time using somatic cell nuclear transfer. We cover in this review advances in transgenic manipulation and cloning in swine and how the development of these two technologies is critical to the eventual utilization of the pig as a human organ donor.",

            "text": "If scientists can substitute the use of 10 genome-edited monkeys for the use of 1000 genome-edited mice in a search for a treatment for a devastating neurological disorder, should they do so? What if the use of monkeys offers a more promising route to such a discovery? Questions about the tradeoffs in using different types of animals as models for human disease raise important issues of relative animal moral status, comparative welfare, and the virtues of science. Yet decisions about what animal models to use in biomedicine are under-examined in the animal ethics literature, which tends to focus instead on whether and when animal research is justified. At the same time, while animal researchers are careful in selecting scientifically appropriate animal models, the ethical nuances of such tradeoffs are also left relatively unexamined by the regulatory and professional norms that guide their work. In this paper, we interrogate the ethical dimensions of potential tradeoffs between animal models of human disease, focusing, in particular, on a likely trend toward greater use of genome-edited large mammals, which could portend an eventual shift away from less successful rodent models of disease. \n\nTo examine ethical questions around such a tradeoff in the use of animals in research, we turn first to the standard (or \"orthodox\") approaches, which include, on one hand, ethics oversight within biomedical research communities, and, on the other hand, critical theoretical reflections on animal research, including rights-based and utilitarian approaches. While each of these perspectives has something important to offer in considering whether and when to make tradeoffs between animal models, we identify a lacuna left open by the standard dialectic involving the mentioned approaches. Specifically, oversight of biomedical research offers guidance on the profession's permitted uses of animals within a research setting and orthodox approaches to animal ethics questions when and whether animals should be used in biomedicine; however, neither approach investigates sufficiently the nuances of ethical practices within the research setting. To fill this lacuna, we consider how a virtue ethical approach to the use of specific animal models in biomedicine could add to the ethical dialogue. Before we approach these issues, we need to say more about why a shift to increased uses of larger mammals may be on the horizon for biomedicine.",

            "text": "Xenotransplantation is emerging as a vital solution to the critical shortage of organs available for transplantation, significantly propelled by advancements in genetic engineering and the development of sophisticated immunosuppressive treatments. Specifically, the transplantation of kidneys from genetically engineered pigs into human patients has made significant progress, offering a potential clinical solution to the shortage of human kidney supply. Recent trials involving the transplantation of these modified porcine kidneys into deceased human bodies have underscored the practicality of this approach, advancing the field towards potential clinical applications. However, numerous challenges remain, especially in the domains of identifying suitable donor-recipient matches and formulating effective immunosuppressive protocols crucial for transplant success. Critical to advancing xenotransplantation into clinical settings are the nuanced considerations of anesthesia and surgical practices required for these complex procedures. The precise genetic modification of porcine kidneys marks a significant leap in addressing the biological and immunological hurdles that have traditionally challenged xenotransplantation. Yet, the success of these transplants hinges on the process of meticulously matching these organs with human recipients, which demands thorough understanding of immunological compatibility, the risk of organ rejection, and the prevention of zoonotic disease transmission. In parallel, the development and optimization of immunosuppressive protocols are imperative to mitigate rejection risks while minimizing side effects, necessitating innovative approaches in both pharmacology and clinical practices. Furthermore, the post-operative care of recipients, encompassing vigilant monitoring for signs of organ rejection, infectious disease surveillance, and psychological support, is crucial for ensuring post-transplant life quality. This comprehensive care highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary approach involving transplant surgeons, anesthesiologists, immunologists, infectiologists and psychiatrists. The integration of anesthesia and surgical expertise is particularly vital, ensuring the best possible outcomes of those patients undergoing these novel transplants, through safe procedural practices. As xenotransplantation moving closer to clinical reality, establishing consensus guidelines on various aspects, including donor-recipient selection, immunosuppression, as well as surgical and anesthetic management of these transplants, is essential. Addressing these challenges through rigorous research and collective collaboration will be the key, not only to",

Nascent first-in-human xenotransplantation research trials present unique ethical challenges which may translate into obligations for researchers and special considerations for institutional review boards (IRBs). Contextual vulnerability is an important consideration in reviewing proposed subject selection methods. Some recipients are uniquely prone to receiving an unfair offer to enroll in an experimental clinical trial when excluded from allograft waitlists due to psychosocial or compliance evaluations. These exclusions represent an allocational injustice. Enrolling research subjects subjectively excluded from allotransplantation into xenotransplant research is not a mechanism of fair access but rather an exploitation of an unjustly option-constrained vulnerable group by the clinical transplant system. Carefully considering contextual vulnerability can help researchers and IRBs clarify eligibility criteria for xenograft clinical trials. A requirement for simultaneous allograft co-listing can safeguard the interests of vulnerable potential subjects.\nINTRODUCTION\nIn the United States, the supply of allogeneic, or human-derived, organs and tissues from living donors and cadavers available for transplant into critically ill individuals is inadequate.[i] Physicians refer only half of potentially eligible patients for transplant evaluation, and the clinical transplant team ultimately waitlists less than 30 percent.[ii] Waitlists are lengthy for those who make it through the evaluation process, and many individuals die while waiting for a transplant.[iii]\nIn contrast to allogeneic transplants, xenotransplantation, from the prefix, xeno- meaning foreign, is the process of taking live organs or tissues from an animal for surgical placement into a human recipient. Xenografts are typically sourced from porcine animals (domestic pigs) or non-human primates (baboons) and range from simple tissues like corneas to complex vital organs like hearts, lungs, or kidneys. Scientists have explored xenotransplantation methods for decades, but research with vital organ xenotransplants has been in largely haphazard and non-controlled studies, which demonstrated only short-duration survival for recipients.[iv] Recent advances using gene modification and improved immunosuppression in single-patient attempts to transplant porcine organs into brain-dead human recipients have presented more realistic human-environment models; however, these modified xenografts have still functioned only for very short durations.[v]\nThe limited bioethics discourse on xenotransplantation centers primarily on the ethical use of high-order animals and the risks of zoonotic infectious disease spread.[vi] Bioethics pays insufficient attention to the potential for exploitation of vulnerable individuals in need of a transplant amid growing interest in phase I clinical trials in living human subjects. Clinician-investigators in contemporary literature repeatedly recommend that these trials enroll subjects who are medically eligible for, but effectively excluded or outright denied access to, an allograft.[vii] The Food & Drug Administration (FDA) recommends xenotransplants be limited to subjects with serious or life-threatening diseases for whom adequately safe and effective alternative therapies are not available.[viii] The ethically salient difference between the investigator and the regulatory recommendations is why alternatives are not available to potential subjects: because transplant centers have subjectively denied access or because there is a clinical contraindication that proves prohibitively risky.\u00a0 In a notable single-patient emergency use authorization, physician-investigators offered a genetically modified porcine heart to a living male recipient after denying him access to the waitlist for a human-donor heart, citing a history of non-compliance.[ix] \u00a0This case suggests that a person denied access to a transplant waitlist due to subjective compliance criteria is an appropriate research subject. The physician-investigators failed to acknowledge how offering a xenotransplant to a contextually vulnerable subject is potentially unfair. Contextual vulnerability is a specific feature of a research environment that increases a subject\u2019s risk of harm. Bioethics discourse must address this vulnerability within the transplant research environment.\nThis paper describes the current transplant system\u2019s use of subjective evaluation criteria, particularly psychosocial support and compliance. Subjective evaluation criteria perpetuate discriminatory medical biases rather than advance the transplant system\u2019s goal of additional life-years gained. Researchers designing controlled human subject trials and institutional review boards (IRBs) reviewing and approving proposed protocols must consider how disparate waitlisting practices unjustly preclude some patients from a fair opportunity to access an allograft and impacts their participation in research. It is unethical for physician-investigators to intentionally take advantage of this vulnerability, creating an exploitative and unethical transaction.[x] Protocol inclusion criteria requiring proof of simultaneous allograft listing is a feasible procedural safeguard to protect research subjects\u2019 interests.\nI.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Injustices in Organ Allocation\nSolid organ allocation systems are varied but aim for equity and efficiency in granting individuals with similar claims a fair opportunity to access the scarce resource. Allocation decisions attempt to maximize the common good of additional life-years gained.[xi] The federal oversight of allograft allocation in the US uses objective clinical metrics like blood type, immune compatibility, body size, and geographic distance to match organs to recipients to increase both graft and patient survival.[xii] Transplant centers additionally use their own evaluations to waitlist patients. Although variation exists between transplant center criteria across more objective measurements, such as lab values and concurrent diseases, significant inconsistencies arise in how they incorporate subjective factors like compliance with medical recommendations, psychosocial support, and intellectual disability into the review process.[xiii] Only 7 percent of renal transplant programs use formal criteria for subjective psychosocial assessments, while no pediatric solid organ transplant programs use formal, explicit, or uniform review to assess developmental delays and psychosocial support.[xiv] Failing to establish uniform definitions and inconsistently applying evaluation criteria in the review of potential transplant candidates introduce bias into listing practices.[xv] The center they present to and the variable evaluative criteria the center uses may discount an individual\u2019s claim to a fair opportunity to access a scarce resource.\nLabeling a patient non-compliant can preclude both a referral to and placement on a waitlist for potentially suitable recipients. Compliance considerations presuppose that graft longevity will be jeopardized by an individual\u2019s failure to adhere to pre- and post-transplant regimens. It is necessary to distinguish individuals who are intentionally non-adherent to treatment regimens and demonstrate willful disregard for medical recommendations from those who are involuntarily non-adherent due to barriers that limit full participation in care plans. The former would not be offered a spot on the waitlist for an allograft, nor would investigators offer them a spot in a xenotransplantation research study. Significant and repeated refusals to participate in treatment plans would confound the ability of researchers to collect necessary data and perform the safety monitoring required by early-phase clinical trials. Enrolling subjects who are medically eligible for a traditional transplant but denied access requires a population that is suitably compliant to participate in a clinical trial reliably and safely yet judged not worthy of receipt of a standard allograft during the evaluation process.\u00a0\nThe latter population is most disadvantaged by compliance judgments and unsubstantiated outcome predictions. Multi-center research studies have found that moderate non-adherence to immunosuppression regimens is not directly associated with poor kidney transplant outcomes.[xvi] Nor are intellectual and developmental disabilities, conditions for which transplant centers may categorically refuse evaluation, clear indicators of an individual\u2019s ability to comply with treatment regimens.[xvii] Large cohort studies of both pediatric kidney and liver transplant recipients found no correlation between intellectual disability and graft or patient survival.[xviii] Rather, it is the perpetuation of medical biases and quality-of-life judgments that presumptively label specific populations poor transplant candidates or label their support systems insufficient, notwithstanding data demonstrating their ability to achieve successful transplant outcomes.[xix]\nVariability in compliance assessments and psychosocial support criteria allows medical biases to persist and disproportionately impedes waitlist access to patients from underserved populations.[xx] Low-income Medicaid patients are 2.6 times more likely to be labelled non-compliant as privately insured patients.[xxi] Additionally, the medical records of Black patients are 2.5 times more likely to contain negative descriptors like non-compliant, non-adherent, aggressive, unpleasant, and hysterical than those of white patients.[xxii] The higher prevalence of stigmatizing, compliance-based language in the medical records of minority, economically disadvantaged, and disabled persons decreases the likelihood that they will be recommended for a transplant, referred for an evaluation, placed on a wait",

Multi-center research studies have found that moderate non-adherence to immunosuppression regimens is not directly associated with poor kidney transplant outcomes.[xvi] Nor are intellectual and developmental disabilities, conditions for which transplant centers may categorically refuse evaluation, clear indicators of an individual\u2019s ability to comply with treatment regimens.[xvii] Large cohort studies of both pediatric kidney and liver transplant recipients found no correlation between intellectual disability and graft or patient survival.[xviii] Rather, it is the perpetuation of medical biases and quality-of-life judgments that presumptively label specific populations poor transplant candidates or label their support systems insufficient, notwithstanding data demonstrating their ability to achieve successful transplant outcomes.[xix]\nVariability in compliance assessments and psychosocial support criteria allows medical biases to persist and disproportionately impedes waitlist access to patients from underserved populations.[xx] Low-income Medicaid patients are 2.6 times more likely to be labelled non-compliant as privately insured patients.[xxi] Additionally, the medical records of Black patients are 2.5 times more likely to contain negative descriptors like non-compliant, non-adherent, aggressive, unpleasant, and hysterical than those of white patients.[xxii] The higher prevalence of stigmatizing, compliance-based language in the medical records of minority, economically disadvantaged, and disabled persons decreases the likelihood that they will be recommended for a transplant, referred for an evaluation, placed on a wait",

Recent findings Developments within xenotransplantation may soon allow for pig-to-human xenotransplantation to take place. Ethical analysis of xenotransplantation commonly follows an anthropocentric cost\u2013benefit analysis, which may imprecisely measure costs. Xenotransplantation should not merely be approached from an anthropocentric perspective. Rather, the potential risks presented to human and nonhuman donors, recipients, and third parties should all be thoroughly considered. Summary The range of feasible alternatives to xenotransplantation to increase organ supply should be examined before resorting to xenotransplantation because of the moral distinction between imposing certain risks on others before, or after, alternative solutions have been exhausted."

Porcine heart xenotransplantation could serve as an alternative source of organs for patients with terminal heart failure. A first\u2010in\u2010human porcine xenotransplantation that occurred in January 2022 at the University of Maryland Medical Center provided an opportunity to examine several ethical issues to guide selection criteria for future xenotransplantation clinical trials. In this article, the authors, who are clinicians at UMMC, discuss the appropriate balancing of risks and benefits and the significance, if any, of clinical equipoise. The authors also review the alleged role of the psychosocial evaluation in identifying patients at an elevated risk of posttransplant noncompliance, and they consider how the evaluation's implementation might enhance inequities among diverse populations. The authors argue that, based on the principle of reciprocity, psychosocial criteria should be used, not to exclude patients, but instead to identify patients who need additional support. Finally, the authors discuss the requirements for and the proper assessment of informed and voluntary consent from patients being considered for xenotransplantation."

Recent findings Developments within xenotransplantation may soon allow for pig-to-human xenotransplantation to take place. Ethical analysis of xenotransplantation commonly follows an anthropocentric cost\u2013benefit analysis, which may imprecisely measure costs. Xenotransplantation should not merely be approached from an anthropocentric perspective. Rather, the potential risks presented to human and nonhuman donors, recipients, and third parties should all be thoroughly considered. Summary The range of feasible alternatives to xenotransplantation to increase organ supply should be examined before resorting to xenotransplantation because of the moral distinction between imposing certain risks on others before, or after, alternative solutions have been exhausted."

The conception of animal welfare used by scientists must relate closely to these ethical concerns if the orientation of the research and the interpretation of the findings is to address them successfully.At least three overlapping ethical concerns are commonly expressed regarding the quality of life of animals: (1) that animals should lead natural lives through the development and use of their natural adaptations and capabilities, (2) that animals should feel well by being free from prolonged and intense fear, pain, and other negative states, and by experiencing normal pleasures, and (3) that animals should function well, in the sense of satisfactory health, growth and normal functioning of physiological and behavioural systems. Various scientists have proposed restricted conceptions of animal welfare that relate to only one or other of these three concerns. Some such conceptions are based on value positions about what is truly important for the quality of life of animals or about the nature of human responsibility for animals in their care. Others are operational claims: (1) that animal welfare research must focus on the functioning of animals because subjective experiences fall outside the realm of scientific enquiry, or (2) that studying the functioning of animals is sufficient because subjective experiences and functioning are closely correlated. We argue that none of these positions provides fully satisfactory guidance for animal welfare research.We suggest instead that ethical concerns about the quality of life of animals can be better captured by recognizing three classes of problems that may arise when the adaptations possessed by an animal do not fully correspond to the challenges posed by its current environment. (I) If animals possess adaptations that no longer serve a significant function in the new environment, then unpleasant subjective experiences may arise, yet these may not be accompanied by significant disruption to biological functioning. Thus, a bucket-fed calf may experience a strong, frustrated desire to suck, even though it obtains adequate milk. (2) If the environment poses challenges for which the animal has no corresponding adaptation, then functional problems may arise, yet these may not be accompanied by significant effects on subjective feelings. Thus, a pig breathing polluted air may develop lung damage without appearing to notice or mind the problem. (3) Where animals have adaptations corresponding to the kinds of environmental challenges they face, problems may still arise if the adaptations prove inadequate. For example, an animal's thermoregulatory adaptations may be insufficient in a very cold environment such that the animal both feels poorly and functions poorly. We propose that all three types of problems are causes of ethical concern over the quality of life of animals and that they together define the subject matter of animal welfare science."

Over the last decade, emerging technologies such as 3D bioprinting, biofabrication, supramolecular materials, induced pluripotent stem cells, and organoids have entered the field. While this rapidly evolving field is expected to have great therapeutic potential, its development from bench to bedside presents several ethical and societal challenges. To make sure TE will reach its ultimate goal of improving patient welfare, these challenges should be mapped out and evaluated. Therefore, we performed a systematic review of the ethical implications of the development and application of TE for regenerative purposes, as mentioned in the academic literature. A search query in PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and PhilPapers yielded 2451 unique articles. After systematic screening, 237 relevant ethical and biomedical articles published between 2008 and 2021 were included in our review. We identified a broad range of ethical implications that could be categorized under 10 themes. Seven themes trace the development from bench to bedside: (1) animal experimentation, (2) handling human tissue, (3) informed consent, (4) therapeutic potential, (5) risk and safety, (6) clinical translation, and (7) societal impact. Three themes represent ethical safeguards relevant to all developmental phases: (8) scientific integrity, (9) regulation, and (10) patient and public involvement. This review reveals that since 2008 a significant body of literature has emerged on how to design clinical trials for TE in a responsible manner. However, several topics remain in need of more attention. These include the acceptability of alternative translational pathways outside clinical trials, soft impacts on society and questions of ownership over engineered tissues. Overall, this overview of the ethical and societal implications of the field will help promote responsible development of new interventions in TE and RM. It can also serve as a valuable resource and educational tool for scientists, engineers, and clinicians in the field by providing an overview of the ethical considerations relevant to their work. Impact statement To our knowledge, this is the first time that the ethical implications of Tissue Engineering (TE) have been reviewed systematically. By gathering existing scholarly work and identifying knowledge gaps, this review facilitates further research into the ethical and societal implications of TE and Regenerative Medicine (RM) and other emerging biomedical technologies. Moreover, it will serve as a valuable resource and educational tool for scientists, engineers, and clinicians in the field by providing an overview of the ethical considerations relevant to their work. As such, our review may promote successful and responsible development of new strategies in TE and RM."

But the genuine possibility of xenotransplantation is largely a creature of the last half-century. That possibility raises a plethora of genuine ethical issues, as well as spurious ones occasioned by societal ignorance of science. Abstract There are three sorts of issues associated with genetic engineering and, by implication, with xenotransplantation. These are dangers associated with the technology, animal welfare issues, and the claim that genetic engineering represents a technology that humans should not embark upon. Using the hearts of pigs for humans in need of transplants has been a major issue in xenotransplantation. There are dangers associated with such use, such as immunological rejection of the organ, endogenous viruses infecting the recipients, and issues of privacy. In addition, the issue of fair distribution of organs arises. Animal welfare issues also arise, most notably the living conditions of the donor animals, issues notably present in confinement agriculture. A major issue emerges from animals\u2019 being kept under conditions that fail to meet the needs dictated by the animals\u2019 biological and psychological natures. Xenotransplantation animals will be kept under deprived laboratory conditions that similarly fail to meet the animals\u2019 natures. This is a significant concern for society in general. There are also issues of \u201cbad ethics\u201d arising from scientists\u2019 disavowal of ethical concerns in science. This in turn, coupled with societal ignorance of science, creates a climate for proliferation of religious and other non-rational concerns, such as the claim that xenotransplantation violates God\u2019s will. These spurious concerns can only be ameliorated when public understanding of science improves, and scientific understanding of ethics increases.",
                    "[23169300 | Smetanka et al. | 2005 | Citations: 32]": "Xenotransplantation is the transplantation of organs and cells from one species to another: it has enormous potential to increase the supply of organs and tissues to alleviate human disease. Recent scientific progress has eliminated the obstacle of hyperacute rejection, which is the massive destruction of the transplanted organ within 24 h. Despite this progress and the tremendous clinical potential, a number of ethical issues require careful consideration. These issues involve the human recipients, source animals, biotechnology companies and ultimately, the general public. One of the greatest concerns is the potential risk that an infectious agent will be transferred with the organ to the recipient, from whom it may spread, leading to a possible epidemic. However, there is no current evidence that porcine endogenous retrovirus, which is the agent of greatest concern, will be pathogenic. Using modern biotechnology, it may be possible to generate pigs that are free of this virus in the near future. Addressing these issues deliberately and in a scientific manner, with public involvement and education, will result in a greater understanding of the risks and benefits of xenotransplantation. This knowledge can then be utilised to fulfil the increasing demand for transplantable organs, with minimal risk.",
                    "[32706555 | Morris et al. | 2004 | Citations: 6]": "The Ethics Committee of the International Xenotransplantation Association produced a position paper last year after widespread consultation on the ethical issues presented by potential clinical trials of xenotransplantation. We regarded this as an important contribution to the field and have reproduced it in our journal with permission in order to give it a wider exposure within the transplant community. Accompanying the paper are three commentaries on different aspects of this position paper. The authors argue the case for clinical xenotransplantation well and, with the ever-growing shortage of organs for transplantation, few would argue that xenotransplantation was not a potential solution to this problem. However, there are both scientific and ethical issues to be overcome before clinical trials could occur; this position paper concentrates on the ethical issues only. Apart from the normal ethical issues raised by the entry of any patient into a clinical trial, xenotransplantation presents specific problems related to the transplantation of a pig organ (the most favored donor species) into man. Truly informed consent will be difficult in a patient, who might have terminal organ failure. In addition, there is the potential problem of introducing infection into society; at this time, the Porcine Endogenous Retrovirus (PERV) is the potential pathogen of concern. Thus the committee correctly stresses the need to assess the risks and benefits of clinical xenotransplantation, not only to the prospective patient but also to society, before any clinical trials are considered. If the risk/ benefit analysis is favorable and experimental trials commence, the committee emphasizes the need for vigilant guidelines to monitor the transmission of infection (not only in the patient, but also in the patient\u2019s immediate contacts). Furthermore, these patients will have to accept the need for long-term monitoring. As part of this risk/benefit analysis, adequate preclinical data must be available to indicate that there is a reasonable chance of a successful outcome. The question of what defines adequate preclinical data is difficult to address, the authors admit, and needs to be assessed when the first trials are being considered. This implies the continuing experimental use of nonhuman primates, which the public has mixed views about, but which is essential to provide the required preclinical data. The authors correctly regard nonhuman primates as unsuitable organ donors, not only from an ethical point of view but also because of an increased risk of transmission of viral infection, but one can see the contradictory ethical dilemma that this presents. The pig is the chosen animal for donation, as it is generally acceptable to the public and is also acceptable from a physiological and anatomical point of view. The committee reviewed the religious views on xenotransplantation and found no serious objections from the monotheistic religions whereas the nonmonotheistic religions, primarily Buddhism and Hinduism, regard it as a matter for personal conscience. In their recommendations, the need for government regulation of clinical trials is stressed by the committee, along with the need for international cooperation to develop uniform operational standards and guidelines for clinical trials. It is suggested that the International Xenotranplantation Association might lead this initiative, but it might have a more powerful voice if done with the Transplantation Society under the umbrella of the World Health Organization. In the first of the three commentaries, Cooke and colleagues discuss the problems of informed consent and wonder whether a patient waiting for a pig heart transplant, when the alternative is death, can really give informed consent. Furthermore, the patient who has a xenotransplant is not in a position to withdraw from the experimental trial which contravenes the Declaration of Helsinki. They cite a similar situation in the recipient of an artificial heart. The authors also comment on the concept of beneficence both in the donor and in society, and express the hope that the small but real risks of PERV transmission will not delay clinical trials, provided the necessary preclinical data is available and the appropriate regulations are in place. The commentary by Einsiedel, although not downplaying the ethical issues, feels that the decision to proceed with clinical trials is a political one as much as a scientific one, and that the public needs to participate fully in this decision. This applies to any new technology but is even more important in xenotransplantation, where not only is there an additional pressure on the health resources of a country but also the risk to the public of the introduction of a new pathogen. Canadian, Dutch, and Australian public surveys have all suggested that a considerable degree of caution is required by the public, and that there is a need for more information before agreeing that clinical trials should proceed. On the other hand, Wright feels that the interpretation of the Canadian study was flawed and suggests that the data reveal a considerable degree of support for the concept of clinical xenotransplantation. Wright, in his concluding sentence, \u201cfeels that the public cannot provide useful insights into the critical safety and efficacy issues\u201d and these issues can only be addressed by carefully regulated trials when merited"

But the genuine possibility of xenotransplantation is largely a creature of the last half-century. That possibility raises a plethora of genuine ethical issues, as well as spurious ones occasioned by societal ignorance of science. Abstract There are three sorts of issues associated with genetic engineering and, by implication, with xenotransplantation. These are dangers associated with the technology, animal welfare issues, and the claim that genetic engineering represents a technology that humans should not embark upon. Using the hearts of pigs for humans in need of transplants has been a major issue in xenotransplantation. There are dangers associated with such use, such as immunological rejection of the organ, endogenous viruses infecting the recipients, and issues of privacy. In addition, the issue of fair distribution of organs arises. Animal welfare issues also arise, most notably the living conditions of the donor animals, issues notably present in confinement agriculture. A major issue emerges from animals\u2019 being kept under conditions that fail to meet the needs dictated by the animals\u2019 biological and psychological natures. Xenotransplantation animals will be kept under deprived laboratory conditions that similarly fail to meet the animals\u2019 natures. This is a significant concern for society in general. There are also issues of \u201cbad ethics\u201d arising from scientists\u2019 disavowal of ethical concerns in science. This in turn, coupled with societal ignorance of science, creates a climate for proliferation of religious and other non-rational concerns, such as the claim that xenotransplantation violates God\u2019s will. These spurious concerns can only be ameliorated when public understanding of science improves, and scientific understanding of ethics increases.",

While recent advances have brought this future closer, worries remain about whether it will be beneficial overall. The unique challenges and risks posed to humans that arise from transplanting across the species barrier, in addition to the costs borne by non\u2010human animals, has led some to question the value of xenotransplantation altogether. In response, we defend the value of xenotransplantation research, because it can satisfy stringent welfare conditions on the permissibility of animal research and use. Along the way, we respond to the alleged concerns, and conclude that they do not currently warrant a cessation or a curtailing of xenotransplantation research."

Religious views have been mentioned as possible barriers to XTx acceptance. While there have been reports on perspectives of theologians in regard to XTx, no report has studied the perspectives of community religious leaders. A focus group was conducted with a sample of members of the following faith groups: Islam, Catholicism, and Protestantism. Qualitative content analysis was performed to identify interpretive themes. Four themes emerged. Participants were receptive to the idea of XTx and expressed no religious barriers to accepting a pig xenograft as a lifesaving therapy but did express certain concerns. Religious leaders accept the idea of XTx and do not see it as contradictory to their beliefs. However, some concerns were raised. Future studies addressing these concerns and exploring the potential role of religious leaders in educating the community on XTx are needed."

Let me identify the key dimensions that will help organize the information from the quotes.\n\nFirst, I'll need an \"Introduction/Background\" section to provide context about what xenotransplantation is and why it's being pursued. This will help frame the ethical challenges that follow.\n\nFor the main ethical challenges related to animal welfare and rights, I can identify several key dimensions:\n\n1. \"Housing and Living Conditions of Donor Animals\" - This dimension addresses the specific query about housing conditions of donor animals. Many quotes discuss concerns about sterile, laboratory environments that restrict natural behaviors. This should be a synthesis format to explain the tensions between animal welfare and medical requirements.\n\n2. \"Genetic Modification of Donor Animals\" - This directly addresses the query about genetic modification ethical concerns. Multiple quotes discuss issues related to genetic engineering of pigs for xenotransplantation. This should be synthesis to comprehensively explain the concerns.\n\n3. \"Animal Rights and Moral Status\" - This dimension examines the philosophical aspects of using animals as organ sources. Quotes discuss the moral status of animals, anthropocentrism, and whether it's justified to use animals for human benefit. Synthesis format would allow for deeper exploration of these philosophical issues.\n\n4. \"Balance of Harm versus Benefit\" - Several quotes discuss weighing animal suffering against potential human benefits. This dimension should be synthesis to present different perspectives on this ethical calculus.\n\n5. \"Regulatory and Oversight Considerations\" - This dimension addresses standards and guidelines for ethical treatment of donor animals. This should be synthesis to explain oversight mechanisms.\n\nThese dimensions cover the main ethical challenges while directly addressing the specific concerns in the query about genetic modification and housing conditions. Each dimension will be presented in synthesis format to provide cohesive explanations rather than disjointed lists, as the ethical challenges are complex and interconnected.",

                "tldr": "The housing conditions for donor animals in xenotransplantation present a significant ethical dilemma, as they require sterile, pathogen-free environments that severely restrict natural behaviors. While these controlled conditions are necessary to prevent disease transmission to human recipients, they conflict with the animals' natural instincts and welfare needs, creating tension between human medical benefits and animal well-being. (12 sources)",
                "text": "\nThe housing and care of source animals for xenotransplantation represents a major ethical challenge that must be addressed as clinical applications advance. Donor animals, primarily pigs, require specific housing conditions that differ significantly from their natural environments. These animals must be kept in sterile, laboratory-like conditions to prevent disease transmission to human recipients <Paper corpusId=\"232385374\" paperTitle=\"(Ryczek et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"249734546\" paperTitle=\"(Boulet et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"221306753\" paperTitle=\"(Cengiz et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nA fundamental tension exists between the requirements for infection control and animal welfare. As Syd et al. note, \"The prevention of infectious disease in source animals is in tension with the best practices of animal care and animal welfare, requiring isolation, ethologically inappropriate housing, and invasive reproductive procedures that would severely impact the well-being of intelligent social creatures like pigs\" <Paper corpusId=\"249396016\" paperTitle=\"(Syd et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. These conditions prevent pigs from engaging in natural behaviors and interacting with other animals, contradicting their instinctive needs <Paper corpusId=\"249476391\" paperTitle=\"(Carrier et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe Changsha Communiqu\u00e9 has established guidelines stating that animals used in xenotransplantation should be \"acquired from a closed herd bred for the purpose of xenotransplantation and housed in a well-controlled, pathogen-free environment with high animal welfare standards\" <Paper corpusId=\"257934763\" paperTitle=\"(Ma et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This emphasizes the importance of balancing biosecurity with welfare concerns, though achieving both simultaneously remains challenging.\n\nFrom an anthropocentric perspective, donor animals receive exceptionally high levels of care and attention. Hawthorne argues that \"the facilities and conditions that these animals are housed and the care they receive is of a superior level to a normal commercial piggery due to the highly controlled and run facilities including the need for donor animals to be in DPF facilities\" <Paper corpusId=\"267567406\" paperTitle=\"(Hawthorne, 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. This view suggests that the level of suffering could be considered minimal compared to the potential life-saving benefits for human patients.\n\nHowever, when viewed from the animals' perspective, these sterile conditions may actually be worse than agricultural breeding environments despite the high level of care provided <Paper corpusId=\"232385374\" paperTitle=\"(Ryczek et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. As Rollin points out, \"Xenotransplantation animals will be kept under deprived laboratory conditions that similarly fail to meet the animals' natures. This is a significant concern for society in general\" <Paper corpusId=\"221862396\" paperTitle=\"(Rollin, 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe ethical framework for housing donor animals must comply with established guidelines for animal care in research. At minimum, the use of source animals for xenotransplantation must adhere to standards like those outlined by the Canadian Council on Animal Care's Guide to the Care and Use of Experimental Animals <Paper corpusId=\"28577007\" paperTitle=\"(Sim et al., 1999)\" isShortName></Paper>. Additionally, all animal research projects, including the breeding, care, and handling of animals, must be conducted under strict compliance with animal ethics legislation and under the scrutiny of ethics committees <Paper corpusId=\"267567406\" paperTitle=\"(Hawthorne, 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nCritics argue that the large-scale farming of pigs for xenotransplantation inevitably subjects animals to \"truncated lives under unnatural conditions\" where \"pathogen-free environments require excluding animals from their natural pasture habitat and raising them in sterile, indoor housing, which severely limits their natural range of animal behavior and social interactions\" <Paper corpusId=\"276315377\" paperTitle=\"(Krebs et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>. This perspective emphasizes that each pig used is \"a cognitively complex animal with the capacity for significant suffering\" <Paper corpusId=\"276315377\" paperTitle=\"(Krebs et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe ethical tension between necessary biosecurity measures and animal welfare remains a central challenge for the field of xenotransplantation. As clinical applications advance, balancing the \"public's concern not to face a new pandemic\" with humane care practices for donor pigs continues to be a significant consideration for research teams <Paper corpusId=\"258989094\" paperTitle=\"(Negri et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"248389916\" paperTitle=\"(Rothblatt, 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.",

Harvesting organs from these animals and transplanting them into humans will in most cases result in the death of the animal. Moreover, another aspect concerns the welfare of animals bred for xenotransplantation. These animals are likely to be kept in sterile, laboratory-like conditions. From a human standpoint, the level of care provided to these animals will be the highest. However, when we change to the animal perspective, these conditions may be worse than in agricultural breeding. This type of approach is anthropocentric and puts human life above that of other animal species (Cengiz et al., 2020)."

Recent findings Developments within xenotransplantation may soon allow for pig-to-human xenotransplantation to take place. Ethical analysis of xenotransplantation commonly follows an anthropocentric cost\u2013benefit analysis, which may imprecisely measure costs. Xenotransplantation should not merely be approached from an anthropocentric perspective. Rather, the potential risks presented to human and nonhuman donors, recipients, and third parties should all be thoroughly considered. Summary The range of feasible alternatives to xenotransplantation to increase organ supply should be examined before resorting to xenotransplantation because of the moral distinction between imposing certain risks on others before, or after, alternative solutions have been exhausted."

                            "The use of pigs engineered to grow organs with a low likelihood of rejection raises a number of ethical concerns. Transplant teams utilizing xenografts as a source of donor organs should be prepared to discuss these issues as the regular use of xenografts moves forward in \"daily\" clinical practice. There are many social benefits that xenotransplantation can help realize, namely relief of the long wait times for a suitable allograft, reduction in dialysis complications, and, especially in some parts of the world, elimination of coercion and financial compensation for organs (Wijkstrom et al., 2017)",
                            "There are additionally those who eschew the use of animals and/or animal products as a source of food or dry goods for either religious or animal welfare concerns, and these individuals may take issue with utilization of xenografts as a resource for reducing the transplant wait list (88). There are others still that take issue with raising animals with the exclusive intent of utilizing their organs for xenotransplantation, though the anticipated number of animals needed for this purpose is significantly smaller than the more than 100 million animals killed for food each year in the US alone (82,88).\n\nPigs raised as a source of xenografts would likely require confinement to reduce the risk of infection and subsequent transmission of an infection to the future recipient of the xenograft. Animals raised under such conditions would not be in an environment in which they would be able to freely roam and interact with other animals like some of their farm-raised counterparts (12,88). This leads to a conflict among those with animal welfare concerns because the need to raise a xenograftdonor pig in a sterile environment to protect the recipient is in direct conflict with the pig's natural instincts and needs. The degree of influence of both sides of this conflict has not yet been defined and warrants further exploration involving all stakeholders."

One could argue that the facilities and conditions that these animals are housed and the care they receive is of a superior level to a normal commercial piggery due to the highly controlled and run facilities including the need for donor animals to be in DPF facilities. Underpinning this is the fact that all animal research projects including the breeding of, care and handling of the animals are undertaken in strict compliance under animal ethics legislation and under scrutiny of ethics committees (6). The genetic modifications required for these donor animals have been carefully designed to ensure they do not affect the health of the source pigs at all. Therefor from an ethical standpoint the level of suffering could be perceived as minimal or negligible. On the other hand, the potential benefit for patients is very high, being lifesaving and life changing (6).\n\nThere are also the ethical concerns for pre-clinical study recipients the various animals used and especially the non-humanprimates (NHP) which are the benchmark for preclinical trials. Their use is highly recommended prior to acceptance of any program moving to the clinic, and has been advised in many guidance's such as the \"Changsha Communique\" that recommend their use to provide safe and efficacious treatment regimen and modalities prior to commencement of any clinical trials (4)."

Questions such as how to justly allocate organs among patients in need, which patients should be chosen as initial recipients of experimental xenotransplant, how to obtain informed consent from vulnerable populations, and how to ensure access to long-term novel immunosuppression are well considered in existing scholarship, while public health risks and the viability of alternative strategies to increase organ availability are given less coverage.

While these modifications are necessary to make pig organs compatible with humans, they create tension between human medical needs and animal welfare considerations. (10 sources)",
                "text": "\nGenetic modification represents a core ethical challenge in xenotransplantation, as it involves altering animals' genetic makeup to make their organs compatible with human recipients. A primary concern is whether extensive genetic alterations fundamentally disturb the nature of the species. However, some argue that \"selective breeding has caused more extensive modifications than the ten genetic alterations engineered for xenotransplantation\" <Paper corpusId=\"258276646\" paperTitle=\"(Santos, 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"253552364\" paperTitle=\"(George, 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe ethical debate over genetic engineering for xenotransplantation encompasses three main areas: \"the first argues that certain scientific experiments should simply not be undertaken; the second warns of unforeseen consequences of genetically altering organisms; and the third pertains to the suffering of involved animals\" <Paper corpusId=\"262207976\" paperTitle=\"(Kwisda, 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"221862396\" paperTitle=\"(Rollin, 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. Animal rights organizations frequently oppose such modifications on principle, considering the practice too anthropocentric by prioritizing human needs over other species <Paper corpusId=\"258622380\" paperTitle=\"(Koh et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"221306753\" paperTitle=\"(Cengiz et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nWhen modifying pig genomes for xenotransplantation, scientists must carefully consider how these alterations might affect the animals' welfare. As Xuan et al. note, \"when manipulating the pig genome to create humanized pigs for xenotransplantation, it is essential to carefully assess gene modifications to avoid harming the animals' physical and mental health\" <Paper corpusId=\"260980005\" paperTitle=\"(Xuan et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This concern relates to ensuring that donor animals \"live well, feel well, and function well\" <Paper corpusId=\"44468626\" paperTitle=\"(Fraser et al., 1997)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nProponents of xenotransplantation argue that the genetic modifications required for donor animals \"have been carefully designed to ensure they do not affect the health of the source pigs at all\" <Paper corpusId=\"267567406\" paperTitle=\"(Hawthorne, 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. From this perspective, the suffering of donor animals could be considered minimal compared to the potential life-saving benefits for human patients. All procedures involving these genetically modified animals are conducted \"in strict compliance under animal ethics legislation and under scrutiny of ethics committees\" <Paper corpusId=\"267567406\" paperTitle=\"(Hawthorne, 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nLooking forward, the ethical implications of genetic engineering for xenotransplantation require broader societal discussion. As genetic engineering techniques advance, it becomes increasingly important to reach a \"consensus of the moral, ethical, and societal implications of using genetically modified animals for organ transplantation\" <Paper corpusId=\"268641927\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. This includes addressing animal welfare concerns, potential environmental impacts, and long-term outcomes for transplant recipients.\n\nThe ethical tension surrounding genetic modification of donor animals centers on balancing scientific progress and human medical needs against concerns for animal welfare and species integrity. This represents a fundamental challenge that must be addressed as xenotransplantation moves toward wider clinical application.",

Recent findings Developments within xenotransplantation may soon allow for pig-to-human xenotransplantation to take place. Ethical analysis of xenotransplantation commonly follows an anthropocentric cost\u2013benefit analysis, which may imprecisely measure costs. Xenotransplantation should not merely be approached from an anthropocentric perspective. Rather, the potential risks presented to human and nonhuman donors, recipients, and third parties should all be thoroughly considered. Summary The range of feasible alternatives to xenotransplantation to increase organ supply should be examined before resorting to xenotransplantation because of the moral distinction between imposing certain risks on others before, or after, alternative solutions have been exhausted."

                            "Scientific research on \u2018animal welfare\u2019 began because of ethical concerns over the quality of life of animals, and the public looks to animal welfare research for guidance regarding these concerns. The conception of animal welfare used by scientists must relate closely to these ethical concerns if the orientation of the research and the interpretation of the findings is to address them successfully.At least three overlapping ethical concerns are commonly expressed regarding the quality of life of animals: (1) that animals should lead natural lives through the development and use of their natural adaptations and capabilities, (2) that animals should feel well by being free from prolonged and intense fear, pain, and other negative states, and by experiencing normal pleasures, and (3) that animals should function well, in the sense of satisfactory health, growth and normal functioning of physiological and behavioural systems. Various scientists have proposed restricted conceptions of animal welfare that relate to only one or other of these three concerns. Some such conceptions are based on value positions about what is truly important for the quality of life of animals or about the nature of human responsibility for animals in their care. Others are operational claims: (1) that animal welfare research must focus on the functioning of animals because subjective experiences fall outside the realm of scientific enquiry, or (2) that studying the functioning of animals is sufficient because subjective experiences and functioning are closely correlated. We argue that none of these positions provides fully satisfactory guidance for animal welfare research.We suggest instead that ethical concerns about the quality of life of animals can be better captured by recognizing three classes of problems that may arise when the adaptations possessed by an animal do not fully correspond to the challenges posed by its current environment. (I) If animals possess adaptations that no longer serve a significant function in the new environment, then unpleasant subjective experiences may arise, yet these may not be accompanied by significant disruption to biological functioning. Thus, a bucket-fed calf may experience a strong, frustrated desire to suck, even though it obtains adequate milk. (2) If the environment poses challenges for which the animal has no corresponding adaptation, then functional problems may arise, yet these may not be accompanied by significant effects on subjective feelings. Thus, a pig breathing polluted air may develop lung damage without appearing to notice or mind the problem. (3) Where animals have adaptations corresponding to the kinds of environmental challenges they face, problems may still arise if the adaptations prove inadequate. For example, an animal's thermoregulatory adaptations may be insufficient in a very cold environment such that the animal both feels poorly and functions poorly. We propose that all three types of problems are causes of ethical concern over the quality of life of animals and that they together define the subject matter of animal welfare science."

                            "The major issues raised are to ensure the donor pigs are being ethically and humanely cared for and ensure the process of genetic manipulation does not cause them any health issues. One could argue that the facilities and conditions that these animals are housed and the care they receive is of a superior level to a normal commercial piggery due to the highly controlled and run facilities including the need for donor animals to be in DPF facilities. Underpinning this is the fact that all animal research projects including the breeding of, care and handling of the animals are undertaken in strict compliance under animal ethics legislation and under scrutiny of ethics committees (6). The genetic modifications required for these donor animals have been carefully designed to ensure they do not affect the health of the source pigs at all. Therefor from an ethical standpoint the level of suffering could be perceived as minimal or negligible. On the other hand, the potential benefit for patients is very high, being lifesaving and life changing (6).\n\nThere are also the ethical concerns for pre-clinical study recipients the various animals used and especially the non-humanprimates (NHP) which are the benchmark for preclinical trials. Their use is highly recommended prior to acceptance of any program moving to the clinic, and has been advised in many guidance's such as the \"Changsha Communique\" that recommend their use to provide safe and efficacious treatment regimen and modalities prior to commencement of any clinical trials (4)."

This creates tension between anthropocentric views that prioritize human survival and animal rights perspectives that recognize pigs as sentient beings capable of suffering. (15 sources)",
                "text": "\nA fundamental ethical challenge in xenotransplantation concerns the moral status of donor animals and whether humans are justified in using them as sources of organs. This question strikes at the core of animal rights considerations and forces us to confront our assumptions about the relationship between humans and other species. As Oli et al. note, \"An animal rights issue arises because animals, like humans, also have rights to existence and should not be sacrificed in favor of humans\" <Paper corpusId=\"253286042\" paperTitle=\"(Oli et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"221306753\" paperTitle=\"(Cengiz et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nMany critics argue that xenotransplantation represents an anthropocentric worldview that places human interests above those of other species. This perspective \"puts human life above that of other animal species\" and raises questions about whether such prioritization is ethically justified <Paper corpusId=\"232385374\" paperTitle=\"(Ryczek et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"221306753\" paperTitle=\"(Cengiz et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. Similarly, Boulet et al. highlight \"the anthropocentric view of putting humans above all other animal species\" as a major ethical consideration in xenotransplantation <Paper corpusId=\"249734546\" paperTitle=\"(Boulet et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"221306753\" paperTitle=\"(Cengiz et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe ethical analysis of xenotransplantation often employs a cost-benefit framework that may inadequately account for animal interests. Cengiz et al. argue that \"Xenotransplantation should not merely be approached from an anthropocentric perspective. Rather, the potential risks presented to human and nonhuman donors, recipients, and third parties should all be thoroughly considered\" <Paper corpusId=\"249734546\" paperTitle=\"(Boulet et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"221306753\" paperTitle=\"(Cengiz et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. This suggests the need for a more balanced ethical framework that considers both human and animal welfare.\n\nA central problem in this debate is that animals cannot provide informed consent for their use as organ sources. As Andrade et al. explain, \"In human-to-human organ transplantation, informed consent is typically obtained from donors or their families. In xenotransplantation, there is no way to obtain informed consent from the donor animals, raising ethical questions about the use of animals for the benefit of humans without their consent\" <Paper corpusId=\"267749482\" paperTitle=\"(Andrade et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"221862396\" paperTitle=\"(Rollin, 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"255213612\" paperTitle=\"(Bobier et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nMany animal rights organizations oppose xenotransplantation on principle, reflecting broader concerns about animal exploitation <Paper corpusId=\"258276646\" paperTitle=\"(Santos, 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. Krebs et al. argue that \"Every pig and nonhuman primate used in these contexts is a cognitively complex animal with the capacity for significant suffering\" <Paper corpusId=\"276315377\" paperTitle=\"(Krebs et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>. This perspective recognizes that pigs possess cognitive abilities and emotional capacities that merit moral consideration.\n\nFor vegetarians and those with certain religious beliefs, xenotransplantation presents a particular ethical dilemma. Thuan et al. note that \"For vegetarians, an ethical dilemma arises regarding sacrificing the lives of animals to save others, since animals and humans are also sentient beings\" <Paper corpusId=\"271513704\" paperTitle=\"(Thuan et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"252108828\" paperTitle=\"(Hurst et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. However, some religious perspectives prioritize human life, with certain religious leaders indicating that xenotransplantation doesn't contradict their beliefs despite dietary restrictions <Paper corpusId=\"271513704\" paperTitle=\"(Thuan et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"252108828\" paperTitle=\"(Hurst et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThere is general agreement that some use of animals to benefit humans can be ethically justified, though this justification varies by species. As Zhai notes, \"Most people agree that it is at least sometimes justified to use animals to improve human welfare, but we also agree that we should minimize animal suffering, and that there are relevant differences between animal species. For example, most people reject using nonhuman primates to produce organs for human transplantation. However, the use of pigs is considered more acceptable\" <Paper corpusId=\"252891241\" paperTitle=\"(Zhai, 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nProponents of xenotransplantation point to significant potential benefits, including \"relief of the long wait times for a suitable allograft, reduction in dialysis complications, and, especially in some parts of the world, elimination of coercion and financial compensation for organs\" <Paper corpusId=\"249476391\" paperTitle=\"(Carrier et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. They also note that the number of animals needed for xenotransplantation would be \"significantly smaller than the more than 100 million animals killed for food each year in the US alone\" <Paper corpusId=\"249476391\" paperTitle=\"(Carrier et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nFrom a theological ethics perspective, Tanveer et al. suggest that \"a complete ban on xenotransplantation is not justifiable. Instead, the practice should be conducted responsibly, preserving human dignity and autonomy while ensuring the ethical treatment of animals\" <Paper corpusId=\"263276573\" paperTitle=\"(Tanveer et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This middle-ground position acknowledges both the value of human life and the importance of animal welfare considerations.\n\nAs xenotransplantation moves toward clinical implementation, Eissa et al. emphasize that scientists and clinicians must thoroughly address animal welfare concerns, warning that \"unless there are major changes in the way science is taught to incorporate ethics into recognized scientific theory and practice, these concerns will not be adequately addressed\" <Paper corpusId=\"255364318\" paperTitle=\"(Eissa et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.

Recent findings Developments within xenotransplantation may soon allow for pig-to-human xenotransplantation to take place. Ethical analysis of xenotransplantation commonly follows an anthropocentric cost\u2013benefit analysis, which may imprecisely measure costs. Xenotransplantation should not merely be approached from an anthropocentric perspective. Rather, the potential risks presented to human and nonhuman donors, recipients, and third parties should all be thoroughly considered. Summary The range of feasible alternatives to xenotransplantation to increase organ supply should be examined before resorting to xenotransplantation because of the moral distinction between imposing certain risks on others before, or after, alternative solutions have been exhausted."

Harvesting organs from these animals and transplanting them into humans will in most cases result in the death of the animal. Moreover, another aspect concerns the welfare of animals bred for xenotransplantation. These animals are likely to be kept in sterile, laboratory-like conditions. From a human standpoint, the level of care provided to these animals will be the highest. However, when we change to the animal perspective, these conditions may be worse than in agricultural breeding. This type of approach is anthropocentric and puts human life above that of other animal species (Cengiz et al., 2020)."

While recent advances have brought this future closer, worries remain about whether it will be beneficial overall. The unique challenges and risks posed to humans that arise from transplanting across the species barrier, in addition to the costs borne by non\u2010human animals, has led some to question the value of xenotransplantation altogether. In response, we defend the value of xenotransplantation research, because it can satisfy stringent welfare conditions on the permissibility of animal research and use. Along the way, we respond to the alleged concerns, and conclude that they do not currently warrant a cessation or a curtailing of xenotransplantation research."

Questions such as how to justly allocate organs among patients in need, which patients should be chosen as initial recipients of experimental xenotransplant, how to obtain informed consent from vulnerable populations, and how to ensure access to long-term novel immunosuppression are well considered in existing scholarship, while public health risks and the viability of alternative strategies to increase organ availability are given less coverage.

Despite being a source of food for millennia, ethical concerns arise when considering the use of animals for living organs (Clark, 1999)(Mani et al., 2003). Some religious traditions, such as Judaism and Islam, prohibit pork consumption, yet some leaders consider pig organ transplants acceptable to preserve human life. For vegetarians, an ethical dilemma arises regarding sacrificing the lives of animals to save others, since animals and humans are also sentient beings (Hurst et al., 2022). Despite these ethical considerations, pigs remain a suitable donor source for heart transplantation [42]."

While there have been reports on perspectives of theologians in regard to XTx, no report has studied the perspectives of community religious leaders. A focus group was conducted with a sample of members of the following faith groups: Islam, Catholicism, and Protestantism. Qualitative content analysis was performed to identify interpretive themes. Four themes emerged. Participants were receptive to the idea of XTx and expressed no religious barriers to accepting a pig xenograft as a lifesaving therapy but did express certain concerns. Religious leaders accept the idea of XTx and do not see it as contradictory to their beliefs. However, some concerns were raised. Future studies addressing these concerns and exploring the potential role of religious leaders in educating the community on XTx are needed."

Transplant teams utilizing xenografts as a source of donor organs should be prepared to discuss these issues as the regular use of xenografts moves forward in \"daily\" clinical practice. There are many social benefits that xenotransplantation can help realize, namely relief of the long wait times for a suitable allograft, reduction in dialysis complications, and, especially in some parts of the world, elimination of coercion and financial compensation for organs (Wijkstrom et al., 2017)",
                            "There are additionally those who eschew the use of animals and/or animal products as a source of food or dry goods for either religious or animal welfare concerns, and these individuals may take issue with utilization of xenografts as a resource for reducing the transplant wait list (88). There are others still that take issue with raising animals with the exclusive intent of utilizing their organs for xenotransplantation, though the anticipated number of animals needed for this purpose is significantly smaller than the more than 100 million animals killed for food each year in the US alone (82,88).\n\nPigs raised as a source of xenografts would likely require confinement to reduce the risk of infection and subsequent transmission of an infection to the future recipient of the xenograft. Animals raised under such conditions would not be in an environment in which they would be able to freely roam and interact with other animals like some of their farm-raised counterparts (12,88). This leads to a conflict among those with animal welfare concerns because the need to raise a xenograftdonor pig in a sterile environment to protect the recipient is in direct conflict with the pig's natural instincts and needs. The degree of influence of both sides of this conflict has not yet been defined and warrants further exploration involving all stakeholders."

While the practice offers life-saving potential for patients awaiting organs, it requires careful consideration of how to minimize animal suffering while maximizing human benefit. (6 sources)",
                "text": "\nThe ethical assessment of xenotransplantation ultimately requires balancing potential benefits to humans against harms to donor animals. Proponents highlight several significant social benefits, including \"relief of the long wait times for a suitable allograft, reduction in dialysis complications, and, especially in some parts of the world, elimination of coercion and financial compensation for organs\" <Paper corpusId=\"249476391\" paperTitle=\"(Carrier et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. From this perspective, the potential to save human lives presents a compelling ethical justification for the practice.\n\nWhen comparing xenotransplantation to other uses of animals, advocates point out that \"the anticipated number of animals needed for this purpose is significantly smaller than the more than 100 million animals killed for food each year in the US alone\" <Paper corpusId=\"249476391\" paperTitle=\"(Carrier et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. This comparative approach suggests that the scale of animal use for xenotransplantation would be relatively limited compared to other accepted practices involving animals.\n\nThere is general agreement that some use of animals to benefit humans can be ethically justified, with species-based distinctions affecting moral calculations. As Zhai notes, \"Most people agree that it is at least sometimes justified to use animals to improve human welfare, but we also agree that we should minimize animal suffering, and that there are relevant differences between animal species\" <Paper corpusId=\"252891241\" paperTitle=\"(Zhai, 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. This explains why using pigs is typically considered more acceptable than using non-human primates for organ sourcing.\n\nFrom an anthropocentric perspective, the potential benefits for human patients are substantial\u2014\"being lifesaving and life changing\"\u2014while the suffering of donor animals could be perceived as \"minimal or negligible\" given the high standards of care in specialized facilities <Paper corpusId=\"267567406\" paperTitle=\"(Hawthorne, 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. Proponents argue that the genetic modifications required for xenotransplantation \"have been carefully designed to ensure they do not affect the health of the source pigs at all\" <Paper corpusId=\"267567406\" paperTitle=\"(Hawthorne, 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nHowever, critics argue that this harm-benefit analysis often undervalues animal interests. The large-scale farming of pigs for xenotransplantation requires animals to \"live truncated lives under unnatural conditions\" where pathogen-free environments necessitate \"sterile, indoor housing, which severely limits their natural range of animal behavior and social interactions\" <Paper corpusId=\"276315377\" paperTitle=\"(Krebs et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>. This perspective emphasizes that \"every pig and nonhuman primate used in these contexts is a cognitively complex animal with the capacity for significant suffering\" <Paper corpusId=\"276315377\" paperTitle=\"(Krebs et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nA central ethical tension emerges from the fact that \"the need to raise a xenograft donor pig in a sterile environment to protect the recipient is in direct conflict with the pig's natural instincts and needs\" <Paper corpusId=\"249476391\" paperTitle=\"(Carrier et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. This conflict warrants further exploration involving all stakeholders to determine how to balance these competing interests.\n\nFrom a theological ethics perspective, a complete ban on xenotransplantation appears unjustified. Instead, \"the practice should be conducted responsibly, preserving human dignity and autonomy while ensuring the ethical treatment of animals\" <Paper corpusId=\"263276573\" paperTitle=\"(Tanveer et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This middle-ground position acknowledges both the value of human life and the importance of animal welfare considerations.\n\nAs xenotransplantation moves toward wider clinical application, scientists and clinicians must thoroughly address animal welfare concerns. Eissa et al. warn that \"unless there are major changes in the way science is taught to incorporate ethics into recognized scientific theory and practice, these concerns will not be adequately addressed\" <Paper corpusId=\"255364318\" paperTitle=\"(Eissa et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. This highlights the need for ethical training and awareness among researchers in the field to ensure responsible development of xenotransplantation technologies.\n\nThe ethical balance in xenotransplantation ultimately requires weighing significant potential benefits to human patients against legitimate animal welfare concerns, while striving to minimize harm to donor animals through ethical oversight, humane care practices, and continued refinement of techniques.",

                            "The use of pigs engineered to grow organs with a low likelihood of rejection raises a number of ethical concerns. Transplant teams utilizing xenografts as a source of donor organs should be prepared to discuss these issues as the regular use of xenografts moves forward in \"daily\" clinical practice. There are many social benefits that xenotransplantation can help realize, namely relief of the long wait times for a suitable allograft, reduction in dialysis complications, and, especially in some parts of the world, elimination of coercion and financial compensation for organs (Wijkstrom et al., 2017)",
                            "There are additionally those who eschew the use of animals and/or animal products as a source of food or dry goods for either religious or animal welfare concerns, and these individuals may take issue with utilization of xenografts as a resource for reducing the transplant wait list (88). There are others still that take issue with raising animals with the exclusive intent of utilizing their organs for xenotransplantation, though the anticipated number of animals needed for this purpose is significantly smaller than the more than 100 million animals killed for food each year in the US alone (82,88).\n\nPigs raised as a source of xenografts would likely require confinement to reduce the risk of infection and subsequent transmission of an infection to the future recipient of the xenograft. Animals raised under such conditions would not be in an environment in which they would be able to freely roam and interact with other animals like some of their farm-raised counterparts (12,88). This leads to a conflict among those with animal welfare concerns because the need to raise a xenograftdonor pig in a sterile environment to protect the recipient is in direct conflict with the pig's natural instincts and needs. The degree of influence of both sides of this conflict has not yet been defined and warrants further exploration involving all stakeholders."

One could argue that the facilities and conditions that these animals are housed and the care they receive is of a superior level to a normal commercial piggery due to the highly controlled and run facilities including the need for donor animals to be in DPF facilities. Underpinning this is the fact that all animal research projects including the breeding of, care and handling of the animals are undertaken in strict compliance under animal ethics legislation and under scrutiny of ethics committees (6). The genetic modifications required for these donor animals have been carefully designed to ensure they do not affect the health of the source pigs at all. Therefor from an ethical standpoint the level of suffering could be perceived as minimal or negligible. On the other hand, the potential benefit for patients is very high, being lifesaving and life changing (6).\n\nThere are also the ethical concerns for pre-clinical study recipients the various animals used and especially the non-humanprimates (NHP) which are the benchmark for preclinical trials. Their use is highly recommended prior to acceptance of any program moving to the clinic, and has been advised in many guidance's such as the \"Changsha Communique\" that recommend their use to provide safe and efficacious treatment regimen and modalities prior to commencement of any clinical trials (4)."

Questions such as how to justly allocate organs among patients in need, which patients should be chosen as initial recipients of experimental xenotransplant, how to obtain informed consent from vulnerable populations, and how to ensure access to long-term novel immunosuppression are well considered in existing scholarship, while public health risks and the viability of alternative strategies to increase organ availability are given less coverage. In addition, there are myriad ethical issues related to nonhuman animals' use in xenotransplant research and practice, including their sentience, suffering, and moral status, but discussions fall short by making inappropriate comparisons to animal use for food or by focusing strictly on animal welfare",
                            "As with animal agriculture, the large-scale farming of pigs for xenotransplantation requires animals to live truncated lives under unnatural conditions. Pathogen-free environments require excluding animals from their natural pasture habitat and raising them in sterile, indoor housing, which severely limits their natural range of animal behavior and social interactions. Captivity, isolation, handling, transport, and other standard conditions of modern pig farming cause significant stress responses in pigs, with a variety of biological and physiological consequences",

As with genetic modification to fix genetic defects or prevent disease, the ideal outcome for these animals is that they will be better off as a result of the change. However, unless there are major changes in the way science is taught to incorporate ethics into recognized scientific theory and practice, these concerns will not be adequately addressed"
