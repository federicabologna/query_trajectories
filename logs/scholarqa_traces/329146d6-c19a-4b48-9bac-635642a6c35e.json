In one example, a liposome termed a \"nanoprimer\" was used to saturate Kupffer cell-mediated clearance 10 min prior to administration of LNP containing Cy5.5 labeled human erythropoietin mRNA or factor VII siRNA, resulting in increased systemic fluorescence at 1 h post-dose and increased erythropoietin or decreased factor VII protein expression at 48 h post-dose, respectively [34]. Clever mRNA modifications have also been made in an attempt to reduce off-target liver expression by the design of hepatic-selective, suppressive micro-RNA (miRNA) binding sites into the untranslated regions of the mRNA [35].",

In one example, a liposome termed a \"nanoprimer\" was used to saturate Kupffer cell-mediated clearance 10 min prior to administration of LNP containing Cy5.5 labeled human erythropoietin mRNA or factor VII siRNA, resulting in increased systemic fluorescence at 1 h post-dose and increased erythropoietin or decreased factor VII protein expression at 48 h post-dose, respectively [34]. Clever mRNA modifications have also been made in an attempt to reduce off-target liver expression by the design of hepatic-selective, suppressive micro-RNA (miRNA) binding sites into the untranslated regions of the mRNA [35].",

Unwanted liver accumulation of mRNA-loaded LNPs can be minimized by reticuloendothelial-systemblockade strategies such as stealth coating of liver sinusoids using two-arm-PEG-Oligo(l-Lysine). These RES-blockade strategies improved selective organ targeting of nucleic acid therapeutics by dramatically decreasing accumulation in the liver [15]. Another significant hurdle to the widespread utility of LNPs is their indispensable component: ionizable lipids. These lipids are not only highly inflammatory but also generate electrophilic impurities. These impurities can give rise to reactive moieties, including reactive oxygenated species, which can hydrolyze tertiary amines, rendering the mRNA untranslatable and leading to a loss of protein expression [16,17]. Moreover, delivering LNPs to targeted organs is often challenging due to obstacles like the blood-brain barrier and the immune system. Addressing the immune response triggered by LNPs remains a significant challenge. Stealth coatings and immunomodulators can help mitigate this issue. Nanotechnology is a multidisciplinary science that uses fundamental aspects of physics, chemistry, and mathematics to design and manipulate atoms and molecules at the nanoscale to produce structures 1-1000 nm in size. Because of their small size and high surface area, the use of nanoparticles has resulted in improved drug solubility and enhanced bioavailability [18]. Over the last few decades, there have been major nanotechnological advances in the use of LNP medicine for gene and immunotherapy. In this article, we will focus on the development of LNPs through different nano-pharmaceutical techniques as well as on the strategies that may be employed to encapsulate bio-therapeutic drugs that enable gene therapies.",

                    "text": "The default accumulation site of LNPs is the liver, where they acquire apolipoprotein E (apoE) from the bloodstream, facilitating their uptake by hepatocytes through interaction with the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) [37,38]. Alternatively, LNPs can also be decorated with N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) ligands, which bind to the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) on hepatocytes, directing the nanoparticles through receptor-mediated endocytosis [37]. This dual approach maximizes therapeutic efficacy and minimizes off-target effects, offering a robust framework for liver-specific delivery of advanced LNP-based therapies. Nevertheless, commercial LNP formulations have primarily been used for intramuscular (IM) administration, such as in COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, targeting the liver. This narrow focus constrains their potential applications beyond livertargeted treatments. Targeting organs beyond the liver is critical due to the potential to enhance therapeutic efficacy for different diseases and reduce hepatic toxicity. LNPs can also concentrate therapeutic agents in targeted tissues by enabling organ-specific drug delivery. Siegwart et al. developed the Selective Organ Targeting (SORT) system, directing LNPs to the lung, spleen, and liver after intravenous (IV) administration [29] (Figure 2a). By introducing SORT molecules based on the four existing lipids mentioned above, the physicochemical properties of the nanoparticles are modulated. SORT molecules include cationic lipids for lung targeting, anionic lipids for spleen targeting, and ionizable amino lipids for liver targeting. These lipids interact with the traditional components, altering the nanoparticles' surface charge, hydrophobicity, and interaction with biological membranes. As a result, LNPs can engage with specific cellular receptors, promoting selective uptake by target cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis or enhanced membrane fusion. In recent advancements, they presented a gene editing approach based on the SORT system, achieving significant and long-lasting genome editing in lung stem cells after IV administrations [30].",

Wang, Yaopeng Ding, Kellie Chong, Meng Cui, Zeyu Cao, Chenjue Tang, Zhen Tian, Yuping Hu, Yu Zhao, Shaoyi Jiang\n## Abstract\nIntroduction: The advent of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) as a delivery platform for mRNA therapeutics has revolutionized the biomedical field, particularly in treating infectious diseases, cancer, genetic disorders, and metabolic diseases. Recent Advances in Therapeutic LNPs: LNPs, composed of ionizable lipids, phospholipids, cholesterol, and polyethylene glycol (PEG) lipids, facilitate efficient cellular uptake and cytosolic release of mRNA while mitigating degradation by nucleases. However, as synthetic entities, LNPs face challenges that alter their therapeutic efficacy and safety concerns. Toxicity/Reactogenicity/Immunogenicity: This review provides a comprehensive overview of the latest advancements in LNP research, focusing on preclinical safety assessments encompassing toxicity, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity. Summary and Outlook: Additionally, it outlines potential strategies for addressing these challenges and offers insights into future research directions for enhancing the application of LNPs in mRNA therapeutics.\n## Ionizable Lipids for Constructing Selective Organ-Targeting LNPs\nThe default accumulation site of LNPs is the liver, where they acquire apolipoprotein E (apoE) from the bloodstream, facilitating their uptake by hepatocytes through interaction with the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) [37,38]. Alternatively, LNPs can also be decorated with N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) ligands, which bind to the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) on hepatocytes, directing the nanoparticles through receptor-mediated endocytosis [37]. This dual approach maximizes therapeutic efficacy and minimizes off-target effects, offering a robust framework for liver-specific delivery of advanced LNP-based therapies. Nevertheless, commercial LNP formulations have primarily been used for intramuscular (IM) administration, such as in COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, targeting the liver. This narrow focus constrains their potential applications beyond livertargeted treatments. Targeting organs beyond the liver is critical due to the potential to enhance therapeutic efficacy for different diseases and reduce hepatic toxicity. LNPs can also concentrate therapeutic agents in targeted tissues by enabling organ-specific drug delivery. Siegwart et al. developed the Selective Organ Targeting (SORT) system, directing LNPs to the lung, spleen, and liver after intravenous (IV) administration [29] (Figure 2a). By introducing SORT molecules based on the four existing lipids mentioned above, the physicochemical properties of the nanoparticles are modulated. SORT molecules include cationic lipids for lung targeting, anionic lipids for spleen targeting, and ionizable amino lipids for liver targeting. These lipids interact with the traditional components, altering the nanoparticles' surface charge, hydrophobicity, and interaction with biological membranes. As a result, LNPs can engage with specific cellular receptors, promoting selective uptake by target cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis or enhanced membrane fusion. In recent advancements, they presented a gene editing approach based on the SORT system, achieving significant and long-lasting genome editing in lung stem cells after IV administrations [30].",

As systemic delivery platforms, these technologies are exemplified by Onpattro, an approved LNP\u2010based RNA interference therapy, administered intravenously and targeted to parenchymal liver cells. The discovery of systemically administered LNP technologies capable of preferential RNA delivery beyond hepatocytes has, however, proven more challenging.

Evaluated in embryonic zebrafish, validated in mice, and directly compared to LNP\u2013mRNA systems based on the lipid composition of Onpattro, RES\u2010targeted LNPs significantly enhance mRNA expression both globally within the liver and specifically within hepatic RES cell types. Hepatic RES targeting requires just a single lipid change within the formulation of Onpattro to switch LNP surface charge from neutral to anionic. This technology not only provides new opportunities to treat liver\u2010specific and systemic diseases in which RES cell types play a key role but, more importantly, exemplifies that rational design of advanced RNA therapies must be preceded by a robust understanding of the dominant nano\u2013biointeractions involved.\n## LNP-Mediated mRNA Delivery and Expression in Mice\nNext, we validated LNP biodistribution and LNP-mediated mRNA expression patterns in mice, focusing on cell-specific LNP distribution and mRNA expression within the murine liver, the largest RES organ in mammals.

Figure 2 shows a schematic overview of LNP uptake in the liver, demon-strating the journey of LNPs through the sinusoidal lumen, across LSECs and the Disse space, to hepatocytes, where receptor-mediated endocytosis occurs. The interactions of LNPs with other liver cell subtypes, such as CD74-expressing macrophages and CD32-expressing endothelial cells, affect how efficiently nucleic acids are delivered. 32 Table 1 summarizes these cell types and their interactions with LNPs. \n\nKupffer cells are distinct macrophages that reside in the liver sinusoids, are responsible for a large fraction of the body's total macrophages, and are involved in clearing circulating nanoparticles and other foreign materials from the blood. Kupffer cells rapidly take up LNPs, resulting in their predominant distribution in the liver after intravenous administration. 23,33 Alongside their phagocytic function, Kupffer cells have defined subpopulations with inflammatory (CD74High) and tolerogenic (CD74Low) phenotypes, 32 which can influence the immune response and nanoparticle clearance. Their high uptake often limits the amount of LNPs reaching hepatocytes, as Kupffer cells sequester the nanoparticles before they can reach their target cells, reducing functional delivery. 35  et al. 11 demonstrated that modulating Kupffer cell activity can enhance nanoparticle delivery to target tissues. Depletion of Kupffer cells has been shown to improve the functional delivery of nanoparticles to hepatocytes and improve therapeutic outcomes, especially in cancer models. 36 y strategies include: \n\n(1) Saturation of Kupffer cells using non-toxic materials to temporarily reduce their phagocytic capacity. \n\nDepletion of Kupffer cells to minimize liver sequestration and enhance nanoparticle circulation to target tissues.",

                    "text": "2][3][4] LNP technology has come a long way, starting with early liposomal drug systems and advancing to sophisticated formulations designed for precise nucleic acid delivery. [7][8][9] One key feature of LNPs is their preferential accumulation in the liver, a phenomenon that has been well exploited for treating liver disease. This liver-specific tropism depends on interactions with serum proteins (e.g., apolipoprotein E [ApoE]) as well as the liver's anatomy and physiology. 10,11 Upon systemic administration, LNPs rapidly bind to ApoE, which facilitates their targeting to hepatocytes via low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor. 12 As an additional driver of LNP accumulation, the liver's participation in the reticuloendothelial system (RES) is fundamental to ApoE-mediated targeting. 10 Kupffer cells, the liver's resident macrophages that filter nanoparticles from the bloodstream, contribute to liver tropism but can also reduce ther-apeutic efficacy by trapping LNPs before they reach hepatocytes. 13 To address this limitation, lipid compositions are optimized to evade macrophage uptake or to maximize delivery to hepatocytes. 14 e role of the RES in LNP biodistribution is exemplified by Wang et al., 15 who demonstrated how hard nanomaterials are sequestered in the liver through interactions with its microarchitecture and specific cellular components. They have shown that liver-resident Kupffer cells, B cells, and endothelial cells are responsible for nanomaterial accumulation, with Kupffer cells having the highest uptake. At the same time, nanomaterials enter the liver sinusoids at a slower flow rate than in systemic circulation, which increases their probability of uptake by these phagocytic cells, such as Kupffer cells. \n\nOnce inside hepatocytes, LNPs enable applications such as gene editing, gene expression, and gene silencing 16 (Figure 1), as previously reported. 17",

For liver-specific targeting, the addition of an ionizable cationic lipid, e.g., DODAP, has been shown to enhance liver accumulation. The SORT LNP mechanism uses serum protein adsorption, where proteins (e.g., ApoE) can bind to the nanoparticle surface and mediate uptake by target cells, such as hepatocytes via LDL receptors or through other tissue-specific pathways, depending on the recruited proteins. \n\nThe mechanism of tissue-specific targeting of SORT LNPs is illustrated in Figure 4. This proposed three-step consists of (1) desorption of PEG lipids from the nanoparticle surface, (2) binding of specific plasma proteins to the exposed SORT molecules, and (3) receptormediated uptake in target tissues. The figure shows how modifying the PEG-lipid properties (e.g., using less-sheddable PEG lipids like C18-PEG2K) significantly reduces targeting efficiency, as demonstrated by decreased bioluminescence in target organs. Additionally, the plasma protein binding profiles shown in the figure emphasize how the molecular structure of SORT molecules influences the protein corona composition and isoelectric point distribution, directly affecting organ-specific biodistribution. 65 SORT nanoparticles also can be designed to selectively edit therapeutically relevant cell types such as epithelial cells, endothelial cells, B cells, T cells, and hepatocytes, using various gene-editing modalities, e.g., mRNA, Cas9 mRNA/single guide RNA, and Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complexes. 66",

                    "text": "LNPs are effective in targeting the liver; however, to understand their localization, it is important to distinguish biodistribution from functional delivery. This distinction helps clarify how LNPs can target specific organs such as the liver while guaranteeing the therapeutic cargo is effectively delivered in the target cells. 32,52 Biodistribution is the process of LNPs accumulating in specific tissues after entering circulation, while functional delivery depends on the successful release and action of the therapeutic cargo (e.g., mRNA or small interfering RNA [siRNA]) in target cells. 53 This distinction is important because LNPs can accumulate in tissues such as the liver without producing intended therapeutic effects. \n\nFunctional delivery may be impaired by factors such as inadequate endosomal escape or protein corona, 54 which can drive LNP accumulation in non-target cells while hindering cellular uptake and effective intracellular delivery in target cells. Proteomic analyses have shown that the composition of the protein corona can affect nanoparticlecell interactions, altering both the distribution and efficacy of the delivery system by influencing receptor recognition and endocytosis mechanisms. 55 Functional delivery is also impacted by challenges in intracellular trafficking and cargo release once inside cells. [58] Several studies have demonstrated rapid liver accumulation of LNPs within minutes of administration, largely due to the liver's extensive blood flow and porous endothelium. 24,35,59 However, this high level of accumulation does not directly translate to efficient functional www.moleculartherapy.org Review delivery. Recent work by Lam et al. 60 showed that while LNPs of different sizes can accumulate similarly in the liver, their functional delivery to hepatocytes varies between species. In non-human primates, smaller LNPs (50-60 nm) showed approximately 5-fold higher protein expression in liver compared with conventional larger particles (70-80 nm). More importantly, both formulations exhibited similar pharmacokinetic profiles and liver accumulation. This finding demonstrates that the liver microarchitecture, for example, the size of liver fenestrae, which are smaller in primates than rodents, is important for efficient delivery. This result is further supported by Sato et al., 61 who showed that uptake mechanisms in hepatocytes vary based on ionizable lipid structure.",

The results showed that intravenous delivery is the most commonly used route, demonstrating its effectiveness in targeting liver cells. Key observations, listed below, show the influence of lipid components, surface chemistry, and target cell interactions. \n\n(1) Ionizable lipids contributed to increased endosomal escape and liver-specific delivery. Lipids, such as MC3 and cKK-E12, had specific pKa values optimized for hepatocyte uptake. 32,67 Importantly, tail length affected organ distribution. For example, shorter tails targeted the spleen, and longer tails favored liver uptake. 67 Formulations such as 5A2-SC8 and 3A5-SC14 showed different targeting behavior; e.g., 5A2-SC8 enhanced ApoEmediated hepatocyte delivery, while 3A5-SC14 favored Kupffer cell uptake. 36 2) Helper lipids, such as DOPE and DSPC, impacted biodistribution. For example, DOPE improved ApoE-mediated liver uptake, while DSPC directed transport to the spleen, showing how fine-tuning LNPs allowed for specific targeting. 23,24 3) Cholesterol stabilizes LNPs and also influences targeting. Esterified cholesterol improved endothelial delivery, while oxidized cholesterol favored Kupffer cells and immune cells, reducing hepatocyte interaction. 68,69 Cationic cholesterol further facilitated delivery to both the liver and extrahepatic tissues, e.g., the lungs and heart. 70 (4) Surface chemistry was important for targeting efficiency. PEG lipids improved circulation, while sheddable variants (e.g., pH-sensitive or enzymatically cleavable PEG) helped target the liver. Mannose-PEG, on the other hand, enhanced receptor-specific delivery to LSECs. 23 pH-sensitive PEGylated lipids increased the stability of the formulation and enabled efficient liver genome editing. 71 Siloxane-incorporated lipidoids also improved endosomal escape and liver-specific mRNA delivery. 72",

Understanding of biodistribution and liver-specific tropism\n# Venue: Molecular Therapy: Methods & Clinical Development\n# Authors: M. Hosseini-Kharat, K. Bremmell, C. Prestidge\n## Abstract\nNone\n## INTRODUCTION\n2][3][4] LNP technology has come a long way, starting with early liposomal drug systems and advancing to sophisticated formulations designed for precise nucleic acid delivery. [7][8][9] One key feature of LNPs is their preferential accumulation in the liver, a phenomenon that has been well exploited for treating liver disease. This liver-specific tropism depends on interactions with serum proteins (e.g., apolipoprotein E [ApoE]) as well as the liver's anatomy and physiology. 10,11 Upon systemic administration, LNPs rapidly bind to ApoE, which facilitates their targeting to hepatocytes via low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor. 12 As an additional driver of LNP accumulation, the liver's participation in the reticuloendothelial system (RES) is fundamental to ApoE-mediated targeting. 10 Kupffer cells, the liver's resident macrophages that filter nanoparticles from the bloodstream, contribute to liver tropism but can also reduce ther-apeutic efficacy by trapping LNPs before they reach hepatocytes. 13 To address this limitation, lipid compositions are optimized to evade macrophage uptake or to maximize delivery to hepatocytes. 14 e role of the RES in LNP biodistribution is exemplified by Wang et al., 15 who demonstrated how hard nanomaterials are sequestered in the liver through interactions with its microarchitecture and specific cellular components. They have shown that liver-resident Kupffer cells, B cells, and endothelial cells are responsible for nanomaterial accumulation, with Kupffer cells having the highest uptake. At the same time, nanomaterials enter the liver sinusoids at a slower flow rate than in systemic circulation, which increases their probability of uptake by these phagocytic cells, such as Kupffer cells. \n\nOnce inside hepatocytes, LNPs enable applications such as gene editing, gene expression, and gene silencing 16 (Figure 1), as previously reported. 17\n\n## INTERACTIONS BETWEEN LIVER CELL TYPES AND LNPs\nLiver cells help metabolism, immune surveillance, and nanoparticle processing. 9][30][31] Of particular importance, these cells interact with LNPs and influence their biodistribution and functional delivery. Figure 2 shows a schematic overview of LNP uptake in the liver, demon-strating the journey of LNPs through the sinusoidal lumen, across LSECs and the Disse space, to hepatocytes, where receptor-mediated endocytosis occurs. The interactions of LNPs with other liver cell subtypes, such as CD74-expressing macrophages and CD32-expressing endothelial cells, affect how efficiently nucleic acids are delivered. 32 Table 1 summarizes these cell types and their interactions with LNPs. \n\nKupffer cells are distinct macrophages that reside in the liver sinusoids, are responsible for a large fraction of the body's total macrophages, and are involved in clearing circulating nanoparticles and other foreign materials from the blood. Kupffer cells rapidly take up LNPs, resulting in their predominant distribution in the liver after intravenous administration. 23,33 Alongside their phagocytic function, Kupffer cells have defined subpopulations with inflammatory (CD74High) and tolerogenic (CD74Low) phenotypes, 32 which can influence the immune response and nanoparticle clearance. Their high uptake often limits the amount of LNPs reaching hepatocytes, as Kupffer cells sequester the nanoparticles before they can reach their target cells, reducing functional delivery. 35  et al. 11 demonstrated that modulating Kupffer cell activity can enhance nanoparticle delivery to target tissues. Depletion of Kupffer cells has been shown to improve the functional delivery of nanoparticles to hepatocytes and improve therapeutic outcomes, especially in cancer models. 36 y strategies include: \n\n(1) Saturation of Kupffer cells using non-toxic materials to temporarily reduce their phagocytic capacity. \n\nDepletion of Kupffer cells to minimize liver sequestration and enhance nanoparticle circulation to target tissues.\n\n## LNP COMPOSITION AND LIVER TARGETING\nLNPs are effective in targeting the liver; however, to understand their localization, it is important to distinguish biodistribution from functional delivery. This distinction helps clarify how LNPs can target specific organs such as the liver while guaranteeing the therapeutic cargo is effectively delivered in the target cells. 32,52 Biodistribution is the process of LNPs accumulating in specific tissues after entering circulation, while functional delivery depends on the successful release and action of the therapeutic cargo (e.g., mRNA or small interfering RNA [siRNA]) in target cells. 53 This distinction is important because LNPs can accumulate in tissues such as the liver without producing intended therapeutic effects. \n\nFunctional delivery may be impaired by factors such as inadequate endosomal escape or protein corona, 54 which can drive LNP accumulation in non-target cells while hindering cellular uptake and effective intracellular delivery in target cells. Proteomic analyses have shown that the composition of the protein corona can affect nanoparticlecell interactions, altering both the distribution and efficacy of the delivery system by influencing receptor recognition and endocytosis mechanisms. 55 Functional delivery is also impacted by challenges in intracellular trafficking and cargo release once inside cells. [58] Several studies have demonstrated rapid liver accumulation of LNPs within minutes of administration, largely due to the liver's extensive blood flow and porous endothelium. 24,35,59 However, this high level of accumulation does not directly translate to efficient functional www.moleculartherapy.org Review delivery. Recent work by Lam et al. 60 showed that while LNPs of different sizes can accumulate similarly in the liver, their functional delivery to hepatocytes varies between species. In non-human primates, smaller LNPs (50-60 nm) showed approximately 5-fold higher protein expression in liver compared with conventional larger particles (70-80 nm). More importantly, both formulations exhibited similar pharmacokinetic profiles and liver accumulation. This finding demonstrates that the liver microarchitecture, for example, the size of liver fenestrae, which are smaller in primates than rodents, is important for efficient delivery. This result is further supported by Sato et al., 61 who showed that uptake mechanisms in hepatocytes vary based on ionizable lipid structure.\n...\nIn contrast, more sterically hindered lipids, e.g., DLin-MC3-DMA and ALC-0315, exhibited slower degradation, resulting in prolonged liver retention. \n\nAnother example is the use of SORT nanoparticles to enhance targeted mRNA delivery to organs, such as the liver, spleen, and lungs. 65 y adding a fifth \"SORT molecule\" (e.g., 18PA for spleen targeting and DOTAP for lung targeting) to the conventional four-component LNP, modifications in chemical composition have been shown to affect biodistribution. For liver-specific targeting, the addition of an ionizable cationic lipid, e.g., DODAP, has been shown to enhance liver accumulation. The SORT LNP mechanism uses serum protein adsorption, where proteins (e.g., ApoE) can bind to the nanoparticle surface and mediate uptake by target cells, such as hepatocytes via LDL receptors or through other tissue-specific pathways, depending on the recruited proteins. \n\nThe mechanism of tissue-specific targeting of SORT LNPs is illustrated in Figure 4. This proposed three-step consists of (1) desorption of PEG lipids from the nanoparticle surface, (2) binding of specific plasma proteins to the exposed SORT molecules, and (3) receptormediated uptake in target tissues. The figure shows how modifying the PEG-lipid properties (e.g., using less-sheddable PEG lipids like C18-PEG2K) significantly reduces targeting efficiency, as demonstrated by decreased bioluminescence in target organs. Additionally, the plasma protein binding profiles shown in the figure emphasize how the molecular structure of SORT molecules influences the protein corona composition and isoelectric point distribution, directly affecting organ-specific biodistribution. 65 SORT nanoparticles also can be designed to selectively edit therapeutically relevant cell types such as epithelial cells, endothelial cells, B cells, T cells, and hepatocytes, using various gene-editing modalities, e.g., mRNA, Cas9 mRNA/single guide RNA, and Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complexes. 66\n\n## ANALYSIS OF LIVER-TARGETED LNP STUDIES\nKey examples from the literature on liver-targeting LNPs are summarized in Table 2. The results showed that intravenous delivery is the most commonly used route, demonstrating its effectiveness in targeting liver cells. Key observations, listed below, show the influence of lipid components, surface chemistry, and target cell interactions. \n\n(1) Ionizable lipids contributed to increased endosomal escape and liver-specific delivery. Lipids, such as MC3 and cKK-E12, had specific pKa values optimized for hepatocyte uptake. 32,67 Importantly, tail length affected organ distribution. For example, shorter tails targeted the spleen, and longer tails favored liver uptake. 67 Formulations such as 5A2-SC8 and 3A5-SC14 showed different targeting behavior; e.g., 5A2-SC8 enhanced ApoEmediated hepatocyte delivery, while 3A5-SC14 favored Kupffer cell uptake. 36 2) Helper lipids, such as DOPE and DSPC, impacted biodistribution. For example, DOPE improved ApoE-mediated liver uptake, while DSPC directed transport to the spleen, showing how fine-tuning LNPs allowed for specific targeting. 23,24 3) Cholesterol stabilizes LNPs and also influences targeting. Esterified cholesterol improved endothelial delivery, while oxidized cholesterol favored Kupffer cells and immune cells, reducing hepatocyte interaction. 68,69 Cationic cholesterol further facilitated delivery to both the liver and extrahepatic tissues, e.g., the lungs and heart. 70 (4) Surface chemistry was important for targeting efficiency. PEG lipids improved circulation, while sheddable variants (e.g., pH-sensitive or enzymatically cleavable PEG) helped target the liver. Mannose-PEG, on the other hand, enhanced receptor-specific delivery to LSECs. 23 pH-sensitive PEGylated lipids increased the stability of the formulation and enabled efficient liver genome editing. 71 Siloxane-incorporated lipidoids also improved endosomal escape and liver-specific mRNA delivery. 72",

A similar intrahepatic distribution has recently been described for LNP-DNA barcode systems (composed of MC3 or cKK-E12) by Sago et al. [50]. However, direct comparison of datasets carried out with different LNP systems, including variations in the lipid composition, ionizable lipid, lipid-nucleic acid ratios, and nucleic acid type must be assessed with caution. At a dose of 0.3 mg DNA /kg, LNPs accumulated in all three major liver cell types, with higher doses in Kupffer cells and hepatocytes than endothelial cells. In sharp contrast, gene expression following LNP-mediated mRNA delivery demonstrated an inverse hierarchy among hepatic cells: endothelial cells > Kupffer cells > hepatocytes. Higher LNP doses corresponding to 1 mg/kg mRNA shifted expression slightly towards hepatocytes while keeping the same pattern. Transfection of all major liver cell types with equal potency was recently demonstrated for LNP-mRNA systems (composed of branched-tail 306O i10 ) at a dose of 2 mg RNA/kg by Hajj et al. [51].\n\nIndeed, targeting the right cell type with the right dose is crucial to developing effective therapeutics.

                    "text": "A number of recent studies have demonstrated that LNP systems accumulate in various cell types within the liver [49,50,143,159]. Important physicochemical characteristics that modulate intrahepatic LNP distribution and activity are particle size, apparent pKa value (and resulting surface charge), and lipase sensitivity [159]. For clinical utility, it is also expected that these formulations display high entrapment efficiencies.\n\nA recent study by Chen et al. investigated how LNP size (30 nm -120 nm) influences gene silencing in hepatocytes [153]. A clear hierarchy in gene silencing potency was observed with LNP-siRNA systems around 80 nm exhibiting maximum activity (78 nm > 42 nm > 38 nm >> 27 nm > 117 nm). This LNP size optimum results from a combination of two factors: 1) smaller particles being less active (less stable and less fusogenic); and 2) larger particles (>100 nm), not being able to access hepatocytes (limited by fenestrations). Sato et al. verified these results demonstrating significant reduction in hepatocyte gene silencing for LNP-siRNA sizes above the average liver fenestrae diameters [159]. Interestingly, similar gene silencing activity in LSECs was observed for LNP-siRNA sizes up to 200 nm. This suggests that LNP sizes between 120 nm to 200 nm could be used for LSEC targeting.\n\nA key advance during the development of Onpattro\u00ae for hepatocyte gene silencing was identifying an optimized ionizable cationic lipid with an apparent pKa between 6.2 and 6.5 [17,31]. Further increasing the pKa value to 7.15 resulted in improved gene silencing in LSECs [159,160]. Incorporating ionizable cationic lipids exhibiting higher pKa values increased accumulation in the MPS, most likely due to scavenger receptor recognition [159].\n\nThe lipid sensitivity to phospholipase is another important factor modulating intrahepatic LNP distribution and activity.

First, we describe the liver's microanatomy and how its cell subtypes affect LNP accumulation and clearance. Second, we discuss design criteria and production methods [35,36] for intravenouslyadministered LNPs delivering nucleic acid therapeutics to the liver. Finally, we highlight the (pre)clinical development of LNP-based genetic drugs for treating genetic liver diseases, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and infections.\n\nOf note, readers are referred to several excellent reviews covering other clinically relevant liver-targeted nucleic acid therapeutics, such as ASOs [3], N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)-siRNA conjugates [4], or adenovirus-associated vectors [6,7].\n\n## Cell types within the liver microenvironment\ninjection, LNPs were mainly localized in the space of Disse, whereas 2 hours post injection LNPs accumulated in hepatocytes. siRNAs delivered to Kupffer cells and LSECs were inactive, but delivery to hepatocytes resulted in efficient gene silencing. A similar intrahepatic distribution has recently been described for LNP-DNA barcode systems (composed of MC3 or cKK-E12) by Sago et al. [50]. However, direct comparison of datasets carried out with different LNP systems, including variations in the lipid composition, ionizable lipid, lipid-nucleic acid ratios, and nucleic acid type must be assessed with caution. At a dose of 0.3 mg DNA /kg, LNPs accumulated in all three major liver cell types, with higher doses in Kupffer cells and hepatocytes than endothelial cells. In sharp contrast, gene expression following LNP-mediated mRNA delivery demonstrated an inverse hierarchy among hepatic cells: endothelial cells > Kupffer cells > hepatocytes. Higher LNP doses corresponding to 1 mg/kg mRNA shifted expression slightly towards hepatocytes while keeping the same pattern. Transfection of all major liver cell types with equal potency was recently demonstrated for LNP-mRNA systems (composed of branched-tail 306O i10 ) at a dose of 2 mg RNA/kg by Hajj et al. [51].\n\nIndeed, targeting the right cell type with the right dose is crucial to developing effective therapeutics. It should be noted that the LNP compositions described in these preclinical studies deviate from those used in the clinic (except for MC3-based LNPs). Systematic studies are therefore needed to improve our fundamental understanding of LNPs' in vivo behavior. Rigorous control of physicochemical LNP characteristics such as size distribution, zeta potential, and entrapment will be crucial to assess the intrahepatic distribution of a single LNP composition with different payloads.\n\n## Optimizing LNP characteristics\nA number of recent studies have demonstrated that LNP systems accumulate in various cell types within the liver [49,50,143,159]. Important physicochemical characteristics that modulate intrahepatic LNP distribution and activity are particle size, apparent pKa value (and resulting surface charge), and lipase sensitivity [159].

Ionizable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been widely used for in vivo delivery of RNA therapeutics into the liver. However, a main challenge remains to develop LNP formulations for selective delivery of RNA into certain types of liver cells, such as hepatocytes and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). Here, we report the engineered LNPs for the targeted delivery of RNA into hepatocytes and LSECs. The effects of particle size and polyethylene glycol\u2013lipid content in the LNPs were evaluated for the hepatocyte-specific delivery of mRNA by ApoE-mediated cellular uptake through low-density lipoprotein receptors. Targeted delivery of RNA to LSECs was further investigated using active ligands. Incorporation of mannose allowed the selective delivery of RNA to LSECs, while minimizing the unwanted cellular uptake by hepatocytes. These results demonstrate that engineered LNPs have great potential for the cell type\u2013specific delivery of RNA into the liver and other tissues.",

Since the major cell population in the liver is hepatocytes and they overexpress LDLR, an alternative targeting ligand is necessary for LSEC-specific delivery of RNA other than the ApoE. Previously, specific targeting ligands were evaluated for enhancing the selective delivery of LNPs to target cells (15). Kumar et al. (36) showed decreased activity of LNPs with higher PEG-lipid content in hepatocytes due to reduced association of ApoE with LNPs. They showed that LNPs with 5% PEG-lipid have a lower binding affinity with ApoE compared to LNPs with 1.5% PEG-lipid. By introducing unique targeting ligands to the highly PEGylated LNPs, ApoE-mediated cellular uptake can be blocked and selective delivery of LNPs can be achieved. \n\nAmong various liver cells, LSECs are substantial targets for RNA therapeutics because LSECs are closely related to fetal liver diseases resulting from LSECs-derived gene products (17,19).

Kim, M. Jeong, S. Hur, Y. Cho, J. Park, H. Jung, Y. Seo, H. Woo, K. Nam, K. Lee, H. Lee\n## Abstract\nEngineered ionizable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) were developed for the LSEC-specific delivery of RNA therapeutics. Ionizable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been widely used for in vivo delivery of RNA therapeutics into the liver. However, a main challenge remains to develop LNP formulations for selective delivery of RNA into certain types of liver cells, such as hepatocytes and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). Here, we report the engineered LNPs for the targeted delivery of RNA into hepatocytes and LSECs. The effects of particle size and polyethylene glycol\u2013lipid content in the LNPs were evaluated for the hepatocyte-specific delivery of mRNA by ApoE-mediated cellular uptake through low-density lipoprotein receptors. Targeted delivery of RNA to LSECs was further investigated using active ligands. Incorporation of mannose allowed the selective delivery of RNA to LSECs, while minimizing the unwanted cellular uptake by hepatocytes. These results demonstrate that engineered LNPs have great potential for the cell type\u2013specific delivery of RNA into the liver and other tissues.\n## Targeted delivery of mRNA-loaded LNPs to different types of liver cells by controlling their size and PEG-lipid content\nAfter establishing LNP delivery to hepatocytes, we examined the targeted delivery of mRNA-loaded LNPs to different types of liver cells by controlling their size and PEG-lipid content. Among these cells, we focused on LSECs, where many of liver-related diseases originated. First, we hypothesized that as LSECs reside in the liver blood wall, LNPs that cannot penetrate the fenestrae will be uptaken into the LSECs. We prepared various LNPs loaded with mCre, and their size was ranging from 50 to 100 nm by varying PEG-lipid (%) (Fig. 5, A and B). For a change in the mole ratio of PEG-lipid, the change must be replaced with the mole ratio of other components. Mole ratio of PEG-lipid was varied by expending that of cholesterol. We have chosen cholesterol because, first, cholesterol has the least effect on endosomal release compared to other lipids (35). Second, cholesterol accounts for a large mole ratio among the lipid compositions, so this small change only accounts for less than 10% of the original, which will have very little impact. LNPs with mCre (0.5 mg/kg) were intravenously injected into mice. Two-days after injection, the liver was extracted and tdTomato-positive cells were confirmed by histology evaluation and flow cytometry analysis. \n\nFigure 5C and fig. S9 (A to C) show that LNPs with 68 nm (1.5% PEG-lipid) exhibited potent tdTomato fluorescence in hepatocytes. Smaller LNPs with less than 100 nm in size could easily penetrate the fenestrae upon entering the liver blood vessel and showed maximum expression of tdTomato fluorescence in hepatocytes at PEG-lipid content of 1.5% with 60 nm in size. However, reduced tdTomato fluorescence throughout the liver cells was observed with LNP formulations with 3% PEG-lipid. The observed phenomenon of reduced tdTomato fluorescence in higher PEG-lipid content may be attributed to the reduced ApoE-mediated cellular uptake of LNPs (36).\n\n## Active targeting of LSECs using ligand-incorporated LNPs\nUpon entering the blood stream, nanoparticles rapidly absorb serum proteins on their surface. The effects of protein corona heavily control the biodistribution of nanoparticles. For some LNPs, ApoE adsorption is essential for the cellular uptake of LNPs. Akinc et al. (15) have described the role of ApoE in the in vivo uptake of LNPs by hepatocytes. They compared the uptake of LNPs by hepatocytes in wild-type and ApoE knockout mice. The activity of LNPs was remarkably reduced in ApoE knockout (ApoE \u2212/\u2212 ) mice compared to wild-type mice. Since the major cell population in the liver is hepatocytes and they overexpress LDLR, an alternative targeting ligand is necessary for LSEC-specific delivery of RNA other than the ApoE. Previously, specific targeting ligands were evaluated for enhancing the selective delivery of LNPs to target cells (15). Kumar et al. (36) showed decreased activity of LNPs with higher PEG-lipid content in hepatocytes due to reduced association of ApoE with LNPs. They showed that LNPs with 5% PEG-lipid have a lower binding affinity with ApoE compared to LNPs with 1.5% PEG-lipid. By introducing unique targeting ligands to the highly PEGylated LNPs, ApoE-mediated cellular uptake can be blocked and selective delivery of LNPs can be achieved. \n\nAmong various liver cells, LSECs are substantial targets for RNA therapeutics because LSECs are closely related to fetal liver diseases resulting from LSECs-derived gene products (17,19). To achieve the selective delivery of LNPs to LSECs, we introduced LSEC-specific ligands to highly PEGylated LNPs. Mannose receptor is one of the receptors that specifically expressed on human and mice LSECs (17). Mannose-conjugated nanoparticles have been investigated in various targeted delivery studies, and these nanoparticles have been proven to be safe (37,38).",

            "abstract": "RNAi (RNA interference)-based technology is emerging as a versatile tool which has been widely utilized in the treatment of various diseases. siRNA can alter gene expression by binding to the target mRNA and thereby inhibiting its translation. This remarkable potential of siRNA makes it a useful candidate, and it has been successively used in the treatment of diseases, including cancer. However, certain properties of siRNA such as its large size and susceptibility to degradation by RNases are major drawbacks of using this technology at the broader scale. To overcome these challenges, there is a requirement for versatile tools for safe and efficient delivery of siRNA to its target site. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been extensively explored to this end, and this paper reviews different types of LNPs, namely liposomes, solid lipid NPs, nanostructured lipid carriers, and nanoemulsions, to highlight this delivery mode. The materials and methods of preparation of the LNPs have been described here, and pertinent physicochemical properties such as particle size, surface charge, surface modifications, and PEGylation in enhancing the delivery performance (stability and specificity) have been summarized. We have discussed in detail various challenges facing LNPs and various strategies to overcome biological barriers to undertake the safe delivery of siRNA to a target site. We additionally highlighted representative therapeutic applications of LNP formulations with siRNA that may offer unique therapeutic benefits in such wide areas as acute myeloid leukaemia, breast cancer, liver disease, hepatitis B and COVID-19 as recent examples.",

Another approach examined by Saunders et al. involved the pre-treatment of mice with a liposome that occupies liver cells temporarily prior to LNP delivery; this approach reduced the uptake of tested LNP-RNA A potential strategy for non-hepatocyte delivery is to deviate from ApoE-dependent pathways of delivery by increasing the PEG-lipid content in LNPs, which was not successful in terms of prolonged circulation and redirection to extrahepatic targets [119]. Conjugation of targeting ligands on the LNPs surface proved to be effective in facilitating the uptake by specific organs in small-scale settings. For instance, conjugated antibodies targeted against vascular cell adhesion molecules VCAM-1 or PECAM-1 and CD-4 were employed to redistribute the LNPs from liver to lung, cerebral endothelium during brain oedema and in all T cells (na\u00efve, memory, central, and effector) in both lymph and spleen, respectively [120]. Moreover, successful localization of LNP-siRNAs to the antigen-presenting cells' cytoplasm has been reported [121]. Another approach examined by Saunders et al. involved the pre-treatment of mice with a liposome that occupies liver cells temporarily prior to LNP delivery; this approach reduced the uptake of tested LNP-RNA formulations by the RES and ultimately led to enhanced bioavailability of the bioactive RNA, increasing the protein production for mRNA and better silencing for siRNA [105].",

Pandey, H. Uluda\u01e7\n## Abstract\nRNAi (RNA interference)-based technology is emerging as a versatile tool which has been widely utilized in the treatment of various diseases. siRNA can alter gene expression by binding to the target mRNA and thereby inhibiting its translation. This remarkable potential of siRNA makes it a useful candidate, and it has been successively used in the treatment of diseases, including cancer. However, certain properties of siRNA such as its large size and susceptibility to degradation by RNases are major drawbacks of using this technology at the broader scale. To overcome these challenges, there is a requirement for versatile tools for safe and efficient delivery of siRNA to its target site. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been extensively explored to this end, and this paper reviews different types of LNPs, namely liposomes, solid lipid NPs, nanostructured lipid carriers, and nanoemulsions, to highlight this delivery mode. The materials and methods of preparation of the LNPs have been described here, and pertinent physicochemical properties such as particle size, surface charge, surface modifications, and PEGylation in enhancing the delivery performance (stability and specificity) have been summarized. We have discussed in detail various challenges facing LNPs and various strategies to overcome biological barriers to undertake the safe delivery of siRNA to a target site. We additionally highlighted representative therapeutic applications of LNP formulations with siRNA that may offer unique therapeutic benefits in such wide areas as acute myeloid leukaemia, breast cancer, liver disease, hepatitis B and COVID-19 as recent examples.\n## Liver Accumulation\nMoreover, successful localization of LNP-siRNAs to the antigen-presenting cells' cytoplasm has been reported [121]. Another approach examined by Saunders et al. involved the pre-treatment of mice with a liposome that occupies liver cells temporarily prior to LNP delivery; this approach reduced the uptake of tested LNP-RNA A potential strategy for non-hepatocyte delivery is to deviate from ApoE-dependent pathways of delivery by increasing the PEG-lipid content in LNPs, which was not successful in terms of prolonged circulation and redirection to extrahepatic targets [119]. Conjugation of targeting ligands on the LNPs surface proved to be effective in facilitating the uptake by specific organs in small-scale settings. For instance, conjugated antibodies targeted against vascular cell adhesion molecules VCAM-1 or PECAM-1 and CD-4 were employed to redistribute the LNPs from liver to lung, cerebral endothelium during brain oedema and in all T cells (na\u00efve, memory, central, and effector) in both lymph and spleen, respectively [120]. Moreover, successful localization of LNP-siRNAs to the antigen-presenting cells' cytoplasm has been reported [121]. Another approach examined by Saunders et al. involved the pre-treatment of mice with a liposome that occupies liver cells temporarily prior to LNP delivery; this approach reduced the uptake of tested LNP-RNA formulations by the RES and ultimately led to enhanced bioavailability of the bioactive RNA, increasing the protein production for mRNA and better silencing for siRNA [105].",

To avoid non-specific tissue uptake of LNP during circulation, polyethylene glycol (PEG)-lipids were usually modified on the surface of LNP complex. The PEG lipids will gradually dissociate during blood circulation, i.e., shedding from the LNP, which mitigate its negative effects to the interaction between LNP and membrane of targeting cells 57 . In the liver targeted LNP-based drug, like Patisiran (the first siRNA-loaded LNP therapeutic being approved by FDA in 2018) 58 , the removal of PEG lipid enhanced LNP absorption on endogenous Apolipoprotein E (ApoE). LNPs accumulated in the liver along the blood circulation are taken up by hepatocytes, which are mediated by ApoE receptors on the hepatocytes surface. After its endocytosis by targeting cells, the pH changes in vesicles leads to the release of nucleotides 59 . \n\nBased on this mechanism, some lncRNAs targeting siRNA delivered by LNP were also developed since the clinical success of Patisiran. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), Connorty et al. 60 identified lncRNA LINC01257 as having an oncogenic role by promoting the proliferation of leukemia. By mixing siRNA with a lipid mixture (D-Lin-MC3, DSPC, cholesterol, DMG-PEG, DOPE-Rho), they targeted LINC01257 in AML cells by NxGen microfluidics systems (Fig. 6). The si-LINC01257-LNP effectively inhibits the proliferation of AML cells and reduces the off-target effects to the peripheral blood mononuclear cells.",

To avoid non-specific tissue uptake of LNP during circulation, polyethylene glycol (PEG)-lipids were usually modified on the surface of LNP complex. The PEG lipids will gradually dissociate during blood circulation, i.e., shedding from the LNP, which mitigate its negative effects to the interaction between LNP and membrane of targeting cells 57 . In the liver targeted LNP-based drug, like Patisiran (the first siRNA-loaded LNP therapeutic being approved by FDA in 2018) 58 , the removal of PEG lipid enhanced LNP absorption on endogenous Apolipoprotein E (ApoE).

Base editing, recognized as an exceptionally precise genetic modification tool, is emerging as a focus in the realm of genetic disease therapy. We provide a comprehensive overview of the fundamental principles and delivery methods of cytosine base editors (CBE), adenine base editors (ABE), and RNA base editors, with a particular focus on their applications and recent research advances in the treatment of genetic diseases. We have also explored the potential challenges faced by base editing technology in treatment, including aspects such as targeting specificity, safety, and efficacy, and have enumerated a series of possible solutions to propel the clinical translation of base editing technology. In conclusion, this article not only underscores the present state of base editing technology but also envisions its tremendous potential in the future, providing a novel perspective on the treatment of genetic diseases. It underscores the vast potential of base editing technology in the realm of genetic medicine, providing support for the progression of gene medicine and the development of innovative approaches to genetic disease therapy.",

                    "text": "In the field of gene editing, the application of nanoparticles has opened new avenues for precise interventions in complex biological systems. These tiny engineered materials can effectively encapsulate and protect gene editing tools, enabling their safe delivery to target  (Jeong et al., 2023). These components collectively enable LNPs to effectively transport biologically active substances like nucleic acids and proteins into cells. The intracellular delivery efficiency of LNPs can be finely tuned through rational design and modification, by altering aspects such as lipid composition, particle size, and surface characteristics (Paunovska et al., 2022;Wang et al., 2023b). The key advantages of LNPs include their extremely small particle size, high stability, and biocompatibility, which enable effective drug protection and delivery efficiency. One of the characteristics of conventional LNPs is their resemblance to low-density lipoprotein (LDL), which leads to their recognition and uptake by LDL receptors predominantly present in liver cells (Raguram et al., 2022). This results in the accumulation of LNPs in the liver, posing a limitation for their use in targeting non-hepatic tissues or organs. To overcome this challenge and expand the utility of LNPs beyond hepatic applications, researchers have been developing various innovative strategies. One such approach involves localized LNP injections, where Palanki and colleagues have successfully identified the most effective LNPs in the perinatal mouse brain by administering intracerebroventricular (ICV) injections in fetal and neonatal mice (Palanki et al., 2023). Another strategy is the use of DNA barcoding to identify non-hepatic cell-tropic LNPs (Dahlman et al., 2017;Ni et al., 2022). This method leverages unique DNA barcodes to modify distinct LNPs, resulting in a highly selective and efficient nanodelivery system targeted towards specific cells or tissues. Targeted modification of LNPs to achieve redirection is also a promising approach.",

Base editing, recognized as an exceptionally precise genetic modification tool, is emerging as a focus in the realm of genetic disease therapy. We provide a comprehensive overview of the fundamental principles and delivery methods of cytosine base editors (CBE), adenine base editors (ABE), and RNA base editors, with a particular focus on their applications and recent research advances in the treatment of genetic diseases. We have also explored the potential challenges faced by base editing technology in treatment, including aspects such as targeting specificity, safety, and efficacy, and have enumerated a series of possible solutions to propel the clinical translation of base editing technology. In conclusion, this article not only underscores the present state of base editing technology but also envisions its tremendous potential in the future, providing a novel perspective on the treatment of genetic diseases. It underscores the vast potential of base editing technology in the realm of genetic medicine, providing support for the progression of gene medicine and the development of innovative approaches to genetic disease therapy.\n## Nanoparticle delivery methods\nIn the field of gene editing, the application of nanoparticles has opened new avenues for precise interventions in complex biological systems. These tiny engineered materials can effectively encapsulate and protect gene editing tools, enabling their safe delivery to target  (Jeong et al., 2023). These components collectively enable LNPs to effectively transport biologically active substances like nucleic acids and proteins into cells. The intracellular delivery efficiency of LNPs can be finely tuned through rational design and modification, by altering aspects such as lipid composition, particle size, and surface characteristics (Paunovska et al., 2022;Wang et al., 2023b). The key advantages of LNPs include their extremely small particle size, high stability, and biocompatibility, which enable effective drug protection and delivery efficiency. One of the characteristics of conventional LNPs is their resemblance to low-density lipoprotein (LDL), which leads to their recognition and uptake by LDL receptors predominantly present in liver cells (Raguram et al., 2022). This results in the accumulation of LNPs in the liver, posing a limitation for their use in targeting non-hepatic tissues or organs. To overcome this challenge and expand the utility of LNPs beyond hepatic applications, researchers have been developing various innovative strategies. One such approach involves localized LNP injections, where Palanki and colleagues have successfully identified the most effective LNPs in the perinatal mouse brain by administering intracerebroventricular (ICV) injections in fetal and neonatal mice (Palanki et al., 2023). Another strategy is the use of DNA barcoding to identify non-hepatic cell-tropic LNPs (Dahlman et al., 2017;Ni et al., 2022). This method leverages unique DNA barcodes to modify distinct LNPs, resulting in a highly selective and efficient nanodelivery system targeted towards specific cells or tissues. Targeted modification of LNPs to achieve redirection is also a promising approach.",

Hepatocytes comprise most of the liver, which also contains Kupffer cells and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). The liver is the main organ to take up synthetic nanoparticles administered systemically. Studies including [63] have shown that preference for hepatocytes over the reticuloendothelial system (RES), which includes Kupffer cells and LSECs, can be tuned by making LNP sizes either smaller or larger than the diameter of the fenestrations in the liver (50-300 nm [104] and 107 \u00b1 1.5 nm [57]). Kim et al. [105] show that grafting mannose onto LNPs allowed for selective delivery of RNA to LSECs while minimizing unwanted cellular uptake by hepatocytes. Interestingly, Saunders et al. [106] exploited the dimensions of the fenestrations in the liver, in an alternate way, to increase LNP accumulation in cells other than the Kupffer cells and LSECs that usually take up a significant portion of nanoparticles administered systemically [107]. Specifically, Saunders et al. [106] administered non-toxic liposomes, termed nanoprimers, that were larger than the fenestrae of the liver capillaries and designed to transiently occupy RES cells in the liver prior to LNP administration. This strategy improved LNP nucleic acid-mediated knockdown and translation efficiency of targets in hepatocytes.",

Kulkarni, D. Witzigmann, Marianne Lind, K. Petersson, J. Simonsen\n## Abstract\nNone\n## Liver targeting\nThe most successful liver-targeting LNPs is likely Onpattro \u00d2 , which was designed to exploit apoE binding to LNP in circulation to deliver siRNA to hepatocytes via the LDLR receptor. Hepatocytes comprise most of the liver, which also contains Kupffer cells and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). The liver is the main organ to take up synthetic nanoparticles administered systemically. Studies including [63] have shown that preference for hepatocytes over the reticuloendothelial system (RES), which includes Kupffer cells and LSECs, can be tuned by making LNP sizes either smaller or larger than the diameter of the fenestrations in the liver (50-300 nm [104] and 107 \u00b1 1.5 nm [57]). Kim et al. [105] show that grafting mannose onto LNPs allowed for selective delivery of RNA to LSECs while minimizing unwanted cellular uptake by hepatocytes. Interestingly, Saunders et al. [106] exploited the dimensions of the fenestrations in the liver, in an alternate way, to increase LNP accumulation in cells other than the Kupffer cells and LSECs that usually take up a significant portion of nanoparticles administered systemically [107]. Specifically, Saunders et al. [106] administered non-toxic liposomes, termed nanoprimers, that were larger than the fenestrae of the liver capillaries and designed to transiently occupy RES cells in the liver prior to LNP administration. This strategy improved LNP nucleic acid-mediated knockdown and translation efficiency of targets in hepatocytes.",

It is achieved by BMS-986 263, a lipid nanoparticle delivering small interfering RNA targeting HSP47 [69]. LNP-siRNA system also efficiently delivers genetic materials into hepatocytes to treat hereditary transthyretin-mediated (hATTR) amyloidosis [70] upon systemic administration and other diseases. \n\n(Reviewed in Ref [71]) LNP also delivers siRNA into hepatocytes to attenuate steatosis in vivo. For instance, the LNP LUNAR\u00d2 particles encapsulated with siRNA for lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) potently silence LBP in hepatocyte and attenuate lipogenesis-induced liver lipid accumulation in MCD-induced NASH model. The ATX lipid inside contains amino head group and is protonated under acidic conditions, thereby interacting with the negatively charged siRNA to form stable complex to cross the plasma membrane. The ATX lipid-siRNA interaction is disrupted in endosome and releases the siRNA cargo into cytoplasm to silence LBP [72]. [47] and cancer cell [48] Furthermore, LNP also is capable of delivering mRNA into hepatocytes to overexpress target genes in situ to ameliorate NASH and NAFLD. \n\nAlthough at late stage of NAFLD and NASH, the hepatocytes are featured with necrosis and ballooning, injection of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) mRNA-LNP virtually transfected all hepatocytes in NAFLD mouse model, reversing the steatosis. Meanwhile, the liver function was restored with ALT level rapidly returning to normal baseline [73].",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles. The delivery approach that is both most widely used and most clinically advanced is to complex anionic oligonucleotides with cationic lipids thus forming lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) (161)(162)(163). This approach has been especially important for therapeutic use of siRNA (164) and good accounts of current clinical trials using siRNA LNPs are found in recent reviews (10,165). In addition to the cationic lipid, LNPs typically include a neutral lipid such as cholesterol, but a variety of compositions are possible. While simple LNPs are effective as cell culture transfection agents, they cannot be used in vivo because extensive interactions with opsonic proteins in blood lead to rapid clearance by RES phagocytes. LNPs for in vivo use are usually 100-200 nm in size and include a surface coating of a neutral polymer such as PEG to minimize protein binding and uptake by RES cells. This allows greater persistence in the circulation and the opportunity to interact with other cell types. However, because of their size, LNPs can only exit the circulation at sites where the endothelial barrier is fenestrated, particularly liver, spleen and certain tumors having a high EPR effect. Because of this, much of the work with siRNA-LNPs has focused on liver diseases including transthyrethrin-mediated amyloidosis, clotting disorders, liver cancer and disorders of lipid metabolism (11,166). \n\nThe action of LNPs involves initial uptake by endocytosis. In some cases this is mediated by the binding of apolipoprotein E and interaction with the LDL receptor (167). Once in endosomes, the cationic lipids of the LNP interact with anionic membrane lipids to disrupt membrane structure through the formation of a non-bilayer lipid phase termed inverted hexagonal (H II ). This leads both to increased membrane permeability and to dissolution of the LNP and is the basis for conveying the oligonucleotide to the cytosol (168).",

LNPs are clinically proven and the most widely used carriers for delivering oligonucleotide drugs. Composed of four components-ionizable cationic lipids, cholesterol, phospholipids, and polyethylene glycol (PEG)-modified lipids-LNPs form electrostatic bonds with negatively charged nucleic acids [34,47]. However, one major limitation of LNP delivery is their tendency to accumulate in the liver [48]. To improve the intratumoral accumulation of siRNA-loaded LNPs, LNPs were functionalized with the peptide tLyp-1 (truncated Lyp-1) to target pancreatic cancer cells. When injected intravenously into mice bearing pancreatic tumors, the treatment using LNPs in combination with gemcitabine resulted in reduced tumor size and the downregulation of KRAS and phospho-ERK [40]. This highlights that the application of LNPs is not limited to liver-associated diseases and immunotherapy but is viable for developing siRNA-based therapies for KRAS mutant tumors [49]. \n\nFurthermore, various platforms for siKRAS delivery systems have been tested in preclinical settings, including cRGD peptide-modified bioresponsive chimeric polymersomes and aerosol inhalation nanoparticles (siKRAS@GCLPP NP) [50,51].",

This paradigm shift is exemplified by the finding that cholesterol removal can address the persistent challenge of preventing nanoparticle accumulation in hepatic tissues, which can be explained by tuning the affinity to reduced lipoprotein adsorption 88 . By modulating and simplifying intrinsic LNPs components, researchers have achieved concurrent mRNA accumulation and translation in targeted organs like the lung and liver. This innovative targeting strategy shows promise for enhancing the precision of mRNA therapies across diverse diseases and may apply to existing LBNPs systems. However, it is important to note that the optimal LNPs formulation likely depends on the specific therapeutic target and delivery requirements, and traditional components may still play crucial roles in various applications. These advancements collectively represent a significant step forward in the development of more precisely targeted and efficient mRNA delivery systems, potentially expanding the therapeutic potential of mRNA-based treatments.",

Modification of the LNP surface with targeting ligands cou potentially improve LNP uptake beyond the liver. Here we show that targeting the VLA 4 receptor using the LDV motif on the surface of LNPs improved the cellular uptake LNPs in HSPCs ex vivo and in vivo. These combined data thereby provide evidence fo the use of LDV-LNPs for the treatment of hematological disorders. \n\nHigh liver accumulation is commonly reported for both liposomes and LNP-base therapies. Both LNPs, targeting and non-targeting, used in this study displayed a sho circulation time of 45 min. However, longer circulation times are desired as this will im prove the passive accumulation of LNPs in extrahepatic tissues [48]. The circulation tim is dictated by the lipid components of the nanoparticle formulation and can be finetune by modifying the length of the PEG-lipid chain, as longer lipid chains will increase th circulation time [49,50]. Since longer circulation times of PEG usually result in reduce endosomal release and will also increase the chances of evoking an anti-PEG immune r sponse [51], PEG does not seem to possess ideal characteristics for being incorporated These results clearly show that LDV-LNPs associate with both VLA-4-positive immature and mature HSPCs resulting in higher LNP accumulation and longer retention in the bone marrow.

Here we investigate the properties of LNP mRNA systems containing high proportions of bilayer forming lipids, using equimolar egg sphingomyelin and cholesterol as the bilayer-forming components. We show that LNP mRNA systems prepared at bilayer lipid to ionizable lipid molar ratios of 4-0.67 exhibit high mRNA encapsulation efficiencies (90-100%) and excellent transfection potencies in vitro. Systems with bilayer lipid to ionizable lipid molar ratios equating to 4 exhibit a liposomal morphology with a solid core suspended in an aqueous interior surrounded by a lipid bilayer. These liposomal LNPs exhibit longer circulation lifetimes than LNP systems with Onpattro-like lipid compositions and have enhanced extrahepatic transfection properties. The prolonged blood circulation lifetime is attributed to reduced plasma protein adsorption. The transfection competency of liposomal LNP systems is attributed to export of the solid core containing mRNA from the LNP as the endosomal pH is lowered. \n\nStandard lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulations, such as the clinically approved Onpattro LNP-siRNA formulation that can effectively transfect hepatocytes following intravenous (i.v.) administration 1,2 , have a lipid composition consisting of ionizable lipid/helper lipid/cholesterol/PEG-lipid in the approximate molar ratios 50:10:38.5:1.5. (This lipid composition is referred to as the Onpattro-like formulation in this study). These formulations exhibit a nanostructured core surrounded, at least in part, by a lipid monolayer 3 . ~90% of the injected dose of LNP systems with this lipid composition is cleared to the liver within an hour of i.v. administration 4 . While these formulations have shown considerable utility for vaccine and liver applications, their wider use for gene therapy is hindered by limited access to extrahepatic tissues.",

Three different lipases have been described including the lipoprotein and endothelial lipase in LSECs and the hepatic lipase in hepatocytes [161]. LNP-siRNA systems that incorporate ionizable cationic lipids that are sensitive to endothelial lipase (e.g. ester linkages between head and tail functions) have enhanced gene silencing in hepatocytes but exhibit significantly reduced activity in LSECs [159]. Co-treatment with lipase inhibitors or incorporating lipase-resistant ionizable cationic lipids can recover gene silencing in LSECs [159].\n\nBased on microanatomical, subcellular, and (patho)physiological considerations, an ideal LNP for gene regulation in hepatocytes must satisfy the following design criteria: nanoparticle size < 80 nm to efficiently pass through liver fenestrae and improve LNP stability, apparent ionizable cationic lipid pKa value around 6.4, near neutral surface charge to prevent sequestration by the MPS, and lack of immune stimulation and toxic effects. Achieving these and other criteria facilitating efficient nucleic acid entrapment and LNP formulation are detailed in the following section.\n\nIt is important to mention that upon intravenous administration LNPs adsorb serum proteins on their surface. Many, if not all, of the abovementioned physiochemical characteristics impart distinct properties to the LNPs which ultimately influence protein adsorption. This \"biomolecular corona\" covering nanoparticles significantly impacts systemic circulation and nano-bio interactions [162][163][164]. Efficient targeting and gene regulation in hepatocytes stems from the presence of ApoE in the corona of LNPs and enabled the success of Onpattro\u00ae [33,76].

            "text": "The final LNP component, the PEG-lipid, is engineered to perform two specific functions. First, PEG-lipids incorporate into the emerging nanoparticle during LNP formation. As LNP systems do not contain an aqueous core, PEG-lipids reside almost exclusively on the LNP surface, and their concentrations control particle size [146]. Both the PEG molecular weight as well as the molar percentage of PEG-lipid affect the characteristics of lipid-based particles [147][148][149]. Specifically, as the PEG-lipid is increased from 0.25 mol% to 5 mol%, a reduction in LNP size is observed from~120 nm to 25 nm, but further increases to PEG-content do not modify particle size [24,147]. Second, they improve the shelf-stability by creating a steric barrier that extends away from the surface of the LNP, thereby preventing particle aggregation and improving in vivo circulation lifetimes. However, for transfection purposes, PEG-lipids have an established inhibitory effect [150,151]. Based on the hypothesized mechanism of LNP function, the nanoparticle requires an intricate balance between stability in storage and circulation, and instability within the cell to support intracellular delivery [152]. Diffusible PEG-lipids helped stabilize particles while enabling intracellular delivery [25,151]. These lipids are composed of acyl chains that are 14-carbons in length and can dissociate rapidly from the LNP in the circulation [153]. Two hours post administration, only 20% of the injected PEG-lipid is associated with the LNP. In contrast, PEG-lipids with 18-carbon acyl chains, incorporate into the LNP and do not dissociate from the particle in the circulation. At high concentrations, these PEG-lipids can contribute to extending circulation half-life (from < 30 minutes for diffusible PEG-lipid to > 2 hours) [23,153]. However, LNPs designed to target hepatic disorders do not require a prolonged circulation lifetime due to the liver's natural ability to sequester nanoparticles. Therefore, diffusible PEG-lipids are ideal for such",

            "text": "The most established form of nanodelivery agents are lipidbased (Langer and Folkman, 1976;Adams et al., 2017). Lipid-based nanoparticles (LNPs) have been approved by the FDA for delivery of siRNA to the liver and for mRNA vaccine delivery (Paunovska et al., 2022). LNPs are based on structures that can be formed by phospholipids in aqueous solutions, such as micelles and liposomes (Paunovska et al., 2022). Traditional LNPs contain multiple lipids, including cationic lipids, amphipathic phospholipids, and poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG), as well as cholesterol (Semple et al., 2010;Cheng et al., 2015;Paunovska et al., 2022). Variations of these components can be used to direct LNP uptake to specific vascular beds (Paunovska et al., 2018). LNPs can be used to deliver a range of RNA payloads from siRNA to mRNA (Musunuru et al., 2021;Rothgangl et al., 2021). Because systemic delivery of RNA often leads to accumulation in the liver (Li et al., 2020), various strategies have been developed to target other organs, including the lung. One strategy has been to covalently conjugate an antibody that binds plasmalemma vesicleassociated protein (PV1) to LNPs. This strategy can increase the protein expression of mRNA delivered via these antibodyconjugated LNPs by 40-fold in the lung (Li et al., 2020). Nanoparticle size is an important factor in lung localization, with 160 nm conjugated LNPs leading to greater protein expression in the lungs compared to smaller 70 nm particles (Anselmo et al., 2015;Li et al., 2020).",

            "text": "LNPs can escape from the injection site, enter the systemic circulation, and accumulate in the liver even after administration via local injection routes such as intramuscular and intratumoral injection, thus limiting the localized site-specific protein expression [13,14]. Unwanted liver accumulation of mRNA-loaded LNPs can be minimized by reticuloendothelial-systemblockade strategies such as stealth coating of liver sinusoids using two-arm-PEG-Oligo(l-Lysine). These RES-blockade strategies improved selective organ targeting of nucleic acid therapeutics by dramatically decreasing accumulation in the liver [15]. Another significant hurdle to the widespread utility of LNPs is their indispensable component: ionizable lipids. These lipids are not only highly inflammatory but also generate electrophilic impurities. These impurities can give rise to reactive moieties, including reactive oxygenated species, which can hydrolyze tertiary amines, rendering the mRNA untranslatable and leading to a loss of protein expression [16,17]. Moreover, delivering LNPs to targeted organs is often challenging due to obstacles like the blood-brain barrier and the immune system. Addressing the immune response triggered by LNPs remains a significant challenge. Stealth coatings and immunomodulators can help mitigate this issue. Nanotechnology is a multidisciplinary science that uses fundamental aspects of physics, chemistry, and mathematics to design and manipulate atoms and molecules at the nanoscale to produce structures 1-1000 nm in size. Because of their small size and high surface area, the use of nanoparticles has resulted in improved drug solubility and enhanced bioavailability [18]. Over the last few decades, there have been major nanotechnological advances in the use of LNP medicine for gene and immunotherapy. In this article, we will focus on the development of LNPs through different nano-pharmaceutical techniques as well as on the strategies that may be employed to encapsulate bio-therapeutic drugs that enable gene therapies.",

            "text": "Although reducing hepatic uptake of parenterally administered LNP has been a challenge, alterations in LNP composition and physicochemical characteristics have been shown to influence liver distribution (Table 1). The LNP surface charge has been shown to influence the liver accumulation of intramuscularly administered LNP, with negatively charged LNP having greater liver uptake [4]. Similarly, the inclusion of neutral lipids to LNP resulted in liver tropism following intravenous injection, while the addition of cationic lipids to net neutral LNP resulted in a shift to lung uptake and the addition of negatively charged lipids to net neutral LNP resulted in splenic uptake [17]. The addition of oxidized cholesterol to LNP shifted liver uptake away from hepatocytes and into the hepatic microenvironment, including Kupffer cells and hepatic endothelial cells [30]. The inclusion of constrained lipids in LNP, such as adamantyl phospholipids, has also been shown to target hepatic Kupffer cells [31]. Apart from charge and composition, size can also influence hepatocyte transfection, presumably due to the hepatic architecture, with narrow sinusoidal fenestration pores of ~100 nm [32]; LNP > ~200 nm dramatically diminishes hepatocyte transfection [33]. \n\nAlternatives to LNP modification have also been attempted to prevent liver accumulation. In one example, a liposome termed a \"nanoprimer\" was used to saturate Kupffer cell-mediated clearance 10 min prior to administration of LNP containing Cy5.5 labeled human erythropoietin mRNA or factor VII siRNA, resulting in increased systemic fluorescence at 1 h post-dose and increased erythropoietin or decreased factor VII protein expression at 48 h post-dose, respectively [34]. Clever mRNA modifications have also been made in an attempt to reduce off-target liver expression by the design of hepatic-selective, suppressive micro-RNA (miRNA) binding sites into the untranslated regions of the mRNA [35].",

            "text": "2][3][4] LNP technology has come a long way, starting with early liposomal drug systems and advancing to sophisticated formulations designed for precise nucleic acid delivery. [7][8][9] One key feature of LNPs is their preferential accumulation in the liver, a phenomenon that has been well exploited for treating liver disease. This liver-specific tropism depends on interactions with serum proteins (e.g., apolipoprotein E [ApoE]) as well as the liver's anatomy and physiology. 10,11 Upon systemic administration, LNPs rapidly bind to ApoE, which facilitates their targeting to hepatocytes via low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor. 12 As an additional driver of LNP accumulation, the liver's participation in the reticuloendothelial system (RES) is fundamental to ApoE-mediated targeting. 10 Kupffer cells, the liver's resident macrophages that filter nanoparticles from the bloodstream, contribute to liver tropism but can also reduce ther-apeutic efficacy by trapping LNPs before they reach hepatocytes. 13 To address this limitation, lipid compositions are optimized to evade macrophage uptake or to maximize delivery to hepatocytes. 14 e role of the RES in LNP biodistribution is exemplified by Wang et al., 15 who demonstrated how hard nanomaterials are sequestered in the liver through interactions with its microarchitecture and specific cellular components. They have shown that liver-resident Kupffer cells, B cells, and endothelial cells are responsible for nanomaterial accumulation, with Kupffer cells having the highest uptake. At the same time, nanomaterials enter the liver sinusoids at a slower flow rate than in systemic circulation, which increases their probability of uptake by these phagocytic cells, such as Kupffer cells. \n\nOnce inside hepatocytes, LNPs enable applications such as gene editing, gene expression, and gene silencing 16 (Figure 1), as previously reported. 17",

            "text": "Another possible explanation for the lack of efficiency of the liposomes may have lied in the fact that in our studies each animal received ~9 \u00d7 10 12 DMG-LNPs or DSG-LNPs, suggesting that we dosed above the recently suggested 10 12 particles threshold for enhanced tumor accumulation (Ouyang et al., 2020). We speculate that the above-threshold LNP dose used in these experiments might have masked the potential effects of RES blockade, as the high LNP dose itself already might lead to enhanced circulation times and tumor accumulation of the particles. This hypothesis reinforces the earlier explanation regarding the varying protein corona profiles of different nanoparticles. It suggests that when injecting above the 10 12 nanoparticle threshold, the particles with the same protein corona may be blocking the RES clearance of surplus particles, thereby enhancing their tumor accumulation. \n\nIn an attempt to gain a deeper understanding of our in vivo results, we also conducted in vitro experiments using mouse hepatocyte and macrophage cell lines to examine how liposomes affect the cellular uptake of siRNA-LNPs. Unexpectedly, pre-treatment with the in vivo tested liposomes led to enhanced macrophage LNP uptake (Fig. 4a,b). We hypothesize that this increased uptake might result from the fact that preincubation with liposomal particles activates the phagocytic capacity of macrophages, thereby enhancing LNP uptake. Previous reports have described how liposomal cholesterol can act as an enhancer of phagocytic capacity of macrophages (Ghosh et al., 2014). Interestingly, LNP uptake in hepatocyte-derived cells was not clearly reduced after liposome pre-treatment, particularly for MC3-LNPs. These results could explain why we did not observe a decrease in LNP liver accumulation or enhanced circulation time and tumor accumulation when pre-treating the animals with liposomes in our in vivo experiments. Alternatively, the liposomes present in circulation at the time of LNP administration may contribute to LNP destabilization, thereby reducing their circulation time.",

In this process, the LNPs target only hepatocytes and only diseases related to the liver can be treated. Thus, there is a need for developing smarter systems that, after systemic administration, have the ability to target other organs to treat diseases for which there is a great demand. Targeting the spleen is one of the most promising strategies for the development of vaccines and immunotherapies. The first step in targeting the spleen, however, is to avoid uptake by the liver and the subsequent degradation of the injected system. \n\nLNPs used for systemic administrations of nucleic acids generally contain cholesterol, a pH-sensitive cationic lipid, phospholipids, and polyethylene glycol (PEG). Cholesterol contributes to the stability of LNPs in the blood [7,8]. Phospholipids contribute primarily to the stabilization of lipid membrane formation [9]. PEG contributes to the in vivo avoidance of phagocytic uptake and to retention in the blood [10]. The pH-sensitive cationic lipids contribute to the efficient loading of negatively charged nucleic acids during the LNP preparation by electrostatic interactions.",

            "text": "Improvements in RNA delivery systems based on LNPs yielded impressive results in the last few years. Nevertheless, the use of LNPs for targeted delivery to desired organs still requires optimization of lipid composition. In our review, we discussed successful examples of variations of lipid composition for targeted delivery to the spleen, lungs, pancreas, thyroid gland, placenta, and testes. Distribution of LNPs to the liver is the most typical after intravenous administration, especially for nanoparticles smaller than 100 nm. Through changes in lipid composition, it is possible to achieve preferential (in some cases, complete) redirection of nanoparticle accumulation to other organs. Apparent pK a of LNPs plays an important role in this effect. For instance, nanoparticles having pK a < 5 (they possess a negative charge in the bloodstream) tend to accumulate in the spleen, whereas particles with pK a > 11 (positive charge) in lungs. A desired value of apparent pK a of LNPs can be achieved by changing the helper lipid (SORT technology) and/or by using a combination of several ionizable cationic lipids. Application of bulkier lipids indirectly affects apparent pK a of LNPs by altering the packing of lipids in the nanoparticle and thereby changing the accessibility of ionizable groups of lipids to protonation. Redirection of LNP accumulation to the spleen can be accomplished via reductions in the amount of \"liver-specific\" cholesterol in the nanoparticles. On the other hand, for some organs, such as eyes and the brain, effective delivery systems based on LNPs have not yet been devised, and in this case, delivery to the target organ is achieved only via direct administration of the therapeutic agent. \n\nAt present, computer technologies are actively utilized to design and improve LNPs: from computer modeling to machine learning and artificial intelligence (Du et al., 2023;Maharjan et al., 2023;Cornebise et al., 2021). During the development of new ionizable lipids, the most time-consuming task is the screening of large numbers of diverse LNPs.",

            "text": "This is largely impacted by the amount and length of PEG-lipids in LNPs. For instance, LNPs with 1.5% PEG-lipids have shown more efficient delivery of the RNA cargo to hepatocytes and significantly improved gene silencing efficacy compared with LNPs with 5% PEG-lipids, despite having shorter blood circulation time. [79] Moreover, LNPs with shorter PEGlipids (C14 lipid tail) exhibit faster PEG shedding and 2.3-fold higher delivery efficiency to the liver compared with their C18 lipid tail counterparts after 24 hours of i.v. injection. [80] elper lipids, including sterols, phospholipids, and glycerolipids, are also essential components of LNP formulations and can have an impact on LNP delivery to the liver. For instance, preclinical studies have revealed that dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine-containing LNP formulations have stronger interactions with ApoE and stronger mRNA delivery to the liver than identical LNP formulations that substitute dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine with distearolyphosphatidycholine. [81] NP is an ideal RNA delivery system for treating liver diseases due to their liver tropism. Upon i.v. administration, ApoE has been identified as one of the key serum proteins that bind to LNPs, facilitating their subsequent binding to the LDLR expressed on the surface of hepatocytes, thereby enabling selective uptake of LNP into hepatocytes (Figure 3). [26,82,83] In fact, studies have demonstrated that > 80% of LNPs can be distributed to the liver within just 6 hours of i.v. administration in mouse models. [79] In the liver, it is crucial to specifically target the cells of interest since different liver diseases involve specific liver cells, and nonspecific targeting could result in toxic accumulation and significantly lower therapeutic effect.",

One significant opportunity lies in the ability to modify the protein corona composition, which can help mitigate off-target accumulation and enhance the interaction of LNPs with antigenpresenting cells and dendritic cells. This, in turn, has the potential to significantly improve vaccine efficacy. Reprinted with permission [38]. \n\nMoreover, studies have shown that upon IV administration PEG-lipid with short lipid tails tend to desorb from LNPs, inducing a change in surface structure that allows ApoE adsorption to LNPs, with the formation of a protein corona that affects their endosomal escape and mRNA release. ApoE in blood serum showed specificity for hepatocytes leading to LNP accumulation in the liver as exploited in Onpattro \u00ae formulation. In this product, the drug patisiran is delivered using LNPs composed of ionizable lipid (DLin-MC3-DMA), phosphatidylcholine derivate (DSPC), cholesterol, and PEG-lipid (PEG2000-C-DMG). Once the drug is administered into the systemic circulation, the PEG-lipid is replaced by serum proteins, mainly ApoE, which interact with the cholesterol component of the lipid complex and target the drug to the liver [117,118]. Furthermore, PEG-lipids can be functionalized with specific ligands such as folate for siRNA delivery or N-acetylgalactosamine for targeting liver hepatocytes [80]. \n\nFor instance, the addition of PEG or poloxamine coatings to NPs has been found to reduce complement activation, while dextran coatings increase it. Furthermore, Figure 6. The illustration underscores the primary challenges and drawbacks associated with LNP vaccines. One significant opportunity lies in the ability to modify the protein corona composition, which can help mitigate off-target accumulation and enhance the interaction of LNPs with antigenpresenting cells and dendritic cells. This, in turn, has the potential to significantly improve vaccine efficacy. Reprinted with permission [38].",

            "text": "This result is further supported by Sato et al., 61 who showed that uptake mechanisms in hepatocytes vary based on ionizable lipid structure. They further showed that the apparent pKa of the ionizable lipid influences intrahepatic LNP distribution, which can be tuned by modifying the chemical structure around a tertiary amine. LNP-based siRNA therapies also show that while LNPs accumulate in the liver, gene silencing depends on factors such as dosing, lipid composition, and cell interactions. 62 For example, inefficient endosomal escape can limit delivery despite favorable biodistribution. \n\nDifferent LNP formulations show variability in functional delivery despite similar levels of biodistribution. For example, LNPs formulated with sphingomyelin or DSPC exhibited different transfection efficiencies in hepatocytes compared with other liver cells. 59 The structure of ionizable lipids, in particular the head group and tail (carbon chain) length, is an important factor driving both liver uptake and functional delivery. For example, lipids such as DLin-MC3-DMA with a pKa in the range of 6.2-6.5 have been shown to be optimized for liver-specific gene silencing in hepatocytes. 12 Recent research found that biodegradable ketal-ester lipids, used as ionizable lipids, made delivery more efficient while reducing liver toxicity. Their rapid breakdown in the liver also improved safety. 63 Couture-Sen\u00e9cal et al. 64 reported how the chemical structure of ionizable lipids influences their hydrolysis rates, modifying biodegradability and liver retention. With cell-free hydrolysis assays involving lipases and base reactions, they found that lipids with sterically accessible ester bonds, e.g., LP-01 and SM-102, were rapidly hydrolyzed and cleared from the liver. In contrast, more sterically hindered lipids, e.g., DLin-MC3-DMA and ALC-0315, exhibited slower degradation, resulting in prolonged liver retention.",

            "text": "After establishing LNP delivery to hepatocytes, we examined the targeted delivery of mRNA-loaded LNPs to different types of liver cells by controlling their size and PEG-lipid content. Among these cells, we focused on LSECs, where many of liver-related diseases originated. First, we hypothesized that as LSECs reside in the liver blood wall, LNPs that cannot penetrate the fenestrae will be uptaken into the LSECs. We prepared various LNPs loaded with mCre, and their size was ranging from 50 to 100 nm by varying PEG-lipid (%) (Fig. 5, A and B). For a change in the mole ratio of PEG-lipid, the change must be replaced with the mole ratio of other components. Mole ratio of PEG-lipid was varied by expending that of cholesterol. We have chosen cholesterol because, first, cholesterol has the least effect on endosomal release compared to other lipids (35). Second, cholesterol accounts for a large mole ratio among the lipid compositions, so this small change only accounts for less than 10% of the original, which will have very little impact. LNPs with mCre (0.5 mg/kg) were intravenously injected into mice. Two-days after injection, the liver was extracted and tdTomato-positive cells were confirmed by histology evaluation and flow cytometry analysis. \n\nFigure 5C and fig. S9 (A to C) show that LNPs with 68 nm (1.5% PEG-lipid) exhibited potent tdTomato fluorescence in hepatocytes. Smaller LNPs with less than 100 nm in size could easily penetrate the fenestrae upon entering the liver blood vessel and showed maximum expression of tdTomato fluorescence in hepatocytes at PEG-lipid content of 1.5% with 60 nm in size. However, reduced tdTomato fluorescence throughout the liver cells was observed with LNP formulations with 3% PEG-lipid. The observed phenomenon of reduced tdTomato fluorescence in higher PEG-lipid content may be attributed to the reduced ApoE-mediated cellular uptake of LNPs (36).",

            "text": "One of the most frequently used delivery methods for RNA are lipid nanoparticles (LNP) and liposomes, formed from cationic or ionizable lipids that encapsulate the RNA. Traditional liposomes comprise one or more lipid bilayers surrounding an aqueous core, while lipid nanoparticles consist of disordered micellar aggregates with an outer lipid layer [59]. The stability can be engineered through incorporation of cholesterol and neutral lipids, while the use of a polyethyleneglycol (PEG) layer can increase the circulation time by reducing opsonization and thus elimination by the reticuloendothelial system (RES) [60]. LNP-formulated mRNA has been explored in clinical studies for methylmalonic acidemia, ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, cystic fibrosis, cancer immunotherapy, Fabry disease and infectious diseases. Most of these formulations contain an ionizable lipid like (6Z,9Z,28Z,31Z)-heptatriacont-6,9,28,31-tetraene-19-yl 4-(dimethylamino)butanoate (DLin-MC3-DMA) [11,12,19,59,[61][62][63]. While a certain degree of accumulation of this type of LNP in the kidneys has been shown, they mostly direct the cargo towards the liver [64,65]. This organ tropism is a consequence of the dissociation of the PEG-shield from the LNP, leading to opsonization of the nanoparticle with the plasma protein apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which has a high affinity for the LDL receptor on hepatocytes [66]. The siRNA-based therapeutic for a hereditary form of amyloidosis, Patisiran, uses this type of lipid vehicle to deliver an siRNA molecule to the liver [58]. Fabry disease is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the alpha-galactosidase gene, leading to glycosphingolipid accumulation and damage to the kidney, among other organs.",

            "text": "We have previously shown that inhibition of androgen receptor (AR) expression and reduction of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) serum levels in mouse models of human prostate cancer (PCa) can be achieved by intravenous (i.v.) administration of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) containing small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting the gene encoding the AR (LNP-AR-siRNA). 1 However, relatively high doses (six doses at 10 mg siRNA/kg body weight) were required to see appreciable effects. 3][4] This largedose disparity is attributed to the liver's favorable physiology and to endogenous processes that result in targeting of LNPs to hepatocytes. 3,5 In particular, LNPs associate with apolipoprotein E (ApoE) 3,6 following i.v. administration and are taken into hepatocytes through the LDL receptor, the scavenger receptor, and the \"LDL-like\" receptor. 3,7 Although it is unlikely that potencies equivalent to those seen for gene silencing in hepatocytes can be achieved in localized and disseminated PCa, reductions in current dose levels must be achieved for this approach to become a viable clinical strategy. \n\nThe objective of this study was to improve the potency of the LNP-siRNA system developed previously. 1 The primary techniques that we explored concerned using a different polyethylene glycol (PEG)-lipid to achieve longer circulation lifetimes and facilitate higher levels of LNP accumulation at tumor sites, as well as the use of targeting ligands attached to the LNP-siRNA system to specifically enhance uptake into PCa cells following arrival at the tumor site.",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are the leading nonviral technologies for the delivery of exogenous RNA to target cells in vivo. As systemic delivery platforms, these technologies are exemplified by Onpattro, an approved LNP\u2010based RNA interference therapy, administered intravenously and targeted to parenchymal liver cells. The discovery of systemically administered LNP technologies capable of preferential RNA delivery beyond hepatocytes has, however, proven more challenging. Here, preceded by comprehensive mechanistic understanding of in vivo nanoparticle biodistribution and bodily clearance, an LNP\u2010based messenger RNA (mRNA) delivery platform is rationally designed to preferentially target the hepatic reticuloendothelial system (RES). Evaluated in embryonic zebrafish, validated in mice, and directly compared to LNP\u2013mRNA systems based on the lipid composition of Onpattro, RES\u2010targeted LNPs significantly enhance mRNA expression both globally within the liver and specifically within hepatic RES cell types. Hepatic RES targeting requires just a single lipid change within the formulation of Onpattro to switch LNP surface charge from neutral to anionic. This technology not only provides new opportunities to treat liver\u2010specific and systemic diseases in which RES cell types play a key role but, more importantly, exemplifies that rational design of advanced RNA therapies must be preceded by a robust understanding of the dominant nano\u2013biointeractions involved.",

This work is able to demonstrate significantly increased hepatic uptake of siRNA\u2010LNP by the BLT1i in Ldlr\u2212/\u2212 mice by in vivo imaging and discover an induction of specific uptake\u2010related proteins. Irrespective of the inhibitors and Ldlr deficiency, the siRNA\u2010LNP induced RNA\u2010binding and transport\u2010related proteins in liver, including haptoglobin (HP) that is also identified as most upregulated serum protein. This work observes a downregulation of proteins functioning in hepatic detoxification and of serum opsonins. Most strikingly, the HDLRi reduces hepatic uptake and increases siRNA accumulation in spleen and myeloid immune cells of blood and liver. RNA sequencing demonstrates leukocyte recruitment by the siRNA\u2010LNP and the HDLRi through induction of chemokine ligands in liver tissue. The data provide insights into key mechanisms of siRNA\u2010LNP biodistribution and indicate that the HDLRi has potential for extrahepatic and leukocyte targeting.",

            "text": "49 Furthermore, the use of galactosylated PEI targeting the ASGPR proved to be very efficient in transducing human hepatic cell lines and the livers of mice and rats. PEI nanoparticles and derivatives have been used experimentally for the delivery of different drugs, including siRNA and microRNAs (miRNAs), for the treatment of liver malignancies, but no clinical studies have yet been performed. 50 Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have very similar composition to cell membranes. Th y are formed by amphiphilic lipids that when dispersed in an aqueous environment spontaneously form spherical structures with a hydrophilic interior. LNPs are a suitable carrier for nucleic acid delivery because of their excellent biocompatibility, biodegradability, low toxicity and immunogenicity, structural flexibility, and ease of large-scale preparation. The use of LNPs has experienced a significant resurgence in GT as vehicles for siRNA and mRNAs. 51 However, the major challenge when developing LNP-based gene therapies is finding effective, tissue-specific delivery strategies. 52 Traditionally, targeting is achieved by physically or chemically conjugating ligands for specific receptors onto the nanoparticle surface. A  geting approach was developed by binding a multivalent GalNAc-cluster to the LNP. These nanoparticles have been shown to deliver mRNA molecules to hepatocytes with high efficiency, correcting mouse models of genetic diseases such as methylmalonic acidemia (MMA), PH1, GSD1a, citrin deficiency, acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), maple syrup urine disease, arginase deficiency, OTC deficiency, and progressive familial cholestasis type 3 (PFIC3). [53][54][55][56][57][58][59] The duration of action of a single dose of mRNA-LNP lasted between 2-3 weeks, requiring repeat administration to prolong a curative effect. These encouraging results supported the initiation of a phase I/II trial for the treatment of MMA (Table 1).",

We have highlighted challenges related to in vitro/in vivo studies of nanomedicines including LNPs and summarized the key functions of different lipid components (Fig. 8). Further, we discussed immunological concerns associated with certain lipid components and provided examples from the literature of possible strategies for directing LNPs beyond the liver. The latter two aspects ultimately define the in vivo fate of LNPs, and thus, solutions to these will put us in a stronger position to realize some of the therapeutic potential that nucleic acid-based modalities hold.\n\nThat all said, it is important that the LNP field focused on translational research is not sidetracked by very complex LNP designs, which are likely to fail in clinical trials. The field also needs to embrace basic research to increase our fundamental understanding on e.g., LNP uptake processes, endosomal escape mechanisms, the interplay between LNP structures/components and the immune system, and safe ligands that can enrich LNPs in certain organ/tissues. These 'small' but solid steps, including learning from the more mature liposome field, will hopefully allow us to take a giant leap towards making more clinically successful nucleic acid-based vaccines and therapies that employ LNP delivery.",

The manuscript is well-written. The preclinical data on the propionic acidemia model formed the rationale for a first in human clinical trial. However, the designs of the individual preclinical experiments for the three diseases are rather different. Although the common root is the investigation of mRNA therapy in inborn errors of metabolism, given that there are distinct biological and clinical differences between the disorders, the rationale for lumping all three experiments into a single manuscript is unclear. \n\nTo facilitate comparisons to other investigators in the field, more details regarding the design, production, and purification of the mRNA/LNP formulation should be provided. \n\nRegarding the mRNAs, how were these synthesized? Did they incorporate modified bases and optimized untranslated regions? How were they capped? How were they purified prior to loading into LNPs? \n\nRegarding the LNPs, the terminology SM86/OL-56 is used in the manuscript to identify the lipids incorporated into the LNP, but this will have no meaning to anyone who is not an aficionado of the field. The meaning of these abbreviations should be included. However, more information regarding the LNP structure is necessary. What were the final ratios of the cationic lipid: phospholipid: cholesterol: PEG? What method was used to mix the lipids with the mRNA? How were the complexes then purified? In what solution were the complexes finally suspended for intravenous injection? I understand that some of the details of the LNP structure may be proprietary, but I am not asking for sufficient information that reagents can be duplicated. However, the details I have requested, I propose, are key to understanding both efficacy and toxicity of mRNA/LNP therapeutics. Without this information, it is impossible to compare the outcomes of different experiments in the literature. Also, this is a small point, but an irritation I have with the mRNA field as a whole.",

            "text": "One major feature, and limitation at times, with LNP delivery is their propensity for liver accumulation, where they are taken up by the RES [105]. Upon systematic administration [106], various serum electrolytes, proteins, and lipids will adsorb onto the LNP's surface and form the so-called \"biomolecular corona\" [107]. This corona can significantly influence the journey of systematically administered NPs from biodistribution and cellular uptake [108] to systematic circulations and nano-bio interactions [109]. The composition of ionizable lipid particles can have a considerable effect on the formed corona [110]. ApoE is one of the most implicated serum proteins that play a significant role in the clearance and endogenous LNPs targeting to hepatic cells [72]. The delivery of nucleic acids to the liver is partly attributed to the organ's well-perfused nature and its fenestrations as well [100]. It has been recognized that LNPs accumulate in different cells present within the liver [111][112][113]. Particle size, lipase sensitivity, and apparent pKa are some characteristics that govern the intrahepatic distribution of LNPs [114]. Chen et al. investigated the effect of particle size on influencing the tissue penetration and potential of LNP formulations of siRNA. They injected the LNPs intravenously into mice and found that regardless of the size, the majority of LNPs were found 24 h after injection in the liver. Less than 1% of the LNP formulations were found in the kidney, pancreas, lung, heart and femur. However, ~10% of the 80 nm size LNPs was found in the spleen. Since the particle size did not seem to be heavily involved in liver accumulation, they further investigated other parameters that can reduce the potency of small LNPs for silencing. In the end, they concluded that there was a clear hierarchy of LNP formulated siRNAs' capability for gene silencing (78 > 42 > 38 > 27 > 117 nm).",

Despite some progress, delivery systems are still unable to fully achieve this. Here, we reformulate lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) through adjustments in lipid material structures and compositions to systematically achieve the pulmonary and hepatic (respectively) targeted mRNA distribution and expression. A combinatorial library of degradable-core based ionizable cationic lipids is designed, following by optimisation of LNP compositions. Contrary to current LNP paradigms, our findings demonstrate that cholesterol and phospholipid are dispensable for LNP functionality. Specifically, cholesterol-removal addresses the persistent challenge of preventing nanoparticle accumulation in hepatic tissues. By modulating and simplifying intrinsic LNP components, concurrent mRNA accumulation and translation is achieved in the lung and liver, respectively. This targeting strategy is applicable to existing LNP systems with potential to expand the progress of precise mRNA therapy for diverse diseases.",

            "text": "Over the last few years, LNP-based RNA vaccines have been administered to hundreds of millions of people. \n\nThese nanoparticles are made of a polyethylene (PEG) lipid, phospholipid, cholesterol, and a cationic lipid and have an average particle size of 70-90 nm and are suitable for delivery of DNA and RNA molecules (Brader et al., 2021;Cui et al., 2022). When loaded with RNA, LNPs not only protect their payload from degradation but are also capable of delivering it to cells and facilitate their intracellular entry (Whitehead et al., 2009). When injected intramuscularly or intravenously, LNPs deliver most of their payload to the liver where a dose as low as 2.5 mg/kg can effectively suppress hepatocyte gene expression for as long as 11 days after a single injection (Zimmermann et al., 2006). \n\nWhile to date all clinically approved LNP-base therapies target the liver (Love et al., 2010), there is an urgent need to develop LNP formulations that allow payload delivery to non-hepatic organs and tissues. This has been, in part, facilitated by the development of new lipid-like molecule lipidoid libraries (Love et al., 2010;Alabi et al., 2013). By screening epoxide-modified lipid-polymer hybrids at different lipid:siRNA ratios, R. Langer, D. Anderson and colleagues identified a new branched lipid compound termed 7C1 that exhibit long circulation time and preferential payload delivery to ECs with reduced hepatic accumulation (Dahlman et al., 2014). Interestingly, the reason for the preferential endothelial uptake of 7C1 LNPs has never been established.",

            "text": "For example, Liu Shuai et al. developed a novel LNP delivery technology by removing cholesterol and phospholipids, maintaining the integrity of LNP, and conferring true targeting capabilities (Figure 3). 67 LNP is designed with a reasonable lipid structure and composition, which enables the simultaneous organtargeted accumulation and translation of mRNA. The team has fundamentally altered the conceptualization of LNP, developing 3-Comp and a conventional LNP based on a central set of biodegradable cationic lipids, thereby attaining precise targeting of the lungs and liver, respectively. In contrast to earlier LNP formulations designed to target liver cells, the customized nAcx CM lipids incorporated into typical LNPs have the potential to induce liver endothelial cell selectivity. Subsequently, the 3-Comp LNP strategy for removing cholesterol provided a solution to the significant challenge of avoiding liver accumulation and achieving true lung targeting (accumulation and translation) after systemic administration. This organ-targeting method applies to other existing ionizable cationic lipids and LNPs, thereby enriching the diversity of current LNP delivery systems and expanding their targeting possibilities. 67 The team's approach to organ-targeted delivery has demonstrated considerable promise in the development of mRNA drugs with reduced adverse effects. Meanwhile, LNP can be utilized to deliver CRISPR/Cas9 components, enabling genome editing in animal models. 68 However, the stability of LNP can be affected by interactions between its components. LNP instability can be attributed to physical and chemical factors. To enhance stability and prevent physical instability, measures such as adding polyethylene glycol (PEG) can be taken to prevent aggregation, fusion, and content leakage in LNP. Chemical instability in LNP lipids is mainly caused by hydrolysis and oxidation. For example, DSPC and ionizable cationic lipids are highly susceptible to hydrolysis during storage, which is dependent on temperature and pH due to the presence of carboxylate bonds. 63,69 When ionizable lipids are present in LNP fractions, aldehyde impurities can be produced through oxidation and hydrolysis pathways.",

            "text": "In contrast, hepatic tissue may be the focus of LNP (lipid nanoparticle) administration methods using ionizable amino lipids, which have recently emerged as the principal siRNA delivery approach with many products now in clinical trials. siRNA-loaded LNPs were able to cause silencing of genes in the hepatocytes when its vaccine was injected intravenously at low doses of 0.005 mg/kg b.w. in animals [120]. The liposomal nanoparticle vaccine formulation known as SMARTICLES, with a size of roughly 120 nm, has been used in phase I clinical studies to deliver the tumour-suppressing miR-34. As for efficacy, biodistribution, and safety, all were maximised compared with other delivery strategies [179]. The efficacy of the vaccine formulated by conjugating ASOs with GN3 (N-acetyl galactosamine), a high-affinity ligand for the hepatocyte-specific ASGPR (asialoglycoprotein receptor), was tested in the liver of mice and was found to increase by 6-10 fold [180].",

            "text": "Notably, liver accumulation is known to correlate positively with particle size. This trend holds true for many classes of nanoparticles including AuNPs [270], SiNPs [271], and polymeric nanoparticles [272] Conversely, smaller nanoparticles (<5 nm) are typically excreted in the urine. In nearly all cases, coating nanoparticles with polyethylene glycol (PEG) confers \"stealth\" properties for prolonged circulation and evasion of excretion. \n\nWith the successful launch of multiple LNP-delivered RNA drugs in the past few years, many have sought to modify LNP tropism to expand their therapeutic utility. For example, preferential organ accumulation of systemically administered ionizable LNPs can be modulated by the amount of cationic lipids used during formulation [172,173]. Moreover, differential delivery of RNA LNPs to cell types within the liver is also possible by adjusting the proportion of PEG-lipid [273]. Multiple reports have also demonstrated that both charge and size of LNPs affect their tropism and delivery to different immune cell subtypes [274]. \n\nFor bioinspired nanocarriers such as cell-derived exosomes, particle properties are less easily manipulated, as their composition is already defined at the time of harvesting. The protein and lipid composition of exosomes' outer membrane largely determines its specificity. Exosomes are preferentially taken up by target cells with similar membrane composition to the production cell. Thus, one strategy for targeting exosomes to the correct tissue is to isolate them from the same types of cells as the target.",

            "text": "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the use of LNPs (lipid nanoparticles) for the transport of siRNA to the liver [108] and mRNA vaccines [109,110]. Micelles, liposomes, and LNPs (Figure 1) are all different forms of lipids differentiated by the overall size of the hydrophilic head group and hydrophobic tail or tails [111]. Each of the four major components (cationic or ionizable lipid, helper lipid, cholesterol, and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-lipid) (Figure 2) constitute FDA-approved LNPs. Studies using lipid-based delivery systems complexed with nucleic acid [112,113] indicate that lipid structure modifies LNPs' interactions with cells [114]. Hundreds to thousands of chemically distinct lipid delivery systems [115,116] have been developed as a result of the fact that lipid structure influences the delivery of nucleic acids and that such systems can be easily produced using Michael addition-based, epoxide-based, and alcohol-based chemical reactions. Many of these studies aimed to enhance the delivery of siRNA to hepatocytes or the liver cells of mice [117]. In conjunction with a more rational approach to lipid design [114], these investigations reduced the dosage required for robust in vivo gene silencing in the hepatocytes of mice from around 1.0 mg/kg [118] to 0.002 mg/kg. DLin-KC2-DMA is an ionizable lipid [114]; cKK-E12 is a peptide-like lipid compound [119]; DLin-MC3-DMA [120] was used in patisiran to treat hATTR [108]; and C12-200 was synthesised using an epoxide-amine reaction [117], LNPs have been used to transport messenger RNA (mRNA) to the livers of mice, non-human primates, and humans.

The CL4H6 lipid contains two very long hexyl oleate chains (C24 + O1) ( Fig. 2A). The CL4H6-LNPs exhibited an ED 50 of 0.0025 mg/kg in a mouse F7 model. We found that 4.2% of the siRNA was loaded in the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) at 24 h after intravenous administration, suggesting that endosomal escape was better compared to MC3. The CL4H6 also exhibited a better tolerability compared to MC3-LNPs due to the fact that the CL4H6 is biodegradable. It is known that phosphocholine (PC)-containing neutral lipids, including phosphatidylcholines and sphingomyelins (SMs), are cylindrical-shaped and therefore stabilize bilayers and strongly inhibit membrane fusion [52,57]. We revealed that the long hexyl oleate scaffolds can overcome the inhibitory effect of PC-containing neutral lipids on the fusogenicity of the LNPs",

Preclinical studies determined that LNP with diffusible PEG-lipids rapidly accumulate in the liver, with circulation half-lives of less than 15 minutes 62,73 . This rapid accumulation and potency for hepatocyte transfection stemmed from ApoE adsorption. \n\nLNP\u2212siRNA manufacturing required a rapid, reproducible procedure. This was accomplished through an ethanol-loading technique that involved mixing preformed LNP (at pH 4) with nucleic acids in the presence of high ethanol concentrations (~40% v/v) 74 . A subsequently developed higher-throughput rapid mixing process combined lipids dissolved in ethanol with nucleic acids in an aqueous buffer (pH 4) through a T-junction, resulting in efficient nucleic acid loading into LNP systems 75 . Rapid-mixing techniques produced LNP\u2212 siRNA systems with high entrapment efficiencies (>85%) and narrow size distributions. Recent work suggests that such structures include a hydrophobic oil core primarily consisting of neutral ionizable lipid surrounded by siRNA complexed to lipids in a bilayer arrangement 76 with heterogeneity in the siRNA copy number per particle 77 . \n\nClinical example.

Hepatocytes comprise most of the liver, which also contains Kupffer cells and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). The liver is the main organ to take up synthetic nanoparticles administered systemically. Studies including [63] have shown that preference for hepatocytes over the reticuloendothelial system (RES), which includes Kupffer cells and LSECs, can be tuned by making LNP sizes either smaller or larger than the diameter of the fenestrations in the liver (50-300 nm [104] and 107 \u00b1 1.5 nm [57]). Kim et al. [105] show that grafting mannose onto LNPs allowed for selective delivery of RNA to LSECs while minimizing unwanted cellular uptake by hepatocytes. Interestingly, Saunders et al. [106] exploited the dimensions of the fenestrations in the liver, in an alternate way, to increase LNP accumulation in cells other than the Kupffer cells and LSECs that usually take up a significant portion of nanoparticles administered systemically [107]. Specifically, Saunders et al. [106] administered non-toxic liposomes, termed nanoprimers, that were larger than the fenestrae of the liver capillaries and designed to transiently occupy RES cells in the liver prior to LNP administration. This strategy improved LNP nucleic acid-mediated knockdown and translation efficiency of targets in hepatocytes.",

The % injected dose that distributes to the spleen is much less than the liver as it is a much smaller organ but the chain length trends are similar. \n\nIn summary, we demonstrate that the presence of a 1.5 mol % PEG 2000 -lipid steric barrier does not significantly affect in vivo hepatic gene silencing for siRNA LNPs. However, increasing the PEG-lipid concentration by just 1 mol % can significantly reduce activity unless a short chain PEG-C14 is used, which rapidly desorbs from LNPs in the circulation and transfers to lipoproteins and erythrocytes. Moreover, different combinations of PEG-lipid chain length and concentration can be employed to modify the PK and BD of siRNA LNPs without greatly impacting hepatic gene silencing.",

            "text": "Different surface charges result in the distinction of serum proteins adsorbed to LNPs, which determines the subsequent organspecific distribution of LNPs 49 . Specifically, positively charged LNPs predominantly accumulate in the lungs of mice, while near-neutral LNPs present a liver accumulation. Therefore, the manipulation of surface charge by LNP formulation emerges as a feasible way to achieve the organ-selective delivery of LNPs. The systematic-selective lipid nanoparticle (Liver-LNPs) system is a classic four-component formulation that consists of cholesterol, 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-choline (DSPC), poly(ethylene glycol) lipids (PEG-lipid), and ionizable lipids (Fig. 3b). The ionizable lipid can be converted into its quaternary ammonium salt form via a simple and effective reaction with methyl iodide to afford a cationic targeting lipid (Fig. 3a). By adding the additional permanently cationic targeting lipid and replacing DSPC with 1,2dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) in the Liver-LNP formulation (Fig. 3b), we successfully obtained lung-selective LNPs (Lung-LNPs), which were capable of precisely delivering mRNA to the lungs. mRNA-loaded LNPs were formed by mixing an aqueous buffer solution containing mRNA and a lipid ethanol solution at the aqueousto-ethanol ratio of 3/1, v/v. Firefly luciferase mRNA (mRNA Luci ) was encapsulated by the two organ-selective LNPs, giving Liver-LNPs@mRNA Luci and Lung-LNPs@mRNA Luci . Both the obtained Liver-LNPs@mRNA Luci and Lung-LNPs@mRNA Luci were uniformly spherical assemblies with a diameter of ~60-100 nm according to the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Fig. 3c).",

            "text": "RNA interference represents a highly attractive alternative to current treatment regimens, however, extrahepatic delivery of siRNA using LNPs has proven difficult due to high liver accumulation. Modification of the LNP surface with targeting ligands could potentially improve LNP uptake beyond the liver. Here we show that targeting the VLA-4 receptor using the LDV motif on the surface of LNPs improved the cellular uptake of LNPs in HSPCs ex vivo and in vivo. These combined data thereby provide evidence for the use of LDV-LNPs for the treatment of hematological disorders. \n\nHigh liver accumulation is commonly reported for both liposomes and LNP-based therapies. Both LNPs, targeting and non-targeting, used in this study displayed a short circulation time of 45 min. However, longer circulation times are desired as this will improve the passive accumulation of LNPs in extrahepatic tissues [48]. The circulation time is dictated by the lipid components of the nanoparticle formulation and can be finetuned modifying the length of the PEG-lipid chain, as longer lipid chains will increase the circulation time [49,50]. Since longer circulation times of PEG usually result in reduced endosomal release and will also increase the chances of evoking an anti-PEG immune response [51], PEG does not seem to possess ideal characteristics for being incorporated in LNPs for in vivo usage. As an alternative, PEG could be replaced with polysaccharides, naturally occurring membrane lipids, or stealth-providing compounds such as polysarcosine to shield the nanoparticle from rapid removal by opsonization [52][53][54][55][56]. Additionally, an attractive concept is passive targeting by changing the lipid formulation, however, little is known about the optimal lipid composition for bone marrow targeting [57][58][59]. For liposomes, it is reported that cholesterol aids in bone marrow uptake by phagocytic cells via selective opsonization such as C3 complement protein-an interesting point for future studies on targeting the bone marrow with LNPs [60,61].",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) composed of ionizable cationic lipids are currently the leading systems for siRNA delivery in liver disease, with the major limitation of low siRNA release efficacy into the cytoplasm. Ionizable cationic lipids are known to be of critical importance in LNP structure and stability, siRNA entrapment, and endosomal disruption. However, their distribution inside the LNPs and their exact role in cytoplasmic delivery remain unclear. A recent study [Kulkarni et al., On the formation and morphology of lipid nanoparticles containing ionizable cationic lipids and siRNA, ACS Nano, 2018, 12(5), 4787-4795] on LNP-siRNA systems containing the ionizable lipid DLin-KC2-DMA (also known as KC2 with an apparent pKa of ca. 6.7) suggested that neutral KC2 segregates from other components and forms an amorphous oil droplet in the core of LNPs. In this paper, we present evidence supporting the model proposed by Kulkarni et al. We studied KC2 segregation in the presence of POPC using molecular dynamics simulation, deuterium NMR, SAXS, and cryo-TEM experiments, and found that neutral KC2 has a high tendency to separate from POPC dispersions. KC2 confinement, upon raising the pH during the formulation process, could result in rearrangement of the internal structure of LNPs. As interactions between cationic KC2 and anionic endosomal lipids are thought to be a key factor in cargo release, KC2 confinement inside the LNP may be responsible for the observed low release efficacy.",

            "text": "Upon entering the blood stream, nanoparticles rapidly absorb serum proteins on their surface. The effects of protein corona heavily control the biodistribution of nanoparticles. For some LNPs, ApoE adsorption is essential for the cellular uptake of LNPs. Akinc et al. (15) have described the role of ApoE in the in vivo uptake of LNPs by hepatocytes. They compared the uptake of LNPs by hepatocytes in wild-type and ApoE knockout mice. The activity of LNPs was remarkably reduced in ApoE knockout (ApoE \u2212/\u2212 ) mice compared to wild-type mice. Since the major cell population in the liver is hepatocytes and they overexpress LDLR, an alternative targeting ligand is necessary for LSEC-specific delivery of RNA other than the ApoE. Previously, specific targeting ligands were evaluated for enhancing the selective delivery of LNPs to target cells (15). Kumar et al. (36) showed decreased activity of LNPs with higher PEG-lipid content in hepatocytes due to reduced association of ApoE with LNPs. They showed that LNPs with 5% PEG-lipid have a lower binding affinity with ApoE compared to LNPs with 1.5% PEG-lipid. By introducing unique targeting ligands to the highly PEGylated LNPs, ApoE-mediated cellular uptake can be blocked and selective delivery of LNPs can be achieved. \n\nAmong various liver cells, LSECs are substantial targets for RNA therapeutics because LSECs are closely related to fetal liver diseases resulting from LSECs-derived gene products (17,19). To achieve the selective delivery of LNPs to LSECs, we introduced LSEC-specific ligands to highly PEGylated LNPs. Mannose receptor is one of the receptors that specifically expressed on human and mice LSECs (17). Mannose-conjugated nanoparticles have been investigated in various targeted delivery studies, and these nanoparticles have been proven to be safe (37,38).",

In the blood circulation and among different functions, ApoE is involved in the transportation of lipids to the liver for recycling. Recently, Sebastiani et al. [117] showed that the binding of ApoE induce lipid rearrangement of the shell and the core of LNPs, potentially leading to a different endosomal escape. To study this effect, they produced LNPs made of deuterated lipids coupled with a small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) analysis, to decipher the composition and the global structure of the LNPs, but also more precisely the distribution of the lipids around the particle. After incubation with ApoE, rearrangement between the lipid in the shell and the core occurs, which leads to a drop in mRNA encapsulation 1 day post-incubation. More interestingly, cholesterol enrichment in the shell is observed. Even if more studies are still needed, it appears that ApoE interaction with LNPs can explain the liver accumulation, thanks to its biological role. Moreover, the difference in transfection efficiency could be linked to a change in the lipid composition of the shell/core after this interaction.",

            "text": "Since siRNA specifically inhibits the target protein functions via the specific cleaving of the target mRNA, it has been receiving significant attention as an anti-cancer agent. To date, there have been several successful and unique reports for treating tumors using LNPs. Before the development of LNPs (siRNA-encapsulated lipid nanoparticles), siRNA was delivered to the target organs via systemic administration by attaching siRNA onto the particle (liposome) surface (lipoplex) [118,119]. Since the accumulation of lipoplex in a tumor relies on the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect [120,121], the surface of the lipoplex can be modified with a hydrophilic PEG polymer to increase its circulation time after intravenous injection; otherwise, the lipoplex is rapidly captured by the reticuloendothelial system. On the other hand, it was reported that LNPs without a large amount of PEG modification are highly effective for liver targeting [28,122,123]. LNPs prepared with ionizable lipids form a protein corona in the bloodstream [124]. ApoE in the protein corona is recognized by receptors such as LDLR, which are overexpressed by hepatocytes [125]. Then, the complexes are internalized into hepatocytes via the ApoE-LDLR pathway [28,122,123]. Since the formation of the protein corona in the bloodstream is important for the liver targeting of LNPs, only a small amount of PEG modification (~1% as a molar ratio) of the LNP is standard protocol in the case of liver targeting. This means that the PEG modification for liver targeting is not for obtaining long circulation of LNPs after systemic administration but for increasing their stability in the bloodstream, such as by inhibition of aggregation.\n\nIn general, ionizable lipids in LNPs are positively charged at lower pH (pH~6.0); therefore, highly hydrophobic LNPs tend to aggregate at physiological pH (pH 7.4). A small amount of PEG modification increases LNP stability in the bloodstream and may not inhibit ApoE binding in the bloodstream. For example, Huang et al. prepared polymerlipid hybrid",

[19] LNP has been considered for application in the treatment of non-cancer liver diseases such as liver fibrosis. [20] o test our hypothesis of whether HERC2 overexpressed plasmids delivered by LNP are able to mitigate DILI, we constructed LNP-wrapped HERC2 overexpressed plasmids (Figure 7A; Figure S4, Supporting Information). Plasmids encapsulated LNPs were mainly distributed in liver at 24 hours post injection (Figure 7B) and were dispersed near vein area (Figure 7C). The results showed plasmids encapsulated LNPs successfully promoted HERC2 expression in hepatocytes. (Figure 7D,E) We next investigated the regulatory function of HERC2-overexpressed plasmid encapsulated LNPs in APAP hepatoxicity (Figure 7F). The pathology analysis indicated ameliorated liver damage in APAP-injected mice treated with HERC2-overexpressed plasmid encapsulated LNPs compared to the controls (Figure 7G). Consistently, declined serum SGPT and SGOT level was found in HERC2-overexpressed plasmid encapsulated LNPs-treated mice compared to control mice (Figure 7H). We also observed attenuated accumulation of APAP-adducts (Figure 7I,J) and MDA (Figure 7K) in liver tissues when mice were treated with HERC2-loaded LNPs . Moreover, HERC2-loaded LNPs administration markedly decreased CYP2E1 expression in hepatocytes (Figure 7L,M), which was caused by impaired -catenin level (Figure 7N). Together, the data indicated that targeted delivery of HERC2-overexpressed plasmid encapsulated LNPs attenuated DILI by modulating -catenin activity and consequent CYP2E1 expression.",

            "text": "In previous studies, we defined the structure-activity relationship for dialkyl amino lipids with respect to hepatic gene silencing. Applying these molecular principles resulted in the synthesis of a highly active, novel amino lipid dilinoleylmethyl-4-dimethylaminobutyrate (DLin-MC3-DMA), which is referred to as MC3 and is the amino lipid used in the studies described here. 5 LNPs containing MC3 and encapsulating siRNA therapeutics are currently in Phase II clinical trials for hypercholesterolemia and transthyretin amyloidosis. 1,2 ore recently, we have developed novel, next-generation lipids that combine the excellent potency of the most advanced lipids currently available with biodegradable functionality. 9 n this work, we turn our attention to the PEG-lipid component of siRNA LNPs. PEG-lipids are typically incorporated into lipid-based drug delivery systems to provide a hydrophilic steric barrier that inhibits the binding of plasma proteins, including opsonins, which mark LNPs for removal by the mononuclear phagocytic system. The resulting increase in circulation lifetime enables drug delivery vehicles to take full advantage of enhanced permeability and retention effects, resulting in their accumulation at sites of disease. 10 owever, PEG-lipid is incorporated into the current generation of siRNA LNPs for quite a different reason. Its primary role is to facilitate the self-assembly of LNPs by providing a steric barrier at the surface of nascent particles formed when siRNA is rapidly mixed in acidic ethanol solutions with positively charged amino lipids. PEG steric hindrance prevents inter-particle fusion and promotes the formation of a homogeneous population of siRNA LNPs with diameters <100 nm. 11,12 et the presence of a PEG shield on siRNA LNPs in vivo inhibits hepatic gene silencing activity. The protection it provides against interactions with plasma proteins appears to also interfere with Apo E-mediated endocytosis into hepatocytes. 8 Moreover, PEG-lipids reduce the close apposition and fusion required for the release of siRNA into the cytoplasm from endocytic vesicles. 13",

            "text": "Along the lines above, Ouyang et al. [108] reported that doses above 1 trillion nanoparticles in mice overwhelmed Kupffer cell uptake rates, decreased liver clearance, prolonged circulation, and increased nanoparticle tumor delivery. This enabled up to 12% tumor delivery efficiency to 93% of cells in tumors, thereby boosting the therapeutic efficacy of Doxil \u00d2 . A study that administered cationic and ionizable lipid LNPs carrying siRNA to apoE \u00c0/\u00c0 mice demonstrated that hepatic uptake of ionizable, but not cationic, LNPs was apoE dependent. This observation suggests that LNP charge plays a role in LNP biodistribution [34]. Surface charge indeed controls organ-specific delivery [109]. A strategy called Selective ORgan Targeting (SORT) that adds a supplemental component (termed a SORT molecule) to the four conventional LNP lipids allowed LNPs to be systematically engineered to deliver nucleic acid therapies to the lungs, spleens, and livers of mice following i.v. administration. The SORT molecule varied from permanently positively charged ionizable lipids to negatively charged lipids. LNPs modified to include a significant mol% of permanently charged lipids sorted toward the lungs. Previous studies have shown that positively charged nanoparticles tend to accumulate in the lungs [110]. Additionally, highly positively charged particles generally aggregate in biological fluids and these agglomerates could accumulate in the narrow lung capillaries. Another explanation could be that the first highly vascularized organ that nanoparticles encounter after an i.v. tail vein injection is the lungs, in which blood flow is slower due to capillary circulation [110]. Thus, the nonspecific interactions between the negatively charged sulfated proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans displayed by the plasma membranes of capillary endothelial cells and the positively charged nanoparticles could trap the nanoparticles in the lungs [110]. Adding permanently negatively charged SORT molecules to LNPs directed them to the spleen, while the conventional (with close to neutral surface charge) LNPs homed to the liver. It may be that changes in the apparent pK a values endow distinct protein corona",

            "text": "Messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics have demonstrated significant potential in treating cancer, genetic disorders, and infectious diseases, as exemplified by the approval of COVID-19 mRNA or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccines [1][2][3][4]. A critical factor in their success is the use of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), which are among the most advanced and effective delivery systems for nucleic acid therapeutics. LNPs are formulated with a lipid mixture that usually includes an ionizable lipid, cholesterol, a phospholipid, and a polyethylene glycol (PEG)-lipid [5,6]. However, systemic administration of LNPs leads to predominant mRNA expression in the liver, highlighting the need for novel strategies capable of efficiently targeting extrahepatic tissues for therapeutic applications beyond liver-related diseases or vaccines [7][8][9]. \n\nSeveral approaches have been explored for achieving organ-specific mRNA-LNP delivery beyond the liver, focusing on passive (endogenous) and active (ligand-mediated or exogenous) targeting strategies [10]. Active targeting strategies rely on the addition of targeting ligands to the LNP surface, such as antibodies, peptides, or small molecules, to direct the LNP toward certain cell receptors [11]. Conversely, passive targeting depends on the meticulous design of LNPs, adjusting lipid ratios or incorporating additional lipids to promote the formation of a specific endogenous protein corona upon their introduction into the bloodstream. This protein corona effect has been attributed to different LNP properties such as size, apparent pKa, zeta potential, and PEGylation [12,13]. The passive targeting strategies are particularly promising, as they leverage a controlled structure without the need for additional ligands or modifications, hence reducing costs and regulatory hurdles and simplifying the scale-up process [14]. \n\nA well-established approach for passive targeting involves adding a fifth permanently charged lipid-cationic for lung targeting or anionic for spleen targeting-to enable selective organ targeting (SORT) [15,16]. However, this strategy has resulted in limited protein expression levels in targeted organs, indicating potential for further optimization.",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have emerged as a viable, clinically-validated platform for the delivery of mRNA therapeutics. LNPs have been utilized as mRNA delivery systems for applications including vaccines, gene therapy, and cancer immunotherapy. However, LNPs, which are typically composed of ionizable lipids, cholesterol, helper lipids, and lipid-anchored polyethylene glycol, often traffic to the liver which limits the therapeutic potential of the platform. Several approaches have been proposed to resolve this tropism such as post-synthesis surface modification or the addition of synthetic cationic lipids. Methods: Here, we present a strategy for achieving extrahepatic delivery of mRNA involving the incorporation of bile acids, a naturally-occurring class of cholesterol analogs, during LNP synthesis. We synthesized a series of bile acid-containing C14-4 LNPs by replacing cholesterol with bile acids (cholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid, deoxycholic acid, or lithocholic acid) at various ratios. Results: Bile acid-containing LNPs (BA-LNPs) were able to reduce delivery to liver cells in vitro and improve delivery in a variety of other cell types, including T cells, B cells, and epithelial cells. Our subsequent in vivo screening of selected LNP candidates injected intraperitoneally or intravenously identified a highly spleen tropic BA-LNP: CA-100, a four-component LNP containing cholic acid and no cholesterol. These screens also identified BA-LNP candidates demonstrating promise for other mRNA therapeutic applications such as for gastrointestinal or immune cell delivery. We further found that the substitution of cholic acid for cholesterol in an LNP formulation utilizing a different ionizable lipid, C12-200, also shifted mRNA delivery from the liver to the spleen, suggesting that this cholic acid replacement strategy may be generalizable. Conclusion: These results demonstrate the potential of a four-component BA-LNP formulation, CA-100, for extrahepatic mRNA delivery that could potentially be utilized for a range of therapeutic and vaccine applications.",

            "text": "Our study showed that liver-derived cell models demonstrated greater sensitivity to endosomal disruption from MC3-LNPs than non-liver cell models without equivalent differences in the level of particle uptake, providing a more detailed understanding to the observation by Sayers et al. that LNPs are differently effective in liver-derived Huh7 compared to lung-derived NCI-H358 47 . Examination of a wider range of LNP formulations and cationic lipids will be important to determine whether this is an intrinsic sensitivity of these cell models to nanoparticle delivery or whether this is indicative of a composition-driven LNP selectivity for certain cell types. Similarly, integrating the mCherry-GAL9 into a broader range of cellular models will be important for screening particle formulations for the identification of parameters important for selective uptake to ultimately facilitate selective organ targeting in vivo. \n\nBy improving our understanding of LNP characteristics that are critical to achieve particle uptake and endosomal escape across cellular models, we can ideally achieve therapeutic doses using lower amounts of potentially immunogenic lipid carriers and reduce the costs for future potential treatments. Identification of novel particle formulations will undoubtably require considerable efforts to screen nanoparticle variations in a robust manner, we believe this assay forms a fundamental basis for future screening endeavours to progress the development of drug delivery systems.",

The current state of the art for therapeutic nucleic acid delivery is lipid nanoparticles (LNP), which are composed of cholesterol, a helper lipid, a PEGylated lipid and an ionizable amine-containing lipid. The liver is the primary organ of LNP accumulation following intravenous administration and is also observed to varying degrees following intramuscular and subcutaneous routes. Delivery of nucleic acid to hepatocytes by LNP has therapeutic potential, but there are many disease indications that would benefit from non-hepatic LNP tissue and cell population targeting, such as cancer, and neurological, cardiovascular and infectious diseases. This review will concentrate on the current efforts to develop the next generation of tissue-targeted LNP constructs for therapeutic nucleic acids.",

            "text": "We did not observe statistically significant changes in weight in LNP-treated mice compared to PBS (phosphate-buffered saline)-treated mice (SI Appendix, Fig. S4B). As a control, we included two unencapsulated DNA barcodes, which should not enter cells as readily as DNA barcodes contained within LNPs; as expected, the counts of these negative controls were low (Fig. 2B). \n\nWhen we quantified the percentage of tdTomato + cells in all live cells isolated from the tissues, we were surprised to observe that LNPs formulated with cationic cholesterols and neutral helper lipids robustly delivered mRNA to the liver (Fig. 2C). As a control, we found that LNPs formulated with neutral cholesterol and cationic helper lipids detargeted the liver as previously reported (18)(19)(20). The difference in liver delivery was not likely driven by overall LNP potency since both libraries showed similar lung delivery (Fig. 2C). Given the unexpected liver delivery with (+ 0) LNPs, we compared delivery in five cell types isolated from the liver. We found a significant increase in delivery, relative to (0 +) LNPs, across all hepatic cells (Fig. 2D and SI Appendix, Fig. S5A). We performed the same analysis in the lung and found that Fig. 1. Four libraries containing LNPs with varied charge of cholesterol or helper lipid formed small and stable LNPs. (A and B) LNPs were formulated at eight different mole ratios of the four components by varying nine helper lipids and three cholesterols, creating 216 LNPs in total. (C) LNPs in each library (gray) formed small (50 to 200 nm) LNPs with the pool diameter (purple) being in the range of the pooled LNPs from each library, indicating no LNP aggregation. The (0 +) library consisted of LNPs with significantly larger diameter. The reported diameters include all eight tested molar ratios.",

            "text": "The default accumulation site of LNPs is the liver, where they acquire apolipoprotein E (apoE) from the bloodstream, facilitating their uptake by hepatocytes through interaction with the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) [37,38]. Alternatively, LNPs can also be decorated with N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) ligands, which bind to the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) on hepatocytes, directing the nanoparticles through receptor-mediated endocytosis [37]. This dual approach maximizes therapeutic efficacy and minimizes off-target effects, offering a robust framework for liver-specific delivery of advanced LNP-based therapies. Nevertheless, commercial LNP formulations have primarily been used for intramuscular (IM) administration, such as in COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, targeting the liver. This narrow focus constrains their potential applications beyond livertargeted treatments. Targeting organs beyond the liver is critical due to the potential to enhance therapeutic efficacy for different diseases and reduce hepatic toxicity. LNPs can also concentrate therapeutic agents in targeted tissues by enabling organ-specific drug delivery. Siegwart et al. developed the Selective Organ Targeting (SORT) system, directing LNPs to the lung, spleen, and liver after intravenous (IV) administration [29] (Figure 2a). By introducing SORT molecules based on the four existing lipids mentioned above, the physicochemical properties of the nanoparticles are modulated. SORT molecules include cationic lipids for lung targeting, anionic lipids for spleen targeting, and ionizable amino lipids for liver targeting. These lipids interact with the traditional components, altering the nanoparticles' surface charge, hydrophobicity, and interaction with biological membranes. As a result, LNPs can engage with specific cellular receptors, promoting selective uptake by target cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis or enhanced membrane fusion. In recent advancements, they presented a gene editing approach based on the SORT system, achieving significant and long-lasting genome editing in lung stem cells after IV administrations [30].",

While RNA delivery has been an obstacle for decades, lipid-based delivery systems using cationic or ionizable lipids have recently been understood at greater depth [2][3][4][5] . \n\nIn recent years, significant progress has been made to overcome some of the obstacles associated with in vivo delivery of siRNA, and lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are very promising tools. LNPs have been specifically tested for hepatocyte delivery of siRNA molecules, since the liver is a well-perfused organ with a fenestrated endothelium. On the other hand, LNPs are known to interact with serum proteins, exchanging components and acquiring proteins in circulation that can potentially direct LNPs to specific cell types 6 . It is well-known that siRNA-loaded LNP absorb Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) on their surface, enhancing uptake into hepatoma cells and primary hepatocytes 6,7 . ApoE binds to the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), which is strongly expressed on the outer membrane of hepatocytes. In short, LNPs behave as neutral liposomes in circulation, acquiring ApoE and delivering siRNA to hepatocytes in a targeted manner. This mechanism of hepatocyte uptake of LNP via the LDLR route is the basis of the first FDA-approved siRNAbased drug, Patisiran, a medication for the treatment of polyneuropathy in people with hereditary transthyretinmediated amyloidiosis 8 . Patisiran is an siRNA, which targets hepatocytes and prevents the production of proteins, which do not fold correctly and thus accumulate in different parts of the body, including the central nervous system 9 . \n\nLiver cancer represents globally the second most common cause of cancer-related death and its incidence is rising dramatically 10 .",

On the basis of the size of the hydrophilic head group relative to the size of the hydrophobic tail or tails 114 , lipids form distinct structures including micelles, liposomes and LNPs (Fig. 2a). FDAapproved LNPs contain variations of four basic components: a cationic or ionizable lipid, cholesterol, a helper lipid, and a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-lipid (Fig. 2b,c). Scientists have investigated the structure of lipid-based delivery systems complexed with nucleic acid 115,116 and demonstrated that lipid structure alters how LNPs interact with cells 117 . Given that lipid structure influences delivery and that lipids can be easily synthesized using chemistries including Michael addition-based, epoxidebased and alcohol-based reactions, scientists have created libraries of dozens to thousands of chemically distinct lipid delivery systems 118,119 . Many of these efforts focused on improving siRNA delivery to hepatocytes in mice 120 . This work, along with a more rational approach to lipid design 117 , reduced the dose required for robust in vivo hepatocyte gene silencing in mice from approximately 1.0 mg/kg (reF. 121 ) to 0.002 mg/kg (reF. 122 ). Key lipids that delivered siRNA in non-human primates included C12-200, which was synthesized using epoxideamine chemistry 120 ; cKK-E12, a peptide-like lipid compound 122 ; DLin-KC2-DMA, an ionizable lipid identified using rational design 117 ; and DLin-MC3-DMA 123 , which was used in patisiran to treat hATTR 19 (Fig. 2c,d).\n\nLNPs have also delivered mRNA to the liver in mice, in non-human primates and in humans. In some cases, LNPs utilized lipids previously developed for siRNA delivery. For example, in mice, LNPs formulated with cKK-E12 124,125 , C12-200 126",

            "text": "Liver cancer, specifically hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths, following pancreatic cancer. The 5-year overall survival rate for HCC remains relatively low. Currently, there are multiple treatment options available for HCC, including systemic drugs, minimally invasive local therapies such as radiofrequency ablation, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), and arterial radioembolization (TARE), as well as surgical interventions like liver resection or transplantation. However, the effectiveness of drug delivery to the cancerous liver is hindered by pathophysiological changes in the organ. In order to address this challenge, lipid-based nanoparticles (LNPs) have emerged as promising platforms for delivering a diverse range of therapeutic drugs. LNPs offer various structural configurations that enhance their physical stability and enable them to accommodate different types of cargo with varying mechanical properties and degrees of hydrophobicity. In this article, we provide a comprehensive review of the current applications of LNPs in the development of anti-HCC therapies. By examining the existing research, we aim to shed light on the potential future directions and advancements in this field.",

            "text": "Similar classes of RNA vectors probably show the same tropism in vivo, for instance, most LNPs tend to deliver mRNA into the liver. Nonetheless, minimal alteration of chemical structures of vectors in the same class might also achieve the goal of targeting, and the research on exploring targeted material structures is in full swing. Beyond Dlin-MC3-DMA, ALC-0315, and SM-102 approved by FDA for clinical use in LNP formulations, numerous advancements have been made in the development of various lipids, lipidoids, and polymers for delivering RNA to targeted organs. Here, we outline the relationship between the chemical structures of these materials and their specific targeting capabilities for different organs (Figure 2). 3D, and identified the top-performing lipid, cKK-E12, via iterative screening and structure-activity relationships (SAR) study. As a result, cKK-E12 LNPs delivered siRNA to liver and silenced Phosphatase and tensin homolog (Pten) in hepatocytes with high selectivity (Figure 3E) [107]. Furthermore, cKK-E12 LNPs were also utilized to co-deliver Cas9 mRNA and sgRNA for editing PCSK9 in hepatocytes of mice in a subsequent study [103]. \n\nSimilarly, Whitehead and colleagues synthesized a series of lipidoids by Michael Addition for siRNA delivery. And subsequent investigation revealed that the lead 306Oi10 LNPs resulted in much higher siRNA accumulation in liver than naked siRNA [108]. \n\nCurrently, LNPs have been increasingly employed for loading mRNA to achieve liver targeting, and applications such as gene editing and protein replacement are explored [109,110]. The mechanism underlying the liver-targeting of LNPs has been extensively studied and several findings are publicized. Upon entry into the body, LNPs can interact with proteins in the biological environment and adsorb proteins on the membrane surface to form the protein corona [55,111].",

            "text": "The effect of cationic lipid DOTAP's proportion in LNPs on the biodistribution of nanoparticles is intriguing, as described in Cheng et al. (2020). For example, LNPs devoid of DOTAP accumulated in the liver; LNPs having a DOTAP content of 10%-15% predominantly ended up in the spleen, whereas with an increase in the DOTAP content above 50%, the LNPs were detectable almost exclusively in lungs. A similar change of the organ showing the highest accumulation (liver, spleen, or lungs) when the proportion of a cationic lipid was increased was documented for other cationic helper lipids: DDAB (dimethyl-dioctadecylammonium bromide) and EPC. \n\nThe use of an anionic helper lipid leads to the accumulation of LNPs in the spleen after intravenous administration (Alvarez-Benedicto et al., 2022;Luozhong et al., 2022;Gomi et al., 2023). In Luozhong et al. (2022), it was found that when 1,2-dioleoyl-snglycero-3-phospho-L-serine (DOPS) served as the anionic lipid, aside from the accumulation of LNPs in the spleen, their specific accumulation was registered in superficial cervical lymph nodes, in contrast to LNPs containing phosphatidic acid. Authors of Gomi et al. (2023). demonstrated that phosphatidylserine-containing LNPs are mainly taken up by hepatic phagocytes. In this context, the presence of an ionizable lipid in the LNPs enhanced the uptake of the nanoparticles by cells. It is worth mentioning that specific delivery of phosphatidylserine-containing LNPs to lymphoid organs was achieved there only with intravenous administration. \n\nAs stated above, targeted delivery of LNPs to organs is determined by the charge, not by the nature of the polar group in a helper lipid.",

Employing immunodeficient mice may be justified for studying the effects of low molecular weight drugs in human tumors. However, it is crucial to consider that with more complex systems like nanomedicines, the possibility of missing critical interactions with the immune system could outweigh the advantages of using human tumor models compared to syngeneic tumors (Jones et al., 2013;La-Beck and Gabizon, 2017;Shmeeda et al., 2016;Rios-Doria et al., 2015). \n\nThe ineffectiveness of the liposomes and dextran sulfate pretreatments to improve siRNA-LNP pharmacokinetics suggests that these pre-treatments are not universally beneficial in preventing nanoparticle clearance. Future research could shift focus from RES blockade strategies to developing long-circulating particles, such as PEG-DSG LNPs, that retain the transfection efficiency of short-circulating particles like PEG-DMG LNPs. Additionally, future studies could evaluate which liver cell types are reached by the liposomes compared to the LNPs. Further research is needed to better understand the molecular mechanisms involved in LNP clearance and to develop tailored pretreatment strategies that specifically block key receptors, potentially leading to a more favorable pharmacokinetic profile and tumor accumulation. Implementing RES transient blockade could enhance LNPbased cancer therapies, aligning with precision medicine goals to maximize tumor efficacy and minimize toxicity.",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), based on ionizable lipids, are the most commonly used messenger RNA (mRNA) delivery vectors and play a crucial role in the research and clinical translation of mRNA therapy. By encapsulating mRNA within a lipid core, LNPs safeguard against mRNA degradation, enhance cellular uptake, and facilitate cytoplasmic release upon cellular entry [1]. Notably, LNPs boast an excellent drug-loading capacity, high encapsulation efficiency, sustained release, high stability, low toxicity, and enhanced efficacy. Currently, LNPs are the best choice for delivering nucleic acids. To date, three nucleic acid medicines based on LNPs have been approved. Patisiran, based on DLin-MC3-DMA lipids, is an RNA interference therapeutic drug used for treating hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (hATTR amyloidosis) [2]. BNT162b2, which is based on ALC-0315 lipids, and mRNA-1273, which is based on SM-102 lipids, are mRNA vaccines used to prevent COVID-19 [3,4]. These applications demonstrate the success of LNP delivery systems for gene drugs and vaccines. \n\nThe momentum of preclinical research and clinical trials for mRNA-LNP drugs is on the rise. However, the current focus predominantly on liver delivery results in a prevalence of liver-targeted delivery among LNPs. DLin-MC3-DMA (MC3) LNPs are the most representative vector for liver-targeted delivery. Both SM-102 and ALC-0315 are MC3 LNPs that primarily deliver mRNA to the liver after intravenous injection [5]. However, LNPs for extrahepatic-targeted mRNA delivery are still in the early stages of development. \n\nTo fully utilize the advantages of mRNA technology, such as its low cost, high efficiency, and short developmental cycles, the development of an extrahepatic-targeted delivery strategy for mRNA-LNPs is of great significance. Current research is focused on enhancing the accuracy of mRNA-LNP delivery to specific cells, tissues, or organs to improve the therapeutic effect and minimize potential side-effects.",

LNPs are highly suitable for delivering nucleic acids due to their exceptional biocompatibility, biodegradability, low toxicity, and immunogenicity, as well as their structural adaptability and ease of large-scale manufacturing [20]. The resurgence of gene therapy has led to a significant uptake of LNPs as carriers for RNA molecules [21]. \n\nWhile LNPs offer numerous benefits, a key hurdle in developing LNP-based gene therapies is devising efficient tissue-specific delivery methods. Traditionally, targeting strategies involve attaching ligands for specific receptors onto the nanoparticle surface. One promising targeting approach involves linking a multivalent N-Acetyl-D-galactosamine (GalNac) cluster to LNPs. These modified nanoparticles have shown effective mRNA delivery to liver cells, successfully treating genetic disorders in mouse models [22]. Notably, LNPs comprising an ionizable cationic lipid, a phospholipid, cholesterol, and a polyethylene glycol (PEG)-lipid are enveloped by host apolipoprotein E (ApoE) in circulation, facilitating their uptake into liver cells through low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR)-mediated endocytosis [22][23][24].",

            "text": "LNPs containing ionizable lipids have been studied for the systemic delivery of RNA therapeutics, but designing nanoparticles that can be delivered to target tissues beyond the liver remains challenging [38]. Most of the currently studied LNPs show affinity for the liver because it is a well-perfused organ that can take up intravenously injected cargo, and the slow blood flow and sinusoidal vasculature of the liver also play a role in aiding LNP distribution [39,40]. In addition, neutrally charged LNPs that enter the bloodstream bind to apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which is taken up through low-density lipoprotein receptors distributed in the liver [41]. Thus, neutral LNPs can rapidly accumulate in the liver without using ligands for molecules overexpressed by hepatocytes. Even if the LNP surface is PEGylated, it has been reported that PEGylated lipids and ApoE proteins are exchanged after injection into the bloodstream [42]. \n\nThe challenge in expanding the use of LNPs is evolving them to have different tropisms in vivo [39]. Attempts have been made to modulate the surface charge of LNPs in order to deliver drugs to organs other than the liver. Lung-specific mRNA delivery has been achieved by increasing the proportion of persistent cationic lipids in LNPs; conversely, spleen-specific mRNA distribution has been observed when the surface negative charge is high [32]. \n\nThe method of reducing the diameter of the nanoparticles for tumor penetration has also been studied. Using a microfluidic mixing technique, siRNA-LNPs with sizes of less than 50 nm were prepared and efficiently invaded the tumor microenvironment [20]. In another study, improved penetration into diseased tissues, such as tumors, was observed using LNPs with a diameter of 30 nm [18]. Recently, it was shown that LNPs as small as 20 nm in diameter can be produced by increasing the PEGylation ratio using microfluidic technology. These small LNPs are applicable not only to tumors but also to metastatic lymph nodes.",

            "text": "The currently available lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) work very well for vaccines. Indeed, there is some evidence that the LNPs may act as an adjuvant by stimulating local inflammatory signaling. Whereas this low level of inflammatory signaling can enhance the action of a vaccine, it is not desirable for treating chronic disease. Furthermore, LNPs are largely sequestered in the liver and spleen when delivered systemically. This feature may be useful in treating hepatic disease but is not desirable for treating other organs. \n\nAccordingly, substantial effort is now being directed toward improving LNPs by reducing toxicity and improving tissue distribution. In this regard, we have developed leukosomes, which are LNPs with membrane proteins of autologous leukocytes embedded within the outer membrane of the LNP. Biodistribution studies indicate that leukosomes are preferentially incorporated at sites of inflammation. We have shown that the leukosomes are superior to standard LNPs in delivering therapeutic cargo to atheromatous lesions in the apo E deficient hypercholesterolemic mouse. 35 Another approach is to label the external surface of the LNP with a targeting antibody. An example of this method was strikingly demonstrated by the Epstein group, who labeled LNPs with an antibody directed against T cells to deliver mRNA encoding a chimeric antigen receptor against activated fibroblasts. 36 n a preclinical model of cardiac fibrosis, this LNP cargo generated CAR-T cells that diminished the number of activated fibroblasts in the heart, reduced cardiac fibrosis, and improved cardiac function.",

The key to fulfilling this potential is the safe and efficacious delivery of shortinterfering RNAs (siRNAs), the molecules that mediate RNAi, to specific cell types and tissues. In recent years, significant progress has been made to overcome some of the obstacles associated with in vivo delivery of siRNA, and lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) represent one of the most advanced technological platforms. 1 Earlier work has established that siRNAs formulated in LNPs can successfully silence therapeutically relevant genes in nonhuman primates, 2,3 and a class of LNPs, termed \"stable nucleic acid lipid particles\", is being utilized in multiple liver-targeted RNAi programs in human clinical trials. More recently, we reported the discovery of novel ionizable 4 and cationic 5 lipids with significantly improved activity for next generation LNP-siRNA delivery systems. The discovery of both ionizable and cationic classes of lipids that mediate efficient LNP delivery of siRNA warrants the distinction of ionizable LNPs (iLNPs) and cationic LNPs (cLNPs).\n\nThe relative success of LNPs for liver delivery of siRNA molecules can, at least in part, be attributed to the favorable physiology of the liver, a well-perfused organ with a fenestrated endothelium. On the other hand, LNPs are known to interact with serum proteins, exchanging components and acquiring proteins in circulation that can potentially direct LNPs to specific cell types. 6,7 Apolipoproteins, for instance, were found to be generally adsorbed onto neutral liposomes, but only apolipoprotein E (apoE) was capable of enhancing uptake into hepatoma cells and primary hepatocytes. 8 More recently, Yan et al. have described the role of apoE in the clearance of neutral liposomes by hepatocytes in vivo. 9 ApoE is found on ch",

            "text": "Lipid Nanoparticles (LNPs) recently emerged as an invaluable RNA delivery platform. With many LNP\u2010based therapeutics in the pre\u2010clinical and clinical pipelines, there is extensive research dedicated to improving LNPs. These efforts focus mainly on the tolerability and transfectability of new ionizable lipids and RNAs, or modulating LNPs biodistribution with active targeting strategies. However, most formulations follow the well\u2010established lipid proportions used in clinically approved products. Nevertheless, investigating the effects of LNPs composition on their biodistribution can expand the toolbox for particle design, leading to improved delivery strategies. Herein, a new LNPs (30\u2010n\u2010LNPs) formulation with increasing amounts of phospholipids is investigated as a possible mRNA delivery system for treating Inflammatory Bowel Diseases. Compared to LNPs with benchmark composition (b\u2010LNPs), n\u2010LNPs containing 30% distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC) are well tolerated following intravenous administration and display natural targeting toward the inflamed colon in dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)\u2010colitis bearing mice, while de\u2010targeting clearing organs such as the liver and spleen. Using interleukin\u201010\u2010encoding mRNA as therapeutic cargo, n\u2010LNPs demonstrated a reduction of pathological burden in colitis\u2010bearing mice. n\u2010LNPs represent a starting point to further investigate the influence of LNPs composition on systemic biodistribution, ultimately opening new therapeutic modalities in different pathologies.",

            "text": "As stated above, targeted delivery of LNPs to organs is determined by the charge, not by the nature of the polar group in a helper lipid. For instance, for nanoparticles containing anionic phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylglycerol, or phosphatidic acid, researchers have observed more specific delivery to the spleen (60%, 50%, and 75%, respectively) than to the liver (20%, 45%, and 5%, respectively) (LoPresti et al., 2022). On the other hand, another group of authors (Pattipeiluhu et al., 2022) has reported that for LNPs containing phosphatidylglycerol, accumulation in the liver occurs predominantly in sinusoidal endothelial cells and Kupffer cells, in contrast to phosphatidylcholine-containing LNPs, whose accumulation takes place equally in hepatocytes, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, and Kupffer cells. \n\nThe introduction of an additional charged helper lipid as a fifth component also enables investigators to alter targeting efficiency of LNPs. Not so long ago (Dilliard et al., 2021), scientists achieved almost 100% reporter mRNA expression in the liver, spleen, or lungs by means of an additional neutral, negatively, or positively charged lipid, respectively. Targeting to an organ depended there on apparent pK a of nanoparticles: at pK a < 5, the particles accumulated mainly in the spleen; at pK a of 6.2-6.4, mainly in the liver; whereas at pK a > 11, mainly in lungs. It is noteworthy that at pK a of 6.5-11, there was selective distribution of LNPs into the lungs and spleen at different levels, indicating a nonobvious dependence of the LNP biodistribution on the charge. It is likely that pK a can serve as a good predictor of bioactivity. For classic fourcomponent LNPs, apparent pK a was 6.3-6.6 in the above study, depending on the ionizable cationic lipid used.",

Therapeutics based on siRNA offer the prospect to open up a vast array of novel drug targets for pharmacological inhibition. However, efficient delivery of macromolecular siRNA to the cytosol of target cells is challenging. Diverse delivery strategies have been explored, including viruses 1,2 , lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) 3 , and ligand-conjugated siRNAs 4,5 . \n\nPatisiran, an LNP-formulated siRNA targeting transthyretin (TTR) in the liver, was recently the first siRNA therapeutic to be approved for clinical use. LNPs preferentially target the liver, where the fenestrated endothelium enables extravasation and endocytosis by hepatic cells 6,7 . How siRNA exits the endosome and enters the cytosol, a process referred to as endosomal escape, has long been poorly understood. Lately, progress has been made in the elucidation of lipid-mediated endosomal escape of siRNA. Electron microscopy studies of liver tissues suggested that LNPs mediate siRNA release in the early stages of the endosomal system 8 . In addition, an endogenous family of \u03b2-galactoside-binding lectins-galectins-were shown to respond to endosomal membrane disruption and rapidly relocate to damaged vesicles during lipid-mediated endosomal escape, making detailed characterization of the process possible 9 . Lipids induce release of the siRNA payload in a narrow \"window of opportunity\" during the endosomal maturation process, after formation of early endosomes but before the siRNA reaches mature lysosomes, characterized by the lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) 9 . \n\nEfficient targeting of LNPs to extra-hepatic tissues has turned out to be challenging. To reach tissues without fenestrated endothelium, and in particular tumors, non-particulate siRNA formulations would be advantageous.",

            "text": "This LNP selectively adsorbs plasma proteins following intravenous injection and specifically edits liver macrophages to enhance phagocytosis and initiate immune responses within tumors, thereby effectively halting the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma [131]. As a pivotal nanocarrier system, LNPs offer numerous advantages, including a simple structure, versatile compositions, and notable benefits [132][133][134][135]. The efficiency of drug loading and targeted release is influenced by the adjustment of lipid composition and structure, which enhances drug bioavailability and efficacy. LNPs also exhibit excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability, rarely causing immune or toxic reactions. Despite the widespread use of LNPs in drug delivery, especially in gene therapy and vaccine development, their immunogenicity remains a concern. LNP formulations, particularly those used for mRNA vaccines, have been shown to trigger inflammatory responses. These immune responses can vary based on the composition of the lipids, with some ionizable lipids being more immunogenic than others [136]. Modifying lipid structures or incorporating additional excipients to reduce immunogenicity is an ongoing area of research aimed at improving the clinical safety profile of LNP-based therapies [137]. Targeting can be improved by modifying surfactants or lipid molecules, reducing drug toxicity to normal tissues, and enhancing therapeutic effectiveness. The size, shape, and surface properties of LNPs can be precisely tailored to meet various drug requirements through adjustments in formulation and processing conditions. Recent advancements in LNP technology have focused on the development of new lipid materials to enhance stability and functionality. For instance, the incorporation of ionizable lipids in LNPs has dramatically improved the efficiency of nucleic acid delivery by facilitating endosomal escape. Additionally, functionalizing the LNP surface with targeting ligands, such as peptides or antibodies, enables precise targeting of specific cell types, further enhancing therapeutic potential. PEGylation (the attachment of polyethylene glycol chains) is another widely used strategy to extend the circulation time of LNPs in vivo by reducing their recognition by the immune system [138].",

            "text": "PEG-lipids reduce aggregation of the LNPs and prolong the circulation time of the particles once administered. The molar ratio at which the lipid components are mixed is not uniform across mRNA therapeutic products and may impact the biological activity of the drug product. Roces et al. demonstrated that altering the lipid molar ratios impacts both size and zeta potential of the LNPs [200]. These characteristics of the LNP impact the biodistribution and immunogenicity of the drug product and should therefore be optimized according to the application. Studies evaluating lipid-based systems administered through subcutaneous and intramuscular injection have shown clear effects of the size on their uptake [201,202]. \n\nA study originating from Moderna demonstrated that LNP sizes between 60 and 150 nm were found to produce strong immune responses in non-human primates [201]. Thus, immunotherapeutic mRNA LNP products are likely to be produced within this range [201]. \n\nAs previously established, administration of LNPs through intravenous and intramuscular methods leads to non-specific accumulation of the particles in the liver [203]. Consequently, this accumulation may lead to side effects of the vaccine including hepatic inflammation and hepatic necrosis [204], and could limit access for patients with preexisting inflammatory conditions [205]. The ability to redirect mRNA LNP therapeutics to their target tissue is therefore critical in order to reduce off-target effects [206]. Further work to improve the distribution of LNPs to target-specific tissues is ongoing [207]. Most prominently, selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles, developed by Cheng et al., demonstrated that supplementing currently established LNP compositions with specified percentages of charged molecules can alter tissue tropism [208]. Furthermore, the spleen has been shown to be effectively targeted through the use of mRNA coated lipoplexes by adjusting the charge ratio (lipid to RNA) to 1.3:2 [209]. Coating strategies for mRNA LNPs have also been explored [210], including new avenues being PEG coatings for redirection of other nanoparticles from the liver to the target tissue [211,212].",

This remarkable potential of siRNA makes it a useful candidate, and it has been successively used in the treatment of diseases, including cancer. However, certain properties of siRNA such as its large size and susceptibility to degradation by RNases are major drawbacks of using this technology at the broader scale. To overcome these challenges, there is a requirement for versatile tools for safe and efficient delivery of siRNA to its target site. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been extensively explored to this end, and this paper reviews different types of LNPs, namely liposomes, solid lipid NPs, nanostructured lipid carriers, and nanoemulsions, to highlight this delivery mode. The materials and methods of preparation of the LNPs have been described here, and pertinent physicochemical properties such as particle size, surface charge, surface modifications, and PEGylation in enhancing the delivery performance (stability and specificity) have been summarized. We have discussed in detail various challenges facing LNPs and various strategies to overcome biological barriers to undertake the safe delivery of siRNA to a target site. We additionally highlighted representative therapeutic applications of LNP formulations with siRNA that may offer unique therapeutic benefits in such wide areas as acute myeloid leukaemia, breast cancer, liver disease, hepatitis B and COVID-19 as recent examples.",

As passive targeting with lipid nanoparticle is a vast subject in itself, in this review we will discuss the types of lipids to use, as well a their proportions, in order to deliver gene therapies to specific organs, especiall extrahepatic ones. By manipulating the composition of lipids (Figure 2) and their proportion in LNPs, it is possible to change their size and surface characteristics. Indeed, the size and charge of LNPs seem to have significant effects on their biodistribution. Therefore, the delivery of the LNPs can be more specific to certain organs. Unfortunately, we still do not clearly understand the precise mechanism that explains the relationship between the biodistribution of LNPs and their size, charge, and the types of lipids used. It would therefore be interesting to conduct fundamental research on this mechanism.

In particular, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and Kupffer cells take up a large proportion of nanoparticles after systemic administration, decreasing their circulation time. To reduce nanovehicle capture, Saunders et al. 115 designed a liposome with a highly negative surface charge (\u00c099.4 mV) and large size (259 nm). After intravenous injection, liposomes with these unique physicochemical properties transiently occupied the MPS and thus decreased the uptake of siRNA-loaded LNPs by Kupffer cells and LSECs, prolonging their retention in blood. Ultimately, through the action of a nanoprimer, LNPs carrying human erythropoietin (hEPO) mRNA or factor VII (FVII) siRNA increased hEPO production (by 32%) or enhanced FVII silencing (by 49%).",

The mRNA-LNPs were approximately 100 nm in diameter and had a polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.2-0.25 (Figure 2C), measured using Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS. TPO mRNA-LNP mediated a highly efficient transfection of HEK293T cells, which resulted in abundant TPO secretion (Figure 2D). To examine the duration and biodistribution of protein production by mRNA-LNPs in vivo, 0.5 mg/kg luciferase mRNA-LNPs were administered into mice by intravenous (i.v.) and intramuscular (i.m.) injections. The i.v. administration resulted in mRNA-LNPs being delivered to the liver, while the i.m. route targeted both the liver and the injection site (Figure 2E). In the liver, luciferase mRNA was translated, and a strong bioluminescence signal was recorded in the first 24 h after injection. Translation rate decreased quickly in the liver, showing an approximately 10-fold decrease per day. Quantification of luminescence values indi-cated that i.v. delivery is far more efficient than i.m. delivery. However, protein expression in the muscle decayed slowly and tended to last longer (Figures 2E and 2F).",

(2022), it was found that complete replacement of a zwitterionic helper lipid with an anionic one induces greater accumulation of LNPs in the spleen as compared to the liver, whereas replacement with a cationic helper lipid leads to LNP accumulation in lungs. It must be noted that the nature of the helper lipid in that report did not have as much influence on nanoparticle biodistribution as did the charge of the lipid's polar head. \n\nIn Cheng et al. (2020); LoPresti et al. ( 2022); Radmand et al. (2023), it has been convincingly proven that the use of a cationic helper lipid drives the accumulation of LNPs in lungs. Besides, in Radmand et al. (2023); Kauffman et al. (2018), it has been demonstrated that the greatest accumulation of LNPs occurs in endothelial cells, which are most accessible to the bloodstream. The effect of cationic lipid DOTAP's proportion in LNPs on the biodistribution of nanoparticles is intriguing, as described in Cheng et al. (2020).",

            "text": "Many diseases can affect the liver. Among them, tyrosinemia [104,105] and autoimmune hepatitis [106] are very severe diseases. Fortunately, LNP delivery to the liver is very effective. It is enhanced by the biological effect of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) [107,108]. After LNPs are injected intravenously, ApoE forms a corona around the particles. Since ApoE binds specifically to receptors on hepatocytes, it directs LNPs towards the liver. This explains why LNPs are more easily trapped by the liver [108]. In addition, the liver can be used as a protein factory [109] to treat various rare diseases through gene therapy. As the liver is an excellent therapeutic target, it is important to optimize delivery to this organ. \n\nPatisiran (ONPATTRO\u2122) is the first RNA drug delivered by LNPs that has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [107]. This LNP is composed of DLin-MC3-DMA/DSPC/cholesterol/DMG-PEG at a molar ratio of 50:10:38.5:1.5 [110]. As it was the first to be approved, this formulation inspired the composition of other LNPs. Table 4 presents some formulations that target the liver. \n\nLiu et al. [22] obtained impressive results. When delivering LNPs with Cas9 mRNA, along with a sgRNA targeting PCSK9, they succeeded in reducing the serum PCSK9 by 80%. They used the following formulation: BAMEA-16B/DOPE/cholesterol/DSPE-PEG (16/4/8/1 w:w). They used a lipid:mRNA ratio of 15:1 (w:w). Their LNP had a size of 230 nm. Fortunately, they observed no signs of inflammation and no obvious hepatocellular injury. Rothgangl et al. [113] have obtained important results.",

            "text": "L ipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are clinically relevant delivery systems that have delivered mRNA-based COVID vaccines after intramuscular administration, 1,2 mRNA and single-guide RNA 3,4 to hepatocytes after intravenous administration, and siRNA to hepatocytes after intravenous administration. 5 These data justify the exploration of LNPs that target nonliver tissues. 6 Scientists use three approaches to increase nonliver mRNA delivery. One is to pretreat animals with drugs that block the liver from taking up LNPs 7 or reduce the activity of mRNA once it reaches hepatocytes. 8,9 A second is to add active targeting ligands to nanoparticles. 10 For example, mRNA-loaded LNPs were targeted to Ly6c + leukocytes utilizing antibodies that were anchored into the lipid membrane. 11 In another example, plasmalemma vesicleassociated protein-targeting LNPs were covalently conjugated with antibodies, which increased lung protein expression. 12 A third approach is to change the chemical composition of the LNP. Clinical LNPs have consisted of four components: an ionizable or cationic lipid, a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-lipid, a cholesterol, and a helper lipid. For example, when a cationic helper lipid was added to a liver-targeting LNP, it was redirected to lung endothelial cells. 13 In another example, RNA-lipoplexes were targeted to lymphoid-resident dendritic cells by titrating negative charge. 14 Finally, a fifth charged molecule was added to the LNP, improving tropism to the spleen and lung. 15 Notably, authors subsequently reported that these LNPs can bind different serum proteins, providing an insight into the biology of delivery. 16 These studies led us to hypothesize that changing the helper lipid could affect the internal cellular response to LNPs in vivo. \n\nWe first confirmed helper lipid-dependent tropism. We used a functional in vivo mRNA and DNA barcode system 17\u221220 to evaluate how 18 helper lipids affected tropism to 19 cell types in vivo.",

            "text": "LNP formulations primarily target hepatic tissues when systemically administered. Because of this inherent advantage, the first clinical trials for both LNP\u2212siRNA and LNP\u2212Cas9 mRNA delivery target a liver-related genetic disease. However, additional lipids have been incorporated into LNPs to achieve extrahepatic delivery in mice. The overall charge and size of the LNPs determine their biodistribution in vivo. For example, LNPs containing novel degradable ionizable lipids can facilitate splenic delivery and transfect B lymphocytes. 41 The addition of a negatively charged lipid (18PA) can also result in spleen targeting. 76 Lung specificity can be achieved in formulations with PEG-lipids at 7 mol % that encapsulate mRNA. 45,46 igand conjugation of lipids can further achieve target specificity in in vitro in multiple cell lines 69 including those representing cancer cells, 87 as well as in lung tumors in vivo. 67 ddition of permanently cationic lipids in SORT can also achieve delivery to the lung, spleen and liver. 76 Nanoparticle size is another important factor in determining the biodistribution of LNPs after intravenous injections. Nanoparticles that are less than 10 nm in diameter may be removed by the kidneys via the glomerular capillaries whereas those larger than 200 nm will activate the complement system and are removed from the blood, accumulating in the liver and spleen. 96,97 However, LNPs of \u2264150 nm in size are capable of escaping fenestrated capillaries in the liver. 97 LNP formulations of an appropriate size are necessary to achieve optimum CRISPR/Cas9 delivery and subsequent genome editing efficiency. Particle size further plays a role in colloidal formulation stability. Ultimately, the overall charge, particle size, lipid ratio, and receptor-mediated ligand or antibody conjugations emphasize the versatility of LNPs as a delivery platform suitable for gene therapy that can achieve desired target specificity in vivo. \n\nThe format of LNP-encapsulated cargo also plays a role in determining the most suitable approach to CRISPR/Cas9 delivery.",

            "text": "PEGylated lipids, or PEG-lipids, represent important components that are usually located on the surface of the LNPs. PEG-lipids consist of a hydrophilic molecule of PEG conjugated to a hydrophobic alkyl (or lipid) chain, where the PEG domain is attached to the LNP surface while the alkyl chain is attached to the LNP bilayer. The incorporation of PEGylated lipids in LNPs is known to extend the circulation time of LNPs due to their steric barrier effect. This property reduces binding of LNPs to plasma proteins (opsonins), reduces rapid elimination by the reticuloendothelial system, and consequently, assists in the accumulation of the nanoparticles at disease sites [25,49]. In addition, the steric barrier properties of PEGylated lipids may prevent fusion or aggregation of nanoparticles during manufacturing, and this would result in a homogenous formulation with a small particle size (50-100 nm) and narrow polydispersity index [25]. \n\nThe amount of PEGylated lipids incorporated in LNPs should be controlled carefully and kept to a minimum. Having higher PEG contents usually increases the residence time of LNPs in the blood circulation but may prevent their fusion with the endosomal bilayer and hinder the intracellular delivery of nucleic acids [68,69]. Therefore, a reduction in PEG content from 10% to about 1.5% (along with increasing the ionizable lipids to 57%) produced a marked improvement in the potency of mRNA-based LNPs as reported by Semple et al. [64]. Moreover, monitoring the size of PEG-lipids attached to the LNPs can be used to control the rate at which the PEG-lipids diffuse away from the nanoparticles and affect the residence time in blood circulation. Larger lipid anchors are usually used in formulating liposomes that circulate for longer duration in the blood to deliver chemotherapeutic drugs [70]. On the other hand, smaller lipid anchors are used in developing LNPs that favor shorter residence times to deliver siRNA to hepatocytes [71].",

However, most injected lipid nanovehicles (w80%) are delivered to the liver. Therefore, some strategies have been developed to modulate the physicochemical properties of lipid nanovehicles and have shown increased spleen tropism. Indeed, the incorporation of cholesterol increased the rigidity of the lipid bilayer 162 , thereby promoting its uptake into the spleen 163 . In addition, Kranz et al. 164 prepared a series of lipoplexes with different charge ratios (i.e., different cationic lipid: RNA ratios) without targeting ligands. They observed that gene expression was decreased in the lung and increased in the spleen as the cationic lipid: RNA ratio was gradually decreased, suggesting that the charge ratio may play a crucial role in organ-specific gene expression. Similarly, a recent study reported that adding anionic lipids and the modulation of their molar ratio facilitated a change in the tissue tropism of LNPs, showing reduced delivery rates to the liver and higher delivery rates to the spleen 165 .",

Recently, they have gained significant interest, mainly due to the widespread use of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, which would not have been possible without LNP-based mRNA delivery. While many challenges remain in the development of safe and effective LNP-based drug delivery systems, further studies are needed to deepen our understanding of biological and chemical factors prior to broad clinical application. However, researchers assume that targeted delivery systems, such as LNPs, are likely to increase the efficacy and reduce side effects of existing therapies, e.g., immunotherapy, mRNA-based cancer vaccines or CAR therapy [22,26]. \n\nFrom our perspective, major challenges regarding the clinical implementation of LNPs in lung cancer treatment are (1) identifying the target and determining druggability, (2) predicting the quality and stability of LNPs, and (3) enabling specific tissue targeting and tumor penetration. \n\nOverall, however, we believe that LNPs have the potential to become an essential drug delivery system, overcome limitations of traditional therapeutic reagents and open new avenues for translational nanomedicine in lung cancer treatment.",

When in the circulation, some types of LNPs bind to serum proteins, including apolipoprotein E, which, in turn, binds to the lowdensity lipoprotein receptor. This receptor is highly expressed on hepatocytes and directs the LNP siRNA into these cells. 34,35 However, a fraction of the LNP siRNA is taken up by Kupffer cells, sinusoidal endothelial cells, and stellate cells, resulting in a significant amount of siRNA not accumulating in hepatocytes. 36 This can be largely avoided by changing the lipid composition in the LNP siRNAs; e.g., by using appropriate cationic aminolipids. 37 In the present study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of LNPmediated delivery of anti-adenoviral siRNA to the liver for treatment of hAd5 infection in vivo. Initial experiments revealed that two siRNAs, sipTP mod and siPol-1 mod , targeting the adenoviral pTP or Pol gene, which contained 2\u02b9-O-methyl residues, phosphorothioate linkages, and an optimized thermodynamic profile, efficiently inhibited hAd5 infection in vitro. For in vivo use, sipTP mod was encapsulated in LNPs containing the cationic aminolipid XL-10 (LNP-sipTP mod ) and applied concomitantly with hAd5 to immunosuppressed Syrian hamsters. This treatment resulted in distinct inhibition of hAd5 replication in the liver, reduction of hepatic inflammation, normalization of liver transaminase levels, as well as reduction of hAd titers in the blood serum compared with hAd5-infected animals that received a nonsilencing control siRNA (LNP-siContr mod ).",

Lipid miRNA delivery systems may be the most extensively studied non-viral carriers due to their biocompatibility, biodegradability, ease of production, low toxicity and immunogenicity, and the ability to easily modify them for targeted delivery strategies [116]. \n\nThe utilization of liposomes as a carrier for drug delivery in treating diverse diseases, notably cancer, is experiencing rapid growth. miRNA can be encapsulated within liposomes of nanometer size and preserved in a dried state for months, and retain their encapsulation even after prolonged periods of storage [117]. \n\nmiR-122, a liver-specific tumor-suppressor miRNA, is often downregulated in HCC. A cationic lipid nanoparticle formulation, LNP-DP1, was developed to deliver miR-122 to HCC cells, aiming to restore normal gene expression [118]. The miR-122 mimic in LNP-DP1 worked effectively in HCC cells without causing widespread toxicity. When injected directly into tumors, LNP-DP1 with miR-122 mimic suppressed HCC xenograft growth by about 50% within 30 days, correlating with reduced target gene activity and decreased angiogenesis.",

            "text": "In contrast, AA2-DD-3 and AA2-TD-3, with C7 and C9 side chains, showed enhanced delivery to the liver, accompanied by a decrease in delivery to other organs (Figure 5B). Overall, mRNA delivery to the liver of AA2-DD-3 was significantly less efficient (2.4-fold) compared to liver-targeting MC3 LNPs and could be further reduced by 3.5-fold by fine-tuning the side chain composition, as demonstrated with AA2-DL-3 (Figure 5B). This emphasizes the potential to develop APEs as an mRNA delivery platform to nonliver tissues. Liver targeting could potentially be further reduced by excluding cholesterol from APE-LNP formulations due to their low reliance on this excipient for mRNA delivery, as shown in vitro (Figure 4B). This strategy was recently employed by Su et al., to decrease liver accumulation for LNPs containing permanently charged lipids. 52 Based on our findings, we also investigated if the 4C side chain can improve mRNA delivery of the previously reported lung-targeting AA3-DD-3 LNP with a 7C side chain and found that reducing side chain length resulted in a 2.4-fold increase in mRNA delivery to the lungs (Figure S13). This reinforces the importance of optimizing the side chain composition to improve the in vivo performance of APE-LNPs. 25 Optimizing the hydrophobicity of polyesters by Yu et al. led to enhanced performance of mRNA polyplexes in the lungs, suggesting the contribution of polymer hydrophobic domains in interactions with serum or cell components, although the mechanism remains unclear. 53 Notably, the effect of changes in hydrophobicity on the ability of LNPs to target specific organs may differ between biomaterials. Liu et al. reported that multitailed ionizable phospholipids (iPhos) with short alkyl tails predominantly targeted the liver, while long tails preferentially targeted the spleen. 54 o gain further insights into the differences in mRNA delivery to different organs, we studied the biodistribution of APE-LNPs labeled with the fluorescent dye DiR.",

Typically, LNPs consist of cationic/ionizable lipids to encapsulate mRNA molecules through electronic interaction, helper lipids such as cholesterol, phospholipid, and polyethylene glycol (PEG)elipids to maintain particle stability and compatibility. However, certain cationic lipids were reported to induce organ injuries including liver and spleen toxicity 45e47 . In addition, PEG-lipids may induce expression of anti-PEG which might lead to rapid clearance of LNPs 43,45,48e51 . Therefore, efforts have been made to developing lipid materials with high delivery efficiency, organ/cell targeting, and low toxicity. Currently, many mRNA drugs utilizing LNPs as delivery systems are under clinical investigations for the treatment of various solid tumors 20,45,52e54 . \n\nIn 2018, the FDA approved ionizable lipid, (6Z,9Z,28Z,31Z )heptatriaconta-6,9,28,31-tetraen-19-yl 4-(dimethylamino) butanoate (MC3), for siRNA delivery 55 . More recently, MC3-based LNPs were used as delivery systems in mRNA-based cancer immunotherapy. For example, Wang et al. 56 utilized MC3-based LNPs to deliver mRNAs encoding chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5 (CCL5) linked by a single domain antibody (BisCCL2/5i). Intravenous administration of the BisCCL2/5i mRNA-LNP blocked both chemokine ligand signaling pathways and polarized the macrophages towards cancer inhibitory phenotype (M1), thereby achieving a 50% survival rate in pancreatic cancer liver metastasis mouse models. Co-administration of BisCCL2/5i mRNA-LNP with PD-1 ligand inhibitor (PD-Li) resulted in a 57% complete response, establishing a potential therapeutic strategy targeting liver malignancy 56 .",

Similar results have been shown in lowdensity lipoprotein receptor (LDLr) knockout mice, a receptor for apoE that is highly expressed on hepatocytes (Akinc et al. 2010). Furthermore, the PEG-lipid content affects the degree of interaction with serum proteins and cells, as 95% of LNPs containing 0.5 mol% of diffusible PEG-lipids are taken up by the liver 15 min after administration (Chen et al. 2016). Conversely, LNPs with a PEG-lipid content of 5 mol% display increased circulation times and decreased liver uptake (Chen et al. 2016). An emerging alternative to PEGylation is polysarcosine (pSar), a water-soluble polypeptoid, which offers comparable stealth properties to PEG with lower immunogenicity. Moreover, pSar is readily biodegradable and displays a higher transfection potency than conventional PEG-based LNPs (Nogueira et al. 2020).",

            "text": "The FDA approval of ONPATTRO\u00d2, the first RNAi-based drug, has forged the pathway for next generation RNA-based therapeutics reaching the clinic. 3 It was enabled by the development of lipidbased nanoparticles (LNPs) that are used to deliver siRNA to hepatocytes preferentially. 2 This technology has received wide interest and is being deployed to deliver larger nucleic acids, such as messenger RNA and genome-editing components. 35,51 LNP-mediated intracellular delivery of nucleic acids occurs through its interactions with serum proteins, specifically apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which assists their cellular entry to hepatocytes via receptor-mediated endocytosis. 2,31 While LNPs enter hepatocytes in a highly efficient manner, effective cytosolic delivery of nucleic acids remains challenging. In particular, it has been consistently shown that most LNPs are sequestered and degraded in lysosomes 12 or removed to extracellular space, 44 significantly limiting their therapeutic effects. 19,34 In addition, it is difficult to target nonhepatic organs with LNPs due to high liver tropism. It was demonstrated that spleen 21,25 and lung endothelium 28,29 can be targeted by modification of LNP formulations. Nonetheless, the use of LNPs with regards to non-hepatic delivery is still limited, and is the area of focus for next generation therapeutics.\n\nTypically, LNPs consist of four lipids: (1) cationic lipid, (2) PEG lipid, (3) cholesterol, and (4) structural lipid. The first component i.e. the cationic lipid is generally composed of a cationic head group and lipid tails, and is located in the core of LNPs with nucleic acids. This component is extensively explored because of its ability to assemble negatively charged nucleic acids into particles via electrostatic forces, and also in causing cytosolic release of nucleic acid by its interactions with the endosomal membrane. 1,10,16,45 The second component is the PEG lipid which possesses a PEG chain anchored to a lipid headgroup.

Moreover, the elimination of 3 H-PEG-lipid from the liver over 24 hours also appears to depend on chain length, with a large decrease in PEG-C14 levels between 2 and 24 hours compared to PEG-C16 and PEG-C18. These lipids have identical structures including ether linkages between the alkyl chains and headgroup that are resistant to hydrolysis. 17 Therefore, these data suggest that the rate of PEG-lipid elimination from liver tissue may depend on its hydrophobicity and ability to interact with biological membranes. When uptake is expressed in grams lipid/gram of tissue, the spleen removes equivalent amounts of LNPs as liver. However, the spleen is smaller and therefore distribution to this organ typically accounts for <10% of the injected dose. Although standard errors are larger for the spleen data, the trends with respect to PEG-lipid chain length and accumulation are similar to those observed in liver (Figure 5e,f).",

            "text": "We have shown that our biodegradable LNPs were successfully incorporated into liver hepatocytes and led to effective knockdown of target mRNA expression. 15 olipoprotein E (ApoE) and low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) are involved in the incorporation of LNPs into hepatocytes in vivo. 16 Plasma ApoE preferentially binds to PEG lipids of the LNP surface. LDLR proteins on hepatocytes recognize ApoE-LNP complexes, resulting in LNP incorporation via endocytosis. LNPs become cationic due to reduced pH during endosome maturation, leading to LNP fusion to the endosomal membrane. 17 siRNA is finally released into the cytoplasm, thereby inducing RNAi-mediated knockdown of target molecules in hepatocytes. \n\n3][24][25][26] Therefore, gene suppression in mononuclear phagocytes by LNPs may be an effective treatment strategy for such disorders. \n\nIn this study, we comprehensively analyzed the effects of our asymmetric ionizable lipid-based biodegradable LNPs on immune cells. LNPs were strongly incorporated into tissue-resident macrophages, including liver macrophages. Analysis of ApoE-deficient mice revealed that LNP uptake by liver macrophages is not dependent on ApoE expression. Administering LNPs encapsulating siRNA targeting interferon regulatory factor-5 (IRF5) (siIrf5-LNPs), an essential transcription factor in triggering inflammatory responses, reduced IRF5 expression in macrophages in vivo. Furthermore, prophylactic administration of siIrf5-LNPs was effective in preventing liver damage in concanavalin A (Con A)-induced hepatitis. These results indicate that our biodegradable LNPs are a useful tool for analyzing macrophage function in vivo, and they can be used in novel therapies for treating inflammatory diseases.",

            "text": "EVs are membrane-bound vesicles derived from endosomal compartments that are secreted into the extracellular environment following fusion with the plasma membrane They play a crucial role in intercellular communication, transporting various biological molecules such as bioactive lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids, and are involved in the The functionalization of LNPs has emerged as an effective strategy for delivering CRISPR-Cas9 therapeutics. Zhang et al. developed a polyethylene glycol-modified lipid nanocarrier (LPLNP) for delivering Cas9 plasmid/sgRNA to A375 cells. This system efficiently condensed and encapsulated the Cas9/sgPLK-1 plasmid into a core-shell structure (PLNP/DNA), achieving a transfection efficiency of 47.4% in A375 cells. In mouse models, intratumoral injection of the Cas9/sgPLK-1 plasmid into melanoma-bearing mice significantly downregulated polo-like kinase 1 (PLK-1) protein expression, resulting in over 67% inhibition of tumor growth [79]. \n\nA critical advantage of LNPs is their ability to target tissues with high precision. This capability is primarily achieved by modulating lipid composition, significantly reducing the off-target effects associated with non-specific delivery methods. LNPs demonstrate particularly high accumulation efficiency in the liver, making them suitable for treating liver diseases. The efficiency, scalability, and potential for single-administration treatments position LNP-based delivery systems as promoting candidates for clinical applications [80]. Intellia Therapeutics initiated the first clinical trial using LNPs as a delivery vector for CRISPR-Cas9, targeting hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis with polyneuropathy (ATTRv-PN) in NTLA-2001 therapy. This therapy aims to edit the TTR gene in hepatocytes. Interim clinical results published in 2021 showed that a high dose (0.3 mg/kg) of NTLA-2001 led to an average 87% reduction in serum TTR protein levels by day 28 post-treatment, while a low dose (0.1 mg/kg) achieved a 52% reduction. Mild adverse effects were observed, but they resolved quickly.",

            "text": "LNPs are the most researched liver-specific targeting nanosystems loaded with mRNA. The main liver-specific targeting mechanisms are passive and endogenous targeting, owing to the structure and function of the liver. Research indicates that LNPs with a pKa value of six -seven are best-suited for mRNA delivery to the liver [114]. Among them, ionizable cationic lipids containing amino groups, such as DLin-MC3-DMA (MC3) [46], 5A2-SC8 [103], 306O i10 [104], and cationic lipid-modified aminoglycosides (CLAs) [105] exhibit high liver-targeting efficacy. The distribution of the LNPs with amino groups in liver can be as high as 81%, with the mRNA expression over 90% [104]. Nevertheless, the targeted precision delivery of mRNA should be carefully evaluated at the cellular level, as the degree of mRNA expression varies among different liver cell types in the above-mentioned research. \n\nHepatocytes account for about 80% of liver tissue and are implicated in many hereditary diseases, making them the primary targets for mRNA delivery. To enter the Disse space and directly contact hepatocytes, mRNA-LNPs for hepatocyte-targeted delivery are generally smaller than the fenestration of hepatic vascular endothelium, which measures approximately 150 nm. Hashiba et al. [115] synthesized a series of mRNA-LNPs with varying particle sizes and demonstrated that LNPs with sizes ranging from 60 to 100 nm can pass through the sinusoidal endothelial fenestrae of the liver, enhancing the hepatocyte targeting efficiency of mRNAs. Siegwart et al. [106,116,117] proposed a selector organ targeting (SORT) strategy (Fig. 7A). They synthesized 5A2-SC8-mRNA-LNPs with a particle size of approximately 122 nm. Incorporation of 20% ionizable cationic lipid 1,2-dioleoyl-3-dimethylammonium-propane (DODAP) into LNPs improved the uptake efficiency of hepatocytes to as high as 93% [106].",

            "text": "Short interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) therapeutics show promise for the treatment of intestinal diseases by specifically suppressing the expression of disease relevant proteins. Recently, a class of lipid-like materials termed \u201clipidoids\u201d have been shown to potently deliver siRNA to the liver and immune cells. Here, we seek to establish the utility of lipidoid nanoparticles (LNPs) in the context of siRNA delivery to the intestinal epithelium. Initial studies demonstrated that the siRNA-loaded LNPs mediated potent, dose dependent, and durable gene silencing in Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells, with a single 10 nM dose depressing GAPDH mRNA expression for one week. Transfection with siRNA-loaded LNPs did not induce significant cytotoxicity in Caco-2 cells or alter intestinal barrier function. Protein silencing was confirmed by Western blotting, with the lowest levels of GAPDH protein expression observed five days post-transfection. Together, these data underscore the potential of LNPs for the treatment of intestinal disorders.",

Histological analysis demonstrated a notable increase in intracellular lipid accumulation in the liver of the model group compared to the control group as illustrated in Figure 11A,B. This was accompanied by elevated hepatic TC and TG levels (TC: model 0.04 \u00b1 0.01, control 0.01 \u00b1 0.008; TG: model 0.11 \u00b1 0.06, control 0.07 \u00b1 0.01 mmol/g liver) along with a rise in the positive area ratio of optical density by 13.139% and 2.426%, respectively. Liver sections from the low-dose group exhibited fewer lipid droplets, as depicted in Figure 11C. However, there was no significant difference from the model group, as both groups displayed high levels of liver TG and TC (TG: L-NSPs 0.1 \u00b1 0.03, model 0.11 \u00b1 0.06; TC: L-NSPs 0.03 \u00b1 0.01, model 0.04 \u00b1 0.01 mmol/g liver). In contrast, liver sections from the medium-dose and high-dose groups revealed a significant reduction in lipid droplet deposition compared to the model group (Figure 11D,E), characterized by a notable decrease in liver TC and TG accumulation (TC: M-NSPs 0.008 \u00b1 0.006, H-NSPs 0.01 \u00b1 0.003; TG: M-NSPs 0.04 \u00b1 0.02, H-NSPs 0.04 \u00b1 0.004 mmol/g liver).

Post-intravenous administration, LNPs are naturally directed to the liver due to the adsorption of plasma proteins like apolipoprotein E. In the present work, we have re-engineered LNPs with ionic liquids (ILs) to reduce plasma protein adsorption and potentially increase the accumulation of LNPs in hard-to-deliver central nervous system (CNS) targets such as brain endothelial cells (BECs) and neurons. We have developed two approaches to re-engineer LNPs using a choline trans-2-hexenoate IL: first, we have optimized an IL-coating process using the standard LNP formulation and in the second approach, we have incorporated ILs into the LNPs by replacing the PEG-lipid component in the standard formulation using ILs. IL-coated as well as IL-incorporated LNPs were colloidally stable with morphologies similar to the standard LNPs. IL-coated LNPs showed superior uptake into mouse BECs and neurons and demonstrated reduced mouse plasma protein adsorption compared to the standard LNPs. Overall, our results (1) demonstrate the feasibility of re-engineering the clinically approved LNP platform with highly tunable biomaterials like ILs for the delivery of therapeutics to CNS targets like BECs and neurons and (2) suggest that the surface properties of LNPs play a critical role in altering their affinity to and uptake into hard-to-deliver cell types.",

            "text": "The usage of the fast-shedding PEG-lipid allowed more hepatocyte targeting compared with Kupffer cells, the liver macrophages, thus improving the effectivity of LNP-siRNA drug [60]. This study is in agreement with the previous study by Judge et al. where the authors found less formed anti-PEG antibodies and a substantial reduction of side effects upon repetitive dosing in mice when PEGylated liposomes containing a shorter alkyl chain (C14) PEG-lipid versus a longer alkyl chain C16 PEG-lipid were used [151]. Studies directly examining the effects of anti-PEG antibodies on the efficacy and safety of LNP-mRNA drugs containing PEG lipids are still very limited. Recently, Nogueira et al. examined diverse chain lengths and molar fractions of stealth lipid Polysarcosine (PSar) and found efficient mRNA delivery with a lower cytokine pro-inflammatory profile, reduced complement activation, and liver toxicity markers, compared with PEG-containing LNPs [59]. \n\nLocalization to particular tissues and the active targeting of LNP-mRNA therapeutics to specific cell types and organs are a topic of particular interest that can improve current off-target effects and pave a route for novel applications in difficult-to-target tissues. As already discussed, localization to particular tissues can be achieved by optimization on the mRNA level by introducing cell type specific miRNA target sites to 3 UTRs leading to the degradation of the mRNA, leading to the loss of translation efficacy of LNP-mRNA in selected cell types [128]. However, optimization on the level of LNP is the main focus with diverse approaches based on changing LNP structural components and optimizing LNP composition or those actively targeting specific cells using a functionalized surface, for example, with targeting ligands or antibodies. Most of the currently developed LNPs largely localize to the liver through apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-mediated uptake [152]. ApoE binds to LNP in circulation and facilitates binding to low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) on hepatocytes, allowing the endocytosis of LNP-mRNA to the cell.",

            "text": "This structural change allowed the GMC drug to penetrate into the LNPs' core, leading to effective encapsulation of the GMC. Furthermore, during the synthesis of LNPs, we added DSPE-mPEG2000, which effectively prevents LNPs from binding to plasma proteins and being prematurely cleared by the mononuclearphagocyte system, thereby extending the circulation time of LNPs [40]. LNPs can enter the liver through the pores of the liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. A portion of the LNPs may be phagocytosed by the hepatic reticuloendothelial system (RES) and delivered to lysosomes, where the drug is released after lysosomal dissolution. Another portion may bind to the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and other lipid-associated receptors on the surface of liver cells and enter the cells via endocytosis to exert its therapeutic effect [21]. \n\nOur results demonstrate that LNP-GMC exhibited minimal cytotoxicity in vitro and did not induce significant hemolysis in vivo, suggesting that LNPs are a biologically safe medium for hepatic drug delivery. This finding aligns with previous studies supporting lipid-based carriers for hepatic applications, citing their biocompatibility and minimal adverse effects [41]. However, some studies have noted that interactions between nanoparticles and immune cells may induce subtle immune responses, even when biocompatibility is high [42]. Although we observed no significant immune responses in our experimental model, future research could further assess potential immune interactions under a range of clinical conditions to ensure that LNP-GMC is suitable for broad application in ALI patients. \n\nLNPs of different sizes have different biological distribution and physical properties in vivo [43]. In the LNP synthesis process, we can control the particle size by optimizing factors such as lipid composition, ethanol-to-aqueous phase ratio, injection rate, and stirring speed [40]. In our study, to ensure both uniformity and a consistent diameter of approximately 200 nm, the synthesized mixture was subjected to physical extrusion through a 200 nm polycarbonate film.",

            "text": "The lion's share of various LNPs gets distributed to the liver and to a lesser extent to the spleen, and the reason is the presence of a sinusoidal discontinuous endothelium with pores of a ~100-200 nm diameter in these organs (Kumar et al., 2023). After intravenous administration and entry into the bloodstream, a protein corona forms on the surface of LNPs, and this topic is investigated in detail in Dilliard et al. (2021). The protein corona is capable of influencing the biodistribution of nanoparticles among tissues in various organs owing to the adsorption of the proteins on the tissue surface, leading to internalization via specific receptors. The best-studied mechanism of targeting of LNPs involves their uptake by hepatocytes via binding to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors on their surface (Paunovska et al., 2022). The ApoE protein present in blood plasma is a ligand of LDL receptors and binds to cholesterol on the nanoparticles' surface and ensures their predominant accumulation in liver cells (Paunovska et al., 2022;Da Silva Sanchez et al., 2022). This mechanism is confirmed by experimental data where LNPs incubated with ApoE have been found to be targeted to hepatocytes (Johnson et al., 2022); on the other hand, particles with a protein corona composed of albumin are distributed preferentially into Kupffer cells instead of hepatocytes (Johnson et al., 2022). Overall, the delivery of LNPs into cells by an ApoE-independent mechanism leads to their accumulation in cells other than hepatocytes (Wadhera et al., 2016). A decrease in the proportion of cholesterol also impairs the delivery of LNPs to hepatocytes (Kawaguchi et al., 2023). Because of the fairly widespread expression of LDL receptor in human tissues (https:// www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000130164-LDLR/tissue),",

            "text": "LNPs principally contain an ionizable lipid that not only drives RNA encapsulation through their pH driven ability to form ion-pair interactions with the anionic phosphate backbone of RNA, but also aids in triggering endosomal escape through membrane destabilization (Kulkarni et al., 2018;Semple et al., 2001;Semple et al., 2010;Viger-Gravel et al., 2018;Lechanteur et al., 2018;Zelphati and Szoka, 1996;Sabnis et al., 2018). Other typical constituents of LNPs are a phospholipid and cholesterol to maintain structural integrity, and an outer polyethylene glycol (PEG) lipid to coat the LNP (Kulkarni et al., 2018;Semple et al., 2001;Leung et al., 2012;Crawford et al., 2011). This outer decoration protects LNPs from the host immune response, imparts serum stability and is cleavable once inside the target cell (Fig. 1 A). Typically, the ionizable lipids used in LNP formulations are neutral at physiological pH, and hence they possess the characteristics of a neutral liposome. Neutral liposomes of < 100 nm hydrodynamic size have an overwhelming bias towards hepatocytes. Previously, Yan et al. have demonstrated the plasma apolipoprotein E (ApoE) dependent enhanced plasma clearance of neutral liposomes by measuring a 3.6-fold faster rate of clearance vis-\u00e0-vis negatively charged liposomes in wild type mice versus ApoE deficient mice (Yan et al., 2005). This was further supported by Akinc et al. (Akinc et al., 2010) by showing the enhanced liver uptake of ionizable LNP (iLNP) compared to cationic LNP (cLNP) in the presence of ApoE. This necessitates alternative strategies for extrahepatic delivery of LNPs. In this regard, lung and lung airway is an organ of great therapeutic relevance that can be targeted by LNPs.",

            "text": "Importantly, these novel lipids did not induce an increase in liver enzymes (SGPT, SGOT) or activate the immune system. Recently, Liu shuai's group synthesized a series of novel multi-tailed ionizable phospholipids (iPhos) to form multi-component lipid nanoparticles (iPLNPs) for organ-selective nuclei acid delivery [59]. Compared with DOPE and DSPC, iPhos exhibited the characteristics of strong endosomal escape properties, due to the chemical structures of phospholipids. DOPE and DSPC consist of one irreversible zwitterion head and two hydrophobic tails, while iPhos possesses a PH-switchable small zwitterion head and three hydrophobic alkyl tails. A small zwitterion head combined with three hydrophobic tails would more easily form a cone than one with two tails, causing easier membrane phase transition and endosomal escape. Importantly, the length of the iPhos chain determines organ selectivity in vivo. For example, the formulas 9A1P9-5A2-SC8 and 9A1P9-DDAB can preferentially deliver the target nucleic acid to the liver and lung, respectively. Alternatively, extrahepatic targeting can also be achieved by modifying the surface of LNPs with ligands or antibodies [79]. \n\nPharmaceutics 2022, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 10 of 29 with elevated levels of ALT and bile acid, but LNP/DLin-MC3-DMA has not [84].Although the composition change, modification or functionalization of LNPs can facilitate the uptake, release of siRNA and the delivery of siRNA to other organ sites, it increases its complexity and toxicity. Indeed, there have been clinical trials of LNP formulation delivering siRNA for cancer treatment (e.g., TKM-080301, DCR-MYC, NBF-006), but some serious adverse events have been observed in subjects [25]. Therefore, researchers must consider optimizing the composition and proportion of LNP components to reduce toxicity without affecting siRNA efficiency, which will be a main research direction in the future.",

            "text": "Although lipid nanovehicles were initially used for RNA delivery in the late 1970s, three LNP-based RNA therapeutics have been approved for marketing in the past five years, suggesting a profound bottleneck in the clinical use of lipid nanovehicles. First, the potency and toxicities of lipid formulations are the most crucial indicators. Fortunately, some high-throughput methods have been developed for lipid synthesis and formulation optimization, facilitating rapid screening of high-potency and low-toxicity lipid formulations. Li et al. 174 designed a three-component reaction system to simplify the tedious lipid synthesis process and rapidly synthesized a library of 720 novel biodegradable ionizable lipids. Kauffman et al. 175 utilized the Design of Experiment (DOE) for LNP formulation optimization and thus considerably reduced the number of individual experiments required to establish statistically significant trends. The resulting LNPs loaded with erythropoietin mRNA showed 7-fold higher potency than the original LNP formulation. Surface PEGylation increases lipid nanovehicle stability in vitro and prolongs lipid nanovehicle retention in blood by preventing the adsorption of plasma proteins and reducing subsequent MPS uptake. However, it also prevents lipid nanovehicles from entering cells and escaping from endosomes (i.e., the PEG dilemma) 79 and leads to rapid elimination of lipid nanovehicles by stimulating B cells to secrete anti-PEG IgM (i.e., the ABC phenomenon) 104e106 . In contrast, biomembrane camouflage reduces MPS uptake of lipid nanovehicles, promotes their cell internalization, and shows little immunogenicity, representing a more appealing strategy 131 . However, no biomimetic lipid nanovehicle-based RNA drugs have yet been approved for use in the clinical, mainly because of their batch-to-batch variation and lack of scalable production methods 176 . A practical solution to these challenges will inspire the development of biomimetic lipid nanovehicle-based RNA therapeutics. \n\nDue to the liver tropism of lipid nanovehicles, targeting tissues outside the liver is still challenging.",

            "text": "LNP typically consists of four components, including ionizable lipids, cholesterol, helper phospholipid, and polyethylene glycol (PEG)-lipids [86].\n\nThese four components can form stable nanoparticles to encapsulate and protect vulnerable mRNA. Upon entering the cells through endocytosis, they become positively charged in the acidic environment of endosomes, facilitating the subsequent release of the RNAs into the cytoplasm. However, LNP-formulated mRNAs tend to accumulate in the liver, possibly due to the binding of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) onto the LNP surface followed by the ApoE receptor-mediated uptake to hepatocytes [50]. Most of the LNP-mRNA drugs are concentrated in the liver and spleen after tail vein administration, while a small amount is preserved in adipose tissues [87]. When administered intramuscularly, the expression of mRNA drugs is mainly found in the liver, muscle, and lymph nodes [88,89].\n\nIn addition, non-liver delivery of LNP may be achieved by modifying lipid compositions, which includes changing the lipid identities and/or adjusting lipid ratios. The LNP composition can substantially affect the intracellular delivery efficiency, determine cell specificity of delivery, and modulate immunogenicity.\n\nFor instance, the addition of SORT lipids to LNP changed the organ-targeting properties of LNP in vivo and achieved mRNA delivery to a lot of organs other than the liver [90]. Moreover, SORT is compatible with various gene-editing technologies, such as Cas9 mRNA/sgRNA and Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex. Changes in LNP surface chemistry through modulating PEG-lipid structure were found to assist LNP targeting of bone marrow endothelial cells in the hematopoietic stem cell niche [91], which may also be used in mRNA delivery. Interestingly, LNP technologies can achieve targeted delivery by adjusting the stoichiometry of LNP components, which was exemplified by the success in lymph node-targeting delivery of mRNA in mice [92].\n\nOther strategies, like additional non-lipid components in LNP formulation, also contribute to the",

The interactions of LNPs with other liver cell subtypes, such as CD74-expressing macrophages and CD32-expressing endothelial cells, affect how efficiently nucleic acids are delivered. 32 Table 1 summarizes these cell types and their interactions with LNPs. \n\nKupffer cells are distinct macrophages that reside in the liver sinusoids, are responsible for a large fraction of the body's total macrophages, and are involved in clearing circulating nanoparticles and other foreign materials from the blood. Kupffer cells rapidly take up LNPs, resulting in their predominant distribution in the liver after intravenous administration. 23,33 Alongside their phagocytic function, Kupffer cells have defined subpopulations with inflammatory (CD74High) and tolerogenic (CD74Low) phenotypes, 32 which can influence the immune response and nanoparticle clearance. Their high uptake often limits the amount of LNPs reaching hepatocytes, as Kupffer cells sequester the nanoparticles before they can reach their target cells, reducing functional delivery. 35  et al. 11 demonstrated that modulating Kupffer cell activity can enhance nanoparticle delivery to target tissues.

            "text": "In recent years, RNA therapeutics have received tremendous attention as a tool to regulate gene expression in patients. These approaches include the regulation of abnormal gene expression by short interfering RNA (siRNA) and mRNA (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)(7)(8). There have been two U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved siRNA therapeutics (patisiran and givosiran) for rare disease treatments. These drugs target the selective degradation of mRNA to reduce the expression of diseaseassociated proteins in polyneuropathy and acute hepatic porphyria (2,5,9). In addition, synthetic mRNA can produce insufficient proteins (e.g., factor IX and vascular endothelial growth factor) in patients to treat various diseases such as hemophilia A and ischemic heart disease (3,6). Furthermore, in vivo genome editing has been introduced, and multiple studies reported a successful gene editing in mice by the delivery of a single guide RNA with synthetic mRNA encoding CRISPR-Cas9 (10,11). \n\nTo fully realize the potential of RNA therapeutics, an efficient in vivo delivery system is of the utmost importance. Ionizable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been widely used for the systemic delivery of RNA therapeutics. LNPs are mainly composed of ionizable lipid or lipid-like materials with helper lipid, cholesterol, and polyethylene glycol (PEG)-lipid. Previously, various types of ionizable lipid materials were reported for LNP formulations such as C12-200, cKK-E12, and DLin-MC3-DMA (12)(13)(14). These LNPs showed an efficient gene silencing in the liver at the dosing level of 0.002 mg of siRNA/kg (14). The mechanism of cellular uptake was well investigated, and adsorption of serum ApoE (apolipoprotein E) on the surface of LNPs was a major effector facilitating the intracellular delivery of LNPs into hepatocytes through low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors (15).",

            "text": ", the expected longer circulation time of LNPs coated with C18 compared to C14 PEG-lipids do not change final transfection efficacy and/or apoE adsorption levels. These data lead one to question whether PEG-lipid desorption (when using 1.5 mol% PEGlipid) is essential for apoE adsorption to LNPs.\n\nIn addition to the indirect active targeting properties obtained via the association between apoE and LNPs in blood, more passive targeting could be attained by preserving the steric barrier of the LNP in vivo. A PEG-lipid like the PEG-DSPE (C18) (Fig. 3B) used in Doxil \u00d2 inhibits rapid desorption and thus limits protein binding and clearance by the mononuclear phagocytic system, thereby prolonging circulation time of the PEGylated nanocarrier. Approaches [72-74] using a persistent PEG-lipid to improve LNP accumulation elsewhere employ a formulation with compromised activity and therefore require higher doses to achieve silencing at the target tissue. A slow PEG desorption rate will also minimize specific uptake in the liver and further increase circulation time, enhancing LNP accumulation in tumor tissues [51].\n\nTaken together, the research detailed above shows that the choice of PEG-lipid greatly influences key LNP properties such as size, stability, in vivo distribution, and transfection efficiency. PEG-lipids stabilize LNPs during preparation and storage by providing a steric barrier that both drives self-assembly and prevents aggregation. Further, the type of PEG-lipid partly controls LNP circulation time and cellular interactions. Which PEG-lipid to choose highly depends on therapeutic purpose, target organ and/or cell type, and administration route, and should include considerations regarding both molar ratios and length of the akyl/acyl chain(s) constituting the lipid tail, as these parameters have all shown to influence key properties of LNPs.\n\n3.2.1.2. Do PEG-lipids stimulate an immune response?. Grafting PEG to long chained lipids onto liposomes grants them stealth-like properties that prolong their half-life in circulation.

            "text": "And changing formulation to lyophilized form or adding cryoprotectant, such as mannitol and sucrose, are feasible methods to improve the stability of LNP formulations [61]. \n\nDespite some studies show that lipid materials may cause liver or lung injuries and the cytotoxicity of LNPs is related to the dosage of administration and the properties of lipids used, LNPs offer several advantages compared to viral vectors, including ease of production, relatively low immunogenicity, high RNA loading capacity, and flexible design options [61,62]. Most LNPs are prone to target liver and usually be utilized to treat liver diseases. For instance, Onpattro with DLin-MC3-DMA LNP as the vector, is administrated intravenously and enables the inhibition of hepatic production of transthyretin [63]. Yang et al. demonstrated that LNPs encapsulating HNF4A mRNA could attenuate liver fibrosis in preclinical mouse model [64]. Finn et al. used a degradable lipid to formulate LNPs to deliver Cas9 mRNA/sgRNA for gene editing in vivo. The results showed that the editing efficiency was highly considerable for transthyretin gene editing in the liver, reducing serum protein levels by over 97% with a single dose [65]. Recently, some studies have revealed the rules of LNP targeting different liver cell subsets. It is reported that altering surface charge on the LNP in Onpattro formulation from neutral to anionic, the vector was prone to deliver mRNA to the hepatic reticuloendothelial system [66]. Additionally, researchers discovered that altering the size, adjusting PEG-lipid content, or incorporating ligands in LNPs affected the distribution of loaded cargoes in hepatocytes and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), or increased the delivery efficiency in extrahepatic organ. For instance, LNPs with 100 nm diameter in size are the most effective for targeting LSECs, while LNPs with smaller diameters, such as 60 nm, showed tropism for hepatocytes [67].",

            "text": "Kim investigated the possibility of replacing DSCP in LNPs with naturally occurring glycerol derivatives, such as 2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-O-4 \u2032 -(N,N,N-trimethyl)homoserine (DGTS). DTGS is a betaine lipid, derived from plants, characterized by short lipid tails (palmitic acid) in which the zwitterionic headgroup is connected to the glycerol moiety by a branch of hydrocarbons. This type of configuration may alter the LNP formulation in terms of membrane rigidity, a parameter that influences the intracellular delivery efficiency of nucleic acid. In particular, the introduction of DGTS in place of DSPC improves delivery to the liver via intravenous injection but reduces the efficacy of nebulized LNPs for the intranasal delivery of mRNA [110]. \n\nThe DOPE is composed of a relatively small primary amino headgroup, phosphoethanolamine, and two bulky unsaturated oleoyl tails, responsible for its low melting temperature (about 30 \u2022 C), forming a shape like a cone. This lipid geometry forms a more fluid lipid layer and can stabilize the non-bilayer hexagonal II (HII) phase, promoting lipid membrane fusion to the endosomal membrane and/or bilayer disruption [80,105]. For these properties in the LNPs, the presence of DOPE in LNP formulations improves the RNA transfection efficiency compared with DSPC-containing LNPs [30]. Zhang and colleagues investigated the different body distribution of nanoparticles with the same formulation differing only in the presence of DSPC or DOPE, as helper phospholipids. The study reported that LNPs containing the unsaturated phospholipid distribute preferentially in the liver, while those containing DSPC accumulate in the spleen probably for a different interaction with apolipoprotein E (ApoE), stronger for DOPE-LNPs than that with DSPC; suggesting an influence of the structural lipid on LNP biodistribution [80].",

            "text": "LNP-based mRNA therapy is a promising nucleic acid therapy that can target many diseases that are hardly targeted by small molecules. The success of the mRNA vaccine in the COVID-19 pandemic boosts the development of mRNA-loaded LNP for the treatment of many different diseases, including infections, cancer, and genetic disease. The physical properties of LNP, including particle size, morphology, and surface properties, are greatly influenced by lipid structure and composition, and these physical properties will affect the efficacy, safety, and drug distribution of LNP. In this review, we introduce the site-specific LNP for mRNA delivery from three aspects, including LNP that was locally injected, organ-targeted LNP after intravenous injection, and cell-targeted LNP after intravenous injection. \n\nLocal administration of LNP allows the direct interactions between LNP and target tissues or organs. Many routes of administration have been proven to be effective for mRNA delivery by LNP, including oral administration for the treatment of IBD, inhalation for the treatment of H1N1 infection, etc. The advantage of local administration is the high delivery efficiency and low systemic toxicity. However, local injection is difficult to achieve for some diseases such as brain disorders and metastatic tumors. \n\nIn addition to local administration, intravenous injection is widely used for LNP drugs. The first FDA-approved LNP drug Onpattro mainly accumulate in the liver after intravenous injection, which was mediated by the interaction of adsorped ApoE on LNP and LDLR on hepatocytes. To achieve specific delivery of LNP to other organs or cells, a large number of strategies were used, including (1) changing the structure of functionalized lipids, including ionizable lipids, cholesterol, and PEGylated lipids; (2) changing the ratio of different lipids in LNP; (3) surface modification after the preparation of LNP. All of these change the distribution of LNPs after intravenous injection by increasing the nonspecific or specific interactions with different target organs or cells. There are still some challenges and problems that remain unsolved. 89 For the first strategy, the structure change of different lipids may introduce unexpected toxicities.",

            "text": "The objective of this study was to develop two lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulations capable of efficiently expressing a reporter mRNA while co-delivering the anti-inflammatory drug dexamethasone (DX) to reduce inflammatory side effects in protein replacement therapies. Two types of LNPs were developed, in which 25% of cholesterol was replaced by DX. These LNPs contained either 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC) or 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) as a helper lipid. The resulting LNPs exhibited high stability, homogeneity, and near-neutral Zeta potentials. SAXS experiments confirmed DX incorporation into the LNP core, with slow in vitro DX release observed over 48 h. The LNPs achieved high mRNA encapsulation efficiency (95\u2013100%) and effectively transfected HepG2 cells, dendritic cells, and hPBMCs. While LNPs increased cytokine release (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, MCP-1), LNPs-DX significantly reduced cytokine levels, demonstrating enhanced anti-inflammatory properties while maintaining mRNA expression levels. In vivo biodistribution showed predominant liver localization post-intramuscular injection, regardless of the DSPC or DOPE composition. LNPs co-loaded with mRNA and DX are promising candidates for continuous protein replacement. Due to their ability to reduce treatment-related inflammation while maintaining significant mRNA expression levels, these LNPs are perfectly suited for the treatment of liver-related metabolic diseases.",

            "text": "The particle size of nanoparticles may be attributed to the composition (lipid, surfactant and dispersion medium) and homogenization parameters. Increasing the proportion of the surfactant, raising the homogenizing pressure and temperature, and prolonging the homogenizing time can reduce the particle size. Lipid viscosity is also an important parameter that affects the particle size. Nanoparticles with a hydrodynamic diameter of less than 5 nm are usually rapidly cleared by renal filtration after intravenous administration [115]. Nanoparticles between 15 and 200 nm in size often accumulate in the liver and spleen after being trapped by Kupper cells and macrophages, while particles larger than 200 nm accumulate in the spleen [116,117]. Meanwhile, PEGylated lipids control the size of LNPs by providing a hydrophilic shell that limits vesicle fusion during assembly; studies have shown that appropriate increases in the concentration of PEGylated lipids produce smaller LNPs [118]. When the molar fraction of PEGylated lipids was changed from 0.25% to 5%, the LNP size was reduced from 117 nm to 25 nm. Basha et al. [119] tested the efficiency of gene transfection in mouse hepatocytes and hepatic macrophages using LNPs with a particle size of 80-360 nm and concluded that the delivery within the liver was more favorable with smaller particles, while the opposite was true for macrophages. However, this conclusion was refuted in a subsequent study in which LNPs that were 27-117 nm in size were prepared by varying the amount of PEG lipids (0.25-5%) and assessed for hepatic gene-silencing activity after intravenous injection into mice [120]. All of the LNPs showed a similar accumulation in the liver; the optimal LNP size for silencing hepatocytes was 78 nm. Both the smallest (27 nm) and largest particles (117 nm) showed a poor efficacy, which may have been due to the stability of the LNPs (rapid breakdown of the lipid component) or their inability to penetrate the dense blood vessels of the mouse liver.",

For liver-specific targeting, the addition of an ionizable cationic lipid, e.g., DODAP, has been shown to enhance liver accumulation. The SORT LNP mechanism uses serum protein adsorption, where proteins (e.g., ApoE) can bind to the nanoparticle surface and mediate uptake by target cells, such as hepatocytes via LDL receptors or through other tissue-specific pathways, depending on the recruited proteins. \n\nThe mechanism of tissue-specific targeting of SORT LNPs is illustrated in Figure 4. This proposed three-step consists of (1) desorption of PEG lipids from the nanoparticle surface, (2) binding of specific plasma proteins to the exposed SORT molecules, and (3) receptormediated uptake in target tissues. The figure shows how modifying the PEG-lipid properties (e.g., using less-sheddable PEG lipids like C18-PEG2K) significantly reduces targeting efficiency, as demonstrated by decreased bioluminescence in target organs. Additionally, the plasma protein binding profiles shown in the figure emphasize how the molecular structure of SORT molecules influences the protein corona composition and isoelectric point distribution, directly affecting organ-specific biodistribution. 65 SORT nanoparticles also can be designed to selectively edit therapeutically relevant cell types such as epithelial cells, endothelial cells, B cells, T cells, and hepatocytes, using various gene-editing modalities, e.g., mRNA, Cas9 mRNA/single guide RNA, and Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complexes. 66",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a versatile and efficient delivery platform for delivering various cargo, including RNA vaccines and therapeutics. [1,2] They are primarily composed of ionizable lipids, helper lipids, cholesterols, and polyethylene glycol (PEG)-ylated lipids, all of which contribute to their encapsulation efficiency, structural integrity, stability, and circulation times. [2] LNPs have gained significant attention following their successful use in mRNA vaccines approved by the Food and Drug Administration and used during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) pandemic. [3] Recently, substantial efforts have been made in the development of mRNA vaccines for the treatment and prevention of various diseases. [4,5] These mRNA vaccines have shown promising results and are currently undergoing clinical trials; [2,3,5] the majority of them employ the LNP platform as their delivery system. [3] onizable lipids have been developed to maximize mRNA delivery efficiency in terms of encapsulation, cellular uptake, and endosomal release with minimal toxicity. Ionizable lipids maintain a neutral LNP surface at physiological pH, reducing the toxicity compared to cationic materials, [2] and become positively charged in the acidic environment in endosome, facilitating the release of mRNA. [6,7] Focusing on the development of biocompatible ionizable lipids, efforts have been made to use vitamins as a part of lipids to leverage their low toxicity and intrinsic functions. The most commonly utilized vitamins are the fatsoluble vitamins A, E, and D. They are not only suitable for use as tails but also act as targeting moiety for the liver (in the case of vitamin A) or as adjuvants to activate an immune response itself after decomposition in the body (in the case of vitamin E). [8][9][10] Additionally, the water-soluble vitamins B3, C, and H have also been reported to be mostly utilized by conjugating them to the ends of ionizable lipids.",

            "text": "Whether the ionizable lipids play a direct role in endosomal uptake has not been thoroughly investigated. Studies on LNP-siRNA accumulation in the liver show that the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) on hepatocytes mediates the LNP uptake; in apoE-deficient or LDLR-deficient mice, LNP-siRNA do not display the same gene silencing potency [34]. ApoE is an exchangeable apolipoprotein and a ligand for LDLR-mediated uptake of remnant chylomicrons [35]. Consequently, the apoE adsorption on LNPs turn them into biomimicking remanent chylomicrons that are taken up by hepatocytes. This mechanism clearly demonstrates how, rather than being an obstacle, protein (apoE) corona formation on nanomedicines introduced into blood can be exploited for targeting strategies. ApoE adsorption to liposomes does not drive hepatocyte uptake of negatively charged liposomes [36], and hepatocyte uptake of neutral liposomes is >20-fold lower in apoE-deficient mice. Surface charge, including the composition of the protein adsorbed to lipid-based particles, thus plays a role in the clearance mechanism. When using ionizable lipids/LNPs with an apparent pK a of $6.4, about 10% of the ionizable lipids are positively charged in blood (pH 7.4) according to the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The surface charge may not only affect the protein corona composition on nanoparticles but also influence the conformation of the adsorbed proteins, including apoE. Taken together, these inquiries show the interplay between nanomedicines, including LNPs and biomolecules such as apoE in biological fluids, is affected by surface composition, surface charge, and particle size [37]. Such interplay determines the in vivo fate of many nanomedicines. More detailed discussions and recent literature about how size and surface charge affect LNP biodistribution will be presented in Section 5.\n\nThe internalization mechanism of the mRNA-LNP COVID-19 vaccines following intramuscular (",

[195] reported a novel modifiable LNP platform called selective organ targeting (SORT) LNP, which adds a fifth lipid component to the established LNP formulation.SORT LNPs delivered different CRISPR cargoes, including mRNA, Cas9 mRNA-sgRNA, and Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes, for efficient genome editing in the liver, lungs, and spleen after i.v.administration.Although this strategy is very promising in expanding the usefulness of LNPs, the possible reason why SORT LNPs preferentially accumulate in the liver is that they are easily opsonized and captured by the hepatocytes, partially due to ApoE binding to the LNPs in the blood steam [196].In addition, selective delivery to the lungs may result from the positive surface charge of intravascular SORT LNPs [195].Therefore, to achieve more success in other tissues, such as the brain, stealth SORT LNPs will be needed [195].This could potentially be a promising start for the application of precision LNPs to target the brain.",

            "text": "However, EL inhibitors such as GSK264220A might induce systemic side effects due to their interference with the physiological roles of EL in lipid metabolism. 44 Therefore, it would be more efficient to develop an LNP formulation for which the pKa value of the membrane would be optimal for targeting LSECs using lipase-resistant lipids. \n\nThere are two possible strategies for optimizing the pKa of an LNP membrane for LSECs targeting. The first strategy is the synthesis of various lipids with different chemical structures and pKa values for use in preparing LNPs with a wide range of membrane pKa values and screen the uptake and activity of each in LSECs. However, this method is time-and effort-consuming, not cost-effective, and results in limited pKa adjustments. Therefore, we adopted a more effective strategy, which involved mixing two lipids at different molar ratios with low and high pKa values in several LNP formulations to permit the pKa value of the final LNP membrane. These lipids are YSK05 (a pH-sensitive cationic lipid with a pKa value of 6.50), and YSK12-C4 (a highly cationic lipid with a pKa value of 8.00). Their chemical structures are shown in Figure 1. These lipids were chosen because they have a strong endosomal escape, strong activity (YSK05 in hepatocytes, in vivo, 33 and YSK12-C4 in dendritic cells, in vitro 36 ), and are resistant to the action of lipases.

They have recently been in the spotlight for their role as RNA nanocarriers in clinical applications, 1 and recent examples include the BioNTech/Pfizer's BNT162b2 and Moderna's mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. They have also been investigated as extracellular vesicle (EV) mimetics, which have been shown to play important roles in tissue repair via paracrine signaling 2 after myocardial infarction (MI). EVs have been shown to induce angiogenesis, 3 reduce fibrosis, 4 and improve overall the contractile capacity of the heart in ischemic animal models due to their RNA and protein cargoes. 5 owever, clinical translation of EVs is challenging and is hampered by a lack of scalability, heterogenicity in both particle size (ranging from 30 nm up to 2 \u03bcm diameter) and cargo (proteins, enzymes, oligonucleotides, etc.), and poor in vivo pharmacokinetics. 6 LNPs are a desirable alternative to EVs, as they are monodisperse and abundant due to scalable manufacturing processes. Moreover, there are now examples of LNPs carrying therapeutic payloads that improve angiogenesis 7 and reduce scar size 8 in MI animal models. Nonetheless, when delivered systemically, LNPs generally lack tissue specificity, which reduces the efficacy of targeted therapeutics. Accordingly, there have been recent efforts to improve LNP homing using engineered lipid mimetics, which have achieved improved specificity to the liver, the lung, or the spleen. 9 \u221211 However, systematic delivery of LNPs targeting the heart 12 still exhibits off-target effects and has been found in other organs.

            "text": "A number of recent studies have demonstrated that LNP systems accumulate in various cell types within the liver [49,50,143,159]. Important physicochemical characteristics that modulate intrahepatic LNP distribution and activity are particle size, apparent pKa value (and resulting surface charge), and lipase sensitivity [159]. For clinical utility, it is also expected that these formulations display high entrapment efficiencies.\n\nA recent study by Chen et al. investigated how LNP size (30 nm -120 nm) influences gene silencing in hepatocytes [153]. A clear hierarchy in gene silencing potency was observed with LNP-siRNA systems around 80 nm exhibiting maximum activity (78 nm > 42 nm > 38 nm >> 27 nm > 117 nm). This LNP size optimum results from a combination of two factors: 1) smaller particles being less active (less stable and less fusogenic); and 2) larger particles (>100 nm), not being able to access hepatocytes (limited by fenestrations). Sato et al. verified these results demonstrating significant reduction in hepatocyte gene silencing for LNP-siRNA sizes above the average liver fenestrae diameters [159]. Interestingly, similar gene silencing activity in LSECs was observed for LNP-siRNA sizes up to 200 nm. This suggests that LNP sizes between 120 nm to 200 nm could be used for LSEC targeting.\n\nA key advance during the development of Onpattro\u00ae for hepatocyte gene silencing was identifying an optimized ionizable cationic lipid with an apparent pKa between 6.2 and 6.5 [17,31]. Further increasing the pKa value to 7.15 resulted in improved gene silencing in LSECs [159,160]. Incorporating ionizable cationic lipids exhibiting higher pKa values increased accumulation in the MPS, most likely due to scavenger receptor recognition [159].\n\nThe lipid sensitivity to phospholipase is another important factor modulating intrahepatic LNP distribution and activity. Three different lipases have been described including the lipoprotein and endothelial lipase",

            "text": "Small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapy represents a significant advancement in treating hypercholesterolemia and other chronic diseases [1][2][3][4][5][6]. By specifically targeting and silencing mRNA of key genes, such as proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), involved in lipid metabolism, siRNA can achieve precise reductions in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, effectively addressing hypercholesterolemia at a molecular level. This targeted approach minimizes off-target effects and reduces the risk of adverse reactions, providing a more favorable safety profile than traditional pharmacological therapies. \n\nThe efficacy of siRNA therapeutics depends on delivery technology, which is essential for transporting siRNA molecules to target tissues. Due to their inherent instability, unmodified siRNA requires advanced delivery systems to enhance bioavailability and ensure cellular uptake [7][8][9][10]. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have emerged as a promising approach, offering advantages in encapsulation efficiency and reduced immunogenicity. Effective Ivyspring International Publisher delivery protects siRNA from degradation and optimizes tissue localization, ultimately enhancing therapeutic outcomes for hypercholesterolemia and other chronic diseases [11][12][13][14][15]. Continued innovation in delivery technologies is essential for advancing siRNA therapies into clinical practice. \n\nLNPs delivering siRNA can be refined into multiple biological processes, each with distinct property requirements. During the siRNA loading phase, LNPs typically require a stronger positive charge to enhance their interaction with siRNA [16][17][18]. However, in the bloodstream, LNPs must maintain a neutral charge to prevent non-specific protein adsorption, which can lead to clearance and toxicity [19]. LNPs naturally target the liver as an RNA drug delivery system [20][21][22]. However, a stronger positive charge is necessary on their surface during endosomal escape within hepatocytes.",

Clinical advances enable the prenatal diagnosis of genetic diseases that are candidates for gene and enzyme therapies such as messenger RNA (mRNA)\u2013mediated protein replacement. Prenatal mRNA therapies can treat disease before the onset of irreversible pathology with high therapeutic efficacy and safety due to the small fetal size, immature immune system, and abundance of progenitor cells. However, the development of nonviral platforms for prenatal delivery is nascent. We developed a library of ionizable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for in utero mRNA delivery to mouse fetuses. We screened LNPs for luciferase mRNA delivery and identified formulations that accumulate within fetal livers, lungs, and intestines with higher efficiency and safety compared to benchmark delivery systems, DLin-MC3-DMA and jetPEI. We demonstrate that LNPs can deliver mRNAs to induce hepatic production of therapeutic secreted proteins. These LNPs may provide a platform for in utero mRNA delivery for protein replacement and gene editing.",

            "text": "Genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of USP20 reduces body weight, increases energy expenditure, and improves glucose clearance. Hence, USP20 is a promising target for treatment of metabolic syndrome (12,13). \n\nThe nucleic acid-based therapeutic methods have been widely used to treat a variety of diseases (14)(15)(16)(17)(18). The short-interfering RNA (siRNA) is composed of double-stranded RNA molecules that are usually 21-23 nucleotides in length and have the ability to silence the expression of specific genes (19,20). To improve siRNA stability and targeting affinity, chemical modifications and advanced delivery technologies such as lipid nanoparticle (LNP) systems have been developed (21). LNPs are the most clinically advanced nonviral vectors and have gained widespread acceptance as a result of the successful use of mRNA vaccines developed by Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech and siRNA therapeutics by Alnylam (22)(23)(24). LNPs encapsulate siRNA molecules in a lipid-based nanoparticle to protect the siRNA from degradation in the bloodstream while facilitating its uptake by target cells (25,26). The siRNA-LNP complex can be designed to be highly specific for liver or can be engineered to target tissues or cells beyond hepatocytes (27,28). For instance, the first liver-targeting siRNA medicine was created by wrapping siRNA in MC3-siRNA targeting transthyretin (TTR) LNPs made up of four components: Dlin-MC3-DMA, cholesterol, DSPC, and PEG2000-DMG as carriers (29). This drug was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2018 for the treatment of hereditary amyloidogenic transthyretin amyloidosis (30). The LNP technology is used to deliver TTR siRNA into hepatocytes cells, preventing mutant TTR protein production and subsequent fibril formation (31).",

            "text": "Introduction Lipid based nanoparticles (LNPs) are clinically successful vectors for hepatic delivery of nucleic acids. These systems are being developed for non-hepatic delivery of mRNA for the treatment of diseases like cystic fibrosis or retinal degeneration as well as infectious diseases. Localized delivery to the lungs requires aerosolization. We hypothesized that structural lipids within LNPs would provide features of integrity which can be tuned for attributes required for efficient hepatic and non-hepatic gene delivery. Herein, we explored whether naturally occurring lipids that originate from the cell membrane of plants and microorganisms enhance mRNA-based gene transfection in vitro and in vivo and whether they assist in maintaining mRNA activity after nebulization. Methods We substituted DSPC, a structural lipid used in a conventional LNP formulation, to a series of naturally occurring membrane lipids. We measured the effect of these membrane lipids on size, encapsulation efficiency and their impact on transfection efficiency. We further characterized LNPs after nebulization and measured whether they retained their transfection efficiency. Results One plant-derived structural lipid, DGTS, led to a significant improvement in liver transfection of mRNA. DGTS LNPs had similar transfection ability when administered in the nasal cavity to conventional LNPs. In contrast, we found that DGTS LNPs had reduced transfection efficiency in cells pre-and post-nebulization while maintaining size and encapsulation similar to DSPC LNPs. Conclusions We found that structural lipids provide differential mRNA-based activities in vitro and in vivo which also depend on the mode of administration. Understanding influence of structural lipids on nanoparticle morphology and structure can lead to engineering potent materials for mRNA-based gene therapy applications.",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles, the classic delivery systems for nucleic acid transfer, have been extensively studied. Nucleic acids with negative charges and lipids with positive charges form a complex by hostguest interactions and electrostatic interactions and are then taken up by endocytosis. Nanoparticles deliver plasmids or mRNAs and can protect them from nuclease degradation. LNPs can transport small interfering RNA (siRNA) and mRNA, which has been extensively validated in preclinical experiments and clinical studies. However, the editing efficiency of using LNPs to package CRISPR/Cas9 plasmids has not met the clinical requirements because their delivery efficiency to primary cells or in vivo animal experiments is low. Modification of the lipid nanodrug delivery system could significantly improve its delivery efficiency. \n\nThe difficulties in controlling their size, uniformity, and stability severely limit local administration of LNPs in vivo, such as to the inner ear, muscle, brain, and tumors. At present, developing stable nanoparticles for systemic delivery of RNPs to target organs is still challenging. Researchers have developed a universal engineering method to maintain the integrity of RNP by adding permanent cationic supplements (such as DOTAP) to ionizable LNP formulations. The lipid components mediate the encapsulation of C RNPs with retained activity and redirect DNA editing to the target tissues, so that low-dose intravenous injections can effectively target specific tissues, including the sphincter muscles, brain, liver, and lungs (Wei et al., 2020). \n\nBiodegradable lipid-like nanoparticles (LLNs) are functionalized liposomes that effectively deliver CRISPR/Cas9 cargoes and reduce liposome biological toxicity. Zhang et al. (2017) designed and synthesized a series of biodegradable lipid-like compounds containing ester groups to deliver Cas9 mRNA in vitro and in vivo. Studies have also demonstrated that biodegradable lipids in the intracellular environment can improve liposome escape and cargo release. Therefore, integrating reducible disulfide bonds into the hydrophobic tail of lipids can improve their gene delivery efficiency and promote endosomal escape.",

            "text": "In vivo, LNPs quickly adsorb plasma proteins to form a protein corona, showing a particular affinity for soluble apolipoprotein E (ApoE). This interaction promotes the binding of LNPs to low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLr), which are highly expressed on the hepatocytes. Receptor-mediated endocytosis is a key mechanism for the internalization of LNPs by hepatocytes, partially explaining the preferential targeting of the liver by intravenously administered LNPs (Liu et al., 2023). The widespread clinical application of gene therapy has been impeded by the absence of delivery vectors capable of inducing protein expression in extrahepatic organs and tissues (LoPresti et al., 2022). Recent efforts have redirected nucleic acid delivery towards tissues beyond the liver (Kimura and Harashima, 2023). The type and proportion of helper lipids can modify the LNP structure, are essential for the stability and tissue targeting of LNPs. For instance, ester and amide bonds in lipid compounds enhance targeting to the liver and lungs, respectively. Samuel T. LoPresti et al. observed that the complete substitution of conventional helper lipids with anionic or cationic lipids led to significant and consistent transfer of lipid nanoparticles specifically to the spleen or lung, respectively (LoPresti et al., 2022). Beyond their role as delivery components, lipids may exert therapeutic effects synergistically with mRNA-encoded proteins. Multifunctional lipid materials encompass self-adjuvant lipids that enhance vaccine efficacy and paclitaxel-derived lipids enabling the combined treatment of chemotherapy and gene therapy for cancer (Hou et al., 2021;Johnson et al., 2022).",

These nanoparticles, capable of encapsulating therapeutic agents in aqueous or lipid-based cores, improve drug stability, reduce side effects, and target specific cells, such as cancer cells [128]. These nanocarriers have been well known for many years and are primarily composed of natural materials, making them biocompatible, biodegradable, and safe for therapeutic use [129]. They are particularly valuable in cancer therapy due to their ability to cross the BBB, a critical feature for treating brain tumors like GBM [62,130]. In addition to GBM, LNPs are also promising for drug delivery and imaging in neurological conditions like Parkinson's disease [131][132][133], Alzheimer's disease [134], and strokes [135,136]. Their structure enables drug-controlled release, reducing toxicity and enhancing therapeutic effectiveness. LNPs provide a stable delivery platform for targeted cancer therapy, improving the precision and effectiveness of drug delivery [137]. The primary limitation of LNPs is their tendency to fuse, especially when the average size of the synthesized formulation is below 100 nm. This fusion leads to the leakage of encapsulated substances from the lipid vesicles and enhances dispersibility. However, this issue can be addressed by applying a PEG coating to the surface of the lipid nanoparticles [138]. Ionic liquids (ILs), such as choline-2-hexenoic acid, can further enhance tissue-specific drug delivery by facilitating LNP transport across the BBB using intravenous delivery. ILs help modulate the interaction of LNPs with serum proteins, potentially increasing drug accumulation at the BBB through red blood cell hitchhiking [139]. Originally focused on liver targets, LNPs have demonstrated high encapsulation efficiencies for macromolecules such as siRNA and mRNA [140][141][142] and are now being explored for CNS applications.",

Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) in particular offer a wide array of possibilities due to their modularity, biocompatibility and capacity to encapsulate various therapeutic payloads, ranging from small molecules to nucleic acids such as small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) (Evers et al., 2018;Hou et al., 2021;Samaridou et al., 2020;Kulkarni et al., 2017;Cullis and Hope, 2017;Pozzi and Caracciolo, 2023). siRNAs hold great potential for targeted therapeutic interventions in oncology by selectively silencing genes of interest (Charbe et al., 2020). \n\nNevertheless, the effective translation of siRNA-based therapeutics to clinical applications faces significant challenges, with intracellular delivery and concomitant endosomal escape being paramount hurdles (Hu et al., 2020). Encapsulation of siRNAs into LNPs offers a viable solution, protecting the payload from degradation and facilitating cellular entry (Jayaraman et al., 2012). Despite their potential, the clinical translation of nanoparticles for cancer treatment has been hampered by challenges related to their rapid clearance from the bloodstream by the reticuloendothelial system (RES), leading to limited systemic circulation and reduced accumulation at the tumor site (Wilhelm et al., 2016;Zhang et al., 2016;El Moukhtari et al., 2023;Gomes-da-Silva et al., 2012). \n\nThe RES plays an essential role in immune surveillance and the clearance of foreign particles from the blood (Iio and Wagner, 1963;Wagner and Iio, 1964), with key cells including Kupffer cells, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), and splenic macrophages (Shi et al., 2011).",

            "text": "LNPs are effective in targeting the liver; however, to understand their localization, it is important to distinguish biodistribution from functional delivery. This distinction helps clarify how LNPs can target specific organs such as the liver while guaranteeing the therapeutic cargo is effectively delivered in the target cells. 32,52 Biodistribution is the process of LNPs accumulating in specific tissues after entering circulation, while functional delivery depends on the successful release and action of the therapeutic cargo (e.g., mRNA or small interfering RNA [siRNA]) in target cells. 53 This distinction is important because LNPs can accumulate in tissues such as the liver without producing intended therapeutic effects. \n\nFunctional delivery may be impaired by factors such as inadequate endosomal escape or protein corona, 54 which can drive LNP accumulation in non-target cells while hindering cellular uptake and effective intracellular delivery in target cells. Proteomic analyses have shown that the composition of the protein corona can affect nanoparticlecell interactions, altering both the distribution and efficacy of the delivery system by influencing receptor recognition and endocytosis mechanisms. 55 Functional delivery is also impacted by challenges in intracellular trafficking and cargo release once inside cells. [58] Several studies have demonstrated rapid liver accumulation of LNPs within minutes of administration, largely due to the liver's extensive blood flow and porous endothelium. 24,35,59 However, this high level of accumulation does not directly translate to efficient functional www.moleculartherapy.org Review delivery. Recent work by Lam et al. 60 showed that while LNPs of different sizes can accumulate similarly in the liver, their functional delivery to hepatocytes varies between species. In non-human primates, smaller LNPs (50-60 nm) showed approximately 5-fold higher protein expression in liver compared with conventional larger particles (70-80 nm). More importantly, both formulations exhibited similar pharmacokinetic profiles and liver accumulation. This finding demonstrates that the liver microarchitecture, for example, the size of liver fenestrae, which are smaller in primates than rodents, is important for efficient delivery. This result is further supported by Sato et al., 61 who showed that uptake mechanisms in hepatocytes vary based on ionizable lipid structure.",

            "text": "The size and composition of LNPs can help the endothelium-specific delivery; however, the detailed mechanism of cell-specific uptake is not well understood. Therefore, targeting specific cells in the liver requires an alternative strategy other than adjusting the physical size and composition of the LNPs. Ligand incorporation can be an ideal approach for selective delivery of RNA therapeutics to targeted liver cells. LSECs play an important role in scavenger system and express selective receptors such as stabilin receptors, mannose receptors, and Fc-\uf067RIIb2 (17). These receptors are involved in the removal of blood-borne antigens by active endocytosis. For example, phosphorothioate-modified antisense oligonucleotides or hyaluronic acid-conjugated nanoparticles were successfully delivered to LSECs by targeting the scavenger receptors (24,25). \n\nIn this study, we report the engineered LNP formulations for the targeted delivery of RNA into different types of cells in the liver. Hepatocytes and LSECs are two major cells involved in various liver-related diseases. Hepatocytes are often associated with rare diseases in metabolism and endocrine dysfunctions, while LSECs are closely related with chronic liver diseases such as liver fibrosis and cirrhosis (19,26,27). It is important to selectively target the liver cells in different diseases, and its selectivity becomes more critical when introducing in vivo gene regulation and editing. Here, ionizable lipids were first synthesized and screened for their pK a (where K a is the acid dissociation constant) and endolytic activities. Selected lipid candidates were further evaluated for in vitro and in vivo gene expression after formulating LNPs with reporter mRNA [firefly luciferase (FLuc)]. Targeted delivery of LNPs with mRNA (Cre) in different types of cells in the liver was examined by controlling the particle size and PEG-lipid content of LNPs. In addition, engineered LNPs with mannose moieties were prepared for active targeting of LSECs. Optimized condition for the targeted delivery of mRNA to LSECs was lastly confirmed.",

Biodistributions of injected LNPs in mice were measured by fluorescence bioimaging or liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. In addition, luciferase expression levels were determined by bioluminescence imaging and enzyme activity assays. Some intramuscularly injected LNPs were found circulating in the system, resulting in accumulation in the liver and spleen, especially when the LNP sizes were relatively small. Bigger LNPs were more likely to remain at the injection site. Transgene expression in the liver was found most prominent compared with other organs and tissues. Biomolecules such as mRNAs encapsulated in locally injected LNPs can reach other organs and tissues via systemic circulation.

Cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryoTEM) imaging of LNPs with lipid 20a revealed slightly elongated and more hydrophobic particles (the latter indicated by preferential deposition on the carbon support material; Fig. 2D) than LNPs with lipid 20b, likely due to the saturated lipid tail. \n\nTriple Lipid Tails. We then explored the option of adding a third lipid tail to the thiophene linker. Instead of pursuing modifications of 11d, a minor acylation byproduct that led to lipid 16dc, we opted out to incorporate an amide at 3-position of the thiophene ring for a more convenient tail conjugation. Comparing the characteristics of 26a,b LNPs against 16dc revealed that LNPs containing triple-tail lipids still could form small but relatively heterogeneous nanoparticles with great mRNA encapsulation efficiency (Fig. 2 A and B). In vitro mRNA transfection data revealed that 16dc LNPs were the most potent in HeLa, 26a LNPs in the HepG2, and 26b LNPs in HEK293 (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). Notably, only 26a LNPs could transfect the liver from intravenous administration but to a lesser extent than 20a,b LNPs (Fig. 2F). It was also not as potent as lipid 16dc in intramuscular delivery (SI Appendix, Fig. S2). Therefore, there may not be a significant delivery benefit from adding a third lipid tail. \n\nRearrangement of the Building Blocks. Next, we investigated the arrangement of the building blocks. We separated the lipid tails to the opposing sides of the thiophene core and modified the ester to carry the ionizable headgroup. The resulting lipid 29d maintained the capability to form robust LNPs, although somewhat heterogeneous in shape and internal structure (Fig. 2D).",

The effects of particle size and polyethylene glycol\u2013lipid content in the LNPs were evaluated for the hepatocyte-specific delivery of mRNA by ApoE-mediated cellular uptake through low-density lipoprotein receptors. Targeted delivery of RNA to LSECs was further investigated using active ligands. Incorporation of mannose allowed the selective delivery of RNA to LSECs, while minimizing the unwanted cellular uptake by hepatocytes.

            "text": "Intravenous administration of lipid nanoparticles has been the most common route to deliver therapeutic genes to endothelial cells, as these cells are located in the inner surface of blood vessels and are in direct contact with the blood. However, when nanoparticles enter the blood circulation, they are often eliminated by cells of the reticuloendothelial system or preferentially transfect hepatocytes, which prevents nanoparticles from reaching and transfecting endothelial cells [69,94,[186][187][188][189]. As such, strategies have been developed to bypass hepatocytes in order to reach and transfect endothelial cells. Among the strategies developed, the use of cationic lipids or polymers to generate nanoparticles that target endothelial cells has made considerable progress. Dorkin et al. showed that incorporation of the permanently cationic lipid, DOTAP, to LNPs that otherwise target the liver could be redirected to transfect pulmonary endothelial cells [182]. Dorkin et al. also found that liver-targeted lipid nanoparticles, which are nanoparticles that preferentially transfect hepatocytes on their own, specifically C12-200, cKK-E12, and 503O13 nanoparticles, could have a shift in their tropism and transfect pulmonary endothelial cells by incorporating the lipid DOTAP in their formulation [182]. This finding was later expanded by Cheng et al. to include additional cationic lipids, such as DDAB and EPC, to other liver-targeted nanoparticles like 5A2-SC8 and DLin-MC3-DMA to enable transfection of pulmonary endothelial cells [181]. The mechanism by which these nanoparticles target and deliver nucleic acids to the lung may be due to association with a protein or group of proteins that binds to the surface of the nanoparticles and selectively delivers them to the pulmonary endothelium [95,190]. For example, lipid compositions can shift the protein corona abundance away from ApoE, which is a recognized driver of hepatocyte LNP uptake and transfection [191",

Our ongoing research focuses on formulation optimization to further enhance the delivery efficacy and minimize the liver toxicity of the RNP-LNP system. We expect by designing and incorporating gRNAs that target functional genes in the liver tissue, these bioreducible LNPs can be used for creating new therapeutics for liver-associated diseases or disorders through liverspecific genome editing 90 . \n\nIn addition to modifying the disulfide-containing bioreducible LNPs (e.g., tuning the alkyl chain length of OnB tails and incorporating non-linear cholesteryl moiety into the tail structure), we tried to introduce new building blocks into combinatorial lipid synthesis to investigate if new and better delivery performance could be achieved. In one study, we integrated ether, thiol ether, and selenide ether moieties into lipid hydrophobic tails (termed as R-O17O, R-O17S, and R-O17Se) and investigated how the hetero atom affects the intracellular delivery efficacy of genome engineering proteins (Fig. 4D) 88 . Using the GFP-Cre recombinase and DsRed-HeLa cell line, we found that the combinatorial lipids with O17Se tails outperformed the O17O and O17S lipids (Fig. 4E and  F). These results revealed that even the one-atom difference in lipid tail structure can have huge impact on the intracellular delivery performance of lipid nanoparticles. Further investigation revealed that the lipids with high apparent pK a (i.e., pK a >5.1 in TNS (2-(p-toluidinynaphthalene-6-sulphonic acid)) assay) and high phospholipid membrane disruption capabilities (indicated as OD 405 > 0.2 in hemolysis assay) are more likely to induce success intracellular protein delivery, and many of the O17Se LNPs possess these two characteristics.",

            "text": "RNA interference (RNAi) is a fundamental eukaryotic mechanism that induces targeted mRNA degradation, which is mediated by small interfering RNA (siRNA). 1 RNAi-based therapeutic agents can potentially inhibit \"undruggable\" molecules that are difficult to target with small molecule compounds and antibodies. 2 Developing siRNA delivery systems that overcome properties of siRNA that make them easily degraded by nucleases in vivo is indispensable for using RNAibased therapeutic drugs. 3,4  2018, the first siRNA-based medicine was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration. 5,6 This drug utilizes lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) as the siRNA carrier. LNPs efficiently deliver siRNA to the cytoplasm and are mainly composed of ionizable lipids, phospholipids, cholesterol, and polyethylene glycol (PEG) lipids that protect siRNA from nucleases. 7,8 The characteristics of LNPs are largely dependent on the types of ionizable lipids. 7,9 Ionizable lipids are critical for endosomal disruption and siRNA release from LNPs in target cells, 9 but they can cause cytotoxicity due to non-specific binding to proteins. 7 There are various types of ionizable lipids, such as symmetric ionizable lipids, 10 asymmetric ionizable lipids, 11 and lipidoids. 12 Among them, asymmetric ionizable lipids effectively lead to target gene silencing and are less cytotoxic than other ionizable lipids. 11,13,14 Recently, we developed biodegradable LNPs comprised of novel ionizable lipids, L120, with an asymmetric lipid tail. 15 The ester bond in the ionizable lipid tail is hydrolyzed in vivo, leading to rapid lipid degradation and reduced cytotoxicity. We have shown that our biodegradable LNPs were successfully incorporated into liver hepatocytes and led to effective knockdown of target mRNA expression. 15",

            "text": "According to diverse target tissues, the proportions of these four lipid components can be adjusted to change the LNP constitution (Yihunie et al., 2023). At the same time, the physical characteristics of LNPs, like particle size, morphology, encapsulation rate, and surface charge are prone to be regulated, thus producing a variety of different LNP formulations (Yang et al., 2022;Suzuki and Ishihara, 2021). Ionizable lipid nanoparticles display excellent biocompatibility, high nucleic acid encapsulation efficiency, and efficient transfection performance, releasing only under specific circumstances with low off-target effects (Yang et al., 2022). Nowadays, LNPs have become the most widely explored and applied non-viral nucleic acid delivery vector (Sun and Lu, 2023). Now the focus is on how to improve the delivery effect of LNPs. Modifying the surface of LNPs with targeted molecular entities becomes the most popular way (Subhan et al., 2023). In principle, peptides, antibodies, or proteins that target specific cell surface molecules are added to nanoparticles carrying mRNA to block liver accumulation and enable particular mRNA transport to target cells through high-affinity binding (Kedmi et al., 2018;FIGURE 4 The Delivery mechanism of lipid nanoparticles (Suzuki and Ishihara, 2021). First, the lipid nanoparticles (LNP) completely encapsulated the RNA and prevented it from nuclease digestion. LNPs are neutral in physiological pH due to ionizable lipids and pegylated phospholipids, thus reducing non-specific interactions with serum proteins. Second, LNPs are taken up by cells via apolipoprotein E (ApoE) dependent and/or ApoE independent pathways when the pegylated phospholipids are dissociated. Finally, the protonated LNPs, after acidification in the endosomes, induce the hexagonal phase structure, destroy the cell membrane, and release RNA molecules into the cytoplasm. Yang et al., 2022).",

            "text": "Previously reported studies of AR siRNA utilized LNPs containing PEG-DMG, a PEG-lipid with two C 14 alkyl chains. 1 PEG-lipids are required to produce LNP systems with defined sizes 33 and to prevent aggregation of the LNP after formation. 34 As noted elsewhere, 13,14 PEG-lipids with C 14 chains rapidly dissociate from the LNP (dissociation halftimes of minutes or less) following in vivo administration and result in short circulation lifetimes, enhancing liver accumulation but reducing LNP accumulation at tumor sites. In order to improve tumor accumulation, LNP systems used in this work incorporated PEG-DSG, a lipid with C 18 alkyl chains. Previous work has shown that PEG-lipids with C 18 alkyl chains remain associated with LNP for days or longer, 14 leading to extended circulation lifetimes following i.v. administration relative to those with shorter PEG chains. 13,14,35 Consistent with these reports, 35 we found that LNP-siRNA, produced by microfluidic mixing incorporating 1.5% PEG-DSG, exhibited extended circulation properties compared to LNP with equivalent amounts of PEG-DMG. 14 ncreasing the total PEG-DSG lipid in the LNP from 2.5 to 5% resulted in a marked increase in circulation halftime from approximately 30 minutes to greater than 8 hours (Figure 5). To show that increased circulation lifetime translates to enhanced LNP accumulation in tumors, fluorescently labeled LNP-AR21-siRNA containing either 2.5 or 5 mol% PEG-DSG were prepared and administered intravenously once every day for 3 days at a dose of 10 mg siRNA/kg body weight in athymic nude mice bearing LNCaP tumors. Tumors were harvested at 4 and 24 hours following the final injection of LNP formulations, fixed in 10% formalin, cryosectioned, and analyzed for LNP accumulation by confocal microscopy. Consistent with the enhanced circulation lifetime, tumor tissues from mice treated with LNP containing 5 mol% PEG-DSG showed significantly higher accumulation of fluorescence than those from mice injected with LNP containing 2.5 mol% PEG-DSG (Figure 2b).",

            "text": "Typically, the reticuloendothelial system in the liver provides spaces large enough to allow the entry of these relatively large nanoparticles. 175 The absence of a positive surface charge in plasma results in maximal delivery to hepatocytes and uptake by hepatocytes via ApoE-dependent, receptor-mediated endocytosis. 176 Previously, LNPs administered intravenously or intramuscularly showed very strong vaccine accumulation in the liver, which triggered serious postvaccination liver injury. 177 Thus, a delivery system capable of targeting or bypassing and rapidly metabolizing in the liver is needed. In this setting, many targeted delivery systems have been launched. For example, a study screened and optimized the structures of head amines, linker types, tail lengths, and tail combinations in LNP, formulating a novel LNP named 113-O12B that can perform targeted delivery of RNA to lymph node (LN) organs, which prevents hepatic damage and T-cell-dominant immune-mediated hepatitis. 178 As the largest secondary lymphoid organ and host of a wide range of immunologic functions, the spleen is an irreplaceable terminus of vaccines. A novel LNP named YK009-LNP shows a favorable biodistribution pattern in the spleen and the primarily skeletal muscle site of injection, which contains abundant macrophages and other immune cells, exhibiting a faster elimination rate and low toxicity in the liver. 179 xceptionally, AX4-LNPs were further formulated with leading tailbranches, three coformulated excipient lipid molecules, and the incorporation of degradable linkers such as ester bonds into the aliphatic tails of lipidoids, forming a low-immunogenicity degradable LNP delivery system with a much faster elimination rate in the liver and spleen. This degradable LNP was successfully applied in vivo to deliver a circRNA vaccine and contribute to eliciting a robust immune response. 28 Above all, this is beneficial for delivery studies of circRNA vaccines, and more clinical studies need to be conducted. \n\nThe delivery of agents into dendritic cells (DCs) is an alternative way to present antigens and control side effects.",

The results showed that intravenous delivery is the most commonly used route, demonstrating its effectiveness in targeting liver cells. Key observations, listed below, show the influence of lipid components, surface chemistry, and target cell interactions. \n\n(1) Ionizable lipids contributed to increased endosomal escape and liver-specific delivery. Lipids, such as MC3 and cKK-E12, had specific pKa values optimized for hepatocyte uptake. 32,67 Importantly, tail length affected organ distribution. For example, shorter tails targeted the spleen, and longer tails favored liver uptake. 67 Formulations such as 5A2-SC8 and 3A5-SC14 showed different targeting behavior; e.g., 5A2-SC8 enhanced ApoEmediated hepatocyte delivery, while 3A5-SC14 favored Kupffer cell uptake. 36 2) Helper lipids, such as DOPE and DSPC, impacted biodistribution. For example, DOPE improved ApoE-mediated liver uptake, while DSPC directed transport to the spleen, showing how fine-tuning LNPs allowed for specific targeting. 23,24 3) Cholesterol stabilizes LNPs and also influences targeting. Esterified cholesterol improved endothelial delivery, while oxidized cholesterol favored Kupffer cells and immune cells, reducing hepatocyte interaction. 68,69 Cationic cholesterol further facilitated delivery to both the liver and extrahepatic tissues, e.g., the lungs and heart. 70 (4) Surface chemistry was important for targeting efficiency. PEG lipids improved circulation, while sheddable variants (e.g., pH-sensitive or enzymatically cleavable PEG) helped target the liver. Mannose-PEG, on the other hand, enhanced receptor-specific delivery to LSECs. 23 pH-sensitive PEGylated lipids increased the stability of the formulation and enabled efficient liver genome editing. 71 Siloxane-incorporated lipidoids also improved endosomal escape and liver-specific mRNA delivery. 72",

A similar intrahepatic distribution has recently been described for LNP-DNA barcode systems (composed of MC3 or cKK-E12) by Sago et al. [50]. However, direct comparison of datasets carried out with different LNP systems, including variations in the lipid composition, ionizable lipid, lipid-nucleic acid ratios, and nucleic acid type must be assessed with caution. At a dose of 0.3 mg DNA /kg, LNPs accumulated in all three major liver cell types, with higher doses in Kupffer cells and hepatocytes than endothelial cells. In sharp contrast, gene expression following LNP-mediated mRNA delivery demonstrated an inverse hierarchy among hepatic cells: endothelial cells > Kupffer cells > hepatocytes. Higher LNP doses corresponding to 1 mg/kg mRNA shifted expression slightly towards hepatocytes while keeping the same pattern. Transfection of all major liver cell types with equal potency was recently demonstrated for LNP-mRNA systems (composed of branched-tail 306O i10 ) at a dose of 2 mg RNA/kg by Hajj et al. [51].\n\nIndeed, targeting the right cell type with the right dose is crucial to developing effective therapeutics. It should be noted that the LNP compositions described in these preclinical studies deviate from those used in the clinic (except for MC3-based LNPs). Systematic studies are therefore needed to improve our fundamental understanding of LNPs' in vivo behavior. Rigorous control of physicochemical LNP characteristics such as size distribution, zeta potential, and entrapment will be crucial to assess the intrahepatic distribution of a single LNP composition with different payloads.",

Ultimately, however, the discrete pathways by which tuning the physicochemical properties of formulation components directs LNPs to selectively traffic and express in certain organs and tissues require more detailed mechanistic studies to establish.\n\nThe physicochemical properties of the LNP system also impacts its interactions with serum proteins and consequent formation of a 'protein corona' which further determines particle fate in vivo . A protein corona composed of plasma opsonins, such as fibrinogen, IgG, and complement factors, for example, usually promotes rapid clearance of particles from the circulation [ 203 ]. In contrast, adsorption of plasma proteins like apolipoproteins elongate particle circulation half-lives and enhances interaction with LDL receptors, which facilitate accumulation of the particles in the liver and transportation across the blood-brain barrier [ 46 , 204 ]. Lipoproteins such as ApoE have been utilized for siRNA-LNP decoration due to their capacity to induce internalization into hepatocytes [171] , with interactions between ApoE-bound LNPs and heparan sulfate proteoglycans shown to further promote rapid uptake [205] , and albumin coating has recently been harnessed for mRNA-LNP delivery to the liver through apolipoprotein E (ApoE) independent cellular pathways [ 206 ]. Varying the proportion of charged and zwitterionic lipids at the surface of a lipid system has been reported to change the quantity and identity of the most abundant serum proteins [207] ; as such, controlling protein corona formation could present a strategy for specific targeting in vivo .\n\nLNPs may also be directly modified with a specific targeting agent in order to facilitate localization to the desired tissue or organ for more effective immunization.

            "text": "7][8] Because mutated proteins are produced in specific cells, there is a critical need to develop organ specific delivery strategies to reach the full potential of genomic medicines. Non-viral synthetic nanoparticles represent a safe and efficacious approach that allows repeated administrations. Among carriers, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) represent a broad class of materials that can deliver therapeutic nucleic acids to the liver, 2, 4, 9 including a recently FDA-approved siRNA LNP therapy for transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis called Onpattro. 10 Despite these advances, it is currently impossible to predictably and rationally design nanoparticles for delivery to targeted tissues beyond the liver. \n\nWe report a strategy termed Selective ORgan Targeting (SORT) that allows nanoparticles to be systematically engineered for accurate delivery of diverse cargoes including mRNA, Cas9 mRNA / sgRNA, and Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes to the lungs, spleens, and livers of mice following intravenous (IV) administration (Fig. 1a). Traditional LNPs are composed of ionizable cationic lipids, amphipathic phospholipids, cholesterol, and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) lipids. Here we show that addition of a supplemental component (termed a SORT molecule) precisely alters the in vivo RNA delivery profile and mediates tissue-specific gene delivery and editing as a function of the percentage and biophysical property of the added SORT molecule. In this work, we provide evidences for tissue-specific delivery, establish that this methodology is applicable to various nanoparticle systems, and provide a new method for predictable LNP design to target therapeutically relevant cells. \n\n][13] This exhaustive focus on ionizable cationic lipids has produced highly effective carriers for liver hepatocytes, but has not yielded effective carriers capable of reaching other organs.",

[12,13] One of the biggest breakthroughs of siRNA therapeutics was the approval of the first siRNA-LNP drug, Onpattro\u00ae (Patisiran) by the FDA (Food and Drug Association, USA) and EMA (European Medicines Agency). Onpattro\u00ae consists of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) encapsulating siRNA in its lipid matrix to treat hereditary amyloidogenic transthyretin (TTR) amyloidosis. [14,15] The target is the liver after intravenous administration. Recently, LNP technology has also enabled the rapid development and approval of mRNAbased vaccines against COVID-19. [16] These types of LNPs consist of phospholipids, cholesterol, polyethylene glycol-conjugated lipids, and ionizable helper lipids. Ionizable helper lipids bind to anionic RNA to enable efficient encapsulation and promote endosomal escape following internalization into the target cell. [17] The major advantage of LNP technology is its adaptability to different siRNA payloads as its physicochemical properties remain similar. [18] Therefore, LNP formulations can potentially be pursued to deliver therapeutic cargoes via different administrative routes for the treatment of a large variety of diseases. \n\nThe lungs are one of the most complex organs and offers advantages of local, over systemic, delivery such as noninvasive access and a large alveolar surface area. [19] Furthermore, the administered dose can be reduced for local effects compared to systemic delivery, resulting in decreased side effects. Regarding RNA delivery to the lungs, the absence of serum proteins on the air-side keeps the nuclease activity relatively low. [20] Therefore, drugs can most effectively be delivered by inhalation and are immediately available to the lungs. [21,22] In order to deliver drugs or nanoparticles to the lungs, incorporation into microparticles with aerodynamic diameters between 1 and 5 \u03bcm are required.",

            "text": "PK and BD data for siRNA LNPs indicate that the mechanism of LNP removal from the circulation does not exhibit the same PEG-lipid threshold effect as seen for hepatic gene silencing. At 1.5 mol % PEG-lipid the circulation half-life of 14 C-MC3-labeled LNPs (estimated over 24 hours) for PEG-C14, -C16, and -C18 LNPs is 0.64, 2.18, and 4.03 hours respectively. There is also a marked decrease in liver and spleen uptake with increasing chain length. These data indicate that both 1.5 mol % PEG-C16 and -C18 steric barriers reduce the association of opsonins with LNPs in the circulation. The reason for the different PEG effects for opsonin induced clearance and Apo E-mediated uptake are not known at this time, but may reflect the molecular weights of the various proteins involved and their ability to penetrate a low density PEG shield. \n\nDespite the differences in liver uptake between LNPs containing 1.5 mol % PEG-C14 and PEG-C18 they exhibit similar gene silencing activities, indicating that delivery to the liver alone is not a limiting factor for activity under these dosing conditions. As might be expected, a comparison of 14 C-MC3 to 3 H-PEG-lipid in liver shows that the amount of 3 H-label taken up reflects the rates of transfer to lipoproteins and erythrocytes while LNPs are in the circulation (Figure 5c,d). However, it is interesting to note that by 24 hours, >50% of the 3 H-PEG-C14 accumulated in the liver at 2 hours has been eliminated whereas the concentration of 3 H-PEG-C18 remains constant. The 3 H-label is located in the alkyl chains, which are joined to the headgroup by metabolically stable ether linkers. 17 Consequently, the differences in liver processing between the short and long chain PEG-lipids may also be related to lipid transfer rates and perhaps reflect PEG-C14 excretion into bile rather than metabolism.",

Studies have also demonstrated that LNPs can effectively deliver mRNA to cancer cells, resulting in significant antitumor activity [100]. LNPs can effectively protect the genetic cargo from degradation. Their ability to bypass endosomal trapping (endosomal escape), principally through membrane inversion, however, remains poor, resulting in the delivery of only ~ 2% of nucleic acids to the cytosol of target cells [111]. Another noteworthy characteristic of LNPs is their tendency to accumulate in the liver upon systemic intravenous administration, which can lead to potential liver-targeting therapeutic strategies [112] once the concern of hepatotoxicity is resolved. \n\nLipid nanoemulsions are colloidal dispersions of two immiscible liquids, typically oil (lipid) and water, stabilized by a surfactant monolayer at the interface, forming droplets ranging from 20 to 200 nm in diameter. Like other lipid-based nanocarriers, lipid nanoemulsions are well-suited for delivering hydrophobic drugs and can protect cargoes from enzymatic degradation and offer controlled release. Compared with other lipid-based nanocarriers, lipid nanoemulsions offer less expensive manufacturing, but challenges include the potential toxicity of surfactants and relatively fewer opportunities for surface modification [105]. Lipid nanoemulsions have been explored as carriers for hydrophobic drugs, including chemotherapeutic agents such as paclitaxel [113] and doxorubicin [114], phytochemicals such as curcumin [115,116], nucleic acids [117], and proteins. \n\nWhile the previously discussed lipid-based nanocarriers are liquid at body temperatures and rely on amphiphilic interactions for stability, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) include a core made of lipids with high melting temperatures. So, this solid core at body temperature offers improved encapsulation efficiency, stability, and drug-release properties compared to liposomes.",

            "text": "One major challenge in case of RNA vaccines is the targeted delivery to the specific cell types. After the synthesis of mRNA using IVT methods, it is packaged into liposomes or lipid nanoparticles. After administration, these mRNAs entered in the liver cells. Typically, absence of positive charge in the reticuloendothelial system in the liver allows the maximal delivery of mRNA vaccines to hepatocytes via ApoEdependent, receptor-mediated endocytosis [19]. It has been reported that ionized LNP are capable of delivering nucleic acids to hepatocytes by binding with Apolipoprotein E (ApoE). ApoE binds to low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLR) and delivers nucleic acids to the liver. LDLR belongs to evolutionarily conserved low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor family and are highly expressed by hepatocytes [19,20]. This is an active liver-targeting delivery mechanism. Moreover, this is a matter of concern where mRNA therapeutics require delivery of mRNA to other tissues than liver. It has also been shown that accumulation of mRNA in liver may lead to liver injury [7]. Another disadvantage is reactogenicity of LNPs. Therefore, it is wise to develop methods that can deliver mRNA at the desired site and decrease the reactogenicity of LNPs. \n\nThe key components of lipid nanoparticles are ionizable lipids, helper lipids, cholesterol and polyethylene glycol (PEG)-lipids. These components are capable of inducing several types of toxicity and reactogenicity. Cationic ionizable LNPs and cationic ionizable lipids due to their positive charge interact with the anionic RNA during particle formation and exhibit neutral charge at pH 7.4.",

Introduction Lipid nanoparticles (LNP) are invaluable carriers for drug and gene delivery, and they are classified as cationic, neutral and anionic depending on the electronic charges exist\u2010 ing on the surface of the vesicles [1]. These charges are originated from the charged lip\u2010 ids from which lipid nanoparticles are formulated. Cationic LNP are commonly used for DNA or RNA carriers due to their interaction with negatively-charged nucleotide. Both neutral and negatively-charged LNPs are used for drug delivery [2] and may be formu\u2010 lated as sterically stable LNPs (SSLNPs), which are amendable for cell type-specific or tissue-specific targeting delivery [3]. For liver drug delivery, tremendous efforts have been made to develop cell type-selective lipid-based drug carriers. Effective approaches in targeting hepatocytes, Kupffer cells and hepatic stellate cells have been evaluated in small animals [3, 4], and some of them may be translational to clinical application [5]. These approaches are referable when cationic LNPs are considered for cell type-selective gene delivery. A prerequisite for the success of gene therapy for liver disorders is the de\u2010 velopment of powerful gene carriers. Non-viral vectors have been very successful for gene transfer in an in vitro setting, in terms of efficiency of lipofection, applicability in variety of cell types, and amending ability of cell type-specific delivery (Fig. 1). The clini\u2010 cal application of LNP-mediated gene transfer has been hampered by low efficiency, in\u2010 stability in the bloodstream, short-term transgene expression and toxicity. These shortcomings are the bottle neck hindering the gene transfer employing LNPs as carriers for delivery of function gene(s) to solid organs, and are the challenges in moving from small to large animals of potential gene carriers and approaches, and in",

            "text": "Lipids are the main components of the cell membrane, thus making lipid-based NPs (LNPs) capable of interacting with the membrane, promoting cellular uptake of their contents. LNPs are composed of a lipid bilayer that contains the miRNA in the aqueous core or, in the case of multi-lamellar liposomes, between lipid bilayers [154]. Typically, miRNA-loaded LNPs are made with a mixture of cationic lipids, neutral lipids and PEG [155]. Spontaneous electrostatic interaction between cationic lipids and negatively charged miRNA results in an efficient condensation of miRNAs and in their protection from enzymatic degradation. Also, the positive charge facilitates the interaction with the opposite-charged cellular membrane [155]. However, the use of cationic lipids is commonly associated with cell toxicity, as they can disrupt cell membrane integrity, induce cytoplasm vacuolization and Table 2 Applications and therapeutic effects of nanoparticles (NPs) for delivering microRNAs (miRNAs) and/or drugs in tissue engineering (TE) and cancer. reduce cell activity [156]. Furthermore, the presence of cationic lipids can result in the interaction with negatively charged serum proteins, thus inducing aggregate formation, which are subsequently eliminated by the liver and the spleen. For these reasons, several strategies to reduce the cationic charge have been attempted. For instance, combination with neutral lipids, such as cholesterol (Chol), dioleoylphosphatidyl ethanolamine (DOPE) and phosphatidylcholine (PC), known as \"helper lipids\", has been proposed to enhance stability and reduce toxicity of LNPs [157]. PEG modifications on the LNP surface have also been implemented to increase their half-life. PEGylated cationic/neutral LNPs have been used for the systemic delivery of liver-specific tumour suppressor miR-122 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), achieving \u223c 50% decreased growth after 30 days [158].",

In addition, nucleic acids are susceptible to degradation by nucleases in the circulation, suffer from rapid renal clearance, and induce immunostimulatory effects via pattern recognition receptors, resulting in adverse effects [13]. Therefore, the clinical translation of nucleic acid therapeutics has been dependent on chemical modifications and advanced delivery technologies to improve nucleic acids' stability, promote their target tissue accumulation, enable their cellular internalization, and increase their target affinity [14].\n\nLipid nanoparticle (LNP) systems are currently one of the most sophisticated non-viral gene delivery technologies enabling gene therapies [15]. Decades of designing lipid-based delivery systems for small molecule therapeutics [16] has driven efforts in adapting LNP technology for nucleic acid delivery [17,18], particularly following the discovery of RNA interference (RNAi) [19,20]. These efforts included systematically optimizing all LNP components for efficient gene silencing and incorporating siRNA payload modification and chemistry [21,22], polyethylene glycol (PEG) lipids [23][24][25][26], helper lipids [27,28], and, particularly, ionizable cationic lipids [29][30][31].\n\nIn 2018, these developments culminated in the approval of Onpattro\u00ae (patisiran), the first RNAi drug, for treating hereditary amyloidogenic transthyretin (ATTRv) amyloidosis [32,33]. This systemic disease, which generally presents as progressive neuropathy, is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the transthyretin (TTR) protein, resulting in amyloid fibril deposition in multiple organs [34]. Onpattro\u00ae relies on LNP technology for efficient TTR siRNA delivery to hepatocytes following systemic infusion, inhibiting mutant TTR protein production and subsequent fibril formation.\n\nIn this review, we provide an overview of the lipid nanotechnologymediated gene regulation approaches in the liver for treating various diseases.

Conjugation of targeting ligands on the LNPs surface proved to be effective in facilitating the uptake by specific organs in small-scale settings. For instance, conjugated antibodies targeted against vascular cell adhesion molecules VCAM-1 or PECAM-1 and CD-4 were employed to redistribute the LNPs from liver to lung, cerebral endothelium during brain oedema and in all T cells (na\u00efve, memory, central, and effector) in both lymph and spleen, respectively [120].

Another approach examined by Saunders et al. involved the pre-treatment of mice with a liposome that occupies liver cells temporarily prior to LNP delivery; this approach reduced the uptake of tested LNP-RNA formulations by the RES and ultimately led to enhanced bioavailability of the bioactive RNA, increasing the protein production for mRNA and better silencing for siRNA [105].",

            "text": "However, studies on the impact of composition on the biofunctions of LNPs post-intramuscular administration are still lacking. Although numerous studies have been conducted on the impact of particle size, no consensus has been reached. For instance, some studies demonstrated that LNPs with a diameter of approximately 140 nm showed superior transfection both in vitro and in vivo [29], and smaller LNPs were prone to liver accumulation post-intramuscular injection [30,31]. In contrast, a prior study indicated that mRNA-LNP vaccines with distinct sizes elicited comparably robust immune responses in non-human primates [32]. It has to admit that researches on these aspects are far from comprehensive and systematic. \n\nMoreover, PEGylated lipids are implicated in the elicitation of side effects following intramuscular injection. Notably, serum anti-PEG-IgG levels have been reported to increase by 12.1 folds post-vaccination with mRNA-1273, while anti-PEG-IgM levels have surged by 67.5 folds [33]. The induction of anti-PEG antibodies by PEGylated lipids may trigger hypersensitivity reactions by activating the complement system [24,34,35]. Consequently, it is also imperative to conduct studies on the impact of both the type and content of PEGylated lipids in LNPs on transfection following intramuscular injection. \n\nIn this study, a model mRNA, luciferase mRNA (mLuc), was loaded into LNPs to elucidate the impacts of sizes, charges, and PEGylated lipids on transfection efficiency and in vivo distribution. First, LNPs with varying sizes, charges, and various contents of PEGylated lipids were formulated. Subsequently, their transfection efficacy in vitro and in vivo was thoroughly evaluated. Meanwhile, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) technology, which labels intact nanoparticles, was utilized to monitor LNPs in vivo. Additionally, LNPs with different types of PEGylated lipids were assembled to assess their implications for transfection in vitro and in vivo.",

The launch of this drug marks the arrival of the era of nucleic acid nanomedicine.\n\nDuring development, Alnylam found that the functional activity of the LNP/RNA system is strongly correlated with pKa of ionizable lipids used. The pKa value of ionizable amino head of lipids is 6.2-6.5, which displayed an ideal balance between biocompatible neutral charge during circulation to maintain stability and enough positive charge at acidic pH to ensure high encapsulation efficiency on RNAs. Among the reported ionizable lipids, diolemethyl-4-dimethylaminobutyrate (DLin-MC3-DMA, Patent NO. US8158601B2)-based LNP is one of the most effective siRNA delivery systems. The application of DLin-MC3-DMA greatly reduces the dose of siRNA, and at the same time increases the gene silencing efficiency of siRNA in liver tissues.\n\nIn preparation of LNP, DLin-MC3-DMA is positively charged under the acidic condition (pH = 4), which can effectively encapsulate negatively charged siRNA. Subsequently, as the pH of solvent system is increased to physiological value (pH = 7.4), the LNP surface charge become near neutral. The introduction of cholesterol and 1,2-Distearoyl-  sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC) can further increase the stability of LNP [27]. Also, the introduction of PEGylated lipids can increase the storage stability by avoiding particle aggregation. Although the PEGylated nanoparticles can indirectly affect the interaction of LNP with cell surface, the PEG lipid (PEG-C14) containing short acyl chains used in Patisiran can gradually dissociate from the LNP [28,29] during blood circulation. After intravenous administration, Patisiran is adsorbed on endogenous Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) [29]; The removal of surface PEG layer can enhance the binding of ApoE to the surface of LNP.

Also, with LHRH peptide modification of nanoparticles, they found that the drug was mainly enriched in lung tumors [204]. \n\nCationic lipid-modified aminoglycoside (CLA) was explored to deliver mRNA to the liver. The results showed that a typical CLA named GT-EP10, delivering luciferase mRNA to mice at 0.05 mg/kg, achieved an average luminescence intensity of 10 7 in the liver [205]. Woitok et al. produced clinically functional LNP that contained the cationic amino-lipid KL52 using a T-junction. This LNP delivering c-Jun N-terminal kinase-2 (Jnk2) siRNA achieved efficient accumulation in the liver, and Jnk2 silencing ultimately reduced carcinogenesis in a model of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma [206]. Hattori et al. developed a novel method for siRNA transfer to the liver via intravenous injection of an anionic polymer and a cationic liposome/cholesterol-modified siRNA complex (cationic liposome). They found that siRNA accumulation shifted from the lungs to the liver when injected with poly L-glutamic acid (PGA) or chondroitin C (CS) sulfate [207].

To improve cellular uptake and the release of mRNA into the cytosol, encapsulation in synthetic particles of a variety of compositions has proven effective, and it additionally protects the mRNA from degradation by ribonucleases. Furthermore, these formulations can be decorated with ligands to provide the particles with the capacity to target specific cells upon systemic delivery. [17] rategies applied to the treatment of liver diseases, highlighting both their therapeutic efficacy as well as safety concerns. \n\nLNPs have been shown to very efficiently encapsulate RNA molecules and deliver them into the cellular cytoplasm. LNPs for mRNA delivery are typically comprised of four different lipids: an ionizable lipid, a neutral helper lipid, cholesterol, and a diffusible polyethylene glycol (PEG) lipid. For targeted delivery to hepatocytes, PEG lipid is essential for avoiding early capture by phagocytic cells, which is essential because liver resident macrophages, or Kupffer cells, have a great avidity for LNP-sized particles. 9] The first LNP prototypes for RNA delivery caused liver damage and elicited immune responses. [18] Thus, advances in LNPs as delivery vehicles have focused on identifying LNPs with improved endosomal escape, biodegradability, and safety and tolerability profiles. One of the most frequently used LNPs in the literature for the delivery of mRNA to liver parenchymal cells was developed by Moderna Therapeutics (referred to here as Mtx-LNPs) (Figure 1). 14] Mtx-LNPs are internalized into hepatocytes through a process mediated by an interaction between the LDL receptor and apolipoprotein E and other opsonins. In vivo studies have shown that the ionizable lipid is fully metabolized in the liver after 6 h, indicating that Mtx-LNPs are highly degradable and rapidly cleared from the liver.",

            "text": "[3] This achievement highlighted their remarkable potential as nanomedicines. It was only in 2018, when the Food and Drug Administration approved the first LNP-based therapeutic, namely Onpattro (Patisiran), introducing a novel approach to target hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis. [4] This approval set a critical step, catalyzing further research and development of LNP-based therapeutics. [5] [8][9] Ionizable lipids, which adopt a cationic charge in acidic conditions, are pivotal for the high-efficiency encapsulation of NAs through electrostatic interaction. [6,7] These lipids transition to neutral charge at physiological pH, enhancing biocompatibility by reducing toxicity and immunogenicity. Upon cellular uptake, LNPs are exposed to acidic endosomal environments, causing protonation of ionizable lipids. This protonation triggers interactions with the endosomal membrane, promoting endosomal escape (ES) and subsequent delivery of NAs into the cytosol. [7,10] [16][17] Together, this unique lipid composition enables LNPs to transport and deliver negatively charged, immunogenic, and membrane-impermeable NAs into cells and tissues. [18] [21] Despite the significant interest in LNP-based therapeutics, these systems face several challenges such as limited efficacy and potency and potential side-effects including toxicity and immunogenicity. [20,22,23] Moreover, LNPs primarily accumulate within the liver after intravenous administration, making it challenging to target extrahepatic tissues. [12,14,24,25] The efficacy of LNPs is significantly influenced by their cellular uptake and intercellular processing such as intracellular trafficking and ES. Studies suggest that \u224870% of endocytosed LNPs are subsequently recycled and exocytosed, with less than 2.5% successfully inducing ES . [20,23,26,27] ][30][31] This effort, however, comes with significant challenges due to the vast diversity of potential lipid combinations and the presence of over 40 000 unique lipid species.

            "text": "The liver is an important organ that participates in digestion, excretion, detoxification, and immunity. Liver diseases are clinically common and frequently occurring. Some liver diseases, such as viral hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer, greatly endanger hu-man health [90,91]. While many drugs are clinically used to treat liver diseases, most have limited clinical use owing to their poor distribution in the liver, significant toxic side-effects on other organs, and instability within the body. Consequently, there is an ongoing need to explore effective treatments for liver disease. Liver-targeted LNPs can effectively deliver drugs to lesion sites in the liver, reduce systemic distribution, decrease the dosage and frequency of medications, improve the therapeutic index of drugs, and reduce adverse reactions. \n\nThe success of patisiran (Onpattro \u00ae ) demonstrates the potential application of livertargeted LNPs in clinical treatment. This drug achieves efficient therapeutic effects by utilizing the natural uptake of LNPs by the liver and the expression of specific receptors on the surface of liver cells. During patisiran treatment, LNPs bind to apoE, which in turn binds to low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLRs). Given the high expression of LDLRs on the surface of liver cells, this binding mechanism enables LNPs to effectively deliver small interfering RNA (siRNA) to the liver, thereby silencing the expression of abnormal proteins associated with hereditary thyroxine transporter amyloidosis. The therapeutic strategy of using LNPs for liver-targeted delivery has shown significant advantages in treating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), liver fibrosis, and other liver diseases [92]. Xu et al. [60] explored the possibility of delivering epitope mRNA-LNPs by targeting hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), aimed at inhibiting allergic reactions to peanut crude protein extract. To achieve this goal, they developed mannose-modified LNPs that encapsulated mRNA-expressing peanut epitopes designed to enter the liver via biodistribution and be taken up by LSECs, which in turn induced a tolerance effect that effectively inhibited allergic reactions to crude peanut allergen extracts.",

However, it is generally observed that LNPs modified with PEG-lipids containing shorter fatty acid scaffolds (i.e. dimyristoyl scaffold; PEG-DMG) dominantly accumulate in the liver, when the particles are administrated via the tail vein since the shorter PEGlipids can easily dissociate from the particles in the blood circulation [6,14,15,16]. \n\nSince a longer blood retention is a crucial driving force for delivering LNP ssPalm to an inflammatory lesion, the LNP ssPalms used in the present study were modified with PEG-lipids that contain a longer chain fatty acid (distearoyl scaffold; PEG-DSG) that would allow the particles to be retained for longer periods of time in the blood. However, the use of PEG-DSG is attended by a dilemma: PEG modification has merit in avoiding hepatic clearance and prolonging the blood circulation time of the particles, while it, in parallel, prevents the cellular uptake and endosomal escape after the cellular entry via endocytosis. Thus, the density of the PEG and the type of PEGlipid need to be optimized so as to achieve to maximize and minimize the mRNA transfection activity in the target organ (colon) and non-target organ (liver), respectively [17,18]. The LNP ssPalms were modified with PEG 5000 -DSG at levels from 1.5 to 8.0 mol% of the total lipid and transgene expression in the colon was determined. \n\nThe physicochemical properties of these PEG-modified particles are shown in Table 2. As a result, a 3 mol% modification with PEG 5000 -DSG was found to be suitable for mRNA expression in the inflammatory colon. In the case of the LNP ssPalms used in this study, the amount of the PEG-lipids grafted onto the particles had no effect on the particle size, PdI or Zeta potential. The expression of luciferase was mainly detected in colon and spleen (Fig. 3d).",

            "text": "To better understand the reduced liver expression of (4S)-KEL12 LNP relative to SM-102 LNP, we compared the biodistribution of the two LNPs in the liver and spleen. (4S)-KEL12 and SM-102 LNPs, each encapsulating a uniquely barcoded mRNA, were administered into mice at an equal molar ratio via IV, followed by tissue dissection and next-generation sequencing (NGS) 4 hrs post-injection. (4S)-KEL12 LNP had significantly lower mRNA distribution in the liver and higher distribution in the spleen compared to SM-102 LNP (Figure 6D). Decreased liver distribution was consistent with the reduced hepatic expression of (4S)-KEL12 mRNA-LNP (Figure 4G,H), as well as the improved safety profile of (4S)-KEL12 LNP (Figure 5C,D). \n\nTo further characterize (4S)-KEL12 mRNA-LNP distribution in more detail, the levels of the (4S)-KEL12 lipid and mRNA were measured by LC-MS/MS and RT-qPCR, respectively, using mouse blood and organs harvested at different times following IM injection. The peak times for mRNA and ionizable lipid levels were observed at 2 hours in most tissues, with the spleen and injection site muscle peaking at or after 6 hours (Figure 6E-H). The higher lipid levels observed in the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes, which were sustained for up to 72 hours, suggested active uptake. Tissues and organs with active uptake also showed higher expression, as demonstrated by the strong luciferase fluorescence observed in the liver and spleen in the LNP expression experiment (Figure 4). In contrast, the levels of the (4S)-KEL12 ionizable lipid in the heart, lung, and kidney were consistently lower than in whole blood at all time points, suggesting that these organs received LNPs primarily through passive distribution via blood circulation rather than active uptake.",

[19], suggesting that this system may be applicable for treating atherosclerosis and the chronic inflammation found in cardiovascular disease. Lauschner et al. reported that lipidoid C12-200-LNPs containing siRNA targeting chemokine receptor CCR2 was localized in the spleen and bone marrow after systemic administration [49] and suppressed atherosclerotic plaque formation associated with mouse macrophages [188,189]. Sager et al. prepared LNPs composed of a lipid derivative of polyethyleneimine and an encapsulated siRNA cocktail against 5 adhesion molecules (Icam1, Icam2, Vcam1, Sele and Selp) [190]. Gene silencing of these adhesion molecules by the systemic administration of the LNPs significantly reduced vascular neutrophil and monocyte recruitment induced by myocardial infarction. Bifunctional core-shell NPs modified with hyaluronic acid and apolipoprotein A-I for targeting endothelial cell and macrophage, respectively, have been developed for the delivery of siRNA targeting Lectin-like, oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 (LOX-1) and atorvastatin [191].

With the development of mRNA-LNP modalities, which can incorporate xenobiotic constituents, extensive biodistribution analyses are necessary to better understand the factors that influence their in vivo exposure profiles.

After intravenous injection of Lipid 5-containing LNPs, 14C-containing Lipid 5 ([14C]Lipid 5) and radiolabeled metabolites ([14C]metabolites) were rapidly distributed, with peak concentrations reached within 1 hour in most tissues. After 10 hours, [14C]Lipid 5 and [14C]metabolites concentrated primarily in the urinary and digestive tracts. By 24 hours, [14C]Lipid 5 and [14C]metabolites were localized almost exclusively in the liver and intestines, with few or no concentrations detected in non-excretory systems, which is suggestive of hepatobiliary and renal clearance. [14C]Lipid 5 and [14C]metabolites were completely cleared within 168 hours (7 days). Biodistribution profiles were similar between QWBA and LC-MS/MS techniques, pigmented and nonpigmented rats, and male and female rats, excluding the reproductive organs. In conclusion, the rapid clearance through known excretory systems, with no evidence of redistribution for Lipid 5 or accumulation of [14C]metabolites, provides confidence for the safe and effective use of",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are one of the frequently used and well-established bioactive nanocarriers for anti-cancer treatment, which are featured as excellent abilities to encapsulate drugs, and prolong the half-life and release time of drugs. The therapeutic efficacy enhances with the prolongation of drugs targeting tumor cells. 28 It is reported that the cytotoxicity of gemcitabine-loaded LNPs in ARO cells is significantly higher than that of free drugs. Moreover, the ammonium sulfate in the inner compartment of liposomes induces the protonation of gemcitabine and reduces the reverse diffusion of drugs in liposomes, resulting in a 90% of encapsulation effect. 29 Compared with those of free drugs, drugs loaded in LNPs present less photodegradation and stronger anti-proliferative ability against three thyroid cancer cell lines PTC1, B-CPAP and FRO. 30 LNPs are biocompatible and they can be functionalized with a variety of molecules and mRNAs. For example, a 4-fold higher accumulation of the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)-conjugated polymer-lipid hybrid nanoparticles is detected in FTC 133 xenografts than that of the non-targeted nanoparticles, and the former presents a stronger anti-cancer role against thyroid cancer. 31 Li et al 32 developed liposome-peptide-mRNA nanoparticles (LPm NP) that are composed of mRNAs, peptide core and cationic lipid core-shell nanostructures. The optimal transfection rate and delivery effect can be obtained by adjusting the nitrogen/phosphorus (N/P) ratio in the core complex and mRNA adsorption, thus increasing the proportion of cells with positively expressed sodium iodide symporter (NIS) in the ATC cell line 8505C. 32 Liposomal delivery of miR-34b-5p significantly inhibits the proliferation, migration and angiogenesis in ATC cell lines 8505C and BHT-101, which also significantly suppresses the growth of BHT-101 xenografts in nude mice. 33",

Four distinct lipid mixes (LMs) were formulated by modifying various components: LM1 (ALC-0315/DSPC/Cholesterol/ALC-0159), LM2 (ALC-0315/DOPE/Cholesterol/ALC-0159), LM3 (ALC-0315/DSPC/Cholesterol/DMG-PEG2k), and LM4 (DLin-MC3-DMA/DSPC/Cholesterol/ALC-0159). LNPs exhibited stability and homogeneity with a mean size of 75 to 90 nm, confirmed by cryo-TEM and SAXS studies. High mRNA encapsulation (95\u2013100%) was achieved. LNPs effectively delivered EGFP-encoding mRNA to HepG2 and DC2.4 cell lines. LNPs induced cytokine secretion from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), revealing that LM1, LM2, and LM4 induced 1.5- to 4-fold increases in IL-8, TNF-\u03b1, and MCP-1 levels, while LM3 showed minimal changes. Reporter mRNA expression was observed in LNP-treated PBMCs. Hemotoxicity studies confirmed formulation biocompatibility with values below 2%. In vivo biodistribution in mice post intramuscular injection showed significant mRNA expression, mainly in the liver. The modification of LNP components influenced reactogenicity, inflammatory response, and mRNA expression, offering a promising platform for selecting less reactogenic carriers suitable for repetitive dosing in metabolic disease treatment.",

            "text": "LIPID NANOPARTICLES FOR MRNA DELIVERY Due to their size, polyanionic nature, and hydrophilicity, the intracellular delivery of mRNA molecules cannot generally rely on passive diffusion across cell membranes. Furthermore, nucleic acids are rapidly degraded by endogenous nucleases in physiological fluids. To overcome these challenges, LNPs incorporating ionizable lipids have been developed as delivery vehicles for siRNA and mRNA, serving both to protect the delicate cargo from degradation in vivo and to enable delivery into the cell. LNPs for mRNA delivery generally comprise a zwitterionic phospholipid, cholesterol, a polyethylene glycol (PEG) lipid, and an ionizable lipid. 45,46 Engineering the lipid structure 47 and particle surface has thus been pursued as a strategy to enhance cellular uptake and endosomal escape 48,49 while specific nanostructural features of the LNP, such as nonlamellar lipid phases, have also been suggested to affect delivery efficiency. 50 LNP interfacial interactions with the cell membrane initiate the internalization of the mRNA; then, inside the cell, the more acidic environment protonates the ionizable lipid, reversing the electrostatic interactions to release the RNA cargo for translation and subsequent protein expression. This is of course an oversimplified description, and the reader is directed to some excellent recent reviews that address these intracellular aspects in more detail. 45,51 The LNP morphology, lipid packing, and microenvironment of the encapsulated mRNA are thus plausibly connected to the delivery efficiency, emphasizing the central significance of higher-order structure associated with both the mRNA and LNP. \n\nThe challenges of LNP preparative scale-up and large-scale processing represent another interesting point of distinction between mRNA-vaccines and biologic drugs. While LNPs may be prepared at bench-scale using pipets and simple manual mixing, 52 their cGMP scale-up for clinical/commercial use employs finely controllable rapid-mixing platforms involving multiple processing steps. 53,54 In contrast, the large-scale production of many biologic drugs can be based on relatively simple thaw\u2212filter\u2212fill drug product production processes.",

            "text": "Hepatic fibrosis is a manifestation of chronic damage to the liver. Despite it being one of the most characterised pathologies, an effective therapeutic strategy remains elusive. This study investigated the macro and micro protective effects of blocking HA production using 4MU and siHAS2-LNP. We compared liver transcriptomic signatures resulting from both approaches to elucidate common and unique biological pathways that could be responsible for 4MU hepatoprotective activity. Despite some nonspecific effects of siLuc-LNP, our analysis revealed specific effects of siHAS2-LNP and identified several critical pathways common to both 4MU and siHAS2-LNP treatment. \n\nThe interference of cationic lipid nanoparticles (LNP) with inflammatory responses has been observed in several studies. This phenomenon has been previously reported, wherein cationic LNP of the same composition as those used in this study can amplify pre-existing inflammation. The authors demonstrated that injection of nonimmunogenic RNA formulated in LNP (modmRNA-LNP) potentiated existing LPS-induced inflammation in mice as observed by higher induction of IL-6 and macrophage inflammatory protein 2 (Mip-2) in serum from LPS-treated mice injected with modmRNA-LNP compared to mice treated with LPS only. This effect was specific to the LNP, acting independent of mRNA cargo, a phenomenon the authors termed inflammation exacerbation (IE). It was further established that the IE phenomenon is a reaction to LNP, not to modmRNA, as empty LNP led to the same inflammation potentiation effect and cytokine surge 76 . IE phenomenon was associated with proinflammatory cytokine surge, mainly Mcp-1, also known as Ccl2 (a potent inducer of migration and activation of Natural killer cells, NK) 77 . \n\nWe postulate that the IE phenomenon explains the antifibrotic effects of siLuc-LNP. Recent publications provide strong support for our hypothesis. NK cells have been shown to suppress HSC differentiation and induce apoptosis. NK cells constitute a significant portion of human circulating lymphocytes, accounting for approximately 5-15%.",

Regarding Patisiran, a study on rats using 14 C-labeled ionizable lipid ( 14 C-MC3) had revealed that with a single intravenous dose of siRNA-LNP, approximately 90% of the administered radioactivity was detected in the liver 4 h after administration [21]. Regarding Tozinameran, a study on rats using 3 H-labeled cholesteryl hexadecyl ether ( 3 H-CHE) had revealed that with a single intramuscular dose of mRNA-LNP (luciferase mRNA as surrogate), radioactivity concentration was the highest at the injection site between 15 min and 48 h (i.e. the entire measurement period) after administration [22]. Besides that in the administration site, the total radioactivity recovery rate for the dose was highest in the liver (up to 18%) 8e48 h after administration [22]. Subcutaneously administered liposomes Fig. 2. Delivery mechanism of lipid nanoparticles. First, full encapsulation by lipid nanoparticles (LNP) protects RNA from nuclease digestion. LNPs are neutral in physiological pH due to the ionizable lipid and PEG-lipid, thereby reducing non-specific interactions with serum proteins. Second, following dissociation of the PEG-lipid, cells take up LNPs via apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-dependent and/or ApoE-independent pathways. Finally, protonated LNPs, upon acidification in the endosome, induce hexagonal phase structures, disrupt the membranes, and release RNA molecules into the cytoplasm. Fig. 3.

            "text": "Kupffer cells, as macrophages in the liver, play a key role in immune monitoring and the inflammatory response of the liver. They are mainly responsible for removing particles and pathogens from the blood through phagocytosis [58]. To enhance the uptake of LNPs by Kupffer cells and their immunoregulation ability, research has explored various strategies, including increasing the size of LNPs and modifying the LNP surface with hydrophobic molecules [59]. Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) are located in the sinusoidal space of the liver, where they play important roles in blood filtration, metabolic regulation, antigen presentation, and lipid metabolism. LSECs have a unique structure and function, enabling them to play a crucial role in immune and metabolic processes in the liver [60]. Targeting LNPs to Kupffer cells and LSECs can lead to more effective drug or gene delivery, especially in the treatment of liver diseases. For example, in diseases that require liver-specific treatment, such as hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and liver cancer, this targeted delivery strategy can improve the therapeutic outcomes and reduce unnecessary side-effects. Paunovska et al. [61] explored the use of different types of cholesterol to modify LNPs and reported that the structure of the cholesterol significantly affects the targeting ability of the LNPs. In addition, by using the Fast Identification Nanoparticle Delivery (FIND) system, they screened LNPs formulated with different oxidized cholesterol and observed that LNPs containing oxidized cholesterol can efficiently deliver mRNA to cells in the liver microenvironment, including Kupffer cells and liver endothelial cells. This contrasts with conventional LNPs, which primarily target hepatocytes, and suggests that the targeting of LNPs to specific cell types can be improved by specific chemical modifications. This improved targeting has significant implications for the treatment of liver diseases and the application of immunotherapy.",

            "text": "Systemically delivered LNPs carrying mRNA face multiple barriers to delivery (Figure 1). The mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS), especially in the liver and spleen, is a frequent destination for injected nanoparticles, owing to its native role in policing the body for nano-sized infectious agents. 86 The kidney filters off naked mRNA or any nanoparticle with hydrodynamic diameter less than 5.5 nm. 87 Most of the LNPs are about 100 nm in diameter and large enough to prevent them from escaping the MPS and reaching other organs of interest. 88 The liver, which forms a major part of the MPS, has a fenestrated vasculature and contains phagocytic cells such as Kupffer cells, which retain cationic LNPs. Furthermore, large cationic LNPs fail to extravasate from the capillaries found in the lungs and cannot be filtered from the bloodstream by the kidney. 86 his can lead to the accumulation of delivery materials in the liver, lungs, or other organs. 89 Therefore, the clearance and biodegradability of the delivery system components is one consideration when developing mRNA delivery materials. \n\nEster groups are the most commonly used functional group for enhancing the biodegradability of biomaterials, but the in vivo degradation of different ester bonds can depend on the overall chemistry of the molecules and formulations. 90 For example, both LP-01 and lipid 5 (discussed earlier) are reported to clear from the liver rapidly (halflife [t 1/2 ] 6 h), compared to DLin-MC3-DMA (t 1/2 > 50 h), with comparable if not more protein expression. In certain tissues, the presence of ester functionality may accelerate the degradation of LNPs, potentially even limiting protein expression. For example, OF-Deg-Lin induced protein expression selectively in the spleen, even though it was able to reach the liver cells. 46 It was hypothesized that this may be due to the rapid degradation of the LNPs by liver enzymes. Rational design of degradable lipids or polymers based on polyesters or polycarbonates 91 could offer better control over the degradation of the delivery systems.",

            "text": "The release of nucleic acids bound to cationic lipids following LNPs entry into cells is a critical step in effective nucleic acid delivery (Figure 3b). To improve delivery efficiency, extensive research has focused on the chemical optimization of cationic lipids in LNPs [76]. These cationic lipids contain ionizable amine structures with variable charges. At low pH, the amine groups acquire a positive charge, enabling binding to negatively charged cargo while maintaining a neutral state at physiological pH to reduce toxicity. Upon endosomal acidification during cellular uptake, the amine structures regain their positive charge, facilitating cargo release. Negatively charged lipids within the cell further promote nucleic acid release by neutralizing the charge of the cationic lipid carriers and disrupting electrostatic interactions. This mechanism allows LNPs to deliver nucleic acid drugs with highly stability and efficiency in vivo, enhancing intracellular delivery [77]. Beyond amine structures, the hydrophobic lipid tails and linkers in LNPs can also be chemically modified to design new lipid-based nanocarriers. Incorporating of biodegradable linkers, branched chains, and functional groups enhances the biocompatibility, efficacy, and targeting capabilities of lipid-based carriers [78]. \n\nresulting in over 67% inhibition of tumor growth [79]. \n\nA critical advantage of LNPs is their ability to target tissues with high precision. This capability is primarily achieved by modulating lipid composition, significantly reducing the off-target effects associated with non-specific delivery methods. LNPs demonstrate particularly high accumulation efficiency in the liver, making them suitable for treating liver diseases. The efficiency, scalability, and potential for single-administration treatments position LNP-based delivery systems as promoting candidates for clinical applications [80]. Intellia Therapeutics initiated the first clinical trial using LNPs as a delivery vector for CRISPR-Cas9, targeting hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis with polyneuropathy (ATTRv-PN) in NTLA-2001 therapy. This therapy aims to edit the TTR gene in hepatocytes.",

Table 2 summarizes the mRNA-loaded LNPs produced by microfluidic devices [3,35,[81][82][83][84][85][86][87][88][89][90][91][92][93][94][95][96][97][98][99]. Kauffman et al. [81] reported an optimization strategy for lipid formulation using a microfluidic device. They optimized the types of lipids, molar ratio of the lipids, and N/P ratio for mRNA delivery to the liver in vivo, which resulted in a 3-fold improvement in the delivery and expression of luciferase mRNA (1653 nucleotides) relative to the original formulation (Fig. 8). For a shorter mRNA (583 nucleotides) encoding erythropoietin (EPO), the optimized LNP formulation showed 7-fold higher EPO expression in the liver relative to that of the original LNP formulation. Interestingly, the FVII-silencing activities of the original and optimized formulations for siRNA-loaded LNPs were the same. The results demonstrated the combined use of microfluidics and design-of-experiment (DoE) approaches for optimizing the LNP formulation. Additionally, Sato et al. [35] reported a two-step DoE approach for preparing liver-targeted mRNA-loaded LNPs using original pH-sensitive cationic lipids (CL4H6 and CL15H6) and the iLiNP device. They optimized several formulation parameters, including the mRNA/lipid ratio, cationic lipid concentration, phospholipid concentration, and molar ratios of lipids, to design mRNA-loaded LNP libraries based on previously reported siRNA-loaded LNPs and DoEs. The results identified LNP size and the PEG-DMG/phospholipid ratio as critical factors, which was similar to other lipid formulations, and that the optimized mRNA",

Synthesis by using unsaturated thiols showed improved transfection efficiency by 18-fold in vitro, and also a huge amount targeting the liver. 88 Unsaturation, like by Miao et al. helps target the liver more efficiently. Vitelline vein injection of the LNPs by Riley et al. targets fetal liver. 72 The targeted organ is decided by the structure of the polyamine-lipid core and the length of lipid epoxide, which are important for gene liver delivery. 72 NPs targeting other organs such as the spleen or lung are of value. Fenton et al. chemically synthesized new cationic lipids using EDC coupling and they succeeded in formulating lipid nanoparticles. 67 OF-Deg-Lin is the cationic lipid Fenton et al. synthesized. Because OF-Deg-Lin has improved electrophilicity and ester linkages in OF-Deg-Lin generate a nontoxic fatty acid, it is targeted to B lymphocytes of spleens. 67 Of-Deg-Lin mRNA LNPs are also delivered to the liver but protein translation does not proceed in liver cells. 67 This implies that mRNA with OF-Deg-Lin survives the enzymatic conditions in the spleen, but not in the liver. 67 The spleen is mainly composed of B cells and T cells. 131 Targeting T cells in the spleen is as valuable as targeting B cells. Lokugamage et al. synthesized a constrained adamantane cationic lipid, forming an armchair structure, which is able to deliver siRNA to T cells in vivo. 68 It is successfully targeted to T cells via natural trafficking, meaning an alternative to active targeting. 68 Li et al. developed a new lipid nanoparticle platform for COVID-19. TB-UC18 which targets the spleen showed that saturation and length of the lipid tail affect transfection efficiency, meaning that the more unsaturated and longer the lipid tail is, the higher the expression in the spleen. On the other hand, lipid nanoparticles could deliver genes to the lung efficiently.",

            "text": "The neutral exterior lipidnanoparticle greatly prolonged its lifetime in vivo with reduced toxicity. \n\nIn addition, cholesterol and 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3phosphocholine (DSPC) was introduced to form LNP complex with ionizable cationic lipids, which further strengthened the stability of LNP 56 . To avoid non-specific tissue uptake of LNP during circulation, polyethylene glycol (PEG)-lipids were usually modified on the surface of LNP complex. The PEG lipids will gradually dissociate during blood circulation, i.e., shedding from the LNP, which mitigate its negative effects to the interaction between LNP and membrane of targeting cells 57 . In the liver targeted LNP-based drug, like Patisiran (the first siRNA-loaded LNP therapeutic being approved by FDA in 2018) 58 , the removal of PEG lipid enhanced LNP absorption on endogenous Apolipoprotein E (ApoE). LNPs accumulated in the liver along the blood circulation are taken up by hepatocytes, which are mediated by ApoE receptors on the hepatocytes surface. After its endocytosis by targeting cells, the pH changes in vesicles leads to the release of nucleotides 59 . \n\nBased on this mechanism, some lncRNAs targeting siRNA delivered by LNP were also developed since the clinical success of Patisiran. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), Connorty et al. 60 identified lncRNA LINC01257 as having an oncogenic role by promoting the proliferation of leukemia. By mixing siRNA with a lipid mixture (D-Lin-MC3, DSPC, cholesterol, DMG-PEG, DOPE-Rho), they targeted LINC01257 in AML cells by NxGen microfluidics systems (Fig. 6). The si-LINC01257-LNP effectively inhibits the proliferation of AML cells and reduces the off-target effects to the peripheral blood mononuclear cells.",

            "text": "LNPs are amphiphilic systems composed of various hydrophobic and hydrophilic components, such as cationic or ionized lipids, neutral lipids such as phospholipids or cholesterol, and polyethylene glycol-lipids. LNPs are structurally different from liposomes because LNPs have no continuous lipid bilayer or large internal pool [143]. LNPs were developed as carriers to deliver a variety of molecules to cells, especially with unique advantages in nucleic acid delivery. Because nucleic acids are extremely unstable outside the cell and carry a large amount of anions, they cannot easily pass through the cell membrane. However, encapsulation in cationic liposomes allows easy delivery of nucleic acids into cells. Compared with traditional drug therapy, LNPs have unique advantages including preventing drug degradation, enabling targeted drug delivery, and reducing drug toxicity, which has generated high interest in LNPs for delivery of anti-cancer drugs [144]. Pre-clinical trials show that LNPs can successfully deliver siRNA or mRNA [145,146], so LNPs seem to be a safe and effective delivery tool. \n\nIn the past few years, many preclinical studies of CRISPR/Cas9 delivery leveraged LNPs. Two main methods are used for LNP delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 components: delivery of Cas9 and sgRNA plasmid DNA or mRNA, or delivery of Cas9: sgRNA RNP complex. Cas9 mRNA and sgRNA can be efficiently loaded on LNPs and accurately transported to the liver of mice, effectively mediating mouse transthyretin (Ttr) gene editing [147]. Despite some progress, predicting and rationally designing LNPs for delivery to target tissues other than the liver for precise gene editing remains a problem. In 2020, Cheng et al. created a strategy called selective organ targeting (SORT) by adding supplementary components on the basis of traditional LNPs, precisely changing the profile of RNA delivery in the body and mediating tissuespecific gene editing [148]. SORT allows nanoparticles to deliver gene editing systems to specific organs, which is expected to promote further development of gene correction therapies.",

            "text": "In the recent past, one approach, and also the most common one, has been the use of lipid library screening, which allows for the identification of structurally analogous targeting lipid candidates or the discovery of new structure-activity relationships. For example, a platform for mRNA delivery to activated hepatic stellate cells (aHSCs) was reported, from which a promising lipid candidate CL15A6 with high affinity to aHSCs was identified, and the biosafety with an in vivo dose up to 2 mg/kg was proven. 37 In addition, Frederick Campbell and colleagues rationally designed an anionic LNP that switched neutral LNPs surface charge into anionic based on the formulation of Onpattro, 38 which preferentially targeted mRNA delivery to the hepatic reticuloendothelial system (RES) made up of LSECs and KCs through scavenger receptors stabilin-1 and -2 mediating anionic recognition of LNPs with LSECs. 39 elective targeting of liver cells by using ligand-modified LNPs is another potential strategy. Mannose-modified LNPs can achieve selective delivery of nucleic acids to LSECs through the mannose receptor, which is specifically expressed on LSECs. 30,40 This strategy was employed by Andre E. Nel and his team, where they used mannose-modified DSPE-PEG 2000 as the PEGylated lipid moiety of LNPs (Figure 1A), enabling LSEC-specific delivery of GFP mRNA at the cellular level (Figure 1B), and also enhancing in vivo lung gathering of man-LNPs with the dose of 1 mg/kg (Figure 1C). 41 onventional LNPs mostly enrich the liver due to natural characteristics, making it difficult and necessary to target extra-hepatic tissue. Inspired by the four-component formula of classical LNPs, the selective organ-targeting (SORT) strategy, first reported by Daniel J. Siegwart's group, has been reported, which involves the incorporation of a complementary component, known as the SORT molecule, in classical fourcomposition LNPs (Figure 1D). 42",

            "text": "PEGylation involves the attachment of polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains to molecules, such as drugs, proteins, or nanoparticles to improve systemic circulation time and reduce immunogenicity. PEG-lipids create a 'stealth' effect by shielding the surface of nanoparticles to limit the adsorption of serum proteins onto the nanoparticle's surface and minimize their recognition by the immune system (Hossian et al., 2019;Labatut and Mattheolabakis, 2018;Mattheolabakis et al., 2014;Suk et al., 2016). The steric hindrance introduced by the brush-like PEG molecules from the surface of the nanoparticles can result in prolonged residence time in the circulation of the nanoparticles, and potential accumulation to specific tissues, such as tumors, due to the enhanced permeation and retention effect (EPR) (Lahooti et al., 2023). Similar to other lipids, PEG-lipids have a hydrophobic portion that is usually made of alkyl chains, which is integrated into the lipid layer, and a hydrophilic part that also contains the PEG, which extends from the surface of the LNPs. While PEGylation enhances circulation time and reduces immune recognition of nanoparticles, excessive PEGylation might hinder the efficient interaction of LNPs with target cells, leading to reduced therapeutic effects (Kumar et al., 2014), and fusion of the LNPs with the endosomal membrane due to steric hindrance, leading to therapeutic inefficacy (Aldosari et al., 2021;Kulkarni et al., 2019). More importantly, the PEG-lipids significantly impact LNP formulation and size (Kulkarni et al., 2019;Samaridou et al., 2020). In two studies by Belliveau et al. and Ryals et al., particle size decreases upon PEG lipid content increase in the formulations (Belliveau et al., 2012;Ryals et al., 2020).",

            "text": "The use of short lipids-PEG able to quickly dissociate is therefore one of the preferred options to target the liver [34]. In vivo, it was then proved that nanoparticles with DMG-PEG anchor have no prolonged circulation time compared with the same particles grafted with C18-PEG, while the latter demonstrated higher stability in serum and tumor accumulation [33,35]. More recently, DMG-PEG 2000 was used in the COVID-19 Spikevax \u00ae vaccine [36], considering that an extended residence time could lead to undesirable inflammation at the injection site [37], and because, despite the lack of information, opsonization of the LNPs could also help to stimulate the immune system by promoting uptake by innate immune cells [38]. The formation of a protein corona around LNPs can therefore be seen either as a limitation or as an opportunity, depending on the application. In this context, the developed NTA method could be used to quickly screen new LNPs formulations and facilitate the rapid translation from in vitro to clinic. Its ease of implementation (low required volumes and materials) and its benefits over traditional methods to separate LNPs bound to proteins from free proteins make of this method an interesting tool. Indeed, separation methods no longer reflect the practical in vivo dynamic equilibrium between the adsorption and desorption of proteins, or the establishment of a soft corona around the high affinity proteins directly grafted around LNPs forming the hard corona [2]. \n\nThe impact of these lipids-PEG and of ionizable lipids on cellular metabolic activity was studied in tumor HeLa and HepG2 cells. In serum-free medium, LNPs induced low or no toxicity. In contrast, when used in the presence of serum, a significant impact of SM-102 LNPs with Cer-, DMG-and DTA-PEG on the metabolic activity of cells was noticed, predominantly in HepG2 cells. Considering the previously mentioned rapid desorption of C14 lipid-PEG in serum, it could be hypothesized that the transfection of cells with SM-102 LNPs lacking PEG could disturb cell metabolic activity.",

            "text": "We conducted a biodistribution study of siAR-LNPs in athymic nude mice subcutaneously engrafted with PC346C tumors. Since this previous study with siAR-LNPs (Quick et al., 2022) demonstrated that most of the dose was still cleared by liver and spleen, we additionally investigated whether pre-treatment with liposomes or dextran sulfate could enhance LNP accumulation in the tumor. For this experiment, we prepared and characterized siAR-LNPs labeled with a Cy5.5 fluorescent lipid (Table S1) and validated that the LNPs and liposomes we used were stable at 4 \u2022 C over the course of 60 days (Fig. S2). The experimental plan to quantitatively assess the pharmacokinetic characteristics and biodistribution of siAR-LNPs with and without pre-treatment of liposomes or dextran sulfate is shown in Fig. 2a. As we aimed to combine the RES blockade strategy with the nanoparticle dose threshold for tumor delivery (Ouyang et al., 2020), we determined by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) that the liposome treated animals were intravenously injected with ~1.2 \u00d7 10 14 liposomal particles, approximately two orders of magnitude above the suggested 10 12 particles threshold for enhanced tumor accumulation (Ouyang et al., 2020). \n\nWe first determined the effect of liposomes and dextran sulfate pretreatment on the circulation time of PEG-DSG LNPs by measuring the Cy5.5 fluorescent signal in serum at multiple time points after injection. The percentage of the LNP dose (% ID) remaining in circulation after 4 h was similar for the liposome group compared to the control, but significantly lower for the dextran sulfate group (Fig. 2b). When comparing the areas under the curve (AUC) of LNP-serum detection for the different treatments over the course of 4 h, the calculated AUCs were 375.7 (A.U.) for the control group, 333.7 (A.U) for the liposome and 175.3 (A.U.) for the dextran sulfate group.",

We compared polymers with a 4C side chain (AA2-DL-3), which exerted selectivity to the lungs and spleen, and the long (C9) side chain (AA2-TD-3), which showed more mRNA delivery to the liver (Figure 5B). The measurement of DiR fluorescence showed that, in both cases, the majority of APE-LNPs accumulated in the liver (\u00b175%) with lower distribution to the spleen (10\u221215%) and lungs (5\u221210%) (Figures 5D and  S14A,B). Our biodistribution data indicate that there is no direct correlation between APE-LNP uptake by certain tissues and functional mRNA delivery. However, these results corroborate other findings with lipid and polymeric nanoparticles, where organs with the highest accumulation did not exhibit the highest mRNA expression. 7,25,53 We speculate that organ selectivity may relate to alterations in the formation of the protein corona resulting from the alkyl side chain's impact on the chemical composition and physicochemical properties of APE-LNPs, but detailed mechanistic studies are required to confirm this hypothesis. 55,56 Further studies are needed to determine the likely complex mechanism behind this in vivo behavior of both lipid and polymer delivery systems. \n\nThe apparent acid dissociation constant (pK a ) of LNPs containing ionizable lipids was shown to affect mRNA delivery to different organs. 11 We therefore studied the impact of the APE alkyl side chain composition on the pK a of APE-LNPs using 2-(p-toluidino)naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid (TNS) assay. 57 The apparent pK a of APE-LNPs ranged from 3 to 6 and was not significantly affected by the length of the polymer side chain (Tables 1, S2, and Figure S9A,B), but rather mainly driven by the composition of the tertiary amino-alcohol.",

            "text": "In the field of gene editing, the application of nanoparticles has opened new avenues for precise interventions in complex biological systems. These tiny engineered materials can effectively encapsulate and protect gene editing tools, enabling their safe delivery to target  (Jeong et al., 2023). These components collectively enable LNPs to effectively transport biologically active substances like nucleic acids and proteins into cells. The intracellular delivery efficiency of LNPs can be finely tuned through rational design and modification, by altering aspects such as lipid composition, particle size, and surface characteristics (Paunovska et al., 2022;Wang et al., 2023b). The key advantages of LNPs include their extremely small particle size, high stability, and biocompatibility, which enable effective drug protection and delivery efficiency. One of the characteristics of conventional LNPs is their resemblance to low-density lipoprotein (LDL), which leads to their recognition and uptake by LDL receptors predominantly present in liver cells (Raguram et al., 2022). This results in the accumulation of LNPs in the liver, posing a limitation for their use in targeting non-hepatic tissues or organs. To overcome this challenge and expand the utility of LNPs beyond hepatic applications, researchers have been developing various innovative strategies. One such approach involves localized LNP injections, where Palanki and colleagues have successfully identified the most effective LNPs in the perinatal mouse brain by administering intracerebroventricular (ICV) injections in fetal and neonatal mice (Palanki et al., 2023). Another strategy is the use of DNA barcoding to identify non-hepatic cell-tropic LNPs (Dahlman et al., 2017;Ni et al., 2022). This method leverages unique DNA barcodes to modify distinct LNPs, resulting in a highly selective and efficient nanodelivery system targeted towards specific cells or tissues. Targeted modification of LNPs to achieve redirection is also a promising approach.",

            "text": "Delivery systems for siRNAs into target cells constitute crucial elements in designing an effective treatment strategy. Non-viral vectors, encompassing polymers, aptamers, peptides, liposomes, antibodies, and lipid nanoparticles, play a pivotal role [29]. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) with a core-shell structure, comprising cholesterol, phospholipids, and cationic ionizable lipids in the outer shell and cationic ionizable lipids, cholesterol, and RNA in the inner core, present a versatile delivery system [30]. LNPs exhibit advantageous ionizable behavior, enhancing endosomal escape, displaying self-assembly, and reducing toxicity [29]. For treating chronic hepatitis B, incorporating hepatocyte-targeting compounds such as galactopyranoside cholesterol and PEG can enhance stability in the blood. Ensuring uniform LNP size is essential to prevent sequestration during circulation, and modifications to avoid endosomal entrapment can improve their delivery efficiency [29]. \n\nIn a study utilizing a nontoxic lipid-based vector system to deliver PEGylated siRNA to the liver showed that this approach significantly reduced HBV replication in vivo. Systemic administration of these nanoparticles to mice with HBV resulted in a notable suppression of HBV replication markers, achieving up to a threefold reduction over 28 days [31]. Guanidino-propyl-modified siRNAs in anionic polymer-containing lipoplexes demonstrated efficient delivery to the liver, effectively inhibiting viral replication [32]. \n\nAnother lipid-based delivery system strategy is stable nucleic acid lipid particles (SNALPs). In a 2005 study evaluating the efficacy of siRNA delivered via SNALP to mice with HBV, this vector exhibited improved efficacy and a longer half-life in plasma and the liver, reducing HBV DNA levels in the serum for up to 6 weeks [33]. \n\nThe conjugation of siRNAs to N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc/NAc) has gained prominence for liver-targeting therapy.",

Highly accumulated lipids in the liver induce hepatic ballooning and apoptosis, and cytokines have been known to be the main triggers for hepatic macrophages to induce inflammation and activation of stellate cells causing fibrosis in the liver. [47,49] Consequently, the reduction of lipids and inflammatory cytokines accumulated in the fatty liver is a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment and prevention of NASH. \n\nTo study the biodistribution of PBP-NPs in a NASH model, Cy5.5-loaded PBP-NPs were intravenously injected into the mouse fed a high-fat/high-fructose diet (HFHFD) for 28 weeks. Biodistribution kinetics with Cy5.5-loaded PBP-PLGA NPs in the NASH model was different from the high-fat diet-induced type 2 diabetic mouse model (Figure 4a and Figure 6a). High localization of PBP-NPs was observed in vWAT as well as the T2DM model until 24 h (Figure 6a and Figure S10, Supporting Information). However, PBP-NPs were also highly distributed in the fatty liver of the NASH model than what was observed in the liver of the T2DM model (Figure 6a and Figure S10, Supporting Information). The high signal was also obtained in the cryosection of fatty liver tissue (Figure 6b and Figure S11, Supporting Information). Also, liver tissues isolated from a high-fat diet-induced type 2 diabetic mouse model after injecting free dye and various Cy5.5loaded nanoparticles were analyzed using flow cytometry.

On the other hand, cationic mRNA lipoplexes prepared from cationic lipid and cholesterol, for the delivery of nucleoside-modified mRNA and monophosphoryl lipid A (a TLR4 agonist), were found to accumulate primarily in the lungs transfecting their dendritic cells [112]. Unexpectedly, Kranz et al. [50] found that reducing the lipid content of mRNA lipoplexes imparted a negative charge to the nanoparticles and shifted their accumulation from the lungs to the spleen. Clinical investigation (phase I) of targeting anionic mRNA lipoplexes demonstrated accumulation of the nucleic acid in the spleen of melanoma patients [113].",

Patisiran formulations target liver hepatocytes, which is the primary site for the synthesis of TTR protein. Post IV infusion of Patisiran in 29 patients, there was a 20-30% reduction in TTR protein levels 24 h after the first dose, followed by an 85% reduction after the second dose, and maximum knockdown of 96% of TTR was observed after the third dose at 0.3 mg/kg [52]. \n\nIn another promising finding, LNPs have been shown to co-deliver both mRNA and siRNA with optimal efficacy, wherein the other RNA acts as a helper. The LNP formulation consisted of a molar ratio of ionizable lipid:DSPC:DOPE:CHO:C14-PEG2000 (38.8:3.6:10.9:44.5:2.25) with a lipid to RNA weight ratio of 8.75:1. siRNA targeting Factor VII gene and mRNA for luciferase protein were encapsulated in LNPs. siRNA silencing was increased twofold, whereas luciferase expression due to mRNA delivery increased three times following tail vein injection in mice. The substitution of either RNA by a negatively charged polymer (polystyrene sulfonate) as a helper RNA did not affect the efficacy [53]. \n\nLNPs must show a superior pharmacokinetic profile with reduced toxicity. Therefore, the careful selection of ionizable lipids is critical for the success of LNP formulations. This led to the development of biodegradable LNPs, which show good hepatic clearance along with functionality to achieve superior efficacy.",

            "text": "The liver is the primary organ of LNP accumulation following intravenous admin istration and is also observed to varying degrees following intramuscular and subcutane ous routes, with larger LNP having less liver uptake [26]. For example, after intramuscular administration of an mRNA LNP vaccine to mice, branched DNA analysis of tissue mRNA identified muscle > lymph node > liver > spleen > testis as the primary organs o LNP accumulation in descending order [27]. Interestingly, mRNA LNP uptake does no necessarily correlate with mRNA protein expression [26]. The cell populations involved in liver uptake are dependent upon the underlying uptake mechanism. A common mech anism of uptake for most nanoparticles, including LNP, is scavenger receptor-mediated uptake into the hepatic Kupffer cells and sinusoidal endothelium following opsonization by non-specific absorption of plasma proteins [28]. Alternatively, Akinc et al. discovered that adsorption of endogenous apolipoprotein E (ApoE) can direct the uptake of LNP to hepatocytes through interaction with the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) located in these cells [29]. These researchers characterized this uptake mechanism by using LDLR knockout mice and hepatocytes in vitro and went on to show that the N-acetylgalactosa mine (GalNAc) ligand covalently attached to LNP could also target hepatocytes through the asialoglycoprotein receptor (Table 1). The utility of GalNAc-mediated hepatocyte tar geting of LNP is demonstrated by the recent approval of Onpattro transthyretin siRNA for hereditary amyloidosis mentioned above. Clearly, delivery of nucleic acid to hepato cytes by LNP has therapeutic potential, but there are many disease indications that would benefit from non-hepatic LNP tissue and cell population targeting, such as cancer and neurological and cardiovascular disease.",

[103] developed a general strategy to optimize LNP formulations by varying the molar ratio of lipids and the nitrogen-to-phosphorus ratio by incorporating DOPE and increasing the weight ratio of ionizable lipids to mRNA via microfluidics and the DoE method. Relative to the original formulation, the optimized LNP formulation showed a 7-fold higher EPO expression in the liver compared to the original LNP formulation, which indicated that this optimization strategy approach can accelerate the screening in vivo and optimization of nanoparticle formulations with a large multi-dimensional design space. Interestingly, the optimized LNP did not improve siRNA delivery, which implied a difference in the design space of the optimized formulation parameters for siRNA and mRNA. In addition, Sato et al. [169] reported a two-step DoE approach to the preparation of liver-targeted, mRNA-loaded LNPs with pH-sensitive cationic lipids and an iLiNP device in which they optimized several formulation parameters including the nitrogen-to-phosphorus ratio, cationic lipid concentration, phospholipid concentration, and molar ratio of lipids and analyzed a variety of responses including the physicochemical properties, gene expression, and liver specificity. These results suggested that the LNP size and PEG/phospholipid ratio are key factors in promoting liver-specific gene expression and that this \"multi-response DoE\" approach can be applied to predict important parameters of LNP preparation and optimize the LNP@mRNA formulation more effectively. \n\nMelissa P.

Entrapment of siRNA refers to the percentage of siRNA in solution that is incorporated into the nanoparticle during formulation, as measured by an RNA dye-binding assay 33 . These results are in keeping with a previous finding that efficacious lipidoid nanoparticles often have entrapment values of approximately 75% 4 . Zeta potential measurements were conducted under neutral pH conditions. pKa values, which were obtained using a 2-(p-toluidino) naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid (TNS) assay, evaluated the pKa of the nanoparticle surface 34 . The pKa values of top LNP candidates corroborate the results of another study in which surface pKa values in the 6 -7 range conveyed efficacy in vivo 35 .\n\nSeveral analyses were performed to assess the biodistribution of the lead compound, 304O 13 , in mice. For these experiments, nanoparticles were formulated with Cy5.5-labeled siRNA. Whole organ IVIS images (Fig. 4a) and Odyssey scans ( Fig. 4b) showed that naked siRNA accumulated in the kidneys at 1 hour post-injection, suggesting rapid renal clearance. Quantification of IVIS signal indicated that 14%, 1%, and 71% of naked siRNA signal appeared in the liver, spleen, and kidneys, respectively. In contrast, at 1 hour post injection, 304O 13 localized primarily within the liver (42%) and spleen (24%), with only 18% distributing to the kidneys.\n\nGiven their effectiveness for silencing the hepatocellular target, FVII, we examined how 304O 13 nanoparticles were distributing within the liver. Confocal imaging was performed on liver tissues harvested one hour post-injection and stained with nuclear, actin, and macrophage markers (Fig. 4c). Images were taken near the central vein in liver lobules (black void near the center of images). Hepatocytes are outlined in green and macrophages, which appear sporadically, are colored magenta. Only 304O 13 was able to mediate siRNA accumulation throughout nearly all",

            "text": "In order to further improve the therapeutic index of siRNA-LNP, its biodegradable version, L319, was develop by adding ester bonds to the hydrophobic dialkyl chains, which enables the rapid elimination of siRNA-LNPs in the liver [83]. ATX lipids (Arcturus) were also designed to contain an ionizable amino head group and a biodegradable lipid backbone, which can degrade and scavenge in the liver much faster than Dlin-MC3-DMA [84]. Embedding biodegradable linker fragments in lipids may improve their biocompatibility and further promote their elimination in vivo [83]. Therefore, it is important to develop new next-generation lipids with a superior potency and biodegradable functions to further promote the development of the LNP platform. \n\nThe main advantages of LNPs as DDSs include the tailored optimization of biophysical and biological characteristics to achieve efficient encapsulation and controlled release. The current review focused on the research overview of LNPs as a mRNA DDS. In addition to the LNPs previously mentioned, other types of lipid-based mRNA DDSs include hybrid biopolymers, lipoplexes (LPXs), lipopolyplexes (LPPs), and nanocapsules (LNCs). Recently, lipid polymer hybrid nanoparticles (LPNs) have served as promising biomaterials for RNA delivery that integrate the physicochemical properties of both lipids and the polymers. The LPN can effectively protect and deliver mRNA to achieve the correct expression of the corresponding protein. A study has shown that poly\u03b2-amino lipids (PBAEs) were coated with phospholipid bilayers, and then the mRNA was loaded onto the surface of the nanoparticles by an electrostatic interaction to deliver mRNA vaccines through nasal mucosa [85]. The results indicate that the LPN/mRNA complex is readily taken up by dendritic cells (DC S ) and can deliver mRNA into the cytoplasm of DCs to reduce toxicity [85].",

The addition of an anionic lipid reduced pK a , whereas the addition of a cationic lipid increased pK a , which affected the interaction with plasma proteins and the formation of the protein corona (Dilliard et al., 2021). Results of their proteomic analysis of the protein corona suggested that targeting to the liver takes place with predominance of the ApoE protein in the protein corona; to lungs, with predominance of the \u03b22-GPI protein; and to the spleen, with predominance of the VTN protein. Incubation of these proteins with the LNPs in vitro also enabled specific LNP targeting (Dilliard et al., 2021). \n\nThose authors proposed a three-stage mechanism underlying the targeting of a five-component LNP (Dilliard et al., 2021). The first stage is the dissociation of the PEGylated lipid from the surface of LNPs; the second is the binding of SORT-lipid to blood proteins; and the third stage is the binding of proteins (adhering to the  Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org 09 particle) to tissue-specific receptors. In the case of PEG with a longer aliphatic anchor, which shows worse desorption, the expression of the reporter protein in all organs was noticeably lower, thus confirming the above mechanism. In another study (Meyer et al., 2022), LNPs containing a positively charged group of the additional lipid and a PLGA polymer also got distributed into lungs and the spleen, and the distribution was influenced by the ratio of a cationic lipid (DOTAP) to an ionizable lipid (MC3).",

Enhancements like surface functionalization with targeting ligands and surfactant coatings improve brain uptake and access. \n\nThe LNP system, designed to deliver drugs and antibodies to tumor-associated myeloid cells (TAMCs), was brought to life through a meticulous formulation process. A lipid-based nanoparticle formulation, crafted with 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3phosphocholine (DOPC), cardiolipin, and cholesterol, forms a hydrophobic membrane with a phospholipid bilayer structure. These components create the perfect environment for the hydrophobic dinaciclib (a small molecule CDK5 inhibitor). The surface was then fortified with a DSPE-PEG2000 compound, a crucial element that stabilizes the nanoparticles, extends their circulation time in the body, and reduces their recognition by the immune system, thereby ensuring the reliable delivery of dinaciclib. The outer layer of LNPs was then functionalized with \u03b1PD-L1 by conjugating it with the terminal maleimide group of DSPE-PEG2000 to enhance their specificity in targeting cells expressing PD-L1. The modification with \u03b1PD-L1 enhances the specificity of the LNPs in targeting cells expressing PD-L1, which is beneficial for targeted drug delivery systems, particularly in cancer treatment. Cryo-EM images revealed that the spherical nanoparticles were less than 100 nm thick and were covered in monoclonal antibodies. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) showed that the \u03b1PD-L1-functionalized lipid nanoparticles (\u03b1PD-L1-LNP) were around 90 nm in diameter, slightly larger than nonmodified LNPs, and had a slightly negative charge, as indicated in the zeta-potential analysis.",

However, current clinical LNP formulations show high liver accumulation after systemic administration, which is unfavorable for the treatment of extrahepatic diseases, such as hematological disorders. Here we describe the specific targeting of LNPs to hematopoietic progenitor cells in the bone marrow. Functionalization of the LNPs with a modified Leu-Asp-Val tripeptide, a specific ligand for the very-late antigen 4 resulted in an improved uptake and functional siRNA delivery in patient-derived leukemia cells when compared to their non-targeted counterparts. Moreover, surface-modified LNPs displayed significantly improved bone-marrow accumulation and retention. These were associated with increased LNP uptake by immature hematopoietic progenitor cells, also suggesting similarly improved uptake by leukemic stem cells. In summary, we describe an LNP formulation that successfully targets the bone marrow including leukemic stem cells. Our results thereby support the further development of LNPs for targeted therapeutic interventions for leukemia and other hematological disorders.",

            "text": "The liver functions as the metabolic hub of the organism, significantly influencing the pharmacokinetics of many orally administered drugs and intravenously delivered nanomedicines through processes such as de novo lipogenesis (DNL) (45) and metabolism (46). These processes are intrinsically linked to the livers diverse activities. The livers capacity to catalyze drugs and facilitate oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, and conjugation reactions enables it to intercept and detoxify harmful chemicals, resulting in the accumulation and eventual metabolism of drugs within the liver (47). However, this can hinder some drugs from reaching their optimal sites of action, thereby reducing bioavailability, therapeutic efficacy, and potentially causing hepatotoxicity. Nanoparticles offer a promising alternative, as they can be more effectively concentrated in tumor areas compared to conventional materials. The liver can uptake nanoparticles through the reticuloendothelial phagocytosis system, which involves Kupffer cells and the deposition of nanoparticles facilitated by the heterogeneity of plasma proteins (2). Different nanomaterials, characterized by their unique structures and compositions (Figure 2), play varied roles and have been extensively utilized as carriers in drug delivery systems (DDS). Notably, liposomal nanomaterials (48,49), silica nanomaterials (50,51), and graphene nanomaterials (52,53) are among the most commonly used in applications targeting the liver and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). \n\nDespite their potential, nanomaterials are not without limitations. Key challenges in their application include toxicity, target specificity, local drug concentration, unstable drug release rates, and low bioavailability. For instance, some nanoparticles may disintegrate during transport to the target site, resulting in drug loss and diminished efficacy. A summary of common nanomaterials and their characteristics is provided in Table 2. Currently, the majority of research on nanomaterials is concentrated on PEG-based nanomaterials and lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulations. Different types of nanomaterials exhibit a wide range of applications.",

            "text": "The usage of nanoparticle technology as carriers could address the off-target issue. A mouse study of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) showed that the LNP-DP1, a cationic lipid nanoparticle, could be used as a carrier of miR-122 mimics in vitro and in vivo delivery to reduce the target genes miR-122 [177]. The hepatocytes took in the nanoparticles without any toxicity observed and resulted in an almost 50% reduction of HCC xenografts within 30 days [177]. Similarly, in a mouse model of NAFLD induced by the methionine-choline-deficient diet (MCD), miR-146b expression was significantly reduced. Lactosylated PDMAEMA (a water-soluble cationic polymer) nanoparticles effectively delivered the miR-146b mimic to the hepatocytes in vivo and alleviated the hepatic steatosis [178]. Another possible carrier is the extracellular vesicles (EVs), the naturally occurring small lipid membrane vesicles released by various cells. EVs carry bioactive components, including the ncRNAs in their cargos, and mediate the changes in the recipient cells [179,180]. Studies of EVs released from the normal hepatocyte and taken in by the activated HSCs show that EVs could suppress fibrosis [181,182], suggesting their potential to carry information to improve or prevent fibrosis. From these findings, the advancement of specific delivery tools or technologies will make the usage of ncRNAsbased therapy to suppress liver fibrosis possible.",

Interestingly enough, by modifying DKP-lipidoids with cleavable ester and unsaturated tails, e.g., OF-Deg-Lin, although still distributed to the liver more than the spleen, the spleen accounted for over 85% of the mRNA expression [154]. Incorporating oleic acid (OA) in LNP formulations significantly enhanced liver distribution [164], whereas replacing cholesterol with cholesteric acid enables LNPs to exhibit a splenic tropism [112]. Additionally, incorporating different helper lipids in LNPs is known to alter their interaction with serum apolipoprotein E (ApoE). Having DOPE in the LNP formulation leads to higher ApoE binding and enhances liver delivery.

[43] showed that nanoprimers could enhance the antitumor efficacy of irinotecan-loaded liposomes (with a diameter of 200 nm) for the treatment of colon cancer.Results from this study showed significantly enhanced biodistribution after application of the nanoprimer.Interestingly, an enhanced availability of the liposomes in the blood resulted in a longer liposome persistence in the head as well.In addition to the increased biodistribution to the head, application of nanoprimers showed a longlasting effect on the biodistribution which was clearly visible even after a 24 h separation between the intravenous injection of the nanoprimer and intravenous infusion of the therapeutic nanoparticles.\n\nSaunders et al. [42] report a preclinical study in mice where LNPs nanoprimers were used to increase levels of two types of LNP-encapsulated nucleic acid in systemic circulation: Human erythropoietin (hEPO) mRNA and Factor VII (FVII) siRNA.Intravenous nanoprimer pre-dosing 1 h prior to the intravenous administration of the loaded LNPs achieved the desired effects, in this case by increasing hEPO expression and by decreasing FVII expression by 49% (blood concentrations).In the same paper a prior liver panel 24 h after the last of three injections of nanoprimers (administered alone) showed no evidence of toxicity as measured by aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), albumin, and total protein levels.Furthermore, nanoprimer uptake by liver cells was shown to \"reduce KC's and LSEC's clearance activity without impacting hepatocyte uptake activity\" [Ibid.],thereby suggesting that the vital role of hepatocyte in metabolism, detoxification and protein synthesis had been preserved.",

            "text": "NAFLD is the most prevalent chronic liver disease globally, affecting approximately 25% of the world's population [1]. NAFLD is a clinical-pathological syndrome characterized by excessive fat deposition in the liver, encompassing simple steatosis (NAFL), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis, and even cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [2]. Moreover, individuals with NAFLD face an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and other conditions [3], posing a serious threat to overall health. Unfortunately, aside from lifestyle changes and weight reduction, there is currently no fully effective medical intervention to reverse NAFLD [4]. Therefore, exploring potential strategies to improve NAFLD is a pressing and crucial issue. \n\nAbnormal lipid-droplet accumulation is a significant characteristic of NAFLD. Currently, lipid-droplet biogenesis is considered a key factor leading to this phenomenon (REF). However, besides lipid-droplet biogenesis, the homeostasis of lipid droplets also requires a balanced degradation process, a significant portion of which is achieved through autophagy. Autophagy is a cellular degradation process that clears and recycles unnecessary or damaged cellular components within lysosomes [5]. When macroautophagy selectively degrades lipid droplets, it is referred to as lipophagy. As a form of selective autophagy, lipophagy refers to the process wherein LDs in cells are transported to lysosomes for degradation during energy deficiency, acute nutrient overload, or exercise stress, promoting lipid mobilization and turnover [6]. Research has demonstrated that there is a significant accumulation of lipid droplets in the livers of patients with NAFLD or animal models thereof, indicating an impediment in the lipophagy process [7]. This obstruction in the lipophagy process further diminishes lipid mobilization within cells, reduces lipid circulation, and exacerbates abnormal lipid accumulation in the liver [6], leading to further deterioration of the disease.",

            "text": "Although small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are specific silencers for numerous disease-related genes, their clinical applications still require safe and effective means of delivery into target cells. Highly efficient lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are developed for siRNA delivery, showcasing the advantages of novel pH-responsive lipoamino xenopeptide (XP) carriers. These sequence-defined XPs are assembled by branched lysine linkages between cationizable polar succinoyl tetraethylene pentamine (Stp) units and apolar lipoamino fatty acids (LAFs) at various ratios into bundle or U-shape topologies. Formulation of siRNA-LNPs using LAF4-Stp1 XPs as ionizable compounds led to robust cellular uptake, high endosomal escape, and successful in vitro gene silencing activity at an extremely low (150 picogram) siRNA dose. Of significance is the functional in vivo endothelium tropism of siRNA-LNPs with bundle LAF4-Stp1 XP after intravenous injection into mice, demonstrated by superior knockdown of liver sinusoidal endothelial cell (LSEC)-derived factor VIII (FVIII) and moderate silencing of hepatocyte-derived FVII compared to DLin-MC3-DMA-based LNPs. Optimizing lipid composition following click-modification of siRNA-LNPs with ligand c(RGDfK) efficiently silenced vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) in tumor endothelial cells (TECs). The findings shed light on the role of ionizable XPs in the LNP in vivo cell-type functional targeting, laying the groundwork for future therapeutic applications.",

The distribution of the nanoparticles was monitored 4, 24, and 48 h after administration using a fluorescence imaging system (Figure 6a). The initial observations indicated a uniform distribution of all LNPs across the body surface. However, ex vivo analyses at the 4 and 24 h marks showed that the nanoparticles predominantly localized within the liver and lungs (Figure 6b). LNPs containing DMKD demonstrated greater accumulation in the kidneys than those containing ALC-0315 and SM-102, with a concurrent reduction in serum fluorescence. \n\nRelative to other lipid nanoparticles, DMKD-based nanoparticles exhibited stronger fluorescence signals in the lungs and liver, whereas the spleen and serum showed relatively lower signals. This distribution pattern is considered to arise from the positive surface charge of nanoparticles, leading to enhanced entrapment in the reticuloendothelial system (RES) [41][42][43]. However, all nanoparticles, including DMKD-PS, were cleared from the body within 48 h. Thus, the in vivo distribution of DMKD-based nanoparticles, as well as others, was found to be disassembled, metabolized, and eliminated from the body within the same timeframe. RAW 264.7 cells, unlike CT26 cells, exhibit a balance between the rate of mRNA translation and protein degradation by proteasomes. This characteristic, stemming from the murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7, contributes to their efficient antigen degradation capability. As a result, achieving consistent expression of specific proteins in RAW 264.7 is challenging because of their potent antigen-degrading ability [37,40].",

            "text": "Nucleic acid therapeutics, such as messenger RNA (mRNA) and small interfering RNA (siRNA), play a critical role in in vivo nucleic acid transfection, by increasing or suppressing target protein expression for disease treatment. These approaches hold significant promise for addressing a wide range of common public health conditions. 1 However, due to its inherent characteristics, in vivo delivery of nucleic acids faces significant biological barriers. 2 The dense extracellular matrix (ECM), as the initial barrier, inhibits the transport of nucleic acids from the extracellular environment to the target cells. 3 Moreover, during circulation in the bloodstream, nucleic acids may be engulfed by the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS), leading to their accumulation in the spleen and liver. 4 Furthermore, only a few nucleic acids that successfully pass through the extracellular barrier face subsequent obstacles, such as cell membrane blockage and endocytic entrapment, due to their substantial molecular size and negative charge. These hindrances prevent their release into the cytoplasm as only 1-4% of nucleic acids can effectively escape from endosomes to fully perform their biological functions. 5,6 Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop ideal delivery strategies that not only shield nucleic acids from ribozyme interference but also enable them to overcome various biological barriers efficiently, maximizing their vital biological functions with minimal toxicity and high organ selectivity. 7 NPs are nano-sized, spherical particles normally used as carriers for encapsulating RNA for delivery purposes. 8 LNPs possess distinctive advantages, such as simple formulation, high stability, high encapsulation efficiency, efficient cellular internalization, endosomal escape capabilities, and low immunogenicity. 9 Their efficiency as RNA delivery systems has been well-documented in numerous reports, garnering widespread attention. 10,11 Typically, LNPs formulation consists of phospholipids, cholesterol, PEGylated lipids, and key lipids. Phospholipids enhance the cellular uptake of LNPs, while cholesterol, a natural component of the cell membrane, improves LNPs stability by filling intervals between lipids and promoting fusion with endosomal membranes upon uptake. 12",

            "text": "Similar to liposomes, LNPs are PEGylated and typically exhibit liver/ spleen distribution following systematic administration. Leveraging liver biodistribution, Onpattro\u00ae LNPs (ionizable lipid = MC3 with noncleavable lipid tails) are designed to treat liver hATTR amyloidosis [123,176]. The high liver accumulation of MC3 LNPs sparks the development of ionizable lipids with cleavable ester tails. Ester lipid tails have been used in clinically approved SM-102, ALC-0315 ionizable lipids, and many other structural derivatives sharing liver biodistributions for improving the biodegradability of ionizable lipids in liver [177]. On the lipidoid side, the classic lipidoid 5-tail piperazine-based C12-200 is known to target both liver and spleen when given intravenously [177]. The 4-tail piperazine-based 246C10, however, showed liver-only distribution in a CRISPR/Cas gene editing study targeting antithrombin (mAT) for treating hemophilia [11]. With 2 extra carbons in the lipid chain in 246C10, LNPs based on piperazine-based IC8 (246C12) were shown to distribute to the liver and spleen when delivering mRNA encoding B7H3 \u00d7 CD3 bispecific T-cell engagers (BiTEs) antibodies. The liver was targeted as an in vivo antibody factory for BiTEs expression and secretion to treat hematologic malignancies and melanoma [178]. LNPs based on modified diketopiperazine (DKP)-based lipidoids, e.g., cKK-E12 (non-cleavable saturated tails) and OF-02 (non-cleavable unsaturated tails), showed a highly liver-focused distribution with higher protein translation efficiency by OF-02 compared to cKK-E12 [153].",

Due to its unique mechanism, the body can maintain the level of cholesterol in the cell membrane within a suitable range [79]. The different types of lipid organization have important effects on membrane proteins. Many membrane proteins are more likely to be associated with specific types of lipid organization, which would lead to its physical separation in a bilayer with a lipid phase coexistence [80,81]. When genes or the environment change, the orderly arrangement of lipid organization becomes disordered; these membrane effects may cause discomfort in the human body. \n\nLNPs are nanoparticles formed by lipid components. When LNPs load genetic material into cells, the degree of impact on the morphology and function of the lipid organization is essential for the composition and dosage of the selection of LNPs. The development of more efficient and safer LNPs for intracellular mRNA delivery is a long-standing challenge. LNPs are one of the most effective means of mRNA delivery. We can select an appropriate lipid composition or modify its structure to improve its biodegradability in vivo, so as to improve biocompatibility, avoid the toxicity and side effects caused by lipid accumulation. At present, a series of studies mainly focus on the linker fragments of cationic lipids (ionizable lipids), such as esters, amides, and mercaptans [82]. Dlin-mc3-dma, ALC-0315, and SM-102 all contain ester-bond linker fragments. Lipids linking degradable fragments are often rapidly cleared from the body and can be used in multiple doses with fewer side effects. Dlin-MC3-DMA is an FDA-approved excipient. In order to further improve the therapeutic index of siRNA-LNP, its biodegradable version, L319, was develop by adding ester bonds to the hydrophobic dialkyl chains, which enables the rapid elimination of siRNA-LNPs in the liver [83].",

            "text": "Lipid-based gene carriers include liposomes (cationic or anionic), polymer and dendrimer nanoparticles. Cationic liposomes are capable of delivering genes to cells or tissues, and achieving maximal therapeutic efficiency with minimal adverse effects [1]. However, the use of cationic LNPs for in vivo DNA transfection is hindered by substantial problems; i.e. after intravenous administration, cationic LNPs bind to plasma protein and blood cells due to charge reaction. The resulting aggregates of carriers with proteins or cells block microcirculation or may be cleared rapidly [11,12]. The common formulations for in vivo gene delivery are DOTMA or DOTAP-DOPE or DOTAP-cholesterol (Chol). These formulations are highly serum-reactive [6,13]. Lungs are the major organ shown to be highly transfected probably due to the accumulation of aggregates of lipoplexes with serum proteins or blood cells when the lipoplexes are administrated intravenously [14]. For this reason, cationic LNPs were once used widely for gene delivery to the lungs; and later for treating lung cancers and metastasis with further optimization [10,15,16]. LNPmediated gene delivery to the liver is more difficult than to lungs. For the development of the gene carriers, cationic LNP formulations, such as DC-Chol, DOTAP-Chol, are available for delivering genes to various tissues [17]. A few LNP formulations targeting hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have been developed for improving efficacies of drug therapy [18,19]. In order to avoid the rapid clearance by the reticuloendothelial system (RES) and to increase the drug delivery through the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect to a tumor site by passive targeting, novel strategies, such as reducing particle size, minimizing rigidity of lipids, generating amphiphilic vesicles and shielding from the recognition by RES system, have been attempted in formulating lipid-based drug/ gene carriers [1,2].

This decrease is attributed to the lipophilic nature of DiR [36], as lipophilic substances are more readily metabolized by the liver [37].

Additionally, Figure 3C,D reveals that DiR-LNP accumulation in the liver was higher compared with free DiR, with lower fluorescence signals in other major organs, such as the heart, spleen, lungs, and kidneys.

            "text": "To explore the therapeutic potential of Skp2 in septic lung injury, we developed lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) that encapsulate Skp2 mRNA, including its Cap1 structure, Skp2 domain, and poly(A) tail (Fig. 7A). These LNPs were administered via tail vein injection after the mice underwent CLP surgery to overexpress Skp2. After the administration of Skp2-loaded LNPs, Skp2 was successfully expressed in the lungs (Fig. 7B, Supplemental Fig. 6B). The liver exhibited high LNP expression, which was attributed to the preferential accumulation of cationic LNPs in the lungs and liver. As the primary blood-clearing organ, the liver possesses a significant capacity for LNP uptake [44]. More importantly, mice injected with LNPs exhibited reduced mortality (Fig. 7C) and ameliorated lung injury (Fig. 7D,  E). Significant improvements in lung tissue injury after the administration of LNPs were further evidenced by reduced cell counts and total protein concentrations in the BALF, as well as reductions in the lung W/D weight ratio (Fig. 7F-H). The degree of ferroptosis in pulmonary epithelial cells was also significantly reduced after LNP infusion, as indicated by the decreased ferrous ion concentration (Fig. 7I), GSSG/ GSH ratio (Fig. 7J), and MDA content (Fig. 7K). The reduction in lung injury was further supported by decreased epithelial cell death in the lungs as shown by TUNEL staining (Fig. 7L, M) and reduced mitochondrial damage (Fig. 7N). These data suggest that overexpressing Skp2 is effective in ameliorating sepsis-induced ALI and highlight the potential of LNPs carrying Skp2 mRNA for the treatment of sepsis.",

            "text": "administration [54]. Moreover, it has been extensively demonstrated that the physicochemical similarity of the commonly referred to as LNPs to VLDL and the propensity to adsorb ApoE in blood plasma, enhances the accumulation of this kind of lipid systems in the liver and the internalization into hepatocytes via the LDL receptor [81]. Although the reports identified here for active liver targeting highlight the extensive efforts and strategies employed to efficiently deliver therapeutic nucleic acids to hepatocytes, LNPs have emerged as the most advanced non-viral carriers for delivering nucleic acids to liver. However, the hepatocyte-targeting ability of LNPs relays on endogenous mechanisms, and for this reason, scarce studies involving LNPs have been identified in this systematic review, focused on active targeting. In this regard, LNPs lacking any active targeting ligand have been studied to deliver mRNA encoding \u03b1-Gal A to hepatocytes of Fabry mice and non-human primates after i.v. administration [82,83]. Despite further studies with these LNPs have not been reported up to date, initial results showed the production of functional \u03b1-Gal A in the liver, which then was secreted into the circulation. Secreted \u03b1-Gal A was taken up by distal tissues such as kidney, heart, and spleen and attenuated substrate accumulation in affected tissues. These hallmarks, while valuable for liver hepatocyte applications, severely limit the use of these LNP technologies beyond the liver. Recently, a methodology termed selective organ targeting (SORT) has been developed, which enables controllable delivery of nucleic acids to target tissues [65]. SORT LNPs involve the inclusion of SORT molecules, such as chargebased lipids, that accurately tune delivery to extrahepatic tissues after i.v. administration. This strategy, added to the recognized efficacy of LNPs, represents a great advance in the development of systems targeting extrahepatic organs, and it has been included in at least two patents [84,85].",

            "text": "It became evident that structural changes to the ionizable lipid design could significantly improve the siRNA activity, as demonstrated for the plasma clotting protein Factor VII decreasing ED 50 (dose required to reduce target protein levels by 50%) from >10 mg/kg to 0.01 mg/kg to 0.005 mg/kg [52,53]. With hundreds of lipids synthesized and analyzed, a structure-activity relationship (SAR) was established showing the dependence of activity on the pKa of the lipid with the majority of lipids showing activity in gene silencing applications having a pKa ~6.2 to 6.5 [53,54]. Considering that the uptake mechanism of these LNP in the liver was mediated through a clathrin-mediated pathway [55], it was not surprising that the pKa of the ionizable lipid played an important role in activity by the destabilization of the endosomal membrane [56,57]. Endosomes are continuously acidified by the V-ATPase proton pumps [58], which transition the ionizable lipids that are neutral at physiological pH to a positive species once the endosomal pH drops below the ionizable lipid's pKa. This charge would facilitate the interaction of the ionized lipid with anionic phospholipids in the endosomal membrane to adopt a nonbilayer structure, hexagonal (H(II)) phase leading to endosomal membrane disruption and release of payload [57]. \n\nFurthermore, the high efficiency of gene silencing in the liver with siRNA-LNP was also driven by the propensity of LNP to accumulate in the liver, as 60-70% of injected dose rapidly accumulated within 30 min of systemic administration [59]. This preferential accumulation in the liver was directed in large part by both the physiological structure of the organ as well as an endogenous targeting mechanism. LNP are structurally similar to chylomicrons, a lipoprotein particle composed of triglycerides, phospholipids, cholesterol, and proteins, and interact with circulating apolipoprotein E (ApoE) [60,61].",

            "text": "Next, we validated LNP biodistribution and LNP-mediated mRNA expression patterns in mice, focusing on cell-specific LNP distribution and mRNA expression within the murine liver, the largest RES organ in mammals. For all wild-type mouse experiments, LNP-mRNA formulations were injected (i.v.) in 8-10 week old C57BL/6 mice (Figure 6a). To assess LNP distribution and functional mRNA delivery within individual hepatic and nonhepatic (i.e., spleen and bone marrow) RES cell types, mice were anesthetized, a trans-cardiac collagenase perfusion performed, (parenchymal and nonparenchymal hepatic) cells separated, and individual cell types detected using cellspecific antibodies (see Figure S7 in the Supporting Information for representative flow cytometry density plots). To monitor LNP biodistribution across RES cell types and tissues, LNP-mRNA formulations, containing a nonexchangeable, fluorescent lipid probe (1,1dioctadecyl-3,3,3,3-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine (DiD), 0.5 mol%), were administered ( Figure 6b). Importantly, this allowed us to full decouple and independently assess cellspecific LNP targeting and resultant mRNA expression. At 2 hpi, for both DSPC-LNPs and srLNPs (42.75 mg kg \u22121 total lipid), we observed extensive LNP accumulation within the mouse liver (Figure 6c,d) as compared to accumulation in other RES organs, namely bone marrow and spleen ( Figure S8, Supporting Information), the latter being a smaller but highly efficient unit of the mononuclear phagocyte system. [83] Notably, both LNP formulations distributed to all hepatic cell types, as has previously been described for LNP formulations based on Onpattro, [82,84] however, srLNPs showed significantly enhanced uptake (p < 0.001) in all liver cell types ( Figure  6c). Most strikingly, srLNPs yielded an approximately fivefold and an approximately threefold targeting",

            "text": "The physicochemical properties of LNPs such as particle size and surface charge are critical for siRNA delivery via systemic administration. When their properties are not satisfactory for systemic drug delivery, almost all LNPs injected are captured by the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) and rapidly eliminated from the blood, resulting in poor accumulation in a target tissue [108]. To avoid such unfavorable biorecognition, the particle size of LNPs is commonly in the range of 30 to 150 nm; and the surface of LNPs is often covered with PEG. Modification of LNPs with PEG is well known to enhance their dispersibility in aqueous solution and to improve their stability in the blood. On the other hand, the presence of PEG on the surface of LNPs reduces the interaction between LNPs and target cells, which reduction diminishes their internalization into the cells. Therefore, the formulation of PEGylated LNPs should be optimized for the purpose of PEGylation. The amount of a PEG-lipid conjugate for modifying the surface of LNPs strongly influences the physicochemical properties and gene-silencing efficiency of the LNPs [112,113]. It has been reported that the size of LNPs decreases as the proportion of the PEG-lipid conjugate in LNPs increases [31]. Increased PEG density on the surface of LNPs has been shown to reduce the immune response [114]. The structural differences in the length of PEG, fatty acids, and linker of the PEG-lipid conjugate used for modification of LNPs also strongly affect the potential of LNPs. LNPs modified with (R)-3-[(\u03c9-methoxy-PEG-carbamoyl)]-1,2-di-Ooctadecyl-sn-glyceride (C18) showed high blood retention but dramatically reduced gene-silencing effects in the liver [112,113]. This is probably because the interaction between LNPs and cells is reduced or the ability of LNP to adsorb ApoE is reduced, resulting in difficulty in uptake into hepatocytes.

            "text": "PEG-lipids have a significant impact on the key characteristics of LNPs, which include particle size and polydispersity [156], the stability of LNPs during preparation and in storage, the prevention of aggregation [157], the encapsulation efficiency of nucleic acids, circulation half-life, immune response, in vivo distribution and efficiency in transfection [158,159]. The PEG-lipids used in Comirnaty \u00ae , Spikevax \u00ae and in Onpattro \u00ae are ALC-0159, PEG-DMG and PEG-c-DMG, respectively. The biological activity of LNPs is impacted by the structure of the lipid tail in PEG-lipids. Incorporation of PEG-lipids into the LNP membrane occurs through the hydrophobic tail (composed of alkyl/acyl chains). PEG-lipids possessing longer tails exhibit reduced propensity for dissociation from the LNP. Mui et al. demonstrated that PEG-lipid desorption from LNPs in circulation, analyzed one hour after administering them in vivo, was 45% for PEG-lipids containing C14 dialkyl chains, and conversely PEG-lipids with C16 and C18 dialkyl chains displayed only 1.3% and 0.2% desorption, respectively [160]. The short-chained diacyl PEG-lipid PEG-carbamate-1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycerol (PEG-c-DMG), which was introduced in the Onpattro \u00ae formulation, tends to desorb from the LNPs upon intravenous administration. PEG-lipids with short lipid tails enable them to desorb from LNPs, allowing the particles to adsorb apoE, facilitating LNPs to endogenously target hepatocytes in the liver [32]. PEG-lipids serve to stabilize LNPs during their preparation and storage by creating a steric barrier that facilitates self-assembly and inhibits aggregation. Moreover, the specific type of PEG-lipid used has an influence on the circulation time of LNPs and their interactions with cells.",

The term \"nanoparticle protein corona\" refers to the layer of proteins that adsorb onto the surface of nanoparticles when they are present in biological environments, such as blood or tissue (Mahmoudi et al., 2023). This corona significantly influences the nanoparticles' biological behavior, affecting their circulation time, tissue distribution, cellular uptake, and overall efficacy in drug delivery applications (Monopoli et al., 2012;Lynch et al., 2006;Walczyk et al., 2010). Overview of the general experimental workflow for RES blockade in vivo experiments. NU/NU mice bearing PC346C tumors were systemically injected with dextran sulfate (30 mg/kg), liposomes (360 mg/kg) or PBS (control), followed by i.v. injection of siAR-PEG-DSG-LNPs containing 0.2 % DSPE-Cy5.5 at a dose of 5 mg/kg siRNA. Blood samples were collected via submandibular puncture (1 min and 1 h) and cardiac puncture (4 h), and Cy5.5 signal in serum was quantified by fluorescent spectroscopy. After 4 h, mice were sacrificed, organs perfused with PBS and tissues were collected for Cy5.5 and siAR quantification.

LNPs, particularly those with ionizable lipids, exhibit tissue tropism influenced by their charge, as observed in ApoE-dependent hepatic uptake [64]. To address excessive liver homing, a selective organ-targeting (SORT) strategy has been explored, incorporating specific lipid classes into LNPs for tissue-specific gene delivery [65]. Manipulating the charge of formulated LNPs using SORT molecules, such as DOTAP or 18PA, allows for lung-or spleen-specific gene delivery, demonstrating adaptability for therapeutic goals. Additionally, strategies for targeting specific cell subsets in the liver, such as hepatocytes and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, have been pursued by adjusting particle size and incorporating targeting ligands [65]. \n\nNovel ionizable amino lipids and an ASSET system, utilizing cell-targeting antibodies, have been employed to enhance tissue specificity [66]. Although challenges persist in achieving systemic delivery into tumors, RNA-lipoplexes (RNA-LPX) have shown promise in cancer immunotherapy by targeting antigen-presenting cells and inducing T-cell activation. The modRNA, such as 1-methylpseudouridine (m1\u03a8) RNA, contributes to reduced inflammatory responses and improved therapeutic outcomes in autoimmune disease models [22,67]. These studies underscore the importance of careful LNP design and RNA modification for tissue-specific delivery and therapeutic efficacy, providing valuable insights for advancing RNA-based therapeutics.",

            "text": "Liposome nanoparticles (LNPs) are currently the most advanced delivery system for mRNA vaccines. Originally used for the delivery of siRNA, LNPs have been proven to be safe and effective (Ariful et al., 2015). LNPs are stable particles composed of a lipid bilayer shell of cationic lipids, auxiliary lipids, cholesterol and polyethylene glycol (PEG) encompassing an aqueous core (Kuntsche et al., 2011), in which they can carry an mRNA payload. Dr. Pieter Cullis is a pioneer in field of liposomal RNA delivery. Pieter Cullis et al. found that liposome nanoparticles encapsulated antigen can enhance the immune efficacy and induce stronger immune response (Jong et al., 2007). This preliminary revealed the advantages of liposome nanoparticles encapsulation in immunology. Norbert et al. (2015) studied the effect of the route of administration on the delivery of mRNA by LNPs. They found that when mRNA-loaded LNPs were administered at doses of 0.005-0.25 mg/kg, subcutaneous, intramuscular and intradermal injections mediated the local expression of the protein encoded by the mRNA. They further demonstrated that intravenous and intraperitoneal injections also mediated systemic mRNA transport, enabling target proteins to be expressed in the liver for up to 4 days. Maja et al. (2018) evaluated the safety of LNP packaging of human erythropoietin (hEPO) mRNA in monkeys and rats. following intravenous injection of 0.3 mg/kg mRNA LNP, hEPO levels were highest at 6 h post-infusion and exceeded the expected effective exposure 100-fold at the maximal dose. Active hEPO protein was detected in both rats and monkeys, indicated by significant increase in erythrocyte mass. Some increase in white blood cell count, changes in coagulation parameters, liver injury and release of IFN-\u03b3-induced protein were observed in rats, while in monkeys, splenic necrosis, lymphocyte depletion and mild, reversible complement activation were observed. These pro-inflammatory responses may be minimize",

Here we present a new approach to treat MASH, termed \u201cFibrosis overexpression and retention (FORT)\u201d. In this strategy, we design (1) retinoid-derivative lipid nanoparticle (LNP) to enable enhanced mRNA overexpression in fibrotic regions, and (2) mRNA modifications which facilitate anchoring of therapeutic proteins in ECM. LNPs containing carboxyl-retinoids, rather than alcohol- or ester-retinoids, effectively deliver mRNA with over 10-fold enhancement of protein expression in fibrotic livers. The carboxyl-retinoid rearrangement on the LNP surface improves protein binding and membrane fusion. Therapeutic proteins are then engineered with an endogenous collagen-binding domain. These fusion proteins exhibit increased retention in fibrotic lesions and reduced systemic toxicity. In vivo, fibrosis-targeting LNPs encoding fusion proteins demonstrate superior therapeutic efficacy in three clinically relevant male-animal MASH models. This approach holds promise in fibrotic diseases unsuited for protein injection.",

However, our data indicate a marked disparity in the efficacy of the nanoparticles used in these studies. LNP B provided much greater delivery of ARG1 mRNA to hepatocytes in vivo, resulting in higher arginase hepatic protein (as demonstrated by western blot and functional arginase activity) and greater improvement in control of ammonia, arginase, and guanidino compounds along with a more pronounced effect on quantitative myelination of the cingulum bundle and striatum. It is not clear why LNP A was markedly less efficient than LNP B in hepatocyte mRNA uptake and functional activity for both luciferase and arginase 1. While LNP A is efficient at expressing luciferase protein in muscle/peritoneum near the site of injection, previous investigations have demonstrated that arginase expression in myocytes is ineffective in extending survival and successfully treating arginase deficiency in mice. 43 The studies described in Figure 1 did demonstrate exposure of the luciferase mRNA-formulated LNP in extrahepatic tissues; however, outside of the liver for LNP B and the muscle at the site of the injection for LNP A, these were at a low level or modest at best. Very low levels were detected in the brain, with slightly more modest levels detected in the heart, intestine, kidney, and lung. These extra",

            "text": "The expansion of gene therapies relies on continuous improvement of delivery platforms, such as lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) (1). Among standard components of a LNP-ionizable lipid, cholesterol, structural lipid, and polyethylene glycol-conjugated lipid (PEG-lipid)-ionizable lipids hold the highest interest due to the impressive variability of chemical structures that can lead to successful nucleic acid delivery (2). The search for lipids that help further improve nucleic acid loading and delivery efficiency is ongoing. \n\nLipid-based materials generally have a natural propensity for accumulation in the liver from intravenous administration (1), limiting the scope of the diseases that can be targeted in this approach. A few examples exist suggesting that the modification of lipid materials or formulation may divert the nanoparticles from transfecting the liver. For example, it is possible to bypass the liver by modulating LNP formulation components (3), thereby changing the composition of the superficial protein corona and directing the LNPs to the lung and spleen (4). Incorporating cationic lipids as the fifth [selective organ-targeting or SORT (3)] LNP component may result in lung transfection whereas anionic lipids lead to splenic transfection although the surface of nanoparticles exhibited neutral charges. Lung transfection was also achieved in the case of N-series lipidoids, likely following the same mechanism (5). These observations indicate that there are some common molecular patterns that may lead to organ-specific delivery. \n\nIn this article, we report the identification and development of ionizable lipids containing a thiophene core (Thio-lipids). The 2-aminothiophenes are considered privileged structures in medicinal chemistry owing to their ease of synthesis and a broad spectrum of activity. Despite the popularity of this chemical motif in medicinal chemistry, its utility in ionizable lipids has not been explored. Thio-lipids can be prepared through the Gewald reaction, which offers a great degree of flexibility in terms of lipid modification.",

To this end, a recent work 28 demonstrated that certain numbers of ionizable amine lipids by varying formulations based on the linker moieties, gaining insight on how to build new structures of LNPs, administered beyond liver. Since the variation in the linker region could efficiently influence the efficiency of the lipids' delivery, three commonly amino molecules are used for surface modification: hydrazine, hydroxylamine, and ethanolamine. 28 The LNPs were synthesized by using a microfluidic mixing device, and the system contained a ionizable lipid, cholesterol, 1,",

Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are the most promising carriers for producing clinically approved products in the future. Compared with other systems used for nonviral gene delivery, LNPs provide several advantages including higher stability, low toxicity, and greater efficiency. Additionally, systems based on LNPs can be modified with ligands and devices for controlled biodistribution and internalization into specific cells. Efforts are ongoing to improve the efficiency of lipid-based gene vectors. These efforts depend on the appropriate design of nanocarriers as well as the development of new lipids with improved gene delivery ability. Several ionizable lipids have recently been developed and have shown dramatically improved efficiency. However, enhancing the ability of nanocarriers to target specific cells in the body remains the most difficult challenge. Systemically administered LNPs can access organs in which the capillaries are characterized by the presence of fenestrations, such as the liver and spleen. The liver has received the most attention to date, although targeted delivery to the spleen has recently emerged as a promising tool for modulating the immune system. In this review, we discuss recent advances in the use of LNPs for cell-specific targeted delivery of nucleic acids. We focus mainly on targeting liver hepatocytes and spleen immune cells as excellent targets for gene therapy. We also discuss the potential of endothelial cells as an alternate approach for targeting organs with a continuous endothelium.",

Abbreviations: UTR: untranslated region; LNP: lipidbased nanoparticles; TME: tumor microenvironment condensation process and spontaneously form lipid vesicles while entrapping the mRNA. Standard components of such LNP delivery system are (1) a cationic lipid, which complexes the negatively charged RNA and facilitates cytosolic delivery, in combination with other structural \"helper\" lipids such as (2) cholesterol, (3) phospholipids and (4) a diffusible polyethylene glycol (PEG)-conjugated lipid. \n\nA critical step in the optimization of LNPs, initially for the delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA), was the introduction of a new class of \"ionizable\" cationic lipids. Most prominent examples are LNPs composed with D-Lin-MC3-DMA or the lipidoid C12-200 [36][37][38]. The apparent pKa value of these ionizable lipids (pKa < 7) makes these lipids positively charged during the RNA complexation (at low pH), but LNPs remain relatively neutral at physiological pH. In comparison to formulations previously used for gene delivery, ionizable LNPs were found to be much more powerful to transfect liver cells, while charge-related toxicities could be minimized. A study by Akinc et al. [39] demonstrated that this could be attributed to the absorption of apolipoprotein E and enhanced receptor-mediated clearance by hepatocytes via the low-density lipoprotein receptor. Follow-up studies demonstrated that by optimally adjusting parameters such as the molar ratios of lipids, the lipidto-RNA ratio, and/or type of phospholipid in the particle, liver targeting could be further improved which eventually revolutionized the field with the approval of Patisiran as a first-of-its-kind siRNA therapeutic in humans [40].",

PEG was found to be a particularly important factor in enhancing dispersion stability and to efficiently package for poorly water-solubility molecules such as CoQ 10 . PEG can also control pharmacokinetics including blood retention and physicochemical properties of the formulation by differences in the head structure and lipid scaffold structure 30 . To achieve purposeful LNP preparation an adequate PEG should be used and the ratios should be optimized. \n\nBiodistribution evaluations showed that CoQ 10 -MITO-Porter largely accumulated in the liver after intravenous administration. In the case of induced liver injury, the delivery of LNPs to the liver was increased significantly (Fig. 5). CoQ 10 -MITO-Porter without R8 modification significantly decreased accumulation in liver and liver mitochondria 27 . The CoQ 10 -MITO-Porter was modified with R8 on the particle surface. The data for the www.nature.com/scientificreports/ resulting CoQ 10 -MITO-Porter were in agreement with previous reports in that R8-modified nanoparticles tend to accumulate in the liver 31 . The delivery of therapeutic molecules to hepatocytes is an important therapeutic strategy for the treatment of an APAP liver injury in order to reduce the levels of NAPQI, a toxic metabolite of APAP, in hepatocytes 18,19 . The capillary walls of the liver contain numerous small pores called fenestra. Therefore, the LNPs must pass through the fenestra and eventually reach hepatocytes. Since the fenestra diameter averages 141 nm and 107 nm for mice and humans, respectively 32 , the particle size needs to be controlled to less than 100 nm. The administration of 60 nm nanoparticles to mice caused a reduced APAP hepatotoxicity by allowing them to pass through the fenestra and easily access hepatocytes, as has been previously reported 33 .",

In the same cell model but using a different cationic lipid to formulate the LNP, Sahay et al. reported that downregulation of Cdc42 and Rac1 led to 80% decrease in LNP uptake, whereas inhibition of clathrin heavy chain-1 and caveolin-1 had little impact on LNP entry. 205 Together, these studies highlight areas in the design of LNP, which need further optimization and understanding to achieve efficient intracellular delivery.\n\nSince LNP delivery efficiency is influenced by the formation of a protein corona in biological media, one may expect that a healthy individual or a patient suffering of a pathology affecting the serum composition, will have different serum-protein diversity and concentration which could possibly affect the protein-corona composition of LNP and thus alter their activity in vivo, as observed for PLGA nanoparticles. 206 In addition, it is important to note that lipid self-assembly and therefore LNP morphology is driven by biophysical parameters including composition, temperature, pressure, electrostatics and lipid packing which have already been extensively reviewed and are therefore not addressed here. 207\u2212209 Therefore, the morphology and functional response of an RNA-LNP system administrated into a patient with abnormal body temperature (e.g., fever or low-body-temperature-related syndrome) may differ (e.g., protein-corona formation and delivery efficiency) when compared to a healthy volunteer. To date, LNPs have shown efficient delivery of RNA to the liver using passive cellular targeting (size control and protein adsorption). Compositional variations in LNPs have been demonstrated to enhance LNP accumulation in the lung and spleen; 210 however, delivery to other organs remains challenging. Like liposomal systems, LNPs can take advantage of \"natural\" and synthetic targeting processes to actively reach specific tissues and cells. The main strategies rely on proteins, peptides or natural ligands, antibodies or antibody fragments, as well as aptamers. Antibody-mediated targeting has demonstrated success in gene-silencing with LNP systems. As an example, Rameshetti et al. used an anti-CD4",

Phospholipids contribute to the encapsulation of nucleic acids and the stability of LNPs and usually represent only 10-20% of the total lipids in the formulation [285]. Phospholipids are used as structural lipids because they can spontaneously organize into lipid bilayers and have a high phase transition temperature thus ensuring the membrane stability of LNPs. Phospholipids are located at the periphery of LNPs, just like cell membranes, and PEG lipids are an important component in controlling the half-life and cellular uptake of LNPs [286]. During LNP assembly, PEG chains are located in the outer shell of the nanoparticles due to their hydrophilicity and large volume. PEG provides an external polymer layer for LNPs to hinder the adsorption of serum proteins and mononuclear phagocyte systems and prolong the in vivo circulation. PEG also prevents aggregation of nanoparticles during storage as well as in the blood [286]. Changing the properties of these components can produce LNPs with different properties, including different pharmacokinetic profiles and the ability to target different cell types.\n\nThe key advancement of the LNP formulation is that it enables efficient packaging and delivery of mRNA, allowing LNP to be widely used for in vivo delivery of exogenous mRNA, including in vivo introduction of Cas9-mediated gene editors. Anderson and colleagues co-packaged SpCas9 mRNA and chemically modified sgRNA via LNP and injected intravenously into mice, targeting Pcsk9 produced 80% editing efficiency and reduced and serum Pcsk9 to undetectable levels [287]. This result demonstrates for the first time the promise of therapeutic level gene editing in mice by LNP encapsulating both Cas9 nuclease mRNA and chemically modified sgRNA. Since then, researchers have shown that LNP can successfully introduce Cas9 in complex with sgRNA into crab-eating monkeys, which can achieve 73% TTR destruction in the liver and a corresponding reduction of",

The current generation of siRNA LNPs is so potent that a typical therapeutic dose represents <1 mg/kg of total lipid injected i.v., of which only 3% by weight is PEG-lipid. 5 Taking into account the specific activities of 14 C-and 3 H-labeled lipids available, we estimated an siRNA dose administered at 0.3 mg/kg (3.3 mg/kg total lipid) would be sufficient to provide a limit of detection equivalent to ~1% of the injected dose per animal. Although this lipid dose is low for typical liposome drug delivery systems, it is still tenfold higher than that required for a therapeutic effect using siRNA LNPs in mouse models. Therefore, to ensure the data obtained in these studies is relevant to therapeutic applications, an experiment was conducted to compare the PK of LNPs at 0.03, 0.3, and 1.0 mg/kg siRNA. \n\nLNPs encapsulating FVII siRNA were trace labeled with tritiatedcholesterylhexadecylether ( 3 H-CHE), an ether-linked cholesterol ester analogue. This lipid is nonexchangeable and nonmetabolizable in mice 14 therefore 3 H remains associated with particles in blood and tissues for at least 24 hours. LNPs were administered at total lipid doses of 0.33, 3.3, and 11.1 mg/kg (corresponding to 0.03, 0.3, and 1 mg/kg siRNA, respectively), and then blood, liver, and spleen samples were removed and measured for radioactivity over 24 hours. \n\nExpressed as % injected dose, all three concentrations show similar profiles for LNP clearance from the blood compartment and subsequent accumulation in liver and spleen tissues (Figure 1). Less than 5% of the injected dose remains in circulation after 4 hours and <1% after 24 hours (Figure 1a).",

However, the limited distribution of small molecule fluorogenic probes in the liver and their rapid clearance impair the accuracy of fluorescence imaging and in ILD diagnosis. In this study, an effective utilization of ionizable lipid nanoparticles (iLNPs) is presented as liver-targeted carriers for efficient delivery of fluorogenic probes, aiming to overcome biodistribution barriers and achieve accurate detection of hepatic biomarkers. Based on this strategy, a liver-targeted NIR fluorogenic nanoprobe hCy-H2O2@iLNP is prepared using hCy-H2O2 as a small molecule reporter for visualizing the over-produced hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in situ of liver. Notably, iLNPs not only significantly enhance probe accumulation in the liver, but also enable sequence activation of fluorescent nanoprobes. This response is achieved through primary liposome-dissociation release and secondary hCy-H2O2 response with pathological H2O2, enabling high-precision detection of oxidative stress in hepatocytes. These distinctive features facilitate accurate early diagnosis of acetaminophen (APAP)-induced inflammatory liver injury as well as lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced hepatitis. Therefore, the organ-targeted nanoprobe design strategy showcasts great potential for early and accurate diagnosis of lesions in situ in different organs.",

To date, anti-liver fibrosis drugs for clinical treatment have not yet been approved. Nowadays, as a natural regulator, Relaxin (RLX) has received increased attention because the expression of RLX could deactivate the activation of hepatic stellate cells (aHSCs) and resolve liver fibrosis. However, its application in treatment is limited due to the short half-life in circulation and low accumulation within the target organ.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTo address these problems, a kind of polymeric metformin (PolyMet)-loaded relaxin plasmid (pRLX) core-membrane lipid nanoparticle (PolyMet-pRLX-LNPs, PRLNP) was prepared. Here, PolyMet was used as a carrier to replace the traditional polymer polyethylene diene (PEI), which is of higher toxicity, to prolong the circulation time of pRLX in vivo. Then, the antifibrotic ability of PRLNP to overcome liver fibrosis was carried out in C57BL/6 mice. It is worth mentioning that this is the first time to investigate the potential of PRLNP in carbon tetrachloride-induced liver fibrosis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe results showed that PRLNP effectively downregulated fibrosis-related biomarkers such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Meanwhile, histopathological examinations also showed low collagen accumulation, revealing that PRLNP could histologically and functionally alleviate liver fibrosis.

Skeletal muscle as the largest organ in the body, makes it challenges for designing targeted drug delivery systems. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are widely used as a safe and efficient delivery carrier, there is limited research on LNPs that specifically target skeletal muscle. Results A LNP designed with five specific receptor complements on its surface, which specifically targets skeletal muscle in vivo in mice, without off-target effects on other tissues and organs. MiR-130a, a regulator of PPARG, which is a key factor in skeletal muscle lipid deposition, was encapsulated with LNP (LNP@miR-130a). In high-fat diet (HFD) mice, LNP@miR-130a effectively reduced skeletal muscle lipid deposition, increased exercise activity and enhanced muscle mass. Interestingly, the myokines in skeletal muscle have also changed which may leading to reduce the adipose tissue weight and liver lipid deposition in HFD mice. Conclusions These results indicated LNP@miR-130a is a promising inhibitor of skeletal muscle lipid deposition and may help alleviate obesity. This study provides new insights for obesity treatment and lays foundation for the development of targeted skeletal muscle therapeutics.

However, the safe and efficient delivery of mRNA therapeutics to the lungs, especially to different pulmonary cell types, is still a formidable challenge. In this paper, we proposed a cationic lipid pair (CLP) strategy, which utilized the liver-targeted ionizable lipid and its derived quaternary ammonium lipid as the CLP to improve liver-to-lung tropism of four-component lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for in vivo mRNA delivery. Interestingly, the structure-activity investigation identified that using liver-targeted ionizable lipids with higher mRNA delivery performance and their derived lipid counterparts is the optimal CLP design for improving lung-targeted mRNA delivery. The CLP strategy was also verified to be universal and suitable for clinically available ionizable lipids such as SM-102 and ALC-0315 to develop lung-targeted LNP delivery systems. Moreover, we demonstrated that CLP-based LNPs were safe and exhibited potent mRNA transfection in pulmonary endothelial and epithelial cells.

            "text": "Much of current clinical interest has focused on mRNA therapeutics for the treatment of lung-associated diseases, such as infections, genetic disorders, and cancers. However, the safe and efficient delivery of mRNA therapeutics to the lungs, especially to different pulmonary cell types, is still a formidable challenge. In this paper, we proposed a cationic lipid pair (CLP) strategy, which utilized the liver-targeted ionizable lipid and its derived quaternary ammonium lipid as the CLP to improve liver-to-lung tropism of four-component lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for in vivo mRNA delivery. Interestingly, the structure-activity investigation identified that using liver-targeted ionizable lipids with higher mRNA delivery performance and their derived lipid counterparts is the optimal CLP design for improving lung-targeted mRNA delivery. The CLP strategy was also verified to be universal and suitable for clinically available ionizable lipids such as SM-102 and ALC-0315 to develop lung-targeted LNP delivery systems. Moreover, we demonstrated that CLP-based LNPs were safe and exhibited potent mRNA transfection in pulmonary endothelial and epithelial cells. As a result, we provided a powerful CLP strategy for shifting the mRNA delivery preference of LNPs from the liver to the lungs, exhibiting great potential for broadening the application scenario of mRNA-based therapy.",

Herein, to address this issue, we report a strategy for imaging ClO- in living cells and DILI mice by harnessing a bioluminescent probe formylhydrazine luciferin (ClO-Luc) combined with firefly luciferase (fLuc) mRNA-loaded lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). LNPs could efficiently deliver fLuc mRNA into living cells and in vivo, expressing abundant luciferase in the cytoplasm in situ. In the presence of ClO-, probe ClO-Luc locked by formylhydrazine could release cage-free d-luciferin through oxidation and follow-up hydrolysis reactions, further allowing for bioluminescence imaging. Moreover, based on the luciferase-luciferin system, it was able to sensitively and selectively detect ClO- in vitro with a limit of detection of 0.59 \u03bcM and successfully monitor the endogenous hypochlorite generation in the DILI mouse model for the first time.

Yet, during chronic liver injury or acute severe hepatocyte death, proliferation of mature cells becomes exhausted. In these cases, alternative precursors of hepatocytes that derive from cholangiocytes have been identified in both human and rodent diseased livers.

Despite these two mechanisms of liver repair, end stage liver disease remains the 12th most common cause of death in the United States, begging for therapeutic strategies to harness mechanisms of liver regeneration. Here we demonstrate that delivery via nucleoside modified mRNA complexed to lipid nanoparticles (mRNA\u2010LNP) to the liver of the key hepatocyte mitogen hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) enhance hepatocyte\u2010driven repair, while delivery of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) mRNA\u2010LNP promotes cholangiocyte\u2010driven repair. We confirm specific hepatotropism of mRNA\u2010LNP via intravenous injection of firefly luciferase encoding mRNA\u2010LNP, with protein expression lasting about 3 days. In the liver, virtually all hepatocytes are transfected along with a subpopulation of endothelial and Kupffer cells. In homeostasis, HGF mRNA\u2010LNP efficiently induce hepatocyte proliferation. In a chronic liver injury mouse model recapitulating non\u2010alcoholic fatty liver disease, injections of both HGF and EGF mRNA\u2010LNP sharply reverse steatosis and accelerate restoration of liver function. Likewise, HGF and EGF mRNA\u2010LNP accelerate liver regeneration after acetaminophen\u2010induced acute liver injury with rapid return to baseline alanine transaminase (ALT) levels. Transient delivery of VEGFA in acute and chronic injured mouse livers via mRNA\u2010LNP induces robust cholangiocyte conversion to hepatocytes as well as reversion of steatosis and fibrosis.

Therefore, an understanding of the factors required for the efficient, selective, and safe delivery of siRNA is a great challenge for successful siRNA delivery. Herein, we report on the development of two pH-sensitive cationic lipids and their use in examining the impact of the acid dissociation constant (pKa) value, lipase sensitivity and the size of lipid nanoparticles on the biodistribution, and efficiency and cell specificity of gene silencing in the liver. An increase in the pKa value resulted in a significant change in the intrahepatic localization of siRNA and gene-silencing efficiency in hepatocytes and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). The sensitivity of the pH-sensitive cationic lipid to lipases was a major factor in achieving hepatocyte-specific gene silencing. Increasing the particle size can improve the LSEC specificity of gene silencing. As a consequence, we succeeded in developing both a highly efficient, hepatocyte-specific formulation, and the most efficacious LSEC-targeted formulation reported to date. These findings will facilitate the development of more sophisticated siRNA delivery systems.",

Methods We report herein on optimizing the targeting efficiency of a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) by manipulating the acid dissociation constant (pKa) value of its membrane, which reflects its ionization status. Instead of changing the chemical structure of the lipids to achieve this, we used a mixture of two types of pH-sensitive cationic lipids that show different pKa values in a single LNP. We mixed various ratios of YSK05 and YSK12-C4 lipids, which have pKa values of 6.50 and 8.00, respectively, in one formulation (referred to as YSK05/12-LNP). Results The pKa of the YSK05/12-LNP was dependent not only on the molar ratio of each lipid but also on the individual contribution of each lipid to the final pKa (the YSK12-C4 lipid showed a higher contribution). Furthermore, we succeeded in targeting and delivering short interfering RNA to liver sinusoidal endothelial cells using one of the YSK05/12-LNPs which showed an optimum pKa value of 7.15 and an appropriate ionization status (~36% cationic charge) to permit the particles to be taken up by liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. Conclusion This strategy has the potential for preparing custom LNPs with endless varieties of structures and final pKa values, and would have poten tial applications in drug delivery and ionic-based tissue targeting."

To successfully administer nucleic acids, one approach is to encapsulate them in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). However, LNPs administered intravenously substantially accumulate in the liver where they are taken up by the reticuloendothelial system (RES). Here, we administer prior to the LNPs a liposome designed to transiently occupy liver cells, the Nanoprimer. This study demonstrates that the pretreatment of mice with the Nanoprimer decreases the LNPs' uptake by the RES. By accumulating rapidly in the liver cells, the Nanoprimer improves the bioavailability of the LNPs encapsulating human erythropoietin (hEPO) mRNA or factor VII (FVII) siRNA, leading respectively to more hEPO production (by 32%) or FVII silencing (by 49%). The use of the Nanoprimer offers a new strategy to improve the systemic delivery of RNA-based therapeutics."

METHODS In this phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned patients with hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis with polyneuropathy, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive intravenous patisiran (0.3 mg per kilogram of body weight) or placebo once every 3 weeks. The primary end point was the change from baseline in the modified Neuropathy Impairment Score+7 (mNIS+7; range, 0 to 304, with higher scores indicating more impairment) at 18 months. Other assessments included the Norfolk Quality of Life\u2013Diabetic Neuropathy (Norfolk QOL\u2010DN) questionnaire (range, \u20104 to 136, with higher scores indicating worse quality of life), 10\u2010m walk test (with gait speed measured in meters per second), and modified body\u2010mass index (modified BMI, defined as [weight in kilograms divided by square of height in meters]\u00d7albumin level in grams per liter; lower values indicated worse nutritional status). RESULTS A total of 225 patients underwent randomization (148 to the patisiran group and 77 to the placebo group). The mean (\u00b1SD) mNIS+7 at baseline was 80.9\u00b141.5 in the patisiran group and 74.6\u00b137.0 in the placebo group; the least\u2010squares mean (\u00b1SE) change from baseline was \u20106.0\u00b11.7 versus 28.0\u00b12.6 (difference, \u201034.0 points; P<0.001) at 18 months. The mean (\u00b1SD) baseline Norfolk QOL\u2010DN score was 59.6\u00b128.2 in the patisiran group and 55.5\u00b124.3 in the placebo group; the least\u2010squares mean (\u00b1SE) change from baseline was \u20106.7\u00b11.8 versus 14.4\u00b12.7 (difference, \u201021.1 points; P<0.001) at 18 months. Patisiran also showed an effect on gait speed and modified BMI. At 18 months, the least\u2010squares mean change from baseline in gait speed was 0.08\u00b10.02 m per second with patisiran versus \u20100.24\u00b10.04 m per second with placebo (difference, 0.31 m per second; P<0.001), and the least\u2010squares mean change from baseline in the modified BMI was \u20103.7\u00b19.6 versus \u2010119.4\u00b114.5 (difference, 115.7; P<0.001). Approximately 20% of the patients who received patisiran and 10% of those who received placebo had mild or moderate infusion\u2010related reactions; the overall incidence and types of adverse events were similar in the two groups.

This results in the accumulation of LNPs in the liver, posing a limitation for their use in targeting non-hepatic tissues or organs. To overcome this challenge and expand the utility of LNPs beyond hepatic applications, researchers have been developing various innovative strategies. One such approach involves localized LNP injections, where Palanki and colleagues have successfully identified the most effective LNPs in the perinatal mouse brain by administering intracerebroventricular (ICV) injections in fetal and neonatal mice (Palanki et al., 2023). Another strategy is the use of DNA barcoding to identify non-hepatic cell-tropic LNPs (Dahlman et al., 2017;(Newby et al., 2021). This method leverages unique DNA barcodes to modify distinct LNPs, resulting in a highly selective and efficient nanodelivery system targeted towards specific cells or tissues. Targeted modification of LNPs to achieve redirection is also a promising approach.",

This results in the accumulation of LNPs in the liver, posing a limitation for their use in targeting non-hepatic tissues or organs. To overcome this challenge and expand the utility of LNPs beyond hepatic applications, researchers have been developing various innovative strategies. One such approach involves localized LNP injections, where Palanki and colleagues have successfully identified the most effective LNPs in the perinatal mouse brain by administering intracerebroventricular (ICV) injections in fetal and neonatal mice (Palanki et al., 2023). Another strategy is the use of DNA barcoding to identify non-hepatic cell-tropic LNPs (Dahlman et al., 2017;(Newby et al., 2021). This method leverages unique DNA barcodes to modify distinct LNPs, resulting in a highly selective and efficient nanodelivery system targeted towards specific cells or tissues. Targeted modification of LNPs to achieve redirection is also a promising approach."

Using a series of lipid nanoparticles with distinct organ-targeting properties, we provide evidence for a plausible mechanism of action for nanoparticle delivery to non-liver tissues.

Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a clinically mature technology for the delivery of genetic medicines but have limited therapeutic applications due to liver accumulation. Recently, our laboratory developed selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles that expand the therapeutic applications of genetic medicines by enabling delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) and gene editing systems to non-liver tissues. SORT nanoparticles include a supplemental SORT molecule whose chemical structure determines the LNP\u2019s tissue-specific activity. To understand how SORT nanoparticles surpass the delivery barrier of liver hepatocyte accumulation, we studied the mechanistic factors which define their organ-targeting properties. We discovered that the chemical nature of the added SORT molecule controlled biodistribution, global/apparent pKa, and serum protein interactions of SORT nanoparticles. Additionally, we provide evidence for an endogenous targeting mechanism whereby organ targeting occurs via 1) desorption of poly(ethylene glycol) lipids from the LNP surface, 2) binding of distinct proteins to the nanoparticle surface because of recognition of exposed SORT molecules, and 3) subsequent interactions between surface-bound proteins and cognate receptors highly expressed in specific tissues. These findings establish a crucial link between the molecular composition of SORT nanoparticles and their unique and precise organ-targeting properties and suggest that the recruitment of specific proteins to a nanoparticle\u2019s surface can enable drug delivery beyond the liver.",

We found that apolipoprotein E (apoE), which plays a major role in the clearance and hepatocellular uptake of physiological lipoproteins, also acts as an endogenous targeting ligand for ionizable LNPs (iLNPs), but not cationic LNPs (cLNPs). The role of apoE was investigated using both in vitro studies employing recombinant apoE and in vivo studies in wild-type and apoE-/- mice. Receptor dependence was explored in vitro and in vivo using low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR-/-)-deficient mice. As an alternative to endogenous apoE-based targeting, we developed a targeting approach using an exogenous ligand containing a multivalent N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)-cluster, which binds with high affinity to the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) expressed on hepatocytes. Both apoE-based endogenous and GalNAc-based exogenous targeting appear to be highly effective strategies for the delivery of iLNPs to liver."

Here, we addressed this issue by in situ stealth coating of liver sinusoids using linear or two-armed poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)\u2013conjugated oligo(l-lysine) (OligoLys). PEG-OligoLys selectively attached to liver sinusoids for PEG coating, leaving the endothelium of other tissues uncoated and, thus, accessible to the nanomedicines.

They often regulate the activity of other cells and play an important role in many hepatic diseases. In response to those pathological situations, they are activated, releasing cytokines and chemokines; they may attract circulating monocytes and exert functions that can aggravate the symptoms or drive reparation processes. As a result, liver macrophages are potential therapeutic targets that can be oriented toward a variety of aims, with emergent nanotechnology platforms potentially offering new perspectives for macrophage vectorization. Macrophages play an essential role in the final destination of nanoparticles (NPs) in the organism, as they are involved in their uptake and trafficking in vivo. Different types of delivery nanosystems for macrophage recognition and targeting, such as liposomes, solid-lipid, polymeric, or metallic nanoparticles, have been developed. Passive targeting promotes the accumulation of the NPs in the liver due to their anatomical and physiological features. This process is modulated by NP characteristics such as size, charge, and surface modifications. Active targeting approaches with specific ligands may also be used to reach liver macrophages. In order to design new systems, the NP recognition mechanism of macrophages must be understood, taking into account that variations in local microenvironment may change the phenotype of macrophages in a way that will affect the uptake and toxicity of NPs. This kind of information may be applied to diseases where macrophages play a pathogenic role, such as metabolic disorders, infections, or cancer. The kinetics of nanoparticles strongly affects their therapeutic efficacy when administered in vivo. Release kinetics could predict the behavior of nanosystems targeting macrophages and be applied to improve their characteristics. PBPK models have been developed to characterize nanoparticle biodistribution in organs of the reticuloendothelial system (RES) such as liver or spleen. Another controversial issue is the possible toxicity of non-degradable nanoparticles, which in many cases accumulate in high percentages in macrophage clearance organs such as the liver, spleen, and kidney.",

Patisiran is likely to serve as a prototype for the development of further intelligent drug solutions for use in targeted therapy.

While lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are approved vehicles for small interfering RNA delivery, there are still challenges to use this formulation for mRNA delivery. LNPs are typically a mixture of a cationic lipid, distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC), cholesterol, and a PEG-lipid. The structural characterization of mRNA-containing LNPs (mRNA-LNPs) is crucial for a full understanding of the way in which they function, but this information alone is not enough to predict their fate upon entering the bloodstream. The biodistribution and cellular uptake of LNPs are affected by their surface composition as well as by the extracellular proteins present at the site of LNP administration, e.g., apolipoproteinE (ApoE). ApoE, being responsible for fat transport in the body, plays a key role in the LNP\u2019s plasma circulation time. In this work, we use small-angle neutron scattering, together with selective lipid, cholesterol, and solvent deuteration, to elucidate the structure of the LNP and the distribution of the lipid components in the absence and the presence of ApoE. While DSPC and cholesterol are found to be enriched at the surface of the LNPs in buffer, binding of ApoE induces a redistribution of the lipids at the shell and the core, which also impacts the LNP internal structure, causing release of mRNA. The rearrangement of LNP components upon ApoE incubation is discussed in terms of potential relevance to LNP endosomal escape."

Introduction/Background: This section should synthesize information about why LNPs accumulate in the liver and the basic mechanisms involved. This provides essential context for understanding the strategies. There are several quotes (especially 2, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 15) that explain the mechanisms of liver uptake that would form a good background section.\n\n2. Physical Properties Modification: Several quotes (0, 1, 14) discuss how modifying the physical properties of LNPs like size, charge, and composition affects liver distribution. This should be a synthesis paragraph as it requires explaining the relationships between these properties and their effects.\n\n3. PEGylation Strategies: Multiple quotes (1, 7, 8, 15) discuss how PEG-lipid content and modification affects liver accumulation. This should be synthesized to explain the relationship between PEGylation and liver targeting.\n\n4. Surface Modification with Targeting Ligands: Quotes 1, 5, 7, 11, 14 discuss adding specific ligands to redirect LNPs. This works well as a synthesis explaining how these modifications work.\n\n5. Pre-treatment Strategies: Quotes 5, 6, 7, 13, 16 mention approaches like using nanoprimers, RES-blockade, and Kupffer cell saturation prior to LNP administration. This should be synthesized to explain the mechanism and effects.\n\n6. Alternative Formulation Approaches: Quotes 3, 11, 12, 14 discuss changing the lipid composition or removing components like cholesterol. This is best presented as a synthesis explaining how these modifications work.\n\n7. Genetic/RNA Modification Strategies: Quote 6 mentions clever mRNA modifications that can reduce liver expression. This is a distinct approach that deserves its own section, though with fewer quotes supporting it.\n\nI've arranged these dimensions in a logical order - starting with background, then moving from simpler physical modifications to more complex strategies and finally to genetic approaches. Each section requires synthesis rather than listing, as the strategies need explanation of how and why they work.",

Understanding these mechanisms has led to strategies that either enhance hepatic targeting or redirect LNPs to non-hepatic tissues. (13 sources)",
                "text": "\nLipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are clinically proven delivery vehicles for RNA therapeutics, with their strong propensity for liver accumulation being both advantageous for hepatic targeting and challenging for non-hepatic applications. The liver-targeting capability of LNPs is exemplified by Onpattro\u00ae (patisiran), the first FDA-approved siRNA therapeutic, which effectively treats hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis by delivering siRNA to hepatocytes <Paper corpusId=\"205102839\" paperTitle=\"(Adams et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"254671103\" paperTitle=\"(Han et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. Understanding the mechanisms underlying liver accumulation is crucial for both optimizing hepatic delivery and developing strategies to overcome this bias for non-hepatic applications.\n\nThe primary mechanism driving LNP liver accumulation involves apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-mediated targeting. After intravenous administration, PEG-lipids with short lipid tails tend to desorb from the LNP surface, allowing blood proteins, particularly ApoE, to adsorb and form a protein corona <Paper corpusId=\"274333034\" paperTitle=\"(Catenacci et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"232322928\" paperTitle=\"(Sebastiani et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. This physicochemical similarity of LNPs to very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) enhances their interaction with ApoE <Paper corpusId=\"268998096\" paperTitle=\"(Rodriguez-Castejon et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. Studies have shown that approximately 90% of injected ionizable lipids can be detected in the liver within 4 hours of systemic administration, highlighting the remarkable liver-targeting efficiency of these formulations <Paper corpusId=\"264387007\" paperTitle=\"(Yan et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe cellular uptake mechanism in hepatocytes follows a well-defined pathway: ApoE-coated LNPs are recognized by low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLR) on hepatocyte surfaces, triggering receptor-mediated endocytosis <Paper corpusId=\"238214772\" paperTitle=\"(Kawase et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"47397011\" paperTitle=\"(Akinc et al., 2010)\" isShortName></Paper>. Inside endosomes, the acidic environment protonates ionizable lipids such as DLin-MC3-DMA, which destabilizes the endosomal membrane. Combined with the membrane-fusing action of cholesterol, this facilitates endosomal escape, releasing the RNA cargo into the cytoplasm where it can exert its therapeutic effect <Paper corpusId=\"264387007\" paperTitle=\"(Yan et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"254671103\" paperTitle=\"(Han et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe size of LNPs also influences their distribution within liver cell populations. The diameter of liver fenestrations (50-300 nm) serves as a physiological filter, with LNP size determining whether they preferentially target hepatocytes or cells of the reticuloendothelial system (RES), including Kupffer cells and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) <Paper corpusId=\"250244349\" paperTitle=\"(Albertsen et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. For instance, strategically sized LNPs combined with surface modifications, such as mannose grafting, can selectively deliver RNA to LSECs while minimizing uptake by hepatocytes <Paper corpusId=\"232059366\" paperTitle=\"(Kim et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nTo overcome the liver accumulation bias for non-hepatic applications, several innovative approaches have emerged. The selective organ targeting (SORT) methodology involves incorporating specific molecules into LNPs to tune delivery to extrahepatic tissues after intravenous administration <Paper corpusId=\"268998096\" paperTitle=\"(Rodriguez-Castejon et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"245405261\" paperTitle=\"(Dilliard et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. Other strategies include pre-treating with \"nanoprimers\" to temporarily occupy RES cells in the liver prior to therapeutic LNP administration, which improves bioavailability and efficacy of RNA therapeutics <Paper corpusId=\"218480033\" paperTitle=\"(Saunders et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. Alternative approaches include localized injections, DNA barcoding to identify non-hepatic cell-tropic LNPs, and targeted modifications to redirect LNPs away from the liver <Paper corpusId=\"268356550\" paperTitle=\"(Xu et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.",

METHODS In this phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned patients with hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis with polyneuropathy, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive intravenous patisiran (0.3 mg per kilogram of body weight) or placebo once every 3 weeks. The primary end point was the change from baseline in the modified Neuropathy Impairment Score+7 (mNIS+7; range, 0 to 304, with higher scores indicating more impairment) at 18 months. Other assessments included the Norfolk Quality of Life\u2013Diabetic Neuropathy (Norfolk QOL\u2010DN) questionnaire (range, \u20104 to 136, with higher scores indicating worse quality of life), 10\u2010m walk test (with gait speed measured in meters per second), and modified body\u2010mass index (modified BMI, defined as [weight in kilograms divided by square of height in meters]\u00d7albumin level in grams per liter; lower values indicated worse nutritional status). RESULTS A total of 225 patients underwent randomization (148 to the patisiran group and 77 to the placebo group). The mean (\u00b1SD) mNIS+7 at baseline was 80.9\u00b141.5 in the patisiran group and 74.6\u00b137.0 in the placebo group; the least\u2010squares mean (\u00b1SE) change from baseline was \u20106.0\u00b11.7 versus 28.0\u00b12.6 (difference, \u201034.0 points; P<0.001) at 18 months. The mean (\u00b1SD) baseline Norfolk QOL\u2010DN score was 59.6\u00b128.2 in the patisiran group and 55.5\u00b124.3 in the placebo group; the least\u2010squares mean (\u00b1SE) change from baseline was \u20106.7\u00b11.8 versus 14.4\u00b12.7 (difference, \u201021.1 points; P<0.001) at 18 months. Patisiran also showed an effect on gait speed and modified BMI. At 18 months, the least\u2010squares mean change from baseline in gait speed was 0.08\u00b10.02 m per second with patisiran versus \u20100.24\u00b10.04 m per second with placebo (difference, 0.31 m per second; P<0.001), and the least\u2010squares mean change from baseline in the modified BMI was \u20103.7\u00b19.6 versus \u2010119.4\u00b114.5 (difference, 115.7; P<0.001). Approximately 20% of the patients who received patisiran and 10% of those who received placebo had mild or moderate infusion\u2010related reactions; the overall incidence and types of adverse events were similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS In this trial, patisiran improved multiple clinical manifestations of hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis.

                            "Moreover, studies have shown that upon IV administration PEG-lipid with short lipid tails tend to desorb from LNPs, inducing a change in surface structure that allows ApoE adsorption to LNPs, with the formation of a protein corona that affects their endosomal escape and mRNA release. ApoE in blood serum showed specificity for hepatocytes leading to LNP accumulation in the liver as exploited in Onpattro \u00ae formulation. In this product, the drug patisiran is delivered using LNPs composed of ionizable lipid (DLin-MC3-DMA), phosphatidylcholine derivate (DSPC), cholesterol, and PEG-lipid (PEG2000-C-DMG). Once the drug is administered into the systemic circulation, the PEG-lipid is replaced by serum proteins, mainly ApoE, which interact with the cholesterol component of the lipid complex and target the drug to the liver (Urits et al., 2020)(Sebastiani et al., 2021)."

                            "Emerging therapeutic treatments based on the production of proteins by delivering mRNA have become increasingly important in recent times. While lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are approved vehicles for small interfering RNA delivery, there are still challenges to use this formulation for mRNA delivery. LNPs are typically a mixture of a cationic lipid, distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC), cholesterol, and a PEG-lipid. The structural characterization of mRNA-containing LNPs (mRNA-LNPs) is crucial for a full understanding of the way in which they function, but this information alone is not enough to predict their fate upon entering the bloodstream. The biodistribution and cellular uptake of LNPs are affected by their surface composition as well as by the extracellular proteins present at the site of LNP administration, e.g., apolipoproteinE (ApoE). ApoE, being responsible for fat transport in the body, plays a key role in the LNP\u2019s plasma circulation time. In this work, we use small-angle neutron scattering, together with selective lipid, cholesterol, and solvent deuteration, to elucidate the structure of the LNP and the distribution of the lipid components in the absence and the presence of ApoE. While DSPC and cholesterol are found to be enriched at the surface of the LNPs in buffer, binding of ApoE induces a redistribution of the lipids at the shell and the core, which also impacts the LNP internal structure, causing release of mRNA. The rearrangement of LNP components upon ApoE incubation is discussed in terms of potential relevance to LNP endosomal escape."

                            "We have shown that our biodegradable LNPs were successfully incorporated into liver hepatocytes and led to effective knockdown of target mRNA expression. olipoprotein E (ApoE) and low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) are involved in the incorporation of LNPs into hepatocytes in vivo. Plasma ApoE preferentially binds to PEG lipids of the LNP surface. LDLR proteins on hepatocytes recognize ApoE-LNP complexes, resulting in LNP incorporation via endocytosis. LNPs become cationic due to reduced pH during endosome maturation, leading to LNP fusion to the endosomal membrane. siRNA is finally released into the cytoplasm, thereby inducing RNAi-mediated knockdown of target molecules in hepatocytes."

                            "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have proven to be highly efficient carriers of short-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to hepatocytes in vivo; however, the precise mechanism by which this efficient delivery occurs has yet to be elucidated. We found that apolipoprotein E (apoE), which plays a major role in the clearance and hepatocellular uptake of physiological lipoproteins, also acts as an endogenous targeting ligand for ionizable LNPs (iLNPs), but not cationic LNPs (cLNPs). The role of apoE was investigated using both in vitro studies employing recombinant apoE and in vivo studies in wild-type and apoE-/- mice. Receptor dependence was explored in vitro and in vivo using low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR-/-)-deficient mice. As an alternative to endogenous apoE-based targeting, we developed a targeting approach using an exogenous ligand containing a multivalent N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)-cluster, which binds with high affinity to the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) expressed on hepatocytes. Both apoE-based endogenous and GalNAc-based exogenous targeting appear to be highly effective strategies for the delivery of iLNPs to liver."

                            "Significance Liver accumulation represents a significant barrier in the development of therapeutically efficacious nanoparticle drug delivery systems. Using a series of lipid nanoparticles with distinct organ-targeting properties, we provide evidence for a plausible mechanism of action for nanoparticle delivery to non-liver tissues. Following intravenous injection, specific proteins in the blood are recruited to the nanoparticle\u2019s surface based on its molecular composition and they endow it with a unique biological identity that governs its ultimate fate in the body. An innovative paradigm emerges from this mechanistic understanding of nanoparticle delivery\u2014endogenous targeting\u2014wherein the molecular composition of a nanoparticle is rationally engineered to interact with specific proteins in the blood to overcome liver accumulation and to target specific organs. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a clinically mature technology for the delivery of genetic medicines but have limited therapeutic applications due to liver accumulation. Recently, our laboratory developed selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles that expand the therapeutic applications of genetic medicines by enabling delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) and gene editing systems to non-liver tissues. SORT nanoparticles include a supplemental SORT molecule whose chemical structure determines the LNP\u2019s tissue-specific activity. To understand how SORT nanoparticles surpass the delivery barrier of liver hepatocyte accumulation, we studied the mechanistic factors which define their organ-targeting properties. We discovered that the chemical nature of the added SORT molecule controlled biodistribution, global/apparent pKa, and serum protein interactions of SORT nanoparticles. Additionally, we provide evidence for an endogenous targeting mechanism whereby organ targeting occurs via 1) desorption of poly(ethylene glycol) lipids from the LNP surface, 2) binding of distinct proteins to the nanoparticle surface because of recognition of exposed SORT molecules, and 3) subsequent interactions between surface-bound proteins and cognate receptors highly expressed in specific tissues. These findings establish a crucial link between the molecular composition of SORT nanoparticles and their unique and precise organ-targeting properties and suggest that the recruitment of specific proteins to a nanoparticle\u2019s surface can enable drug delivery beyond the liver."

To successfully administer nucleic acids, one approach is to encapsulate them in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). However, LNPs administered intravenously substantially accumulate in the liver where they are taken up by the reticuloendothelial system (RES). Here, we administer prior to the LNPs a liposome designed to transiently occupy liver cells, the Nanoprimer. This study demonstrates that the pretreatment of mice with the Nanoprimer decreases the LNPs' uptake by the RES. By accumulating rapidly in the liver cells, the Nanoprimer improves the bioavailability of the LNPs encapsulating human erythropoietin (hEPO) mRNA or factor VII (FVII) siRNA, leading respectively to more hEPO production (by 32%) or FVII silencing (by 49%). The use of the Nanoprimer offers a new strategy to improve the systemic delivery of RNA-based therapeutics."

                            "One of the characteristics of conventional LNPs is their resemblance to low-density lipoprotein (LDL), which leads to their recognition and uptake by LDL receptors predominantly present in liver cells (Raguram et al., 2022). This results in the accumulation of LNPs in the liver, posing a limitation for their use in targeting non-hepatic tissues or organs. To overcome this challenge and expand the utility of LNPs beyond hepatic applications, researchers have been developing various innovative strategies. One such approach involves localized LNP injections, where Palanki and colleagues have successfully identified the most effective LNPs in the perinatal mouse brain by administering intracerebroventricular (ICV) injections in fetal and neonatal mice (Palanki et al., 2023). Another strategy is the use of DNA barcoding to identify non-hepatic cell-tropic LNPs (Dahlman et al., 2017;(Newby et al., 2021). This method leverages unique DNA barcodes to modify distinct LNPs, resulting in a highly selective and efficient nanodelivery system targeted towards specific cells or tissues. Targeted modification of LNPs to achieve redirection is also a promising approach."

                            "Important physicochemical characteristics that modulate intrahepatic LNP distribution and activity are particle size, apparent pKa value (and resulting surface charge), and lipase sensitivity (Sato et al., 2016). For clinical utility, it is also expected that these formulations display high entrapment efficiencies.\n\nA recent study by Chen et al. investigated how LNP size (30 nm -120 nm) influences gene silencing in hepatocytes (Chen et al., 2016). A clear hierarchy in gene silencing potency was observed with LNP-siRNA systems around 80 nm exhibiting maximum activity (78 nm > 42 nm > 38 nm >> 27 nm > 117 nm). This LNP size optimum results from a combination of two factors: 1) smaller particles being less active (less stable and less fusogenic); and 2) larger particles (>100 nm), not being able to access hepatocytes (limited by fenestrations). Sato et al. verified these results demonstrating significant reduction in hepatocyte gene silencing for LNP-siRNA sizes above the average liver fenestrae diameters (Sato et al., 2016). Interestingly, similar gene silencing activity in LSECs was observed for LNP-siRNA sizes up to 200 nm. This suggests that LNP sizes between 120 nm to 200 nm could be used for LSEC targeting.\n\nA key advance during the development of Onpattro\u00ae for hepatocyte gene silencing was identifying an optimized ionizable cationic lipid with an apparent pKa between 6.2 and 6.5 (Cullis et al., 2017)(Jayaraman et al., 2012). Further increasing the pKa value to 7.15 resulted in improved gene silencing in LSECs (Sato et al., 2016)(Shobaki et al., 2018). Incorporating ionizable cationic lipids exhibiting higher pKa values increased accumulation in the MPS, most likely due to scavenger receptor recognition [159]."

                            "While a variety of short interfering RNA (siRNA) delivery compounds have been developed, a deep understanding of the key parameters that determine the quality of siRNA delivery are not known with certainty. Therefore, an understanding of the factors required for the efficient, selective, and safe delivery of siRNA is a great challenge for successful siRNA delivery. Herein, we report on the development of two pH-sensitive cationic lipids and their use in examining the impact of the acid dissociation constant (pKa) value, lipase sensitivity and the size of lipid nanoparticles on the biodistribution, and efficiency and cell specificity of gene silencing in the liver. An increase in the pKa value resulted in a significant change in the intrahepatic localization of siRNA and gene-silencing efficiency in hepatocytes and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). The sensitivity of the pH-sensitive cationic lipid to lipases was a major factor in achieving hepatocyte-specific gene silencing. Increasing the particle size can improve the LSEC specificity of gene silencing. As a consequence, we succeeded in developing both a highly efficient, hepatocyte-specific formulation, and the most efficacious LSEC-targeted formulation reported to date. These findings will facilitate the development of more sophisticated siRNA delivery systems."

We prepared various LNPs loaded with mCre, and their size was ranging from 50 to 100 nm by varying PEG-lipid (%) (Fig. 5, A and B). For a change in the mole ratio of PEG-lipid, the change must be replaced with the mole ratio of other components. Mole ratio of PEG-lipid was varied by expending that of cholesterol",

                            "Introduction The development of targeted drug delivery systems is a rapidly growing area in the field of nanomedicine. Methods We report herein on optimizing the targeting efficiency of a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) by manipulating the acid dissociation constant (pKa) value of its membrane, which reflects its ionization status. Instead of changing the chemical structure of the lipids to achieve this, we used a mixture of two types of pH-sensitive cationic lipids that show different pKa values in a single LNP. We mixed various ratios of YSK05 and YSK12-C4 lipids, which have pKa values of 6.50 and 8.00, respectively, in one formulation (referred to as YSK05/12-LNP). Results The pKa of the YSK05/12-LNP was dependent not only on the molar ratio of each lipid but also on the individual contribution of each lipid to the final pKa (the YSK12-C4 lipid showed a higher contribution). Furthermore, we succeeded in targeting and delivering short interfering RNA to liver sinusoidal endothelial cells using one of the YSK05/12-LNPs which showed an optimum pKa value of 7.15 and an appropriate ionization status (~36% cationic charge) to permit the particles to be taken up by liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. Conclusion This strategy has the potential for preparing custom LNPs with endless varieties of structures and final pKa values, and would have poten tial applications in drug delivery and ionic-based tissue targeting."

                            "Hepatic macrophage populations include different types of cells with plastic properties that can differentiate into diverse phenotypes to modulate their properties in response to different stimuli. They often regulate the activity of other cells and play an important role in many hepatic diseases. In response to those pathological situations, they are activated, releasing cytokines and chemokines; they may attract circulating monocytes and exert functions that can aggravate the symptoms or drive reparation processes. As a result, liver macrophages are potential therapeutic targets that can be oriented toward a variety of aims, with emergent nanotechnology platforms potentially offering new perspectives for macrophage vectorization. Macrophages play an essential role in the final destination of nanoparticles (NPs) in the organism, as they are involved in their uptake and trafficking in vivo. Different types of delivery nanosystems for macrophage recognition and targeting, such as liposomes, solid-lipid, polymeric, or metallic nanoparticles, have been developed. Passive targeting promotes the accumulation of the NPs in the liver due to their anatomical and physiological features. This process is modulated by NP characteristics such as size, charge, and surface modifications. Active targeting approaches with specific ligands may also be used to reach liver macrophages. In order to design new systems, the NP recognition mechanism of macrophages must be understood, taking into account that variations in local microenvironment may change the phenotype of macrophages in a way that will affect the uptake and toxicity of NPs. This kind of information may be applied to diseases where macrophages play a pathogenic role, such as metabolic disorders, infections, or cancer. The kinetics of nanoparticles strongly affects their therapeutic efficacy when administered in vivo. Release kinetics could predict the behavior of nanosystems targeting macrophages and be applied to improve their characteristics. PBPK models have been developed to characterize nanoparticle biodistribution in organs of the reticuloendothelial system (RES) such as liver or spleen. Another controversial issue is the possible toxicity of non-degradable nanoparticles, which in many cases accumulate in high percentages in macrophage clearance organs such as the liver, spleen, and kidney."

However, systemically delivering mRNA to cell types besides hepatocytes remains challenging. Fast identification of nanoparticle delivery (FIND) is a DNA barcode\u2010based system designed to measure how over 100 lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) deliver mRNA that functions in the cytoplasm of target cells in a single mouse. By using FIND to quantify how 75 chemically distinct LNPs delivered mRNA to 28 cell types in vivo, it is found that an LNP formulated with oxidized cholesterol and no targeting ligand delivers Cre mRNA, which edits DNA in hepatic endothelial cells and Kupffer cells at 0.05 mg kg\u22121. Notably, the LNP targets liver microenvironmental cells fivefold more potently than hepatocytes. The structure of the oxidized cholesterols added to the LNP is systematically varied to show that the position of the oxidative modification may be important; cholesterols modified on the hydrocarbon tail associated with sterol ring D tend to outperform cholesterols modified on sterol ring B. These data suggest that LNPs formulated with modified cholesterols can deliver gene\u2010editing mRNA to the liver microenvironment at clinically relevant doses."

To successfully administer nucleic acids, one approach is to encapsulate them in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). However, LNPs administered intravenously substantially accumulate in the liver where they are taken up by the reticuloendothelial system (RES). Here, we administer prior to the LNPs a liposome designed to transiently occupy liver cells, the Nanoprimer. This study demonstrates that the pretreatment of mice with the Nanoprimer decreases the LNPs' uptake by the RES. By accumulating rapidly in the liver cells, the Nanoprimer improves the bioavailability of the LNPs encapsulating human erythropoietin (hEPO) mRNA or factor VII (FVII) siRNA, leading respectively to more hEPO production (by 32%) or FVII silencing (by 49%). The use of the Nanoprimer offers a new strategy to improve the systemic delivery of RNA-based therapeutics."

Strategic manipulation of PEG-lipid percentage, combined with targeting ligands, enables precise control over LNP distribution between hepatocytes, LSECs, and extrahepatic tissues. (10 sources)",
                "text": "\nPEGylation strategies represent a critical design element in controlling the biodistribution and cellular targeting of lipid nanoparticles. In liver-targeted LNP formulations such as Patisiran (Onpattro\u00ae), the first FDA-approved siRNA therapeutic, PEG-lipids with short lipid tails are designed to desorb from the LNP surface upon entering systemic circulation. This strategic design facilitates the adsorption of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) onto the LNP surface, forming a protein corona that mediates hepatocyte targeting through ApoE receptors <Paper corpusId=\"254671103\" paperTitle=\"(Han et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"205102839\" paperTitle=\"(Adams et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"274333034\" paperTitle=\"(Catenacci et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"221111247\" paperTitle=\"(Urits et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"232322928\" paperTitle=\"(Sebastiani et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe percentage of PEG-lipid incorporated into LNPs profoundly influences their size and cellular distribution within the liver. Kim et al. demonstrated that LNPs with 1.5% PEG-lipid content (approximately 68 nm in diameter) exhibited optimal hepatocyte targeting. These smaller LNPs efficiently penetrated liver fenestrations and showed maximum protein expression in hepatocytes. In contrast, increasing the PEG-lipid content beyond 1.5% produced larger LNPs that could not effectively pass through fenestrations, redirecting them to liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) instead of hepatocytes <Paper corpusId=\"232059366\" paperTitle=\"(Kim et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThis size-dependent distribution phenomenon has been leveraged to develop cell-specific targeting strategies within the liver. By combining high PEG-lipid content with surface modifications such as mannose conjugation, researchers have created LNPs that selectively target LSECs while minimizing hepatocyte uptake. The mannose receptor, predominantly expressed on LSECs, provides a mechanism for receptor-mediated endocytosis of these modified LNPs <Paper corpusId=\"232059366\" paperTitle=\"(Kim et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nFor applications requiring extrahepatic delivery, several PEG-based strategies have emerged. While simply increasing PEG-lipid content has not been sufficient to achieve prolonged circulation and redirection to extrahepatic targets, combining PEGylation with targeting ligands has shown promise. For instance, LNPs conjugated with antibodies against vascular cell adhesion molecules (VCAM-1 or PECAM-1) and CD-4 have successfully redirected LNPs from the liver to the lung, cerebral endothelium, and T cells in both lymph and spleen <Paper corpusId=\"253795111\" paperTitle=\"(Kalita et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nAn innovative approach to minimize liver accumulation involves reticuloendothelial system (RES) blockade strategies. Pre-treating animals with \"nanoprimers\" - liposomes designed to transiently occupy liver cells prior to therapeutic LNP administration - has been shown to reduce RES uptake of subsequently administered LNPs. This strategy enhances the bioavailability of RNA therapeutics, resulting in improved protein production for mRNA and better silencing for siRNA <Paper corpusId=\"253795111\" paperTitle=\"(Kalita et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"218480033\" paperTitle=\"(Saunders et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nAdditionally, a more targeted approach for in situ stealth coating of liver sinusoids has been developed using two-armed poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-conjugated oligo(L-lysine). This method selectively attaches to liver sinusoids, creating a PEG coating that prevents nonspecific clearance by the liver sinusoidal endothelium while leaving other tissues accessible to nanomedicines. Importantly, the two-armed PEG configuration is ultimately cleared from sinusoidal walls to the bile, avoiding prolonged disruption of liver physiological functions <Paper corpusId=\"272261048\" paperTitle=\"(Dinh et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"220110543\" paperTitle=\"(Dirisala et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.",

                            "BACKGROUND Patisiran, an investigational RNA interference therapeutic agent, specifically inhibits hepatic synthesis of transthyretin. METHODS In this phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned patients with hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis with polyneuropathy, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive intravenous patisiran (0.3 mg per kilogram of body weight) or placebo once every 3 weeks. The primary end point was the change from baseline in the modified Neuropathy Impairment Score+7 (mNIS+7; range, 0 to 304, with higher scores indicating more impairment) at 18 months. Other assessments included the Norfolk Quality of Life\u2013Diabetic Neuropathy (Norfolk QOL\u2010DN) questionnaire (range, \u20104 to 136, with higher scores indicating worse quality of life), 10\u2010m walk test (with gait speed measured in meters per second), and modified body\u2010mass index (modified BMI, defined as [weight in kilograms divided by square of height in meters]\u00d7albumin level in grams per liter; lower values indicated worse nutritional status). RESULTS A total of 225 patients underwent randomization (148 to the patisiran group and 77 to the placebo group). The mean (\u00b1SD) mNIS+7 at baseline was 80.9\u00b141.5 in the patisiran group and 74.6\u00b137.0 in the placebo group; the least\u2010squares mean (\u00b1SE) change from baseline was \u20106.0\u00b11.7 versus 28.0\u00b12.6 (difference, \u201034.0 points; P<0.001) at 18 months. The mean (\u00b1SD) baseline Norfolk QOL\u2010DN score was 59.6\u00b128.2 in the patisiran group and 55.5\u00b124.3 in the placebo group; the least\u2010squares mean (\u00b1SE) change from baseline was \u20106.7\u00b11.8 versus 14.4\u00b12.7 (difference, \u201021.1 points; P<0.001) at 18 months. Patisiran also showed an effect on gait speed and modified BMI. At 18 months, the least\u2010squares mean change from baseline in gait speed was 0.08\u00b10.02 m per second with patisiran versus \u20100.24\u00b10.04 m per second with placebo (difference, 0.31 m per second; P<0.001), and the least\u2010squares mean change from baseline in the modified BMI was \u20103.7\u00b19.6 versus \u2010119.4\u00b114.5 (difference, 115.7; P<0.001). Approximately 20% of the patients who received patisiran and 10% of those who received placebo had mild or moderate infusion\u2010related reactions; the overall incidence and types of adverse events were similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS In this trial, patisiran improved multiple clinical manifestations of hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis.

ApoE in blood serum showed specificity for hepatocytes leading to LNP accumulation in the liver as exploited in Onpattro \u00ae formulation. In this product, the drug patisiran is delivered using LNPs composed of ionizable lipid (DLin-MC3-DMA), phosphatidylcholine derivate (DSPC), cholesterol, and PEG-lipid (PEG2000-C-DMG). Once the drug is administered into the systemic circulation, the PEG-lipid is replaced by serum proteins, mainly ApoE, which interact with the cholesterol component of the lipid complex and target the drug to the liver (Urits et al., 2020)(Sebastiani et al., 2021)."

                            "Hereditary variant transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTRv) is a rare genetic defect that affects about 5000\u201310,000 people worldwide, causing amyloidosis secondary to misfolding of mutant transthyretin (TTR) protein fibrils. TTR mutations can cause protein deposits in many extracellular regions of organs, but those deposits in cardiac and axonal cells are the primary cause of this clinical syndrome. Treatment options are limited, but new drugs are being developed. Patisiran, a novel drug, is a liposomal siRNA against TTR that specifically targets this protein, reducing the accumulation of TTR in tissues, with subsequent improvement in both neuropathy and cardiac function. Patisiran is likely to serve as a prototype for the development of further intelligent drug solutions for use in targeted therapy. In this review we summarize the evidence currently available on the treatment of polyneuropathy in people with ATTRv with patisiran. We review the evidence on its efficacy, safety, and indications of use, citing novel and seminal papers on these subjects."

                            "Emerging therapeutic treatments based on the production of proteins by delivering mRNA have become increasingly important in recent times. While lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are approved vehicles for small interfering RNA delivery, there are still challenges to use this formulation for mRNA delivery. LNPs are typically a mixture of a cationic lipid, distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC), cholesterol, and a PEG-lipid. The structural characterization of mRNA-containing LNPs (mRNA-LNPs) is crucial for a full understanding of the way in which they function, but this information alone is not enough to predict their fate upon entering the bloodstream. The biodistribution and cellular uptake of LNPs are affected by their surface composition as well as by the extracellular proteins present at the site of LNP administration, e.g., apolipoproteinE (ApoE). ApoE, being responsible for fat transport in the body, plays a key role in the LNP\u2019s plasma circulation time. In this work, we use small-angle neutron scattering, together with selective lipid, cholesterol, and solvent deuteration, to elucidate the structure of the LNP and the distribution of the lipid components in the absence and the presence of ApoE. While DSPC and cholesterol are found to be enriched at the surface of the LNPs in buffer, binding of ApoE induces a redistribution of the lipids at the shell and the core, which also impacts the LNP internal structure, causing release of mRNA. The rearrangement of LNP components upon ApoE incubation is discussed in terms of potential relevance to LNP endosomal escape."

We prepared various LNPs loaded with mCre, and their size was ranging from 50 to 100 nm by varying PEG-lipid (%) (Fig. 5, A and B). For a change in the mole ratio of PEG-lipid, the change must be replaced with the mole ratio of other components. Mole ratio of PEG-lipid was varied by expending that of cholesterol",

Conjugation of targeting ligands on the LNPs surface proved to be effective in facilitating the uptake by specific organs in small-scale settings. For instance, conjugated antibodies targeted against vascular cell adhesion molecules VCAM-1 or PECAM-1 and CD-4 were employed to redistribute the LNPs from liver to lung, cerebral endothelium during brain oedema and in all T cells (na\u00efve, memory, central, and effector) in both lymph and spleen, respectively (Tomb\u00e1cz et al., 2021)",

                            "Despite tremendous interest in gene therapies, the systemic delivery of nucleic acids still faces substantial challenges. To successfully administer nucleic acids, one approach is to encapsulate them in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). However, LNPs administered intravenously substantially accumulate in the liver where they are taken up by the reticuloendothelial system (RES). Here, we administer prior to the LNPs a liposome designed to transiently occupy liver cells, the Nanoprimer. This study demonstrates that the pretreatment of mice with the Nanoprimer decreases the LNPs' uptake by the RES. By accumulating rapidly in the liver cells, the Nanoprimer improves the bioavailability of the LNPs encapsulating human erythropoietin (hEPO) mRNA or factor VII (FVII) siRNA, leading respectively to more hEPO production (by 32%) or FVII silencing (by 49%). The use of the Nanoprimer offers a new strategy to improve the systemic delivery of RNA-based therapeutics."

A major critical issue in systemically administered nanomedicines is nonspecific clearance by the liver sinusoidal endothelium, causing a substantial decrease in the delivery efficiency of nanomedicines into the target tissues. Here, we addressed this issue by in situ stealth coating of liver sinusoids using linear or two-armed poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)\u2013conjugated oligo(l-lysine) (OligoLys). PEG-OligoLys selectively attached to liver sinusoids for PEG coating, leaving the endothelium of other tissues uncoated and, thus, accessible to the nanomedicines. Furthermore, OligoLys having a two-armed PEG configuration was ultimately cleared from sinusoidal walls to the bile, while OligoLys with linear PEG persisted in the sinusoidal walls, possibly causing prolonged disturbance of liver physiological functions. Such transient and selective stealth coating of liver sinusoids by two-arm-PEG-OligoLys was effective in preventing the sinusoidal clearance of nonviral and viral gene vectors, representatives of synthetic and nature-derived nanomedicines, respectively, thereby boosting their gene transfection efficiency in the target tissues."

                "text": "\nSurface modification with targeting ligands represents a powerful strategy to overcome the inherent liver tropism of LNPs and enable cell-specific delivery within the liver or to extrahepatic tissues. The addition of ligands to the LNP surface provides a mechanism for receptor-mediated endocytosis in specific cell populations, allowing researchers to bypass the default ApoE-dependent pathways that predominantly direct LNPs to hepatocytes <Paper corpusId=\"268998096\" paperTitle=\"(Rodriguez-Castejon et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"47397011\" paperTitle=\"(Akinc et al., 2010)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nFor targeted delivery within the liver, researchers have developed approaches to selectively deliver LNPs to specific cell populations. One notable strategy involves conjugating mannose to the surface of highly PEGylated LNPs to achieve selective delivery to liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). Kim et al. demonstrated that mannose-conjugated LNPs could effectively target LSECs through the mannose receptor, which is predominantly expressed on these cells, while minimizing unwanted uptake by hepatocytes <Paper corpusId=\"232059366\" paperTitle=\"(Kim et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"250244349\" paperTitle=\"(Albertsen et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. This approach combines physical property modifications (high PEG content to increase size) with surface ligand conjugation to achieve cell-specific targeting within the liver.\n\nFor Kupffer cell targeting, increasing LNP size and modifying the surface with hydrophobic molecules has proven effective <Paper corpusId=\"272838041\" paperTitle=\"(Liu et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"212114474\" paperTitle=\"(Colino et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. Paunovska et al. discovered that LNPs formulated with oxidized cholesterol could efficiently deliver mRNA to cells in the liver microenvironment, including Kupffer cells and liver endothelial cells, without requiring additional targeting ligands. Their work revealed that the position of the oxidative modification on cholesterol significantly impacts targeting efficiency, with modifications on the hydrocarbon tail associated with sterol ring D outperforming those on sterol ring B <Paper corpusId=\"272838041\" paperTitle=\"(Liu et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"73435998\" paperTitle=\"(Paunovska et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nTo overcome the challenge of liver accumulation for extrahepatic targeting, researchers have developed several ligand-based approaches. While simply increasing PEG-lipid content has not been successful in achieving prolonged circulation and redirection to extrahepatic targets, conjugating targeting ligands to the LNP surface has shown promise <Paper corpusId=\"253795111\" paperTitle=\"(Kalita et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. For example, LNPs conjugated with antibodies against vascular cell adhesion molecules (VCAM-1 or PECAM-1) and CD-4 have successfully redirected LNPs from the liver to the lung, cerebral endothelium, and T cells in both lymph and spleen <Paper corpusId=\"253795111\" paperTitle=\"(Kalita et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nA groundbreaking approach for extrahepatic targeting is the selective organ targeting (SORT) methodology. This technique involves incorporating specific SORT molecules, such as charge-based lipids, into LNPs to tune delivery to extrahepatic tissues following intravenous administration <Paper corpusId=\"268998096\" paperTitle=\"(Rodriguez-Castejon et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. The mechanism underlying SORT technology appears to involve an \"endogenous targeting\" process where: 1) PEG-lipids desorb from the LNP surface, 2) distinct proteins bind to the exposed SORT molecules, and 3) these surface-bound proteins interact with cognate receptors highly expressed in specific tissues <Paper corpusId=\"268998096\" paperTitle=\"(Rodriguez-Castejon et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"245405261\" paperTitle=\"(Dilliard et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. This innovative approach represents a significant advancement in developing systems targeting extrahepatic organs while maintaining the recognized efficacy of LNP delivery.\n\nTogether, these surface modification strategies provide researchers with a diverse toolkit for directing LNPs to specific cell populations within the liver or redirecting them to extrahepatic tissues, expanding the therapeutic potential of LNP-delivered RNA therapeutics beyond hepatocyte-targeted applications.",

                            "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have proven to be highly efficient carriers of short-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to hepatocytes in vivo; however, the precise mechanism by which this efficient delivery occurs has yet to be elucidated. We found that apolipoprotein E (apoE), which plays a major role in the clearance and hepatocellular uptake of physiological lipoproteins, also acts as an endogenous targeting ligand for ionizable LNPs (iLNPs), but not cationic LNPs (cLNPs). The role of apoE was investigated using both in vitro studies employing recombinant apoE and in vivo studies in wild-type and apoE-/- mice. Receptor dependence was explored in vitro and in vivo using low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR-/-)-deficient mice. As an alternative to endogenous apoE-based targeting, we developed a targeting approach using an exogenous ligand containing a multivalent N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)-cluster, which binds with high affinity to the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) expressed on hepatocytes. Both apoE-based endogenous and GalNAc-based exogenous targeting appear to be highly effective strategies for the delivery of iLNPs to liver."

                            "Hepatic macrophage populations include different types of cells with plastic properties that can differentiate into diverse phenotypes to modulate their properties in response to different stimuli. They often regulate the activity of other cells and play an important role in many hepatic diseases. In response to those pathological situations, they are activated, releasing cytokines and chemokines; they may attract circulating monocytes and exert functions that can aggravate the symptoms or drive reparation processes. As a result, liver macrophages are potential therapeutic targets that can be oriented toward a variety of aims, with emergent nanotechnology platforms potentially offering new perspectives for macrophage vectorization. Macrophages play an essential role in the final destination of nanoparticles (NPs) in the organism, as they are involved in their uptake and trafficking in vivo. Different types of delivery nanosystems for macrophage recognition and targeting, such as liposomes, solid-lipid, polymeric, or metallic nanoparticles, have been developed. Passive targeting promotes the accumulation of the NPs in the liver due to their anatomical and physiological features. This process is modulated by NP characteristics such as size, charge, and surface modifications. Active targeting approaches with specific ligands may also be used to reach liver macrophages. In order to design new systems, the NP recognition mechanism of macrophages must be understood, taking into account that variations in local microenvironment may change the phenotype of macrophages in a way that will affect the uptake and toxicity of NPs. This kind of information may be applied to diseases where macrophages play a pathogenic role, such as metabolic disorders, infections, or cancer. The kinetics of nanoparticles strongly affects their therapeutic efficacy when administered in vivo. Release kinetics could predict the behavior of nanosystems targeting macrophages and be applied to improve their characteristics. PBPK models have been developed to characterize nanoparticle biodistribution in organs of the reticuloendothelial system (RES) such as liver or spleen. Another controversial issue is the possible toxicity of non-degradable nanoparticles, which in many cases accumulate in high percentages in macrophage clearance organs such as the liver, spleen, and kidney."

                            "Using mRNA to produce therapeutic proteins is a promising approach to treat genetic diseases. However, systemically delivering mRNA to cell types besides hepatocytes remains challenging. Fast identification of nanoparticle delivery (FIND) is a DNA barcode\u2010based system designed to measure how over 100 lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) deliver mRNA that functions in the cytoplasm of target cells in a single mouse. By using FIND to quantify how 75 chemically distinct LNPs delivered mRNA to 28 cell types in vivo, it is found that an LNP formulated with oxidized cholesterol and no targeting ligand delivers Cre mRNA, which edits DNA in hepatic endothelial cells and Kupffer cells at 0.05 mg kg\u22121. Notably, the LNP targets liver microenvironmental cells fivefold more potently than hepatocytes. The structure of the oxidized cholesterols added to the LNP is systematically varied to show that the position of the oxidative modification may be important; cholesterols modified on the hydrocarbon tail associated with sterol ring D tend to outperform cholesterols modified on sterol ring B. These data suggest that LNPs formulated with modified cholesterols can deliver gene\u2010editing mRNA to the liver microenvironment at clinically relevant doses."

                            "Significance Liver accumulation represents a significant barrier in the development of therapeutically efficacious nanoparticle drug delivery systems. Using a series of lipid nanoparticles with distinct organ-targeting properties, we provide evidence for a plausible mechanism of action for nanoparticle delivery to non-liver tissues. Following intravenous injection, specific proteins in the blood are recruited to the nanoparticle\u2019s surface based on its molecular composition and they endow it with a unique biological identity that governs its ultimate fate in the body. An innovative paradigm emerges from this mechanistic understanding of nanoparticle delivery\u2014endogenous targeting\u2014wherein the molecular composition of a nanoparticle is rationally engineered to interact with specific proteins in the blood to overcome liver accumulation and to target specific organs. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a clinically mature technology for the delivery of genetic medicines but have limited therapeutic applications due to liver accumulation. Recently, our laboratory developed selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles that expand the therapeutic applications of genetic medicines by enabling delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) and gene editing systems to non-liver tissues. SORT nanoparticles include a supplemental SORT molecule whose chemical structure determines the LNP\u2019s tissue-specific activity. To understand how SORT nanoparticles surpass the delivery barrier of liver hepatocyte accumulation, we studied the mechanistic factors which define their organ-targeting properties. We discovered that the chemical nature of the added SORT molecule controlled biodistribution, global/apparent pKa, and serum protein interactions of SORT nanoparticles. Additionally, we provide evidence for an endogenous targeting mechanism whereby organ targeting occurs via 1) desorption of poly(ethylene glycol) lipids from the LNP surface, 2) binding of distinct proteins to the nanoparticle surface because of recognition of exposed SORT molecules, and 3) subsequent interactions between surface-bound proteins and cognate receptors highly expressed in specific tissues. These findings establish a crucial link between the molecular composition of SORT nanoparticles and their unique and precise organ-targeting properties and suggest that the recruitment of specific proteins to a nanoparticle\u2019s surface can enable drug delivery beyond the liver."

Unlike conventional PEGylation strategies applied directly to LNPs, this method selectively attaches to liver sinusoids, creating a temporary PEG coating that prevents nonspecific clearance by the liver sinusoidal endothelium while leaving other tissues accessible to nanomedicines <Paper corpusId=\"220110543\" paperTitle=\"(Dirisala et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. Importantly, the two-armed PEG configuration is ultimately cleared from sinusoidal walls to the bile, avoiding prolonged disruption of liver physiological functions <Paper corpusId=\"272261048\" paperTitle=\"(Dinh et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. This transient and selective stealth coating strategy has proven effective in preventing sinusoidal clearance of both nonviral and viral gene vectors, dramatically decreasing liver accumulation and boosting gene transfection efficiency in target tissues <Paper corpusId=\"220110543\" paperTitle=\"(Dirisala et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nAdditional approaches to minimize liver sequestration include the saturation or depletion of Kupffer cells using non-toxic materials to temporarily reduce their phagocytic capacity <Paper corpusId=\"276413641\" paperTitle=\"(Hosseini-Kharat et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>. These strategies can be particularly valuable when targeting extrahepatic tissues, as they enhance nanoparticle circulation to target tissues without requiring complex modifications to the LNP formulation itself.\n\nThe RES-blockade approaches complement other strategies such as size optimization and surface modification with targeting ligands. For instance, when combined with approaches that tune LNP size to either bypass liver fenestrations (50-300 nm) or target specific liver cell populations, these pre-treatment strategies can further enhance the specificity and efficacy of RNA therapeutics <Paper corpusId=\"250244349\" paperTitle=\"(Albertsen et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.

To successfully administer nucleic acids, one approach is to encapsulate them in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs).

Here, we administer prior to the LNPs a liposome designed to transiently occupy liver cells, the Nanoprimer. This study demonstrates that the pretreatment of mice with the Nanoprimer decreases the LNPs' uptake by the RES. By accumulating rapidly in the liver cells, the Nanoprimer improves the bioavailability of the LNPs encapsulating human erythropoietin (hEPO) mRNA or factor VII (FVII) siRNA, leading respectively to more hEPO production (by 32%) or FVII silencing (by 49%).

Conjugation of targeting ligands on the LNPs surface proved to be effective in facilitating the uptake by specific organs in small-scale settings. For instance, conjugated antibodies targeted against vascular cell adhesion molecules VCAM-1 or PECAM-1 and CD-4 were employed to redistribute the LNPs from liver to lung, cerebral endothelium during brain oedema and in all T cells (na\u00efve, memory, central, and effector) in both lymph and spleen, respectively (Tomb\u00e1cz et al., 2021)",

A major critical issue in systemically administered nanomedicines is nonspecific clearance by the liver sinusoidal endothelium, causing a substantial decrease in the delivery efficiency of nanomedicines into the target tissues. Here, we addressed this issue by in situ stealth coating of liver sinusoids using linear or two-armed poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)\u2013conjugated oligo(l-lysine) (OligoLys). PEG-OligoLys selectively attached to liver sinusoids for PEG coating, leaving the endothelium of other tissues uncoated and, thus, accessible to the nanomedicines. Furthermore, OligoLys having a two-armed PEG configuration was ultimately cleared from sinusoidal walls to the bile, while OligoLys with linear PEG persisted in the sinusoidal walls, possibly causing prolonged disturbance of liver physiological functions. Such transient and selective stealth coating of liver sinusoids by two-arm-PEG-OligoLys was effective in preventing the sinusoidal clearance of nonviral and viral gene vectors, representatives of synthetic and nature-derived nanomedicines, respectively, thereby boosting their gene transfection efficiency in the target tissues."

                "text": "\nBeyond surface modifications with targeting ligands, researchers have developed alternative formulation approaches that modify the core lipid components of LNPs to alter their biodistribution. These approaches leverage the understanding that small changes in LNP composition can dramatically impact cellular targeting within and beyond the liver.\n\nOne promising approach involves modifying the cholesterol component of LNPs. Paunovska et al. discovered that LNPs containing oxidized cholesterol can efficiently deliver mRNA to cells in the liver microenvironment, including Kupffer cells and liver endothelial cells, without requiring additional targeting ligands <Paper corpusId=\"272838041\" paperTitle=\"(Liu et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"73435998\" paperTitle=\"(Paunovska et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>.

This approach demonstrates how subtle modifications to core lipid components can redirect LNPs from hepatocytes to other liver cell populations.\n\nFor targeting Kupffer cells specifically, researchers have explored increasing LNP size and incorporating hydrophobic molecules into the LNP formulation <Paper corpusId=\"272838041\" paperTitle=\"(Liu et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"212114474\" paperTitle=\"(Colino et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. These modifications enhance macrophage recognition and uptake through mechanisms distinct from the ApoE-mediated pathways that dominate hepatocyte targeting.\n\nA more radical approach involves complete cholesterol removal from LNP formulations. Recent research suggests that cholesterol removal can effectively prevent hepatic accumulation by reducing lipoprotein adsorption, addressing one of the persistent challenges in nanomedicine <Paper corpusId=\"271855450\" paperTitle=\"(Liu et al._1, 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. This represents a paradigm shift in LNP design, challenging the conventional wisdom that cholesterol is essential for effective LNP formulations.\n\nPerhaps the most innovative formulation approach is the selective organ targeting (SORT) methodology. This technique involves incorporating specific SORT molecules, such as charge-based lipids, into LNPs to tune delivery to extrahepatic tissues following intravenous administration <Paper corpusId=\"268998096\" paperTitle=\"(Rodriguez-Castejon et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"245405261\" paperTitle=\"(Dilliard et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. The mechanism appears to involve an \"endogenous targeting\" process where: 1) PEG-lipids desorb from the LNP surface, 2) distinct proteins bind to the exposed SORT molecules, and 3) these surface-bound proteins interact with cognate receptors highly expressed in specific tissues <Paper corpusId=\"268998096\" paperTitle=\"(Rodriguez-Castejon et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"245405261\" paperTitle=\"(Dilliard et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. This strategy represents a significant advancement in developing systems targeting extrahepatic organs while maintaining the recognized efficacy of LNP delivery.\n\nFor specifically targeting the reticuloendothelial system (RES) within the liver, Pattipeiluhu et al. demonstrated that simply changing a single lipid component within the Onpattro formulation to switch the LNP surface charge from neutral to anionic significantly enhances mRNA expression within hepatic RES cell types <Paper corpusId=\"247129065\" paperTitle=\"(Pattipeiluhu et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. This approach was validated in both zebrafish and mouse models, highlighting how minor formulation changes can dramatically redirect LNP tropism within the liver.\n\nThese alternative formulation approaches provide researchers with powerful tools to control LNP biodistribution without requiring complex conjugation chemistry or pre-treatment strategies. By making strategic modifications to core lipid components, researchers can fine-tune LNP targeting to specific cell populations both within and beyond the liver.",

However, systemically delivering mRNA to cell types besides hepatocytes remains challenging. Fast identification of nanoparticle delivery (FIND) is a DNA barcode\u2010based system designed to measure how over 100 lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) deliver mRNA that functions in the cytoplasm of target cells in a single mouse. By using FIND to quantify how 75 chemically distinct LNPs delivered mRNA to 28 cell types in vivo, it is found that an LNP formulated with oxidized cholesterol and no targeting ligand delivers Cre mRNA, which edits DNA in hepatic endothelial cells and Kupffer cells at 0.05 mg kg\u22121. Notably, the LNP targets liver microenvironmental cells fivefold more potently than hepatocytes. The structure of the oxidized cholesterols added to the LNP is systematically varied to show that the position of the oxidative modification may be important; cholesterols modified on the hydrocarbon tail associated with sterol ring D tend to outperform cholesterols modified on sterol ring B. These data suggest that LNPs formulated with modified cholesterols can deliver gene\u2010editing mRNA to the liver microenvironment at clinically relevant doses."

                            "Hepatic macrophage populations include different types of cells with plastic properties that can differentiate into diverse phenotypes to modulate their properties in response to different stimuli. They often regulate the activity of other cells and play an important role in many hepatic diseases. In response to those pathological situations, they are activated, releasing cytokines and chemokines; they may attract circulating monocytes and exert functions that can aggravate the symptoms or drive reparation processes. As a result, liver macrophages are potential therapeutic targets that can be oriented toward a variety of aims, with emergent nanotechnology platforms potentially offering new perspectives for macrophage vectorization. Macrophages play an essential role in the final destination of nanoparticles (NPs) in the organism, as they are involved in their uptake and trafficking in vivo. Different types of delivery nanosystems for macrophage recognition and targeting, such as liposomes, solid-lipid, polymeric, or metallic nanoparticles, have been developed. Passive targeting promotes the accumulation of the NPs in the liver due to their anatomical and physiological features. This process is modulated by NP characteristics such as size, charge, and surface modifications. Active targeting approaches with specific ligands may also be used to reach liver macrophages. In order to design new systems, the NP recognition mechanism of macrophages must be understood, taking into account that variations in local microenvironment may change the phenotype of macrophages in a way that will affect the uptake and toxicity of NPs. This kind of information may be applied to diseases where macrophages play a pathogenic role, such as metabolic disorders, infections, or cancer. The kinetics of nanoparticles strongly affects their therapeutic efficacy when administered in vivo. Release kinetics could predict the behavior of nanosystems targeting macrophages and be applied to improve their characteristics. PBPK models have been developed to characterize nanoparticle biodistribution in organs of the reticuloendothelial system (RES) such as liver or spleen. Another controversial issue is the possible toxicity of non-degradable nanoparticles, which in many cases accumulate in high percentages in macrophage clearance organs such as the liver, spleen, and kidney."

                            "Significance Liver accumulation represents a significant barrier in the development of therapeutically efficacious nanoparticle drug delivery systems. Using a series of lipid nanoparticles with distinct organ-targeting properties, we provide evidence for a plausible mechanism of action for nanoparticle delivery to non-liver tissues. Following intravenous injection, specific proteins in the blood are recruited to the nanoparticle\u2019s surface based on its molecular composition and they endow it with a unique biological identity that governs its ultimate fate in the body. An innovative paradigm emerges from this mechanistic understanding of nanoparticle delivery\u2014endogenous targeting\u2014wherein the molecular composition of a nanoparticle is rationally engineered to interact with specific proteins in the blood to overcome liver accumulation and to target specific organs. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a clinically mature technology for the delivery of genetic medicines but have limited therapeutic applications due to liver accumulation. Recently, our laboratory developed selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles that expand the therapeutic applications of genetic medicines by enabling delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) and gene editing systems to non-liver tissues. SORT nanoparticles include a supplemental SORT molecule whose chemical structure determines the LNP\u2019s tissue-specific activity. To understand how SORT nanoparticles surpass the delivery barrier of liver hepatocyte accumulation, we studied the mechanistic factors which define their organ-targeting properties. We discovered that the chemical nature of the added SORT molecule controlled biodistribution, global/apparent pKa, and serum protein interactions of SORT nanoparticles. Additionally, we provide evidence for an endogenous targeting mechanism whereby organ targeting occurs via 1) desorption of poly(ethylene glycol) lipids from the LNP surface, 2) binding of distinct proteins to the nanoparticle surface because of recognition of exposed SORT molecules, and 3) subsequent interactions between surface-bound proteins and cognate receptors highly expressed in specific tissues. These findings establish a crucial link between the molecular composition of SORT nanoparticles and their unique and precise organ-targeting properties and suggest that the recruitment of specific proteins to a nanoparticle\u2019s surface can enable drug delivery beyond the liver."

These approaches include incorporating microRNA binding sites into mRNA untranslated regions to selectively suppress expression in the liver while maintaining therapeutic activity in target tissues.

                "text": "\nWhile most approaches to redirect LNP distribution focus on modifying the nanoparticle itself, genetic and RNA modification strategies represent an innovative alternative by engineering the therapeutic cargo rather than the delivery vehicle. These approaches enable tissue-specific expression patterns even when the LNP predominantly accumulates in the liver.\n\nA particularly promising RNA modification strategy involves the incorporation of hepatic-selective, suppressive microRNA (miRNA) binding sites into the untranslated regions of therapeutic mRNA <Paper corpusId=\"250972048\" paperTitle=\"(Kularatne et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. This clever approach exploits the fact that certain miRNAs are highly expressed in specific tissues, including the liver. By incorporating binding sites for liver-enriched miRNAs into the therapeutic mRNA, expression can be selectively suppressed in hepatocytes while remaining active in target tissues where those miRNAs are absent or less abundant. This strategy effectively uses the liver's own regulatory mechanisms to prevent off-target expression while maintaining therapeutic efficacy in the intended tissues.\n\nThis RNA modification approach complements other strategies such as nanoprimer pre-treatment, which physically blocks LNP uptake by reticuloendothelial cells. For instance, research has demonstrated that using liposomal nanoprimers to saturate Kupffer cell-mediated clearance prior to LNP administration results in increased systemic availability of therapeutic RNA and enhanced expression of human erythropoietin mRNA or improved silencing with factor VII siRNA <Paper corpusId=\"250972048\" paperTitle=\"(Kularatne et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"218480033\" paperTitle=\"(Saunders et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. When combined with miRNA-binding site modifications, these approaches could potentially provide synergistic benefits by both reducing physical accumulation in the liver and suppressing expression in any LNPs that do reach hepatocytes.\n\nUnlike strategies that modify the LNP structure or composition, RNA modification approaches offer the advantage of maintaining the established safety and efficacy profiles of clinically validated LNP formulations while introducing tissue specificity at the genetic level. This represents a valuable addition to the toolkit for controlling the biodistribution and expression patterns of LNP-delivered RNA therapeutics.",

                            "Alternatives to LNP modification have also been attempted to prevent liver accumulation. In one example, a liposome termed a \"nanoprimer\" was used to saturate Kupffer cell-mediated clearance 10 min prior to administration of LNP containing Cy5.5 labeled human erythropoietin mRNA or factor VII siRNA, resulting in increased systemic fluorescence at 1 h post-dose and increased erythropoietin or decreased factor VII protein expression at 48 h post-dose, respectively (Saunders et al., 2020). Clever mRNA modifications have also been made in an attempt to reduce off-target liver expression by the design of hepatic-selective, suppressive micro-RNA (miRNA) binding sites into the untranslated regions of the mRNA [35]."

To successfully administer nucleic acids, one approach is to encapsulate them in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). However, LNPs administered intravenously substantially accumulate in the liver where they are taken up by the reticuloendothelial system (RES). Here, we administer prior to the LNPs a liposome designed to transiently occupy liver cells, the Nanoprimer. This study demonstrates that the pretreatment of mice with the Nanoprimer decreases the LNPs' uptake by the RES. By accumulating rapidly in the liver cells, the Nanoprimer improves the bioavailability of the LNPs encapsulating human erythropoietin (hEPO) mRNA or factor VII (FVII) siRNA, leading respectively to more hEPO production (by 32%) or FVII silencing (by 49%). The use of the Nanoprimer offers a new strategy to improve the systemic delivery of RNA-based therapeutics."
