            "abstract": "Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has raised a growing interest in phage display research. Sequencing depth is a pivotal parameter for using NGS. In the current study, we made a side-by-side comparison of two NGS platforms with different sequencing depths, denoted as lower-throughput (LTP) and higher-throughput (HTP). The capacity of these platforms for characterization of the composition, quality, and diversity of the unselected Ph.D.TM-12 Phage Display Peptide Library was investigated. Our results indicated that HTP sequencing detects a considerably higher number of unique sequences compared to the LTP platform, thus covering a broader diversity of the library. We found a larger percentage of singletons, a smaller percentage of repeated sequences, and a greater percentage of distinct sequences in the LTP datasets. These parameters suggest a higher library quality, resulting in potentially misleading information when using LTP sequencing for such assessment. Our observations showed that HTP reveals a broader distribution of peptide frequencies, thus revealing increased heterogeneity of the library by the HTP approach and offering a comparatively higher capacity for distinguishing peptides from each other. Our analyses suggested that LTP and HTP datasets show discrepancies in their peptide composition and position-specific distribution of amino acids within the library. Taken together, these findings lead us to the conclusion that a higher sequencing depth can yield more in-depth insights into the composition of the library and provide a more complete picture of the quality and diversity of phage display peptide libraries.",

                    "text": "Phage display, introduced in 1985 by George Smith [1], has been used extensively in the identification of novel ligands with potential applications in different research areas including, but not limited to, drug discovery [2], drug delivery [3], and molecular imaging [4]. In recent decades, combinatorial phage display libraries have raised growing attention for the translation of peptide-based diagnostics and therapeutics into the clinic. These libraries are constructed by in-frame cloning of random oligonucleotides into the surface protein gene of a bacteriophage, leading to the expression of a vast number of exogenous peptides as fusions to the corresponding surface protein. This links the phenotype to the genotype, allowing for sequencing of the relevant part of the phage genome to retrieve the displayed peptide sequence [5]. \n\nThe advent of phage display peptide libraries has enabled the high-throughput screening on a variety of important cellular and molecular targets [6][7][8][9][10]. Random peptide sequences expressed on the phage surface can interact with the target of interest and phages expressing peptides that bind specifically to the target can be isolated. Phage display screening, called biopanning, consists of iterative rounds in which the library is presented to the target of interest, and the selected phage pool is amplified by infection of Escherichia coli cells. The amplified phages serve as input for the subsequent round of biopanning [11]. Traditionally, biopanning outputs have been analyzed by Sanger sequencing. This sequencing approach can identify only a limited number of peptides in the library. Recent advances have combined phage display with next-generation sequencing (NGS), allowing for the sequencing of thousands to millions of peptide inserts in parallel [12][13][14]. This eliminates the laborious procedure of picking random clones and provides increased resolution of the biopanning output compared to Sanger sequencing. NGS allows researchers to analyze the composition of large peptide libraries on a deeper scale.",

Sequencing depth is a pivotal parameter for using NGS. In the current study, we made a side-by-side comparison of two NGS platforms with different sequencing depths, denoted as lower-throughput (LTP) and higher-throughput (HTP). The capacity of these platforms for characterization of the composition, quality, and diversity of the unselected Ph.D.TM-12 Phage Display Peptide Library was investigated. Our results indicated that HTP sequencing detects a considerably higher number of unique sequences compared to the LTP platform, thus covering a broader diversity of the library. We found a larger percentage of singletons, a smaller percentage of repeated sequences, and a greater percentage of distinct sequences in the LTP datasets. These parameters suggest a higher library quality, resulting in potentially misleading information when using LTP sequencing for such assessment. Our observations showed that HTP reveals a broader distribution of peptide frequencies, thus revealing increased heterogeneity of the library by the HTP approach and offering a comparatively higher capacity for distinguishing peptides from each other. Our analyses suggested that LTP and HTP datasets show discrepancies in their peptide composition and position-specific distribution of amino acids within the library. Taken together, these findings lead us to the conclusion that a higher sequencing depth can yield more in-depth insights into the composition of the library and provide a more complete picture of the quality and diversity of phage display peptide libraries.\n## Introduction\nPhage display, introduced in 1985 by George Smith [1], has been used extensively in the identification of novel ligands with potential applications in different research areas including, but not limited to, drug discovery [2], drug delivery [3], and molecular imaging [4]. In recent decades, combinatorial phage display libraries have raised growing attention for the translation of peptide-based diagnostics and therapeutics into the clinic. These libraries are constructed by in-frame cloning of random oligonucleotides into the surface protein gene of a bacteriophage, leading to the expression of a vast number of exogenous peptides as fusions to the corresponding surface protein. This links the phenotype to the genotype, allowing for sequencing of the relevant part of the phage genome to retrieve the displayed peptide sequence [5]. \n\nThe advent of phage display peptide libraries has enabled the high-throughput screening on a variety of important cellular and molecular targets [6][7][8][9][10]. Random peptide sequences expressed on the phage surface can interact with the target of interest and phages expressing peptides that bind specifically to the target can be isolated. Phage display screening, called biopanning, consists of iterative rounds in which the library is presented to the target of interest, and the selected phage pool is amplified by infection of Escherichia coli cells. The amplified phages serve as input for the subsequent round of biopanning [11]. Traditionally, biopanning outputs have been analyzed by Sanger sequencing. This sequencing approach can identify only a limited number of peptides in the library. Recent advances have combined phage display with next-generation sequencing (NGS), allowing for the sequencing of thousands to millions of peptide inserts in parallel [12][13][14]. This eliminates the laborious procedure of picking random clones and provides increased resolution of the biopanning output compared to Sanger sequencing. NGS allows researchers to analyze the composition of large peptide libraries on a deeper scale.\n\n## Discussion\nPeptide phage display relies on the identification of genuine target binders in the recovered phages obtained from biopanning. Analysis of the exact composition of phage display peptide libraries plays a valuable role in the discovery of ligands with strong binding affinities to different biological targets [21]. To achieve this purpose, a sequencing platform capable of rigorous characterization of the composition and diversity of the peptide pool is crucial. High-throughput sequencing has been found to be suited for the analysis of the sequence composition and inherent diversity of phage display libraries [20,31]. In the current work, we made a side-by-side comparison of the capacity of two NGS platforms with different depths of sequencing in characterizing the composition and diversity of a phage display peptide library.

            "abstract": "Phage display technology has been widely used for antibody affinity maturation for decades. The limited library sequence diversity together with excessive redundancy and labour-consuming procedure for candidate identification are two major obstacles to widespread adoption of this technology. We hereby describe a novel library generation and screening approach to address the problems. The approach started with the targeted diversification of multiple complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of a humanized anti-ErbB2 antibody, HuA21, with a small perturbation mutagenesis strategy. A combination of three degenerate codons, NWG, NWC, and NSG, were chosen for amino acid saturation mutagenesis without introducing cysteine and stop residues. In total, 7,749 degenerate oligonucleotides were synthesized on two microchips and released to construct five single-chain antibody fragment (scFv) gene libraries with 4 x 106 DNA sequences. Deep sequencing of the unselected and selected phage libraries using the Illumina platform allowed for an in-depth evaluation of the enrichment landscapes in CDR sequences and amino acid substitutions. Potent candidates were identified according to their high frequencies using NGS analysis, by-passing the need for the primary screening of target-binding clones.

                    "text": "Many studies are continually developing methods to overcome these limitations and for high-throughput screening of display libraries. The link between the genotype (scFv coding sequence) and the phenotype (surface-displayed scFv) is the principle for the implementation of sequencing-guided screening of display libraries. Next-generation sequencing allows high-throughput interrogation of the selection steps to evaluate the relative enrichment of scFvs as indicative of their affinity for the target of interest, giving a far greater coverage compared to classical ELISA screening. This coverage also allows the identification of rare clones that, in some cases, can target sub-dominant epitopes with intriguing properties. Beyond the enrichment, high-throughput sequencing allows to discard a priori all those clones bearing non-valid inserts to restrict the analysis to potential binders. To further improve the confidence of binding prediction, we are implementing a database collecting predicted and validated binders to target-unrelated components of the biopanning. Refining the sequencing-guided screening, by applying these informatic scripts, grants dedicated wet step efforts to those scFvs with high-potential to be specific binders. Moreover, the characterization of these false-positive clones' sequences (target-unrelated and selection-unrelated), could lead to an increased understanding of how these clones arise to intervene in crucial selection steps for preventing or limiting this phenomenon. Although next-generation sequencing improved the quality of phage display, there are at least two key limitations: (1) the maximal read length of second-generation sequencing technologies (i.e., Illumina) allows to sequence only a portion of scFvs (e.g., VH), making the reconstruction of the entire antibody fragment challenging; (2) to physically fish out in silico-identified clones of interest, a laborious recovery step is necessary. Long reads obtainable from third-generation sequencing allow achieving quali-quantitative information of the entire scFvs. Not long ago, the relatively low-throughput, the high error rate, and the cost limited the exploitation of third-generation sequencing in display technologies. The circular consensus reads that the more widespread platforms' availability is making this paradigm shift overcome challenges with the higher sequencing error rate, and also leads to a reduction in sequencing costs [65].",

                    "text": "Beyond the scFv format, different layouts of antibody fragments have also been used to construct phage display libraries, including the antigen-binding fragment (Fab) or the single domain antibody (sdAb) [29][30][31][32]. Antibody libraries are surveyed by several affinity selection and screening cycles, each one consisting of (1) incubation of the phage repertoire with the target of interest (biopanning); (2) intensive washes; (3) elution; (4) amplification step in E. coli; and 5) extensive ELISA assays to identify specific binders. The molecular baits used in biopanning are usually recombinant proteins or target-expressing cells. Subtractive selection cycles are commonly included in the screening to remove clones recognizing non-target related molecules, i.e., the Fc fragment for Fc-tagged recombinant proteins, or cells not expressing the target of interest (Figure 1) [33]. Phage selection was also developed in vivo by performing selection cycles in living animals; this strategy is properly applied when the target of interest is modified upon in vitro modeling [34,35]. \n\nAdalimumab was the first human monoclonal antibody, isolated by phage display with a \"guided selection\", to be approved for clinical applications in 2002 [36]. This notwithstanding, the phage antibody library selection and screening process is slow, expensive, and often limited by the number of clones that can be tested by binding assays, thus representing a bottleneck to expand the use of mAbs. Emerging technologies are resizing this hurdle, paving the way to an expanded use of this approach. \n\nTo this end, a very significant milestone in antibody discovery by phage display was the application of next-generation sequencing (NGS) to the screening procedure. The application of NGS in place of standard screening methods, requiring intensive use of ELISA (or other binding assays), has dramatically increased the throughput and decreased the working time of the phage antibody library discovery platform.",

Based on this concept, NGS was adopted for the screening of antibody libraries to identify potential binders by monitoring the enrichment of a given sequence during the selection cycles [55]. Parallel comparative screenings of antibody libraries by traditional ELISA and NGS have demonstrated that, beyond top-ranking clones efficiently identified by both technologies, deep sequencing enables the discovery of many more specific binders among rare clones with potentially interesting features [38,56]. \n\nELISA and NGS have demonstrated that, beyond top-ranking clones efficiently identified by both technologies, deep sequencing enables the discovery of many more specific binders among rare clones with potentially interesting features [38,56]. Strategies to analyze phage library by second-and third-generation sequencing. On the left, the workflow for extraction of variable fragments compatible with second-generation sequencing platforms (e.g., Illumina MiSeq) is shown. Full-length scFvs and VH fragments are extracted from dsDNA of phages from E. coli. On the right, the workflow for the application of third-generation sequencing of entire scFvs by circular consensus sequencing is represented. Molecular barcoding can be included in both strategies for multiplexing samples. The indicated pros (green font) and cons (red font) are referred to as the current state-of-the-art.",

Sasso\n## Abstract\nSimple Summary Monoclonal antibodies are increasingly used for a broad range of diseases. Rising demand must face with time time-consuming and laborious processes to isolate novel monoclonal antibodies. Next-generation sequencing coupled to phage display provides timely and sustainable high throughput selection strategy to rapidly access novel target. Here, we describe the current NGS-guided strategies to identify potential binders from enriched sub-libraires by applying a user-friendly informatic pipeline to identify and discard false positive clones. Rescue step and strategies to boost mAb yield are also discussed to improve the limiting selection and screening steps. Abstract Monoclonal antibodies are among the most powerful therapeutics in modern medicine. Since the approval of the first therapeutic antibody in 1986, monoclonal antibodies keep holding great expectations for application in a range of clinical indications, highlighting the need to provide timely and sustainable access to powerful screening options. However, their application in the past has been limited by time-consuming and expensive steps of discovery and production. The screening of antibody repertoires is a laborious step; however, the implementation of next-generation sequencing-guided screening of single-chain antibody fragments has now largely overcome this issue. This review provides a detailed overview of the current strategies for the identification of monoclonal antibodies from phage display-based libraries. We also discuss the challenges and the possible solutions to improve the limiting selection and screening steps, in order to keep pace with the increasing demand for monoclonal antibodies.\n## Introduction\nBeyond the scFv format, different layouts of antibody fragments have also been used to construct phage display libraries, including the antigen-binding fragment (Fab) or the single domain antibody (sdAb) [29][30][31][32]. Antibody libraries are surveyed by several affinity selection and screening cycles, each one consisting of (1) incubation of the phage repertoire with the target of interest (biopanning); (2) intensive washes; (3) elution; (4) amplification step in E. coli; and 5) extensive ELISA assays to identify specific binders. The molecular baits used in biopanning are usually recombinant proteins or target-expressing cells. Subtractive selection cycles are commonly included in the screening to remove clones recognizing non-target related molecules, i.e., the Fc fragment for Fc-tagged recombinant proteins, or cells not expressing the target of interest (Figure 1) [33]. Phage selection was also developed in vivo by performing selection cycles in living animals; this strategy is properly applied when the target of interest is modified upon in vitro modeling [34,35]. \n\nAdalimumab was the first human monoclonal antibody, isolated by phage display with a \"guided selection\", to be approved for clinical applications in 2002 [36]. This notwithstanding, the phage antibody library selection and screening process is slow, expensive, and often limited by the number of clones that can be tested by binding assays, thus representing a bottleneck to expand the use of mAbs. Emerging technologies are resizing this hurdle, paving the way to an expanded use of this approach. \n\nTo this end, a very significant milestone in antibody discovery by phage display was the application of next-generation sequencing (NGS) to the screening procedure. The application of NGS in place of standard screening methods, requiring intensive use of ELISA (or other binding assays), has dramatically increased the throughput and decreased the working time of the phage antibody library discovery platform.\n\n## Implementation of Next Generation Sequencing to Phage Display scFv Library Screening\nIn addition, clone enrichment can also reflect features not necessarily related to target affinity, including biological fitness and binding to non-target substrates (discussed in the next sections) reducing the isolation of true binders [52]. \n\nThe application of NGS to antibody display technologies (such as phage display, E. coli display, yeast display, ribosome display) allows us to deeply characterize the library composition, exploiting the physical linkage between phenotype (peptide or scFv protein) and genotype (coding sequence) of each phage genome present in the phage pool (Figure 2) [53,54]. Based on this concept, NGS was adopted for the screening of antibody libraries to identify potential binders by monitoring the enrichment of a given sequence during the selection cycles [55]. Parallel comparative screenings of antibody libraries by traditional ELISA and NGS have demonstrated that, beyond top-ranking clones efficiently identified by both technologies, deep sequencing enables the discovery of many more specific binders among rare clones with potentially interesting features [38,56]. \n\nELISA and NGS have demonstrated that, beyond top-ranking clones efficiently identified by both technologies, deep sequencing enables the discovery of many more specific binders among rare clones with potentially interesting features [38,56]. Strategies to analyze phage library by second-and third-generation sequencing. On the left, the workflow for extraction of variable fragments compatible with second-generation sequencing platforms (e.g., Illumina MiSeq) is shown. Full-length scFvs and VH fragments are extracted from dsDNA of phages from E. coli. On the right, the workflow for the application of third-generation sequencing of entire scFvs by circular consensus sequencing is represented. Molecular barcoding can be included in both strategies for multiplexing samples. The indicated pros (green font) and cons (red font) are referred to as the current state-of-the-art.\n\n## Conclusions\nMany studies are continually developing methods to overcome these limitations and for high-throughput screening of display libraries. The link between the genotype (scFv coding sequence) and the phenotype (surface-displayed scFv) is the principle for the implementation of sequencing-guided screening of display libraries. Next-generation sequencing allows high-throughput interrogation of the selection steps to evaluate the relative enrichment of scFvs as indicative of their affinity for the target of interest, giving a far greater coverage compared to classical ELISA screening. This coverage also allows the identification of rare clones that, in some cases, can target sub-dominant epitopes with intriguing properties. Beyond the enrichment, high-throughput sequencing allows to discard a priori all those clones bearing non-valid inserts to restrict the analysis to potential binders. To further improve the confidence of binding prediction, we are implementing a database collecting predicted and validated binders to target-unrelated components of the biopanning. Refining the sequencing-guided screening, by applying these informatic scripts, grants dedicated wet step efforts to those scFvs with high-potential to be specific binders. Moreover, the characterization of these false-positive clones' sequences (target-unrelated and selection-unrelated), could lead to an increased understanding of how these clones arise to intervene in crucial selection steps for preventing or limiting this phenomenon. Although next-generation sequencing improved the quality of phage display, there are at least two key limitations: (1) the maximal read length of second-generation sequencing technologies (i.e., Illumina) allows to sequence only a portion of scFvs (e.g., VH), making the reconstruction of the entire antibody fragment challenging; (2) to physically fish out in silico-identified clones of interest, a laborious recovery step is necessary. Long reads obtainable from third-generation sequencing allow achieving quali-quantitative information of the entire scFvs. Not long ago, the relatively low-throughput, the high error rate, and the cost limited the exploitation of third-generation sequencing in display technologies. The circular consensus reads that the more widespread platforms' availability is making this paradigm shift overcome challenges with the higher sequencing error rate, and also leads to a reduction in sequencing costs [65].",

We used our NGS-assisted Fab reconstruction method to recover low-frequency rare clones from phage selection outputs. While previous studies chose rare clones for rescue based on their relative frequencies in sequencing outputs, we chose rare clones for reconstruction from less-frequent CDRH3 lengths. In some cases, reconstructed rare clones (frequency \u223c0.1%) showed higher affinity and better specificity than high-frequency top clones identified by Sanger sequencing, highlighting the significance of NGS-based approaches in synthetic antibody discovery.",

Sequencing of functional antibody repertoires and subsequent bioinformatics analyses has provided unprecedented insights into the mechanisms of B-cell development in humans and other species and has transformed our understanding of immune responses to autoimmunity, vaccination, infection and cancer (34)(35)(36). Sequencing of antibody repertoires is also used for identifying critical biomarkers and epitopes targeted by functional antibody responses for developing vaccines, immunomodulatory drugs and diagnostic tools, and for discovering antibodies (34)(35)(36). NGS technologies have also been employed in several phage display platforms for analyzing natural and synthetic antibody fragment sequences and for identifying and reconstructing scFv and Fab binders not found by conventional ELISA screens (4,37).\n\nIn this work, we developed an NGS-assisted antibody discovery platform. We demonstrated seamless integration of antibody phage display with short-read DNA sequencing using single-framework synthetic Fab libraries rationally engineered to include length and amino acid diversities within CDRs (19,20). Due to limitations in attainable read lengths, NGS of Fab libraries and selection outputs is usually restricted to VH or VL (2,13). Since CDRH3 se- quencing alone is not sufficient for high-throughput reconstruction of Fabs, we developed a method for linking and sequencing all diversified CDRs in phage Fab pools without losing the CDR pairing. Our method determined sequences of paired CDRs in selection outputs and allowed the straightforward conversion of NGS information into Fab clones. Using a defined single-framework, sequencing efforts were directed only toward the diversified CDR regions. NGS primers were designed to anneal the frame-work regions. During sequence analysis, the use of a singleframework eliminated complications associated with the occurrence of multiple frameworks and framework mutations present in natural antibody repertoires enabling fast and accurate interpretation of NGS data sets. The method is rapid and simple and can be adapted to any synthetic scaffoldbased phage library including the HuCal and Ylanthia libraries from MorphoSys (11,(38)(39)(40) by incorporating additional oligonucleotides",

A typical antibody phage display experiment consists of three major steps: (i) generation and display of an antibody library, such as antigen-binding fragment (Fab) library or single-chain variable fragment (scFv) library; (ii) enrichment of antigen-binding antibodies by multiple rounds of binding selection and amplification and (iii) recovery of antigen-specific antibodies from phage selection pools (2). Sanger sequencing is commonly used at each of these steps to decode sequences of antibody fragments recovered from phage pools. It requires the isolation of individual phagemids from phage pools and is practically limited to sequencing a few hundred clones routinely. Since each selection round in phage display gives an output of up to \u223c10 6 sequences, the use of next-generation sequencing (NGS) becomes necessary if one must capture and interrogate the entire sequence diversity present in phage selection outputs. With NGS, entire phage pools can be subjected to sequencing (isolation of individual phagemids is not required) and \u223c10 6 -10 9 sequences can be readily obtained (3,4). Up to ten NGS platforms exist, each with its own advantages and preferred applications, with primary variables being read length, data quality and quantity, time and cost (5,6). Three commonly used NGS platforms in the antibody field include 454 (Roche), MiSeq (Illumina) and Ion Torrent (Life Technologies).\n\nThe Fischer lab was the first to use NGS in antibody phage display (2). They used the Illumina platform to sequence the complementarity-determining region H3 (CDRH3) from a multiple-framework synthetic scFv li-brary. NGS analysis was used to assess the quality of the library and to follow changes in heavy chain germline usage and CDRH3 length distribution over three rounds of selection. They also developed a strategy to rescue rare scFv clones from phage pools using fragment assembly (2).

We used our NGS-assisted Fab reconstruction method to recover low-frequency rare clones from phage selection outputs. While previous studies chose rare clones for rescue based on their relative frequencies in sequencing outputs, we chose rare clones for reconstruction from less-frequent CDRH3 lengths. In some cases, reconstructed rare clones (frequency \u223c0.1%) showed higher affinity and better specificity than high-frequency top clones identified by Sanger sequencing, highlighting the significance of NGS-based approaches in synthetic antibody discovery.\n## INTRODUCTION\nPhage display is a widely used technology for generating, identifying and engineering fully human antibodies, and it has delivered numerous antibodies for research and clinical applications (1). A typical antibody phage display experiment consists of three major steps: (i) generation and display of an antibody library, such as antigen-binding fragment (Fab) library or single-chain variable fragment (scFv) library; (ii) enrichment of antigen-binding antibodies by multiple rounds of binding selection and amplification and (iii) recovery of antigen-specific antibodies from phage selection pools (2). Sanger sequencing is commonly used at each of these steps to decode sequences of antibody fragments recovered from phage pools. It requires the isolation of individual phagemids from phage pools and is practically limited to sequencing a few hundred clones routinely. Since each selection round in phage display gives an output of up to \u223c10 6 sequences, the use of next-generation sequencing (NGS) becomes necessary if one must capture and interrogate the entire sequence diversity present in phage selection outputs. With NGS, entire phage pools can be subjected to sequencing (isolation of individual phagemids is not required) and \u223c10 6 -10 9 sequences can be readily obtained (3,4). Up to ten NGS platforms exist, each with its own advantages and preferred applications, with primary variables being read length, data quality and quantity, time and cost (5,6). Three commonly used NGS platforms in the antibody field include 454 (Roche), MiSeq (Illumina) and Ion Torrent (Life Technologies).\n\nThe Fischer lab was the first to use NGS in antibody phage display (2). They used the Illumina platform to sequence the complementarity-determining region H3 (CDRH3) from a multiple-framework synthetic scFv li-brary. NGS analysis was used to assess the quality of the library and to follow changes in heavy chain germline usage and CDRH3 length distribution over three rounds of selection. They also developed a strategy to rescue rare scFv clones from phage pools using fragment assembly (2). The Fischer lab used the same approach to sequence the CDRH3 region of semi-synthetic scFv libraries and to rescue rare scFv clones from ph\n\n## DISCUSSION\nIn recent years, NGS technologies have revolutionized both fundamental and translational aspects of biological research. Sequencing of functional antibody repertoires and subsequent bioinformatics analyses has provided unprecedented insights into the mechanisms of B-cell development in humans and other species and has transformed our understanding of immune responses to autoimmunity, vaccination, infection and cancer (34)(35)(36). Sequencing of antibody repertoires is also used for identifying critical biomarkers and epitopes targeted by functional antibody responses for developing vaccines, immunomodulatory drugs and diagnostic tools, and for discovering antibodies (34)(35)(36). NGS technologies have also been employed in several phage display platforms for analyzing natural and synthetic antibody fragment sequences and for identifying and reconstructing scFv and Fab binders not found by conventional ELISA screens (4,37).\n\nIn this work, we developed an NGS-assisted antibody discovery platform. We demonstrated seamless integration of antibody phage display with short-read DNA sequencing using single-framework synthetic Fab libraries rationally engineered to include length and amino acid diversities within CDRs (19,20). Due to limitations in attainable read lengths, NGS of Fab libraries and selection outputs is usually restricted to VH or VL (2,13). Since CDRH3 se- quencing alone is not sufficient for high-throughput reconstruction of Fabs, we developed a method for linking and sequencing all diversified CDRs in phage Fab pools without losing the CDR pairing. Our method determined sequences of paired CDRs in selection outputs and allowed the straightforward conversion of NGS information into Fab clones. Using a defined single-framework, sequencing efforts were directed only toward the diversified CDR regions. NGS primers were designed to anneal the frame-work regions. During sequence analysis, the use of a singleframework eliminated complications associated with the occurrence of multiple frameworks and framework mutations present in natural antibody repertoires enabling fast and accurate interpretation of NGS data sets. The method is rapid and simple and can be adapted to any synthetic scaffoldbased phage library including the HuCal and Ylanthia libraries from MorphoSys (11,(38)(39)(40) by incorporating additional oligonucleotides",

In this study, we applied next-generation sequencing (NGS) to screen clones from a library and determine whether a greater number of clones can be identified using NGS than using conventional methods. Three chicken immune single-chain variable fragment (scFv) libraries were subjected to bio-panning on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Phagemid DNA prepared from the original libraries as well as from the Escherichia coli pool after each round of bio-panning was analyzed using NGS, and the heavy chain complementarity-determining region 3 (HCDR3) sequences of the scFv clones were determined. Subsequently, through two-step linker PCR and cloning, the entire scFv gene was retrieved and analyzed for its reactivity to PSA in a phage enzyme immunoassay. After four rounds of bio-panning, the conventional colony screening method was performed for comparison. The scFv clones retrieved from NGS analysis included all clones identified by the conventional colony screening method as well as many additional clones. The enrichment of the HCDR3 sequence throughout the bio-panning process was a positive predictive factor for the selection of PSA-reactive scFv clones.",

More than 54 therapeutic antibodies have been approved for various indications, including cancer and autoimmune diseases. 1 Traditionally, therapeutic antibodies have been generated by mouse B-cell hybridoma technology followed by chimerization or humanization. 2 In the past few decades, technologies such as transgenic mice encompassing human antibody gene repertoires, and phage display of antibody libraries, have become available, facilitating the rapid flourishing of therapeutic antibodies in the drug discovery field. 3 Phage display technology frequently allows the creation of libraries containing up to 10 11 different variants, which can be used to screen antibody clones by bio-panning. 4 Despite the development of alternative display technologies such as bacterial display, yeast display and ribosome display, phage display remains the most widely used display technology due to the robustness of the filamentous bacteriophage M13. 5 Several therapeutic antibodies that are currently either approved or in clinical trials have been developed by phage display technology. 6,7 Recently, next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has allowed a massive increase in capacity to sequence genomes at relatively low cost and in a short time frame. 8 It has revolutionized multiple aspects of biological research 5 and is also actively being adopted into antibody phage display technology. Several NGS platforms are currently available, with average read lengths of 75-8500 bp and different error rates. 9 The CDR3 sequence of the V H and V L genes has been effectively determined by the MiSeq system; 10 a singledomain antibody gene was successfully determined by the MiSeq system using a 2 \u00d7 250 paired-end module; 11 and the entire V H gene was successfully sequenced using the 454 pyrosequencing system. 12 However, sequencing of the entire single-chain variable fragment (scFv) gene, which contains 750-800 bases, could not be achieved using any of these NGS platforms, to the extent of the authors' knowledge.

More than 54 therapeutic antibodies have been approved for various indications, including cancer and autoimmune diseases. 1 Traditionally, therapeutic antibodies have been generated by mouse B-cell hybridoma technology followed by chimerization or humanization. 2 In the past few decades, technologies such as transgenic mice encompassing human antibody gene repertoires, and phage display of antibody libraries, have become available, facilitating the rapid flourishing of therapeutic antibodies in the drug discovery field. 3 Phage display technology frequently allows the creation of libraries containing up to 10 11 different variants, which can be used to screen antibody clones by bio-panning. 4 Despite the development of alternative display technologies such as bacterial display, yeast display and ribosome display, phage display remains the most widely used display technology due to the robustness of the filamentous bacteriophage M13. 5 Several therapeutic antibodies that are currently either approved or in clinical trials have been developed by phage display technology. 6,7 Recently, next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has allowed a massive increase in capacity to sequence genomes at relatively low cost and in a short time frame. 8 It has revolutionized multiple aspects of biological research 5 and is also actively being adopted into antibody phage display technology. Several NGS platforms are currently available, with average read lengths of 75-8500 bp and different error rates. 9 The CDR3 sequence of the V H and V L genes has been effectively determined by the MiSeq system; 10 a singledomain antibody gene was successfully determined by the MiSeq system using a 2 \u00d7 250 paired-end module; 11 and the entire V H gene was successfully sequenced using the 454 pyrosequencing system. 12 However, sequencing of the entire single-chain variable fragment (scFv) gene, which contains 750-800 bases, could not be achieved using any of these NGS platforms, to the extent of the authors' knowledge. In one study, to obtain the whole scFv gene sequence, HCDR3 sequences were first determined by the MiSeq system; the entire scFv gene was then generated by two-step linker PCR using primers based on the heavy chain complementarity",

Moreover, with ongoing advances in sequencing technology, depth and read length is improving continuously: for instance, the PacBio Sequel system generates approximately seven times more sequences than the previous RS II system but maintains its long-read capability (Pacific Biosciences), while nanopore systems such as the MinIOn (Oxford Nanopore) offer the promise of real-time DNA sequencing in combination with ultra-long reads.

                    "text": "The development of antibody display technology such as phage (1), ribosome (2), yeast (3), and mammalian display (4) has enabled the rapid selection of binders from diverse libraries. These technologies bypass the use of animals and allow for the enrichment of binders within days to weeks. The power of in vitro selection technologies relies on a direct physical link between phenotype (displayed antibody construct) and genotype (antibody variable domain genes), allowing for the identification of binders through sequencing of their encoding genes. Multiple rounds of selection are generally required to identify antigen-specific binders, either by binding to a solid support or through cellular sorting (5). In many cases, later rounds of selections tend to be dominated by a handful of clones, which are then further characterized for affinity. Such clonal dominance can reflect genuine selection for high antigen affinity but might also reflect other properties such as superior expression or display. Consequently, clones with superior affinity may be present at low frequency and may not be readily detectable using traditional screening methods such as ELISA (6). \n\nRecent advances in DNA sequencing technologies and computing power over the last decade has led to a dramatic reduction in the cost of sequencing and has simplified data analyses (7). Although initially developed for genomics applications, such as whole-genome sequencing, transcriptome sequencing, and epigenetics, next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology is now increasingly being applied other fields, including to basic and applied immunology. This includes the sequencing of the paired human heavy and light chain repertoire from isolated na\u00efve (8,9) and antigen-specific B-cells (10,11), as well as T-cell receptor (12) and antibody display repertoires (13). While most NGS platforms were originally designed for short reads, technology is evolving rapidly, extending both read length and depth. Here, we review recent advances in NGS technology and key applications to phage display and other in vitro selection technologies.",

Langley, D. Christ\n## Abstract\nIn vitro selection technology has transformed the development of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. Using methods such as phage, ribosome, and yeast display, high affinity binders can be selected from diverse repertoires. Here, we review strategies for the next-generation sequencing (NGS) of phage- and other antibody-display libraries, as well as NGS platforms and analysis tools. Moreover, we discuss recent examples relating to the use of NGS to assess library diversity, clonal enrichment, and affinity maturation.\n## inTRODUCTiOn\nThe development of antibody display technology such as phage (1), ribosome (2), yeast (3), and mammalian display (4) has enabled the rapid selection of binders from diverse libraries. These technologies bypass the use of animals and allow for the enrichment of binders within days to weeks. The power of in vitro selection technologies relies on a direct physical link between phenotype (displayed antibody construct) and genotype (antibody variable domain genes), allowing for the identification of binders through sequencing of their encoding genes. Multiple rounds of selection are generally required to identify antigen-specific binders, either by binding to a solid support or through cellular sorting (5). In many cases, later rounds of selections tend to be dominated by a handful of clones, which are then further characterized for affinity. Such clonal dominance can reflect genuine selection for high antigen affinity but might also reflect other properties such as superior expression or display. Consequently, clones with superior affinity may be present at low frequency and may not be readily detectable using traditional screening methods such as ELISA (6). \n\nRecent advances in DNA sequencing technologies and computing power over the last decade has led to a dramatic reduction in the cost of sequencing and has simplified data analyses (7). Although initially developed for genomics applications, such as whole-genome sequencing, transcriptome sequencing, and epigenetics, next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology is now increasingly being applied other fields, including to basic and applied immunology. This includes the sequencing of the paired human heavy and light chain repertoire from isolated na\u00efve (8,9) and antigen-specific B-cells (10,11), as well as T-cell receptor (12) and antibody display repertoires (13). While most NGS platforms were originally designed for short reads, technology is evolving rapidly, extending both read length and depth. Here, we review recent advances in NGS technology and key applications to phage display and other in vitro selection technologies.\n\n## COnCLUSiOn\nNext-generation sequencing holds great promise for the development of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, by allowing unprecedented insights into library diversity and clonal enrichment. Although current NGS platforms were not designed with antibody libraries in mind, the technologies are now at a stage where unique sequence insights into all stages of the selection process can be obtained. Moreover, with ongoing advances in sequencing technology, depth and read length is improving continuously: for instance, the PacBio Sequel system generates approximately seven times more sequences than the previous RS II system but maintains its long-read capability (Pacific Biosciences), while nanopore systems such as the MinIOn (Oxford Nanopore) offer the promise of real-time DNA sequencing in combination with ultra-long reads. We conclude that, with NGS technology evolving at a rapid pace, its importance in the sequence analyses of phage-and other antibody-display libraries is likely to continue to increase.",

                    "text": "For over two decades, phage display has been used to identify relevant protein interaction and recognition sites in receptorligand and antigen-antibody binding systems. Because of the strong predictive value of functional relationships revealed by specific protein interactions, peptide-protein or antibody-antigen pairs selected from phage display libraries serve as potential reagents in a vast range of biomedical and translational applications [1][2][3][4]. \n\nA conventional phage display selection typically starts with exposure of a library to targets of interest in vitro or in vivo. After the unbound and non-specific binding populations are removed, the remaining phage particles are recovered by infection and amplification in host bacteria growing in medium under either a selective genetic pressure (such as antibiotic resistance) or a differential identifying color scheme. Host bacteria allow viral multiplication and generate thousands of newly-formed phage particles. Upon plating of the host bacteria, lysogenic phage (i.e., non-lytic M13-derived) yields bacterial colonies whereas lytic phage (i.e., Lambda-derived) generates plaques in a bacterial lawn; each resulting bacterial colony or phage plaque is considered a transducing-unit (TU). Amplified phage populations serve for additional selection round(s) and allow enrichment of selective clones, which may be determined by comparing unselected to selected libraries through DNA sequencing [1][2][3][4]. Thus, the two most labor-and cost-intensive steps in phage display selection are (i) the counting of transducing units and (ii) the phage DNA sequencing (from each individual colony or plaque) to determine the corresponding peptide sequence of the encoded ligand(s). This straightforward, if cumbersome, approach has long provided biomedical findings of value; however, new large-scale technologies for DNA quantification and sequencing can potentially overcome some of the practical limitations of the conventional methodology for phage display selection. \n\nTo address this prospect, we have adapted emerging genomic methodologies to eliminate these two rate-limiting steps: we used real-time PCR for rapid TU quantification and next-generation sequencing for large-scale analysis.",

Dias-Neto, D. Nunes, R. Giordano, Jessica H. Sun, G. Botz, Kuan Yang, J. Setubal, R. Pasqualini, W. Arap\n## Abstract\nBackground Combinatorial phage display has been used in the last 20 years in the identification of protein-ligands and protein-protein interactions, uncovering relevant molecular recognition events. Rate-limiting steps of combinatorial phage display library selection are (i) the counting of transducing units and (ii) the sequencing of the encoded displayed ligands. Here, we adapted emerging genomic technologies to minimize such challenges. Methodology/Principal Findings We gained efficiency by applying in tandem real-time PCR for rapid quantification to enable bacteria-free phage display library screening, and added phage DNA next-generation sequencing for large-scale ligand analysis, reporting a fully integrated set of high-throughput quantitative and analytical tools. The approach is far less labor-intensive and allows rigorous quantification; for medical applications, including selections in patients, it also represents an advance for quantitative distribution analysis and ligand identification of hundreds of thousands of targeted particles from patient-derived biopsy or autopsy in a longer timeframe post library administration. Additional advantages over current methods include increased sensitivity, less variability, enhanced linearity, scalability, and accuracy at much lower cost. Sequences obtained by qPhage plus pyrosequencing were similar to a dataset produced from conventional Sanger-sequenced transducing-units (TU), with no biases due to GC content, codon usage, and amino acid or peptide frequency. These tools allow phage display selection and ligand analysis at >1,000-fold faster rate, and reduce costs \u223c250-fold for generating 106 ligand sequences. Conclusions/Significance Our analyses demonstrates that whereas this approach correlates with the traditional colony-counting, it is also capable of a much larger sampling, allowing a faster, less expensive, more accurate and consistent analysis of phage enrichment. Overall, qPhage plus pyrosequencing is superior to TU-counting plus Sanger sequencing and is proposed as the method of choice over a broad range of phage display applications in vitro, in cells, and in vivo.\n## Introduction\nFor over two decades, phage display has been used to identify relevant protein interaction and recognition sites in receptorligand and antigen-antibody binding systems. Because of the strong predictive value of functional relationships revealed by specific protein interactions, peptide-protein or antibody-antigen pairs selected from phage display libraries serve as potential reagents in a vast range of biomedical and translational applications [1][2][3][4]. \n\nA conventional phage display selection typically starts with exposure of a library to targets of interest in vitro or in vivo. After the unbound and non-specific binding populations are removed, the remaining phage particles are recovered by infection and amplification in host bacteria growing in medium under either a selective genetic pressure (such as antibiotic resistance) or a differential identifying color scheme. Host bacteria allow viral multiplication and generate thousands of newly-formed phage particles. Upon plating of the host bacteria, lysogenic phage (i.e., non-lytic M13-derived) yields bacterial colonies whereas lytic phage (i.e., Lambda-derived) generates plaques in a bacterial lawn; each resulting bacterial colony or phage plaque is considered a transducing-unit (TU). Amplified phage populations serve for additional selection round(s) and allow enrichment of selective clones, which may be determined by comparing unselected to selected libraries through DNA sequencing [1][2][3][4]. Thus, the two most labor-and cost-intensive steps in phage display selection are (i) the counting of transducing units and (ii) the phage DNA sequencing (from each individual colony or plaque) to determine the corresponding peptide sequence of the encoded ligand(s). This straightforward, if cumbersome, approach has long provided biomedical findings of value; however, new large-scale technologies for DNA quantification and sequencing can potentially overcome some of the practical limitations of the conventional methodology for phage display selection. \n\nTo address this prospect, we have adapted emerging genomic methodologies to eliminate these two rate-limiting steps: we used real-time PCR for rapid TU quantification and next-generation sequencing for large-scale analysis.\n...\nTo address this prospect, we have adapted emerging genomic methodologies to eliminate these two rate-limiting steps: we used real-time PCR for rapid TU quantification and next-generation sequencing for large-scale analysis. We present a side-by-side comparison of all steps and report an integrated experimental system that greatly streamlines and expedites the entire procedure while markedly reducing its associated costs about 250-fold compared to conventional phage display selection. We show that this new methodology is not only much faster and less laborintensive, but allows rigorous quantification with improved overall accuracy. In as-yet unpublished work, deep amplicon sequencing of phage particles (i.e., tens of thousands of clones) recovered from in vivo selections in human patients in a timeframe of up to 72 hours post library administration (in contrast to less than 24 hours for the current methodology), has allowed coverage of the full repertoire of targeted particles in the analyzed tissue samples, as shown by saturation curves and the identification of a panel of previously unrecognized ligand-receptor candidates. These molecular tools will enable a new generation of highthroughput and cost-effective phage display selection on an unprecedented large-scale.\n\n## Discussion\nIn this study, we address the two least efficient steps of phage display library selection: quantification and analysis of the displayed ligands. We introduce an integrated, robust, and readily available set of DNA-based molecular tools that will markedly improve combinatorial analysis in vitro and in vivo, and at an extremely low cost in labor and time. \n\nPhage library quantification is currently scored through phage infection of host bacteria, serial dilution, and TU-counting (i.e., individual colony or plaque).

Immune phage display offers several advantages over na\u00efve or synthetic display approaches, increasing the likelihood of isolating stable, high-affinity specific antibodies due to pre-enrichment and in-vivo affinity maturation. 5 Traditional isolation of antibodies from phage display libraries involves multiple rounds of panning followed by screening and sequencing of positive clones. A key limitation when identifying clones is the screening step following enrichment. Selecting clones can be technically challenging and time consuming, and the process is often hampered by dominant clones within the enriched population, which makes it difficult to identify alternative binders with lower representation within the pool.\n\nDespite recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, sequence read length is a limitation in their application to phage display screening. The majority of NGS platform technologies allow a maximum read length of up to 500 base pair (bp), 6 which has extensively been used for the analysis of immunoglobulin (Ig)-repertoires in several species. This length, however, is not sufficient to cover a full singlechain variable fragment (scFv) sequences. 7,8 Currently, sequencing of the entire variable heavy (VH) and variable light (VL) fragment of a single chain is not routinely carried out and is not possible using conventional NGS platforms. Single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing allows the contiguous sequencing of fragments of up to 8500 bp, 9 but read length comes at the expense of sequence fidelity. 10 A recent advance in SMRT sequencing is the addition of hairpin loops to double-stranded DNA fragments. 11 Consensus sequencing of adaptor ligated fragments can increase the sequence accuracy of an 850 bp fragment (the approximate length of an average scFv) to 99.99%. 12 Hemadou et al. first demonstrated this approach to be effective at accurately identifying full-length scFvs in an enriched fully human,",

Onuoha\n## Abstract\nABSTRACT Phage display technology in combination with next-generation sequencing (NGS) currently is a state-of-the-art method for the enrichment and isolation of monoclonal antibodies from diverse libraries. However, the current NGS methods employed for sequencing phage display libraries are limited by the short contiguous read lengths associated with second-generation sequencing platforms. Consequently, the identification of antibody sequences has conventionally been restricted to individual antibody domains or to the analysis of single domain binding moieties such as camelid VHH or cartilaginous fish IgNAR antibodies. In this study, we report the application of third-generation sequencing to address this limitation. We used single molecule real time (SMRT) sequencing coupled with hairpin adaptor loop ligation to facilitate the accurate interrogation of full-length single-chain Fv (scFv) libraries. Our method facilitated the rapid isolation and testing of scFv antibodies enriched from phage display libraries within days following panning. Two libraries against CD160 and CD123 were panned and monitored by NGS. Analysis of NGS antibody data sets led to the isolation of several functional scFv antibodies that were not identified by conventional panning and screening strategies. Our approach, which combines phage display selection of immune libraries with the full-length interrogation of scFv fragments, is an easy method to discover functional antibodies, with a range of affinities and biophysical characteristics.\n## Introduction\nDisplay technologies, such as phage, yeast and ribosome display are important tools in the identification of therapeutic antibodies. 1 In particular, phage display is widely used at several stages of the drug discovery process.

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) presented itself as a robust solution, making it possible to assess billions of sequences of the variable domains from selected sublibraries. Handling this process, a central difficulty is to find the selected clones. Here, we present the AutomaTed Tool For Immunoglobulin Analysis (ATTILA), a new tool to analyze and find the enriched variable domains throughout a biopanning experiment. The ATTILA is a workflow that combines publicly available tools and in-house programs and scripts to find the fold-change frequency of deeply sequenced amplicons generated from selected VH and VL domains. We analyzed the same human Fab library NGS data using ATTILA in 5 different experiments, as well as on 2 biopanning experiments regarding performance, accuracy, and output. These analyses proved to be suitable to assess library variability and to list the more enriched variable domains, as ATTILA provides a report with the amino acid sequence of each identified domain, along with its complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), germline classification, and fold change. Finally, the methods employed here demonstrated a suitable manner to combine amplicon generation and NGS data analysis to discover new monoclonal antibodies (mAbs).",

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) presented itself as a robust solution, making it possible to assess billions of sequences of the variable domains from selected sublibraries. Handling this process, a central difficulty is to find the selected clones. Here, we present the AutomaTed Tool For Immunoglobulin Analysis (ATTILA), a new tool to analyze and find the enriched variable domains throughout a biopanning experiment. The ATTILA is a workflow that combines publicly available tools and in-house programs and scripts to find the fold-change frequency of deeply sequenced amplicons generated from selected VH and VL domains. We analyzed the same human Fab library NGS data using ATTILA in 5 different experiments, as well as on 2 biopanning experiments regarding performance, accuracy, and output. These analyses proved to be suitable to assess library variability and to list the more enriched variable domains, as ATTILA provides a report with the amino acid sequence of each identified domain, along with its complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), germline classification, and fold change. Finally, the methods employed here demonstrated a suitable manner to combine amplicon generation and NGS data analysis to discover new monoclonal antibodies (mAbs).\n## Introduction\nThe use of phage-display antibody combinatorial libraries has impulsed the isolation of innovative antibodies.

Systematic characterization of the library revealed multiple sdAbs with high affinity for three therapeutically relevant antigens. In conclusion, our alpaca sdAb phage display library provides a versatile resource for diagnostics and therapeutics.

                    "text": "The antibody display system includes the phage display, yeast display, bacterial surface display, and ribosome display [28][29][30]. Among these systems, a phage display antibody library is a collection of diverse antibody fragments genetically fused to coat proteins on the surface of bacteriophages, allowing for the display of a wide range of antibodies [31][32][33][34]. It serves as a versatile and widely used tool for engineering antibodies and drug discovery [35]. The diversity of the library plays a pivotal role in isolating antibodies with high specificity for a given target using phage display technology. In mammals, V(D)J recombination is a key process that contributes to the diversification of the B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire, which is capable of recognizing a wide range of antigens [36]. Additionally, random nucleotide deletions or insertions at the junction regions of gene segments contribute to the final diversity of the BCR repertoire [37]. For na\u00efve libraries constructed without any process of immunization, the theoretical diversity increases with the number of initially collected lymphocytes, enriching a more extensive range of potential binding specificities. Although it has been reported that a single donor is sufficient to produce a highly functional antibody library, recent studies of the B cell repertoire have suggested that individuals possess a unique immune system and do not extensively share common B cell clonotypes [20,38]. Hence, multiple donors' blood samples are beneficial for expanding the antibody library's repertoire. Therefore, we assumed that the construction of phage display libraries using numerous lymphocytes collected from an increased number of different donors would enhance the diversity of the library, leading to the rapid discovery of diverse high-quality antibodies. \n\nNext-generation sequencing (NGS), also known as high-throughput sequencing, is an emerging technology for rapidly sequencing DNA fragments in large-scale experiments [39]. In contrast to the traditional Sanger sequencing method, which has limitations, such as intensive labor, high cost, and the limited throughput of the number of DNA types that can be decoded at once, this high-throughput capability is especially valuable for the characterization and assessment of the quality of antibody libraries [40,41].",

In this study, we constructed a phage display library comprising single-domain antibodies (sdAbs; or \u201cVHHs\u201d), known for their small size and remarkable stability, using a total of 1.6 \u00d7 109 lymphocytes collected from 20 different alpacas, resulting in approximately 7.16 \u00d7 1010 colonies. To assess the quality of the constructed library, next-generation sequencing-based high-throughput profiling was performed, analyzing approximately 5.65 \u00d7 106 full-length VHH sequences, revealing 92% uniqueness and confirming the library\u2019s diverse composition. Systematic characterization of the library revealed multiple sdAbs with high affinity for three therapeutically relevant antigens. In conclusion, our alpaca sdAb phage display library provides a versatile resource for diagnostics and therapeutics. Furthermore, the library\u2019s vast natural VHH antibody repertoire offers insights for generating humanized synthetic sdAb libraries, further advancing sdAb-based therapeutics.\n## Introduction\nThe antibody display system includes the phage display, yeast display, bacterial surface display, and ribosome display [28][29][30]. Among these systems, a phage display antibody library is a collection of diverse antibody fragments genetically fused to coat proteins on the surface of bacteriophages, allowing for the display of a wide range of antibodies [31][32][33][34]. It serves as a versatile and widely used tool for engineering antibodies and drug discovery [35]. The diversity of the library plays a pivotal role in isolating antibodies with high specificity for a given target using phage display technology. In mammals, V(D)J recombination is a key process that contributes to the diversification of the B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire, which is capable of recognizing a wide range of antigens [36]. Additionally, random nucleotide deletions or insertions at the junction regions of gene segments contribute to the final diversity of the BCR repertoire [37]. For na\u00efve libraries constructed without any process of immunization, the theoretical diversity increases with the number of initially collected lymphocytes, enriching a more extensive range of potential binding specificities. Although it has been reported that a single donor is sufficient to produce a highly functional antibody library, recent studies of the B cell repertoire have suggested that individuals possess a unique immune system and do not extensively share common B cell clonotypes [20,38]. Hence, multiple donors' blood samples are beneficial for expanding the antibody library's repertoire. Therefore, we assumed that the construction of phage display libraries using numerous lymphocytes collected from an increased number of different donors would enhance the diversity of the library, leading to the rapid discovery of diverse high-quality antibodies. \n\nNext-generation sequencing (NGS), also known as high-throughput sequencing, is an emerging technology for rapidly sequencing DNA fragments in large-scale experiments [39]. In contrast to the traditional Sanger sequencing method, which has limitations, such as intensive labor, high cost, and the limited throughput of the number of DNA types that can be decoded at once, this high-throughput capability is especially valuable for the characterization and assessment of the quality of antibody libraries [40,41].\n...\nIn contrast to the traditional Sanger sequencing method, which has limitations, such as intensive labor, high cost, and the limited throughput of the number of DNA types that can be decoded at once, this high-throughput capability is especially valuable for the characterization and assessment of the quality of antibody libraries [40,41].

Antigen-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are crucial for many assays to support vaccine development. Objective: In this study, we used the HuCal Fab phage display library with a diversity of 4.5 \u00d7 1010 to identify antibodies specific to the spike proteins of the four endemic coronaviruses: OC43, NL63, 229E, and HKU1. Methods: As proof of concept, we established a newly designed platform using a long-read NGS workflow for antibody discovery and compared the results against the traditional workflow using Sanger sequencing consisting of lengthy and laborious benchwork. Results: The long-read NGS workflow identified most of the antibodies seen from the Sanger sequencing workflow, and many more additional antigen-specific antibodies against the endemic coronaviruses. Overall efficiency improved up to three times, comparing the traditional workflow with the NGS workflow. Of the 113 NGS-derived mAbs isolated to bind the four endemic coronavirus spike proteins, 107/113 (94.7%) had potent ELISA binding affinities (EC50 < 150 ng/mL, or <1 nM), and 61/113 (54%) had extremely potent ELISA binding affinities (EC50 of <15 ng/mL, or <0.1 nM). Conclusions: We successfully developed and incorporated the long-read NGS workflow to generate target-specific antibodies with many antibodies at sub-nanomolar affinities that are likely missed by a traditional workflow. We identified strong neutralizing antibodies, proving that our endemic spike proteins are capable of generating antibodies that could offer protection against the endemic HCoVs.",

Vora, Arthur Fridman, Zhifeng Chen\n## Abstract\nBackground: There is an unmet medical need to develop a vaccine targeting endemic coronaviruses. Antigen-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are crucial for many assays to support vaccine development. Objective: In this study, we used the HuCal Fab phage display library with a diversity of 4.5 \u00d7 1010 to identify antibodies specific to the spike proteins of the four endemic coronaviruses: OC43, NL63, 229E, and HKU1. Methods: As proof of concept, we established a newly designed platform using a long-read NGS workflow for antibody discovery and compared the results against the traditional workflow using Sanger sequencing consisting of lengthy and laborious benchwork. Results: The long-read NGS workflow identified most of the antibodies seen from the Sanger sequencing workflow, and many more additional antigen-specific antibodies against the endemic coronaviruses. Overall efficiency improved up to three times, comparing the traditional workflow with the NGS workflow. Of the 113 NGS-derived mAbs isolated to bind the four endemic coronavirus spike proteins, 107/113 (94.7%) had potent ELISA binding affinities (EC50 < 150 ng/mL, or <1 nM), and 61/113 (54%) had extremely potent ELISA binding affinities (EC50 of <15 ng/mL, or <0.1 nM). Conclusions: We successfully developed and incorporated the long-read NGS workflow to generate target-specific antibodies with many antibodies at sub-nanomolar affinities that are likely missed by a traditional workflow. We identified strong neutralizing antibodies, proving that our endemic spike proteins are capable of generating antibodies that could offer protection against the endemic HCoVs.\n## Introduction\nGeorge P.

Some phages have also been engineered into good expression vectors for coupling genotypes and phenotypes, which can be utilized to harness the power of evolution by artificial selection. Phage display is a powerful and versatile technology for constructing a library of peptides or antibodies displayed on phage virions, and then screening them for peptides or antibodies with desired properties. In 2018, one-half of the Nobel Prize in chemistry was awarded jointly to George P. Smith and Sir Gregory P. Winter for the \"phage display of peptides and antibodies\" (Smith, 2019;Winter, 2019). Phage display has been widely used to map epitopes, identify drug targets (Takakusagi et al., 2020), and develop therapeutics, diagnostics, and vaccines. \n\nIn the present Research Topic, we have organized 11 articles, including seven original research papers, two method papers, and two reviews, to share the authors' understanding of the phage display technique and its applications from various angles. \n\nNext-generation sequencing (NGS) has been employed in most, if not all, fields of biology and medicine. Phage display is no exception, either for antibodies or peptides. Using the Roche 454 NGS platform, Lisowska et al. identified over 13,000 peptides targeting ubiquitin and over 10,000 peptides against ubiquitin-like modifier NEDD8 from the Ph.D.-12 Phage Display Peptide Library. Two peptides were further confirmed to inhibit both E3 ubiquitin ligases, MDM2 and CHIP, and their binding modes were solved by the NMR analysis. Zhao et al. made a phage panning scheme that separately covered selections against phosphotyrosine (pTyr) and sulfated tyrosine (sTyr) peptides, followed by NGS. After mining the NGS data and validating with experiments, they successfully identified some sTyr superbinders. Maruthachalam et al. designed three synthetic Fab libraries based on a modified trastuzumab framework.",

Editorial: Phage display: Technique and applications\n## Editorial on the Research Topic Phage display: Technique and applications\nPhages are the most abundant organisms on the earth and have a great impact on the earth's ecosystems. Some phages have also been engineered into good expression vectors for coupling genotypes and phenotypes, which can be utilized to harness the power of evolution by artificial selection. Phage display is a powerful and versatile technology for constructing a library of peptides or antibodies displayed on phage virions, and then screening them for peptides or antibodies with desired properties. In 2018, one-half of the Nobel Prize in chemistry was awarded jointly to George P. Smith and Sir Gregory P. Winter for the \"phage display of peptides and antibodies\" (Smith, 2019;Winter, 2019). Phage display has been widely used to map epitopes, identify drug targets (Takakusagi et al., 2020), and develop therapeutics, diagnostics, and vaccines. \n\nIn the present Research Topic, we have organized 11 articles, including seven original research papers, two method papers, and two reviews, to share the authors' understanding of the phage display technique and its applications from various angles. \n\nNext-generation sequencing (NGS) has been employed in most, if not all, fields of biology and medicine. Phage display is no exception, either for antibodies or peptides. Using the Roche 454 NGS platform, Lisowska et al. identified over 13,000 peptides targeting ubiquitin and over 10,000 peptides against ubiquitin-like modifier NEDD8 from the Ph.D.-12 Phage Display Peptide Library. Two peptides were further confirmed to inhibit both E3 ubiquitin ligases, MDM2 and CHIP, and their binding modes were solved by the NMR analysis. Zhao et al. made a phage panning scheme that separately covered selections against phosphotyrosine (pTyr) and sulfated tyrosine (sTyr) peptides, followed by NGS. After mining the NGS data and validating with experiments, they successfully identified some sTyr superbinders. Maruthachalam et al. designed three synthetic Fab libraries based on a modified trastuzumab framework.",

At the same time, the range of applications extended from the identification of novel allergens over disease markers to protein-protein interaction studies. However, the generation and selection of cDNA phage display libraries is subjected to intrinsic biological limitations due to their complex nature and heterogeneity, as well as technical difficulties regarding protein presentation on the phage surface. Here, we review the latest developments in this field, discuss a number of strategies and improvements anticipated to overcome these challenges making cDNA and open reading frame (ORF) libraries more readily accessible for phage display.

Being able to sequence millions of DNA molecules at a time in practically only a few days has a major impact on the way selections and their evaluation can be performed. For instance, the diversity of initial libraries can be analyzed, as demonstrated by Pons and co-workers [73]. They have obtained more than one million sequences for their na\u00efve scFv phage display library using Roche/454-pyrosequencing, which has allowed the analysis of immunoglobulin V-gene usage in their library. Furthermore, NGS made it possible to follow the enrichment process of displayed molecules during all rounds of selection. Dias-Neto et al. recently used the Roche/454-pyrosequencing platform to analyze the outcome of in vivo peptide library selections in cancer patients [74]. They additionally evaluated the outcome of the selection by sequencing large numbers of clones by the Sanger method and a comparison of these results with NGS revealed that ~80-95% of all sequences generated by traditional sequencing have also been recovered by NGS. In another recent report, Ravn et al. monitored the enrichment process over multiple rounds of selection with an antibody library in scFv format using the Illumina/Solexa Genome analyzer platform [75]. They could demonstrate that all positive clones identified by classical ELISA conducted at the end of a selection were also recovered by NGS. Yet some highly enriched clones were missed by conventional ELISA-screening but successfully identified by NGS. These clones were subsequently analyzed and found to be badly expressed in E. coli as soluble antibody fragments and hence escaped the ELISA screening. \n\nApplying a phage display library of fragmented human cDNA, Di Niro et al. conducted a proteinprotein interaction screen for the identification of interaction partners of human transglutaminase 2 (TG2) [30].",

Konthur\n## Abstract\nThe last decade has seen a steady increase in screening of cDNA expression product libraries displayed on the surface of filamentous bacteriophage. At the same time, the range of applications extended from the identification of novel allergens over disease markers to protein-protein interaction studies. However, the generation and selection of cDNA phage display libraries is subjected to intrinsic biological limitations due to their complex nature and heterogeneity, as well as technical difficulties regarding protein presentation on the phage surface. Here, we review the latest developments in this field, discuss a number of strategies and improvements anticipated to overcome these challenges making cDNA and open reading frame (ORF) libraries more readily accessible for phage display. Furthermore, future trends combining phage display with next generation sequencing (NGS) will be presented.\n## OPEN ACCESS\nFor instance, the use of cDNA fragmentation and ORF selection strategies prior initial library preparation leading to an increased expression of functional clones and improved presentation, as well as the application of different vector systems avoiding direct fusion to pIII. Furthermore, the use of comprehensive full-length ORFeome collections bypassing the application of conventional cDNA libraries and the implementation of next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies for fast and reliable identification of enriched binders will be discussed. While most of these considerations inevitably also apply to alternative phage display approaches, such as lambda and T7 display, we focus on the filamentous bacteriophage M13. Alternative phage display systems and their applications were discussed elsewhere [17][18][19].\n\n## Implementation of Next Generation Sequencing\nThe ever-increasing sequencing capacity of next generation sequencing (NGS) platforms, such as Roche/454-pyrosequencing or Illumina/Solexa Genome analyzer, revolutionized life sciences since its introduction and paved the way for completely novel approaches boosting biological and medical research [72]. \n\nCombining the power of NGS with the power of affinity driven selection strategies, such as phage display, has already started to change our way of thinking. Being able to sequence millions of DNA molecules at a time in practically only a few days has a major impact on the way selections and their evaluation can be performed. For instance, the diversity of initial libraries can be analyzed, as demonstrated by Pons and co-workers [73]. They have obtained more than one million sequences for their na\u00efve scFv phage display library using Roche/454-pyrosequencing, which has allowed the analysis of immunoglobulin V-gene usage in their library. Furthermore, NGS made it possible to follow the enrichment process of displayed molecules during all rounds of selection. Dias-Neto et al. recently used the Roche/454-pyrosequencing platform to analyze the outcome of in vivo peptide library selections in cancer patients [74]. They additionally evaluated the outcome of the selection by sequencing large numbers of clones by the Sanger method and a comparison of these results with NGS revealed that ~80-95% of all sequences generated by traditional sequencing have also been recovered by NGS. In another recent report, Ravn et al. monitored the enrichment process over multiple rounds of selection with an antibody library in scFv format using the Illumina/Solexa Genome analyzer platform [75]. They could demonstrate that all positive clones identified by classical ELISA conducted at the end of a selection were also recovered by NGS. Yet some highly enriched clones were missed by conventional ELISA-screening but successfully identified by NGS. These clones were subsequently analyzed and found to be badly expressed in E. coli as soluble antibody fragments and hence escaped the ELISA screening. \n\nApplying a phage display library of fragmented human cDNA, Di Niro et al. conducted a proteinprotein interaction screen for the identification of interaction partners of human transglutaminase 2 (TG2) [30].\n\n## Conclusions and Outlook\nIn the last decades, numerous combinatorial methodologies for the selection and screening of proteins were developed, which mimic natural evolutionary processes in vitro and aim at detecting interaction partners with specific chemical and/or physical properties. Among these, surface display technologies play a central role and besides bacterial, ribosomal, yeast and other screening methods, phage display is by far the most widespread application for screening of protein interaction partners or selecting antibodies for diagnostic and therapeutic applications [76]. \n\nWith the latest developments discussed here, the presentation of cDNA and ORF expression products on phage has become not only possible, but led to an increase in library quality, produced indepth analysis of the enrichment process, became faster, more convenient and reasonably priced. Thus the application of this approach and variations thereof will increase constantly in the future. Most application areas described in this review centre around the identification of novel allergens, potential biomarkers in autoimmune disorders [43,77], cancer [78,79] or vaccine development [80]. However, additional fields of application, such as screening for cellular targets of toxic chemical compounds emerge [81]. \n\nThe next level of phage display will indisputably see the implementation of NGS into automation strategies for screening of combinatorial libraries [82]. The application of semi-automated selection strategies, such as developed in our laboratory [83,84] not only allows the reduction of variability and increased reproducibility of the selection protocol, but can be readily implemented in process pipelines based on unit-automation [85,86]. Such pipelines, in turn, can be easily extended to include NGS as a sophisticated analysis tool of the selection outcome. \n\nTwenty-five years after its introduction, phage display persists to be the most popular and successful surface display application with more than 4,000 entries in PubMed. With the latest developments in library design and the combination of phage display with high-throughput selection pipelines and next generation sequencing, the field has become as vibrant as ever.",

One method to identify such peptide ligands, phage display, enables high-throughput screening of peptide libraries for ligands binding to therapeutic targets of interest.

Pun\n## Abstract\nPeptide ligands are used to increase the specificity of drug carriers to their target cells and to facilitate intracellular delivery. One method to identify such peptide ligands, phage display, enables high-throughput screening of peptide libraries for ligands binding to therapeutic targets of interest. However, conventional methods for identifying target binders in a library by Sanger sequencing are low-throughput, labor-intensive, and provide a limited perspective (<0.01%) of the complete sequence space. Moreover, the small sample space can be dominated by nonspecific, preferentially amplifying \"parasitic sequences\" and plastic-binding sequences, which may lead to the identification of false positives or exclude the identification of target-binding sequences. To overcome these challenges, we employed next-generation Illumina sequencing to couple high-throughput screening and high-throughput sequencing, enabling more comprehensive access to the phage display library sequence space. In this work, we define the hallmarks of binding sequences in next-generation sequencing data, and develop a method that identifies several target-binding phage clones for murine, alternatively activated M2 macrophages with a high (100%) success rate: sequences and binding motifs were reproducibly present across biological replicates; binding motifs were identified across multiple unique sequences; and an unselected, amplified library accurately filtered out parasitic sequences.

Although successful, traditional phage library screening is laborious and can map only some of the epitopes. To accelerate and improve epitope identification, we have employed massive sequencing of phage-displayed antigen-specific libraries using the Illumina MiSeq platform. This enabled us to precisely identify the regions of a model antigen, the meningococcal NadA virulence factor, targeted by serum antibodies in vaccinated individuals and to rank hundreds of antigenic fragments according to their immunoreactivity. We found that next generation sequencing can significantly empower the analysis of antigen-specific libraries by allowing simultaneous processing of dozens of library/serum combinations in less than two days, including the time required for antibody-mediated library selection. Moreover, compared with traditional plaque picking, the new technology (named Phage-based Representation OF Immuno-Ligand Epitope Repertoire or PROFILER) provides superior resolution in epitope identification. PROFILER seems ideally suited to streamline and guide rational antigen design, adjuvant selection, and quality control of newly produced vaccines. Furthermore, this method is also susceptible to find important applications in other fields covered by traditional quantitative serology.\n## Discussion\nWe show here that massively parallel sequencing can significantly empower the analysis of phage-displayed antigen-specific libraries during selection with serum antibodies. From a technical standpoint, our data confirm previous studies showing that next generation sequencing can improve the resolution of methods using phage or ribosome display libraries [19,20,21,22,23,24].

In this work, we constructed a cDNA library of single domain antibodies from a llama immunized with staphylococcal enterotoxin B. The resulting library was sequenced, resulting in approximately 8.5 million sequences with 5.4 million representing intact, useful sequences. The sequenced library was interrogated using sequences of known SEB-binding single domain antibodies from the library obtained through phage display panning methods in a previous study. New antibodies were identified, produced, and characterized, and were shown to have affinities and melting temperatures comparable to those obtained by traditional panning methods. This demonstrates the utility of using NGS as a complementary tool to phage-displayed biopanning as a means for rapidly obtaining additional antibodies from an immune library. It also shows that phage display, using a library of high diversity, is able to select high quality antibodies even when they are low in frequency.",

At present, SAROTUP has gathered a suite of tools for finding potential TUPs and other purposes. Besides the TUPScan, the motif-based tool, and three tools based on the BDB database, i.e., MimoScan, MimoSearch, and MimoBlast, three predictors based on support vector machine, i.e., PhD7Faster, SABinder and PSBinder, are integrated into SAROTUP. The current version of SAROTUP contains 27 TUP motifs and 823 TUP sequences. We also developed the standalone SAROTUP application with graphical user interface (GUI) and command line versions for processing deep sequencing phage display data and distributed it as an open source package, which can perform perfectly locally on almost all systems that support C++ with little or no modification. The web interfaces of SAROTUP have also been redesigned to be more self-evident and user-friendly. The latest version of SAROTUP is freely available at http://i.uestc.edu.cn/sarotup3.",

                    "text": "Phage display is a powerful in vitro selection technique, which enables the identification of high-affinity peptides or antibodies from libraries of phage particles displaying highly diverse peptides [1]. Libraries with a great variety of peptides are subject to one or more rounds of affinity selection, also called biopanning, which contains repetitive rounds of target-binding (selection) and proliferation [2]. The rapid isolation of ligands for a distinct target by biopanning has a wide range of applications extending from epitope determination [2,3], protein-protein interaction detection [4], to new vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics development [5][6][7]. \n\nAdditionally, the selection from phage-displayed libraries has been increasingly employed in the design of new chemicals [8] and the development of new materials [9]. \n\nIn recent years, next-generation sequencing (NGS) has substantially contributed to the analysis of phage-displayed screens [10][11][12][13][14][15]. In sharp contrast with traditional phage display, phage display selections powered by NGS can produce enormous data output and facilitate the finding of specific binders by avoiding iterative selections and restraining the number of false positive hits [11]. However, both classical phage display and next-generation phage display (NGPD) screens are deeply troubled by the emergence of target-unrelated peptides (TUPs). Derda et al. described and confirmed that selection from phage display libraries is driven by two independent pressures [10,16]: (1) the selection-related pressure which enriches for clones that bind to the desired target or non-target-related components (e.g., protein A/G, bead) of the biopanning system during the selection step [17]; (2) The proliferation-related pressure which enriches clones exhibiting faster proliferation abilities during the amplification step [18][19][20]. Hence, biopanning output is actually a mixture of true binders and TUPs.",

At present, SAROTUP has gathered a suite of tools for finding potential TUPs and other purposes. Besides the TUPScan, the motif-based tool, and three tools based on the BDB database, i.e., MimoScan, MimoSearch, and MimoBlast, three predictors based on support vector machine, i.e., PhD7Faster, SABinder and PSBinder, are integrated into SAROTUP. The current version of SAROTUP contains 27 TUP motifs and 823 TUP sequences. We also developed the standalone SAROTUP application with graphical user interface (GUI) and command line versions for processing deep sequencing phage display data and distributed it as an open source package, which can perform perfectly locally on almost all systems that support C++ with little or no modification. The web interfaces of SAROTUP have also been redesigned to be more self-evident and user-friendly. The latest version of SAROTUP is freely available at http://i.uestc.edu.cn/sarotup3.\n## Introduction\nPhage display is a powerful in vitro selection technique, which enables the identification of high-affinity peptides or antibodies from libraries of phage particles displaying highly diverse peptides [1]. Libraries with a great variety of peptides are subject to one or more rounds of affinity selection, also called biopanning, which contains repetitive rounds of target-binding (selection) and proliferation [2]. The rapid isolation of ligands for a distinct target by biopanning has a wide range of applications extending from epitope determination [2,3], protein-protein interaction detection [4], to new vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics development [5][6][7]. \n\nAdditionally, the selection from phage-displayed libraries has been increasingly employed in the design of new chemicals [8] and the development of new materials [9]. \n\nIn recent years, next-generation sequencing (NGS) has substantially contributed to the analysis of phage-displayed screens [10][11][12][13][14][15]. In sharp contrast with traditional phage display, phage display selections powered by NGS can produce enormous data output and facilitate the finding of specific binders by avoiding iterative selections and restraining the number of false positive hits [11]. However, both classical phage display and next-generation phage display (NGPD) screens are deeply troubled by the emergence of target-unrelated peptides (TUPs). Derda et al. described and confirmed that selection from phage display libraries is driven by two independent pressures [10,16]: (1) the selection-related pressure which enriches for clones that bind to the desired target or non-target-related components (e.g., protein A/G, bead) of the biopanning system during the selection step [17]; (2) The proliferation-related pressure which enriches clones exhibiting faster proliferation abilities during the amplification step [18][19][20]. Hence, biopanning output is actually a mixture of true binders and TUPs.",

Winter for the 'phage display of peptides and antibodies' in 2018. Phage display libraries are widely used to identify novel antigen-specific monoclonal antibodies and map the binding sites or epitopes of proteins or antibodies. Phage display technology has also emerged as a robust platform for drug discovery in biotechnology due to its ability to facilitate the efficient identification of antibodies in vitro (Nagano and Tsutsumi, 2021). This technology facilitates extensive applications in biomedical research, drug development, and bioengineering (Kim et al., 2011). \n\nOne key advancement that has greatly improved the efficiency and scalability of phage display technology is Oligonucleotide Library Synthesis (OLS). OLS allows for the high-throughput synthesis of numerous oligonucleotide sequences, which can then be used to create highly diverse peptide libraries. Phage Immunoprecipitation Sequencing (PhIP-Seq) is a technique derived from traditional phage display that utilizes OLS to encode peptide libraries. PhIP-Seq enables the efficient detection of antibodies on a large scale by employing a high-capacity phage display peptide library, antibody immunoprecipitation, and highthroughput sequencing (Mohan et al., 2018). This technique can detect antibodies against hundreds of thousands of peptides and provide a comprehensive mapping of antibody profiles, making it particularly advantageous in studying complex diseases or immune responses to large pathogen families. Moreover, its high multiplexing capability allows for the analysis of multiple samples simultaneously, significantly reducing the cost of DNA sequencing per sample and enabling the analysis of large sets of samples. With these aforementioned characteristics, PhIP-Seq facilitates the discovery of novel antibodies and enhances our understanding of the immune response. \n\nAs shown in Figure 1, In this review, we highlight the research progress of PhIP-Seq technology, encompassing the entire process from the library's design to the data analysis. We have also summarized current challenges and potential solutions for them. Furthermore, we explore prospective directions for future development in PhIP-Seq technology and its applications.",

It enables comprehensive analysis of individual antibody profiles. This technology shows great potential, particularly in exploring disease mechanisms and immune responses. Currently, PhIP-Seq has been successfully applied in various fields, such as the exploration of biomarkers for autoimmune diseases, vaccine development, and allergen detection. A variety of bioinformatics tools have facilitated the development of this process. However, PhIP-Seq technology still faces many challenges and has room for improvement. Here, we review the methods, applications, and challenges of PhIP-Seq and discuss its future directions in immunological research and clinical applications. With continuous progress and optimization, PhIP-Seq is expected to play an even more important role in future biomedical research, providing new ideas and methods for disease prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.\n## Introduction\nThe importance of phage display platforms was recognized with the awarding of the Nobel Prize to George P. Smith and Sir Gregory P. Winter for the 'phage display of peptides and antibodies' in 2018. Phage display libraries are widely used to identify novel antigen-specific monoclonal antibodies and map the binding sites or epitopes of proteins or antibodies. Phage display technology has also emerged as a robust platform for drug discovery in biotechnology due to its ability to facilitate the efficient identification of antibodies in vitro (Nagano and Tsutsumi, 2021). This technology facilitates extensive applications in biomedical research, drug development, and bioengineering (Kim et al., 2011). \n\nOne key advancement that has greatly improved the efficiency and scalability of phage display technology is Oligonucleotide Library Synthesis (OLS). OLS allows for the high-throughput synthesis of numerous oligonucleotide sequences, which can then be used to create highly diverse peptide libraries. Phage Immunoprecipitation Sequencing (PhIP-Seq) is a technique derived from traditional phage display that utilizes OLS to encode peptide libraries. PhIP-Seq enables the efficient detection of antibodies on a large scale by employing a high-capacity phage display peptide library, antibody immunoprecipitation, and highthroughput sequencing (Mohan et al., 2018). This technique can detect antibodies against hundreds of thousands of peptides and provide a comprehensive mapping of antibody profiles, making it particularly advantageous in studying complex diseases or immune responses to large pathogen families. Moreover, its high multiplexing capability allows for the analysis of multiple samples simultaneously, significantly reducing the cost of DNA sequencing per sample and enabling the analysis of large sets of samples. With these aforementioned characteristics, PhIP-Seq facilitates the discovery of novel antibodies and enhances our understanding of the immune response. \n\nAs shown in Figure 1, In this review, we highlight the research progress of PhIP-Seq technology, encompassing the entire process from the library's design to the data analysis. We have also summarized current challenges and potential solutions for them. Furthermore, we explore prospective directions for future development in PhIP-Seq technology and its applications.",

Moreover, with ongoing advances in sequencing technology, depth and read length is improving continuously: for instance, the PacBio Sequel system generates approximately seven times more sequences than the previous RS II system but maintains its long-read capability (Pacific Biosciences), while nanopore systems such as the MinIOn (Oxford Nanopore) offer the promise of real-time DNA sequencing in combination with ultra-long reads.

            "text": "NGS technologies have been used in combination with phage display in a number of applications. 24,25 While NGS allows in-depth analysis of phage display libraries, its widespread use has been hampered by limitations in read length 26,27 and signal integrity 16 of several sequencing technologies. These limitations have meant that most sequencing applications have only covered a single variable domain within a library, showing the greatest utility in the sequencing of single domain antibody libraries. 28,29 Yang and colleagues recently described the use of phage display data obtained using MiSeq sequencing to isolate antibodies from scFv libraries that had undergone multiple rounds of panning. The data sets obtained had high sequence depth and allowed generation of antibodies against the target antigen of interest; however, a key limitation to the method was the use of limited read length within the sequencing data that required additional PCR amplification to retrieve the full sequence of the clones. 30 Here, we used the PacBio sequencing platform combined with SMRTbell technology to generate highly accurate full-length scFv sequence repertoires from immune libraries selected through conventional phage display biopanning targeting the cell surface antigens CD160 and CD123. Mining these two independent libraries enabled the identification of a large and diverse panel of high-quality antibodies.\n\nHemadou et al. demonstrated that the combination of SMRT sequencing with circular consensus adapter ligation allowed the identification of full-length scFvs from an enriched phage display library. By tracking a manually selected clone, they identified its presence in the top 100 of the pool of reads and they were able to determine an accuracy of >99.9% for complete sequences of inserts approaching 1,000 bp. Although this supports the robustness of the combinatorial method, it does not give insights on the functionality and diversity of the scFvs contained in the phage library. 13 Similarly, Han and colleagues used this approach to investigate phage display libraries that had shown high clonality using traditional screening methods and, although they identified several new clones, they did not investigate the specificity and functionality of the phage display-selected antibodies. 14 In our study, we used long-read sequencing to expand the screening of selected phage display libraries.

            "text": "ABSTRACT Phage display technology in combination with next-generation sequencing (NGS) currently is a state-of-the-art method for the enrichment and isolation of monoclonal antibodies from diverse libraries. However, the current NGS methods employed for sequencing phage display libraries are limited by the short contiguous read lengths associated with second-generation sequencing platforms. Consequently, the identification of antibody sequences has conventionally been restricted to individual antibody domains or to the analysis of single domain binding moieties such as camelid VHH or cartilaginous fish IgNAR antibodies. In this study, we report the application of third-generation sequencing to address this limitation. We used single molecule real time (SMRT) sequencing coupled with hairpin adaptor loop ligation to facilitate the accurate interrogation of full-length single-chain Fv (scFv) libraries. Our method facilitated the rapid isolation and testing of scFv antibodies enriched from phage display libraries within days following panning. Two libraries against CD160 and CD123 were panned and monitored by NGS. Analysis of NGS antibody data sets led to the isolation of several functional scFv antibodies that were not identified by conventional panning and screening strategies. Our approach, which combines phage display selection of immune libraries with the full-length interrogation of scFv fragments, is an easy method to discover functional antibodies, with a range of affinities and biophysical characteristics.",

This combination not only provides additional knowledge on the antibody repertoire of immunized animals but greatly enhances the screening power of immune phage display libraries for the identification of functional and diverse scFv fragments. As 5% of the immunoglobulin repertoire in rodents expresses the lambda light chain, we have considered the kappa chain locus only. 31 We analyzed data from two immune libraries against CD160 and CD123 based on HCDR3 abundance within the enriched libraries, and selected clones either based on frequency or phylogenetic distance to allow the isolation of more diverse binders. An interesting observation was that not all clones enriched by phage display panning bound to target antigen, but we observed a success rate of 75% and 81% when we analyzed the most frequent clones prevalent after CD160 and CD123 selection, respectively. This strategy consists of conventional phage display biopanning followed by SMRT sequencing and open source NGS analysis to identify an expansive repertoire of antigen-specific antibody clones, with virtually no screening required. A disadvantage of the system deployed here, relative to second-generation systems such as the Illumina platform, is the far lower sequencing depth obtained. Typically yields of 80,000 reads for a 1 Kb sequence fragment can be generated, as compared to over 5 \u00d7 10 6 reads for Illumina Hiseq sequencing. Clearly, the read depths obtained in our experiments were insufficient to cover the theoretical diversity of a typical phage display library. It is possible to modify the sequencing protocol by sequencing the same prepared library on multiple SMRT cells of the sequencer. As library preparation and instrument run time are a substantial proportion of the sequencing cost, this approach could enable sequencing depth to be increased 10-fold with a modest increase in sequencing costs. For the purpose of this study and using an approach in which libraries are first enriched against target antigen, we surmise that depth of sequencing obtained in a single run is sufficient to sample our immune scFv phage display libraries, which typically have reduced diversity and clonal redundancy. This is clearly the case for libraries after multiple rounds of enrichment. However, for libraries on which limited enrichment have",

Phage display is a powerful and versatile technology for constructing a library of peptides or antibodies displayed on phage virions, and then screening them for peptides or antibodies with desired properties. In 2018, one-half of the Nobel Prize in chemistry was awarded jointly to George P. Smith and Sir Gregory P. Winter for the \"phage display of peptides and antibodies\" (Smith, 2019;Winter, 2019). Phage display has been widely used to map epitopes, identify drug targets (Takakusagi et al., 2020), and develop therapeutics, diagnostics, and vaccines. \n\nIn the present Research Topic, we have organized 11 articles, including seven original research papers, two method papers, and two reviews, to share the authors' understanding of the phage display technique and its applications from various angles. \n\nNext-generation sequencing (NGS) has been employed in most, if not all, fields of biology and medicine. Phage display is no exception, either for antibodies or peptides. Using the Roche 454 NGS platform, Lisowska et al. identified over 13,000 peptides targeting ubiquitin and over 10,000 peptides against ubiquitin-like modifier NEDD8 from the Ph.D.-12 Phage Display Peptide Library. Two peptides were further confirmed to inhibit both E3 ubiquitin ligases, MDM2 and CHIP, and their binding modes were solved by the NMR analysis. Zhao et al. made a phage panning scheme that separately covered selections against phosphotyrosine (pTyr) and sulfated tyrosine (sTyr) peptides, followed by NGS. After mining the NGS data and validating with experiments, they successfully identified some sTyr superbinders.

Inaccuracies in DNA sequencing such as substitutions, insertions and deletions in the library oligonucleotide region have the potential to result in the identification of erroneous candidate sequences. Here, we describe a Python Pipeline for Phage Analysis through a Normative Unified Toolset (P3ANUT) which employs Levenshtein distance, k-mer approaches and a novel encoding scheme on paired-end sequencing outputs to correct sequencing errors from next-generation sequencing outputs of display library screens. We introduce an easy-to-use and highly customisable computational tool with graphical user- and command line interfaces to process entire datasets within a single input, as well as visualisation tools for candidate analysis and data generation.

            "text": "Phage display, introduced in 1985 by George Smith [1], has been used extensively in the identification of novel ligands with potential applications in different research areas including, but not limited to, drug discovery [2], drug delivery [3], and molecular imaging [4]. In recent decades, combinatorial phage display libraries have raised growing attention for the translation of peptide-based diagnostics and therapeutics into the clinic. These libraries are constructed by in-frame cloning of random oligonucleotides into the surface protein gene of a bacteriophage, leading to the expression of a vast number of exogenous peptides as fusions to the corresponding surface protein. This links the phenotype to the genotype, allowing for sequencing of the relevant part of the phage genome to retrieve the displayed peptide sequence [5]. \n\nThe advent of phage display peptide libraries has enabled the high-throughput screening on a variety of important cellular and molecular targets [6][7][8][9][10]. Random peptide sequences expressed on the phage surface can interact with the target of interest and phages expressing peptides that bind specifically to the target can be isolated. Phage display screening, called biopanning, consists of iterative rounds in which the library is presented to the target of interest, and the selected phage pool is amplified by infection of Escherichia coli cells. The amplified phages serve as input for the subsequent round of biopanning [11]. Traditionally, biopanning outputs have been analyzed by Sanger sequencing. This sequencing approach can identify only a limited number of peptides in the library. Recent advances have combined phage display with next-generation sequencing (NGS), allowing for the sequencing of thousands to millions of peptide inserts in parallel [12][13][14]. This eliminates the laborious procedure of picking random clones and provides increased resolution of the biopanning output compared to Sanger sequencing. NGS allows researchers to analyze the composition of large peptide libraries on a deeper scale.",

            "text": "Many studies are continually developing methods to overcome these limitations and for high-throughput screening of display libraries. The link between the genotype (scFv coding sequence) and the phenotype (surface-displayed scFv) is the principle for the implementation of sequencing-guided screening of display libraries. Next-generation sequencing allows high-throughput interrogation of the selection steps to evaluate the relative enrichment of scFvs as indicative of their affinity for the target of interest, giving a far greater coverage compared to classical ELISA screening. This coverage also allows the identification of rare clones that, in some cases, can target sub-dominant epitopes with intriguing properties. Beyond the enrichment, high-throughput sequencing allows to discard a priori all those clones bearing non-valid inserts to restrict the analysis to potential binders. To further improve the confidence of binding prediction, we are implementing a database collecting predicted and validated binders to target-unrelated components of the biopanning. Refining the sequencing-guided screening, by applying these informatic scripts, grants dedicated wet step efforts to those scFvs with high-potential to be specific binders. Moreover, the characterization of these false-positive clones' sequences (target-unrelated and selection-unrelated), could lead to an increased understanding of how these clones arise to intervene in crucial selection steps for preventing or limiting this phenomenon. Although next-generation sequencing improved the quality of phage display, there are at least two key limitations: (1) the maximal read length of second-generation sequencing technologies (i.e., Illumina) allows to sequence only a portion of scFvs (e.g., VH), making the reconstruction of the entire antibody fragment challenging; (2) to physically fish out in silico-identified clones of interest, a laborious recovery step is necessary. Long reads obtainable from third-generation sequencing allow achieving quali-quantitative information of the entire scFvs. Not long ago, the relatively low-throughput, the high error rate, and the cost limited the exploitation of third-generation sequencing in display technologies. The circular consensus reads that the more widespread platforms' availability is making this paradigm shift overcome challenges with the higher sequencing error rate, and also leads to a reduction in sequencing costs [65].",

Here, we compare nine phage display antibody libraries published in the last decade, which represent the state of the art in the discovery and development of therapeutic antibodies using phage display. We first discuss the quality of the libraries and the diverse types of antibody repertoires used as substrates to build the libraries, i.e., na\u00efve, synthetic, and semisynthetic. Second, we review the performance of the libraries in terms of the number of positive clones per panning, hit rate, affinity, and developability of the selected antibodies.

            "text": "Display technologies, such as phage, yeast and ribosome display are important tools in the identification of therapeutic antibodies. 1 In particular, phage display is widely used at several stages of the drug discovery process. Phage library diversity can be derived from na\u00efve human B cells, 2 synthetic engineered antibody sequences 3 or from B cell-rich tissue of immunized animals; 4 libraries generated by the latter method are often referred to as immune phage display libraries. Immune phage display offers several advantages over na\u00efve or synthetic display approaches, increasing the likelihood of isolating stable, high-affinity specific antibodies due to pre-enrichment and in-vivo affinity maturation. 5 Traditional isolation of antibodies from phage display libraries involves multiple rounds of panning followed by screening and sequencing of positive clones. A key limitation when identifying clones is the screening step following enrichment. Selecting clones can be technically challenging and time consuming, and the process is often hampered by dominant clones within the enriched population, which makes it difficult to identify alternative binders with lower representation within the pool.\n\nDespite recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, sequence read length is a limitation in their application to phage display screening. The majority of NGS platform technologies allow a maximum read length of up to 500 base pair (bp), 6 which has extensively been used for the analysis of immunoglobulin (Ig)-repertoires in several species. This length, however, is not sufficient to cover a full singlechain variable fragment (scFv) sequences. 7,8 Currently, sequencing of the entire variable heavy (VH) and variable light (VL) fragment of a single chain is not routinely carried out and is not possible using conventional NGS platforms. Single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing allows the contiguous sequencing of fragments of up to 8500 bp, 9 but read length comes at the expense of sequence fidelity. 10 A recent advance in SMRT sequencing is the addition of hairpin loops to double-stranded DNA fragments. 11 Consensus sequencing of adaptor ligated fragments can increase the sequence accuracy of an 850 bp fragment (the approximate length of an average scFv) to 99.99%. 12 Hemadou et al. first demonstrated this approach to be effective at accurately identifying full-length scFvs in an enriched fully human,",

            "text": "In the last decades, numerous combinatorial methodologies for the selection and screening of proteins were developed, which mimic natural evolutionary processes in vitro and aim at detecting interaction partners with specific chemical and/or physical properties. Among these, surface display technologies play a central role and besides bacterial, ribosomal, yeast and other screening methods, phage display is by far the most widespread application for screening of protein interaction partners or selecting antibodies for diagnostic and therapeutic applications [76]. \n\nWith the latest developments discussed here, the presentation of cDNA and ORF expression products on phage has become not only possible, but led to an increase in library quality, produced indepth analysis of the enrichment process, became faster, more convenient and reasonably priced. Thus the application of this approach and variations thereof will increase constantly in the future. Most application areas described in this review centre around the identification of novel allergens, potential biomarkers in autoimmune disorders [43,77], cancer [78,79] or vaccine development [80]. However, additional fields of application, such as screening for cellular targets of toxic chemical compounds emerge [81]. \n\nThe next level of phage display will indisputably see the implementation of NGS into automation strategies for screening of combinatorial libraries [82]. The application of semi-automated selection strategies, such as developed in our laboratory [83,84] not only allows the reduction of variability and increased reproducibility of the selection protocol, but can be readily implemented in process pipelines based on unit-automation [85,86]. Such pipelines, in turn, can be easily extended to include NGS as a sophisticated analysis tool of the selection outcome. \n\nTwenty-five years after its introduction, phage display persists to be the most popular and successful surface display application with more than 4,000 entries in PubMed. With the latest developments in library design and the combination of phage display with high-throughput selection pipelines and next generation sequencing, the field has become as vibrant as ever.",

            "text": "The use of phage-display antibody combinatorial libraries has impulsed the isolation of innovative antibodies. Approximately 30% of the approved antibodies for clinical treatments in the last 5 years were isolated from phage-displayed libraries using different selection strategies. 1 Originally, the validation of selected clones was based on either the enrichment of specific clones throughout the selection rounds 2 or biological activities of some (few) randomly selected clones. 3 However, the low throughput of Sanger sequencing limited these strategies, as enriched clones were assessed from few sequences, or activityscreened clones (antigen binding, for example). Thirty years after the pioneering work describing the phase-display technique, 4 new methodologies such as next-generation sequencing (NGS) have pushed the technology toward modern standards for selecting biologically active selected clones. \n\nThe development of NGS increased in several orders of magnitude the quantity of individual clone sequences obtained, allowing the determination of complete variable domain repertoires. As a consequence, NGS sequencing became the preferred strategy to determine antibody phage clones that were successfully selected in phage-display experiments. 5 7][8] Some methods focus on the VH complementarity-determining region-3 (CDR3) to address the diversity of phage libraries. 9,10 The role of CDR3 in antigen (Ag) recognition and binding is noteworthy, but other regions (CDR1 or 2, and even some framework residues) have also been described as crucial in some antibodyantigen interactions. Thus, novel approaches addressing the whole sequence may be more indicated to find reliable highaffinity antibody domains. \n\nIn this work, we describe a new workflow-AutomaTed Tool For Immunoglobulin Analysis (ATTILA)-that makes it possible to identify variable domains enriched after selection. The methodology combines the generation of VH and VL amplicons from antibody-displaying phages, before and after selection, and the use of NGS to acquire their coding sequences. After a filtering process, ATTILA can establish the frequency of each variable domain sequence in a given selection round. It generates a report with the fold change of each enriched sequence, giving the amino acid sequence, complementaritydetermining region (CDR) identification, and germline classification of the variable domains.",

            "title": "Development, High-Throughput Profiling, and Biopanning of a Large Phage Display Single-Domain Antibody Library",
            "text": "The antibody display system includes the phage display, yeast display, bacterial surface display, and ribosome display [28][29][30]. Among these systems, a phage display antibody library is a collection of diverse antibody fragments genetically fused to coat proteins on the surface of bacteriophages, allowing for the display of a wide range of antibodies [31][32][33][34]. It serves as a versatile and widely used tool for engineering antibodies and drug discovery [35]. The diversity of the library plays a pivotal role in isolating antibodies with high specificity for a given target using phage display technology. In mammals, V(D)J recombination is a key process that contributes to the diversification of the B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire, which is capable of recognizing a wide range of antigens [36]. Additionally, random nucleotide deletions or insertions at the junction regions of gene segments contribute to the final diversity of the BCR repertoire [37]. For na\u00efve libraries constructed without any process of immunization, the theoretical diversity increases with the number of initially collected lymphocytes, enriching a more extensive range of potential binding specificities. Although it has been reported that a single donor is sufficient to produce a highly functional antibody library, recent studies of the B cell repertoire have suggested that individuals possess a unique immune system and do not extensively share common B cell clonotypes [20,38]. Hence, multiple donors' blood samples are beneficial for expanding the antibody library's repertoire. Therefore, we assumed that the construction of phage display libraries using numerous lymphocytes collected from an increased number of different donors would enhance the diversity of the library, leading to the rapid discovery of diverse high-quality antibodies. \n\nNext-generation sequencing (NGS), also known as high-throughput sequencing, is an emerging technology for rapidly sequencing DNA fragments in large-scale experiments [39]. In contrast to the traditional Sanger sequencing method, which has limitations, such as intensive labor, high cost, and the limited throughput of the number of DNA types that can be decoded at once, this high-throughput capability is especially valuable for the characterization and assessment of the quality of antibody libraries [40,41].",

            "text": "We show here that massively parallel sequencing can significantly empower the analysis of phage-displayed antigen-specific libraries during selection with serum antibodies. From a technical standpoint, our data confirm previous studies showing that next generation sequencing can improve the resolution of methods using phage or ribosome display libraries [19,20,21,22,23,24]. However, while most of these studies focused on the discovery of peptide [19,20,21,24] and antibody [22] ligands for various targets, the present report deals with the identification of the antigen regions preferentially targeted by polyclonal responses. Moreover, our library, as well as the one used by Larman et al. [23], contained sequences obtained from natural repertories, while most of the studies cited above used random peptides libraries, whose results are sometimes difficult to interpret particularly when used in conjunction with polyclonal sera. We believe that, particularly for our application and the one described by Larman et al. [23], the use of next generation sequencing may be instrumental not only in increasing the resolution of the assay, but also in moving it from research to clinical laboratories. In this respect, the PROFILER technology, seems amenable to applications in all fields of serology, including the diagnosis of infectious, autoimmune and neoplastic diseases. Serology has been traditionally concerned with determining the amount of antibodies directed against a chosen antigen. We show here that -by combining the versatility of phage display with the power of next generation sequencing -it is also possible to obtain, in a time frame close to that of traditional serological techniques (i.e. within two days), precise qualitative and quantitative information about the regions of the antigen molecule that are targeted by a serum antibody response. Clearly, future studies will be needed to ascertain whether PROFILER will be useful in diagnostic testing and whether specific immunodominance patterns can be linked to well-defined pathologic features or to vaccine efficacy. \n\nThere is a great need, in vaccine research and diagnostic medicine, for rapid and simple methods to identify B cell epitopes [25]. Moreover, epitope characterization is important in the context of drug design [26].",

            "text": "Data presented here indicate that the combined use of genespecific libraries and deep sequencing, as exemplified by the PROFILER technology, can significantly empower phage display-based epitope mapping methods and usefully complement the results of more sophisticated techniques, such as HDX-MS. In this respect, our results are in general agreement with those obtained with other methods based on next-generation sequencing of surface-displayed libraries, including phage, 18,19 yeast, 20 or ribosome 21 display. S1. Our previous experience has indicated that lambda phage systems, such as the one employed in the PROFILER technology, can be used to efficiently display fragments of a wider variety of antigens compared with the more commonly used filamentous phage display systems. 12,13,22 Since filamentous phage assembly occurs at or within the membrane of Escherichia coli, residues inhibiting proper protein insertion into this membrane may block the assembly and extrusion of phage particles, thereby preventing the display of the corresponding proteins. On the other hand, the capsid of lytic bacteriophages, such as lambda, is assembled in the cytoplasm of bacteria, and the display of fusion proteins does not depend on their ability to translocate across the membrane. Moreover, lambda phages also show an increased ability, over filamentous phages, to display proteins or peptides that may be toxic to the cell. 23 Nevertheless, since any display system has drawbacks, in addition to advantages, it cannot be excluded from our data that some proteins might be less efficiently displayed on lambda phages than the NadA antigen used in this study. \n\nThe selection conditions (including the number of selection rounds) utilized here were chosen to provide the most informative phage pools in terms of their complexity and sequence variability. This, in conjunction with the ability of PROFILER to analyze thousands of different fragments for their degree of antibody-mediated enrichment, allowed the identification of a wider variety of affinity-selected polypeptides, compared with conventional techniques. For example, traditional immunoscreening was unable to identify the shorter and less immunoreactive fragments contained in the affinity-selected library. These shorter sequences are often useful in epitope mapping to identify structures that are still sufficient for antibody binding.",

            "text": "Phage display is a widely used technology for generating, identifying and engineering fully human antibodies, and it has delivered numerous antibodies for research and clinical applications (1). A typical antibody phage display experiment consists of three major steps: (i) generation and display of an antibody library, such as antigen-binding fragment (Fab) library or single-chain variable fragment (scFv) library; (ii) enrichment of antigen-binding antibodies by multiple rounds of binding selection and amplification and (iii) recovery of antigen-specific antibodies from phage selection pools (2). Sanger sequencing is commonly used at each of these steps to decode sequences of antibody fragments recovered from phage pools. It requires the isolation of individual phagemids from phage pools and is practically limited to sequencing a few hundred clones routinely. Since each selection round in phage display gives an output of up to \u223c10 6 sequences, the use of next-generation sequencing (NGS) becomes necessary if one must capture and interrogate the entire sequence diversity present in phage selection outputs. With NGS, entire phage pools can be subjected to sequencing (isolation of individual phagemids is not required) and \u223c10 6 -10 9 sequences can be readily obtained (3,4). Up to ten NGS platforms exist, each with its own advantages and preferred applications, with primary variables being read length, data quality and quantity, time and cost (5,6). Three commonly used NGS platforms in the antibody field include 454 (Roche), MiSeq (Illumina) and Ion Torrent (Life Technologies).\n\nThe Fischer lab was the first to use NGS in antibody phage display (2). They used the Illumina platform to sequence the complementarity-determining region H3 (CDRH3) from a multiple-framework synthetic scFv li-brary. NGS analysis was used to assess the quality of the library and to follow changes in heavy chain germline usage and CDRH3 length distribution over three rounds of selection. They also developed a strategy to rescue rare scFv clones from phage pools using fragment assembly (2). The Fischer lab used the same approach to sequence the CDRH3 region of semi-synthetic scFv libraries and to rescue rare scFv clones from ph",

            "text": "Polypeptide molecules are displayed on the surface of filamentous bacteriophage typically by fusion to either the major (G8P) or minor (G3P) coat protein, and probed for interaction with target ligand in a process called biopanning [1]. The major power of phage display technology resides in the huge number of phage particles (>10 13 ), which is amenable to selection. A large pool of variants, typically in the range of 10 7 to 10 9 independent clones, is redundantly represented, enabling efficient probing of the total sequence space of the library. A recent add-on to the phage display technology is the implementation of deep sequencing to investigate the library diversity. Deep sequencing (e.g., Illumina sequencing) allows for comprehensive screening of selected clones in contrast to conventional screening by ELISA and Sanger sequencing [2,3]. Indeed, since deep sequencing platforms readily provide large numbers (>10 6 ) of short (100 to 400 bp) sequence reads with high accuracy [4], significantly larger fractions of the phage population can be mapped, providing more detailed insights into library complexity and enrichment. For example, deep sequencing has enhanced the understanding of various immunologic repertoires from zebrafish [5] and human heavy and light chain repertoires from isolated naive [6] and antigen-specific B-cells [7], T-cell receptors [8] and antibody display repertoires [9]. However, one limitation of high-throughput sequencing is the size of the encoded genes to be verified. Since commonly used antibody fragment formats (e.g., scFv and Fab) are usually larger than 700 bp [10], most current sequencing platforms only cover a fraction of the coding sequence (the mutagenized variable regions), meaning sequences outside the target region (constant regions, vector elements) often remain unverified. \n\nDespite the power and robustness of the display technology, certain parameters can interfere with the selection-amplification procedure. First, since protein-displaying phage are assembled at the inner membrane of the bacterial host cells, proper translocation to the periplasmic space and folding of the coat protein fusion are crucial.",

In this report, we produced three types of small tetrapeptide libraries that have a maximum diversity of 10 5 -10 6 , which is easily accessible to routine Illumina sequencing and data processing: (i) an N-terminally displayed library with the sequence Ser-X-Cys-XXX-Cys, where X is any one of 19 trinucleotide codons (\"allowed\" codons, cysteine excluded), termed NT-TriNuc 43 ; (ii) an N-terminally displayed library encoded by conventional NNK randomization with the sequence Ser-XXXX, termed NT-SX4 44 ; (iii) a library encoded by NNK randomization and expressed between N1 and N2 domains of phage coat protein pIII, termed ID-SX4 45 . We also developed a paired-end processing program tailored for the analysis of phage-displayed libraries. NT-TriNuc and NT-SX4 libraries were characterized by paired-end deep sequencing at every step of library production. Although paired-end processing pipelines are common in the literature, we sought to build on published concepts 22,46 and re-implement the processing as an open-source MATLAB code. To track mutations caused by PCR, we used the Primer ID technology on the synthetic NT-TriNuc library. In addition, we also characterized biases arising from chemical post-translational modification (cPTM) through N-terminal oxime ligation 12,47 and dichloro-oxime-mediated cyclization 11,12 .",

            "text": "Phage display is an antibody discovery tool that screens bacteriophage presenting a library of variable antibody domains against a target antigen. Through multiple rounds of incubation with the target, washing away unbound phage, and amplifying bound phage, the library is reduced to those clones with affinity and specificity to the antigen. 1,2 Individual clones can be selected or screened from this sublibrary and converted into an IgG format for use as diagnostic or therapeutic reagents.\n\nThough effective, traditional phage display suffers from key limitations. Conventionally, >5 rounds of selection are required to generate clones with high affinity to the target. The cost and time requirements of repeat rounds (approximately 6\u22128 weeks and $8,000\u221210,000 USD in total) are a bottleneck in the discovery of new therapeutics. 3,4 The difficulty in controlling stringency during binding causes many candidates from the enriched phage pools to represent false positives that fail in vitro validation. 5,6 An inability to recapitulate the low relative concentration and morphology of targets in vitro may also lead to candidates failing later during in vivo testing. 7 The stochastic nature of selection results in thousands of nonspecific clones, requiring further screening for elimination. Further, variations in the efficiency of bacterial amplification result in candidates being missed due to low representation. 8, 9 To address these issues, variations of the phage display approach have been developed. These include performing selection with antigens presented on a cell surface 10 and with mixed cell types, 11 incorporating microfluidics to control the binding dynamics, 12,13 and using next-generation sequencing (NGS) and bioinformatics analysis to choose clones for validation, to further library design, 14 or to eliminate nonspecific clones. 15 Although the feasibility of these approaches has been explored, a comprehensive platform combining these novel features to produce high-performing antibodies in a reduced number of rounds against a challenging therapeutic target has yet to be demonstrated.\n\nIn this paper, we present such a platform: \u03bcCellect.

In this work, we developed an NGS-assisted antibody discovery platform by integrating phage-displayed, single-framework, synthetic Fab libraries. Due to limitations in attainable read and amplicon lengths, NGS analysis of Fab libraries and selection outputs is usually restricted to either VH or VL. Since this information alone is not sufficient for high-throughput reconstruction of Fabs, we developed a rapid and simple method for linking and sequencing all diversified CDRs in phage Fab pools. Our method resulted in a reliable and straightforward platform for converting NGS information into Fab clones. We used our NGS-assisted Fab reconstruction method to recover low-frequency rare clones from phage selection outputs. While previous studies chose rare clones for rescue based on their relative frequencies in sequencing outputs, we chose rare clones for reconstruction from less-frequent CDRH3 lengths. In some cases, reconstructed rare clones (frequency \u223c0.1%) showed higher affinity and better specificity than high-frequency top clones identified by Sanger sequencing, highlighting the significance of NGS-based approaches in synthetic antibody discovery.",

            "text": "Background To develop efficient selection strategies and improve the discovery of promising ligands, it is highly desirable to analyze the sequence composition of na\u00efve phage display libraries and monitor the evolution of their peptide content during successive rounds of amplification. In the current study, we performed a comparative analysis of the compositional features in different lots of the same na\u00efve phage display library and monitored alterations in their peptide compositions during three rounds of amplification. Methods We conducted three rounds of duplicate serial amplification of two different lots of the Ph.D.\u2122-12 phage display library. DNA from the samples was subjected to Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) using an Illumina platform. The NGS datasets underwent a variety of bioinformatic analyses using Python and MATLAB scripts. Results We observed substantial heterogeneity in the sequence composition of the two lots indicated by differences in the enhanced percentage of wildtype clones, reduced diversity (number of unique sequences), and increased enrichment factors (EFs) during amplification as well as by observing no common sequence between lots and decreased number of common sequences between the na\u00efve library and the consecutive rounds of amplification for each lot. We also found potential propagation-related target-unrelated peptides (TUPs) with the highest EFs in the two lots, which were displayed by the fastest-propagating phage clones. Furthermore, motif analysis of the most enriched subpopulation of amplified libraries led to the identification of some motifs hypothesized to contribute to the increased amplification rates of the respective phage clones. Conclusion Our results highlight tremendous heterogeneity in the peptide composition of different lots of the same type of na\u00efve phage display library, and the divergent evolution of their compositional features during amplification rounds at the amino acid, peptide, and motif levels. Our findings can be instrumental for phage display researchers by bringing fundamental insights into the vast extent of non-uniformity between phage display libraries and by providing a clear picture of how these discrepancies can lead to different evolutionary fates for the peptide composition of phage pools, which can have profound impacts on the outcome of phage display selections through biopanning.

            "text": "The major challenge is isolating target-specific VHH antibodies through conventional screening of phage libraries, using phage ELISA or phage-binding analysis. Conventional screening requires the use of thousands of library clones and generates a monoclonal phage for binding analysis, which is very laborious, time-consuming, and expensive [17]. In addition, hetero-immunized library genes could be stimulated by multiple responses, due to shared antigenic determinants, with multiple VHH antibodies [18]. To isolate mono-specific antibodies, comparative binding analysis is necessary. Therefore, we searched for an alternative antibody screening strategy and found that a high-throughput sequencing-based strategy is an ideal approach for screening antibody candidates from a diverse gene library using machine-learning informatics. High-throughput sequencing via next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a powerful tool for analyzing a large number of DNA sequences with many evolutionary aspects of phage libraries within a short time frame, including the identification of unique and/or low-frequency rare clones that could be missed by conventional isolation techniques [14,19,20]. In principle, NGS-generated reads are used to determine the enrichment folds of each sequence by comparing them before and after panning of the phage library. High amplification folds indicated that the number of identified reads had increased compared to the number in the previous selection rounds. Diversified NGS-generated sequences can be grouped according to evolutionary relationships by a phylogenetic tree that provides a highly homologous cluster of genes derived from one or a group of species [21,22]. The phylogenetic tree-generated cluster would contain homologous character populations that share a recent common ancestor. Based on this principle, we searched monoclonal VHH antibodies from multiple tumor cells immunized phage display library. \n\nIn the current study, we aimed to develop a tumor-specific VHH antibody screening method to screen multiple tumor cell-immunized libraries, using high-throughput sequencing, which will help us to identify antibody candidates.",

            "text": "Currently, literature routinely reports on libraries of up to 10 10 unique sequences [4]. In reality, when biopanning, perfect sequence coverage is hardly ever reached. As library complexity increases and larger randomized stretches are expressed, complete library exploration becomes difficult to achieve due to practical limitations, as scientists would rapidly be dealing with volumes and cell numbers unfeasible for even industrial scale laboratories. However, it has been observed by Munoz and Deem that higher affinity antibodies are found through exploration of large high complexity libraries with lower sequence coverage, rather than thorough exploration of low complexity libraries with high sequence coverage [23]. This suggests efforts should be poured into increasing library sequence length (up to a reasonable limit) rather than ensuring that statistically all sequences should be present in a screen, paying the price of reduced sequence length. A critical aspect of sparse exploration of high complexity libraries is that the expressed sequences must be truly random and not skewed to one area of library space. A typical source of skew of a phage display library is enrichment or under-representation of DNA bases at certain positions in the sequence. In a truly randomized library there should be no enrichment for bases globally or at specific positions [24]. This is an important aspect which is not routinely checked in phage display workflows. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a powerful tool which can be used to read sequences contained within a sample of a phage display library, typically reporting in the order of 10 6 sequences. It is critical to note that this random sample containing a fraction of the phage display library is assumed to be representative of the entire library [25]. This sample of the library population does however contain enough information to profile DNA base and peptide residue propensities at each position which could be used to ensure the absence of skew in DNA base distribution. \n\nDuring our work developing new aspects of phage display technologies, we found no available software which could check and report on potential sources of skew present in NGS reads of phage display libraries. Whilst a multitude of software (commercial and open source) is available to assess the read accuracy of NGS runs, quantifying the accuracy of sequences recovered, no program was available for the task of ensuring that randomized stretches of phage display libraries were truly random.",

            "text": "For over two decades, phage display has been used to identify relevant protein interaction and recognition sites in receptorligand and antigen-antibody binding systems. Because of the strong predictive value of functional relationships revealed by specific protein interactions, peptide-protein or antibody-antigen pairs selected from phage display libraries serve as potential reagents in a vast range of biomedical and translational applications [1][2][3][4]. \n\nA conventional phage display selection typically starts with exposure of a library to targets of interest in vitro or in vivo. After the unbound and non-specific binding populations are removed, the remaining phage particles are recovered by infection and amplification in host bacteria growing in medium under either a selective genetic pressure (such as antibiotic resistance) or a differential identifying color scheme. Host bacteria allow viral multiplication and generate thousands of newly-formed phage particles. Upon plating of the host bacteria, lysogenic phage (i.e., non-lytic M13-derived) yields bacterial colonies whereas lytic phage (i.e., Lambda-derived) generates plaques in a bacterial lawn; each resulting bacterial colony or phage plaque is considered a transducing-unit (TU). Amplified phage populations serve for additional selection round(s) and allow enrichment of selective clones, which may be determined by comparing unselected to selected libraries through DNA sequencing [1][2][3][4]. Thus, the two most labor-and cost-intensive steps in phage display selection are (i) the counting of transducing units and (ii) the phage DNA sequencing (from each individual colony or plaque) to determine the corresponding peptide sequence of the encoded ligand(s). This straightforward, if cumbersome, approach has long provided biomedical findings of value; however, new large-scale technologies for DNA quantification and sequencing can potentially overcome some of the practical limitations of the conventional methodology for phage display selection. \n\nTo address this prospect, we have adapted emerging genomic methodologies to eliminate these two rate-limiting steps: we used real-time PCR for rapid TU quantification and next-generation sequencing for large-scale analysis.",

Based on this concept, NGS was adopted for the screening of antibody libraries to identify potential binders by monitoring the enrichment of a given sequence during the selection cycles [55]. Parallel comparative screenings of antibody libraries by traditional ELISA and NGS have demonstrated that, beyond top-ranking clones efficiently identified by both technologies, deep sequencing enables the discovery of many more specific binders among rare clones with potentially interesting features [38,56]. \n\nELISA and NGS have demonstrated that, beyond top-ranking clones efficiently identified by both technologies, deep sequencing enables the discovery of many more specific binders among rare clones with potentially interesting features [38,56].

            "text": "In this study, we address the two least efficient steps of phage display library selection: quantification and analysis of the displayed ligands. We introduce an integrated, robust, and readily available set of DNA-based molecular tools that will markedly improve combinatorial analysis in vitro and in vivo, and at an extremely low cost in labor and time. \n\nPhage library quantification is currently scored through phage infection of host bacteria, serial dilution, and TU-counting (i.e., individual colony or plaque). In this process, phage recovery and library titer depend on a number of factors such as peptide-target affinity, bacterial toxicity of encoded peptides, viability of phage after panning and particle recovery, as well as inherent infection and replication properties of targeted phage clones. Indeed, certain phage encoded-peptide sequences may be non-accurately represented due to preferences in the bacteria codon-usage. Notably, molecular events of host binding, entry, and infection rates depend on the number of ligands displayed and on the nature of the hybrid fusion partner; these currently unquantifiable factors could affect infection and replication capabilities of particular phage clones and might influence the prospect of uncovering rare ligands and/or the true library size. Suggested methods, developed to overcome some of these technical challenges include bacterial infection-independent procedures, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with antibodies that bind specifically to the phage coat [24] and/or phage-DNA-based approaches such as quantitative-PCR [25][26]. However, biochemical approaches clearly still lack the required sensitivity when phage titers are low. Moreover, the concept of ''high-throughput'' pyrosequencing of phage display libraries has now evolved from a very complex  protocol that yielded merely ,10 2 amplicons [27][28] to a far easier technique that enables the sequencing of 10 6 amplicons as presented here. Finally, quantitative-PCR plus next-generation sequencing methodologies have not as yet been systematically compared to TU-counting plus Sanger sequencing in terms of speed, cost, and--most importantly--accuracy.",

            "text": "Background Combinatorial phage display has been used in the last 20 years in the identification of protein-ligands and protein-protein interactions, uncovering relevant molecular recognition events. Rate-limiting steps of combinatorial phage display library selection are (i) the counting of transducing units and (ii) the sequencing of the encoded displayed ligands. Here, we adapted emerging genomic technologies to minimize such challenges. Methodology/Principal Findings We gained efficiency by applying in tandem real-time PCR for rapid quantification to enable bacteria-free phage display library screening, and added phage DNA next-generation sequencing for large-scale ligand analysis, reporting a fully integrated set of high-throughput quantitative and analytical tools. The approach is far less labor-intensive and allows rigorous quantification; for medical applications, including selections in patients, it also represents an advance for quantitative distribution analysis and ligand identification of hundreds of thousands of targeted particles from patient-derived biopsy or autopsy in a longer timeframe post library administration. Additional advantages over current methods include increased sensitivity, less variability, enhanced linearity, scalability, and accuracy at much lower cost. Sequences obtained by qPhage plus pyrosequencing were similar to a dataset produced from conventional Sanger-sequenced transducing-units (TU), with no biases due to GC content, codon usage, and amino acid or peptide frequency. These tools allow phage display selection and ligand analysis at >1,000-fold faster rate, and reduce costs \u223c250-fold for generating 106 ligand sequences. Conclusions/Significance Our analyses demonstrates that whereas this approach correlates with the traditional colony-counting, it is also capable of a much larger sampling, allowing a faster, less expensive, more accurate and consistent analysis of phage enrichment. Overall, qPhage plus pyrosequencing is superior to TU-counting plus Sanger sequencing and is proposed as the method of choice over a broad range of phage display applications in vitro, in cells, and in vivo.",

Our work provides insights into the limitations of lower throughput NGS. Compared to the traditional approach of Sanger sequencing, high-throughput sequencing strategies yield more valuable data on the compositional analysis of peptide pools. However, phage display researchers should be aware of the drawbacks of NGS platforms with lower depth, and the influence they might have on the analysis of phage display data. Lower sequencing depth can bear misleading information about the quality of unselected libraries and composition of biopanning outputs, which has substantial potential to misdirect further characterization of the in vitro selected peptides and final interpretations of phage display selection studies. We, therefore, recommend that phage display researchers thoroughly evaluate their experimental setup and draw particular attention to the constraints of the selected sequencing depth.",

            "text": "The development of antibody display technology such as phage (1), ribosome (2), yeast (3), and mammalian display (4) has enabled the rapid selection of binders from diverse libraries. These technologies bypass the use of animals and allow for the enrichment of binders within days to weeks. The power of in vitro selection technologies relies on a direct physical link between phenotype (displayed antibody construct) and genotype (antibody variable domain genes), allowing for the identification of binders through sequencing of their encoding genes. Multiple rounds of selection are generally required to identify antigen-specific binders, either by binding to a solid support or through cellular sorting (5). In many cases, later rounds of selections tend to be dominated by a handful of clones, which are then further characterized for affinity. Such clonal dominance can reflect genuine selection for high antigen affinity but might also reflect other properties such as superior expression or display. Consequently, clones with superior affinity may be present at low frequency and may not be readily detectable using traditional screening methods such as ELISA (6). \n\nRecent advances in DNA sequencing technologies and computing power over the last decade has led to a dramatic reduction in the cost of sequencing and has simplified data analyses (7). Although initially developed for genomics applications, such as whole-genome sequencing, transcriptome sequencing, and epigenetics, next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology is now increasingly being applied other fields, including to basic and applied immunology. This includes the sequencing of the paired human heavy and light chain repertoire from isolated na\u00efve (8,9) and antigen-specific B-cells (10,11), as well as T-cell receptor (12) and antibody display repertoires (13). While most NGS platforms were originally designed for short reads, technology is evolving rapidly, extending both read length and depth. Here, we review recent advances in NGS technology and key applications to phage display and other in vitro selection technologies.",

Here we propose a workflow for sequence enrichment analysis after phage-display library panning, based on simple frequency changes. The ATTILA workflow is freely available at GitHub. The use of NGS for the identification of selected phage clones led to the proposal of some, but few automatic workflows. REceptor LIgand Contacts (RELIC) 18 was one of the first software for phage-display analysis, and it enables users to align sequences and find motifs from phage-display experimental results. At present, it is limited by biases associated with the original phage-display technique. MIMOP 19 integrates 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional analyses to predict potential epitopic regions, respectively, performed by MimAlign and MimCons programs. SLiMFinder 20 is a probabilistic method to identify short linear motifs (SLiMs) with a very high level of specificity and a low false discovery rate. It can be applied to solve many problems in this domain, including phage-display library peptides. VDJFasta 6 uses Hide Markov Models to analyze antibody variable domain repertoires. N2GSAb 21 is a tool focused on HCDR3 to find entire clones using a smarty PCR strategy that uses an elegant approach to derive phage clones. However, high-affinity antibodies contain uniquely mutated variable domains that account not only for affinity but also for selectivity and bona fide structural features, both equally important if the aim is to obtain clinical Abs. These subtle amino acid residues' substitution may be lost as a consequence of clonal skewing or CDR3 centered analysis. ImmuneDB 8 both stores and analyzes NGS immune receptor sequencing data by aggregating tools to process raw reads for gene usage, infer clones, aggregate data, and run downstream analyses.

            "text": "Next-generation sequencing using 454 or Illumina technologies is powerful in covering the totality of the metasecretome library inserts. However, due to the short lengths of templates required for these sequencing technologies and a PCR amplification step that is necessary in order to produce the sequencing library, sequence information is disconnected from the physical recombinant clones from which it was derived (Ciric et al., 2014), making it impossible to form a clone library without the standard Sanger sequencing. This issue, however, can be overcome by using novel sequencing technologies, like PACBio, which use long templates (Fichot and Norman, 2013;Wang et al., 2015) and could, in principle, be used in an approach that would allow tracking of a sequence to the template. This approach for sequencing could be combined with subtractive or normalization methods to enrich the library for the rare recombinant sequences (Gagic et al., 2015), and to build a balanced metasecretome clone bank that can be used as a resource for expression and purification of large number of secretome proteins from a microbial community, by virtue of their display on PPs. \n\nA shot-gun metagenomic phage display libraries in Ff and T7 have potential to provide the widest possible coverage of SecYEG-dependent and -independent secretome proteins for affinity selection against complex or simple targets of interest to identify adhesins, secreted virulence factors or enzymes, whereas the metasecretome libraries provide a good source of data for large scale identification of immunogenic peptides. Amenability of phage display to large-scale, highthroughput screening using NGS and emerging phage display-based methods for enrichment of target genes in metagenomes, indicate that this is just a beginning of wider use of phage display to accelerate target gene discovery in metagenomics.",

In this work, we constructed a cDNA library of single domain antibodies from a llama immunized with staphylococcal enterotoxin B. The resulting library was sequenced, resulting in approximately 8.5 million sequences with 5.4 million representing intact, useful sequences. The sequenced library was interrogated using sequences of known SEB-binding single domain antibodies from the library obtained through phage display panning methods in a previous study. New antibodies were identified, produced, and characterized, and were shown to have affinities and melting temperatures comparable to those obtained by traditional panning methods. This demonstrates the utility of using NGS as a complementary tool to phage-displayed biopanning as a means for rapidly obtaining additional antibodies from an immune library. It also shows that phage display, using a library of high diversity, is able to select high quality antibodies even when they are low in frequency.",

            "text": "Phage display (88,89) has been widely used to produce monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for research and therapeutic purposes (90)(91)(92)(93)(94). While the first HIV-1 bNAbs were isolated from phage libraries (95), single-cell approaches have contributed most of the new bNAbs (96). Nonetheless, both scFvs and fragment antigen binding regions can be displayed on the phage surface and subjected to a selection process known as biopanning. Although NGS has been used to estimate the diversity of antibody phage libraries (97,98), its broader application has been restricted by the insufficient read length to cover both HC and LC in a scFv sequence (>800 bp). It was recently proposed that once this technical barrier is overcome, NGS can be used to directly select functional mAbs from a scFv library (99, 100), rendering a quantitative method for antibody discovery. \n\nHere, we addressed this technical challenge in a case study of the PGT121 lineage. We first characterized three types of antibody libraries constructed from PBMCs of donor-17 using gel electrophoresis (Figure 2A). Two antibody libraries were generated using different PCR methods-multiplex PCR (with gene-specific primers) and 5\u2032-RACE PCR (with single 3\u2032-reverse primers)-and showed bands around 500 and 600 bp, respectively (15). By contrast, the scFv library generated using H/L-overlapping PCR and a large primer set (Table S1 in Supplementary Material), as well as four post-panning libraries, yielded distinctive bands around 900 bp. This comparison highlights the difficulty in sequencing full-length scFv libraries. Previously, we demonstrated an extended read length of 600-700 bp in the unbiased NGS analysis of antibody repertoires using the Ion Torrent PGM and a modified protocol with 1,200 nucleotide flows (15,17,46,101). Can this NGS platform be adapted for sequencing scFvs? To test this possibility, we sequenced the donor-17 scFv libraries on the PGM using an Ion 314v2 chip and 1,500 nucleotide flows (Figure 2B).",

            "text": "George P. Smith first developed phage display technology in 1985 [8], and the technology quickly advanced in the 1990s from peptide libraries [9] to recombinant antibody fragment libraries [10][11][12][13][14][15]. A major limitation of the traditional phage-panning platform is the laborious workflow and low throughput of obtaining antibody gene sequences relying on Sanger sequencing [16]. \n\nTo improve upon the traditional workflow and obtain a more diverse panel of sequences after panning, a commonly used next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform is MiSeq from Illumina. Paired-end MiSeq (2 \u00d7 300 bp) sequencing from Illumina covers segments of about 500 bp and has been successfully applied to the investigation of shorter antibody fragment libraries, such as nanobodies derived from the camelid's variable domain of heavy-chain-only antibodies [17,18], as well as the shark variable new antigen receptor (VNAR) [19]. Paired-end MiSeq can also read amplicons long enough to cover all CDRs in single-chain Fv (scFv) [20]. However, paired-end MiSeq is not sufficient to cover longer light and heavy chain-combined sequences (1.2-1.5 kb), which are linked together in Human Fab libraries [21,22]. \n\nThird-generation NGS technology such as Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) can bridge the shortcomings of current MiSeq sequencing [23], as it is possible to achieve long sequencing reads of 10 to 15 kb in length with single-molecule real-time technology (SMRT) [24]. PacBio's NGS had been applied successfully to scFv fragment libraries [25,26]. In particular, Han et al. applied PacBio's platform to the deep sequencing of the immune rhesus macaque scFv phage library to identify additional unique antibody gene sequences previously not seen in their Sanger sequencing results [26]. \n\nIn this study, we used Bio-Rad's HuCAL PLATINUM Human Fab phage library with a diversity greater than 45 billion.",

In the current study, we utilized deep sequencing to characterize the widely used Ph.DTM-12 phage display peptide library (New England Biolabs). The next-generation sequencing (NGS) data indicated the presence of stop codons and a high abundance of wild-type clones in the na\u00efve library, which collectively result in a reduced effective size of the library. The analysis of the DNA sequence logo and global and position-specific frequency of amino acids demonstrated significant bias in the nucleotide and amino acid composition of the library inserts. Principal component analysis (PCA) uncovered the existence of four distinct clusters in the na\u00efve library and the investigation of peptide frequency distribution revealed a broad range of unequal abundances for peptides. Taken together, our data provide strong evidence for the notion that the na\u00efve library represents substantial departures from randomness at the nucleotide, amino acid, and peptide levels, though not undergoing any selective pressure for target binding. This non-uniform sequence representation arises from both the M13 phage biology and technical errors of the library construction. Our findings highlight the paramount importance of the qualitative assessment of the na\u00efve phage display libraries prior to biopanning.",

This revealed enriched genotypes with small indels and concomitant doubtful amino acid motifs within the FTO library. Nanopore sequencing of the entire display vector showed additional enrichment of large deletions overlooked by region-specific sequencing, and further impacted the interpretation of the obtained amino acid motifs. We could attribute enrichment of these corrupted clones to amplification bias due to arduous FTO display slowing down host cell growth as well as phage production.

            "text": "against target antigen, we surmise that depth of sequencing obtained in a single run is sufficient to sample our immune scFv phage display libraries, which typically have reduced diversity and clonal redundancy. This is clearly the case for libraries after multiple rounds of enrichment. However, for libraries on which limited enrichment have been performed or where a broader view of an immune repertoire is desired, the depth of sequencing may become limiting.\n\nIncreasingly, antibody discovery has become a high throughput empiric endeavor. Antibodies with desired properties, such as receptor agonism or the appropriate binding kinetics, within a population may be rare. Thus, it is often necessary to sample highly diverse populations in order to obtain the antibody of interest. Our library sequencing approach allows the isolation of large numbers of antibodies that have been affinity matured in-vivo and are thus likely to retain excellent specificity and biophysical properties. 32 Single cell screening technologies such as SLAM 33 and microfluidic-based 34 platforms similarly offer an excellent source of in-vivo matured antibodies, but themselves suffer limitations. In B cell binding strategies, screening of the antibody repertoire often requires live cells to be manipulated and sorted for antigen binding, limiting the antibody repertoire to memory B cells that express surface IgG. Microfluidic-based platforms allow the real-time interrogation of plasma cells that secrete IgG, but these technologies are technically complex and require specialized instrumentation. The strategy that we describe is relatively low cost, simple and easily adoptable by most labs while offering a depth and diversity of antigen specific antibodies similar to single cell methods. Single B cell methods have a clear advantage in the native pairing of heavy and light chains, but they are limited to a small numbers of antigen-specific B cell that can be efficiently sorted and recovered before the sequence identification. 15,35 Here we have described a simple method using SMRT sequencing to interrogate diversity from enriched phage display libraries to identify antigen-specific scFvs. The interrogation of the full-length sequences of each clone provides the advantageous information of functionally paired VH-VL selected during the phage display biopanning rounds. A logical next step for this technology will be to incorporate techniques such as single cell emulsion PCR 36 at the library generation stage. Combining these methods will enable the generation and full screening of natively paired heavy and light",

            "text": "The unique power of phage display lies in the possibility for fast and efficient identification of ligands with affinity to a desired target material out of large populations of phage clones displaying billions of different randomized peptides on their surface.However, often target-unrelated peptide (TUP) sequences rather than specific binding sequences are identified.These sequences occur for many reasons, phage can bind to components of the laboratory experimental setup, e.g. to blocking or capture reagents [8].Furthermore, the amplification of phage libraries between different rounds of library enrichment in bacteria is an essential step in the selection of ligands.However, it leads to the identification of recurrent phage clones with a propagation advantage rather than the selection of target-binding phage.Amplification also decreases the diversity of the library and it can strongly affect the identification of useful ligands.Thus, the distinction of identified ligands for either target-related or growth advantage-related selection pressure is a challenging, yet necessary obstacle in the implementation of phage display experiments.Traditional Sanger sequencing of a limited number of single clones leads to a loss of information and limits the ability to identify true positive target-binding ligands [7,[9][10][11][12].\n\nIn this study, we used next generation sequencing (NGS) to gain in-depth insight into the various fractions of three rounds of biopanning against immobilized arsenic and to evaluate the target-specific and growth-advantage related selection pressure.We were able to identify amino acids and motifs frequently occurring in fast-propagating ligands, amino acids detrimental for growth and thus leading to reduced libraries and motifs, which are potentially binding to arsenic.Using bioinformatics tools and statistics, we could confirm position-specific amino acid patterns and compared the identified motifs to known structures to prevent identification of known target-unrelated peptides.Comparing traditional Sanger sequencing to the applied NGS, we could show the increased information content gained through extensive sequencing, ultimately leading to the discovery of novel potential arsenic-binding ligands.This study may help in the planning of future phage display experiments and in the implementation of NGS and bioinformatics tools to identify specific target-binding ligands.",

            "text": "Phage display coupled with NGS has been introduced almost 10 years ago, thus changing the way of how selected phage repertoires are perceived and analyzed. Deep sequencing techniques provide a global characterization of phage display libraries and selected repertoires, increasing the resolution depth and the potential of the phage display technology for the discovery of target molecules, through the identification of consensus motifs. Today, even the most complex repertoires of selected peptides, usually obtained by in vivo selections, can be sampled to obtain a detailed view of their composition and to monitor the progress of the enrichment of specific sequences after each selection/amplification cycle. NGS facilities are easily accessible by the experimentalist and can cover all the steps from the amplification of the DNA of the phages to the delivery of the raw reads in fastq format. \n\nHowever, the development of analytical tools and strategies is far less advanced. Most software solutions have been in-house developed and not made widely available, by using standard, generic sequence comparison techniques, such as BLAST, or they had a limited scope such as PhastPep (Brinton et al., 2016) taking into account only identical sequences to compare repertoires. \n\nComputational tools for Phage Display data analysis include RELIC (Mandava et al., 2004), PEPTIDE (Pizzi et al., 1995), SiteLight (Halperin et al., 2003), and SLiMFinder (Edwards et al., 2007), which enable sequence alignment and motif detection. However, these tools were designed for smallscale analyses, whereas deeper characterization emerged as a necessity with the advent of NGS techniques. For this purpose, newer methodologies have been developed for high throughput data processing and detection of consensus sequences (Fowler et al., 2011;Alam et al., 2015;Reich et al., 2015), although these techniques did not address the issue of selectivity and comparison among different physiological conditions. This particular problem was addressed by PHASTpep (Brinton et al., 2016), a MATLAB-based tool, which enables differential analysis and selection of peptides that discriminate among different cellular states. PepSimili combines selectivity and networkbased functional analysis for prioritization of targets and derivation of biomarkers.",

            "title": "Depth of Sequencing Plays a Determining Role in the Characterization of Phage Display Peptide Libraries by NGS",
            "text": "Peptide phage display relies on the identification of genuine target binders in the recovered phages obtained from biopanning. Analysis of the exact composition of phage display peptide libraries plays a valuable role in the discovery of ligands with strong binding affinities to different biological targets [21]. To achieve this purpose, a sequencing platform capable of rigorous characterization of the composition and diversity of the peptide pool is crucial. High-throughput sequencing has been found to be suited for the analysis of the sequence composition and inherent diversity of phage display libraries [20,31]. In the current work, we made a side-by-side comparison of the capacity of two NGS platforms with different depths of sequencing in characterizing the composition and diversity of a phage display peptide library. Rodi et al. introduced two concepts to define the library diversity: Technical diversity (completeness) which corresponds to the percentage of possible members of the library existing at any absolute frequency and functional diversity which takes into consideration the absolute frequency of each distinct peptide in the library [24]. Consistent with this, Makowski and Soares proposed an analytical expression of the library diversity in which diversity is not only dependent on the number of peptides but also on the relative abundance of each peptide within the library [32]. Here, we used the number of unique sequences as a measure of library diversity. This definition is commonly used to refer to the observed diversity of phage display peptide libraries [16,19,[25][26][27][28][29][30]. Our data indicated that sequencing depth has a vital impact on the ability to characterize the diversity of the library (Table 1 and Figure 1). A comparison of the two NGS modalities with LTP (720,000 absolute cleaned reads on average) and HTP (5,470,000 absolute cleaned reads on average) showed that the HTP platform can identify a significantly higher number of unique peptide sequences (unique cleaned reads in Table 1), thus revealing a much larger diversity of the library. It is worth mentioning that detecting the full diversity of phage display peptide libraries exceeds the capacity of current NGS platforms. The theoretical diversity of a 12-mer phage display peptide library can reach 4.1 \u00d7 10 15 .",

We present a side-by-side comparison of all steps and report an integrated experimental system that greatly streamlines and expedites the entire procedure while markedly reducing its associated costs about 250-fold compared to conventional phage display selection. We show that this new methodology is not only much faster and less laborintensive, but allows rigorous quantification with improved overall accuracy. In as-yet unpublished work, deep amplicon sequencing of phage particles (i.e., tens of thousands of clones) recovered from in vivo selections in human patients in a timeframe of up to 72 hours post library administration (in contrast to less than 24 hours for the current methodology), has allowed coverage of the full repertoire of targeted particles in the analyzed tissue samples, as shown by saturation curves and the identification of a panel of previously unrecognized ligand-receptor candidates.

This method was used to clone a diverse panel of human mAbs in Fab format to tetanus toxoid after generating an antibody library from peripheral blood lymphocytes isolated from human donors who had received a booster vaccination. 73,74 A major drawback of this method is its limitation to screening as opposed to selecting antibody libraries. The number of independent clones, i.e., lysis plaques, that can be screened, even if the antigen of interest is in unlimited supply, is practically confined to 10 6 . \n\nSubsequent combinatorial strategies, e.g., phage, yeast and mammalian cell display, replaced screening with selection, allowing the mining of much larger antibody libraries approaching 10 11 independent clones. Selection is facilitated by display technologies that physically link a displayed antibody fragment to its cDNA in a defined particle such as a filamentous phage, a ribosome, or a cell. Millions to billions to, theoretically, trillions of independent particles constitute an antibody library that can be mined with antigens of interest. Particles that display antibody fragments with high affinity to the antigen are isolated. Because of the simultaneous isolation of their cDNA, the displayed antibody fragments can be copied, enabling multiple rounds of selection. In other words, the physical linkage of phenotype and genotype effectively links recognition and replication. In addition, DNA sequencing may readily identify phenotype and genotype. \n\nPhage display. The generation and selection of peptide libraries displayed on filamentous phage marked the advent of display technologies. 75",

            "text": "Abstract Peptide-expressing phage display libraries are widely used for the interrogation of antibodies. Affinity selected peptides are then analyzed to discover epitope mimetics, or are subjected to computational algorithms for epitope prediction. A critical assumption for these applications is the random representation of amino acids in the initial na\u00efve peptide library. In a previous study, we implemented next generation sequencing to evaluate a na\u00efve library and discovered severe deviations from randomness in UAG codon over-representation as well as in high G phosphoramidite abundance causing amino acid distribution biases. In this study, we demonstrate that the UAG over-representation can be attributed to the burden imposed on the phage upon the assembly of the recombinant Protein 8 subunits. This was corrected by constructing the libraries using supE44-containing bacteria which suppress the UAG driven abortive termination. We also demonstrate that the overabundance of G stems from variant synthesis-efficiency and can be corrected using compensating oligonucleotide-mixtures calibrated by mass spectroscopy. Construction of libraries implementing these correctives results in markedly improved libraries that display random distribution of amino acids, thus ensuring that enriched peptides obtained in biopanning represent a genuine selection event, a fundamental assumption for phage display applications.",

            "text": "Further work with other repertoire libraries may allow us to say more about the significance of these high copy number examples. Many sequences were excluded from analysis when the paired-ends failed to be connected by the FLASH algorithm. This is likely due to the deterioration of sequence quality with read length. The MiSeq 2X250 paired-end module reads 250 basepairs from each end and is therefore capable of producing overlaps for sequences of somewhat less than 500 basepairs. The PCR product used for this study was at the upper range for this application and will have produced overlaps of only 20-40 basepairs. This short overlap combined with lower sequence reliability is probably responsible for many of the failed pairings. The MiSeq platform now has available a 2X300 paired-end module which may be useful for future work. \n\nAfter the database was compiled, the sequences were searched using candidate antibodies obtained previously via a standard phage-display selection method. Antibodies present at a multiple copy number and deemed similar to the sequence of known SEB binding antibodies were produced and characterized in terms of affinity and stability. All seven of the characterized antibodies exhibited binding to SEB with sub-nM affinities, showing comparative affinities with those obtained through panning [20]. Average melting temperature for those identified by phage-display was 65\u00b0C, while the average for those identified by sequence similarity was 67\u00b0C, showing good agreement. Several of the sdAbs identified by library sequencing showed superior melting temperature compared to those originally identified by traditional selection. The affinity of the novel antibodies was slightly inferior to those identified by selection, but were of the same scale. \n\nThese results demonstrate that by interrogating the vast ensemble of sequences present in a library using sequences of known binders, it is possible to quickly identify numerous new antibodies with a comparable range of affinity and stability characteristics. With a high-diversity library it may often be possible to recover superior antibodies by this method. Moreover, with the decreasing cost of gene synthesis services, it is possible to identify, construct, produce, and characterize a higher number of novel antigen-binding candidates more rapidly than would be achievable using a traditional phage-display screening protocol.",

            "text": "The same cDNA that was used to construct the phage display library was prepared for Next Generation Sequencing. Approximately 5 \u03bcg of the PCR product was sequenced with a MiSeq Next-Generation Sequencing system and yielded a database of 8,573,790 full-length protein sequences. In order to assess the quality of the database, three groups of 100 random entries were selected from the library and manually examined for frameshifts, internal stop codons, and gross corruption of the expected sequence. These are presumed to be RT-PCR, PCR, or sequencing artifacts, and were found to compose 37.3 +/-2.5% of the entries. This indicates a final yield of approximately 5.4 million intact, useful sequences. This proportion is consistent with the results found by sequencing random clones to check library quality prior to screening (see Materials and Methods section). \n\nIn addition to calculating the total number of sequences, the copy number of sequences within the library can be determined. A total of 186 intact sequences from the three random groups were used as queries to execute BLAST searches against the full sequence library. The results were examined to determine the copy number for sequences within the library. For counts greater than 100 the copy number was estimated based in the proportion of the library covered by the first 100 matches. A large majority (88%) of the random sequences are present in the library as a single copy. The histogram in Fig 2 shows that sequences present at low copy numbers (2)(3)(4)(5)(6)(7)(8)(9)(10)(11)(12) comprise less than 10% of the library. Five sequences had greater than 15 copies and three had greater than 100 copies. This indicates that the cDNA library is highly diverse with only a small minority represented by more than one copy. It also suggests that the library is not a complete record of sequences present in the animal, and that a large number of native antibodies are not represented. \n\nIn order to test the hypothesis that Next-Generation Sequencing could be used to identify additional members of antibody classes, we selected exemplars from Class A (E2) and Class C (D9) to use as queries for BLAST searches against our sequence library.",

            "text": "Phage-display selection of immunoglobulin (IG) or antibody single chain Fragment variable (scFv) from combinatorial libraries is widely used for identifying new antibodies for novel targets. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has recently emerged as a new method for the high throughput characterization of IG and T cell receptor (TR) immune repertoires both in vivo and in vitro. However, challenges remain for the NGS sequencing of scFv from combinatorial libraries owing to the scFv length (>800\u2009bp) and the presence of two variable domains [variable heavy (VH) and variable light (VL) for IG] associated by a peptide linker in a single chain. Here, we show that single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing with the Pacific Biosciences RS II platform allows for the generation of full-length scFv reads obtained from an in vivo selection of scFv-phages in an animal model of atherosclerosis. We first amplified the DNA of the phagemid inserts from scFv-phages eluted from an aortic section at the third round of the in vivo selection. From this amplified DNA, 450,558 reads were obtained from 15 SMRT cells. Highly accurate circular consensus sequences from these reads were generated, filtered by quality and then analyzed by IMGT/HighV-QUEST with the functionality for scFv. Full-length scFv were identified and characterized in 348,659 reads. Full-length scFv sequencing is an absolute requirement for analyzing the associated VH and VL domains enriched during the in vivo panning rounds. In order to further validate the ability of SMRT sequencing to provide high quality, full-length scFv sequences, we tracked the reads of an scFv-phage clone P3 previously identified by biological assays and Sanger sequencing. Sixty P3 reads showed 100% identity with the full-length scFv of 767\u2009bp, 53 of them covering the whole insert of 977\u2009bp, which encompassed the primer sequences. The remaining seven reads were identical over a shortened length of 939\u2009bp that excludes the vicinity of primers at both ends. Interestingly these reads were obtained from each of the 15 SM",

            "text": "Simple Summary Monoclonal antibodies are increasingly used for a broad range of diseases. Rising demand must face with time time-consuming and laborious processes to isolate novel monoclonal antibodies. Next-generation sequencing coupled to phage display provides timely and sustainable high throughput selection strategy to rapidly access novel target. Here, we describe the current NGS-guided strategies to identify potential binders from enriched sub-libraires by applying a user-friendly informatic pipeline to identify and discard false positive clones. Rescue step and strategies to boost mAb yield are also discussed to improve the limiting selection and screening steps. Abstract Monoclonal antibodies are among the most powerful therapeutics in modern medicine. Since the approval of the first therapeutic antibody in 1986, monoclonal antibodies keep holding great expectations for application in a range of clinical indications, highlighting the need to provide timely and sustainable access to powerful screening options. However, their application in the past has been limited by time-consuming and expensive steps of discovery and production. The screening of antibody repertoires is a laborious step; however, the implementation of next-generation sequencing-guided screening of single-chain antibody fragments has now largely overcome this issue. This review provides a detailed overview of the current strategies for the identification of monoclonal antibodies from phage display-based libraries. We also discuss the challenges and the possible solutions to improve the limiting selection and screening steps, in order to keep pace with the increasing demand for monoclonal antibodies.",

            "text": "From the early 1990s, phage display technology was explored as a new method for generating mAbs (28,29). In this approach, the V gene repertoires were harvested from lymphocytes, and the combinations of VHs and VLs were cloned and expressed on the surface of filamentous bacteriophage by fusion to its coat protein (Figure 1). Then, phage particles bearing expressed specific mAbs on their tips were selected and used in conventional assays. Compared with the hybridoma technology, which was practically confined to rodents, phage display has been successfully used to screen and isolate mAbs from any species whose immunoglobulin genes are known (30,31). In 2000, Rader et al. first described the whole process of selecting rabbit mAbs with phage display technology (32). This technology was successfully used in selecting and humanizing rabbit antibodies against human A33 antigen, a target antigen for the immunotherapy of colon cancer, and the obtained humanized antibodies retained high specificity and affinity for human A33 antigen (32). At present, antibody phage display is a major technical platform to generate fully human antibodies for therapeutic purpose for its high speed and ease of antibody generation and the ability to control various selection parameters in vitro (33). \n\nDependent on our knowledge of antibody structure, function, and sequence diversity, in addition to the insights from previous antibody libraries, a new synthetic antibody library technology was developed and used in mAb production by inserting precisely designed sequences into the antigen-combining site (34,35). This technology is accomplished based on genetically copying IgG fragments and on using molecular biology techniques to diversify antibody paratopes in vitro (36). Several synthetic antibody libraries (e.g., HuCAL and Ylanthia library) with multiple variable heavy and light chain framework regions were designed and used to isolate human mAbs optimized for molecular recognition (37)(38)(39)(40). With advances in library designs and selection methods, synthetic antibody libraries will become an indispensable tool for rapid generation of target-binding mAbs with exquisite specificity.",

            "text": "Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has raised a growing interest in phage display research. Sequencing depth is a pivotal parameter for using NGS. In the current study, we made a side-by-side comparison of two NGS platforms with different sequencing depths, denoted as lower-throughput (LTP) and higher-throughput (HTP). The capacity of these platforms for characterization of the composition, quality, and diversity of the unselected Ph.D.TM-12 Phage Display Peptide Library was investigated. Our results indicated that HTP sequencing detects a considerably higher number of unique sequences compared to the LTP platform, thus covering a broader diversity of the library. We found a larger percentage of singletons, a smaller percentage of repeated sequences, and a greater percentage of distinct sequences in the LTP datasets. These parameters suggest a higher library quality, resulting in potentially misleading information when using LTP sequencing for such assessment. Our observations showed that HTP reveals a broader distribution of peptide frequencies, thus revealing increased heterogeneity of the library by the HTP approach and offering a comparatively higher capacity for distinguishing peptides from each other. Our analyses suggested that LTP and HTP datasets show discrepancies in their peptide composition and position-specific distribution of amino acids within the library. Taken together, these findings lead us to the conclusion that a higher sequencing depth can yield more in-depth insights into the composition of the library and provide a more complete picture of the quality and diversity of phage display peptide libraries.",

            "text": "The binding specificities of circulating immunoglobulins harbor a wealth of information related to the exposure history and health status of vertebrate organisms. Unbiased techniques to extract this information provide new opportunities for linking environmental exposures to disease, and discovering antigenic determinants of complex immune-related pathologies, including autoimmunity, allergic response, and malignancy. Several complementary high-throughput platforms have been developed to address the challenges of antibody profiling. (1)(2)(3)(4) We have previously described the development of Phage ImmunoPrecipitation Sequencing (PhIP-Seq), which is based on T7 bacteriophage display of synthetic oligonucleotide encoded peptidome libraries. Antibody-peptide binding is quantified via highthroughput DNA sequencing of the immunoprecipitated phage libraries (5)(6)(7)(8)(9). \n\nThe PhIP-Seq method provides several key advantages over alternative approaches. First, synthetic DNA libraries can be made to cover complete or partial proteomes, including meta-genomically defined proteins and protein variants that do not exist in nature. This database-driven design feature was utilized for the construction and screening of the phage displayed human virome ('VirScan'), which was accompanied by simultaneous high resolution alanine scanning of several dominant epitopes. (9) Further, the streamlined assay protocol takes place in solution phase (versus array-based solid phase techniques), requires no specialized equipment or instrumentation, and can be easily automated on standard liquid handling robots. (6) Perhaps the most important advantages of PhIP-Seq, however, derive from the use of high-throughput DNA sequencing technology as the assay readout. Sequencing of phage libraries is used to quantify clonal abundance with linear behavior over a large dynamic range. Critical to scalability, sample multiplexing via DNA barcoding enables screening at a per sample cost that is roughly one hundred fold less expensive than comparable array-based techniques. \n\nSequence reads, generated by deep sequencing of phage displayed peptidome libraries, are first demultiplexed and then aligned to the reference library sequences.",

            "text": "Vekris et al. (39) recently published a new computational galaxy pipeline, PepSimili, an integrated workflow tool, which performs mapping of massive peptide repertoires obtained by high throughput sequencing of phage display libraries on whole proteomes and delivers a streamlined systems-level biological interpretation. PepSimili pipeline has a user-friendly interface, but only one sample at a time could be analysed (i.e. one control sample against one test selection), thus the performance of this tool is limited when many different controls and/or selections should be analysed. Furthermore, it is not clear if both PHASTpep and PepSimili could analyse prokaryotic data. PuLSE (Phage Library Sequence Evaluation) (40) is a tool for assessing randomness and therefore diversity of phage display libraries. PuLSE is a useful pipeline that allows performing the evaluation required for QC of phage library randomness by NGS data to determine the positional and overall distribution of DNA bases and resultant amino acid propensities, calculating enrichment factors over the expected ideal. It is freely available from https://github.com/stevenshave/PuLSE as a free open source package. Another useful pipeline was developed for assessing phage display library diversity, and to investigate the bias in GE-libraries of linear, macrocyclic and chemically post-translationally modified (cPTM) tetrapeptides displayed on the M13KE platform, it was implemented as a MATLAB workflow by He et al. (41). However, the last two tools are not currently available as user-friendly web servers. \n\nThe InteractomeSeq web server overcomes all the main limitations showed by the previous bioinformatics tools for the analysis of high throughput phage display libraries: and in an asynchronous way, thus allowing the comparison among different selections performed by using the same phage library against different baits. Moreover, the intersection of enriched domains derived from more than one selection can be easily visualized through an interactive Venn diagram. 5. The computational resources required for the execution of InteractomeSeq are proportional to the size of the input files elaborated at each step (both raw data and reference sequence).",

Since then, the phage display technology has evolved to be of utility within many other areas of biomedical sciences, including the study of antibodies [11]. Phage display libraries are widely used to both discover novel antigen-specific monoclonal antibodies and also to epitope map existing antibodies [12,13]. However, while phage-display technology for studying antibody responses have been present for several decades, it has often been plagued by several common issues. For example, phage display libraries are often created using random n-mers [14] or cDNA products [15,16], which when created from the target tissue through random priming leads to ORFs of various lengths or premature stop codons [17]. Furthermore, earlier phage display technologies utilize the M13 lysogenic phage display system, which requires antigenic phages to be translocated across the periplasmic membrane, thereby introducing bias against certain amino acid peptide sequences [18]. Fortunately, advances in molecular technologies (such as microarray-based DNA synthesis and high throughput sequencing) and the use of T7 bacteriophage has enabled PhIP-Seq to overcome these challenges [9].",

In this study, phages were selected based on their interaction with patient serum and exhaustively characterised by high-throughput sequencing. A bioinformatics approach was developed in order to identify peptide motifs of interest based on clustering and contrasting to control samples. Comparison of patient and control samples confirmed a major issue in phage display, namely the selection of unspecific peptides. The potential of the bioinformatic approach was demonstrated by identifying epitopes of a prominent peanut allergen, Ara h 1, in sera from patients with severe peanut allergy. The identified epitopes were confirmed by high-density peptide micro-arrays. The present study demonstrates that high-throughput sequencing can empower phage display by (i) enabling the analysis of complex biological samples, (ii) circumventing the traditional laborious picking and functional testing of individual phage clones and (iii) reducing the number of selection rounds.",

            "text": "The usefulness of display technologies to explore fine epitope specificity of antibodies and to modify their binding properties has been validated by decades of successful application and by thousands of publications. During such a long time, however, technological platforms have significantly evolved. Basic library construction and high-throughput screening procedures are common research tools that can be used in a conventional molecular biology laboratory having the required expertise and minimal material resources. Nevertheless, industrial exploitation has been linked to further increases in the scale of molecule discovery, characterization and optimization, based on miniaturization and automation of every step. \n\nOne of the major technological breakthroughs that has contributed to shape the current landscape of library generation and screening is the emergence of NGS. While limited sequence sampling (using the Sanger method) provided a gross idea of library variability from the very beginning of display technologies, deep DNA sequencing of antibody and antigen repertoires through NGS techniques has revealed the actual diversity, completeness, redundancy and biases within these collections, helping to improve their design. Furthermore, NGS analysis of selected multi-clonal populations is powerful enough to underscore a plethora of significant selection-driven molecular patterns beyond the few molecules that typically dominate the enrichment procedure and can be identified through limited clonal screening. Deep sequencing of libraries and library products is becoming a common practice in many laboratories [65][66][67][68][69][70][71][72][73][74]116]. \n\nDespite the success of the most extended display technologies (phage, yeast and to a lesser extent bacterial display), biosynthesis of proteins such as antibodies and human antigens in any of these systems occurs in a non-natural host environment, where posttranslational modifications (for instance, glycosylation) are absent or chemically different from those introduced by mammalian cells. Additionally, folding pathways in host cells lacking the whole mammalian biosynthesis/secretion machinery can lead to improperly folded products. Such concerns have promoted efforts aimed at developing efficient mammalian display systems, where a single recombinant protein is anchored at the membrane of a cell that can be selected by FACS depending on the binding properties of the displayed molecule [117].",

            "text": "As GG assemblies were rebooted by TXTL reactions with high efficiency yielding more than 10 7 PFU (Fig. 3), we hypothesized that the GG-TXTL workflow could be used to generate libraries of engineered phages. To measure the diversity of libraries created by GG assembly and TXTL rebooting, we constructed a proof-of-concept library of T7 phages containing random DNA barcodes (Fig. 4 and Supplementary data). \n\nTo conduct an initial quality check, 20 plaques of barcoded phages rebooted by TXTL were Sanger sequenced. All examined phages were shown to contain unique barcodes (Supplementary Table S12); thus, we conducted Illumina sequencing to determine the total number of barcodes contained in the library. A small amount (<0.8%) of a TXTL reaction of barcoded T7 phages was titrated, showing 1.8 \u00d7 10 7 \u00b1 0.9 \u00d7 10 6 PFU present in the examined TXTL reaction. The remaining TXTL reaction volume (>99.2%) was propagated overnight on an E. coli host to amplify the phage pool. This step potentially introduces some bias in the phage prevalence but reduces the risk of not detecting rare barcodes. Phage DNA was extracted from the resulting lysate and sequenced to establish the diversity of the phage library. \n\nIllumina sequencing of the library identified 7.0 \u00d7 10 6 different barcodes distributed across 2.0 \u00d7 10 7 barcode-containing sequencing reads (Supplementary data). More than 75% of barcodes were observed three times or fewer (Fig. 5). However, a small subset of barcodes was identified at high frequencies, and 20 barcodes were observed more than 600 times (Supplementary data and Fig. S4). This overrepresentation of a small number of barcodes could have been caused by a combination of several factors: biases during either barcode synthesis, in phage amplification before DNA extraction, or PCR amplification during sequencing. These scenarios would result in an exponentially increased barcode prevalence, which could result in a false appearance of overabundance, which might not apply to other phage libraries.",

Specifically, the generation of 10 3 to 10 6 sequences costs ,250fold less than the conventional methodology. This strong costeffectiveness remains constant regardless of the increasing sequence number within this range (Fig. 5A). Moreover, whereas the generation of 10 3 sequences is only 0.25-fold faster, the generation of 10 4 , 10 5 , and 10 6 sequences will be 13-fold, 130-fold, and 1,300-fold faster, respectively.

It has been adopted as a critical technology in the development of therapeutic antibodies. However, a major drawback of phage display technology is that because the degree of the enrichment cannot be controlled during the bio-panning process, it frequently results in a limited number of clones. In this study, we applied next-generation sequencing (NGS) to screen clones from a library and determine whether a greater number of clones can be identified using NGS than using conventional methods. Three chicken immune single-chain variable fragment (scFv) libraries were subjected to bio-panning on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Phagemid DNA prepared from the original libraries as well as from the Escherichia coli pool after each round of bio-panning was analyzed using NGS, and the heavy chain complementarity-determining region 3 (HCDR3) sequences of the scFv clones were determined. Subsequently, through two-step linker PCR and cloning, the entire scFv gene was retrieved and analyzed for its reactivity to PSA in a phage enzyme immunoassay. After four rounds of bio-panning, the conventional colony screening method was performed for comparison. The scFv clones retrieved from NGS analysis included all clones identified by the conventional colony screening method as well as many additional clones. The enrichment of the HCDR3 sequence throughout the bio-panning process was a positive predictive factor for the selection of PSA-reactive scFv clones.",

            "text": "High throughput screening (HTS) of natural or synthetic antibody libraries is a major step in antibody discovery and engineering efforts. Most methods of HTS are based on dis-play technolo gies w hich utilize a library encoding for scFv or Fab fragments that are displayed on phage, yeast and in some cases by ribosome, bacteria or mammalian cells (1)(2)(3)(4). Current application of these technologies for the design, discovery, engineering and optimization of antibodies relies on se v eral rounds of selection, followed by Sanger sequencing of enriched clones. Sanger sequencing, howe v er, r equir es isolation of individual clones, thus limiting the number of sequences that can be analyzed. As a result, this approach permits characterizing only a handful of clones from the library, limiting the ability to identify potentially interesting clones and gain insight into the contribution of individual positions or variation to binding. Deep parallel sequencing (often r eferr ed to as next-generation sequencing or NGS) allows for the analysis of millions of sequences. Pioneering studies on a ppl ying NGS to phage display scFv libraries demonstra ted tha t it can help to deal with non-specific binding that may dominate the library ( 5 , 6 ). Other studies illustrated the power of NGS in mapping the contribution of each position to binding ( 7 ). \n\nAlthough very useful in HTS-based antibody discovery ( 8 , 9 ), second generation Illumina and Ion Torrent NGS platforms cannot handle the entire sequence of scFv or Fab in a single read ( 10 ). This shortcoming limits its utility in comprehensi v e monitoring of selection dynamics and in analyzing the contribution of an individual variant or a specific mutation to binding. Specifically, scFvs have an average length of a pproximatel y 800 bp, Fab Fvs are of the same length but usually have a much larger spatial distance on the e xpression v ector. Read length on Illumina MiSeq system does not exceed 300 bp (600 bp when using paired-end reads approach), and IonTorr ent r ead length is a pproximatel y 400 bp. Se v eral approaches may circumvent this challenge.",

            "text": "The principal drawback of high-throughput sequencing applied to antibody display libraries is related to the limited maximum read length attainable with classical NGS platforms, which is far from the average size of scFv and Fab formats (respectively 800 and 1500 bp). The most used NGS platforms in the antibody discovery field are MiSeq (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), Roche 454 (now discontinued) and Ion Torrent (Life Technologies) (Waltham, MA, USA), which offer a good balance between the maximum read length and acceptable error rate (about 300 bp and 0.1%, 600-800 bp and 1%, and 400 bp and 1%, respectively). In any case, the whole sequence information of an scFv is split into smaller fragments corresponding to the variable heavy (VH) and variable light (VL) regions [57][58][59][60]. Most of the sequencing strategies adopted so far have focused on sequencing only heavy chain complementary determining regions 3 (HCDR3) which is usually the one mostly contributing to binding, thereby disregarding information about other CDRs of heavy (HCDR1, HCDR2) and light (LCDR1, LCDR2, LCDR3) chain domains [57]. The paired-end reads, in part, compensate for the limited length of reads, allowing the Strategies to analyze phage library by second-and third-generation sequencing. On the left, the workflow for extraction of variable fragments compatible with second-generation sequencing platforms (e.g., Illumina MiSeq) is shown. Full-length scFvs and VH fragments are extracted from dsDNA of phages from E. coli. On the right, the workflow for the application of third-generation sequencing of entire scFvs by circular consensus sequencing is represented. Molecular barcoding can be included in both strategies for multiplexing samples. The indicated pros (green font) and cons (red font) are referred to as the current state-of-the-art.",

In this report, we use next-generation sequencing to analyze phage-displayed libraries and uncover a strong bias induced by amplification preferences of phage in bacteria. This bias favors fast-growing sequences that collectively constitute <0.01% of the available diversity. Specifically, a library of 109 random 7-mer peptides (Ph.D.-7) includes a few thousand sequences that grow quickly (the \u2018parasites\u2019), which are the sequences that are typically identified in phage display screens published to date. A similar collapse was observed in other libraries. Using Illumina and Ion Torrent sequencing and multiple biological replicates of amplification of Ph.D.-7 library, we identified a focused population of 770 \u2018parasites\u2019. In all, 197 sequences from this population have been identified in literature reports that used Ph.D.-7 library. Many of these enriched sequences have confirmed function (e.g. target binding capacity). The bias in the literature, thus, can be viewed as a selection with two different selection pressures: (i) target-binding selection, and (ii) amplification-induced selection. Enrichment of parasitic sequences could be minimized if amplification bias is removed. Here, we demonstrate that emulsion amplification in libraries of \u223c106 diverse clones prevents the biased selection of parasitic clones.",

            "text": "Phage display is a high throughput selection technique for large libraries of mutant proteins that links the protein library to the coat proteins of bacteriophages (most commonly M13 filamentous phage, T4, T7, and \u03bb phage). This method displays protein libraries on the surface of bacteriophages by encoding the library into a phage-derived circular DNA vector-a phagemid. The phagemid encodes a coat protein fused to a mutant protein of interest, which links the phenotype of the protein (binding ability, enzymatic activity etc.) to its genotype. Typical elements of phagemids include bacterial and phage origins of replication, a selection marker, and the gene of the displayed protein appended to a phage protein-coding gene, which may also encode a periplasmic localization signal depending on the phage protein (Figure 2A). Displayed proteins can be selected for desired function then genotyped using high-throughput selection methods followed by sequencing. This section provides a brief overview of phage display; an extensive review is published in Chapter 3, volume 580 of Methods of Enzymology [94]. (B) Simplified schematic of phage display. The protein library is transformed into E. coli and amplified using helper phages, resulting in phages displaying the protein library. The phages can then be tested for antigen binding, using surfaces or beads that contain the antigen. A washing step removes unbound phages, and positive binders can be eluted and used for reinfection and amplification of the selected phages. This bio-panning cycle is repeated for multiple rounds and remaining phages are characterized and recombinantly expressed.",

            "text": "The immune libraries are obtained from immunized animals or humans and are mostly used to discover antibodies against infectious pathogens (Trott et al., 2014) or antigenic targets in cancer patients (Thie et al., 2011;Frenzel et al., 2016). This library contains a restricted antibody repertoire that underwent antigen-driven in vivo selection (Barbas et al., 1991;Orum et al., 1993;Frenzel et al., 2016), which differs from the other phage display libraries, known as \"universal\", that theoretically provide binders for all possible antigen structures (Frenzel et al., 2016). The na\u00efve antibody libraries are generated from a pool of B lymphocytes of non-immunized donors, and one successful example is the scFv library licensed from Cambridge Antibody Technology (CAT; now part of MedImmune/AstraZeneca) (Javle et al., 2014;Almagro et al., 2019). While the na\u00efve libraries are derived from natural antibody gene repertoires, the synthetic ones are entirely based on in silico design to obtain individual antibody amino acid sequences (Fuh, 2007), bypassing the need to isolate antibody genes. The semisynthetic libraries, on the other hand, are created using both naturally and synthetically (in silico) randomized CDRs. In this library type, it is possible to redesign natural CDRs to improve the chance of finding antibodies with high specificity and affinity (Orum et al., 1993;Fuh, 2007). \n\nBuilding the phage display library is the most important step of this technology. There is a directly proportional relationship between the size of the antibody library and the probability of finding a particular antibody (Burioni et al., 1997;Almagro et al., 2019). The Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) is an important tool to analyze the variability, the sequence composition, and the size of antibody phage display libraries (Rouet et al., 2018). The construction of a phage display library is more expensive than generating hybridomas after animal immunization. However, the antibody screening step of the phage display method is faster and cheaper (Hentrich et al., 2018).",

We propose a blended approach of a long-read technology for scaffolding purposes combined with a large number of short reads from a second technology for efficient DNA sequencing of bacteriophage genomes. \n\nIn conclusion, next generation sequencing technologies offer a thrilling variety of methods to obtain bacteriophage genome sequences quickly, reliably and rather inexpensively.

            "text": "The larger size and diversity of phage display peptide libraries enhance the probability of finding clinically valuable ligands. A simple way of increasing the throughput of selection is to mix multiple peptide libraries with different characteristics of displayed peptides and use it as biopanning input. In phage display, the peptide is genetically coupled with a biological entity (the phage), and the representation of peptides in the selection system is dependent on the propagation capacity of phages. Little is known about how the characteristics of displayed peptides affect the propagation capacity of the pooled library. In this work, next-generation sequencing (NGS) was used to investigate the amplification capacity of three widely used commercial phage display peptide libraries (Ph.D.\u2122-7, Ph.D.\u2122-12, and Ph.D.\u2122-C7C from New England Biolabs). The three libraries were pooled and subjected to competitive propagation, and the proportion of each library in the pool was quantitated at two time points during propagation. The results of the inter-library competitive propagation assay led to the conclusion that the propagation capacity of phage libraries on a population level is decreased with increasing length and cyclic conformation of displayed peptides. Moreover, the enrichment factor (EF) analysis of the phage population revealed a higher propagation capacity of the Ph.D.TM-7 library. Our findings provide evidence for the contribution of the length and structural conformation of displayed peptides to the unequal propagation rates of phage display libraries and suggest that it is important to take peptide characteristics into account once pooling multiple combinatorial libraries for phage display selection through biopanning.",

In contrast to the traditional display with DNA phages, this new system has multiple advantages ranging from the rRNA construction, phages production, to biopanning for variants selection. This has broad application in virology especially through displaying epitopes (mimotopes) of challenging RNA viruses which would help in the development of both vaccines and optimize novel biomarkers for point of care kits or theragnosis. In cancer biology, random library display can lead to the selection of major immune checkpoint inhibitors for therapeutic purposes. Generalized library screens can aid in developing peptides as new drugs from library selection and evolution. The introduction of new biomolecules resulting from mixtures of selected peptides from novel libraries and appropriate nanoparticles becomes feasible. Similarly, construction of novel biosensors by evolving peptides to detect molecules and life-threatening agents can be developed as well (See Figure 2 attached) in the environment. The uniqueness of the RNA coliphage Q\u03b2 display system comes from its inherent structure, biology, and its potential broad application in live sciences. (here antibody-antigen) complex, the detection is 100% measurable (transducer saturated with detector) and the opposite (antibodies compete and hide the transducer) will be subtracted to quantify the target detected by the biosensor.",

            "text": "One of the most important products on the therapeutic recombinant protein market is the monoclonal antibody. More than 54 therapeutic antibodies have been approved for various indications, including cancer and autoimmune diseases. 1 Traditionally, therapeutic antibodies have been generated by mouse B-cell hybridoma technology followed by chimerization or humanization. 2 In the past few decades, technologies such as transgenic mice encompassing human antibody gene repertoires, and phage display of antibody libraries, have become available, facilitating the rapid flourishing of therapeutic antibodies in the drug discovery field. 3 Phage display technology frequently allows the creation of libraries containing up to 10 11 different variants, which can be used to screen antibody clones by bio-panning. 4 Despite the development of alternative display technologies such as bacterial display, yeast display and ribosome display, phage display remains the most widely used display technology due to the robustness of the filamentous bacteriophage M13. 5 Several therapeutic antibodies that are currently either approved or in clinical trials have been developed by phage display technology. 6,7 Recently, next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has allowed a massive increase in capacity to sequence genomes at relatively low cost and in a short time frame. 8 It has revolutionized multiple aspects of biological research 5 and is also actively being adopted into antibody phage display technology. Several NGS platforms are currently available, with average read lengths of 75-8500 bp and different error rates. 9 The CDR3 sequence of the V H and V L genes has been effectively determined by the MiSeq system; 10 a singledomain antibody gene was successfully determined by the MiSeq system using a 2 \u00d7 250 paired-end module; 11 and the entire V H gene was successfully sequenced using the 454 pyrosequencing system. 12 However, sequencing of the entire single-chain variable fragment (scFv) gene, which contains 750-800 bases, could not be achieved using any of these NGS platforms, to the extent of the authors' knowledge. In one study, to obtain the whole scFv gene sequence, HCDR3 sequences were first determined by the MiSeq system; the entire scFv gene was then generated by two-step linker PCR using primers based on the heavy chain complementarity",

While phage display technology enables generation and screening of up to 10 9 unique sequences, we generated small libraries that only randomized a limited number of unresolved sites within or adjacent to CDRs. For all other unresolved regions, we inferred the sequence based on mass constraints and homology to rat antibody germline genes. Striking an appropriate balance between programming unresolved regions into a library versus assigning these based on homology and mass constraints is an important, but subjective decision. Larger libraries may seem appealing, as it reduces the risk of making an incorrect assignment that affects binding, but the technical difficulty of constructing libraries escalates as the number and dispersion of randomized sites increases. It is also likely to increase the number of independent sequences that appear functionally equivalent. On the other hand, one can attempt to infer the sequence for most or all unresolved regions, such that one or a small number of antibody variants can be expressed without need for library generation. However, this approach increases the risk of making an incorrect assignment that results in a reverse-engineered product failing to accurately reproduce the activity of the parental mAb. This was the outcome experienced by Sousa et al., 6 notable as one of only 2 previous reports describing the reverse engineering of a mAb of unknown sequence, where the final product exhibited weaker binding activity than the parental antibody, despite several iterations of draft sequence correction and gene synthesis.\n\nUltimately, the complexity of a mAb protein sequencing project will be very dependent on the specific sequences under study. As found in this work and the work of others, regions encompassing CDRs are the most problematic, in particular CDR-H3 given the more extreme divergence from germline sequences due to junctional editing in combination with somatic hypermutation. We believe that the set of 4 digestions used in this work (trypsin, chymotrypsin, AspN C trypsin, GluC C trypsin) can produce a set of overlapping peptide fragments that suffices for sequencing of most V-domains, but recognize that some antibodies may present unique challenges. For example, the ability to generate small to medium sized proteolytic fragments for sequencing of CDR-H",

            "text": "The identification of new conserved epitopes resulted from analysis with two broadly neutralizing mAbs, specific for the HA2 subunit of influenza virus belonging to different clades. Both mAbs were generated by phage display from B cells of an influenza vaccinated individual [150] and from a \"nonimmune\" human antibody library [151]. Contrary to the disadvantages listed for phage display libraries, these are high affinity mAbs, in the range of nanomolar and picomolar, respectively. \n\nGeneration of mAbs by phage display technology was a breakthrough since this technology opened possibilities to isolate human antibodies for any kind of epitope/antigen without immunization. The success of this technology can be observed by the approval of some drugs, mAbs and other kinds of proteins, and many more are under clinical studies at different stages. There are some candidates for Phase 3 clinical trial, bringing promises of new drugs in the near future [25,134]. As a perspective for infectious diseases, this technology should be more widely applied for rapid screening of antibodies for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes based on immune or na\u00efve human libraries when epidemic infectious disease breaks without an available drug for its treatment. Other perspective concerns the combinatorial library construction. Recently, the human antibody repertoire derived from blood of human na\u00efve or immunized donors has been intensively analyzed by next-generation sequencing [152,153]. Advances in the knowledge of the human antibody repertoire would help in the designing of antibody libraries and for antibody maturation of existing human libraries, making possible the selection of mAbs with higher affinity for clinical use.",

(22) and for the critical profiling of the repertoire of antibody specificities of polyclonal sera, i.e. profiling the IgOme (23,24), see also (25).\n\nAn implicit assumption in phage displayed based applications is that the library to be screened truly represents an unbiased comprehensive collection of peptides from which affinity selection can proceed.The selected peptides can be taken, therefore, to faithfully represent the structural idiosyncrasies and/or specific binding activities of the antibody (or antibodies) being analyzed.",

This repertoire design was highly effective in generating nM-affinity clones with specificity for a selection of proteins and peptides (Knappik et al., 2000;Marget et al., 2000). \n\nThe methods used by Knappik et al. (2000) have since been elaborated upon in a number of reports. Rothe et al. (2008), reported the construction of the next-generation library HuCal Gold\u2122 in which the design strategy was refined to change the CDR design complexity, the structural format of the library (to Fab fragment) and also to move to \"CysDisplay\" in which the expressed antibody is tethered to the phage via a disulphide bond with a mutant p3 protein. In this library, the CDR diversity was extended to the CDRs 1 and 2 of both V-domains, in addition to the CDR3s. The CDR cassettes were again based on trinucleotide technology and were built to accurately reflect the canonical structures and diversity found in the families upon which each of the consensus frameworks were built, consciously including structures known to be preferred in the recognition of peptides. The finalized library was found to be of very high practical utility, routinely generating antibody specificities and affinities in the single digit nM range that were useful for both therapeutic and reagent purposes (Jarutat et al., 2006(Jarutat et al., , 2007;;Ohara et al., 2006;Prassler et al., 2009). This library design had, however, made a critical concession to optimize its function in E. coli expression and phage display technology: the FRs were codon optimized specifically to maximize for E. coli periplasmic expression rate. In addition, this function had been aggressively selected for by pre-screening all antibody sequences for periplasmic transport as \u03b2-lactamase fusions before inclusion in the final library.",

In short, we isolated ssDNA from M13 phage using NaI/EtOH precipitation and purified it using phenol-chloroform extraction. The variable regions were isolated from the library and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (25 ng of ssDNA) using barcoded primers (See Supplementary Scheme S1). We used 35 cycles of amplification because this protocol was suggested by Illumina (IL) and used by phage display researchers in at least three independent groups (18,40,41). The dsDNA PCR fragment corresponding to the expected size was purified by gel extraction. A total of 75 ng of the PCR fragment from each library was pooled together and processed for IL sequencing using the manufacturer's protocols for end repair, adenylation, adapter ligation and PCR amplification of the product. The samples were sequenced on HiSeq IL using a 50-bp single-end run. FASTQ files were analyzed using custom MATLAB scripts (Supplementary Scheme S3). The software generated plain text-based lists of sequences and their abundances (Supplementary Scheme S2). These text files were used by MATLAB scripts to generate Figures 3-7 (see 'Data Visualization' section below). Raw FASTQ files (>10 Gb of data) are not included in this manuscript, but are available on request.",

            "text": "These technologies are becoming more commonplace, but the phage display platform remains the leading technology (Sidhu, 2000). \n\nPhage display libraries are heterogeneous mixtures of fusion phages, each one carrying a different foreign DNA insert and displaying a different protein on filamentous phage surface (Cwirla et al., 1990;Devlin et al., 1990;Scott and Smith, 1990;Smith and Petrenko, 1997). Such libraries containing billions of phage clones (some libraries are as high as 10 12 diverse) are extensively used to screen and select for peptides that bind with high-affinity to target molecules. The selection procedure known as \"panning\" or \"biopanning\" (depending whether selection is performed in vitro or in vivo, respectively) is simple and involves four major steps (Figure 1) (Parmley and Smith, 1988). After 3-5 rounds of selection against the desired target, individual clones are isolated and the primary structure of the binding peptides is deduced by nucleotide sequencing. Peptide sequences obtained in this manner may then be used in alignment search for known proteins (Koivunen et al., 1999).",

Our approach is based on the use of an innovative phage display system that using the \u00df-lactamase gene as an ORF and folding reporter allows to improve the functionality and the representativity of the proteins library fragments displayed on the surface of the phage. \n\nThe platform has been validated in different contexts showing to be functional and useful for the identification of novel antigens in different pathological conditions and for the study of bacterial genomic DNA for advanced annotation (D'Angelo et al., 2011(D'Angelo et al., , 2013;;Gourlay et al., 2015;Antony et al., 2019). Furthermore, in the context of bacterial-host interaction, further to be representative of the whole bacterial genomic DNA, our method allows also a representation of the complete ORFeome of a bacterium at the protein level, thus being a useful tool for the identification of novel biomarkers of the infection and/or of specific clinical outcomes. DNA typing has demonstrated that H. pylori strains are extremely different due to a high rate of mutation or recombination of their genome. This variability reflects strain virulence and may be paralleled by differences  51), from patients with Gastric Cancer (29 sera), Autoimmune Gastritis (10 sera), and MALT lymphoma (6 sera).

In order to obtain an antigenic repertoire of the bacterium as wider as possible, we used two H. pylori strains that were clinically isolated and whose genome sequences are completely available and fully annotated. Sequencing analysis of the phage libraries obtained showed that they were representative of the entire ORFeome of the bacterium, covering about 90% of the genome, thus the two phage libraries obtained were considered representative of the whole antigenic repertoire of H. pylori.",

            "text": "In the future, the integrated approach presented here may eventually be chosen for use with alternative high-throughput sequencing approaches other than the one developed by 454-Roche. \n\nThe large sequence dataset presented here has covered over 90% of the phage diversity of all human tissues we investigated and has provided a high-confidence list of tissue-specific ligands. Sets of high-confidence tissue-specific peptides along with improved statistical analysis of longer motifs can be undertaken after the sequencing of phage DNA recovered from a large number of tissues, as well as from specific tissue samples recovered by micro-dissection from paraffin-embedded tissues. In fact, largescale sequencing of na\u0131 \u00a8ve (unselected and unamplified) libraries may--for the first time--provide an accurate measurement of their size (i.e., number of unique sequences), a result allowing the empiric (rather than theoretical) demonstration of the true randomness of insert sequences. In this study, it should be noted that we used targeting peptides for validation, but there is no reason that antibodies would not be as effective. Indeed, one might speculate that the DNA-based approaches introduced in this study will eliminate the need for ''helper'' phage for phage antibodydisplay selection, and finally enable its in vivo application. \n\nOne technical aspect merits an additional brief commentary. Next-generation sequencing approaches are being improved constantly, and the newest chemistry platforms [such as SOLiD TM (Applied Biosystems) or Illumina Genome Analyzer (Illumina, Inc.)] may actually permit the generation of .100 million sequencing ''reads'' per run without the inherent challenge of homopolymer sequencing of this pyrosequencing platform. For both sequencing technologies, a major limitation is the short length of possible DNA analytes (,100 nucleotides), which may prove suitable for combinatorial phage libraries (displaying small peptides). Nevertheless, because the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of such methods has not been vetted, it remains to be determined whether other massive sequencing platforms may eventually replace the platform used here. \n\nTechnological advances have already brought about a new era for genomics, epigenomics, and transcriptome studies.",

            "text": "To determine phage diversity and candidate peptide motif enrichment, we calculated saturation curves from large-scale sequences produced from either each tissue and/or unselected library and showed that the coverage of phage particles present in these targeted tissues varied from 93.3 to 94.4% of the available predicted distinct total peptides in each tissue. The high coverage achieved for all tissues after the sequencing of 40,000 to 63,000 phage amplicons in this round of synchronous selection [29] strongly suggests that most of the diversity in these tissues has been covered (Figs. 4A-D). In striking contrast to the targeted tissues, the sequencing of the non-selected library showed its predicted diversity, which was far from saturation post evaluation of 5610 4  DNA sequences (Fig. 4E). Finally, we investigated whether this large dataset would allow the discrimination of more and/or longer motifs in the distinct tissues than previously reported [20]. Indeed, we observed that many more 3-mer, as well as 4-mer and 5-mer motifs, were revealed by next-generation sequencing (from 10-to 100-fold increment) in comparison to those observed in the more limited, Sanger-sequencing-derived dataset (Figure S2). These results show that DNA deep-sequencing through nextgeneration approaches (i) is technically feasible and (ii) offers an unprecedented high-coverage of the displayed ligand repertoire. All phage sequences produced here are available online (Phage Sequences File S1).",

            "text": "Whilst a multitude of software (commercial and open source) is available to assess the read accuracy of NGS runs, quantifying the accuracy of sequences recovered, no program was available for the task of ensuring that randomized stretches of phage display libraries were truly random. We identified an approach taken by Rodi et al. in which sequencing and inspection of 100 clones in a non-automated manner was used to assess diversity present in phage display libraries [26]. However, Makowski and Soares argue that a more accurate measure of diversity can be achieved by automated analysis of large pools of sequencing data accessible with NGS techniques [27]. Although NGS aware tools such as fastqc (http:// www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc) do report per base sequence content and PHASTpep counts occurrences of unique sequences between biopanning rounds [28], currently to our knowledge, no tool exists to put these sequences in the context of codon and amino acid frequencies as suggested by Makowski, with or without a dynamic reading frame necessary for the quality control of phage display libraries. \n\nHere we present our new software tool; PuLSE (Phage Library Sequence Evaluation), capable of filling this need by exploiting information present in a sample from a phage display library to build up DNA base propensities at each randomized position. PuLSE is freely available from https://github.com/stevenshave/PuLSE as a free open source package under the MIT license. Using PuLSE, library sequencing output in the fastq file format can be analyzed to determine the positional and overall distribution of DNA bases and resultant amino acid propensities, calculating enrichment factors over the expected ideal. The reading frame is dynamically identified by use of up and downstream markers for forward and reverse sequence reads, performing a dynamic alignment for each sequence read to identify randomized library positions. Uniquely, PuLSE is reading frame aware, able to dynamically locate the start of randomized library stretches, a feature essentially required for the analysis of phage display libraries and not present in other sequence analysis software. In addition, PuLSE may be easily adapted to phage display systems which employ nonsense suppression [29], and allows assignment of any DNA base triplet to custom amino acid residue encoding.",

            "text": "We analyzed the enrichment of a phage display library against CD160 derived from rats immunized with DNA encoding fulllength protein. The library was subjected to three rounds of panning against recombinant antigen. We looked at clonal evolution within the library after each round. Data sets were aligned against the Rattus norvegicus germline database. 17 A total of 9434, 9336, 22660, and 14368 functional reads were obtained from the sequencing of pan 0, 1, 2 and 3, respectively. We investigated the IGHV/ IGHJ and IGKV-KJ usage in clones to give an indication of changes in library diversity through rounds of panning. The frequencies of variable and joining regions were visualized using circular correlation analysis (Figure 1a). In pan 0, 519 clones used IGHV1-43 paired with IGHJ2 correlating to 5.5% of the unpanned library. After three rounds of selection, this pairing represented 0.37% of the library, while there was a concomitant increase in the presence of clones using the IGHV5S13 and IGHJ2 gene segments from 2.6% to 60.1%. This demonstrates that the library approached clonality after the third selection round. A similar pattern was observed with kappa chain frequency, where there was an increase from 1.1% to 33% of clones using the pairing IGKV4S9 IGKJ2. A more modest enrichment of IGKV-J pairs is indicative of the ability of antibody heavy chains to pair promiscuously with multiple light chains while retaining function.\n\nTo further understand the depth and diversity of sequence, we performed a Bayesian analysis of the VH regions within the library at each round of panning. 18,19 Mutations across IGHV regions of a group of sequences were compared to the closest parent germline sequence and assigned a selection score \u03a3. For example, \u03a3 FWR of \u22121, 0 and 1 indicate strongly negative, neutral, and strongly positive selection, respectively, to the framework regions (FWR) of the sequences (Figure 1b). In pan 0, the highest frequency germline used was IGHV1-43*01, which occurred 94",

Phages are well suited to form an important part of this solution, particularly with regard to biofilm-associated infections, and approaches to help identify the most promising phages for pharmaceutical or biotechnological exploitation will be vital to the realization of more effective phage-based products.\n\nCurrently, the selection of phages to be used for the development of therapeutic applications is understandably driven by phenotypic characterization and activity against target pathogens, with genetic characterization often a secondary activity primarily used to screen for undesirable genes such as toxins. However, the generation of phage genome sequences is now accessible and affordable, and the increasing range of tools available for analyzing these data mean this aspect of phage characterization should now be viewed as a primary process in the selection of candidate phage for the development of therapeutic products, or other biotechnological applications. Although next generation sequencing technologies generating short reads (such as Illumina platform sequencing) can pose challenges in the correct assembly of some phage genomes, such approaches can still provide useful information regarding phage gene content and broader evolutionary relationships. However, technologies such as single molecule nanopore sequencing can potentially generate genome length reads, and we demonstrate here some of their potential to address many of the current limitations of next generation sequencing for phage genome analysis, related to read length. Furthermore, platforms such as the Oxford Nanopore MinION require no specialist genomics facilities or support to operate, offering the possibility for genome characterization of newly isolated phages to become a much more routine aspect of phage characterization.",

Our NGS analysis allowed us to comprehensively assess the vast array of VHH sequences present in the library, providing valuable insights into its potential for the discovery of antibodies. Furthermore, we utilized phage display technology to isolate VHHs that specifically target three therapeutically relevant antigens from the constructed library. Through the selection of VHHs with high binding affinity and specificity using phage display, we successfully identified potential hits for future therapeutic applications.

            "text": "Phage display technology is a common approach for discovery of therapeutic antibodies. Drug candidates are typically isolated in two steps: First, a pool of antibodies is enriched through consecutive rounds of selection on a target antigen, and then individual clones are characterized in a screening procedure. When whole cells are used as targets, as in phenotypic discovery, the output phage pool typically contains thousands of antibodies, binding, in theory, hundreds of different cell surface receptors. Clonal expansion throughout the phage display enrichment process is affected by multiple factors resulting in extremely complex output phage pools where a few antibodies are highly abundant and the majority is very rare. This is a huge challenge in the screening where only a fraction of the antibodies can be tested using a conventional binding analysis, identifying mainly the most abundant clones typically binding only one or a few targets. As the expected number of antibodies and specificities in the pool is much higher, complementing methods, to reach deeper into the pool, are required, called deep mining methods. In this study, four deep mining methods were evaluated: 1) isolation of rare sub-pools of specific antibodies through selection on recombinant proteins predicted to be expressed on the target cells, 2) isolation of a sub-pool enriched for antibodies of unknown specificities through depletion of the primary phage pool on recombinant proteins corresponding to receptors known to generate many binders, 3) isolation of a sub-pool enriched for antibodies through selection on cells blocked with antibodies dominating the primary phage pool, and 4) next-generation sequencing-based analysis of isolated antibody pools followed by antibody gene synthesis and production of rare but enriched clones. We demonstrate that antibodies binding new targets and epitopes, not discovered through screening alone, can be discovered using described deep mining methods. Overall, we demonstrate the complexity of phage pools generated through selection on cells and",

Hence, two versions of Protein 8 can be expressed and assembled in the phage without the need or use of helper phages.We have used these chimeric systems expressing libraries of random peptides ranging in length from 6-12 residues and have found all to be compatible with Deep Panning.As a case in point, we describe the use of a 7 mer library.This has led to some rather surprising results for which we decided to first carefully examine the profile and distribution of random peptides in our na\u0131 \u00a8ve libraries before conducting antibody analyses.1) were used as the dataset for Mapitope prediction of the GV4H3 epitope.The single predicted cluster comprises two discontinuous segments of the antigen (green and blue) brought to flank the core of the epitope (residues 221-226, pink).(B-E) MEME analysis of the GV4H3 derived peptides.The 20 top most frequent peptides of Capture #3 (see Table 1) generated a major motif ''AGWAV''.This motif (B) and three additional motifs are identified when all 4,823 peptides are analyzed.The ''VGF'' motif (C) is a simpler version of the major motif.",

            "text": "Since the seminal works by George Smith [1] and McCafferty et al. [6] over three decades ago, the field of antibody engineering has seen remarkable progress in the discovery and development of therapeutic antibodies. This progress has been built and is in part the product of several generations of phage display antibody libraries. In the previous sections, we reviewed nine of the libraries generated over the last decade. The goal was to assess the state of the art in phage display antibody discovery and outline commonalities and differences among the diverse libraries. The libraries reached 10 10 -10 11 antibody variants, the maximum possible size. The effective size, understood as the percentage of display, was 50-90%, with most of the libraries reaching 85%. Such libraries yielded nM or sub-nM binders. Interestingly, the average hit rate of the libraries was similar (\u224810%), regardless of the nature of the antibody repertoire-be it na\u00efve, synthetic, or semisynthetic-used as the substrate to build the libraries. The main difference seemed to be in the diversity and developability profiles of the antibodies. While na\u00efve libraries have the advantage of capturing the natural repertoire of antibodies, some antibodies selected from these libraries may bear developability liabilities. To circumvent this limitation, synthetic and semisynthetic libraries have undergone several iterations to improve their design, particularly at the HCDR3. These new libraries, together with the recent expiration of patents in the field, should allow academic laboratories and small biotech organizations the free use of phage display methodology. The widespread use of antibody phage display should foster innovation, further the exploration of diverse and novel targets, and generate novel incremental improvements in the phage display methodology. \n\nFunding: This work was partially supported by the project \"Laboratorio Nacional para Servicios Especializados de Investigaci\u00f3n, Desarrollo e Innovaci\u00f3n (I + D + i) para Farmoqu\u00edmicos y Biotecnol\u00f3gicos, LANSEIDI-FarBiotec-CONACyT\".",

            "text": "The random distribution of amino acids ensures that the identified peptides have become enriched in the recovered pool due to a genuine selection, and not in a biased target-independent manner. Divergence from this randomness can lead to overrepresentation, underrepresentation, and censorship of some peptide sequences in the na\u00efve library. Overrepresentation can result in the propagation-related enrichment of nonspecific peptides during panning, whereas underrepresentation and censorship can deplete the library of some promising hits. Another type of compositional bias that might exist in the constructed library is the high number of clones without inserts, i.e., wild-type clones. These clones do not display any peptides and are regarded as an artifact of library construction. \n\nIt is of paramount importance to assess the quality of the constructed library prior to biopanning. This is done through DNA sequencing of the library clones. Traditionally, Sanger sequencing has been used to analyze the library quality [7]. The major shortcoming of this approach is that only a tiny fraction of the library (up to a few hundred clones) is subjected to sequence analysis. The emergence of high-throughput sequencing, also known as next-generation sequencing (NGS), technologies have substantially contributed to the area of phage display research. NGS improves the analysis of phage display libraries by sequencing thousands to millions of clones simultaneously which provides a more detailed understanding of the library quality [8]. In the current study, we used NGS to characterize the commercial Ph.D. TM -12 library offered by NEB. This library displays linear 12-mer peptides and has been used extensively for finding target-specific hits [9][10][11]. Our NGS-based analysis indicated that the na\u00efve library contains compositional bias, reflected by the non-random representation of sequences at DNA, amino acid, and peptide levels as well as a high frequency of wild-type clones. Based on these results, we discuss how these deviations from randomness are significant for library screening and can negatively impact the selection of genuine binders during cyclic rounds of bio-panning.",

            "text": "Sidhu and co-workers used 454-sequencing to boost selection of peptides binding to different PDZ domains [8][9][10]. Notably, the authors used barcoded primers for the preparation of library for sequencing and, thus, sequenced 22 independent panning experiments in one run. [8] Lerner and co-workers applied 454 sequencing to find antibodies that bind to various proteins displayed on the surface of bacteria [11]. Sequencing technologies of throughput higher than 10 4 -10 5 could provide more complete coverage of the libraries. Increased throughput could also allow analysis of multiple experiments in a single run. Illumina/Solexa deep-sequencing technology analyzes a library of blunt-ended double stranded DNA (dsDNA) fragments and generates up to 10 9 base pair (bp) reads in a single run. For example, Fisher and co-workers recently demonstrated the use of Illumina sequencing to characterize phage-displayed libraries of single chain antibodies (scFv) [12]. Fields and co-worker used Illumina sequencing to characterize selection from libraries of WW-protein displayed on T7 phage [13]. Johan den Dunnen and co-worker used Illumina to characterize peptide libraries after one round of panning against cell surface receptors [14]. In this paper, we present a one-step PCR that converts a library of M13KE plasmids isolated from the phage library to a collection of short dsDNA sequences suitable for Illumina sequencing. Using custom MatLab software, we perform large-scale analysis of sequence diversities. \n\nUsing deep sequencing, we explore the effects of amplification of phage libraries in bacteria on the diversity of peptides in these libraries. In previous publications, the result from sequencing of ~100 phage clones suggested that the amplification process enriches for specific peptide sequences [15,16]. Large scale sequencing, however, can provide observations that could not be interpreted from the sequence of 100 clones [17]. For example, deep sequencing of a library of DNA aptamers demonstrated that repeated amplification does not select for particular sequences. Instead, it enriches DNA sequence motifs that have low stability [18,19].",

Analysis of the exact composition of phage display peptide libraries plays a valuable role in the discovery of ligands with strong binding affinities to different biological targets [21]. To achieve this purpose, a sequencing platform capable of rigorous characterization of the composition and diversity of the peptide pool is crucial. High-throughput sequencing has been found to be suited for the analysis of the sequence composition and inherent diversity of phage display libraries [20,31]. In the current work, we made a side-by-side comparison of the capacity of two NGS platforms with different depths of sequencing in characterizing the composition and diversity of a phage display peptide library.

            "text": "More than 20 computational methods for analyzing phage display next generation sequencing data, for reporting target-unrelated peptides (TUPs) and for predicting epitopes have been reviewed by He et al. (32). Some of the most relevant bioinformatics tools that have been used to analyze data deriving from Phage Display libraries sequencing include RELIC (33), PEPTIDE (34), DNAStar (35), SiteLight (36) and SLimFinder (37). These tools allow motif detection and epitope alignment but have been designed for the analysis of a limited number of sequences and they do not allow the comparison of different samples. On the other hand, PHASTpep (38), PepSimili (39), PuLSE (40) and NGS-Trex ( 19) have been used to analyze large datasets deriving from the high throughput sequencing of Phage Display libraries and allow the comparison between different samples and selections. PHASTpep is a MATLAB software that has been used for the discovery of cell-selective peptides. The software code is freely available but a graphical user interface is not available neither the pipeline was included in a web server. NGS-Trex has been widely used for the analysis of phage display library datasets (12,14,15,17). It was originally designed for RNA-Seq analysis and the result file shows a list of genes statistically enriched and sorted according to a parameter called 'Focus', but NGS-Trex is not able to predict the presence of multiple domains/epitopes present in each gene/protein and represented within the phage library analysed. At the same time, its output table lacks of the amino acid or nucleotide sequence of the domain, thus it is not possible to perform downstream analysis at the protein level. Vekris et al. (39) recently published a new computational galaxy pipeline, PepSimili, an integrated workflow tool, which performs mapping of massive peptide repertoires obtained by high throughput sequencing of phage display libraries on whole proteomes and delivers a streamlined systems-level biological interpretation.",

We used a fraction of our previously constructed PDL of Nbs derived from an E. coli lipopolysaccharide-immunized Indian desert camel in order to obtain the dataset of NGS reads of Nbs. The cryo-preserved transformants library was revived to extract the Nb-encoding VHH (inserts)-pHEN4 (vector) DNA pool. The DNA sample was used for amplifying VHH pool by PCR [6] . The VHH amplicons band was gel-purified and subjected to NGS using Illumina MiSeq TM platform. 'Nextra XT micro V2 Index' kit was used for the Nb library DNA sample sequencing, with the adaptors: 'i7' (N706: TAGGCATG) and 'i5' (S517: GCGTAAGA). The raw data comprised of a total read count of 182146 (matched = 179591; unmatched = 2555), with average read length of 130.33 bases and a total of 23.74 Mb. Of 179591 matched reads, 142004 were paired reads and 37587 broken paired reads. The raw data of NGS reads was submitted to NCBI Sequence Reads Archive accessible at URL: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/study/",

A phage display library of open reading frame (ORF) fragments was created from mRNA derived from different tissues. This was used to study the interaction network of the enzyme transglutaminase 2 (TG2), a multifunctional enzyme involved in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis, associated with many different pathologies. After two rounds of panning with TG2 we assayed the frequency of ORFs within the selected phage population using 454 sequencing. Ranking and analysis of more than 120 000 sequences allowed us to identify several potential interactors, which were subsequently confirmed in functional assays. Within the identified clones, three had been previously described as interacting proteins (fibronectin, SMOC1 and GSTO2), while all the others were new. When compared with standard systems, such as microtiter enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay, the method described here is dramatically faster and yields far more information about the interaction under study, allowing better characterization of complex systems. For example, in the case of fibronectin, it was possible to identify the specific domains involved in the interaction.",

            "text": "Discovering protein-protein interactions is an important goal in life sciences (Morelli and Hupp, 2012). The number of interacting proteins for any given eukaryotic protein can be relatively large. Classic examples include the ATM/ATR kinases which are reported to have over 700 substrates (Matsuoka et al., 2007). It is becoming apparent that one of the main drivers of such a diversity of protein-protein interactions are linear motifs that form weak, but specific protein-protein interactions important in cell signaling. Linear motifs form vast numbers of combinatorial protein-protein interaction interfaces that offer a rich source of signaling diversity (Tompa et al., 2014). Thus, advances in approaches for discovering functional linear peptide motifs is important for the protein science field. \n\nPeptide combinatorial libraries could provide a powerful platform for high throughout linear peptide motif discovery. The power of massively diverse combinatorial peptide phage display lies in its ability for an efficient and rapid identification of peptide ligands from a phage population displaying millions of diverse surface peptides. In addition, the reliance on in vitro screening is also an advantage in that the bait conformation, buffers, and selection conditions can be applied selectively. In vitro selection previously conditions identified MDM2 protein interactors; pre-incubating MDM2 with its ligands including zinc or RNA can give rise to the isolation of distinct linear peptide motifs from phage-peptide populations (Shimizu et al., 2002;Burch et al., 2004). However, a major disadvantage of the phage-peptide pool has been the relatively low throughout in peptide identification by DNA sequencing. Typically, only dozens of peptides are identified from sequencing using standard Sanger sequencing platforms (Murray et al., 2007). Next-generation sequencing methods could create a platform in which the diversity of the peptide-phage library can be fully exploited through the sequencing of thousands or millions of peptide inserts. In this report, we set up a nextgeneration sequencing platform on a peptide-phage library screen that can sequence using Roche454J platforms up to 70,000 inserts from one reaction (Figure 1).",

            "text": "This set of experiments showed that \"genotypeto-phenotype linkage\" could be achieved and thereby defi ned the basis of all display technologies developed since. \n\nThe subsequent development of a method for the effective cloning of antibody V-gene sequences via PCR allowed the capture of antibody sequences in a recombinant form [ 6 ], removing the need to immortalize B-cells via hybridoma fusion as required in traditional monoclonal antibody generation. This discovery was combined with the phage display process to make an effi cient method of isolating antibodies and their corresponding gene sequences simultaneously [ 7 ]. In the antibody phage display process, libraries of diverse V-gene sequences are cloned into an appropriate expression vector in E. coli , creating an in-frame fusion with the p3 protein or, as favored in most recently described libraries, a truncated form of p3. \n\nThe phage display of protein libraries was originally performed using \"phage\" vectors (i.e., built upon the phage genome itself), but due to practical diffi culties in handling these libraries, more recent phage methods have mostly used so-called phagemid expression vectors. In this case, the DNA backbone is a stable, small plasmid such as pUC, and the p3 gene plus f1 phage packaging origin are the only phage-derived DNA sequences [ 8 ]. These phagemid libraries are more easily handled and more stable than phage libraries, as the plasmid is incapable of causing phage production by itself. The libraries can therefore be more simply cloned, expanded, and controlled than phage libraries. \n\nBy infecting \"helper\" phage (based on M13) into a growing culture of E. coli harboring a phagemid library, the phage propagation machinery is provided, but due to a mutation introduced in the origin of replication on the helper phage genome, preferential packaging of the phagemid DNA and p3 fusion occurs during phage replication [ 8 ]. Phage production is thereby induced, genotype-to-phenotype linkage is created, and the expressed phage particles are interrogated for the presence of useful protein sequences via target binding.",

            "text": "The abundance of species might range by a few orders of magnitude [26]. It is possible that error analysis tools developed in the above areas could find use in phage display sequencing. For example, there are multiple published algorithms for removing errors from low copy number reads to ascertain that low copy number sequences are new species and not sequencing errors (e.g., see [27][28][29] and references within). Metagenomic analysis is usually more complex than analysis of phage-display libraries. First, in metagenomics, the bacterial or viral genes must be assembled from short reads de novo. Second, there is no simple relationship between phylogenetic classification of \"species\" and the observed DNA sequence. Third, the exact number of species in the environment is unknown. On the other hand, sequencing of phage-displayed peptide libraries has none of these problems: (i) it requires no assembly steps because each sequence is covered by one read; (ii) a unique DNA sequence defines a unique \"species\"; and (iii) the theoretical complexity in synthetic libraries is known exactly. For small libraries, such as the library of 7-mer peptides, the complexity, (20) 7 , is within the reach of next-generation sequencing. We see phage-displayed peptide libraries as an ideal model playground for the development of optimal error analysis and error correction protocols. It is possible that error analysis developed from phage libraries analysis could then be used in other areas such as genomic and metagenomic analyses. \n\nThe errors in sequencing could be divided into \"annotated\" and \"invisible. \" The \"annotated\" errors that originate from misincorporation of nucleotides are annotated using Phred quality score [30]. These annotated errors are removed during the processing (see below). Examples of \"invisible\" errors are sequence-specific frame shifts that lead to emergence of truncated reads during the Illumina sequencing [31]. Invisible errors could also originate during the preparation of the libraries for sequencing. Examples are removal of AT-rich fragments during purification of dsDNA [32] and erroneous incorporation of nucleotides during PCR [33,34]. Mutations have the most significant impact on the observed diversity of the library.",

            "text": "One of the most widely utilized synthetic platforms is phage display, which relies on genetic encoding and expression of the variable regions of an immune receptor (as a fusion to viral capsid protein), thus providing a phenotype-genotype linkage (Smith, 1985). The displayed variable domains when derived from a BCR/ antibody can either be in an scFv format in which the VL and VH domains are connected via a peptide linker or in a fragment antigen-binding (Fab) format, which consists of the variable and the first constant domain of each light and heavy chain. In the context of a TCR, direct display is challenging due to low stability and expression of a soluble TCR, thus the most common format uses disulfide-bond-linked TCRs (dsTCRs) in which additional disulfide bonds increase the stability (Boulter et al., 2003) or the scTCR format in which the alpha and beta chain are connected via a peptide linker. One of the main advantages of phage display over other synthetic platforms is the ability to create very large recombinant libraries of up to 10 11 variants. These libraries are constructed either from natural immune repertoires (e.g., infected patients or immunized animals) or synthetic repertoires via different mutagenesis and DNA synthesis approaches. Phage libraries are screened via biopanning, which involves the addition of the library to immobilized antigen, washing out unbound phage variants, and finally eluting bound phages. The bound phages are then amplified and subjected to multiple rounds of panning to enrich for antigen-specific phage. The introduction of immune repertoire sequencing in the phage display screening process gives valuable insights, guides the selection process, and improves library design (Barreto et al., 2019;Dias-Neto et al., 2009;Glanville et al., 2015;Ravn et al., 2010). Deep sequencing of panning rounds has uncovered that many high-affinity binding clones become depleted due to fitness costs and that enriched clones identified can exhibit higher antigen selectivity (Ravn et al., 2010;Saggy et al., 2012;Wang et al., 2010).",

            "text": "We used a llama pre-immune phage display library [14] for isolating nanobodies that are able to bind to CRP. The efficiency of the phage display library panning was evaluated after two rounds of selection by assessing the binding specificity of 90 arbitrary selected clones. The phage ELISA experiment compared the signal intensity in the presence of either the coating molecule alone (BSA, negative control) or BSA plus the target antigen CRP. The clones were considered positive when the ratio between the specific (CRP) and the control (BSA) signals, performed in triplicate experiments with the phages present in the culture supernatant, was above five. Applying such filter conditions, 36/90 clones resulted positive and were submitted for sequencing, which provided 20 correct and complete sequences, corresponding to 14 unique sequences; A6 was repeated twice and A12 six times. Three clones (A12, B9, C10) had specific-to-background ELISA scores close or higher than 15, four others (A6, A10, C1, E12) had scores of 12-13 and all had a very basic isoelectric point (Table 1). \n\nThe yields of purified proteins and their corresponding affinities are reported together with the data relative to MW and pI. Clones A12 and H7 were also identified by yeast display. \n\nBoth framework and CDR2 residues were highly conserved, whereas the CDR3 regions were, as expected for nanobodies, very heterogeneous with had no evident consensus sequence and length varying between 7 and 14 amino acids (Figure 1). The CDR1 and flanking amino acids were highly variable as well. Affinity was calculated using BLI. higher than 15, four others (A6, A10, C1, E12) had scores of 12-13 and all had a very basic isoelectric point (Table 1).

According to a report by Derda's group, the deep sequencing of ampli\ue103ed phages without binding selection identi\ue103ed 770 parasitic clones in the Ph.D.-7 library, 197 of which were sequences identi\ue103ed in the literature. 12 Hence, the ampli\ue103cation bias imposes inefficient selection.\n\nNext-generation sequencing (NGS) or deep sequencing have been reported to reduce the effects of such bias, where enriched sequences have been identi\ue103ed by comparing phage pools without binding selection (control experiment). 13,14 However, when the diversity of the phage library is enormous (theoretically 20 8 peptides when eight residues are randomised), the number of NGS reads (10 5-6 ) is orders of magnitude less than the diversity in the library and cannot cover even 1% of the total. Thus, when comparing two different sequence subsets, most of the sequences are detected in either one or the other, restricting the usage of enrichment analysis.\n\nIn this report, we demonstrate 'pattern enrichment analysis', which comprehensively calculates enrichment by focusing on all three-residue positions (Fig. 1a). This concept is based on fundamental insights into natural protein-protein interactions, involving 'hotspots' consisting of a few key residues. 15,16 For example, three hydrophobic residues Phe9, Pro10 and Pro13 of MBM1 (menin binding motif 1) at its interaction site are critical for binding to menin. 17 Because the discovery of hotspots is of primary importance in phage display, we envisage that pattern enrichment analysis focusing on a few residues is productive. Moreover, restricting the analysis to three positions can reduce the theoretical sequence patterns to 8000 (\u00bc20 3 ), which is a smaller number than for NGS reads. When NGS reads 10 5 sequences, each single pattern is counted 12.5 times on average, facilitating quantitative evaluation between two subsets. Comparison with a control (without binding selection) would reduce the compositional bias and lead to the practical identi-\ue103cation of hotspots.\n\nWe also hypothesise that the combination of the abovementioned approach with a structured peptide library would be effective because the sequence patterns obtained by the analysis have spatial implications.

            "text": "Beyond the scFv format, different layouts of antibody fragments have also been used to construct phage display libraries, including the antigen-binding fragment (Fab) or the single domain antibody (sdAb) [29][30][31][32]. Antibody libraries are surveyed by several affinity selection and screening cycles, each one consisting of (1) incubation of the phage repertoire with the target of interest (biopanning); (2) intensive washes; (3) elution; (4) amplification step in E. coli; and 5) extensive ELISA assays to identify specific binders. The molecular baits used in biopanning are usually recombinant proteins or target-expressing cells. Subtractive selection cycles are commonly included in the screening to remove clones recognizing non-target related molecules, i.e., the Fc fragment for Fc-tagged recombinant proteins, or cells not expressing the target of interest (Figure 1) [33]. Phage selection was also developed in vivo by performing selection cycles in living animals; this strategy is properly applied when the target of interest is modified upon in vitro modeling [34,35]. \n\nAdalimumab was the first human monoclonal antibody, isolated by phage display with a \"guided selection\", to be approved for clinical applications in 2002 [36]. This notwithstanding, the phage antibody library selection and screening process is slow, expensive, and often limited by the number of clones that can be tested by binding assays, thus representing a bottleneck to expand the use of mAbs. Emerging technologies are resizing this hurdle, paving the way to an expanded use of this approach. \n\nTo this end, a very significant milestone in antibody discovery by phage display was the application of next-generation sequencing (NGS) to the screening procedure. The application of NGS in place of standard screening methods, requiring intensive use of ELISA (or other binding assays), has dramatically increased the throughput and decreased the working time of the phage antibody library discovery platform.",

            "text": "Immunoselection of random sequences from a phage display library has long been used to characterize the binding specificity of proteins and monoclonal antibodies [13,14], before next generation sequencing has been available. The traditional approach recommended by the manufacturer of the library is to use the antibody to pan for phage that bind and then elute the phage and amplify them by infection of E. coli. This process is repeated two more times to enrich for the phage that specifically bind to the antibody and then individual phage plaques are selected and sequenced to reveal the common pattern of amino acids in the cognate phage. While this process should select for phage that specifically bind to the antibody, it may introduce bias in the observed sequences by selecting for phage sequences that amplify more rapidly than others. Traditionally, individual plaques were purified, sequenced and the sequences aligned to identify amino acid residues that are important for binding. Next generation sequencing eliminates the need for purifying individual plaques because all of the phage that bind can be sequenced simultaneously. Sequences that bind non-specifically to the protein A magnetic beads and all antibodies can be easily identified in appropriate controls and subtracted from the sequences specific to the antibodies of interest, potentially eliminating the need for subsequent pannings. We sequenced all three sequential pannings after amplification and also sequenced the 3rd panning after elution of the phage and before amplification to test the effect of phage replication on observed sequence abundance and diversity. \n\nFor 4G8 antibody, we obtained 8,068 unique sequences for the first amplified panning round, 826 for the second amplified round, 5,923 for the third unamplified panning, and 13,555 for the third amplified round. It is not clear why there were significantly fewer unique sequences in the second amplified round, but it may be due to an inefficient sequencing run due to a poor PCR amplification product rather than a failure of the phage to replicate because the number of unique sequences increased greatly in the next panning and these sequences must have been present in the second round. We ranked the sequences according to the number of times a particular sequence was encountered in a sequencing run and the top 32 sequences are shown in Fig 1 .",

As the genomes of hundreds of phages have been sequenced, identification of their virion proteins will be helpful for the development of new phage display systems. P.-M.

            "text": "More the three decades ago, the seminal works by George Smith 35,36 and Greg Winter 6 gave birth to the phage display technology as a platform for peptide and antibody discovery. In the subsequent thirty plus years practicing phage display, it has been well established that the size and functionality of a library are critical parameters for success in isolating specific and high affinity antibodies from said library. Early selections from antibody phage-displayed libraries of 10 7 members generated ~90 nM antibody fragments to diverse proteins. 12 Further studies using larger libraries, e.g., >10 10 members, 8,13 produced antibody fragments with single-digit nM or sub-nM affinities. Similarly, a synthetic library called the Griffiths' library 9 of >10 10 members produced sub-nM binders, whereas antibody fragments of >100 nM were obtained when a small portion of the library containing only 10 7 clones was used in the selection process. \n\nIn parallel, as therapeutic antibody engineering and development evolved in the past decades, and dozens of antibodies were granted marketing approvals, it has been realized that reaching the desired specificity and affinity is not enough. 4,16 Other biological and biophysical properties such as expression, stability and solubility should be considered during the early discovery phase, so that the risks of failure in the late therapeutic development phase are minimized. This is particularly true for antibodies isolated using phage display, where the discovery process is performed in vitro, without the filters imposed in vivo. In such cases, the selected antibodies must be extensively scrutinized to ensure they meet the proper threshold of stability, solubility and low aggregation at the concentrations needed for therapeutic development. 17 e approached the design and construction of ALTHEA Gold Libraries\u2122 keeping these concepts in mind, i.e., generation of large and functional libraries with enhanced stability and low aggregation. We followed a three-step construction process that led to a progressive increase in functionality and stability, culminating in a valuable source of antibodies, as showed by panning the libraries using different strategies and an array of seven non-related targets. In all the cases specific antibodies were obtained. The best anti-HSA antibody and the two anti-TNF ones had a biophysical profile that meet the success criteria of antibody candidates amenable to further development.",

            "text": "Phage display has shown enormous promise in ligand identification and heralded new advances in the discovery of peptides with diagnostic and therapeutic applications. However, it is likely that challenges will be met on the ligand discovery road using phage display. Differentiating genuine target binders and false positives is a crucial step in enhancing the integrity of phage display selections. Our findings exemplify the importance of reporting not only successful phage display selections but also biopanning experiments where the isolated peptides fail to bind to the target of interest. Also, our study highlights the importance of trying to explore the reasons behind the observed failure, as it can help advance the understanding of the selection process and optimize the phage display protocols. Choosing suitable phage display libraries, using appropriate selection conditions (balanced stringency), validating downstream assays, and applying proper controls in both the selection process and downstream characterization are all determining factors that impact the quality of the peptides identified in phage display selections. More importantly, the sequencing strategy used for analyzing the results of selection and choosing candidate peptides for downstream binding characterization plays a major role in troubleshooting the selection process and improving the identification of promising hits. In this context, NGS can overcome some of the bottlenecks associated with the commonly used Sanger sequencing approach and avoid misidentification of the nonspecifically enriched TUPs. We believe that counterculture reports, like the current study, can make a significant contribution to our deeper understanding of the anatomy of the fall and rise of a phage display library selection. Beyond doubt, the constructive debates ignited by such reports that are born from less-than-optimal results can be eye-openers for phage display scientists. Based on this, we hope that our work will shine light on some of the less-discoursed aspects of phage display in peptide discovery.",

Using 30\u00c2 coverage was sufficient to assemble the majority of phage genomes both in silico and from experimental data. However, due to the uneven coverage produced by either the NexteraXT preparation or biological properties of the phage genome, a coverage of 100\u00c2 would be recommended as a starting point to maximise the likelihood of successful assembly in a high-throughput manner. In silico analysis predicts that pooling two, three, or even four phages from different hosts into a single NexteraXT library preparation can increase the throughput of phage genome sequencing, without increasing misassemblies or additional costs for increased barcodes and library preparations. The current bottleneck in phage genomics is now clearly the ability to culture phages and isolate their DNA, rather than the capacity to sequence or assemble them.",

The results from this initial computational study would guide their future efforts to uncover the protein protective mechanisms of plant seeds during heat stress. \n\nAs we mentioned previously, the blueprint of phage display proposed by Professor George Smith has inspired many scientists to adapt and improve this technique. Different phages and various coat proteins have been tested to construct new phage display systems. As the genomes of hundreds of phages have been sequenced, identification of their virion proteins will be helpful for the development of new phage display systems. P.-M. Feng et al. presented a Na\u00efve Bayes-based method that can predict phage virion proteins using amino acid composition and dipeptide composition in \"Na\u00efve bayes classifier with feature selection to identify phage virion proteins. \" In their jackknife test, the classifier achieved an accuracy of 79.15% to divide phage virion and nonvirion proteins, which were superior to other state-of-the-art methods. \n\nUsing next-generation sequencing techniques to enable cost-effective high-throughput analysis is a new trend in phage display technology. However, the trend suffers from errors in deep sequencing data, which may exceed 1%. W. Matochko et al. proposed a linear algebra framework for analyzing errors in a 7-mer peptide library with a medium scale sequenced by Illumina method in \"Error analysis of deep sequencing of phage libraries: peptides censored in sequencing. \" As technical capabilities and depth of sequencing increases, the method would be applicable to larger libraries as well. \n\nIn summary, the six papers in this volume involve in various aspects of informatics tools and their applications in several fields using phage display technique.",

In this report, we analyzed diversity of amplified libraries using Illumina and observed a collapse of diversity in phage-displayed libraries after a single round of growth in bacteria. The collapse of the 10 6 -scale library to a few hundred abundant sequences would not be visible in small-scale Sanger sequencing [17,20,21]; it could also have been difficult to detect with smaller-throughput 454 Sequencing. \n\nCharacterization of sequence diversity is important for phage display technology, which has been used in over 5000 publications and patents in the past 20 years. It has enabled the discovery of ligands for hundreds of targets, yet the literature still contains several poorly-explained observations: (1) identical sequences could emerge from unrelated screens for unrelated target [22,23], and (2) screens that should yield a large number of diverse ligand often yield only one sequence motif (reviewed in [16]). The nearly complete sequence coverage of libraries illuminates the origin of these observations. It highlights that the collapse of diversity in amplification might be one of the major limitations of phage-display technology. Deep-sequencing analysis will make it possible to bypass problems originating from the unwanted collapse of diversity [11]. \n\nLarge-scale analysis could also help developing methods that preserve diversity of peptide libraries [24,25]. It can be used to enable discoveries of ligands that previously have been lost in phage display screens.",

We recently reported a novel pIX phagemid display system that is characterized by a strong preference for phagemid packaging combined with low display levels, two key features that support highly efficient affinity selection. However, high diversity in selected repertoires are intimately coupled to high display levels during initial selection rounds. To incorporate this additional feature into the pIX display system, we have developed a novel helper phage termed DeltaPhage that allows for high-valence display on pIX. This was obtained by inserting two amber mutations close to the pIX start codon, but after the pVII translational stop, conditionally inactivating the helper phage encoded pIX. Until now, the general notion has been that display on pIX is dependent on wild-type complementation, making high-valence display unachievable. However, we found that DeltaPhage does facilitate high-valence pIX display when used with a non-suppressor host. Here, we report a side-by-side comparison with pIII display, and we find that this novel helper phage complements existing pIX phagemid display systems to allow both low and high-valence display, making pIX display a complete and efficient alternative to existing pIII phagemid display systems.",

It is based on the fusion of each antibody sequence to the sequence of the pIII surface protein of the filamentous bacteriophage M13, a natural virus of the bacterium Escherichia coli with the shape of a 1-\u03bcm-long and 10-nm-wide cylinder (17). The engineered phage encapsulates the DNA sequence of an antibody and displays the corresponding polypeptide at its surface. Populations of up to 10 14 phages displaying a total diversity of up to 10 10 different antibodies can, thus, be manipulated. A round of selection consists of retrieving the phages bound to either the bottom of a plate, where the PVP target is attached, or magnetic beads, where the DNA target is coated. It is followed by a round of amplification achieved by infecting bacteria with the selected phages. We performed experiments where each sequence is initially present in at least 10 4 copies and where targets are provided in at least a 100-fold excess. Starting either from a single library (single framework) or a mixture of different libraries, three rounds of selection/amplification were performed. Although the enrichment of some of the sequences is intended to reflect binding to the specified targets, other factors may contribute, such as sequence-specific differences in amplification. In our experiments, such nontarget-specific selective factors can be detected but are nondominant (SI Appendix). Our analysis and its interpretation, however, do not rely on the precise nature of the selective pressure.\n\nHigh-Throughput Sequencing. We sequenced samples of 10 6 \u2212 10 7 sequences at different rounds of selection by Illumina Miseq paired-end high-throughput sequencing (18). The results give us an estimation of the relative frequencies f t i of each sequence i in the population at each round t = 0, 1, 2, or 3. In estimating these frequencies, we take into account both sequencing and sampling errors (Materials and Methods).\n\nProvided that a sequence i is present in many copies n t\u22121 i and n t i before and after selection, its probability to be selected can be estimated",

            "text": "In vitro evolution and selection of genetic libraries is central to molecular biology research. In drug discovery, the selection of lead compounds from random genetically encoded libraries complements rational drug design. Many Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved antibodies and peptides on the market have originated from selection and evolution experiments (1,2). Selection from genetically encoded libraries is finding increasing utility in areas such as the development of new chemicals, the design of new materials and the discovery of new chemical reactions (3)(4)(5). Screening experiments-such as phage display (6,7), nucleotide display, cell display, Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX) and DNA aptamer selection (8,9)-use libraries with a diversity of >10 9 unique sequences, which are then narrowed to 10 2 -10 6 useful library members. In a screen that aims to identify binding sequences for a specific target, selection increases the abundances of sequences that have high binding capacity. Sequencing of clones enriched during in vitro selection is often used to analyze the selection preferences and the enrichment for sequence motif(s). Collapse of the na\u0131\u00a8ve library to a collection of a few sequences indicates that selection narrowed onto clones that bind to a target ( Figure 1A). While most screens exhibit convergence to one sequence motif, screens against the surfaces of cells or tissues (10)(11)(12), mixtures of antibodies (13)(14)(15)(16) or other proteins, could converge on multiple binding epitopes. The screens against such 'multisite targets' could yield information about multiple ligands for multiple receptors on the cell (10,11). In recent years, deep sequencing approaches have been used to assist the analysis of phage-displayed selection (17), and in many cases, the selection against multisite targets (18)(19)(20). Our group used deep sequencing to detect convergence, which occurs in the phage display screens without any selection ( Figure 1B). We amplified 10 6 sequences from a na\u0131\u00a8ve library in bacteria, and observed that amplification alone enriched a few hundred motifs by 10-100-fold and depressed the remaining 10 6 motifs (21).

The nanobody phage library was generated as described by Hanke et al. 6 . Phage display was performed on biotinylated RBD immobilized on streptavidin magnetic beads (Dynabeads M-280, Invitrogen) or strep-tagged spike immobilized on Strep-Tactin XT magnetic beads (IBA Lifesciences). To select for non-RBD binders, the phage enrichment on the spike protein was performed in the presence of nonimmobilized RBD. Next generation sequencing and enrichment analysis. Nanobody phage libraries were sequenced at baseline and after each panning, as described in Hanke et al. 6 . Briefly, phage libraries are amplified by PCR, and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq instrument (2 x 300). The establishment of a nanobody phage library described above overwrites the N-terminal region of the VHH with a cloning primer, which includes ambiguous nucleotides. Here we used this to investigate the internal consistency of each panning step. Sequencing primers were trimmed, and reads were collapsed by identity, retaining the frequency of each sequence. We performed an interim frequency analysis that compares the frequency of the two most frequent \"versions\" of each variant, where \"versions\" have identical sequences after the cloning primer, but distinct ambiguities in the cloning primer sequence (considering the three N-terminal ambiguities to prevent bias driven by priming effects). If a panning run is consistent in which variants are enriched, then there should be agreement between two versions of each variant. Figure S1 shows that this is true of RBD and ScRBD panning, but much less so of S panning. For downstream analysis, the cloning primer region was excluded when calculating variant frequencies. To reduce sequence error and the volume of data for downstream analysis, we exclude all non-functional sequences (with early",

            "text": "The definition of diversity as the number of unique sequences is a commonly accepted idea in phage display literature [16,19,[25][26][27][28][29][30], motivated by increasing number of NGSbased phage display works in recent years which allow for sampling of a larger sequence space. In the current study, we investigated the capacity of two sequencing depths (each on two different input volumes) of NGS to characterize the unselected Ph.D. TM -12 phage display peptide library. In a broad sense, low-throughput (LTP) sequencing refers to Sanger sequencing and high-throughput (HTP) sequencing refers to all the different types of NGS platforms. In this work, we denote LTP as the NGS platform with the lower throughput (MiSeq Reagent Kit v2) and HTP as the NGS platform with the higher throughput (NextSeq 500/550 Mid Output Kit v.2.5). The aim of the current study was to provide an evaluation of the impact of sequencing depth on the analysis of diversity, quality, and composition of an unselected phage display peptide library. Our findings indicated that a higher sequencing depth offers a more rigorous evaluation of the library diversity and quality, uncovers a more heterogeneous distribution of peptide frequencies, provides a comparatively higher capacity for the differentiation of peptide frequencies, and results in the detection of distinct amino acid and peptide compositions for the library compared to sequencing modality with the lower depth. Based on the results, we discuss how the sequencing depth can lead to different outcomes for the characteristics of the library, alter the direction of analyses, and make a major impact on the final conclusions drawn from phage display data.",

In such experiments, protein expression, purification and phage selections are performed in 96-well plates and the retained phage pools are analyzed by nextgeneration sequencing [55].

            "text": "Initially, the standard technique was to pick and amplify individual clones from the final enriched phage pool and test them side-by-side in an ELISA to distinguish the specific binders. The identity of the displayed peptides with specific binding could be individually determined by Sanger sequencing. \n\nSoftware programs have been developed to assist in the analysis of peptides identified through phage display. One of the earliest programs, REceptor LIgand Contacts (RELIC) [10] is still popular in the phage display community. Although RELIC was limited by biases associated with the original phage display technique, it made the great contribution of enabling users to align sequences and find motifs from phage display experimental results. Since RELIC, databases such as PEPBANK [11] and MimoDB [12], have been generated to browse for similar peptide sequences among those compiled from previously-conducted biopanning experiments. Other algorithms and programs were used to analyse results via methods that aligned sequences, performed epitope-mapping, and identified motifs, including MIMOP [13], PEP-TIDE [14], SiteLight [15], Multiple Em for Motif Elicitation (MEME) [16], DNAStar [17], Short Linear Motif Finder (SLiMFinder) [18], and Multiple Alignment using Fast Fourier Transform (MAFFT) [19]. Importantly, all of these methods were designed to interpret the small-scale results of traditional phage display. Thus they were still susceptible to many of the aforementioned weaknesses of the technique and a much deeper characterization of the postbiopanning enriched phage library would later prove to further enhance analytic capabilities. \n\nThe necessary deeper characterization became attainable with the advent of next generation sequencing (NGS) techniques, whereby it became possible to increase the yield of sequences from hundreds to millions and overcome some of the drawbacks of phage display. NGS has similarly been employed in other in vitro selection fields, including yeast display [20], mRNA display [21], antibody display [22][23], protein domains [24], and aptamer selection [25][26][27].",

            "text": "The generation and selection of peptide libraries displayed on filamentous phage marked the advent of display technologies. 75 The use of phage display for the generation and selection of antibody libraries, displayed in either scFv [76][77][78] or Fab 79,80 format, revolutionized the field of mAbs and antibody engineering in the early 1990s, arguably accelerated by an intense competition between researchers at the Medical Research Council (Cambridge, UK) and The Scripps Research Institute (La Jolla, California, USA). Over the past 20 years, phage display has proven to be the most robust and versatile mining tool for human antibody repertoires, yielding human mAbs to virtually any antigen of interest. 8 The process of multiple rounds of selection on a purified antigen or on antigen-expressing cells, referred to as panning, can be adapted to positively or negatively select a range of desired antibody properties, such as affinity, specificity, manufacturability and catalytic activity. While scFv (~25 kDa) and Fab (~50 kDa) still dominate the phage display format, human antibody repertoires have also been mined through the display and selection of single variable domains (~12.5 kDa) of heavy and light chain. 81,82 ypically, recombinant fusion to the N-terminus of phage protein pIII or a fragment of pIII provides the physical linkage of antibody fragment and phage, facilitating monovalent display in phagemid systems and multivalent display in phage systems. 83 ther multivalent display systems use phage proteins pVIII and pIX as fusion partners. 79,84 For the generation of human mAbs with high affinity, monovalent Fab display through phage protein pIII is generally preferred. 85 Phage display relies on the expression offering a diverse and attractive repertoire of antigen specificities readily available in the blood. As memory B cells contain only relatively small quantities of specific RNA, the successful cloning of both heavy and light chain variable domains from a single B cell poses a significant technical challenge. In spite of this, antibodies have successfully been cloned from single peripheral B cells, including mAbs against self-antigens, 61,62 tetanus toxoid 57 and HIV-1 gp140. 63",

            "text": "The ability to identify coding sequences within a genomic interval using a proteomic approach is important to complement current genome-protein strategies that rely solely upon DNA sequence information. Coupling epitope display libraries from human genomic regions with antibody selection for expressed epitopes has the potential to enrich for library members with coding (exon) sequences. A phage display library containing the full human genome sequence could be an invaluable tool for human protein-protein interaction identification. Some variables to consider in construction of such a complete library include the DNA sequence space to be covered (3r10 9 bp human genome), the insert size (e.g., 100-300 bp exon size), number of partial overlapping inserts desired (diversity), and functional peptide display due to stop codon effects on display. For example, the absolute minimum number of members in a library of the human genome composed of 150 bp inserts would be about 2r10 7 members (3r10 9 bp/150 bp); however, 90% of these would not display peptides due to stop codons in genomic sequence. Thus, it's desirable to generate a library of at least two magnitudes greater size (>10 9 members). A library with large diversity favors potential binders; however, large libraries are difficult to construct. A practical limitation is the efficiency of transforming bacteria with plasmid,  To determine the utility of using a human genomic library approach to select coding regions, an epitope phage display library was constructed using exon-sized fragments from a human genomic region containing the 5q31 Interleukin gene cluster. The size-selected library contained sufficient diversity to cover the sequence space for a 50 kb BAC with 100 bp inserts. Selection of the epitope library using anti-Interleukin antibodies enriched for phage members containing 'true' Interleukin epitopes, as well as for other sequences. An IL-4 epitope sequence was selected from the library against the C19 antibody, which recognizes the C-terminal epitope of the last exon of IL-4 [18]. An associated 46 bp unrelated small fragment of human telomeric sequence (2PTEL066, 176-130) was fused to the IL-4 gene and",

            "text": "BackgroundFilamentous phage display has become an ordinary tool to engineer antibody fragments. Several capsid proteins have been applied for displaying antibodies, of which gene III (p3) protein is used the most followed by experiments with gene IX (p9) protein. Despite the popularity, there are no library scale studies to objectively compare differences in the selection performance of the libraries, when displayed via different capsid proteins.ResultsIn this study, an identical antibody repertoire was displayed as Fab fragments on p9, p3 and truncated p3 (p3\u0394). In addition, the library clones were displayed as ScFv fragments on p3\u0394 and the Fab-p3 display valency was modulated by hyperphage and VCS-M13 superinfections. The selection performances of the libraries were followed in repeated parallel panning reactions against streptavidin (STR) and digoxigenin (DIG). Selection was successful with all display formats, but the enrichment of specific clones from Fab-p9 library was clearly less efficient than from the other libraries. The most diverse outputs were obtained from p3\u0394 display and the highest affinity anti-DIG antibodies from the ScFv repertoire. Unfortunately, the number of retrieved specific clones was too low for explicit analysis of the differences in the number of obtained unique clones from each library. However, severe reduction in sequence diversity was observed in p3-Fab libraries prior to panning, which in turn, materialized as a low number of unique specific clones. Oligovalent display by hyperphage resulted in a higher number of unique clones, but the same highest affinity anti-DIG Fab was recovered also by VCS-M13 superinfection.ConclusionsThe compromised enrichment of the target-specific clones from the Fab repertoire as a fusion to p9 capsid protein in our experiments, the significant loss of functional diversity in Fab-p3 library after single phage packing cycle and the retrieval of higher affinity anti-digoxigenin clones as ScFv molecules than as Fab molecules from the same source repertoire indicate that the chosen display format may have a significant impact on the selection outcome. This study demonstrates that in addition to library content, also display related issues, should be taken into consideration when planning directed evolution experiments.",

            "text": "A high-throughput sequencing provides a tool for rapid analysis of the selection and direct identification of the most enriched antibodies, with greater affinity, without requiring a step of their expression. In addition to the speed of analysis, it is possible to investigate the original diversity of the library; identify all antibodies that enriched, the most enriched, and the rare in the population; and determine the frequency of increase throughout the selection. This is possible because sequencing technologies, called next-generation sequencing (NGS), are used, and they allow sequencing a large number of sequences, in the order of millions, in the same sequencing reaction [54]. The interpretation of NGS results from antibody libraries requires the use of a bioinformatics tool specialized in calculating the enrichment of variable domains in a selection of Phage Display. Different tools for this purpose are described in the literature, such as the recent ATTILA pipeline [55]. \n\nDespite providing a profound assessment of all antibodies in all cycles, two major problems arise in the analysis of biopanning by sequencing. The first corresponds to the noise in the identified final sequences that results from the sequencing process or the gene amplification reaction. However, more accurate pipelines for isolating DNA libraries for sequencing and more powerful bioinformatics analysis programs have been produced to overcome the artifacts introduced by PCR and sequencing errors. The second is the limitation of the high-performance sequencing methodology that, although it allows the sequencing of millions of sequences, can only properly read up to 400 base pairs. Therefore, this analysis requires that the variable domains of the heavy and light chain of antibodies, whose size ranges from 300 to 400 base pairs, be amplified and sequenced separately, resulting in the loss of the VH and VL pairs of the most enriched antibodies. Recently, studies have been carried out to provide a method of sequencing without losing the VH and VL pairs of antibodies. In the analysis of the selection process by a high-throughput sequencing, the antibody's genotype is first determined and then their phenotype is characterized [53,56,57].",

            "text": "Phage display technology is a common approach for discovery of therapeutic antibodies. Drug candidates are typically isolated in two steps: First, a pool of antibodies is enriched through consecutive rounds of selection on a target antigen, and then individual clones are characterized in a screening procedure. When whole cells are used as targets, as in phenotypic discovery, the output phage pool typically contains thousands of antibodies, binding, in theory, hundreds of different cell surface receptors. Clonal expansion throughout the phage display enrichment process is affected by multiple factors resulting in extremely complex output phage pools where a few antibodies are highly abundant and the majority is very rare. This is a huge challenge in the screening where only a fraction of the antibodies can be tested using a conventional binding analysis, identifying mainly the most abundant clones typically binding only one or a few targets. As the expected number of antibodies and specificities in the pool is much higher, complementing methods, to reach deeper into the pool, are required, called deep mining methods. In this study, four deep mining methods were evaluated: 1) isolation of rare sub-pools of specific antibodies through selection on recombinant proteins predicted to be expressed on the target cells, 2) isolation of a sub-pool enriched for antibodies of unknown specificities through depletion of the primary phage pool on recombinant proteins corresponding to receptors known to generate many binders, 3) isolation of a sub-pool enriched for antibodies through selection on cells blocked with antibodies dominating the primary phage pool, and 4) next-generation sequencing-based analysis of isolated antibody pools followed by antibody gene synthesis and production of rare but enriched clones. We demonstrate that antibodies binding new targets and epitopes, not discovered through screening alone, can be discovered using described deep mining methods. Overall, we demonstrate the complexity of phage pools generated through selection on cells and show that a combination of conventional screening and deep mining methods are needed to fully utilize such pools. Deep mining will be important in future phenotypic antibody drug discovery efforts to increase the diversity of identified antibodies and targets.",

Being able to sequence millions of DNA molecules at a time in practically only a few days has a major impact on the way selections and their evaluation can be performed. For instance, the diversity of initial libraries can be analyzed, as demonstrated by Pons and co-workers [73]. They have obtained more than one million sequences for their na\u00efve scFv phage display library using Roche/454-pyrosequencing, which has allowed the analysis of immunoglobulin V-gene usage in their library. Furthermore, NGS made it possible to follow the enrichment process of displayed molecules during all rounds of selection. Dias-Neto et al. recently used the Roche/454-pyrosequencing platform to analyze the outcome of in vivo peptide library selections in cancer patients [74]. They additionally evaluated the outcome of the selection by sequencing large numbers of clones by the Sanger method and a comparison of these results with NGS revealed that ~80-95% of all sequences generated by traditional sequencing have also been recovered by NGS. In another recent report, Ravn et al. monitored the enrichment process over multiple rounds of selection with an antibody library in scFv format using the Illumina/Solexa Genome analyzer platform [75]. They could demonstrate that all positive clones identified by classical ELISA conducted at the end of a selection were also recovered by NGS. Yet some highly enriched clones were missed by conventional ELISA-screening but successfully identified by NGS. These clones were subsequently analyzed and found to be badly expressed in E. coli as soluble antibody fragments and hence escaped the ELISA screening. \n\nApplying a phage display library of fragmented human cDNA, Di Niro et al. conducted a proteinprotein interaction screen for the identification of interaction partners of human transglutaminase 2 (TG2) [30].",

Although successful, traditional phage library screening is laborious and can map only some of the epitopes. To accelerate and improve epitope identification, we have employed massive sequencing of phage-displayed antigen-specific libraries using the Illumina MiSeq platform. This enabled us to precisely identify the regions of a model antigen, the meningococcal NadA virulence factor, targeted by serum antibodies in vaccinated individuals and to rank hundreds of antigenic fragments according to their immunoreactivity. We found that next generation sequencing can significantly empower the analysis of antigen-specific libraries by allowing simultaneous processing of dozens of library/serum combinations in less than two days, including the time required for antibody-mediated library selection. Moreover, compared with traditional plaque picking, the new technology (named Phage-based Representation OF Immuno-Ligand Epitope Repertoire or PROFILER) provides superior resolution in epitope identification. PROFILER seems ideally suited to streamline and guide rational antigen design, adjuvant selection, and quality control of newly produced vaccines. Furthermore, this method is also susceptible to find important applications in other fields covered by traditional quantitative serology.",

            "text": "Literature summarizing the effects of amplification is rare.The motivation of this review, therefore, is to organize the findings from the phage display literature and to show explicit evidence that the amplification of libraries leads to a loss of useful binding ligands.The elimination of the processes that lead to the undesired loss of diversity during amplification enables the identification of a much broader repertoire of binding ligands, including the identification of multiple ligands for targets with multiple binding sites (e.g., cells, tissues).We describe two approaches that have been used to bypass this unwanted loss of diversity: (1) selection without amplification; (2) amplification in isolated compartments.We also discuss approaches to characterize the loss of diversity in current phage display screens: (1) deep-sequencing of phage libraries; (2) bio-informatic analyses of library diversities; (3) databases of phage-display screens.\n\nThis review focuses on libraries based on functional filamentous phage, which is used to display short peptides.The loss of diversity during amplification also occurs in related techniques based on phagemid-display [26,27] which is used to display natural [28,29] or synthetic [3,30,31] antibody fragments and other full-length proteins [32,33], as well as displays with other types of phage (T4, \u03bb).Competition during amplification is not unique to phage; it also occurs in other display systems.We will outline them briefly in the last section of this review.",

            "text": "In recent decades, various display technologies have been used for the identification of proteins and peptides as well as for in vitro evolution. Thanks to the robustness of filamentous bacteriophage M13, phage display remains the predominant display method compared to others, such as bacterial, yeast or ribosome display [9]. Due to the drop in sequencing costs, phage display can now be combined with next-generation sequencing (NGS), resulting in the capacity for presenting up to 10 6 -10 8 random peptides that can be evaluated for interaction [10]. \n\nSince its development in 1985 [11], phage display technology has been widely exploited for various applications from material sciences [12] to the production of pharmaceuticals [13] and identification of allergen epitopes [14][15][16]. \n\nThis study presents the methodology for identifying protein-peptide interaction, using a relatively fast, cost-efficient and less labor-intensive protocol, implementing phage biopanning and NGS followed by bioinformatic analysis (Figures 1 and 2). We used the Ph.D. commercial system, which is based on a filamentous M13 phage vector that works as a physical linkage between each variant of a protein sequence and the DNA encoding it [17]. The pipeline for efficient identification of peptide binding partners using various computational tools for detailed data analysis is presented. As an example of the application of this protocol, we present the identification of immunologically relevant allergen Ves v 5 epitopes. Epitopes are molecular structures recognized by receptors of immune cells (T cells and B cells) and soluble antibodies in the process of immune responses [4]. They can be categorized as either continuous or discontinuous based on whether the residues constituting an epitope are contiguous or not. Continuous epitopes are usually short linear peptide stretches, whereas discontinuous epitopes correspond to several peptide stretches of contiguous residues brought into close proximity by protein folding in 3D space [5]. While all T cell epitopes are linear, B cell epitopes can be either linear or conformational and exposed on the surface of the allergen [6].",

            "text": "The existence of an exhaustible reservoir of peptides enables vaccine researchers to find potential mimotopes with high antigenicity and immunogenicity in phage display libraries. These rare functional mimotopes among a large population of nonfunctional peptides are assumed to be gems in the junk whose capacity for mimicking the antigenic structures can be used for immunostimulation. Another contribution of phage display to the field of vaccine production is its potential for the development of hybrid phage vaccines. These vaccine types are constructed by combining the two approaches of phage DNA vaccine and phage display vaccine. In this combinatorial platform, phage particles carry a foreign antigen-encoding gene in their genome and at the same time display a peptide or protein on their surface. The displayed peptide or protein may be a targeting molecule. For example, it can be selected through biopanning for its specific binding affinity towards APCs such as dendritic cells. Accordingly, hybrid phage vaccines can directly deliver the antigen-encoding sequence to immunoreactive cells. Affinity maturation can be performed through several rounds of library generation/mutagenesis and selection [142,143]. The selective enrichment of high-affinity antigen-specific ligands from second-generation libraries (SGLs) can be implemented by screening with lower concentration of the target antigen, shorter incubation times, longer or more extensive washing steps, and display of mutagenized molecules at a lower valency on phage particles. the establishment of SGLs relies on introducing mutations into the nucleotide sequence encoding the originally selected binder. Several methodologies are available for the purpose of mutagenesis. These methods generally fall into two categories of site-specific and random mutagenesis. Site-specific mutagenesis is performed through site-directed mutagenesis and cassette mutagenesis and random mutagenesis is achieved through error-prone PCR and DNA shuffling [142,144]. Also, next-generation sequencing (NGS) is recently gaining popularity in phage display. The traditional approach of phage display screening relies on multiple rounds of affinity selection that are followed by standard Sanger sequencing.",

            "text": "The traditional approach of phage display screening relies on multiple rounds of affinity selection that are followed by standard Sanger sequencing. Sanger sequencing is labor-intensive and low-throughput resulting in sequencing of inserts from a very limited number of phage clones (representing only < 0.01 % of the complete sequence space of the library) [145,146]. Also, repeated rounds of selection might lead this small sample space to be dominated by nonspecific binding sequences with faster amplification rates known as parasitic sequences [147] or with binding capacity to the components of the screening system in particular plastic surface of the solid support [148]. In this context, the final outcome is the isolation of false positive hits with no actual specific binding to the target at the end of biopanning. NGS provides the possibility to characterize >10 6 sequencing reads in a single run. Furthermore, this high-throughput characterization of the diversity of binding variants can be performed in earlier rounds of biopanning (after 1-2 rounds of selection on the desired target) [149]. Amplifications that are performed between selection rounds enhance the risk of introducing biological bias and collapse of the library diversity. By reducing the number of amplification rounds, the incorporation of NGS platforms into phage display screening decreases the chance of isolating nonspecific false positive clones and accelerates the process of target-specific ligand identification. \n\nBeyond doubt, phage display cannot bypass all barriers in the way of vaccine production and is not able to resolve all problems we might face in our efforts to generate ideal vaccines. However, it is crystal-clear that this powerful methodology can offer a wide variety of appropriate keys to unlock the doors ahead. Current situation promises a bright future for different phagebased vaccine platforms and it can be argued that the role of phage display will continue to grow in the coming years. With ongoing progress being made in the exploitation of phages for epitope mapping and antigen presentation, the research community hopes to find new tactics and strategies for vaccine discovery and development.",

            "text": "The present work identified three novel immunogenic oligopeptides from gut microbiota-derived metagenomes in a mouse model of Crohn's disease and thus demonstrates that ORFeome phage display is suitable to analyze metaproteomes. To date, ORFeome phage display technology was only used to identify immunogenic proteins from single organisms [35][36][37]39 . Ciric et al. 2014 used a similar technology for the enrichment for DNA inserts that contained an endogenous signal peptide and analyzed this secretome enriched library by next generation sequencing, but this approach did not include any functional screening 52,53 . Here, we present an approach that allows to identify immunogenic proteins from ORF-enriched phage display libraries based on specific protein interactions including functional selection from proteins of a metaproteome independent of cultivation, expression level or antigen size.\n\nCompared to phage display libraries covering genomes of one species, metagenomic approaches require larger libraries. Estimating the necessary library diversity to cover the whole metagenome remains difficult as the microbiome composition and relative abundance of the different species is not completely known and is highly individual-specific. The libraries constructed in the present work contained more than 10 7 individual clones. In a previous study, serological expression cloning (SEREX) of randomly fragmented metagenomic DNA from the caecum of C3H/HeJ Bir mice and screening of 6 \u00d7 10 5 pfu of the lambda expression libraries was sufficient to identify bacterial flagellin as immunogenic protein 19 . Moreover, SEREX relies on non-directional cloning of randomly fragmented DNA, so only a small fraction (typically less than 6%) of inserts usually results in open reading frames. Employing non-lytic M13 phage for the ORFeome phage display technology as in the present study not only allows the screening by monoclonal ELISA but also an ORF enrichment prior to selection. Hence, ORFeome phage display libraries contain a much lower number of junk fragments which can hamper functional selection by their stickiness. Although our libraries contained more than 10 7 clones and up to 20 Gbp, they presumably still not covered the entire metagenome. The human gut microbiome harbors several hundred different bacterial species 54",

            "text": "To illustrate the functionality, the constructed phage display nanobody library was used to pan against recombinant human 4IgB7-H3, which contained two V-type and two C-type Ig domains. The panning process was carried out first in B7-H3 protein-coated Maxisorp plate for two rounds. Bound phages were eluted using glycine buffer at a low pH and amplified for the following rounds of the selection process. To reduce unspecific binders, in the third round, a counter selection step was added (Figure 2A). Briefly, the amplified phage library from the previous round was added to blocked control wells without B7-H3 protein and incubated at room temperature for one hour. Subsequently, unbound phages were taken out and incubated with B7-H3-coated wells for another one hour. The bound phages in the B7-H3-coated wells were then washed, eluted, and designated as the positive selection pool (Figure 2A). Out of 92 randomly selected clones, 12 demonstrated specific binding to B7-H3 in the phage ELISA assay (Figure 2B). The Sanger sequencing of these positive clones revealed a uniform sequence, identifying the predominant binder named A6. To identify typical unspecific binders, bound phages in the control wells were also washed, eluted, and designated as a negative selection pool. \n\nDue to the limited throughput of the single-clone screening, NGS was applied to discover more binders (Figure 2C). The diversified region of the nanobodies eluted from each round was PCR-amplified, and the amplicons were examined by NGS. As expected, clone A6 ranked first in multiple NGS datasets throughout the panning process, including the round 1, round 2, and round 3 positive selection pools. In a phage display, sequences can be enriched but do not necessary need to gain specificity to the target antigen. Enrichment is a complex process that could be influenced by various factors, such as enhanced fitness during phage amplification due to the reduced toxicity of the inserted sequences or binding to non-target antigens (e.g., components found in blocking agents).",

We have also included all B cell antigens of pathogens from the IEDB [the largest resource for previously reported antigens (51)] as well as bacterial virulence factors from the VFDB (52). \n\nProteins from these species were functionally prioritized, including the groups of membrane proteins, secreted proteins, and motility proteins/flagella [the detailed process is described in (47)]. The flagellins studied in this work are based on this annotation. There are a few additional flagellins (originating from databases) that were not grouped in this way and manually added to table S1 (see column there). Especially for genes obtained from metagenomic sequencing, in part no functional annotations were available. Hence, protein functions were annotated by mapping to the UniRef90 database (uniref and uniref_func) (47), which is marked if applicable in figures and tables. \n\nThe PhIP-Seq experiments were carried out as outlined in a published protocol (46) with laboratory-specific modifications detailed in (47). In short, in each reaction, 3 \uf06dg of IgG from a person's serum sample (concentration measured by ELISA) was added to the phage library (4000-fold coverage of phages per library variant). The microbiota library was mixed in a 2:1 ratio with a 200-nucleotide oligomer 100,000 variant pool (65,77). \n\nThe antibody-phage mixture was mixed at 4\u00b0C overnight on a rotator.

            "text": "Next-generation sequencing techniques empower selection of ligands from phage-display libraries because they can detect low abundant clones and quantify changes in the copy numbers of clones without excessive selection rounds. Identification of errors in deep sequencing data is the most critical step in this process because these techniques have error rates >1%. Mechanisms that yield errors in Illumina and other techniques have been proposed, but no reports to date describe error analysis in phage libraries. Our paper focuses on error analysis of 7-mer peptide libraries sequenced by Illumina method. Low theoretical complexity of this phage library, as compared to complexity of long genetic reads and genomes, allowed us to describe this library using convenient linear vector and operator framework. We describe a phage library as N \u00d7 1 frequency vector n = ||ni||, where ni is the copy number of the ith sequence and N is the theoretical diversity, that is, the total number of all possible sequences. Any manipulation to the library is an operator acting on n. Selection, amplification, or sequencing could be described as a product of a N \u00d7 N matrix and a stochastic sampling operator (S a). The latter is a random diagonal matrix that describes sampling of a library. In this paper, we focus on the properties of S a and use them to define the sequencing operator (S e q). Sequencing without any bias and errors is S e q = S a\u2009IN, where IN is a N \u00d7 N unity matrix. Any bias in sequencing changes IN to a nonunity matrix. We identified a diagonal censorship matrix (C E N), which describes elimination or statistically significant downsampling, of specific reads during the sequencing process.",

            "text": "approach, epitope phage display libraries from specific regions of the human genome were enriched for coding exon sequences that bind to target proteins (i.e., antibodies). The approach was designed to maximize library diversity and the likelihood of exon display, and to minimize sequence space devoted to introns and stop codons. The intron-exon pattern of gene structure dictates that epitopes generated from genomic fragments will encode primarily linear, small exon-specific epitopes. For example, in silico sequence analyses of the 5q31 Interleukin gene region indicate that the majority of the exons within this region range between 100-300 bp (http://www.lbnl.gov/lifesciences). Variables related to genomic sequence, such as size of the target region (kilobase, megabase, etc.), gene location within six reading frames, stop codon frequency and in-frame sequences are important considerations in developing phage display-based coding exon identification. In addition, proper cloning orientation is required for successful pIII phage display. An insert sequence must be in-frame relative to the leader sequence and continue in-frame into the pIII sequence [3]. A stop codon within the insert sequence will cause a premature truncation of the peptide and prevent surface display. We used size selection strategies to optimize exon display from genomic fragments, derived from a 50 kb human P1 artificial chromosome, containing genes from the 5q31 Interleukin gene cluster. An epitope library from breast cancer cell cDNA was also was evaluated for gene specific protein-protein interactions.\n\nThe success and challenges of creating and screening epitope display libraries from large genomic fragments and cDNAs are discussed.",

To 145 demonstrate identification of novel pNbs using PANL, we performed a selection against EGFP-146 GPI-expressing HEK293T cells, while counter-selecting using parental HEK293T (Figure 2I). 147\n\nOver three selection rounds, we monitored the enrichment of pNbs by staining EGFP-GPI + cells, 148 revealing a steady increase of antigen-recognizing pNbs with each additional round ( Figure 2J). 149\n\nScreening of 94 clones after the final (third) selection demonstrated that at least 95% of clones 9 recognized EGFP-GPI + cells with strong binding (Q2/Q1 >1) (Figure 2K and Supp. Fig. 13). As 151 clones varied in their ability to bind EGFP-GPI + cells, we picked 7 clones (5 strong and 2 weak 152 binders) and sequenced their phagemid inserts.

Even if an immune library is required, rapid construction and screening is possible using cloning protocols such as MEGAWHOP which do not require prior digestion of PCR immunoglobulin sequences and new panning strategies that enable effective enrichment over only one cycle of selection (102,103). In addition, vectors have been developed that can express antibodies both on phage as well as in mammalian cell culture as full length IgG through the use of intron-mediated differential splicing without any need for sub-cloning, which enables rapid highthroughput expression analysis of the full length antibody (104). As such, phage display is likely to remain a key technique for antibody discovery for the foreseeable future.

            "text": "These increases in library complexity and the increased pressure for high-throughput screens against drug targets has demanded faster and more accurate DNA sequencing to ensure the correct candidate sequences are pursued. \n\nHigh-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies have massively increased the depth and coverage of phage display library sequences that emerge from any given panning experiment. HTS of peptide phage display outputs can produce extremely large volumes of DNA sequencing data (approximately 600 MB per dataset). After processing these data can reveal >1,000 peptide sequences of varying abundances after a single library panning round. \n\nThis has significantly increased the power and speed of recombinant display library screens. \n\nConcomitant with an increased surveillance of phage library diversity across consecutive panning rounds is the potential for distraction by either non-specific binding clones or phage clones that display a marginal growth advantage over other library clones, so called parasitic sequences (4). Non-specific binding clones can be selected against by protocol modification to enrich for specific binders. However, parasitic clones are an innate element of phage display libraries due to the randomised nature of the recombinant DNA included in their cloning. \n\nThe key aim of HTS of phage display outputs is to identify the abundance of specific sequences rather than consensus generation. Therefore, sequencing errors can have a profound effect on results because read length is short and linking of non-contiguous sequences, a process known as scaffolding, is not possible. Earlier MatLab with the base-calling process. This can either be a silent substitution where the base substitution translates into the same amino acid, or otherwise generates an entirely different amino acid when translated. More serious errors such as insertions and deletions (otherwise known as indels) can arise rarely due to failure to fully remove free bases in solution or remove fluorescent terminators from annealed bases, causing the formation of a leading/lagging signal, respectively (7). Indels in sequencing will cause frameshifts that result in the amino acids generated ahead of the indel base to be entirely misread. The unfeasibility of sequence scaffolding means that alternative methods are needed to mitigate the impact of these sequencing errors on the results generated from phage display HTS.",

            "text": "Broadly speaking, protein display approaches can be classified into two groups: those that require the peptide libraries to be cloned and expressed using cells (cellular) and those in which expression and display are achieved without the need for cells (acellular). One of the most widely used techniques for functional peptide selection is phage display, a cellular technique in which the library proteins are displayed by fusion to an outer coat protein of a bacteriophage. The diversity of phage display libraries is fundamentally limited by the efficiency by which bacteria can be transformed, and is therefore up to B10 9 variants. 5 Typically, in this system, a short random sequence (encoding peptides roughly 6 to 45 amino acids long 5,6 ) is fused to a phage coat protein (e.g., the minor coat protein pIII, or, for short peptides, the major coat protein pVIII of the filamentous phage M13). A library of phages is created with each phage particle displaying the sequence encoded on its individual genome. The recombinant phages are produced and amplified using E. coli, purified, and subjected to selective pressure, such as binding to a molecule attached to a solid support. By cycling through the amplification and selection steps, phages displaying peptides with a desired phenotype can be enriched. The phage itself links the genotype (carried in its genome) with the phenotype (expressed as a fusion to its proteinaceous coat), and selected peptides can be sequenced after sufficient enrichment. Phage display is suitable for selection of peptides that can be used in antibody development, study of protein-protein interactions, and mediation of protein-ligand interactions. 5,7 A limitation, however, is protein length, because peptides that are too long often interfere with phage assembly and/or infectivity, leading to an undesirable source of selection bias. 8 This can be somewhat mitigated by reducing the display valency, but other cellular approaches may be preferred when longer sequences are needed. Phage display has been extensively reviewed elsewhere. 9,10 The phage genotype-phenotype linkage is exploited in another cellular method, called Phage-Assisted Continuous Evolution (PACE). 11 In PACE, a library of plasmids encoding",

            "text": "Over the last two decades, many methods have been used to screen proteins, among which surface display technology were very important. To be specific, phage display was the most convenient method, besides bacterial and ribosomal screening methods (Goracci, Pignochino & Marchi\u00f2, 2020). Accordingly, the application of the method will increase in the future (Zambrano-Mila, Blacio & Vispo, 2020). \n\nExisting studies suggested that phage display technology will be combined with next generation sequencing to improve screening accuracy, reducing the occurrence of non-specific false positive clones. And it can speed up the identification process of target specific ligands (Lemire, Yehl & Lu, 2018). The use of phage display techniques to construct single chain antibody libraries for screening scFvs was elucidated in this review, and it had played an integral role in vaccine development and cancer treatment (Sokullu, Gauthier & Coulombe, 2021). Cancer kills around 10 million people worldwide each year (Torre et al., 2016). The main problems are the lack of methods to target drugs to tumor sites and the lack of therapeutic agents with high specificity (Lin et al., 2021). In contrast, phage antibodies are diverse tumor binding libraries that may be useful for potential therapeutic agents and the development of new diagnostics (Lindberg et al., 2021). The development of a human lung diagnostic protein microarray with novel screening markers using the T7 phage cDNA library has been reported previously. In contrast to the conventional identification of the presence of lung cancer by lung tumor markers, the novel phage library technology enabled patients to detect and treat cancer at an early stage (Hirsch et al., 2017). Previous research has demonstrated that phage display technology has been employed in the treatment of cancer and the treatment of infectious diseases (e.g., leprosy and infantile leishmaniasis) (Alban et al., 2014;Coelho et al., 2015;Alban et al., 2014). Combining cell surface-specific markers of parasitic infections with phage antibody libraries ultimately screens peptide compounds for the development of anti-parasitic drugs (Kuzmicheva & Belyavskaya, 2016).",

            "text": "Deep sequencing can be used as a validation tool for the design and engineering of synthetic Ab libraries [31,32]. Its implementation offers advantageous statistical insights concerning amino acid distributions at complementary determining regions (CDRs); such quantifiable observations ultimately help determine the critical residue positions associated with antigen interactions. Additionally, it can be an effective tool to understand the actual clonal diversity, completeness, redundancy, and biases found within Ab libraries; as such, this information helps improve/optimize the final design of a synthetic Ab library final [33][34][35]. More recently, deep sequencing has been introduced to help validate specific sequence-encoded Ab features, this has enabled the rapid optimization of Ab sequence lengths for improved antigen recognition [36,37]. Also, deep sequencing can provide quantitative insights from natural Ab repertoires, such information helps identify the critical features responsible for structural integrity, solubility, and affinity Fig. 1 Schematic describing natural versus synthetic Ab generation strategies. The top schematic shows the generation of natural Abs via animal/ human immunizations followed by either isolation of polyclonal Abs directly from blood serum (A1) or isolation of monoclonal Abs via hybridoma technologies involving the isolation and immortalization of monoclonal B-cells grown in culture (A2). The bottom schematic indicates the generation of synthetic Abs by molecular display methods (i.e. phage, yeast, ribosome, etc.). This example shows a phage-display synthetic Ab library undergoing in vitro selections against a target antigen. The selection is performed during multiple rounds to eventually enrich for antigen selective Ab binders. Individual phage clones are then isolated and via recombinant methods monoclonal synthetic Abs are generated (B1). More advanced methods utilize next-generation sequencing combined with advanced computational assessments to determine the clonal population profiles. Based on mathematical rankings, statistics, and various other computational approaches, individual clones are selected for recombinant protein expression, ultimately producing monoclonal synthetic Abs (B2) interactions. These observations can then be transferred to improve the design of synthetic Ab libraries [38,39]. When taken together, big data explorations offer a quantitative approach for the generation of fine-tuned and specialized synthetic Ab library designs (Table 4).",

            "text": "Finally, quantitative-PCR plus next-generation sequencing methodologies have not as yet been systematically compared to TU-counting plus Sanger sequencing in terms of speed, cost, and--most importantly--accuracy. \n\nThe next-generation phage display approach introduced here includes DNA-analysis of clones from the initial quantification steps to the final large-scale sequencing, which are relatively much faster and far less expensive. Replacement of bacterial overnight growth and TU-counting with DNA extraction and qPCR not only permits the quantification of non-infective/degraded phage, but it also yields phage homing results in only a few hours after tissue removal, simultaneously for dozens of samples in parallel. In real-time PCR phage quantification (qPhage), reproducible quantification was attained over a broad concentration range and was linear over at least eight orders of magnitude, far better than with the conventional approach and also much more sensitive than real-time PCR phage quantification reports [25][26]. \n\nOur qPhage strategy allows fast and precise validation of target tissue-specificity in the homing of selected phage or in large-scale evaluation of dozens of samples, which is particularly appealing for studies in vivo, including patients [29][30]. These goals are reachable with only small design modifications through simultaneous administration of multiple independent targeted phage particles in a single animal, followed by specific detection of each one with appropriate primers or probes in a multiplexed PCR. After homing validation, peptides shown after sequencing saturation of a number of vascular beds that appear to be specific to a particular target tissue, can be considered further as promising probes to be developed as agents for imaging and drug delivery in normal or tumor target sites. \n\nMinor drawbacks remain. Host bacteria are still required for phage library generation and amplification between screening rounds; given the phage life cycle, this is unlikely to change. Another potential drawback is the need to re-clone the phage of interest (if desired), after its displayed peptide is determined. Nevertheless, deep sampling of the targeted peptide repertoire leads to a more reliable phage selection, and the regeneration of the selected particle(s) of interest can easily be accomplished with straightforward cloning protocols.",

            "text": "Phage immunoprecipitation sequencing (PhIP-Seq) involves displaying a synthetic library of peptide or protein fragments of between 40 and 90 amino acids on bacteriophage. An oligonucleotide library encoding the fragments is amplified and cloned into a T7 phage display system [32,33]. The phage library is incubated with sera, and phage bound by serum IgG is precipitated with protein A/G coated magnetic beads [33,34]. The fragment displayed (phenotype) is linked with the fragment encoded within the genome of each phage (genotype) so that next-generation sequencing of precipitated phage provides insight into serum antigen specificity. Once a phage library has been constructed, the immunoprecipitation and sequence data can be collected within 1 week, making the technique quick and affordable [31].\n\nThe affordability and depth of data that can be obtained from PhIP-seq has led to its increasing use in autoimmune disease research (Table 1) including type-1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis [32], autoimmune encephalitis [35], and most recently the post-COVID-19, multi-inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) [36]. As display technologies are adaptable to a 96-well format, sample throughput is high. The depth of data obtained, as result of the incorporation of next-generation sequencing approaches, has highlighted the huge diversity of autoantibody reactivity between individuals. These unique autoantibody fingerprints maybe a hallmark of autoimmune disease that is only beginning to be appreciated [27,37].",

            "text": "Phage-based techniques have emerged as alternatives to SERPA and protein/peptide microarrays. The phage species used in phage displays are viruses with protein envelopes derived from the ORFs of the phage. By modifying the genome of the phage to display a protein or peptide as a fusion protein, one of the phage coat proteins on the surface can be achieved. This genotype-to-phenotype link makes it possible to use DNA sequencing to determine what protein or peptide is displayed. Phage display was first described by GP Smith in 1985 (23), where he inserted a 171 bp long DNA fragment coding for parts of the EcoRI endonuclease gene into the pIII gene of the filamentous phage f1 and managed to amplify it compared to the background M13 phage by binding it with an antibody, and he postulated that using a library of random inserts could be used in selection (23). Phage display has the advantage that after library production, the same library can be used in thousands of selections, decreasing the cost per serum sample tested. In the mid-2000s, phage display began to be used for antigen discovery, where complementary DNA (cDNA) from patients was cloned and inserted into vectors accounting for the three different translation frames to create libraries of 10 6 theoretical library sizes and used in standard phage display experiments with serum from patients immobilized on the surface as bait, with serum from healthy people used as preselection. Through several rounds of selection with amplification steps in bacteria (24), individual clones from the selection were picked through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (24) or through incorporation into a protein microarray (25,26), and positive clones were sequenced through Sanger sequencing. This approach has been used to find antigens for autoantibodies and disease-specific antibodies from serum (24)(25)(26). It can also detect antigen-antibody interactions based on both structural and linear epitopes, although information about the specific epitope is lacking. One of the disadvantages of cDNA display is that a large portion of the library contains out-of-frame proteins, in some cases as much as 94% of the library (27).",

            "text": "DIR and EKIEGR were added for promoting trypsin elution. Also the myc-tag contains a lysine, which sensitizes the p9-Fab construction to trypsin cleavage at this region.\n\nColony counts of the transformed libraries varied from 1\u00d710 9 to 6\u00d710 9 cfu per library ( Table 1). Quality of the Fab genes was analysed by sequencing 24 single clones from pEB30-Fab library transformation, of which 20/24 clones contained changes according to the library design and 2/24 clones contained frameshifts ( Table 1). The remaining two clones contained a CDR-H3 loop shorter or longer than designed. Similar share of functional clones was anticipated from the other libraries prior to phage packing, as the same Fab cassette pool was used in ligations and the Lac P/O-driven expression of the fusion gene products was continuously suppressed with glucose.\n\nThe libraries were superinfected with VCS-M13 for monovalent display, and the Fab-p3 repertoire also with hyperphage for oligovalent display. Hyperphage is a helper phage, which does not provide any wild type p3 for particle assembly and therefore, all p3 originates from the phagemid leading to forced oligovalent display of the protein of interest [15]. Consequently, hyperphage was not used for the superinfection of the p9 or truncated p3 display libraries as this would result in noninfective phage. After the first round of panning with the Fab-p3 oligovalent library, the cells were infected with hyperphage and VCS-M13 in parallel. By the latter strategy, the possible benefits provided by the oligovalent display format on the first round were coupled to the increased selection stringency provided by the monovalent display on following rounds. A library propagated by this manner is referred to as hyper > VCS in continuation.\n\nAfter phage production, a sample of each library was infected to XL-1 Blue and plated on selective agar plates for picking and growing colonies for sequencing. The single phage-packing cycle decreased the proportion of variants with open reading frames (ORF) in the pEB30-Fab libraries from the previously observed 92",

            "text": "Kato & Hanyu (2013) expanded the library capacity of the antibody libraries by enzymatic assembly. They established scFv by enzymatic assembly of VL and VH structural domains using synergistic action of \u03bb-exonuclease and Bst DNA polymerase. In contrast, Yang et al. (2009) used a \u03b2-lactamase selection strategy to enlarge the functional variety of the libraries. They fused the installation of scFv genes sequence to the 5\u2032 end of the \u03b2-lactamase genes and performed scFv cloning by penicillin choice. Sblattero & Bradbury (1998) adopted the Cre recombinase method, which the vector comprises two non-homologous Loxp sites, to build the large capacity human derived natural antibody libraries. The Cre-Loxp system was adopted to amplify the variety of the library. \n\nIn 1990, McCafferty et al. (1990) ) constructed an antibody library with a library capacity of 106 and successfully screened lysozyme scFvs from it. Phage display technology became an emerging means of antibody preparation in antibody engineering (McCafferty et al., 1990). The scFv gene was displayed on the surface of the phage through phage infection, which was screened from the phage display single chain antibody libraries using specific antigens. The final antigen enrichment was achieved after several rounds of screening (Baca et al., 1997). ELISA assayed the binding activity of the screened phage with the target molecule, and scFv was obtained after DNA sequencing. Currently, phage display single chain antibody libraries technology had an indispensable role in vaccine development and tumor therapy. We described the advantages of screening scFv using phage display technology and summarized the differences between T4, T7, \u03bb and M13 phages. We also discussed the use of solid phase and liquid phase screening for scFv and phage antibody libraries applications.",

            "text": "Display technologies have driven the modern development of NBEs; in particular, phage display and yeast display are widely used for the generation of therapeutic antibodies. In general, a peptide or protein library with diverse sequence variety is generated by PCR, or other recombination techniques [59]. The library is \"displayed\" for genotypephenotype linkage such that the protein is expressed and fused to surface proteins while the encoding gene is still encapsulated within the phage or cell. Therefore, the library could be screened and selected, in a process coined \"biopanning\", against the target (e.g. antigen) according to binding affinity. Thereafter, the selected peptides are further optimised by repeating the process with a refined library. In phage display, selection works by physical capture and elution [128]; for cell-based display technologies (like yeast display), fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) is utilised for selection [18]. \n\nDue to the repeated iteration of experimental screens and the high number of outputs, such display technologies are now being coupled to ML systems for greater speed, affinity and further in silico selection [154,204]. As of yet, it does not appear that advanced ML architectures have been applied in this domain, but promising routes forward have been recently developed. For example, Hawkins-Hooker et al. [71] trained multiple variational autoencoders on the amino acid sequences of 70,000 luciferase-like oxidoreductases to generate new functional variants of the luxA bacterial luciferase. Testing these experimentally led to variants with increased enzyme solubility without disrupting function. Using this philosophy, one has a grounded approach to refine libraries for a directed evolution screen. 4.3.3 Protein engineering. Some proteins have reliable scaffolds that one can build upon, for example, antibodies whereby one could modify the variable region but leave the constant region intact. For example, Deac et al. [44] used dilated (\u00e1 trous) convolutions and self-attention on antibody sequences to predict the paratope (the residues on the antibody that interact with the antigen) as well as a cross-modal attention mechanism between the antibody and antigen sequences.",

            "text": "Because of their large population sizes, short generation times, small genome sizes and ease of manipulation, various filamentous and non-filamentous bacteriophages have been used as models of experimental evolution (reviewed in Husimi, 1989;Wichman and Brown, 2010;Kawecki et al., 2012;Hall et al., 2013). The filamentous phage has additional practical uses in protein engineering and directed protein evolution, due to its unique tolerance of genetic modifications that allow biomolecules to be displayed on the virion surface. First and foremost among these applications is in vitro affinity maturation of antibody fragments displayed on pIII. Libraries of variant Fabs and single chain antibodies can be generated via random or sitedirected mutagenesis and selected on the basis of improved or altered binding, roughly mimicking the somatic evolution strategy of the immune system (Marks et al., 1992;Bradbury et al., 2011). However, other in vitro display systems, such as yeast display, have important advantages over the filamentous phage for affinity maturation (although each display technology has complementary strengths; Koide and Koide, 2012), and regardless of the display method, selection of \"improved\" variants can be slow and cumbersome. Iterative methods have been developed to combine computationally designed mutations (Lippow et al., 2007) and circumvent the screening of combinatorial libraries, but these have had limited success to date. \n\nRecently, Esvelt et al. (2011) developed a novel strategy for directed evolution of filamentous phage-displayed proteins, called phage-assisted continuous evolution (PACE), which allows multiple rounds of evolution per day with little experimental intervention. The authors engineered M13 phage to encode an exogenous protein (the subject for directed evolution), whose functional activity triggers gene III expression from an accessory plasmid; variants of the exogenous protein arise by random mutagenesis during phage replication, the rate of which can be increased by inducible expression of error-prone DNA polymerases.",

            "text": "In this study, we applied phage display technology with the aim of searching for peptide ligands that bind to M. tb, and can be later developed to probe for potential biomarkers in patients' clinical samples. We evaluated four phage clones that were identified from the panning of a loop-constrained heptapeptide (CX 7 C) library against M. tb. Both HTP sequencing and random clone picking revealed multiple peptides that were enriched during selection. However, only with HTP sequencing were we able to calculate quantitative measures of enrichment, which allowed us to compare and to rank our multiple hits. We found that our most enriched peptide which was identified only by HTP sequencing had the highest binding signal to Mtb when compared to all of the randomly selected clones and the unselected library. A single phage clone, phage 1, displaying the peptide CPLHARLPC, was significantly enriched during the selection. Interestingly, the traditional random clone picking method failed to identify this clone, despite the fact that HTP sequencing showed that this clone represented over 80% of the sequenced population after the first three rounds of selection ( Figure 3B). This result is in agreement with earlier findings showing that when comparing HTP sequencing to the traditional clone picking method, HTP sequencing accelerates the discovery of specific binders [19]. This earlier independent study supports our finding by demonstrating the high correlation between abundances in the first round and subsequent rounds of selection, clearly showing that HTP sequencing could identify the highly enriched clones without the need of additional selection rounds [19]. The higher resolution of the selection pools enabled by HTP sequencing also allowed us to characterize the enrichment process. Firstly, by demonstrating the reduction in the number of unique peptides during biopanning ( Figure 3A), which is indicative of the enrichment of a subset of phages. Secondly, by revealing that phage 1 was significantly enriched to 80% of the sequenced population as early as round 3 ( Figure 3B). Attaining this kind of quantitative data would not be possible using random clone picking, since this method is limited by the number of clones that can be analyzed. This means that it will be improbable to achieve the sequencing depth similar to that of HTP sequencing, making it more difficult to evaluate the degree of enrichment of the selected",

            "text": "Phage display technology has been widely used for antibody affinity maturation for decades. The limited library sequence diversity together with excessive redundancy and labour-consuming procedure for candidate identification are two major obstacles to widespread adoption of this technology. We hereby describe a novel library generation and screening approach to address the problems. The approach started with the targeted diversification of multiple complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of a humanized anti-ErbB2 antibody, HuA21, with a small perturbation mutagenesis strategy. A combination of three degenerate codons, NWG, NWC, and NSG, were chosen for amino acid saturation mutagenesis without introducing cysteine and stop residues. In total, 7,749 degenerate oligonucleotides were synthesized on two microchips and released to construct five single-chain antibody fragment (scFv) gene libraries with 4 x 106 DNA sequences. Deep sequencing of the unselected and selected phage libraries using the Illumina platform allowed for an in-depth evaluation of the enrichment landscapes in CDR sequences and amino acid substitutions. Potent candidates were identified according to their high frequencies using NGS analysis, by-passing the need for the primary screening of target-binding clones. Furthermore, a subsequent library by recombination of the 10 most abundant variants from four CDRs was constructed and screened, and a mutant with 158-fold increased affinity (Kd = 25.5 pM) was obtained. These results suggest the potential application of the developed methodology for optimizing the binding properties of other antibodies and biomolecules.",

The phage display technology coupled with deep sequencing was introduced more than a decade ago and holds the potential to circumvent the traditional laborious picking and testing of individual phage rescued clones.

InteractomeSeq is a web server allowing data analysis of protein domains (\u2018domainome\u2019) or epitopes (\u2018epitome\u2019) from either Eukaryotic or Prokaryotic genomic phage libraries generated and selected by following an Interactome sequencing approach. InteractomeSeq allows users to upload raw sequencing data and to obtain an accurate characterization of domainome/epitome profiles after setting the parameters required to tune the analysis.

            "text": "The existence of millions of potential interfaces driven by linear motifs provides a large interaction landscape requiring novel tools to dissect signaling mechanisms (Tompa et al., 2014). An example is the use of ribosome display that can select for peptides binding to a target from a combinatorial pool (Fuchs et al., 2013). We have set up a robust next-generation peptide-phage library screening assay to identify peptide aptamers that could be used as tools to dissect ubiquitin reaction mechanisms. The peptide libraries are derived from bacteriophage-peptide combinatorial libraries (Smith, 1985) that are screened against a target antigen. Iterative cycles of screening and amplification can select for peptides that bind with a high specificity for a target protein and has been used previously on the E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2 (Bottger et al., 1996;Burch et al., 2004). This method is labor intensive and always limited to an analysis of a maximum of dozens of phage clones, analyzed usually one by one. Thus, a limitation of the approach methodologically has been the low sequencing throughout of individual selected bacteriophage. Here, we exploit next-generation sequencing methodologies to deep sequence bacteriophage-peptide pools selected against Ubiquitin. With the advance of next-generation sequencing, it is now possible to sequence thousands of inserts in parallel (Dias-Neto et al., 2009;Derda et al., 2010Derda et al., , 2011)), which we now use to identify specific peptides that bind to a target protein (ubiquitin).

            "text": "In the last decade however, it has been learned that in addition to the specificity and affinity, other properties account for the success of a therapeutic antibody in clinical trials. Such properties, collectively called developability [18,19], include (but are not limited to) cross-reactivity against the human target and orthologs from relevant tox species and animal models, solubility, expression yield in manufacturing cells, and thermal and long-term stability. Since these properties are encoded in the amino acid sequence of the antibody, there has been a strong demand to generate phage display antibody libraries that not only enable the selection of highly specific and high affinity antibodies, but also those that are more developable. \n\nAs a result, numerous phage display antibody libraries have been built after the seminal work by John McCafferty and Gregory Winter in 1990 [6]. These libraries, their construction process, validation with diverse targets, and applications of the selected antibodies to diagnostic and/or therapeutic settings have been extensively reviewed in the literature [20][21][22][23][24][25]. Here, given the vast amount of information pertaining to phage display, compounded with space limitations, we review nine phage display scFv and Fab libraries published in the last decade (Table 1). These nine libraries are the latest generation of phage display antibody libraries and represent the state-of-the-art platforms for human therapeutic antibody discovery. We first discuss the functionality of the libraries in terms of size, quality, and diversity of the antibody repertoires. Second, we review and compare the outcome of the selection processes, i.e., the number of positive clones, hit rate, and affinity of the selected antibodies. Third, we discuss the performance of the libraries in terms of the developability of the selected antibodies. Finally, we highlight current opportunities and challenges relating to phage display platforms and other display technologies.",

Display technologies have driven the modern development of NBEs; in particular, phage display and yeast display are widely used for the generation of therapeutic antibodies. In general, a peptide or protein library with diverse sequence variety is generated by PCR, or other recombination techniques [194]. The library is \"displayed\" for genotypephenotype linkage such that the protein is expressed and fused to surface proteins while the encoding gene is still encapsulated within the phage or cell. Therefore, the library could be screened and selected, in a process coined \"biopanning\", against the target (e.g. antigen) according to binding affinity. Thereafter, the selected peptides are further optimised by repeating the process with a refined library. In phage display, selection works by physical capture and elution [195]; for cell-based display technologies (like yeast display), fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) is utilised for selection [196].\n\nDue to the repeated iteration of experimental screens and the high number of outputs, such display technologies are now being coupled to ML systems for greater speed, affinity and further in silico selection [197,198]. As of yet, it does not appear that advanced GML architectures have been applied in this domain, but promising routes forward have been recently developed. For example, Hawkins-Hooker et al. [199] trained multiple variational autoencoders on the amino acid sequences of 70,000 luciferase-like oxidoreductases to generate new functional variants of the luxA bacterial luciferase. Testing these experimentally led to variants with increased enzyme solubility without disrupting function. Using this philosophy, one has a grounded approach to refine libraries for a directed evolution screen.",

            "text": "Based on the ideas described in Parmley and Smith (1988), groups in California, Germany, and the UK developed phage-display platforms to create and screen libraries of peptide and folded-protein variants (Bass et al., 1990;Devlin et al., 1990;McCafferty et al., 1990;Scott and Smith, 1990;Breitling et al., 1991;Kang et al., 1991). This technology allowed, for the first time, the ability to seamlessly connect genetic information with protein function for a large number of protein variants simultaneously, and has been widely and productively exploited in studies of proteinprotein interactions. Many excellent reviews are available on phage-display libraries and their applications (Kehoe and Kay, 2005;Bratkovic, 2010;Pande et al., 2010). However, the phage also has a number of unique structural and biological properties that make it highly useful in areas of research that have received far less attention. \n\nThus, the purpose of this review is to highlight recent and current work using filamentous phage in novel and nontraditional applications. Specifically, we refer to projects that rely on the filamentous phage as a key element, but whose primary purpose is not the generation or screening of phagedisplayed libraries to obtain binding polypeptide ligands. These tend to fall into four major categories of use: (i) filamentous phage as a vaccine carrier; (ii) engineered filamentous phage as a therapeutic biologic agent in infectious and chronic diseases; (iii) filamentous phage as a scaffold for bioconjugation and surface chemistry; and (iv) filamentous phage as an engine for evolving variants of displayed proteins with novel functions. A final section is dedicated to recent developments in filamentous phage ecology and phage-host interactions. Common themes shared amongst all these applications include the unique biological, immunological, and physicochemical properties of the phage, its ability to display a variety of biomolecules in modular fashion, and its relative simplicity and ease of manipulation.",

Fig. 3 shows the phage titers in the washing buffers, reaction buffers, and elution buffers saved from each cycle. The wash of the Ni-NTA beads after the enzymatic reaction released the enzymatically cleaved phage particles (RW1-3 of cycle 1 in Fig. 3). Still, a large portion of the phage particles remained intact bound to the washed Ni-NTA beads (see E1-3 of cycle 1 in Fig. 3). As the cycles progressed, the fraction of the cleavable phage particles increased. In the last cycle, more than half of the phage population on the Ni-NTA beads was able to be released because of the fXa reaction. The progressive increase of the portion of the cleavable phage particles indicated that the selection/amplification cycle was effective in enriching the phage particles displaying substrate peptides for fXa. \n\nWe had a concern that some library members with consecutive His in the substrate sequences might be selected by Ni-NTA beads in the above selection cycles, even though the more competitive His 6 tag remained the predominant binding moiety to the Ni-NTA-coated surface. This possibility was investigated by sequencing random phage variants in the elution buffers (E1-3, see Fig. 2). No overpopulated His-biased sequences were found, suggesting that our substrate phage display system did not bias the distribution of His in fXa-cleavable sequences. \n\nAfter the last selection/amplification cycle with the pC-4X library, 96 single colonies of the host E. coli cells infected with the selected phage particles were picked for single colony analysis. Of the 96 single colonies, 31 phage variants satisfied the criteria (see \"Experimental Procedures\") for enzymatic kinetics measurement with quantitative ELISA.",

            "text": "Phage display libraries based on M13 filamentous bacteriophage can present a vast diversity of antibody fragments on the pIII minor coat protein, utilising either a phagemid or phage vector system to encode the antibody-coat protein fusion (the different display systems including mutated helper phage are reviewed elsewhere, [1][2][3]). The presence of the antibody on the surface of the phage particle is accompanied by the gene for the antibody being packaged within the phage. In this way the phenotype (antibody binding) and the genotype (antibody gene) are linked [2]. Within standard panning methods, the highly diverse antibody library is introduced to an immobilised antigen and unbound phage washed away, bound phage are then eluted, usually by a shift in pH and the resulting sub-library propagated in Escherichia coli to amplify each phage clone. Such panning cycles are usually carried out 3-5 times to enrich for phage-antibodies that bind to the target antigen and hundreds of single phage clones are then isolated, propagated and tested in ELI-SAs [2]. More recently, screening has used next generation sequencing platforms to sequence thousands to millions of antibody genes contained within the selected sub-libraries of phage after panning. Sequencing usually targets the whole VH or the CDRH3 domain. These methods allow a thorough investigation of the enrichment of phage clones, even when they are minor components of the sub-libraries [4][5][6]. Phage display libraries can enable the identification of a variety of antibodies with desirable binding properties including antibodies that bind to toxic or non-immunogenic antigens. \n\nNaturally occurring or designed antibody domains have been developed that are suited for phage display but still retain the binding properties of a full-length IgG (Fig. 1). These domains include antigen binding fragments (Fab), single chain Fv (scFv) and single domain antibodies (nanobodies). The latter include camelid V H H and shark V NAR (New Antigen Receptor). \n\nPhage antibody libraries are classed as na\u00efve, semisynthetic, synthetic or immune libraries [2].",

            "text": "Library size is critical for the probability of discovering a variant with high target affinity in a surface-display system. 3 Depending on the system, 10 9-13 phenotypes can be prepared in a library, so a variant library can cover all possible variants with 7-10 residues being randomized. The use of degenerate codons and trinucleotide cassettes in genetic library preparation enables us to decrease the number of amino acids at mutagenized positions, 4,9 which limits library size expansion by excluding undesirable variants.\n\nThese advances increase the probability of obtaining a variant with high affinity for the target. However, the prepared library does not always cover the size of the surveyed sequence space, so the selected variant may not be the one with optimal affinity, or no variant may be selected at all. Machine learning has been applied to surface-display systems to predict the sequence-function landscape. 10,11 This approach can potentially discover the variant with optimal affinity in the surveyed sequence space. The round-to-round enrichment data from the biopanning of a phage pool displaying Fab fragments with a randomized CDR3 region in the heavy chain has been used to train an ensemble of neural network models. 24 The use of training data with 10-fold enrichment led to the identification of a target-specific variant with an EC 50 of 0.29 nM, which was 1.7-fold stronger than the affinity of a variant obtained from deep sequencing analysis. A Fab fragment with low target affinity has been matured by using a long short-term memory network trained with the deep sequencing data of round-to-round comparison; 21 machine learning discovered variants with affinity 10 times that of a matured variant found experimentally by using only deep sequencing analysis.\n\nAlthough an appropriately enriched library offers potential for discovering the optimal variant, in our study undesirable variants were amplified at the infection and amplification steps ( Figure 3); consequently, no enrichment in the round-toround comparison was observed ( Figure S3) and no functional variants were identified ( Figure S1). In this situation, the variants with binding function may be less efficiently enriched during selection than the undesirable variants that tend to be strongly enriched at the infection step. Here, we used the round-to-round comparison before and after the selection step",

We hypothesize that such processing defects, such as incorrect cleavage of the signal sequence, hinder cPTM that rely on the presence of properly processed N-terminal Ser residue. \n\nWe hope that this report serves as the first step in both the open reporting of library composition, as well as the development of a standardized framework for evaluating and sharing data that describes the diversity of libraries. The characterization procedure used in this report describes a simple analysis pipeline that can be applied to many types of libraries. We propose that the cloning of a compact, complete library of the same composition into different phage constructs or other display constructs could be adopted as a standard operating procedure for characterization of the advantages and disadvantages of specific display platforms. It can also be used to test and validate new methods for overcoming these biases: for example, we demonstrated that growth-enhanced \"parasite clones\" can be suppressed through emulsion amplification 22,58 . Similarly, in the context of SELEX, it has been demonstrated that similar emulsion-based compartmentalization could be used to suppress \"parasite\" oligonucleotide sequences 27,59 . Evaluation of performance of emulsion amplification and similar methods in compact libraries of complete diversity can further confirm the ability of these methods to mitigate bias. \n\nThe analysis presented here was empowered by modern deep sequencing capabilities; still, it highlights a few of the remaining deficiencies, such as the low confidence in the accuracy of analysis of low-copy-number sets in na\u00efve libraries.

            "text": "In the next step of phage display, screening of such libraries, which present a huge variety (~10 9 ) of random peptide sequences, allows for a high-throughput selection of peptides with the desired binding properties, without a priori knowledge. The desired phage-displayed peptides are separated by binding affinity purification and their sequence is obtained by DNA sequencing of the corresponding phage clones [31,33,34]. Originally developed to display peptides, the phage display method has evolved over the years to present antibodies [35], T-cell receptors, enzymes, proteomes, secretomes, and the so-called alternative affinity scaffolds [36]. Phage display has already proved useful in the selection of functional biomolecules for some of the most challenging targets in the biomedical field. Several phage display-derived peptides were approved by the FDA for the treatment of various diseases [37]. \n\nIn this work, with the use of phage display, we aimed to develop an engineered M13 phage that exposes a new, in vitro-identified Au-binding peptide capable of synthesizing AuNPs overnight under benign conditions. Such phages could be employed for biogenic, bottom-up synthesis and manipulation of gold nanostructures particularly for further biological applications, which have considerable concerns over contamination.",

            "text": "Phages are viruses that use their host bacterial cells as factories for their own replication and have the ability to display peptides or proteins on their surfaces. This technology is called phage display. Phage display can be used as a powerful tool to screen for affinity reagents for all kind of targets, ranging from small molecules to proteins and even cells. This selection can be performed by using phage libraries consisting of a high number of different phages (10 8 -10 10 ), each displaying a different peptide or protein on its surface. Among the huge number of phages in these phage libraries, the ones with high affinity and specificity for a target can be isolated in an affinity selection procedure (Fig. 1). Moreover, the proteins and peptides displayed on these selected phages can be identified by sequencing the gene coding for the displayed protein or peptide. This coding gene can be found in the singlestranded DNA (ssDNA) inside the selected phage. The target specific phages can be used as affinity reagents in diagnostic tests. Besides the target specific phages, the soluble peptides or proteins, released from the phage coat, can also be used as affinity reagents. These peptides or proteins are then produced synthetically or by recombinant expression in bacterial cells. Different types of phage libraries exist, displaying different types of peptides or proteins: peptides, cellular proteins (from cDNA libraries) or antibody fragments, like single chain variable fragments (scFv) and antigen binding fragment (Fab). Antibody fragment phage libraries are used commonly in immunology (Hoogenboom et al. 1998). Their wide diversity enables them to imitate the natural immune system. Phage display enables the production of sizeable amounts of the affinity reagents, avoiding the batch to batch variations which occur with classical antibodies. Moreover, there is no immune response required to produce affinity reagents for a target, making the selection of affinity reagents for poorly immunogenic targets possible. Peptide phage libraries can also be used to select affinity reagents, since the binding site, or epitope, only involves a few amino acids. Besides the monovalent phages that display one peptide on the phage surface, so-called landscape phages are also used as affinity reagents",

            "text": "After carrying out 16 cycles of positive and negative selections, we selected and analyzed a total of 24 phage libraries from different stages in the process to assess the sequence variation and evolution of the riboswitch population. During this analysis, we studied smaller library samples comprising 10 5 reads across the 16 selection cycles. This sample size was deemed appropriate as it encompassed the maximal diversity of the riboswitch www.nature.com/scientificreports/ library, containing 65,536 variants. The selection process entailed using 1.5 mM theophylline for the phage populations before the 10th generation, while 1 mM theophylline was employed for each generation thereafter to impose a more rigorous selection. Figure 5A and B illustrate the outcome of the analysis, displaying diagrams of the 8 randomized nucleotides, encased by 5 fixed nucleotides on either side. The size assigned to each nucleotide in the diagram directly reflects the number of times it is present in that position amongst all reads. This thorough analysis unfolded across multiple libraries, as enumerated in Table S1, and spanned diverse phases of the selection trajectory. Each step carries the label \"cmk\" or \"pifA\", identifying its association with either positive or negative selection. In the wake of the selection and evolutionary process, these diagrams afford valuable insights, underscoring the dynamic shifts in nucleotide preferences and mutations within the riboswitch sequences. \n\nOur next-generation sequencing (NGS) data analysis for various libraries yielded intriguing results. As demonstrated in Fig. 5A and B, the initial set of sequences analyzed reveals no overt dominance of any sequence. However, a dwindling variation within each phage population becomes apparent with the advancement of selection steps, suggesting a convergent evolution towards a prevailing sequence. This pattern aligns well with past studies 9,28 that report a favored nucleotide, such as G, in position 8. \n\nIn a subsequent round of NGS scrutiny, most of the sequences echo this pattern of diminishing variation across generations alongside the rise of a dominant sequence. Yet, a subset of libraries (S23 in A and S19, S20, S21, S22, and S24 in B) display a heightened variation.",

The reads were demultiplexed using the barcode sequences and filtered by discarding sequences with a Phred quality score under 30. Sequences were mapped to the original library using Bowtie (Langmead et al, 2009) with two mismatches between reads and library sequence. Nucleotide mutations leading to amino acid substitutions were subsequently removed. Cutoff values of NGS counts were assigned for each pool. PWMs were generated based on the remaining peptides (aligned on the C-termini) using WebLogo (Crooks et al, 2004).\n\nA correlation (Pearson correlation as implemented in R) analysis of the sequences obtained from the binding-enriched phage pools with the sequencing counts of the initial library showed that there is a higher probability that a peptide that is present in high count in the na\u00efve library to be selected during the phage display at all and therefore a relationship between the representation of a peptide in the library to the screens sensitivity ( Fig EV1). However, there was no significant correlation of the actual read counts (selection \"strength\") and the initial representation in the library, reflecting the strong selection during phage display (wt+mimetic: P-value: 0.49, q = \u00c00.08, mimetic only: P-value: 0.069, q = \u00c00.2, wt only: P-value: 0.12, q = 0.17). Consequently, the amount of reads for each binder after phage display is not a function of the amount of input reads in the na\u00efve library and no modeling based on the input library frequencies to score the interactions is necessary. To allow for comparison between replicate selections, we used the fraction of NGS reads within a certain set, instead of the absolute number of NGS reads, as the absolute numbers differ between different NGS batches.",

            "text": "The development of specific protein binders, based on antibodies or alternative scaffolds, has been instrumental for acquiring new knowledge regarding the natural presence and activities of proteins, as well as supplying new therapeutic agents. Binders are routinely selected from large protein libraries using display technologies such as phage, cell, or ribosome display (Smith, 1985;McCafferty et al., 1990;Frenzel et al., 2016;Dreier and Pl\u00fcckthun, 2018;Jaroszewicz et al., 2022). \n\nThe phage display system allows for easy scale-up and parallelization, meaning the possibility to select with multiple tracks for numerous targets simultaneously. However, the selection process requires a lot of manual work and handling multiple tracks quickly becomes cumbersome, particularly when selecting in solution with biotinylated target proteins, followed by capture on streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. Panning with the target proteins in solutions is preferred over surface panning as it allows the target molecule to be more accessible and reduces the role of avidity favoring high-affinity interactions (Zimmermann et al., 2020). The workload of this multi-step panning can be tremendously reduced by automation using robotics in the form of a particle processor. Automation and implementation of a plate-based format allows for increased throughput and reproducibility, decreased hands-on time and in addition to that, less consumables needed. However, systems for automated panning already in use require very high-priced equipment, making it unaffordable for many labs (Ch'ng et al., 2019). Furthermore, automation of the selection process alone shifts the bottleneck further to the screening and evaluation part of the workflow. Traditionally, phage display selections are followed by screening of single clones using ELISA combined with Sanger sequencing. While this is a straightforward strategy, it is usually limited to a couple hundred clones, resulting in only a snapshot of the whole selection output. To overcome this limitation, next-generation, also called high-throughput or deep sequencing is used for the identification of large selection outputs.",

Similarly, Throsby et al., using combinatorial display libraries constructed from human memory B cells elicited by seasonal influenza vaccination, isolated 13 antibodies exhibiting broad heterosubtypic neutralizing activity against antigenically diverse H1, H2, H5, H6, H8 and H9 influenza subtypes (84). The most potent antibody was also protective in mice when given before and after lethal H5N1 or H1N1 challenge and the epitope was localized to the highly conserved Therapeutic antibodies from phage display 653 membrane-proximal stem of the HA1 and HA2 subunits of hemagglutinin (84,85). \n\nUsing a combination of panning strategies against the hemagglutinin from several antigenically distinct H5N1 isolates to bias-selection of antibodies towards more conserved domains of the protein, we were able to isolate similar antibodies to that described by Throsby et al. from a non-immune Fab phage display library (11). The selection of such antibodies from even non-immune phage displayed libraries highlights the potential of these readily available libraries for the development of therapeutically relevant antibodies against emerging pathogens of high concern and may enable more rapid development of therapies against novel emergent pathogens in the future.",

Briefly, open reading frame (ORF) phage display (OPD) cDNA libraries, constructed from mouse adult eyes and E18 embryos, were amplified in BLT5616 E. coli, combined to increase gene representation, and purified using CsCl gradient centrifugation, followed by dialysis against PBS. The purified phages (1 \u00d7 10 12 pfu/well) in PBS supplemented with 0.5% BSA were added to anti-CD31-captured ECs or anti-CD90.2-captured RGCs in 24-well plates. After incubation at 37 \u2022 C for 1 h, unbound phages were removed by washing with PBS (two, three, and four times for Round 1, 2, and 3, respectively; 1 min each time). To elute the bound phages, PBS with 1% Triton X-100 was added (75 \u00b5L/well) and incubated for 10 min to lyse the cells, followed by mixing with 225 \u00b5L/well of LB broth. Released phages were quantified by a phage plaque assay, amplified, purified, titrated, and used as input for the next round of ex vivo binding selection. After three rounds of selection, enriched phages were selected for ORF clones by binding to streptavidin pre-immobilized on ELISA plates, washed, eluted with PBS containing 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) (75 \u00b5L/well), and mixed with 225 \u00b5L/well of LB broth. After phage amplification in BLT5615, cDNA inserts of the enriched phages were amplified by PCR, purified (400-1500 bp) by agarose gel electrophoresis using Pippin Prep (Sage Science, Beverly, MA, USA), and sequenced by next-generation sequencing. Resulting short reads were assessed for quality using FastQ and aligned to the NCBI CCDS database with BWA. Read counts of identified sequences were compared between DR and healthy cells.",

We utilized a deep mutational scanning (DMS) phage display library containing wildtype and mutant peptides that tile across the gp41 and V3 portions of three Envelope strains (BG505.W6M.C2, BF520.W14M.C2, and C.ZA.1197MB). Peptides in the library are 31 amino acids long and contain every possible single amino acid mutation at the central position, with peptides overlapping by 30 amino acids. Immunoprecipitation was performed in technical duplicate by incubating 10 ng of antibody sample with 1 mL of gp41/V3 Phage-DMS library at a concentration representing 200,000 pfu/mL of each unique clone. Antibody and phage were allowed to form complexes by rocking overnight at 4\u02daC in 96-deepwell plates that had been pre-blocked with 3% BSA in TBST. To isolate phage-antibody complexes, 20 uL each of Protein A and Protein G Dynabeads were added and incubated at 4\u02daC for 4 hr. Beads were magnetically separated, washed 3x with 400 mL wash buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 0.1% [vol/vol] NP-40, pH 7.5), resuspended in 40 mL of dH2O before lysis (95\u02daC for 10 min), and stored at \u00c020\u02daC. PCR and deep sequencing of the enriched phage was done as previously described. Briefly, sequences were amplified to add Illumina barcodes (two rounds) and then pooled and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq with 1 \u00c2 125 bp single-end reads (BioProject accession PRJNA685289). Enrichment and scaled differential selection were calculated as previously described, with analysis performed and plots generated using RStudio (Figure 9-source code 1, Figure 9source datas 1-3). Two biological replicates were run, using the same antibody preps but distinct peptide library preps.",

            "text": "Display technologies is a term that encompasses multiple techniques, such as phage-, ribosome-, and yeast display. They are recombinant screening techniques that afford the screening of large libraries of peptides and proteins to identify binding motifs for a specific target. Examples of such targets can span the length and complexity scales from small molecules to whole cell or tissue surfaces. The phage display approach involves the ectopic expression of peptides or protein fragment libraries on the coat proteins of bacteriophage virions (1,2). Peptide phage display typically involves 2-5 rounds of affinity selection against a given target in a process called \"library panning\". After elution of binding clones from the target they undergo clonal amplification in a suitable bacterial host, before conducting phage DNA extraction and sequencing of the coat protein gene region that includes the randomised recombinant fragment. From this, the peptide sequences that mediate target engagement are deduced. Discovery of binding peptides can provide lead candidates for drug development as exemplified by the approved kallikrein inhibitor drug, ecallantide , which was FDA approved in 2009 for the treatment of hereditary angioedema. In oncology both antibody and peptide phage display has been utilised to discover potential new treatments highlighting the diversity of applications display technologies presents. \n\nSince its invention in the 1980s, peptide phage display technology has developed significantly in terms of both the number of randomised peptides (i.e. library complexity) as well as through increased chemical diversity. Changes in the chemical diversity of randomised native peptides has been achieved in several ways. These include the sitespecific attachment of other chemical species such as reactive glycans to the N-terminus . \n\nComplex cyclic peptide topologies including bi-and tri-cyclic motifs have been achieved either through the chemical reactivity of cysteine with, for example, tris(bromomethyl) benzene to form bicyclic libraries , or directed folding through the inclusion of peptide sequences (e.g. CPPC) that promote the formation of a cystine-knot topology (3). These increases in library complexity and the increased pressure for high-throughput screens against drug targets has demanded faster and more accurate DNA sequencing to ensure the correct candidate sequences are pursued.",

            "text": "Current phage display technologies have been exclusively designed using DNA-based phage platforms such as M13 [1][2][3][4][5]28]. Use of such systems for library screening purposes requires highly diverse starting libraries encoding the displayed proteins since in vitro evolution is difficult, due to the relatively high-fidelity of proof-reading bacterial DNA polymerases. The work of Drake [29] showed a surprisingly consistent overall genomic mutation rate for DNA-based replication in plants, yeast, bacteria and bacteriophage. When the mutation rate per base was multiplied by the genome size, the mutation rate per genome for these DNAbased replicating organisms fell within an astonishingly narrow range (0.0022-0.0046; Table 2). Genomic replication error rates for RNA-based replicating MNV11RNA and bacteriophage Qb were 76and ,5006greater, respectively, revealing a high degree of inherent genomic evolution potential. Compared to M13-based mutation rates, Qb has a 4206 greater mutation rate per base, indicating a major advantage in utilization of Qb for in vitro evolution. Moreover, relatively harsh acidic elution procedures common to DNA phage systems add another obstacle in developing a practical system for in vitro evolution. The RNA phage Qb possesses key features that can be exploited for in vitro evolutionary display that overcomes both obstacles [30]. We describe here a framework for Qb display that allows a robust in vitro evolution at the lab benchtop. \n\nDeveloping Qb phage for peptide display included four steps. Firstly, the DNA sequence coding for the displayed peptides or proteins was fused to the end of the A1 minor coat protein gene in the DNA plasmids utilized. A1 is essential for infection, but specific roles in the Qb virion cycle have not yet been elucidated. Our results indicated that the C-terminus of A1 (nucleotides 2271 to 2333), plays only a minor role in function and is consistent with a previous report describing the importance of the N-terminus [31]. Secondly, recombinant plasmids were sequenced and transformed in bacteria cells to produce a population of phages.",

            "text": "In recent years, NGS technologies have revolutionized both fundamental and translational aspects of biological research. Sequencing of functional antibody repertoires and subsequent bioinformatics analyses has provided unprecedented insights into the mechanisms of B-cell development in humans and other species and has transformed our understanding of immune responses to autoimmunity, vaccination, infection and cancer (34)(35)(36). Sequencing of antibody repertoires is also used for identifying critical biomarkers and epitopes targeted by functional antibody responses for developing vaccines, immunomodulatory drugs and diagnostic tools, and for discovering antibodies (34)(35)(36). NGS technologies have also been employed in several phage display platforms for analyzing natural and synthetic antibody fragment sequences and for identifying and reconstructing scFv and Fab binders not found by conventional ELISA screens (4,37).\n\nIn this work, we developed an NGS-assisted antibody discovery platform. We demonstrated seamless integration of antibody phage display with short-read DNA sequencing using single-framework synthetic Fab libraries rationally engineered to include length and amino acid diversities within CDRs (19,20). Due to limitations in attainable read lengths, NGS of Fab libraries and selection outputs is usually restricted to VH or VL (2,13). Since CDRH3 se- quencing alone is not sufficient for high-throughput reconstruction of Fabs, we developed a method for linking and sequencing all diversified CDRs in phage Fab pools without losing the CDR pairing. Our method determined sequences of paired CDRs in selection outputs and allowed the straightforward conversion of NGS information into Fab clones. Using a defined single-framework, sequencing efforts were directed only toward the diversified CDR regions. NGS primers were designed to anneal the frame-work regions. During sequence analysis, the use of a singleframework eliminated complications associated with the occurrence of multiple frameworks and framework mutations present in natural antibody repertoires enabling fast and accurate interpretation of NGS data sets. The method is rapid and simple and can be adapted to any synthetic scaffoldbased phage library including the HuCal and Ylanthia libraries from MorphoSys (11,(38)(39)(40) by incorporating additional oligonucleotides",

General principles and numerous applications of phage display technology are covered in several books and reviews, for example [12][13][14][15][16]. Here, the focus is on the logic and advances of the landscape phages-multivalent p8-type filamentous-phage constructs, which stand out from traditional phage display systems as a result of their unique structure and emerging properties [17]. Because of these characteristics, landscape phages can be of major interest as a foundation of phage nanobiotechnology-a new area of material science and nanotechnology. Many other filamentous phage vectors, suitable for other types of phage display systems (see below), are presented in [15,18].",

            "text": "To profile TeeVax3 linear epitopes in high throughput, we developed a phage-based peptide display approach to make use of rapid Nanopore sequencing (Fig. 1a). We first cloned short control peptides encoding the 6-His tag and a cyclic peptide mimetic of lipooligosaccharide derived from the pathogen N. gonorrhea (PEP-1) 23 into pAK200 phage display vectors 24 . These peptides were selected as high-affinity antibodies targeting them are readily available. ELISA analysis confirmed control phage binding to both PEP-1 (mAb 2C7 25 ) and anti-His (HIS.H8) monoclonal antibodies above background helper phage binding (Fig. 1b, c). Having demonstrated the suitability of this system for the accessible display of short peptides, we next created a library of peptides from the 940 amino acid TeeVax3 antigen. Bioinformatic tiling was used to generate 308 sequences, each 20 amino acids in length and offset by three amino acids, except for a final tile with a two amino acid offset. To confirm the suitability of nanopore sequencing for tile identification, we further calculated the Levenstein distances between all tiles in the library (Supplementary Fig. S1). We found a minimum edit distance of 16 within the library, corresponding to a required sequencing error rate of 26.3% for misidentification during binning. All tile sequences were back translated, adapter sequences added to the 5' and 3' ends, and the resulting library ordered as an oligo pool (Twist Biosciences). A single cycle of PCR was used to create the second strand of DNA for restriction enzyme cloning into pAK200 and phage production.",

            "text": "This comprehensive review illuminates the unique perspective of phage display, establishing a direct connection between epitope identification and vaccine development to address a specific gap in the field. In Section 3.5, practical examples of epitope identification are presented using two key components, a phage display peptide or genome fragment library and samples from infected, convalescent, or vaccinated individuals. Successful identification of pathogen epitopes has been achieved by using antibodies from these patients. However, there is currently no example where phage display-based epitope identification has been followed by direct utilization of the identified and isolated phage clone as a vaccine. Only one clinical trial has been conducted using M13 vaccine for cancer patients [85]. The purpose of this study has been to highlight an approach that encompasses the entire process from epitope identification to vaccine production using a single technique, without requiring additional manipulation. Unlike conventional methods, phage display demonstrates exceptional efficiency and speed, proving particularly advantageous in critical scenarios such as pandemics. Notably, the timeline from selection to preclinical or clinical trials is significantly compressed, enabling the acquisition of a viable vaccine product within a matter of months instead of years. The review underscores the numerous advantages offered by phage display, encompassing expedited processes such as panning, characterization, sequencing, phage production, and endotoxin removal. By bridging this crucial knowledge gap, the review delivers invaluable insights into the remarkable potential of phage display for swift vaccine development. Undoubtedly, phage-based vaccines have the power to revolutionize the field of vaccinology, boasting immunogenic carrier capabilities, cost-effectiveness, and customization options that position them as a promising alternative to traditional vaccines. While further refinement and validation remain imperative, the advancements in phage display technology hold immense promise for the creation of precise and potent vaccines against infectious diseases.",

The ability to filter non-specific binders and identify high-affinity candidates with greater confidence will expedite efficient peptide drug discovery workflows. Despite these advancements, future work could focus on further optimizing computational efficiency. While the multi-processor implementation already enhances speed, rewriting core components in lower-level programming languages such as C or Rust could further improve performance. \n\nAdditionally, integrating GPU-accelerated processing may enable real-time sequencing analysis, a valuable feature for high-throughput screening applications. Incorporating machine learning techniques to predict high-affinity binders based on sequence motifs could provide another layer of analytical power, enhancing the ability of researchers to prioritize candidate peptides for experimental validation. \n\nIn conclusion, P3ANUT addresses a longstanding need for an efficient, user-friendly, and highly accurate tool for peptide display sequencing analysis. By reducing sequencing errors and offering extensive analytical functionalities, it not only enhances existing methodologies but also opens new possibilities for ligand discovery and biomolecular research. As sequencing technologies continue to evolve, P3ANUT provides a strong foundation for future innovations in high-throughput peptide screening and computational biology.",

Four rounds of panning were done using two targets, the full DENV2 envelope, or the recombinant DIII obtained as described above. For each panning step, several wells in ninety-six-well plates were coated overnight at 4 \u2218 C and then blocked with 400 l of 0.1 M NaHCO 3 (pH 8.6) and 5 mg/ml BSA for 1 h at 4 \u2218 C. After six washes with TBST (TBS, 0.1% Tween 20), 100 l of phages in TBST, containing 10 11 pfu were allowed to bind for 1 h at RT. Then wells were washed ten times with TBST and phages eluted with 0.2 M glycine-HCl pH 2.2, 1 mg/ml BSA. After neutralization with Tris pH 9.1, phages were titered and bulk amplified in E. coli for next round. In order to increase the stringency of the selection, successive rounds were done increasing the concentration of Tween-20 during washes and reducing the amount of target fixed to the solid phase. After the fourth round, eluted phages were plated, picked, and propagated for subsequent phage-ELISA and sequencing.\n\n2.6. Phage-ELISA. DENV2 E, DIII, and BSA were used to coat 96-well microtiter plate (MaxiSorp, Nunc) overnight at 4 \u2218 C.

After washing, HRP-conjugated anti-M13 monoclonal antibody (GE Healthcare, USA) was added, incubated, and washed. Color was developed by adding TMB substrate solution for 10 min and stopped with 1 N HCl. Plates were read at 405 nm.

            "text": "Moreover, with the decreasing cost of gene synthesis services, it is possible to identify, construct, produce, and characterize a higher number of novel antigen-binding candidates more rapidly than would be achievable using a traditional phage-display screening protocol. Our results suggest that those antibodies identified by screening are not necessarily those present in the greatest number in the B cell mRNA, in the cDNA library, or in the organism itself. In this instance our library was of high diversity with only a small minority of high copy number duplications. If those sequences represent B cell lines most amplified by the immune response then it may well be that phage-display screening often fails to identify the most immunologically active antibodies. \n\nOne nagging question that remains, and is common to all techniques involving NGS, is whether the antibodies discovered occur in the animal, or are they artifacts due to PCR or sequencing errors. It is well understood that in mass sequencing of highly diverse genes it will be impossible to distinguish fact from artifact [14]. This can be of great concern for those studying the underlying immune response of animals. In our case, however, the problem is less pressing. When the focus is on the acquisition of functional antibodies for biotechnical application the importance is on affinity and stability, rather than on the reproduction of a native antibody. In any case, the recent development of a new technique for bar-coding of cDNA sequences may be useful in the future for control and analysis of sequencing and PCR artifacts [13]. \n\nThe use of NGS may be of use in cases where despite the researchers' best efforts an antibody library fails to meet expectations. Screening for some targets is problematical, some antibodies recovered have regrettably low affinity, and sometimes discovery of novel antibodies is frustrated when a promising phage-display fusion fails to yield equally high affinity when produced as a free antibody. In these and other cases it will be useful to conduct NGS in order to examine the plurality of related antibodies.",

            "text": "Due to the growing popularity of phage display for peptide discovery, commercial phage display libraries have gained considerable attention for the discovery of translational peptides. Since M13KE-based Ph.D. libraries are extensively used in phage display research, identifying the origin of white plaques observed upon working with these libraries is crucial. Our findings provide clear evidence for the fact that white clones might derive from the library, and not every white plaque should be viewed as environmental contamination. In the case of endogenous origin of white clones, all manufacturer's recommendations to remove these plaques from biopanned phage pools, such as sterilization of equipment and reagents, are not helpful. Upon finding white plaques during library selection, we highly recommend determining their genetic identity. This genotypic characterization can be easily conducted by picking out a number of white plaques and sequencing them. Sequencing can be performed by using (\u221296 gIII and \u221228 gIII primers) provided in the Ph.D. TM -7 library kit or any type of custom-made primers, which target genomic regions able to show nucleotide differences between environment-derived WT-M13 and libraryderived M13KE. Since mutations giving rise to propagation advantage may prevent the enrichment of true target binding clones, this work highly emphasizes the importance of identifying and genetically characterizing these mutants to avoid their misidentification as target-specific binders.",

            "text": "Generation and isolation of antigen-specific lampribodies using phage display technology has been clearly demonstrated in the above experiments using lysozyme and human IgM as immunogens. The screening in phage display libraries relies on competitive binding and selection of the monomeric lampribody fused to the pIII molecule of the recombinant phage in each panning step. This allows for isolation of high affinity binders and their clonal expansion. By contrast, the screening method for isolating the binders in eukaryotic cells and yeast surface display does not allow competitive binding. Amplification of the relative high affinity binders in the panning rounds was observed in the case of both anti-lysozyme and anti-human IgM phage display screening. This was most likely due to the stringent screening conditions employed to eliminate selection of false positive clones.\n\nBy varying the stringency, the system should allow isolation of polyclonal lampribodies against an immunogen. It would also be interesting to map the epitopes in case of polyclonal responses. In a preliminary experiment, phages containing VLRB.HEL1, VLRB.HEL21, and VLRB.HEL2D molecules were mixed together with a n\u00e4ive VLRB phage display library at a ratio of 1 to one million. After the first round of panning under less stringent conditions, all three VLRB.HEL phages were recovered, emulating a polyclonal response. In the extreme dilution experiment described above, we used the same strategy to make serial dilutions of one of these (VLRB.HEL21) at a ratio of 1 to one billion and we were still able to faithfully recover the clone after only 3 rounds of selection. These results conclusively show that the VLRB sequences identified by another method (yeast surface display) can readily be selected when cloned in a phage display system.\n\nHere, we have shown that the phage display system can be adopted to the variable lymphocyte receptors of the sea lamprey. The advantage of working with such a prokaryotic system is the ease at which the antibody repertoire can be cloned and screened. The reagents used for constructing and screening the library are off",

            "text": "Phage display is a powerful in vitro selection technique, which enables the identification of high-affinity peptides or antibodies from libraries of phage particles displaying highly diverse peptides [1]. Libraries with a great variety of peptides are subject to one or more rounds of affinity selection, also called biopanning, which contains repetitive rounds of target-binding (selection) and proliferation [2]. The rapid isolation of ligands for a distinct target by biopanning has a wide range of applications extending from epitope determination [2,3], protein-protein interaction detection [4], to new vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics development [5][6][7]. \n\nAdditionally, the selection from phage-displayed libraries has been increasingly employed in the design of new chemicals [8] and the development of new materials [9]. \n\nIn recent years, next-generation sequencing (NGS) has substantially contributed to the analysis of phage-displayed screens [10][11][12][13][14][15]. In sharp contrast with traditional phage display, phage display selections powered by NGS can produce enormous data output and facilitate the finding of specific binders by avoiding iterative selections and restraining the number of false positive hits [11]. However, both classical phage display and next-generation phage display (NGPD) screens are deeply troubled by the emergence of target-unrelated peptides (TUPs). Derda et al. described and confirmed that selection from phage display libraries is driven by two independent pressures [10,16]: (1) the selection-related pressure which enriches for clones that bind to the desired target or non-target-related components (e.g., protein A/G, bead) of the biopanning system during the selection step [17]; (2) The proliferation-related pressure which enriches clones exhibiting faster proliferation abilities during the amplification step [18][19][20]. Hence, biopanning output is actually a mixture of true binders and TUPs.",

The chosen platform based on the magnetic particle manipulation is highly flexible and allows the selection of ligands for a multitude of downstream applications. The selection technology should be chosen carefully, because the resulting binders may prove to perform differently in the desired final application. The semi-automation has reached a considerable maturity for phage display and is now employed on a regular basis. For SELEX, we are currently evaluating the use of emulsions in the amplification steps to reduce bias and parasitic artefacts. Additionally, the use of next generation sequencing platforms circumvents the classical cloning and can reduce the amount of selection steps for the identification of binders. We expect that the current gap in the overall performance of phage display and SELEX can be reduced with the introduction of these new developments along with the presented approach to semi-automation.",

            "text": "Next generation sequencing technologies have undeniably changed the scientific landscape in biology. The fast-paced methodological progress driving many of the developments in the field has not only been the result of exceptional advances in sequencing chemistry, detection systems and data-processing or analysis methods (1), but also of innovations in the area of sequencing library construction. The paramount role of library construction is often underappreciated, yet it shapes both outcome and inference: the library protocol should meticulously capture the specific molecules of interest, yet minimize unwanted fragments or biases in order to ensure accurate interpretation ('garbage in is garbage out'). Additionally, a higher quality library usually maximizes the useful sequencing read output and facilitates data processing. Indeed, in the past few years, the num-ber of studies reporting (and in many, cases, addressing) the impact of the choice of specific enzymes, reagents, reaction conditions or overall protocols on the resulting library quality have grown exponentially, and there is renewed interest in the development of molecular biology tools designed to overcome these biases. \n\nIn addition to libraries for sequencing purposes, many proteome-wide functional assays, for instance assessing protein interactions (2,3), protein localization (4), posttranscriptional regulation (5) or drug activity (6), also rely on pooled or arrayed nucleic acid libraries as input. Fortunately, some of these libraries can now be accurately synthesized at relatively low cost, or one can rely on available collections of full-length and validated open reading frames (ORFs) on plasmids (7), short hairpin or small interfering RNA libraries (8) and guide RNA libraries for CRISPR screens (9). In several other cases, however, such as for very large libraries or libraries with custom requirements, highquality libraries still need to be generated. Coding sequence fragment libraries are a prominent example (10)(11)(12)(13). \n\nMany researchers can (and do) resort to the use of commercial kits to capture the desired nucleic acid species into a workable library of molecules. While there are numerous suppliers for sequencing library construction, and the resulting libraries are often of reasonable quality for standard sequencing experiments (e.g.",

            "text": "Antibody display libraries derived from human PBMCs or hybridomas immortalized from B cell populations have been successfully used in recent decades to isolate binders against a wide range of targets, despite a lack of detailed knowledge of the repertoires (34,35). With the advent of NGS, analysis of the natural na\u00efve repertoires from which libraries have been constructed has become possible. \n\nIn an early paper, the diversity of a phage displayed combinatorial library generated from the IgM repertoire of 654 healthy human donors was precisely quantified by deep sequencing preand post-selection using long-read pyrosequencing (12). Variable domain PCR amplicon and rolling circle amplified shotgun methods allowed an efficient assessment of diversity, as well as the correct assignment of heavy and light chain pairing. A novel application of Hidden Markov Model (HMM) accurately identified CDR regions. The sequencing results revealed that all germline families were present and a high degree of somatic mutations in CDR1 and CDR2 provided additional complexity to a library that was estimated to be similar in diversity to the number of transformants (3.5 \u00d7 10 10 ). The library was subjected to panning against 16 targets and pairing preferences were observed for heavy and light chains. This information was used to produce combinatorial libraries that mimic the natural repertoire both in length and sequence diversity. A synthetic Fab library was fabricated in which all six CDRs are diversified by synthetic enzymatic codon addition method allowing precise control of amino acid additions at each position in the CDRs, to recapitulate those found in nature. The library was subjected to panning against a diverse panel of receptors, growth factors, antigens, enzymes, and peptides. Binders were isolated for all antigens with nanomolar affinities measured for 6 out of 10 antigens (36). \n\nLarman et al. (37) describe an interesting synthetic approach where CDR sequences were designed using a HMM model of \"contact\" and\"non-contact\" states for amino acid positions based upon known antibody-antigen complexes.",

            "text": "After establishing that the epiotope display library contained antibody-binding mimitopes, we pursued a cDNA phage library approach. A cDNA phage display library was constructed from the SKBR3 breast cancer cell line. The parental cDNA library was oligo-dT primed (i.e. contains a 3k stop codon), and thus required 3k modification to prevent a stop codon within the pIII-fusion. The phage library contained 3r10 7 clones with insert size ranging between 200-1000 bp, corresponding to domainsized fragments (Figure 4). Preliminary library characterization using the myc epitope tag indicated functional display of >10 6 clones (11/95 randomly selected clones were ELISA positive). DNA sequencing of random clones from the unselected library revealed only human sequences (400 bp fragment corresponding to human S19 ribosomal protein; 250 bp human ribosomal protein RPL13/S11, U32-UU35; 350 bp homology to drosophila BcDNA GM013838; 240 bp human BAC G1-214N3; 500 bp human 80 kd heat shock protein; 650 bp human KIAA0466 protein). Bacterial sequences were not detected in the SKBR3 display library. Phage epitopes were selected using the Herceptin 1 monoclonal antibody, which binds c-erbB2, a cell surface receptor over-expressed in the SKBR3 cell line. Enrichment of antibody binders occurred after two selection rounds: the titers of recovered phage increased between round 1 (10 5 cfu) and round 2 (10 6 cfu). After two selection rounds, 6/95 phage clones bound Herceptin by ELISA. Enrichment decreased with a third round of selection, despite repeated selections (Round 3, 10 5 cfu). Six clones from Round 2 were sequenced; however, none matched a sequence corresponding to human c-erbB2 (Table 2). Rather, the clones contained human sequences that matched enzymes, signaling molecules, and structural proteins ( Table 2).",

            "text": "Perspective have been successfully applied to screen antibody libraries. Although less popular than phage display technology, these methods present some advantages, such as the ability of yeast cells to express complex proteins that require post-translational modifications or the possibility to create larger libraries using cell-free methods that are not restricted by the bacterial transformation efficiency. 64 he process of in vitro affinity selection, whether it is based on phage or other display systems, commonly includes (I) the generation of genotypic diversity by constructing protein or peptide libraries that consist of millions or billions of different variants; (II) the display method that creates a physical link between the expressed protein variant and the gene coding for it; (III) the application of selective pressure to screen for target-specific binders, and, finally, (IV) the amplification of the selected variants. 9 \u221267 These systems provide immediately the genes and corresponding DNA sequences of the clones selected against the specific target. Simple subcloning can allow presenting modifications or adding functionalities, such as purification tags or fusions to enzymes or fluorescent proteins. 65 Moreover, also conventionally challenging targets, such as toxic or nonimmunogenic molecules, have been successfully used. 68,69 he screening process of phage-displayed libraries, commonly known as panning, includes introducing the phagedisplayed library to the target captured to a solid surface, washing to remove the unbound and nonspecifically bound phages, elution of the bound phages, and amplification of the eluted phages through bacterial infection (Figure 2A). Ideally, only one round of selection is required, but as nonspecific binding limits the enrichment in one selection round, in most cases, three to five iterative rounds of selection and amplification are performed to select individual binders. \n\nA variety of modifications in the panning protocol and details for improved selections have been described for the identification of high-affinity binders from phage-displayed libraries. Generally, the experiment can be designed to maximize either phage capture or affinity discrimination. While effective capture is best used for the first selection round, the conditions can be modified in the later rounds to produce better affinity discrimination. 5",

            "text": "The discovery of molecular probes or tools, including inhibitors, activators or simply binders of biologically relevant entities is highly valuable and enables the probing of biological networks. Efforts in this area have been greatly accelerated by the application of phage display technology [1][2][3][4][5][6], a high throughput technique commonly used to find peptidic interactors. Binders and modulators of proteins, protein-protein, and protein-peptide interactions are identified from screening bacteriophages which express a genetically encoded combinatorial peptide library on their surface. Bacteriophages provide a physical link between the encoding DNA and the expressed ligand. The randomized peptide sequence may be of various lengths, allowing biological and chemical exploration of peptides (cyclic and linear) [7][8][9][10], antibodies [11][12][13][14][15][16], and biosimilars [17][18][19][20]. High-complexity phage libraries are screened against target proteins in an affinity selection process called biopanning. Biopanning involves incubating the phage display libraries with immobilized target proteins, followed by extensive stringent washing to remove weak-binding and non-bound phages. The remaining bound phages are typically eluted with glycine-HCL and reamplified by infecting host cells. The whole process is typically repeated three to five times to enrich phages with high binding affinity [21,22]. After biopanning, DNA sequencing allows determination of primary sequence of the binder which can then be synthesized or expressed for use in basic and translational research. \n\nThe complexity of a phage display library containing a randomized peptide sequence of a certain length can be defined as the maximum number of unique sequences possible within that library. In a simple 5-mer peptide library made up of the 20 natural amino acids, the complexity is 3.2 million (20 5 ) unique sequences. This complexity rapidly increases with increased randomized positions, requiring 1.024x10 13 unique sequences to fully cover a 10-mer library. Currently, literature routinely reports on libraries of up to 10 10 unique sequences [4].",

            "text": "When using invitro display, one of the concerns is that the total diversity of antibodies found in these libraries may not be fully tapped during selections. Theoretical 5 and experimental 6,7 assessments indicate that one would expect to recover thousands of different antibodies from a10 8 diversity library, and yet, unless heroic efforts are made, 8 the number of antibodies identified is usually less than 50. This is mainly due to two factors:1) many antibody libraries are not as diverse as indicated by the number of transformants, 9,10 and2) the way potential binders are traditionally screened identifies leads after extensive individual clone screening, an inefficient approach vexed by the redundancy of abundant clones, and sparse, or absent, representation of most clones that occur in lower frequencies within the selected population. Moreover, clones with high binding activity, or with other prominent functional properties, can be found within the lower frequency clone population. Their rarity can be explained by lower expression levels in aprokaryotic system, or by more general biases resulting from the biopanning process. 11 An alternative approach is to use next-generation sequencing (NGS), which has massively increased the capacity to sequence millions of clones in avery fast and inexpensive way, 12 revolutionizing several aspects of biological research, including invitro and invivo antibody selections. 10,13 e routinely use an approach that exploits NGS in invitro display selection analyses. By combining phage display, yeast display, and NGS, we have shown that the number of identified antibodies can exceed 1,000, 10,14,15 reflecting the far deeper sampling that NGS provides: millions of reads, rather than hundreds of microtiter plate wells screened. This is particularly true if there is bias in the selected population, which is often the case. However, unless antibodies identified by NGS can be easily produced as clones for further analysis, their specificities and properties cannot be assessed, leaving uncertain the true breadth of available reactivities, and risking the loss of many potentially valuable antibodies. The greater the number of different antibodies available, the greater the number of different epitopes, and consequently biological activities, that can be targeted. The caveat of NGS sequencing is that after identifying the desired sequences, one does not have the isolated clones in hand.",

            "text": "High-throughput sequencing (HTS) was successfully applied to phage display technology, to get full advantage from screening of phage display libraries [18,19]. It allows us to rapidly identify the potential binders of a given antigen, based on the counts of the corresponding scFv fragments, within a cycle, and on the kinetic of their enrichments, within consecutive cycles; that may provide useful information on the whole screening. After their identification, the clones of interest need to be recovered from the DNA library of the relevant selection cycle, for validation of binding. HTSbased selection of phage display libraries should provide rapid information on the screening progression and a comprehensive set of scFv clones, since it limits the possibility to loose potential good binders during the repetitive handling of clones, which is required during a classical screening. The bottleneck of a HTS-based screening is, however, the recovery of scFv clones of interest. The availability of a set of alternative strategies, to recover rapidly the clones of interest, would allow us to overcome the limiting step in HTS-based screening of phage display libraries [19]. In this paper, we tested the whole procedure of a HTS-based screening, to isolate binders of native CLDN1 protein, expressed on the cell surface of mammalian cells. We successfully identified a set of 75 potential binders of CLDN1, from which novel, human antibodies could be isolated, possessing the ability to interfere with HCV infection. We also implemented a rapid and effective method, for one-step recovery of scFv clones from the enriched population of fragments. This method was applied to some scFv fragments, characterized by heavychain complementarity determining regions 3 (HCDR3) of different length, to demonstrate its effectiveness in the generation of complete and functional monoclonal antibodies.",

            "text": "The identification of therapeutic peptides from unmodified phage-displayed libraries is hindered because linear peptides have poor pharmacokinetic properties. The introduction of ncAAs and motifs allows for a more simplistic transition of peptide lead compounds into therapeutics, as they can increase the stability and improve binding toward a desired target. In the past two decades, noncanonical peptides have been produced on phage-displayed libraries through two segregated techniques: genetic code expansion and chemical transformations. Both techniques have afforded highly diverse phage-displayed libraries, ranging from linear libraries containing noncanonical moieties for enhanced phage selections to display of cyclic peptide libraries for enhanced pharmacokinetics. To further diversify phage libraries, it may be worthwhile to combine the two fields. For example, introduction of ncAAs through genetic code expansion can give highly specific reactive handles to selectively label phage libraries and to produce specific cyclic peptide motifs that avoid the ambiguity of labeling natural residues with chemical reagents. This would afford highly diverse libraries that are selectively modified, increasing efficiencies of selections and peptide characterization. While integration of genetic code expansion with chemically modified phage libraries would result in diverse scaffolds for phage-displayed peptides, there are still limitations to consider with phage display. The first of these involves the limitation regarding initial transformation efficiency\ufffdplasmids must be transformed into cells, which usually limits the displayed libraries to 10 10 peptides. There has been a recent case that generated a library of 10 11 peptides by transformation of diverse peptide scaffolds, but this would be the upper limit for most laboratories. 189 One way that may get around this limitation would be the integration of phage-displayed peptides into in vivo evolution systems, such as phage-assisted continuous evolution, that simultaneously mutate and select for peptides with desired activities. 190 This would provide essentially unlimited peptides available for screening, as higher diversities are generated as the evolution continues. Additionally, genetic code expansion in phage display is limited to only orthogonal translation systems, as the endogenous translation is necessary for producing all the phage proteins. Because of this, incorporation of ncAAs at sense codons is difficult due to competition with the natural amino acids.",

            "text": "BackgroundAntibody phage display is a proven key technology that allows the generation of human antibodies for diagnostics and therapy. From naive antibody gene libraries - in theory - antibodies against any target can be selected. Here we describe the design, construction and characterization of an optimized antibody phage display library.ResultsThe naive antibody gene libraries HAL9 and HAL10, with a combined theoretical diversity of 1.5\u00d71010 independent clones, were constructed from 98 healthy donors using improved phage display vectors. In detail, most common phagemids employed for antibody phage display are using a combined His/Myc tag for detection and purification. We show that changing the tag order to Myc/His improved the production of soluble antibodies, but did not affect antibody phage display. For several published antibody libraries, the selected number of kappa scFvs were lower compared to lambda scFvs, probably due to a lower kappa scFv or Fab expression rate. Deletion of a phenylalanine at the end of the CL linker sequence in our new phagemid design increased scFv production rate and frequency of selected kappa antibodies significantly. The HAL libraries and 834 antibodies selected against 121 targets were analyzed regarding the used germline V-genes, used V-gene combinations and CDR-H3/-L3 length and composition. The amino acid diversity and distribution in the CDR-H3 of the initial library was retrieved in the CDR-H3 of selected antibodies showing that all CDR-H3 amino acids occurring in the human antibody repertoire can be functionally used and is not biased by E. coli expression or phage selection. Further, the data underline the importance of CDR length variations.ConclusionThe highly diverse universal antibody gene libraries HAL9/10 were constructed using an optimized scFv phagemid vector design. Analysis of selected antibodies revealed that the complete amino acid diversity in the CDR-H3 was also found in selected scFvs showing the functionality of the naive CDR-H3 diversity.",

Analysis of the selected DNA pools of by next-generation sequencing and in-house bioinformatics methods revealed a detailed transglutaminase 1 substrate profile indicating preferred and non-preferred amino acid sequences.

Relatively few biologics have been developed for FAP and none have been developed that exploit the unique engagement properties of Variable New Antigen Receptors (VNARs) from shark antibodies. As the smallest binding domain in nature, VNARs cleverage unique geometries and recognize epitopes conventional antibodies cannot. By directly immunizing a nurse shark with FAP, we created a large anti-FAP VNAR phage display library. This library allowed us to identify a suite of anti-FAP VNARs through traditional biopanning and also by an in silico approach that did not require any prior affinity-based enrichment in vitro. We investigated four VNAR-Fc fusion proteins for theranostic properties and found that all four recognized FAP with high affinity and were rapidly internalized by FAP-positive cells. As a result, the VNAR-Fc constructs were effective antibody-drug conjugates in vitro and were able to localize to FAP-positive xenografts in vivo. Our findings establish VNAR-Fc constructs as a versatile platform for theranostic development that could yield innovative cancer therapies targeting the TME.",

In this study, we targeted the follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR), a significant regulator of reproduction, with variable domains of heavy chain-only antibodies (VHHs). We built two immune VHH libraries and submitted them to multiplexed phage display approaches. We used next-generation sequencing to identify 34 clusters of specifically enriched sequences that were functionally assessed in a primary screen based on a cAMP response element (CRE)-dependent reporter gene assay. In this assay, 23 VHHs displayed negative or positive modulation of FSH-induced responses, suggesting a high success rate of the multiplexed strategy. We then focused on the largest cluster identified (i.e., PRC1) that displayed positive modulation of FSH action. We demonstrated that PRC1 specifically binds to the human FSHR and human FSHR/FSH complex while potentiating FSH-induced cAMP production and Gs recruitment. We conclude that the improved selection strategy reported here is effective for rapidly identifying functionally active VHHs and could be adapted to target other challenging membrane receptors. This study also led to the identification of PRC1, the first potential positive modulator VHH reported for the human FSHR.",

In this study, a large human combinatorial single-chain variable fragment library (1.5 \u00d7 1011 colonies) was constructed from Epstein\u2013Barr virus-infected human peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with a combination of two of the activators of human B cells, the Toll-like receptor 7/8 agonist R848 and interleukin-2. Next-generation sequencing analysis with approximately 1.9 \u00d7 106 and 2.7 \u00d7 106 full-length sequences of heavy chain variable (VH) and \u03ba light chain variable (V\u03ba) domains, respectively, revealed that the library consists of unique VH (approximately 94%) and V\u03ba (approximately 91%) sequences with greater diversity than germline sequences. Lastly, multiple unique mAbs with high affinity and broad cross-species reactivity could be isolated from the library against two therapeutically relevant target antigens, validating the library quality.

Herein we developed a procedure to efficiently compare the sequences of large numbers of phage-selected peptides for the purpose of identifying target-binding peptide motifs. We applied the procedure to analyze bicyclic peptides isolated against five different protein targets: sortase A, urokinase-type plasminogen activator, coagulation factor XII, plasma kallikrein and streptavidin. We optimized sequence data filters to reduce biases originating from the sequencing method and developed sequence correction algorithms to prevent identification of false consensus motifs. With our strategy, we were able to identify rare target-binding peptide motifs, as well as to define more precisely consensus sequences and sub-groups of consensus sequences. This information is valuable to choose peptide leads for drug development and it facilitates identification of epitopes. We furthermore show that binding motifs can be identified after a single round of phage selection. Such a selection regimen reduces propagation-related bias and may facilitate application of phage display in non-specialized laboratories, as procedures such as bacterial infection, phage propagation and purification are not required.",

In this study, phages were selected based on their interaction with patient serum and exhaustively characterised by high-throughput sequencing. A bioinformatics approach was developed in order to identify peptide motifs of interest based on clustering and contrasting to control samples. Comparison of patient and control samples confirmed a major issue in phage display, namely the selection of unspecific peptides. The potential of the bioinformatic approach was demonstrated by identifying epitopes of a prominent peanut allergen, Ara h 1, in sera from patients with severe peanut allergy. The identified epitopes were confirmed by high-density peptide micro-arrays. The present study demonstrates that high-throughput sequencing can empower phage display by (i) enabling the analysis of complex biological samples, (ii) circumventing the traditional laborious picking and functional testing of individual phage clones and (iii) reducing the number of selection rounds.",

In this report, we use next-generation sequencing to analyze phage-displayed libraries and uncover a strong bias induced by amplification preferences of phage in bacteria. This bias favors fast-growing sequences that collectively constitute <0.01% of the available diversity. Specifically, a library of 109 random 7-mer peptides (Ph.D.-7) includes a few thousand sequences that grow quickly (the \u2018parasites\u2019), which are the sequences that are typically identified in phage display screens published to date. A similar collapse was observed in other libraries. Using Illumina and Ion Torrent sequencing and multiple biological replicates of amplification of Ph.D.-7 library, we identified a focused population of 770 \u2018parasites\u2019. In all, 197 sequences from this population have been identified in literature reports that used Ph.D.-7 library. Many of these enriched sequences have confirmed function (e.g. target binding capacity). The bias in the literature, thus, can be viewed as a selection with two different selection pressures: (i) target-binding selection, and (ii) amplification-induced selection. Enrichment of parasitic sequences could be minimized if amplification bias is removed. Here, we demonstrate that emulsion amplification in libraries of \u223c106 diverse clones prevents the biased selection of parasitic clones.",

However, it is possible that the surface of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), also possesses molecules which might be non-antigenic. This makes the probing of biomarkers on the surface of M. tb cell wall difficult using antibodies. Here we demonstrate the use of phage display technology to identify peptides that bind to mycobacteria. We identified these clones using both random clone picking and high throughput sequencing. We demonstrate that random clone picking does not necessarily identify highly enriched clones. We further showed that the clone displaying the CPLHARLPC peptide which was identified by Illumina sequencing as the most enriched, binds better to mycobacteria than three clones selected by random picking. Using surface plasmon resonance, we showed that chemically synthesised CPLHARLPC peptide binds to a 15 KDa peptide from M.tb H37Rv whole cell lysates. These observations demonstrate that phage display technology combined with high-throughput sequencing is a powerful tool to identify peptides that can be used for investigating potential non-antigenic biomarkers for TB and other bacterial infections.",

After sequencing in vitro selected populations, clones are binned into identical or similar groups and ordered by abundance, allowing identification of those that are most enriched. However, the greatest strength of deep sequencing is also its greatest weakness: clones are easily identified by their DNA sequences, but are not physically available for testing without a laborious multistep process involving several rounds of polymerization chain reaction (PCR), assembly and cloning. Here, using the isolation of antibody genes from a phage and yeast display selection as an example, we show the power of a rapid and simple inverse PCR-based method to easily isolate clones identified by deep sequencing. Once primers have been received, clone isolation can be carried out in a single day, rather than two days. Furthermore the reduced number of PCRs required will reduce PCR mutations correspondingly. We have observed a 100% success rate in amplifying clones with an abundance as low as 0.5% in a polyclonal population. This approach allows us to obtain full-length clones even when an incomplete sequence is available, and greatly simplifies the subcloning process. Moreover, rarer, but functional clones missed by traditional screening can be easily isolated using this method, and the approach can be extended to any selected library (scFv, cDNA, libraries based on scaffold proteins) where a unique sequence signature for the desired clones of interest is available."

Approximately 30% of the approved antibodies for clinical treatments in the last 5 years were isolated from phage-displayed libraries using different selection strategies. (Grilo et al., 2019) Originally, the validation of selected clones was based on either the enrichment of specific clones throughout the selection rounds (Griffiths et al., 1994) or biological activities of some (few) randomly selected clones. 3 However, the low throughput of Sanger sequencing limited these strategies, as enriched clones were assessed from few sequences, or activityscreened clones (antigen binding, for example). Thirty years after the pioneering work describing the phase-display technique, (Smith, 1985) new methodologies such as next-generation sequencing (NGS) have pushed the technology toward modern standards for selecting biologically active selected clones. \n\nThe development of NGS increased in several orders of magnitude the quantity of individual clone sequences obtained, allowing the determination of complete variable domain repertoires.

From the emergence of the pre-B-cell receptor, signal transduction stimulates and supports B-cell development. Current viewpoints indicate that both positive selection pressure for autoantigens and tonic signaling constitutively stimulate B-cell maturation. In this work, we tested for the presence of a putative DNA binding site in a variable gene segment in a germline configuration, independently of VDJ recombination. After a survey of the public antibody databases, we chose a single mouse heavy variable gene segment that is highly represented in anti-nucleic acid antibodies and tested it for ssDNA binding. A phage display approach was used to search for intrinsic binding to oligo deoxythymidine. The results revealed that binding to an antigen can be influenced by the use of a specific DNA binding V gene segment. Our data support the idea that some variable genes have intrinsic reactivity towards specific types of endogenous autoantigens, and this property may contribute to the establishment of the immature B-cell repertoire.",

Individually cloned heavy and light chain variable region libraries were combined in an efficient two-step cloning procedure, permitting the cloning of a total of 3.7 \u00d7 1010 independent Fab clones. The performance of the library was determined by the successful selection of on average 14 different Fabs against 6 antigens tested. These include tetanus toxoid, the hapten phenyl-oxazolone, the breast cancer-associated MUC1 antigen, and three highly related glycoprotein hormones: human chorionic gonadotropin, human luteinizing hormone, and human follicle-stimulating hormone. In the latter category, a panel of either homone-specific or cross-reactive antibodies were identified. The design of the library permits the monitoring of selections with polyclonal phage preparations and to carry out large scale screening of antibody off-rates with unpurified Fab fragments on BIAcore. Antibodies with off-rates in the order of 10\u22122 to 10\u22124s\u22121 and affinities up to 2.7 nm were recovered. The kinetics of these phage antibodies are of the same order of magnitude as antibodies associated with a secondary immune response. This new phage antibody library is set to become a valuable source of antibodies to many different targets, and to play a vital role in target discovery and validation in the area of functional genomics.",

The power of this method lies in its ability to efficiently and rapidly identify ligands with a desired target property from a large population of phage clones displaying diverse surface peptides. However, the search for the needle in the haystack does not always end successfully. False positive results may appear. Thus instead of specific binders phage with no actual affinity toward the target are recovered due to their propagation advantages or binding to other components of the screening system, such as the solid phase, capturing reagents, contaminants in the target sample or blocking agents, rather than the target. Biopanning experiments on different targets performed in our laboratory revealed some previously identified and many new target-unrelated peptide sequences, which have already been frequently described and published, but not yet recognized as target-unrelated. Distinguishing true binders from false positives is an important step toward phage display selections of greater integrity. This article thoroughly reviews and discusses already identified and new target-unrelated peptides and suggests strategies to avoid their isolation.",

Drug candidates are typically isolated in two steps: First, a pool of antibodies is enriched through consecutive rounds of selection on a target antigen, and then individual clones are characterized in a screening procedure. When whole cells are used as targets, as in phenotypic discovery, the output phage pool typically contains thousands of antibodies, binding, in theory, hundreds of different cell surface receptors. Clonal expansion throughout the phage display enrichment process is affected by multiple factors resulting in extremely complex output phage pools where a few antibodies are highly abundant and the majority is very rare. This is a huge challenge in the screening where only a fraction of the antibodies can be tested using a conventional binding analysis, identifying mainly the most abundant clones typically binding only one or a few targets. As the expected number of antibodies and specificities in the pool is much higher, complementing methods, to reach deeper into the pool, are required, called deep mining methods. In this study, four deep mining methods were evaluated: 1) isolation of rare sub-pools of specific antibodies through selection on recombinant proteins predicted to be expressed on the target cells, 2) isolation of a sub-pool enriched for antibodies of unknown specificities through depletion of the primary phage pool on recombinant proteins corresponding to receptors known to generate many binders, 3) isolation of a sub-pool enriched for antibodies through selection on cells blocked with antibodies dominating the primary phage pool, and 4) next-generation sequencing-based analysis of isolated antibody pools followed by antibody gene synthesis and production of rare but enriched clones. We demonstrate that antibodies binding new targets and epitopes, not discovered through screening alone, can be discovered using described deep mining methods. Overall, we demonstrate the complexity of phage pools generated through selection on cells and show that a combination of conventional screening and deep mining methods are needed to fully utilize such pools. Deep mining will be important in future phenotypic antibody drug discovery efforts to increase the diversity of identified antibodies and targets.",

Even so, this does not seem to limit their specificity and high affinity as HcAbs against a broad range of structurally diverse antigens have been reported. The recombinant form of their variable domain [nanobody (Nb)] has outstanding properties that make Nbs, not just an alternative option to conventional antibodies, but in many cases, these properties allow them to reach analytical or diagnostic performances that cannot be accomplished with conventional antibodies. These attributes include comprehensive representation of the immune specificity in display libraries, easy adaptation to high-throughput screening, exceptional stability, minimal size, and versatility as affinity building block. Here, we critically reviewed each of these properties and highlight their relevance with regard to recent developments in different fields of immunosensing applications."

Random peptide sequences expressed on the phage surface can interact with the target of interest and phages expressing peptides that bind specifically to the target can be isolated. Phage display screening, called biopanning, consists of iterative rounds in which the library is presented to the target of interest, and the selected phage pool is amplified by infection of Escherichia coli cells. The amplified phages serve as input for the subsequent round of biopanning (Smith, 2019). Traditionally, biopanning outputs have been analyzed by Sanger sequencing. This sequencing approach can identify only a limited number of peptides in the library. Recent advances have combined phage display with next-generation sequencing (NGS), allowing for the sequencing of thousands to millions of peptide inserts in parallel (Dias-Neto et al., 2009)(Hoen et al., 2012)(Matochko et al., 2012).

Rate-limiting steps of combinatorial phage display library selection are (i) the counting of transducing units and (ii) the sequencing of the encoded displayed ligands. Here, we adapted emerging genomic technologies to minimize such challenges. Methodology/Principal Findings We gained efficiency by applying in tandem real-time PCR for rapid quantification to enable bacteria-free phage display library screening, and added phage DNA next-generation sequencing for large-scale ligand analysis, reporting a fully integrated set of high-throughput quantitative and analytical tools. The approach is far less labor-intensive and allows rigorous quantification; for medical applications, including selections in patients, it also represents an advance for quantitative distribution analysis and ligand identification of hundreds of thousands of targeted particles from patient-derived biopsy or autopsy in a longer timeframe post library administration. Additional advantages over current methods include increased sensitivity, less variability, enhanced linearity, scalability, and accuracy at much lower cost. Sequences obtained by qPhage plus pyrosequencing were similar to a dataset produced from conventional Sanger-sequenced transducing-units (TU), with no biases due to GC content, codon usage, and amino acid or peptide frequency. These tools allow phage display selection and ligand analysis at >1,000-fold faster rate, and reduce costs \u223c250-fold for generating 106 ligand sequences. Conclusions/Significance Our analyses demonstrates that whereas this approach correlates with the traditional colony-counting, it is also capable of a much larger sampling, allowing a faster, less expensive, more accurate and consistent analysis of phage enrichment. Overall, qPhage plus pyrosequencing is superior to TU-counting plus Sanger sequencing and is proposed as the method of choice over a broad range of phage display applications in vitro, in cells, and in vivo.",

In this work, we developed an NGS-assisted antibody discovery platform by integrating phage-displayed, single-framework, synthetic Fab libraries. Due to limitations in attainable read and amplicon lengths, NGS analysis of Fab libraries and selection outputs is usually restricted to either VH or VL. Since this information alone is not sufficient for high-throughput reconstruction of Fabs, we developed a rapid and simple method for linking and sequencing all diversified CDRs in phage Fab pools. Our method resulted in a reliable and straightforward platform for converting NGS information into Fab clones. We used our NGS-assisted Fab reconstruction method to recover low-frequency rare clones from phage selection outputs. While previous studies chose rare clones for rescue based on their relative frequencies in sequencing outputs, we chose rare clones for reconstruction from less-frequent CDRH3 lengths.

After sequencing in vitro selected populations, clones are binned into identical or similar groups and ordered by abundance, allowing identification of those that are most enriched. However, the greatest strength of deep sequencing is also its greatest weakness: clones are easily identified by their DNA sequences, but are not physically available for testing without a laborious multistep process involving several rounds of polymerization chain reaction (PCR), assembly and cloning. Here, using the isolation of antibody genes from a phage and yeast display selection as an example, we show the power of a rapid and simple inverse PCR-based method to easily isolate clones identified by deep sequencing. Once primers have been received, clone isolation can be carried out in a single day, rather than two days. Furthermore the reduced number of PCRs required will reduce PCR mutations correspondingly. We have observed a 100% success rate in amplifying clones with an abundance as low as 0.5% in a polyclonal population. This approach allows us to obtain full-length clones even when an incomplete sequence is available, and greatly simplifies the subcloning process. Moreover, rarer, but functional clones missed by traditional screening can be easily isolated using this method, and the approach can be extended to any selected library (scFv, cDNA, libraries based on scaffold proteins) where a unique sequence signature for the desired clones of interest is available."

                "snippets": "George P. Smith first developed phage display technology in 1985 [8], and the technology quickly advanced in the 1990s from peptide libraries (Scott et al., 1990) to recombinant antibody fragment libraries (Breitling et al., 1991)(Barbas et al., 1991)(McCafferty et al., 1990)[13](Tiller et al., 2013)[15]. A major limitation of the traditional phage-panning platform is the laborious workflow and low throughput of obtaining antibody gene sequences relying on Sanger sequencing (Ravn et al., 2013). \n\nTo improve upon the traditional workflow and obtain a more diverse panel of sequences after panning, a commonly used next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform is MiSeq from Illumina. Paired-end MiSeq (2 \u00d7 300 bp) sequencing from Illumina covers segments of about 500 bp and has been successfully applied to the investigation of shorter antibody fragment libraries, such as nanobodies derived from the camelid's variable domain of heavy-chain-only antibodies (Deschaght et al., 2017)(Turner et al., 2016), as well as the shark variable new antigen receptor (VNAR) (Nakada-Masuta et al., 2023).

In this work, we constructed a cDNA library of single domain antibodies from a llama immunized with staphylococcal enterotoxin B. The resulting library was sequenced, resulting in approximately 8.5 million sequences with 5.4 million representing intact, useful sequences. The sequenced library was interrogated using sequences of known SEB-binding single domain antibodies from the library obtained through phage display panning methods in a previous study. New antibodies were identified, produced, and characterized, and were shown to have affinities and melting temperatures comparable to those obtained by traditional panning methods. This demonstrates the utility of using NGS as a complementary tool to phage-displayed biopanning as a means for rapidly obtaining additional antibodies from an immune library. It also shows that phage display, using a library of high diversity, is able to select high quality antibodies even when they are low in frequency.",

We used NGS to mine the functional nanobody repertoire from a phage-displayed camelid immune library directed to the recepteur d\u2019origine nantais (RON) receptor kinase. Challenges to this application of NGS include accurate removal of read errors, correct identification of related sequences, and establishing meaningful inclusion criteria for sequences-of-interest. To this end, a sequence identity threshold was defined to separate unrelated full-length sequence clusters by exploring a large diverse set of publicly available nanobody sequences. When combined with majority-rule consensus building, applying this elegant clustering approach to the NGS data set revealed a wealth of >5,000-enriched candidate RON binders. The huge binding potential predicted by the NGS approach was explored through a set of randomly selected candidates: 90% were confirmed as RON binders, 50% of which functionally blocked RON in an ERK phosphorylation assay. Additional validation came from the correct prediction of all 35 RON binding nanobodies which were identified by a conventional screening campaign of the same immune library. More detailed characterization of a subset of RON binders revealed excellent functional potencies and a promising epitope diversity. In summary, our approach exposes the functional diversity and quality of the outbred camelid heavy chain-only immune response and confirms the power of NGS to identify large numbers of promising nanobodies.",

The variable Ig heavy and Ig light (VH/VL) chain pairs were selected for biophysical characteristics favorable to manufacturing and development. The selection process included multiple parameters, e.g., assessment of protein expression yield, thermal stability and aggregation propensity in fragment antigen binding (Fab) and IgG1 formats, and relative Fab display rate on phage. The framework regions are fixed and the diversified CDRs were designed based on a systematic analysis of a large set of rearranged human antibody sequences. Care was taken to minimize the occurrence of potential posttranslational modification sites within the CDRs. Phage selection was performed against various antigens and unique antibodies with excellent biophysical properties were isolated.

The variable domain of IgNAR (VNAR), a shark single-domain antibody, has attracted attention owing to its favorable physicochemical properties. The phage display method used to screen for optimal VNARs loses sequence diversity because of the bias caused by the differential ease of protein expression in Escherichia coli. Here, we investigated a VNAR selection method that combined panning with various selection pressures and next-generation sequencing (NGS) analyses to obtain additional candidates. Drawing inspiration from the physiological conditions of sharks and the physicochemical properties of VNARs, we examined the effects of NaCl and urea concentrations, low temperature, and preheating at the binding step of panning. VNAR phage libraries generated from Japanese topeshark (Hemitriakis japanica) were enriched under these conditions. We then performed NGS analysis and attempted to select clones that were specifically enriched under each panning condition. The identified VNARs exhibited higher reactivity than those obtained by panning without selection pressure. Additionally, they possess physicochemical properties that reflect their respective selection pressures. These results can greatly enhance our understanding of VNAR properties and offer guidance for the screening of high-quality VNAR clones that are present at low frequencies.",

We have previously reported the construction of a phage display library from a SIV-infected rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) using oligonucleotide primers based on human IG gene sequences. Our previous screening relied on Sanger sequencing, which was inefficient and generated only a few dozen sequences. Here, we re-analyzed this library using single molecule, real-time (SMRT) sequencing on the Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) platform to generate thousands of highly accurate circular consensus sequencing (CCS) reads corresponding to full length single chain fragment variable. CCS data were then analyzed through the international ImMunoGeneTics information system\u00ae (IMGT\u00ae)/HighV-QUEST (www.imgt.org) to identify variable genes and perform statistical analyses. Overall the library was very diverse, with 2,569 different IMGT clonotypes called for the 5,238 IGHV sequences assigned to an IMGT clonotype. Within the library, SIV-specific antibodies represented a relatively limited number of clones, with only 135 different IMGT clonotypes called from 4,594 IGHV-assigned sequences. Our data did confirm that the IGHV4 and IGHV3 gene usage was the most abundant within the rhesus antibodies screened, and that these genes were even more enriched among SIV gp140-specific antibodies. Although a broad range of VH CDR3 amino acid (AA) lengths was observed in the unpanned library, the vast majority of SIV gp140-specific antibodies demonstrated a more uniform VH CDR3 length (20 AA). This uniformity was far less apparent when VH CDR3 were classified according to their clonotype (range: 9\u201325 AA), which we believe is more relevant for specific antibody identification. Only 174 IGKV and 588 IGLV clonotypes were identified within the VL sequences associated with SIV gp140-specific VH. Together, these data strongly suggest that the combination of SMRT sequencing with the IMGT/HighV-QUEST querying tool will facilitate and expedite our understanding of polyclonal antibody responses during SIV infection and may serve to rapidly expand the known scope of macaque V genes utilized during these responses.",

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has recently emerged as a new method for the high throughput characterization of IG and T cell receptor (TR) immune repertoires both in vivo and in vitro. However, challenges remain for the NGS sequencing of scFv from combinatorial libraries owing to the scFv length (>800\u2009bp) and the presence of two variable domains [variable heavy (VH) and variable light (VL) for IG] associated by a peptide linker in a single chain. Here, we show that single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing with the Pacific Biosciences RS II platform allows for the generation of full-length scFv reads obtained from an in vivo selection of scFv-phages in an animal model of atherosclerosis. We first amplified the DNA of the phagemid inserts from scFv-phages eluted from an aortic section at the third round of the in vivo selection. From this amplified DNA, 450,558 reads were obtained from 15 SMRT cells. Highly accurate circular consensus sequences from these reads were generated, filtered by quality and then analyzed by IMGT/HighV-QUEST with the functionality for scFv. Full-length scFv were identified and characterized in 348,659 reads. Full-length scFv sequencing is an absolute requirement for analyzing the associated VH and VL domains enriched during the in vivo panning rounds. In order to further validate the ability of SMRT sequencing to provide high quality, full-length scFv sequences, we tracked the reads of an scFv-phage clone P3 previously identified by biological assays and Sanger sequencing. Sixty P3 reads showed 100% identity with the full-length scFv of 767\u2009bp, 53 of them covering the whole insert of 977\u2009bp, which encompassed the primer sequences. The remaining seven reads were identical over a shortened length of 939\u2009bp that excludes the vicinity of primers at both ends. Interestingly these reads were obtained from each of the 15 SMRT cells. Thus, the SMRT sequencing method and the IMGT/HighV-QUEST functionality for scFv provides a straightforward protocol for characterization of full-length scFv from combinatorial phage libraries."

In alphabeta T cells, which primarily recognize peptide antigens presented by major histocompatibility complex molecules, most of this receptor diversity is contained within the third complementarity-determining region (CDR3) of the T-cell receptor (TCR) alpha and beta chains. Although it has been estimated that the adaptive immune system can generate up to 10(16) distinct alphabeta pairs, direct assessment of TCR CDR3 diversity has not proved amenable to standard capillary electrophoresis-based DNA sequencing. We developed a novel experimental and computational approach to measure TCR CDR3 diversity based on single-molecule DNA sequencing, and used this approach to determine the CDR3 sequence in millions of rearranged TCRbeta genes from T cells of 2 adults. We find that total TCRbeta receptor diversity is at least 4-fold higher than previous estimates, and the diversity in the subset of CD45RO(+) antigen-experienced alphabeta T cells is at least 10-fold higher than previous estimates. These methods should prove valuable for assessment of alphabeta T-cell repertoire diversity after hematopoietic cell transplantation, in states of congenital or acquired immunodeficiency, and during normal aging.",

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has revolutionized phage display by enabling high-throughput analysis of selected libraries, dramatically increasing the depth and efficiency of the screening process. (LLM Memory)",
                "text": "\nPhage display is a laboratory technique that uses bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) to connect proteins with the genetic information that encodes them. In this approach, foreign DNA fragments are inserted into phage coat protein genes, resulting in the expression of fusion proteins on the phage surface while the genetic information remains packaged inside the phage particle. This physical linkage between genotype and phenotype enables researchers to select phages displaying proteins or peptides with desired binding properties from large libraries containing billions of variants. Traditional phage display screening, introduced in the 1980s, relied on multiple rounds of selection (biopanning) followed by Sanger sequencing of a limited number of individual clones, which provided only a narrow view of the selected library diversity. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">\n\nNext-generation sequencing has transformed the landscape of phage display library development and analysis. NGS technologies can sequence millions to billions of DNA fragments simultaneously, allowing researchers to analyze phage display libraries at unprecedented depth and resolution. This integration has enabled the characterization of entire libraries rather than just a few selected clones, providing comprehensive insights into selection dynamics, identifying rare binders that might be lost in conventional approaches, and reducing the number of selection rounds needed. The evolution of NGS platforms from early systems like 454 pyrosequencing and Illumina to more recent technologies such as Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore has progressively improved read length, accuracy, and throughput, making them increasingly valuable for phage display applications. The combination of phage display with NGS has dramatically enhanced our ability to discover novel binding molecules for applications in drug development, diagnostics, and basic research. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">",

                "text": "\nPhage display technology, first developed by George P. Smith in 1985 <Paper corpusId=\"9420027\" paperTitle=\"(Smith, 1985)\" isShortName></Paper>, has undergone significant evolution in its sequencing methodologies over the past decades. Traditional phage display screening relied on multiple rounds of selection (biopanning) followed by Sanger sequencing of randomly picked individual clones, which provided only a narrow view of the selected library diversity <Paper corpusId=\"196688341\" paperTitle=\"(He et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"277414495\" paperTitle=\"(Pan et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>. This approach was laborious, time-consuming, and limited researchers to analyzing only a small fraction of the potential binders in a library <Paper corpusId=\"269422804\" paperTitle=\"(Garcia-Calvo et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe integration of next-generation sequencing (NGS) with phage display marked a transformative advancement in the field. As noted by Dias-Neto and colleagues in their pioneering work, NGS eliminated two major rate-limiting steps in phage display: the counting of transducing units and the sequencing of encoded displayed ligands <Paper corpusId=\"3787363\" paperTitle=\"(Dias-Neto et al., 2009)\" isShortName></Paper>. This integration enabled researchers to analyze phage display outputs at unprecedented depth, with the ability to sequence thousands to millions of peptide inserts in parallel <Paper corpusId=\"257516339\" paperTitle=\"(Sloth et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe evolution of NGS platforms has progressively enhanced phage display applications. Early implementations utilized 454 pyrosequencing and Illumina technologies, which offered substantial improvements over Sanger sequencing but still had limitations in read length <Paper corpusId=\"15850107\" paperTitle=\"(Georgieva et al., 2011)\" isShortName></Paper>. The Illumina MiSeq platform with paired-end sequencing (2 \u00d7 300 bp) became widely adopted for shorter antibody fragments like nanobodies <Paper corpusId=\"15659069\" paperTitle=\"(Turner et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"15881717\" paperTitle=\"(Deschaght et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper> and single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) <Paper corpusId=\"277414495\" paperTitle=\"(Pan et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nFor longer sequences such as full-length antibody fragments, third-generation sequencing technologies emerged as critical tools. Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing offered the capability to generate reads of 10-15 kb in length, enabling the analysis of complete antibody sequences <Paper corpusId=\"8314507\" paperTitle=\"(Hemadou et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"3577857\" paperTitle=\"(Han et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>. Similarly, Oxford Nanopore technologies have been applied to characterize phage display libraries throughout selection processes <Paper corpusId=\"269422804\" paperTitle=\"(Garcia-Calvo et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe integration of NGS with phage display has yielded several significant advantages. It has enabled the comprehensive characterization of entire libraries rather than just a few selected clones <Paper corpusId=\"196688341\" paperTitle=\"(He et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>, facilitated the identification of rare binders that might be missed in conventional approaches <Paper corpusId=\"8102407\" paperTitle=\"(Matochko et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper>, and reduced the number of selection rounds needed <Paper corpusId=\"215318134\" paperTitle=\"(Christiansen et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>. Additionally, NGS has allowed researchers to gain insights into selection dynamics and to identify binding motifs after a single round of phage selection, reducing propagation-related bias <Paper corpusId=\"12475024\" paperTitle=\"(Rebollo et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe application of bioinformatics tools to analyze the vast amounts of data generated by NGS has further enhanced the power of this approach. Researchers have developed methods to cluster sequences, identify motifs, and distinguish specific binders from non-specific ones <Paper corpusId=\"215318134\" paperTitle=\"(Christiansen et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>. These advances have created a more streamlined, less labor-intensive process that offers increased sensitivity, reduced variability, enhanced linearity, and improved accuracy at a much lower cost compared to traditional methods <Paper corpusId=\"3787363\" paperTitle=\"(Dias-Neto et al., 2009)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe evolution of phage display library sequencing methods continues to accelerate, with NGS technologies becoming increasingly accessible and powerful tools for antibody and peptide discovery <Paper corpusId=\"278637023\" paperTitle=\"(Tucker et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"244471976\" paperTitle=\"(Aghebati-Maleki et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. These advancements have created unprecedented opportunities for developing therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and have provided researchers with an exceptional platform for exploring the diversity and complexity of phage display libraries.",

                            "George P. Smith first developed phage display technology in 1985 [8], and the technology quickly advanced in the 1990s from peptide libraries (Scott et al., 1990) to recombinant antibody fragment libraries (Breitling et al., 1991)(Barbas et al., 1991)(McCafferty et al., 1990)[13](Tiller et al., 2013)[15]. A major limitation of the traditional phage-panning platform is the laborious workflow and low throughput of obtaining antibody gene sequences relying on Sanger sequencing (Ravn et al., 2013). \n\nTo improve upon the traditional workflow and obtain a more diverse panel of sequences after panning, a commonly used next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform is MiSeq from Illumina. Paired-end MiSeq (2 \u00d7 300 bp) sequencing from Illumina covers segments of about 500 bp and has been successfully applied to the investigation of shorter antibody fragment libraries, such as nanobodies derived from the camelid's variable domain of heavy-chain-only antibodies (Deschaght et al., 2017)(Turner et al., 2016), as well as the shark variable new antigen receptor (VNAR) (Nakada-Masuta et al., 2023). Paired-end MiSeq can also read amplicons long enough to cover all CDRs in single-chain Fv (scFv) (L\u00f6vgren et al., 2016). However, paired-end MiSeq is not sufficient to cover longer light and heavy chain-combined sequences (1.2-1.5 kb), which are linked together in Human Fab libraries (Glanville et al., 2015)(Dekosky et al., 2014). \n\nThird-generation NGS technology such as Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) can bridge the shortcomings of current MiSeq sequencing [23], as it is possible to achieve long sequencing reads of 10 to 15 kb in length with single-molecule real-time technology (SMRT) (H\u00e9madou et al., 2017). PacBio's NGS had been applied successfully to scFv fragment libraries [25](Han et al., 2018)."

We present a side-by-side comparison of all steps and report an integrated experimental system that greatly streamlines and expedites the entire procedure while markedly reducing its associated costs about 250-fold compared to conventional phage display selection.

                            "The advent of phage display peptide libraries has enabled the high-throughput screening on a variety of important cellular and molecular targets (Li et al., 2008)(Wu et al., 2008)(Zang et al., 2009)(Newton et al., 2006)(Arap et al., 1998). Random peptide sequences expressed on the phage surface can interact with the target of interest and phages expressing peptides that bind specifically to the target can be isolated. Phage display screening, called biopanning, consists of iterative rounds in which the library is presented to the target of interest, and the selected phage pool is amplified by infection of Escherichia coli cells. The amplified phages serve as input for the subsequent round of biopanning (Smith, 2019). Traditionally, biopanning outputs have been analyzed by Sanger sequencing. This sequencing approach can identify only a limited number of peptides in the library. Recent advances have combined phage display with next-generation sequencing (NGS), allowing for the sequencing of thousands to millions of peptide inserts in parallel (Dias-Neto et al., 2009)(Hoen et al., 2012)(Matochko et al., 2012). This eliminates the laborious procedure of picking random clones and provides increased resolution of the biopanning output compared to Sanger sequencing. NGS allows researchers to analyze the composition of large peptide libraries on a deeper scale."

In this work, we constructed a cDNA library of single domain antibodies from a llama immunized with staphylococcal enterotoxin B. The resulting library was sequenced, resulting in approximately 8.5 million sequences with 5.4 million representing intact, useful sequences. The sequenced library was interrogated using sequences of known SEB-binding single domain antibodies from the library obtained through phage display panning methods in a previous study. New antibodies were identified, produced, and characterized, and were shown to have affinities and melting temperatures comparable to those obtained by traditional panning methods. This demonstrates the utility of using NGS as a complementary tool to phage-displayed biopanning as a means for rapidly obtaining additional antibodies from an immune library. It also shows that phage display, using a library of high diversity, is able to select high quality antibodies even when they are low in frequency."

                            "Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has been applied successfully to the field of therapeutic antibody discovery, often outperforming conventional screening campaigns which tend to identify only the more abundant selective antibody sequences. We used NGS to mine the functional nanobody repertoire from a phage-displayed camelid immune library directed to the recepteur d\u2019origine nantais (RON) receptor kinase. Challenges to this application of NGS include accurate removal of read errors, correct identification of related sequences, and establishing meaningful inclusion criteria for sequences-of-interest. To this end, a sequence identity threshold was defined to separate unrelated full-length sequence clusters by exploring a large diverse set of publicly available nanobody sequences. When combined with majority-rule consensus building, applying this elegant clustering approach to the NGS data set revealed a wealth of >5,000-enriched candidate RON binders. The huge binding potential predicted by the NGS approach was explored through a set of randomly selected candidates: 90% were confirmed as RON binders, 50% of which functionally blocked RON in an ERK phosphorylation assay. Additional validation came from the correct prediction of all 35 RON binding nanobodies which were identified by a conventional screening campaign of the same immune library. More detailed characterization of a subset of RON binders revealed excellent functional potencies and a promising epitope diversity. In summary, our approach exposes the functional diversity and quality of the outbred camelid heavy chain-only immune response and confirms the power of NGS to identify large numbers of promising nanobodies."

                            "Phage-display selection of immunoglobulin (IG) or antibody single chain Fragment variable (scFv) from combinatorial libraries is widely used for identifying new antibodies for novel targets. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has recently emerged as a new method for the high throughput characterization of IG and T cell receptor (TR) immune repertoires both in vivo and in vitro. However, challenges remain for the NGS sequencing of scFv from combinatorial libraries owing to the scFv length (>800\u2009bp) and the presence of two variable domains [variable heavy (VH) and variable light (VL) for IG] associated by a peptide linker in a single chain. Here, we show that single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing with the Pacific Biosciences RS II platform allows for the generation of full-length scFv reads obtained from an in vivo selection of scFv-phages in an animal model of atherosclerosis. We first amplified the DNA of the phagemid inserts from scFv-phages eluted from an aortic section at the third round of the in vivo selection. From this amplified DNA, 450,558 reads were obtained from 15 SMRT cells. Highly accurate circular consensus sequences from these reads were generated, filtered by quality and then analyzed by IMGT/HighV-QUEST with the functionality for scFv. Full-length scFv were identified and characterized in 348,659 reads. Full-length scFv sequencing is an absolute requirement for analyzing the associated VH and VL domains enriched during the in vivo panning rounds. In order to further validate the ability of SMRT sequencing to provide high quality, full-length scFv sequences, we tracked the reads of an scFv-phage clone P3 previously identified by biological assays and Sanger sequencing. Sixty P3 reads showed 100% identity with the full-length scFv of 767\u2009bp, 53 of them covering the whole insert of 977\u2009bp, which encompassed the primer sequences. The remaining seven reads were identical over a shortened length of 939\u2009bp that excludes the vicinity of primers at both ends. Interestingly these reads were obtained from each of the 15 SMRT cells. Thus, the SMRT sequencing method and the IMGT/HighV-QUEST functionality for scFv provides a straightforward protocol for characterization of full-length scFv from combinatorial phage libraries."

                            "The simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)/macaque model of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome pathogenesis is critical for furthering our understanding of the role of antibody responses in the prevention of HIV infection, and will only increase in importance as macaque immunoglobulin (IG) gene databases are expanded. We have previously reported the construction of a phage display library from a SIV-infected rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) using oligonucleotide primers based on human IG gene sequences. Our previous screening relied on Sanger sequencing, which was inefficient and generated only a few dozen sequences. Here, we re-analyzed this library using single molecule, real-time (SMRT) sequencing on the Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) platform to generate thousands of highly accurate circular consensus sequencing (CCS) reads corresponding to full length single chain fragment variable. CCS data were then analyzed through the international ImMunoGeneTics information system\u00ae (IMGT\u00ae)/HighV-QUEST (www.imgt.org) to identify variable genes and perform statistical analyses. Overall the library was very diverse, with 2,569 different IMGT clonotypes called for the 5,238 IGHV sequences assigned to an IMGT clonotype. Within the library, SIV-specific antibodies represented a relatively limited number of clones, with only 135 different IMGT clonotypes called from 4,594 IGHV-assigned sequences. Our data did confirm that the IGHV4 and IGHV3 gene usage was the most abundant within the rhesus antibodies screened, and that these genes were even more enriched among SIV gp140-specific antibodies. Although a broad range of VH CDR3 amino acid (AA) lengths was observed in the unpanned library, the vast majority of SIV gp140-specific antibodies demonstrated a more uniform VH CDR3 length (20 AA). This uniformity was far less apparent when VH CDR3 were classified according to their clonotype (range: 9\u201325 AA), which we believe is more relevant for specific antibody identification. Only 174 IGKV and 588 IGLV clonotypes were identified within the VL sequences associated with SIV gp140-specific VH. Together, these data strongly suggest that the combination of SMRT sequencing with the IMGT/HighV-QUEST querying tool will facilitate and expedite our understanding of polyclonal antibody responses during SIV infection and may serve to rapidly expand the known scope of macaque V genes utilized during these responses."

                            "Phage display empowered the development of proteins with new function and ligands for clinically relevant targets. In this report, we use next-generation sequencing to analyze phage-displayed libraries and uncover a strong bias induced by amplification preferences of phage in bacteria. This bias favors fast-growing sequences that collectively constitute <0.01% of the available diversity. Specifically, a library of 109 random 7-mer peptides (Ph.D.-7) includes a few thousand sequences that grow quickly (the \u2018parasites\u2019), which are the sequences that are typically identified in phage display screens published to date. A similar collapse was observed in other libraries. Using Illumina and Ion Torrent sequencing and multiple biological replicates of amplification of Ph.D.-7 library, we identified a focused population of 770 \u2018parasites\u2019. In all, 197 sequences from this population have been identified in literature reports that used Ph.D.-7 library. Many of these enriched sequences have confirmed function (e.g. target binding capacity). The bias in the literature, thus, can be viewed as a selection with two different selection pressures: (i) target-binding selection, and (ii) amplification-induced selection. Enrichment of parasitic sequences could be minimized if amplification bias is removed. Here, we demonstrate that emulsion amplification in libraries of \u223c106 diverse clones prevents the biased selection of parasitic clones."

                            "Phage display is a prominent screening technique with a multitude of applications including therapeutic antibody development and mapping of antigen epitopes. In this study, phages were selected based on their interaction with patient serum and exhaustively characterised by high-throughput sequencing. A bioinformatics approach was developed in order to identify peptide motifs of interest based on clustering and contrasting to control samples. Comparison of patient and control samples confirmed a major issue in phage display, namely the selection of unspecific peptides. The potential of the bioinformatic approach was demonstrated by identifying epitopes of a prominent peanut allergen, Ara h 1, in sera from patients with severe peanut allergy. The identified epitopes were confirmed by high-density peptide micro-arrays. The present study demonstrates that high-throughput sequencing can empower phage display by (i) enabling the analysis of complex biological samples, (ii) circumventing the traditional laborious picking and functional testing of individual phage clones and (iii) reducing the number of selection rounds."

                            "High-throughput sequencing was previously applied to phage-selected peptides in order to gain insight into the abundance and diversity of isolated peptides. Herein we developed a procedure to efficiently compare the sequences of large numbers of phage-selected peptides for the purpose of identifying target-binding peptide motifs. We applied the procedure to analyze bicyclic peptides isolated against five different protein targets: sortase A, urokinase-type plasminogen activator, coagulation factor XII, plasma kallikrein and streptavidin. We optimized sequence data filters to reduce biases originating from the sequencing method and developed sequence correction algorithms to prevent identification of false consensus motifs. With our strategy, we were able to identify rare target-binding peptide motifs, as well as to define more precisely consensus sequences and sub-groups of consensus sequences. This information is valuable to choose peptide leads for drug development and it facilitates identification of epitopes. We furthermore show that binding motifs can be identified after a single round of phage selection. Such a selection regimen reduces propagation-related bias and may facilitate application of phage display in non-specialized laboratories, as procedures such as bacterial infection, phage propagation and purification are not required."

These technological advancements have overcome previous limitations in read length, allowing researchers to characterize entire antibody fragments rather than just individual domains. (13 sources)",
                "text": "\nThe integration of next-generation sequencing (NGS) with phage display has been transformed by continuous improvements in sequencing technologies, each offering distinct advantages for antibody discovery. Early applications of NGS to phage display relied primarily on second-generation sequencing platforms, particularly Illumina technology, which offered relatively low error rates and costs compared to traditional Sanger sequencing <Paper corpusId=\"3155125\" paperTitle=\"(Hu et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>. The Illumina MiSeq platform with paired-end sequencing (2 \u00d7 300 bp) became widely adopted for analyzing shorter antibody fragments, covering segments of approximately 500 bp. This capability made it suitable for sequencing nanobodies derived from camelid heavy-chain-only antibodies <Paper corpusId=\"277414495\" paperTitle=\"(Pan et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"15659069\" paperTitle=\"(Turner et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"15881717\" paperTitle=\"(Deschaght et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>, shark variable new antigen receptors (VNARs) <Paper corpusId=\"277414495\" paperTitle=\"(Pan et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"264468961\" paperTitle=\"(Nakada-Masuta et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>, and single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) that could fit within the read length limitations.\n\nHowever, a significant limitation of second-generation sequencing platforms was their inability to sequence full-length antibody fragments. The maximal read length of Illumina sequencing allowed researchers to sequence only portions of antibody fragments (e.g., the VH region), making the reconstruction of entire antibody sequences challenging <Paper corpusId=\"247312322\" paperTitle=\"(Zambrano et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. This limitation was particularly problematic for longer antibody formats such as antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) or complete light and heavy chain combinations (1.2-1.5 kb) used in human Fab libraries <Paper corpusId=\"277414495\" paperTitle=\"(Pan et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe advent of third-generation sequencing technologies has addressed these length constraints, representing a significant technical advancement for phage display applications. Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing technology has emerged as a particularly valuable tool, capable of generating reads of 10-15 kb in length <Paper corpusId=\"277414495\" paperTitle=\"(Pan et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"8314507\" paperTitle=\"(Hemadou et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>. This capability has enabled the accurate interrogation of full-length single-chain Fv (scFv) libraries <Paper corpusId=\"229940603\" paperTitle=\"(Nannini et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. By using techniques such as hairpin adaptor loop ligation, researchers have been able to achieve highly accurate circular consensus sequencing (CCS) reads corresponding to complete scFv sequences <Paper corpusId=\"3577857\" paperTitle=\"(Han et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nSimilarly, Oxford Nanopore technologies have been applied to characterize phage display libraries throughout selection processes, offering another long-read solution <Paper corpusId=\"247312322\" paperTitle=\"(Zambrano et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. Both PacBio and Oxford Nanopore platforms have enabled researchers to overcome the previous requirement to physically recover clones of interest through laborious methods, as the complete antibody sequences can now be determined directly from sequencing data <Paper corpusId=\"247312322\" paperTitle=\"(Zambrano et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe application of these advanced NGS technologies has expanded beyond antibody discovery to include the sequencing of paired human heavy and light chain repertoires from isolated na\u00efve and antigen-specific B cells, as well as T-cell receptor and antibody display repertoires <Paper corpusId=\"3573710\" paperTitle=\"(Rouet et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"206880573\" paperTitle=\"(Robins et al., 2009)\" isShortName></Paper>. This broader application of NGS to immunoglobulin gene sequencing (Ig-seq) has transformed our understanding of humoral immune responses and can be applied to detect B-cell malignancies with high sensitivity, discover antigen-specific antibodies, guide vaccine development, and understand autoimmunity <Paper corpusId=\"28880618\" paperTitle=\"(Georgiou et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe continuous improvement in NGS technologies, combined with advances in computational analysis tools, has enabled researchers to reduce sequencing artifacts, achieve more precise quantification of clonal diversity, and extract more pertinent biological information from phage display libraries <Paper corpusId=\"28880618\" paperTitle=\"(Georgiou et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>. As sequencing costs continue to decrease and data analysis capabilities improve, these technological advancements are poised to further enhance the development and optimization of phage display libraries for therapeutic and diagnostic applications <Paper corpusId=\"47390966\" paperTitle=\"(Muir et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>.",

                            "George P. Smith first developed phage display technology in 1985 [8], and the technology quickly advanced in the 1990s from peptide libraries (Scott et al., 1990) to recombinant antibody fragment libraries (Breitling et al., 1991)(Barbas et al., 1991)(McCafferty et al., 1990)[13](Tiller et al., 2013)[15]. A major limitation of the traditional phage-panning platform is the laborious workflow and low throughput of obtaining antibody gene sequences relying on Sanger sequencing (Ravn et al., 2013). \n\nTo improve upon the traditional workflow and obtain a more diverse panel of sequences after panning, a commonly used next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform is MiSeq from Illumina. Paired-end MiSeq (2 \u00d7 300 bp) sequencing from Illumina covers segments of about 500 bp and has been successfully applied to the investigation of shorter antibody fragment libraries, such as nanobodies derived from the camelid's variable domain of heavy-chain-only antibodies (Deschaght et al., 2017)(Turner et al., 2016), as well as the shark variable new antigen receptor (VNAR) (Nakada-Masuta et al., 2023). Paired-end MiSeq can also read amplicons long enough to cover all CDRs in single-chain Fv (scFv) (L\u00f6vgren et al., 2016). However, paired-end MiSeq is not sufficient to cover longer light and heavy chain-combined sequences (1.2-1.5 kb), which are linked together in Human Fab libraries (Glanville et al., 2015)(Dekosky et al., 2014). \n\nThird-generation NGS technology such as Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) can bridge the shortcomings of current MiSeq sequencing [23], as it is possible to achieve long sequencing reads of 10 to 15 kb in length with single-molecule real-time technology (SMRT) (H\u00e9madou et al., 2017). PacBio's NGS had been applied successfully to scFv fragment libraries [25](Han et al., 2018)."

                            "Next-Generation Sequencing and bioinformatics are powerful tools for analyzing the large number of DNA sequences present in an immune library. In this work, we constructed a cDNA library of single domain antibodies from a llama immunized with staphylococcal enterotoxin B. The resulting library was sequenced, resulting in approximately 8.5 million sequences with 5.4 million representing intact, useful sequences. The sequenced library was interrogated using sequences of known SEB-binding single domain antibodies from the library obtained through phage display panning methods in a previous study. New antibodies were identified, produced, and characterized, and were shown to have affinities and melting temperatures comparable to those obtained by traditional panning methods. This demonstrates the utility of using NGS as a complementary tool to phage-displayed biopanning as a means for rapidly obtaining additional antibodies from an immune library. It also shows that phage display, using a library of high diversity, is able to select high quality antibodies even when they are low in frequency."

We used NGS to mine the functional nanobody repertoire from a phage-displayed camelid immune library directed to the recepteur d\u2019origine nantais (RON) receptor kinase. Challenges to this application of NGS include accurate removal of read errors, correct identification of related sequences, and establishing meaningful inclusion criteria for sequences-of-interest. To this end, a sequence identity threshold was defined to separate unrelated full-length sequence clusters by exploring a large diverse set of publicly available nanobody sequences. When combined with majority-rule consensus building, applying this elegant clustering approach to the NGS data set revealed a wealth of >5,000-enriched candidate RON binders. The huge binding potential predicted by the NGS approach was explored through a set of randomly selected candidates: 90% were confirmed as RON binders, 50% of which functionally blocked RON in an ERK phosphorylation assay. Additional validation came from the correct prediction of all 35 RON binding nanobodies which were identified by a conventional screening campaign of the same immune library. More detailed characterization of a subset of RON binders revealed excellent functional potencies and a promising epitope diversity. In summary, our approach exposes the functional diversity and quality of the outbred camelid heavy chain-only immune response and confirms the power of NGS to identify large numbers of promising nanobodies."

                            "Diverse candidate antibodies are needed to successfully identify therapeutic and diagnostic applications. The variable domain of IgNAR (VNAR), a shark single-domain antibody, has attracted attention owing to its favorable physicochemical properties. The phage display method used to screen for optimal VNARs loses sequence diversity because of the bias caused by the differential ease of protein expression in Escherichia coli. Here, we investigated a VNAR selection method that combined panning with various selection pressures and next-generation sequencing (NGS) analyses to obtain additional candidates. Drawing inspiration from the physiological conditions of sharks and the physicochemical properties of VNARs, we examined the effects of NaCl and urea concentrations, low temperature, and preheating at the binding step of panning. VNAR phage libraries generated from Japanese topeshark (Hemitriakis japanica) were enriched under these conditions. We then performed NGS analysis and attempted to select clones that were specifically enriched under each panning condition. The identified VNARs exhibited higher reactivity than those obtained by panning without selection pressure. Additionally, they possess physicochemical properties that reflect their respective selection pressures. These results can greatly enhance our understanding of VNAR properties and offer guidance for the screening of high-quality VNAR clones that are present at low frequencies."

Based on this concept, NGS was adopted for the screening of antibody libraries to identify potential binders by monitoring the enrichment of a given sequence during the selection cycles (Yang et al., 2017). Parallel comparative screenings of antibody libraries by traditional ELISA and NGS have demonstrated that, beyond top-ranking clones efficiently identified by both technologies, deep sequencing enables the discovery of many more specific binders among rare clones with potentially interesting features [38](Ljungars et al., 2019)",
                            "Although next-generation sequencing improved the quality of phage display, there are at least two key limitations: (1) the maximal read length of second-generation sequencing technologies (i.e., Illumina) allows to sequence only a portion of scFvs (e.g., VH), making the reconstruction of the entire antibody fragment challenging; (2) to physically fish out in silico-identified clones of interest, a laborious recovery step is necessary. Long reads obtainable from third-generation sequencing allow achieving quali-quantitative information of the entire scFvs."

                            "Phage-display selection of immunoglobulin (IG) or antibody single chain Fragment variable (scFv) from combinatorial libraries is widely used for identifying new antibodies for novel targets. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has recently emerged as a new method for the high throughput characterization of IG and T cell receptor (TR) immune repertoires both in vivo and in vitro. However, challenges remain for the NGS sequencing of scFv from combinatorial libraries owing to the scFv length (>800\u2009bp) and the presence of two variable domains [variable heavy (VH) and variable light (VL) for IG] associated by a peptide linker in a single chain. Here, we show that single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing with the Pacific Biosciences RS II platform allows for the generation of full-length scFv reads obtained from an in vivo selection of scFv-phages in an animal model of atherosclerosis. We first amplified the DNA of the phagemid inserts from scFv-phages eluted from an aortic section at the third round of the in vivo selection. From this amplified DNA, 450,558 reads were obtained from 15 SMRT cells. Highly accurate circular consensus sequences from these reads were generated, filtered by quality and then analyzed by IMGT/HighV-QUEST with the functionality for scFv. Full-length scFv were identified and characterized in 348,659 reads. Full-length scFv sequencing is an absolute requirement for analyzing the associated VH and VL domains enriched during the in vivo panning rounds. In order to further validate the ability of SMRT sequencing to provide high quality, full-length scFv sequences, we tracked the reads of an scFv-phage clone P3 previously identified by biological assays and Sanger sequencing. Sixty P3 reads showed 100% identity with the full-length scFv of 767\u2009bp, 53 of them covering the whole insert of 977\u2009bp, which encompassed the primer sequences. The remaining seven reads were identical over a shortened length of 939\u2009bp that excludes the vicinity of primers at both ends. Interestingly these reads were obtained from each of the 15 SMRT cells. Thus, the SMRT sequencing method and the IMGT/HighV-QUEST functionality for scFv provides a straightforward protocol for characterization of full-length scFv from combinatorial phage libraries."

                            "Phage display technology in combination with next-generation sequencing (NGS) currently is a state-of-the-art method for the enrichment and isolation of monoclonal antibodies from diverse libraries. However, the current NGS methods employed for sequencing phage display libraries are limited by the short contiguous read lengths associated with second-generation sequencing platforms. Consequently, the identification of antibody sequences has conventionally been restricted to individual antibody domains or to the analysis of single domain binding moieties such as camelid VHH or cartilaginous fish IgNAR antibodies. In this study, we report the application of third-generation sequencing to address this limitation. We used single molecule real time (SMRT) sequencing coupled with hairpin adaptor loop ligation to facilitate the accurate interrogation of full-length single-chain Fv (scFv) libraries."

                            "The simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)/macaque model of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome pathogenesis is critical for furthering our understanding of the role of antibody responses in the prevention of HIV infection, and will only increase in importance as macaque immunoglobulin (IG) gene databases are expanded. We have previously reported the construction of a phage display library from a SIV-infected rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) using oligonucleotide primers based on human IG gene sequences. Our previous screening relied on Sanger sequencing, which was inefficient and generated only a few dozen sequences. Here, we re-analyzed this library using single molecule, real-time (SMRT) sequencing on the Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) platform to generate thousands of highly accurate circular consensus sequencing (CCS) reads corresponding to full length single chain fragment variable. CCS data were then analyzed through the international ImMunoGeneTics information system\u00ae (IMGT\u00ae)/HighV-QUEST (www.imgt.org) to identify variable genes and perform statistical analyses. Overall the library was very diverse, with 2,569 different IMGT clonotypes called for the 5,238 IGHV sequences assigned to an IMGT clonotype. Within the library, SIV-specific antibodies represented a relatively limited number of clones, with only 135 different IMGT clonotypes called from 4,594 IGHV-assigned sequences. Our data did confirm that the IGHV4 and IGHV3 gene usage was the most abundant within the rhesus antibodies screened, and that these genes were even more enriched among SIV gp140-specific antibodies. Although a broad range of VH CDR3 amino acid (AA) lengths was observed in the unpanned library, the vast majority of SIV gp140-specific antibodies demonstrated a more uniform VH CDR3 length (20 AA). This uniformity was far less apparent when VH CDR3 were classified according to their clonotype (range: 9\u201325 AA), which we believe is more relevant for specific antibody identification. Only 174 IGKV and 588 IGLV clonotypes were identified within the VL sequences associated with SIV gp140-specific VH. Together, these data strongly suggest that the combination of SMRT sequencing with the IMGT/HighV-QUEST querying tool will facilitate and expedite our understanding of polyclonal antibody responses during SIV infection and may serve to rapidly expand the known scope of macaque V genes utilized during these responses."

                            "The adaptive immune system uses several strategies to generate a repertoire of T- and B-cell antigen receptors with sufficient diversity to recognize the universe of potential pathogens. In alphabeta T cells, which primarily recognize peptide antigens presented by major histocompatibility complex molecules, most of this receptor diversity is contained within the third complementarity-determining region (CDR3) of the T-cell receptor (TCR) alpha and beta chains. Although it has been estimated that the adaptive immune system can generate up to 10(16) distinct alphabeta pairs, direct assessment of TCR CDR3 diversity has not proved amenable to standard capillary electrophoresis-based DNA sequencing. We developed a novel experimental and computational approach to measure TCR CDR3 diversity based on single-molecule DNA sequencing, and used this approach to determine the CDR3 sequence in millions of rearranged TCRbeta genes from T cells of 2 adults. We find that total TCRbeta receptor diversity is at least 4-fold higher than previous estimates, and the diversity in the subset of CD45RO(+) antigen-experienced alphabeta T cells is at least 10-fold higher than previous estimates. These methods should prove valuable for assessment of alphabeta T-cell repertoire diversity after hematopoietic cell transplantation, in states of congenital or acquired immunodeficiency, and during normal aging."

Information gained from high-throughput DNA sequencing of immunoglobulin genes (Ig-seq) can be applied to detect B-cell malignancies with high sensitivity, to discover antibodies specific for antigens of interest, to guide vaccine development and to understand autoimmunity. Rapid progress in the development of experimental protocols and informatics analysis tools is helping to reduce sequencing artifacts, to achieve more precise quantification of clonal diversity and to extract the most pertinent biological information. That said, broader application of Ig-seq, especially in clinical settings, will require the development of a standardized experimental design framework that will enable the sharing and meta-analysis of sequencing data generated by different laboratories."

We present a side-by-side comparison of all steps and report an integrated experimental system that greatly streamlines and expedites the entire procedure while markedly reducing its associated costs about 250-fold compared to conventional phage display selection. We show that this new methodology is not only much faster and less laborintensive, but allows rigorous quantification with improved overall accuracy."

                            "The advent of phage display peptide libraries has enabled the high-throughput screening on a variety of important cellular and molecular targets (Li et al., 2008)(Wu et al., 2008)(Zang et al., 2009)(Newton et al., 2006)(Arap et al., 1998). Random peptide sequences expressed on the phage surface can interact with the target of interest and phages expressing peptides that bind specifically to the target can be isolated. Phage display screening, called biopanning, consists of iterative rounds in which the library is presented to the target of interest, and the selected phage pool is amplified by infection of Escherichia coli cells. The amplified phages serve as input for the subsequent round of biopanning (Smith, 2019). Traditionally, biopanning outputs have been analyzed by Sanger sequencing. This sequencing approach can identify only a limited number of peptides in the library. Recent advances have combined phage display with next-generation sequencing (NGS), allowing for the sequencing of thousands to millions of peptide inserts in parallel (Dias-Neto et al., 2009)(Hoen et al., 2012)(Matochko et al., 2012). This eliminates the laborious procedure of picking random clones and provides increased resolution of the biopanning output compared to Sanger sequencing. NGS allows researchers to analyze the composition of large peptide libraries on a deeper scale."

In this work, we constructed a cDNA library of single domain antibodies from a llama immunized with staphylococcal enterotoxin B. The resulting library was sequenced, resulting in approximately 8.5 million sequences with 5.4 million representing intact, useful sequences. The sequenced library was interrogated using sequences of known SEB-binding single domain antibodies from the library obtained through phage display panning methods in a previous study. New antibodies were identified, produced, and characterized, and were shown to have affinities and melting temperatures comparable to those obtained by traditional panning methods. This demonstrates the utility of using NGS as a complementary tool to phage-displayed biopanning as a means for rapidly obtaining additional antibodies from an immune library. It also shows that phage display, using a library of high diversity, is able to select high quality antibodies even when they are low in frequency."

Based on this concept, NGS was adopted for the screening of antibody libraries to identify potential binders by monitoring the enrichment of a given sequence during the selection cycles (Yang et al., 2017). Parallel comparative screenings of antibody libraries by traditional ELISA and NGS have demonstrated that, beyond top-ranking clones efficiently identified by both technologies, deep sequencing enables the discovery of many more specific binders among rare clones with potentially interesting features [38](Ljungars et al., 2019)",
                            "Although next-generation sequencing improved the quality of phage display, there are at least two key limitations: (1) the maximal read length of second-generation sequencing technologies (i.e., Illumina) allows to sequence only a portion of scFvs (e.g., VH), making the reconstruction of the entire antibody fragment challenging; (2) to physically fish out in silico-identified clones of interest, a laborious recovery step is necessary. Long reads obtainable from third-generation sequencing allow achieving quali-quantitative information of the entire scFvs."

                            "Phage display technology is a common approach for discovery of therapeutic antibodies. Drug candidates are typically isolated in two steps: First, a pool of antibodies is enriched through consecutive rounds of selection on a target antigen, and then individual clones are characterized in a screening procedure. When whole cells are used as targets, as in phenotypic discovery, the output phage pool typically contains thousands of antibodies, binding, in theory, hundreds of different cell surface receptors. Clonal expansion throughout the phage display enrichment process is affected by multiple factors resulting in extremely complex output phage pools where a few antibodies are highly abundant and the majority is very rare. This is a huge challenge in the screening where only a fraction of the antibodies can be tested using a conventional binding analysis, identifying mainly the most abundant clones typically binding only one or a few targets. As the expected number of antibodies and specificities in the pool is much higher, complementing methods, to reach deeper into the pool, are required, called deep mining methods. In this study, four deep mining methods were evaluated: 1) isolation of rare sub-pools of specific antibodies through selection on recombinant proteins predicted to be expressed on the target cells, 2) isolation of a sub-pool enriched for antibodies of unknown specificities through depletion of the primary phage pool on recombinant proteins corresponding to receptors known to generate many binders, 3) isolation of a sub-pool enriched for antibodies through selection on cells blocked with antibodies dominating the primary phage pool, and 4) next-generation sequencing-based analysis of isolated antibody pools followed by antibody gene synthesis and production of rare but enriched clones. We demonstrate that antibodies binding new targets and epitopes, not discovered through screening alone, can be discovered using described deep mining methods. Overall, we demonstrate the complexity of phage pools generated through selection on cells and show that a combination of conventional screening and deep mining methods are needed to fully utilize such pools. Deep mining will be important in future phenotypic antibody drug discovery efforts to increase the diversity of identified antibodies and targets."

Herein we developed a procedure to efficiently compare the sequences of large numbers of phage-selected peptides for the purpose of identifying target-binding peptide motifs. We applied the procedure to analyze bicyclic peptides isolated against five different protein targets: sortase A, urokinase-type plasminogen activator, coagulation factor XII, plasma kallikrein and streptavidin. We optimized sequence data filters to reduce biases originating from the sequencing method and developed sequence correction algorithms to prevent identification of false consensus motifs. With our strategy, we were able to identify rare target-binding peptide motifs, as well as to define more precisely consensus sequences and sub-groups of consensus sequences. This information is valuable to choose peptide leads for drug development and it facilitates identification of epitopes. We furthermore show that binding motifs can be identified after a single round of phage selection. Such a selection regimen reduces propagation-related bias and may facilitate application of phage display in non-specialized laboratories, as procedures such as bacterial infection, phage propagation and purification are not required."

We found that next generation sequencing can significantly empower the analysis of antigen-specific libraries by allowing simultaneous processing of dozens of library/serum combinations in less than two days, including the time required for antibody-mediated library selection.

Three chicken immune single-chain variable fragment (scFv) libraries were subjected to bio-panning on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Phagemid DNA prepared from the original libraries as well as from the Escherichia coli pool after each round of bio-panning was analyzed using NGS, and the heavy chain complementarity-determining region 3 (HCDR3) sequences of the scFv clones were determined. Subsequently, through two-step linker PCR and cloning, the entire scFv gene was retrieved and analyzed for its reactivity to PSA in a phage enzyme immunoassay. After four rounds of bio-panning, the conventional colony screening method was performed for comparison. The scFv clones retrieved from NGS analysis included all clones identified by the conventional colony screening method as well as many additional clones. The enrichment of the HCDR3 sequence throughout the bio-panning process was a positive predictive factor for the selection of PSA-reactive scFv clones."

                            "Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have been employed in several phage display platforms for analyzing natural and synthetic antibody sequences and for identifying and reconstructing single-chain variable fragments (scFv) and antigen-binding fragments (Fab) not found by conventional ELISA screens. In this work, we developed an NGS-assisted antibody discovery platform by integrating phage-displayed, single-framework, synthetic Fab libraries. Due to limitations in attainable read and amplicon lengths, NGS analysis of Fab libraries and selection outputs is usually restricted to either VH or VL. Since this information alone is not sufficient for high-throughput reconstruction of Fabs, we developed a rapid and simple method for linking and sequencing all diversified CDRs in phage Fab pools. Our method resulted in a reliable and straightforward platform for converting NGS information into Fab clones. We used our NGS-assisted Fab reconstruction method to recover low-frequency rare clones from phage selection outputs. While previous studies chose rare clones for rescue based on their relative frequencies in sequencing outputs, we chose rare clones for reconstruction from less-frequent CDRH3 lengths. In some cases, reconstructed rare clones (frequency \u223c0.1%) showed higher affinity and better specificity than high-frequency top clones identified by Sanger sequencing, highlighting the significance of NGS-based approaches in synthetic antibody discovery."

                            "Peptide ligands are used to increase the specificity of drug carriers to their target cells and to facilitate intracellular delivery. One method to identify such peptide ligands, phage display, enables high-throughput screening of peptide libraries for ligands binding to therapeutic targets of interest. However, conventional methods for identifying target binders in a library by Sanger sequencing are low-throughput, labor-intensive, and provide a limited perspective (<0.01%) of the complete sequence space. Moreover, the small sample space can be dominated by nonspecific, preferentially amplifying \"parasitic sequences\" and plastic-binding sequences, which may lead to the identification of false positives or exclude the identification of target-binding sequences. To overcome these challenges, we employed next-generation Illumina sequencing to couple high-throughput screening and high-throughput sequencing, enabling more comprehensive access to the phage display library sequence space. In this work, we define the hallmarks of binding sequences in next-generation sequencing data, and develop a method that identifies several target-binding phage clones for murine, alternatively activated M2 macrophages with a high (100%) success rate: sequences and binding motifs were reproducibly present across biological replicates; binding motifs were identified across multiple unique sequences; and an unselected, amplified library accurately filtered out parasitic sequences."

                            "The use of phage-display antibody combinatorial libraries has impulsed the isolation of innovative antibodies. Approximately 30% of the approved antibodies for clinical treatments in the last 5 years were isolated from phage-displayed libraries using different selection strategies. (Grilo et al., 2019) Originally, the validation of selected clones was based on either the enrichment of specific clones throughout the selection rounds (Griffiths et al., 1994) or biological activities of some (few) randomly selected clones. 3 However, the low throughput of Sanger sequencing limited these strategies, as enriched clones were assessed from few sequences, or activityscreened clones (antigen binding, for example). Thirty years after the pioneering work describing the phase-display technique, (Smith, 1985) new methodologies such as next-generation sequencing (NGS) have pushed the technology toward modern standards for selecting biologically active selected clones. \n\nThe development of NGS increased in several orders of magnitude the quantity of individual clone sequences obtained, allowing the determination of complete variable domain repertoires. As a consequence, NGS sequencing became the preferred strategy to determine antibody phage clones that were successfully selected in phage-display experiments. (Rouet et al., 2018) 7](Rosenfeld et al., 2018) Some methods focus on the VH complementarity-determining region-3 (CDR3) to address the diversity of phage libraries. (Maranh\u00e3o et al., 2013)(Ravn et al., 2010) The role of CDR3 in antigen (Ag) recognition and binding is noteworthy, but other regions (CDR1 or 2, and even some framework residues) have also been described as crucial in some antibodyantigen interactions. Thus, novel approaches addressing the whole sequence may be more indicated to find reliable highaffinity antibody domains."

Two peptides were further confirmed to inhibit both E3 ubiquitin ligases, MDM2 and CHIP, and their binding modes were solved by the NMR analysis. Zhao et al. made a phage panning scheme that separately covered selections against phosphotyrosine (pTyr) and sulfated tyrosine (sTyr) peptides, followed by NGS. After mining the NGS data and validating with experiments, they successfully identified some sTyr superbinders.

                "tldr": "Construction of high-quality phage display libraries requires careful consideration of diversity, randomness, and clonal distribution, which has been significantly enhanced by next-generation sequencing technologies. NGS enables comprehensive characterization of library quality, identification of compositional biases, and assessment of diversity metrics that help researchers create more effective libraries for antibody and peptide discovery. (13 sources)",
                "text": "\nThe development and optimization of phage display libraries has been revolutionized by next-generation sequencing technologies, which provide unprecedented insights into library composition, diversity, and quality. NGS analysis has revealed that many commercial and custom-built libraries contain significant compositional biases that can affect selection outcomes. For example, NGS characterization of the widely used Ph.D.-12 peptide library from New England Biolabs demonstrated \"non-random representation of sequences at DNA, amino acid, and peptide levels as well as a high frequency of wild-type clones\" <Paper corpusId=\"253287519\" paperTitle=\"(Sloth et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. Similar analyses of other libraries have identified deviations from randomness, such as UAG codon over-representation and high G phosphoramidite abundance, which introduce amino acid distribution biases <Paper corpusId=\"46744199\" paperTitle=\"(Ryvkin et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nA critical factor in successful phage display library construction is maximizing diversity while maintaining quality. For antibody libraries, this involves careful selection of source material and optimization of cloning strategies. Researchers have demonstrated that using B cells from multiple donors can expand a library's repertoire, providing a broader range of potential binding specificities <Paper corpusId=\"269574517\" paperTitle=\"(Lee et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. Similarly, stimulating B cells with activators like Toll-like receptor agonists before harvesting genetic material can enhance library diversity. In one study, researchers constructed a large human combinatorial single-chain variable fragment library (1.5 \u00d7 10^11 colonies) from Epstein-Barr virus-infected human peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with a combination of TLR7/8 agonist R848 and interleukin-2. NGS analysis of approximately 1.9 \u00d7 10^6 heavy chain variable (VH) and 2.7 \u00d7 10^6 \u03ba light chain variable (V\u03ba) domain sequences revealed high uniqueness (approximately 94% for VH and 91% for V\u03ba) with greater diversity than germline sequences <Paper corpusId=\"257725782\" paperTitle=\"(Choi et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe development of immune libraries, particularly for nanobodies (VHH domains), has also benefited from NGS characterization. Researchers building immune VHH libraries can use NGS to identify specifically enriched sequence clusters following selection, dramatically improving the efficiency of screening for functional binders <Paper corpusId=\"265025941\" paperTitle=\"(Zehnaker et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This approach offers significant advantages over traditional colony picking and Sanger sequencing methods that have been used since the 1990s, which only sample a small fraction of the clones involved in the selection process <Paper corpusId=\"269422804\" paperTitle=\"(Garcia-Calvo et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nOne key technological advancement that has greatly improved phage display library construction is Oligonucleotide Library Synthesis (OLS), which enables high-throughput synthesis of numerous oligonucleotide sequences to create highly diverse peptide libraries. Techniques such as Phage Immunoprecipitation Sequencing (PhIP-Seq) utilize OLS to encode peptide libraries, allowing for efficient large-scale antibody detection through the combination of high-capacity phage display, antibody immunoprecipitation, and high-throughput sequencing <Paper corpusId=\"272411476\" paperTitle=\"(Huang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe integration of in vitro phage display with high-throughput DNA synthesis and sequencing technologies has also facilitated rational approaches to antibody affinity maturation. The vast sequence data generated by Illumina sequencing allows for comprehensive analysis of library clone diversity and abundance, as well as monitoring of selection parameters during the enrichment process <Paper corpusId=\"3155125\" paperTitle=\"(Hu et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>. This integration has transformed our understanding of antibody repertoires and is helping researchers design better libraries with improved distribution of sequence diversity <Paper corpusId=\"28880618\" paperTitle=\"(Georgiou et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nNGS has also improved the efficiency of clone identification from phage selections. Traditional approaches to isolating clones from phage display outputs relied on labor-intensive screening of individual colonies. However, NGS-based approaches now allow for the identification of valuable clones based on sequence frequency, including rare clones that might be missed by traditional screening methods <Paper corpusId=\"32325550\" paperTitle=\"(D'Angelo et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"2900474\" paperTitle=\"(Ravn et al., 2010)\" isShortName></Paper>. Furthermore, NGS enables the identification and reconstruction of complementarity-determining region (CDR) combinations in antibody fragments, providing a more complete picture of the selected antibody repertoire <Paper corpusId=\"73726420\" paperTitle=\"(Barreto et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe comprehensive characterization of phage display libraries through NGS has become an essential tool for assessing library quality, understanding selection dynamics, and optimizing library construction methodologies. As NGS technologies continue to evolve and become more accessible, they will further enhance our ability to create high-quality, diverse phage display libraries for therapeutic and diagnostic applications <Paper corpusId=\"3573710\" paperTitle=\"(Rouet et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>.",

                            "Antibody phage display is a key technology for the discovery and development of target-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for use in research, diagnostics, and therapy. The construction of a high-quality antibody library, with larger and more diverse antibody repertoires, is essential for the successful development of phage display-derived mAbs. In this study, a large human combinatorial single-chain variable fragment library (1.5 \u00d7 1011 colonies) was constructed from Epstein\u2013Barr virus-infected human peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with a combination of two of the activators of human B cells, the Toll-like receptor 7/8 agonist R848 and interleukin-2. Next-generation sequencing analysis with approximately 1.9 \u00d7 106 and 2.7 \u00d7 106 full-length sequences of heavy chain variable (VH) and \u03ba light chain variable (V\u03ba) domains, respectively, revealed that the library consists of unique VH (approximately 94%) and V\u03ba (approximately 91%) sequences with greater diversity than germline sequences."

Information gained from high-throughput DNA sequencing of immunoglobulin genes (Ig-seq) can be applied to detect B-cell malignancies with high sensitivity, to discover antibodies specific for antigens of interest, to guide vaccine development and to understand autoimmunity. Rapid progress in the development of experimental protocols and informatics analysis tools is helping to reduce sequencing artifacts, to achieve more precise quantification of clonal diversity and to extract the most pertinent biological information. That said, broader application of Ig-seq, especially in clinical settings, will require the development of a standardized experimental design framework that will enable the sharing and meta-analysis of sequencing data generated by different laboratories."

                            "The application of deep sequencing to in vitro display technologies has been invaluable for the straightforward analysis of enriched clones. After sequencing in vitro selected populations, clones are binned into identical or similar groups and ordered by abundance, allowing identification of those that are most enriched. However, the greatest strength of deep sequencing is also its greatest weakness: clones are easily identified by their DNA sequences, but are not physically available for testing without a laborious multistep process involving several rounds of polymerization chain reaction (PCR), assembly and cloning. Here, using the isolation of antibody genes from a phage and yeast display selection as an example, we show the power of a rapid and simple inverse PCR-based method to easily isolate clones identified by deep sequencing. Once primers have been received, clone isolation can be carried out in a single day, rather than two days. Furthermore the reduced number of PCRs required will reduce PCR mutations correspondingly. We have observed a 100% success rate in amplifying clones with an abundance as low as 0.5% in a polyclonal population. This approach allows us to obtain full-length clones even when an incomplete sequence is available, and greatly simplifies the subcloning process. Moreover, rarer, but functional clones missed by traditional screening can be easily isolated using this method, and the approach can be extended to any selected library (scFv, cDNA, libraries based on scaffold proteins) where a unique sequence signature for the desired clones of interest is available."

This approach allowed for in depth analysis of the library\u2019s diversity, provided sequence information on virtually all scFv during selection for binding to two targets and a global view of these enrichment processes. Using the most frequent heavy chain CDR3 sequences, primers were designed to rescue scFv from the third selection round. Identification, based on sequence frequency, retrieved the most potent scFv and valuable candidates that were missed using classical in vitro screening. Thus, by combining NGS with display technologies, laborious and time consuming upfront screening can be by-passed or complemented and valuable insights into the selection process can be obtained to improve library design and understanding of antibody repertoires."

                            "Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have been employed in several phage display platforms for analyzing natural and synthetic antibody sequences and for identifying and reconstructing single-chain variable fragments (scFv) and antigen-binding fragments (Fab) not found by conventional ELISA screens. In this work, we developed an NGS-assisted antibody discovery platform by integrating phage-displayed, single-framework, synthetic Fab libraries. Due to limitations in attainable read and amplicon lengths, NGS analysis of Fab libraries and selection outputs is usually restricted to either VH or VL. Since this information alone is not sufficient for high-throughput reconstruction of Fabs, we developed a rapid and simple method for linking and sequencing all diversified CDRs in phage Fab pools. Our method resulted in a reliable and straightforward platform for converting NGS information into Fab clones. We used our NGS-assisted Fab reconstruction method to recover low-frequency rare clones from phage selection outputs. While previous studies chose rare clones for rescue based on their relative frequencies in sequencing outputs, we chose rare clones for reconstruction from less-frequent CDRH3 lengths. In some cases, reconstructed rare clones (frequency \u223c0.1%) showed higher affinity and better specificity than high-frequency top clones identified by Sanger sequencing, highlighting the significance of NGS-based approaches in synthetic antibody discovery."

This approach has been used to analyze the meningococcal NadA virulence factor, enabling researchers to rank hundreds of antigenic fragments according to their immunoreactivity with superior resolution compared to traditional methods. PROFILER allows simultaneous processing of dozens of library/serum combinations in less than two days, significantly accelerating epitope identification for vaccine development. <Paper corpusId=\"15420021\" paperTitle=\"(Domina et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\n- **Identification of rare antibodies from immune libraries**: NGS has proven valuable for identifying rare antibody clones that might be missed by traditional panning methods. In a study with a llama immunized with staphylococcal enterotoxin B, researchers sequenced a single domain antibody (VHH) library, generating approximately 8.5 million sequences. By interrogating this dataset with sequences of known SEB-binding antibodies, they identified and produced new antibodies with comparable affinities and thermal stabilities to those obtained through traditional panning. This demonstrated NGS as a complementary tool to conventional phage display for rapidly obtaining additional antibodies even when they are low in frequency within a library. <Paper corpusId=\"15659069\" paperTitle=\"(Turner et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\n- **Peptide ligand discovery for targeted drug delivery**: NGS has transformed the identification of peptide ligands for targeted drug delivery by providing more comprehensive access to phage display library sequence space. Researchers have developed methods to identify target-binding phage clones with high success rates for specific cell types such as alternatively activated M2 macrophages. These approaches define hallmarks of binding sequences in NGS data, including reproducible presence across biological replicates and identification of binding motifs across multiple unique sequences. This strategy effectively filters out \"parasitic sequences\" that can dominate traditional screening methods, reducing false positives and increasing the likelihood of identifying genuine target-binding sequences. <Paper corpusId=\"21565097\" paperTitle=\"(Liu et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\n- **Enhanced antibody discovery against disease markers**: NGS-based screening of chicken immune single-chain variable fragment (scFv) libraries has proven more effective than conventional methods for identifying antibodies against disease markers like prostate-specific antigen (PSA). By analyzing heavy chain complementarity-determining region 3 (HCDR3) sequences from phage libraries after each round of bio-panning, researchers identified many additional PSA-reactive clones beyond those found through traditional colony screening. The enrichment patterns of HCDR3 sequences throughout the bio-panning process served as positive predictive factors for selecting reactive antibodies. <Paper corpusId=\"2340454\" paperTitle=\"(Yang et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\n- **Identification of inhibitors for protein-protein interactions**: NGS has been applied to identify peptides targeting specific protein interactions with therapeutic potential. Using the Roche 454 NGS platform, researchers identified over 13,000 peptides targeting ubiquitin and over 10,000 peptides against the ubiquitin-like modifier NEDD8 from a phage display peptide library. Further validation confirmed peptides that inhibit E3 ubiquitin ligases MDM2 and CHIP, with binding modes characterized by NMR analysis. <Paper corpusId=\"254248125\" paperTitle=\"(Huang et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\n- **G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) targeting**: NGS-assisted phage display has been successfully applied to target GPCRs, which are important therapeutic targets. In one study, researchers constructed immune VHH libraries and used NGS to identify 34 clusters of specifically enriched sequences against GPCRs. These were functionally assessed using a cAMP response element (CRE)-dependent reporter gene assay, demonstrating the utility of this approach for identifying functional binders to complex membrane proteins. <Paper corpusId=\"265025941\" paperTitle=\"(Zehnaker et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\n- **Large-scale antibody profiling using PhIP-Seq**: Phage Immunoprecipitation Sequencing (PhIP-Seq) combines oligonucleotide library synthesis (OLS), phage display, antibody immunoprecipitation, and high-throughput sequencing to enable efficient large-scale antibody detection. This technique has enhanced the throughput and applicability of phage display for comprehensive antibody profiling, particularly useful for autoimmune disease research and vaccine development. <Paper corpusId=\"272411476\" paperTitle=\"(Huang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\n- **Reconstruction of rare antibody fragments**: NGS-assisted antibody discovery platforms have been developed to integrate phage-displayed, single-framework, synthetic Fab libraries with sequencing technologies. These approaches overcome the read length limitations of NGS by developing methods for linking and sequencing all diversified complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) in phage Fab pools. This enables straightforward conversion of NGS information into functional antibody clones. Notably, reconstructed rare clones with frequencies as low as 0.1% have sometimes shown higher affinity and better specificity than high-frequency clones identified by traditional Sanger sequencing, highlighting the value of NGS-based approaches in synthetic antibody discovery. <Paper corpusId=\"73726420\" paperTitle=\"(Barreto et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>",

                            "Next-Generation Sequencing and bioinformatics are powerful tools for analyzing the large number of DNA sequences present in an immune library. In this work, we constructed a cDNA library of single domain antibodies from a llama immunized with staphylococcal enterotoxin B. The resulting library was sequenced, resulting in approximately 8.5 million sequences with 5.4 million representing intact, useful sequences. The sequenced library was interrogated using sequences of known SEB-binding single domain antibodies from the library obtained through phage display panning methods in a previous study. New antibodies were identified, produced, and characterized, and were shown to have affinities and melting temperatures comparable to those obtained by traditional panning methods. This demonstrates the utility of using NGS as a complementary tool to phage-displayed biopanning as a means for rapidly obtaining additional antibodies from an immune library. It also shows that phage display, using a library of high diversity, is able to select high quality antibodies even when they are low in frequency."

                            "Peptide ligands are used to increase the specificity of drug carriers to their target cells and to facilitate intracellular delivery. One method to identify such peptide ligands, phage display, enables high-throughput screening of peptide libraries for ligands binding to therapeutic targets of interest. However, conventional methods for identifying target binders in a library by Sanger sequencing are low-throughput, labor-intensive, and provide a limited perspective (<0.01%) of the complete sequence space. Moreover, the small sample space can be dominated by nonspecific, preferentially amplifying \"parasitic sequences\" and plastic-binding sequences, which may lead to the identification of false positives or exclude the identification of target-binding sequences. To overcome these challenges, we employed next-generation Illumina sequencing to couple high-throughput screening and high-throughput sequencing, enabling more comprehensive access to the phage display library sequence space. In this work, we define the hallmarks of binding sequences in next-generation sequencing data, and develop a method that identifies several target-binding phage clones for murine, alternatively activated M2 macrophages with a high (100%) success rate: sequences and binding motifs were reproducibly present across biological replicates; binding motifs were identified across multiple unique sequences; and an unselected, amplified library accurately filtered out parasitic sequences."

Three chicken immune single-chain variable fragment (scFv) libraries were subjected to bio-panning on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Phagemid DNA prepared from the original libraries as well as from the Escherichia coli pool after each round of bio-panning was analyzed using NGS, and the heavy chain complementarity-determining region 3 (HCDR3) sequences of the scFv clones were determined. Subsequently, through two-step linker PCR and cloning, the entire scFv gene was retrieved and analyzed for its reactivity to PSA in a phage enzyme immunoassay. After four rounds of bio-panning, the conventional colony screening method was performed for comparison. The scFv clones retrieved from NGS analysis included all clones identified by the conventional colony screening method as well as many additional clones. The enrichment of the HCDR3 sequence throughout the bio-panning process was a positive predictive factor for the selection of PSA-reactive scFv clones."

                            "Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have been employed in several phage display platforms for analyzing natural and synthetic antibody sequences and for identifying and reconstructing single-chain variable fragments (scFv) and antigen-binding fragments (Fab) not found by conventional ELISA screens. In this work, we developed an NGS-assisted antibody discovery platform by integrating phage-displayed, single-framework, synthetic Fab libraries. Due to limitations in attainable read and amplicon lengths, NGS analysis of Fab libraries and selection outputs is usually restricted to either VH or VL. Since this information alone is not sufficient for high-throughput reconstruction of Fabs, we developed a rapid and simple method for linking and sequencing all diversified CDRs in phage Fab pools. Our method resulted in a reliable and straightforward platform for converting NGS information into Fab clones. We used our NGS-assisted Fab reconstruction method to recover low-frequency rare clones from phage selection outputs. While previous studies chose rare clones for rescue based on their relative frequencies in sequencing outputs, we chose rare clones for reconstruction from less-frequent CDRH3 lengths. In some cases, reconstructed rare clones (frequency \u223c0.1%) showed higher affinity and better specificity than high-frequency top clones identified by Sanger sequencing, highlighting the significance of NGS-based approaches in synthetic antibody discovery."

                "title": "Limitations and Future Directions",
                "tldr": "Despite significant advancements, phage display with NGS still faces limitations including technical challenges with library sequencing, bioinformatic bottlenecks, and recovery of rare clones. Future developments are focusing on addressing these limitations through improved long-read technologies, better computational tools, and novel approaches to retrieving rare binders. (6 sources)",
                "text": "\nWhile the integration of next-generation sequencing with phage display has revolutionized antibody discovery, several important limitations persist that researchers are actively working to overcome. One of the most significant challenges has been the read length limitations of second-generation sequencing technologies. As Nannini and colleagues note, \"the current NGS methods employed for sequencing phage display libraries are limited by the short contiguous read lengths associated with second-generation sequencing platforms. Consequently, the identification of antibody sequences has conventionally been restricted to individual antibody domains or to the analysis of single domain binding moieties\" <Paper corpusId=\"229940603\" paperTitle=\"(Nannini et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. This limitation has traditionally forced researchers to sequence only portions of antibody fragments, making the reconstruction of complete antibodies challenging.\n\nAlthough third-generation sequencing technologies like Pacific Biosciences SMRT sequencing and Oxford Nanopore have begun to address these read length constraints, they introduce their own challenges related to error rates, throughput, and cost. Nannini and colleagues demonstrated that SMRT sequencing coupled with hairpin adaptor loop ligation can facilitate \"accurate interrogation of full-length single-chain Fv (scFv) libraries\" <Paper corpusId=\"229940603\" paperTitle=\"(Nannini et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. However, these approaches are still evolving and have not yet fully replaced shorter-read technologies for all applications.\n\nAnother major limitation involves the physical recovery of valuable clones identified through NGS analysis. Zambrano and colleagues highlight that \"to physically fish out in silico-identified clones of interest, a laborious recovery step is necessary\" <Paper corpusId=\"247312322\" paperTitle=\"(Zambrano et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. This recovery challenge is particularly acute when dealing with rare binders that may have superior properties but exist at very low frequencies within the library. The process of reconstructing these clones from sequence data remains time-consuming and resource-intensive, creating a bottleneck in the antibody discovery pipeline.\n\nThe complexity of phage output pools presents additional challenges. As observed in phenotypic discovery approaches, \"Clonal expansion throughout the phage display enrichment process is affected by multiple factors resulting in extremely complex output phage pools where a few antibodies are highly abundant and the majority is very rare\" <Paper corpusId=\"247312322\" paperTitle=\"(Zambrano et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"198963158\" paperTitle=\"(Ljungars et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. This complexity necessitates complementary \"deep mining\" methods to identify valuable rare clones that might otherwise be overlooked.\n\nBioinformatic analysis of NGS data from phage display libraries also presents significant challenges. The vast amounts of sequence data generated require sophisticated computational approaches to effectively cluster related sequences, identify enrichment patterns, and distinguish genuine binders from background or target-unrelated peptides <Paper corpusId=\"247312322\" paperTitle=\"(Zambrano et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"19585528\" paperTitle=\"(Vodnik et al., 2011)\" isShortName></Paper>. As libraries become larger and more diverse, these computational challenges will continue to grow, requiring more advanced algorithms and increased computing resources.\n\nLooking toward the future, several promising directions are emerging to address these limitations. The continued development of long-read sequencing technologies is expected to further improve the ability to characterize full-length antibody constructs. Wei and colleagues suggest that \"characterization of full length VH-VL constructs using synthetic long read assemblies of short read next-generation sequencing data has emerged as a powerful approach to identify antibody candidates with greater speed and sensitivity than classical screening methods\" <Paper corpusId=\"248754302\" paperTitle=\"(Wei et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. These synthetic long-read approaches may offer a compromise between the throughput advantages of short-read technologies and the length benefits of third-generation platforms.\n\nAdvances in bioinformatics tools tailored specifically for antibody discovery are also expected to address computational bottlenecks. These tools will likely incorporate machine learning approaches to better predict binding properties from sequence data, potentially reducing the need for extensive experimental validation of all candidate binders <Paper corpusId=\"272630189\" paperTitle=\"(Cui et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nNew deep mining strategies are being developed to more effectively identify rare but valuable binders from complex phage pools. These include techniques such as depletion of dominant binders, blocking of known epitopes during selection, and targeted enrichment of specific subpopulations <Paper corpusId=\"247312322\" paperTitle=\"(Zambrano et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"198963158\" paperTitle=\"(Ljungars et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. Such approaches may help to overcome the bias toward abundant clones that often occurs in traditional screening methods.\n\nIntegration of multiple technological platforms is another promising direction. The combination of phage display with other display technologies (such as yeast or bacterial display), along with complementary screening methods like flow cytometry, may provide more comprehensive coverage of the potential binding space <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">.\n\nThe future of phage display will likely involve increasingly sophisticated library designs informed by structural biology and computational modeling. These approaches may help to create more focused libraries with greater functional diversity, potentially addressing some of the biases observed in current libraries <Paper corpusId=\"272630189\" paperTitle=\"(Cui et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. Additionally, the integration of NGS data with other omics approaches, such as proteomics and structural data, may provide deeper insights into antibody-antigen interactions and guide more efficient library design and screening strategies <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">.\n\nAs these technological advances continue to mature, phage display combined with NGS is poised to play an increasingly important role in therapeutic antibody discovery, vaccine development, and basic research into protein-protein interactions. The field is moving toward more efficient, less labor-intensive approaches that can identify higher-quality binders with greater specificity and improved functional properties.",

Based on this concept, NGS was adopted for the screening of antibody libraries to identify potential binders by monitoring the enrichment of a given sequence during the selection cycles (Yang et al., 2017). Parallel comparative screenings of antibody libraries by traditional ELISA and NGS have demonstrated that, beyond top-ranking clones efficiently identified by both technologies, deep sequencing enables the discovery of many more specific binders among rare clones with potentially interesting features [38](Ljungars et al., 2019)",

                            "Phage display technology is a common approach for discovery of therapeutic antibodies. Drug candidates are typically isolated in two steps: First, a pool of antibodies is enriched through consecutive rounds of selection on a target antigen, and then individual clones are characterized in a screening procedure. When whole cells are used as targets, as in phenotypic discovery, the output phage pool typically contains thousands of antibodies, binding, in theory, hundreds of different cell surface receptors. Clonal expansion throughout the phage display enrichment process is affected by multiple factors resulting in extremely complex output phage pools where a few antibodies are highly abundant and the majority is very rare. This is a huge challenge in the screening where only a fraction of the antibodies can be tested using a conventional binding analysis, identifying mainly the most abundant clones typically binding only one or a few targets. As the expected number of antibodies and specificities in the pool is much higher, complementing methods, to reach deeper into the pool, are required, called deep mining methods. In this study, four deep mining methods were evaluated: 1) isolation of rare sub-pools of specific antibodies through selection on recombinant proteins predicted to be expressed on the target cells, 2) isolation of a sub-pool enriched for antibodies of unknown specificities through depletion of the primary phage pool on recombinant proteins corresponding to receptors known to generate many binders, 3) isolation of a sub-pool enriched for antibodies through selection on cells blocked with antibodies dominating the primary phage pool, and 4) next-generation sequencing-based analysis of isolated antibody pools followed by antibody gene synthesis and production of rare but enriched clones. We demonstrate that antibodies binding new targets and epitopes, not discovered through screening alone, can be discovered using described deep mining methods. Overall, we demonstrate the complexity of phage pools generated through selection on cells and show that a combination of conventional screening and deep mining methods are needed to fully utilize such pools. Deep mining will be important in future phenotypic antibody drug discovery efforts to increase the diversity of identified antibodies and targets."

                            "An increasing number of peptides with specific binding affinity to various protein and even non-protein targets are being discovered from phage display libraries. The power of this method lies in its ability to efficiently and rapidly identify ligands with a desired target property from a large population of phage clones displaying diverse surface peptides. However, the search for the needle in the haystack does not always end successfully. False positive results may appear. Thus instead of specific binders phage with no actual affinity toward the target are recovered due to their propagation advantages or binding to other components of the screening system, such as the solid phase, capturing reagents, contaminants in the target sample or blocking agents, rather than the target. Biopanning experiments on different targets performed in our laboratory revealed some previously identified and many new target-unrelated peptide sequences, which have already been frequently described and published, but not yet recognized as target-unrelated. Distinguishing true binders from false positives is an important step toward phage display selections of greater integrity. This article thoroughly reviews and discusses already identified and new target-unrelated peptides and suggests strategies to avoid their isolation."
