                    "text": "The direct detection of Ag85 in patient serum has been proposed as an effective diagnostic for TB [14,15]. This requires stable specific high affinity antibodies, which to date have been either polyclonal [15,31] or monoclonal [14,15,32], obtained by immunization. More recently, methods to generate antibodies using in vitro methods, such as phage and yeast display, have been developed. These have significant advantages over traditional immunization, including the speed with which antibodies can be selected and the ability to screen many more clones for highly specific properties. More significantly, once selected, it is relatively straightforward to improve many antibody properties such as: a) affinity [33,34]; b) specificity, [35,36]; and c) expression levels [37,38]. In this paper, we have combined the two most powerful in vitro antibody selection platforms (phage and yeast display) to select a large number of antibodies against Ag85. This panel comprises a far greater antibody variety than usually obtained when carrying out phage display alone, significantly increasing the number of available anti-Ag85 antibodies. We believe this is due to the more efficient harvesting of the available antibody diversity. Depending upon the efforts expended in creating them, na\u0131 \u00a8ve antibody libraries have enormous diversity (.10 9 different clones) [20,22,39,40]. Theoretical [41] and practical [42,43] studies have shown that, depending upon the desired affinity, a library size of ,10 7 clones should yield approximately one specific antibody, and that the number of selected antibodies should increase proportionally with library size. However, this has not been the case with phage display, where, unless especially heroic efforts are made [44], only 5-30 different specific antibodies are usually selected from large libraries. This is likely due to additional biases occurring during phage display selection [45] that do not appear to occur in yeast display [20], probably because expression control is tighter. \n\nThis combination of technologies exploits the advantages of each of the two platforms. After carrying out one to two rounds of selection in phage, the diversity is reduced from 10 9-11 to 10 5-6 .",

During infection a number of bacterial molecules that play a role in the infective process are released and have been proposed as biomarkers for early TB diagnosis. Antigen 85 (Ag85) is the most abundant secreted TB protein, and a potential target for this diagnostic approach. One of the bottlenecks in the direct detection of such bacterial targets is the availability of robust, sensitive, specific antibodies. Methods Using Ag85 as a model, we describe a method to select antibodies against any potential target using a novel combination of phage and yeast display that exploits the advantage of each approach. Results The efficiency of this approach was attested to by the 111 specific antibodies identified in initial screens. These were assessed for binding to the different Ag85 subunits, affinity, and activity in sandwich assays. Conclusions The novelty of this approach lies in the possibility of screening the entire output of a phage antibody selection in a single experiment by yeast display. This can be considered analogous to carrying out a million ELISAs. The monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) identified in this way show high binding affinity and selectivity for the antigens and offer an advantage over traditional mAbs produced by relatively expensive and time consuming techniques. This approach has wide applicability, and the affinity of selected antibodies can be significantly improved, if required.\n## Discussion\nThe direct detection of Ag85 in patient serum has been proposed as an effective diagnostic for TB [14,15]. This requires stable specific high affinity antibodies, which to date have been either polyclonal [15,31] or monoclonal [14,15,32], obtained by immunization. More recently, methods to generate antibodies using in vitro methods, such as phage and yeast display, have been developed. These have significant advantages over traditional immunization, including the speed with which antibodies can be selected and the ability to screen many more clones for highly specific properties. More significantly, once selected, it is relatively straightforward to improve many antibody properties such as: a) affinity [33,34]; b) specificity, [35,36]; and c) expression levels [37,38]. In this paper, we have combined the two most powerful in vitro antibody selection platforms (phage and yeast display) to select a large number of antibodies against Ag85. This panel comprises a far greater antibody variety than usually obtained when carrying out phage display alone, significantly increasing the number of available anti-Ag85 antibodies. We believe this is due to the more efficient harvesting of the available antibody diversity. Depending upon the efforts expended in creating them, na\u0131 \u00a8ve antibody libraries have enormous diversity (.10 9 different clones) [20,22,39,40]. Theoretical [41] and practical [42,43] studies have shown that, depending upon the desired affinity, a library size of ,10 7 clones should yield approximately one specific antibody, and that the number of selected antibodies should increase proportionally with library size. However, this has not been the case with phage display, where, unless especially heroic efforts are made [44], only 5-30 different specific antibodies are usually selected from large libraries. This is likely due to additional biases occurring during phage display selection [45] that do not appear to occur in yeast display [20], probably because expression control is tighter. \n\nThis combination of technologies exploits the advantages of each of the two platforms. After carrying out one to two rounds of selection in phage, the diversity is reduced from 10 9-11 to 10 5-6 .",

Multifunctional phage display technology has enabled the development of versatile biosensors based on M13 phage for detection and analysis. Through surface modifications, M13 phage gains new characteristics, such as targeted binding ability, optical properties of quantum dots, and the accumulation of magnetic nanoparticles (171). These modifications make M13 phage an ideal platform for highly sensitive and selective biosensor development in cholera toxins detection, offering improved accuracy and efficiency. In contrast to random peptides, recombinant antibodies possess the advantage of direct fixation on both solid surfaces and antigens. Isolated from libraries, recombinant antibodies like scFvs and anti-idiotype antibodies find applications in sensitive diagnosis techniques such as ELISA, PD-IPCR, and iLAMP. Additionally, recombinant antibodies expand the scope of immunoassay agents, allowing for the detection of diverse biotoxins within the same group. The use of recombinant antibodies has led to simultaneous biotoxin detection based on phage display, showcasing their advantages, including enhanced specificity, increased sensitivity, shorter detection time, and improved safety. Recombinant antibodies represent a potent tool for the sensitive and specific detection of cholera toxins. In the quest for cholera toxin screening, researchers harnessed diverse resources, including antigens for antibody preparation, proteins, and antibody samples for immunomolecular sieving. Antigens, derived from animals, triggered immune responses, resulting in specific antibodies. To enhance affinity, an animal immune repository was utilized, spotlighting antibodies finely tuned to the toxin. Nanobodies, from animals like camels, featured compact size, stability, and genetic manipulability, becoming potent alternatives to conventional antibodies. Nanobodies played crucial roles, particularly in targeted antibody selection, mimicking toxin epitopes for precise immune analyses, thus serving as high-affinity substitutes. This integrated approach supported effective cholera toxin detection and analysis (172).",

The imperative to safeguard water sources and food from Vibrio cholerae, the causative pathogen, remains urgent. The bacterium is mainly disseminated via ingestion of contaminated water or food. Despite the plate method\u2019s gold standard status for detection, its time-consuming nature, taking several days to provide results, remains a challenge. The emergence of novel virulence serotypes raises public health concerns, potentially compromising existing detection methods. Hence, exploiting Vibrio cholerae toxin testing holds promise due to its inherent stability. Immunobiosensors, leveraging antibody specificity and sensitivity, present formidable tools for detecting diverse small molecules, encompassing drugs, hormones, toxins, and environmental pollutants. This review explores cholera toxin detection, highlighting phage display-based nano immunosensors\u2019 potential. Engineered bacteriophages exhibit exceptional cholera toxin affinity, through specific antibody fragments or mimotopes, enabling precise quantification. This innovative approach promises to reshape cholera toxin detection, offering an alternative to animal-derived methods. Harnessing engineered bacteriophages aligns with ethical detection and emphasizes sensitivity and accuracy, a pivotal stride in the evolution of detection strategies. This review primarily introduces recent advancements in phage display-based nano immunosensors for cholera toxin, encompassing technical aspects, current challenges, and future prospects.\n## Summary\nImmunoassays play a crucial role in rapidly screening biotoxin residues in the environment for human health protection.

Multifunctional phage display technology has enabled the development of versatile biosensors based on M13 phage for detection and analysis. Through surface modifications, M13 phage gains new characteristics, such as targeted binding ability, optical properties of quantum dots, and the accumulation of magnetic nanoparticles (171). These modifications make M13 phage an ideal platform for highly sensitive and selective biosensor development in cholera toxins detection, offering improved accuracy and efficiency. In contrast to random peptides, recombinant antibodies possess the advantage of direct fixation on both solid surfaces and antigens. Isolated from libraries, recombinant antibodies like scFvs and anti-idiotype antibodies find applications in sensitive diagnosis techniques such as ELISA, PD-IPCR, and iLAMP. Additionally, recombinant antibodies expand the scope of immunoassay agents, allowing for the detection of diverse biotoxins within the same group. The use of recombinant antibodies has led to simultaneous biotoxin detection based on phage display, showcasing their advantages, including enhanced specificity, increased sensitivity, shorter detection time, and improved safety. Recombinant antibodies represent a potent tool for the sensitive and specific detection of cholera toxins. In the quest for cholera toxin screening, researchers harnessed diverse resources, including antigens for antibody preparation, proteins, and antibody samples for immunomolecular sieving. Antigens, derived from animals, triggered immune responses, resulting in specific antibodies. To enhance affinity, an animal immune repository was utilized, spotlighting antibodies finely tuned to the toxin. Nanobodies, from animals like camels, featured compact size, stability, and genetic manipulability, becoming potent alternatives to conventional antibodies. Nanobodies played crucial roles, particularly in targeted antibody selection, mimicking toxin epitopes for precise immune analyses, thus serving as high-affinity substitutes. This integrated approach supported effective cholera toxin detection and analysis (172).",

Nine phage-displayed nanobodies specifically to Cry2A were obtained from a naive nanobody library after four rounds of biopanning. The phage-displayed nanobody P2 with high affinity binding was selected as the detection antibody for the sensitive DAS-CLIA development. The proposed method exhibited high sensitivity with a limit of detection of 0.09\u2005ng/mL, has a wide linear range for Cry2A toxin detection, in the range of 0.1\u20131000\u2005ng/mL and negligible cross-reactivities to the other Bt toxins. The recoveries of Cry2A toxin spiked in cereal samples (rice, wheat, and corn) ranged from 82.7% to 118%, with a coefficient of variation of less than 10%. This study demonstrated that the DAS-CLIA procedure based on phage-displayed nanobodies may provide an alternative sensitive method for the detection of Bt toxins in agri-products.

Compared with conventional antibodies, nanobodies have high stability, high affinity, the advantages of easy to produce, and can recognize inaccessible epitopes (Shu et al., 2019;Zhu et al., 2015). Moreover, phage-displayed nanobodies can provide an advantage over the soluble nanobodies being used as reporter elements for immunoassays development. For example, M13 phage particles contain approximately 2700 copies of pVIII capsid protein per phage. This can be used for signal amplification and modification (Goldman et al., 2009;Peltomaa, Lopez-Perolio, Benito-Pena, Barderas, & Moreno-Bondi, 2016). So, phage-displayed nanobodies could be valuable reagents for immunoassay development. \n\nIn this study, specific phage-displayed nanobodies against Cry2A were isolated from a naive nanobody library. Using these phage-displayed nanobodies as the detection antibody, a sensitive double antibody sandwich chemiluminescent immunoassay (DAS-CLIA) was established for the detection of Cry2A toxin. Method validation has been conducted with spiked cereal samples. The proposed phage-displayed nanobodies based DAS-CLIA can provide an alternative approach for the determination of Bt Cry toxins offering a number of advantages including an unlimited supply of uniform reagent.",

Hammock, Xianjin Liu, Rongfa Guan, Cunzheng Zhang\n## Abstract\nABSTRACT In this study, we developed a double antibody sandwich chemiluminescent immunoassay (DAS-CLIA) based on phage-displayed nanobodies for the determination of Cry2A toxin. Nine phage-displayed nanobodies specifically to Cry2A were obtained from a naive nanobody library after four rounds of biopanning. The phage-displayed nanobody P2 with high affinity binding was selected as the detection antibody for the sensitive DAS-CLIA development. The proposed method exhibited high sensitivity with a limit of detection of 0.09\u2005ng/mL, has a wide linear range for Cry2A toxin detection, in the range of 0.1\u20131000\u2005ng/mL and negligible cross-reactivities to the other Bt toxins. The recoveries of Cry2A toxin spiked in cereal samples (rice, wheat, and corn) ranged from 82.7% to 118%, with a coefficient of variation of less than 10%. This study demonstrated that the DAS-CLIA procedure based on phage-displayed nanobodies may provide an alternative sensitive method for the detection of Bt toxins in agri-products. GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n## Introduction\nHowever, the preparation of traditional monoclonal antibody need a complicated procedure, and the single-chain antibody usually exhibited a lower affinity. \n\nNanobodies provide an alternative reagent for the development of ELISA for Cry toxins, the smallest functional antigen-binding unit, are derived from heavy-chain antibodies of camelid (De Genst et al., 2006;Hamers-Casterman et al., 1993). Compared with conventional antibodies, nanobodies have high stability, high affinity, the advantages of easy to produce, and can recognize inaccessible epitopes (Shu et al., 2019;Zhu et al., 2015). Moreover, phage-displayed nanobodies can provide an advantage over the soluble nanobodies being used as reporter elements for immunoassays development. For example, M13 phage particles contain approximately 2700 copies of pVIII capsid protein per phage. This can be used for signal amplification and modification (Goldman et al., 2009;Peltomaa, Lopez-Perolio, Benito-Pena, Barderas, & Moreno-Bondi, 2016). So, phage-displayed nanobodies could be valuable reagents for immunoassay development. \n\nIn this study, specific phage-displayed nanobodies against Cry2A were isolated from a naive nanobody library. Using these phage-displayed nanobodies as the detection antibody, a sensitive double antibody sandwich chemiluminescent immunoassay (DAS-CLIA) was established for the detection of Cry2A toxin. Method validation has been conducted with spiked cereal samples. The proposed phage-displayed nanobodies based DAS-CLIA can provide an alternative approach for the determination of Bt Cry toxins offering a number of advantages including an unlimited supply of uniform reagent.\n\n## Assay validation\nNanobodies derived from camelid heavy-chain antibodies, are the smallest intact antigen binding fragments with high affinity, stability, solubility and contain a long CDR3 loop, which have access to the clefts and cavities of target proteins. With these unique features, nanobody-based approaches are becoming promising tools for diagnostic applications (Li et al., 2014). \n\nWhen compared with the traditional antibodies or soluble nanobodies, phage-displayed nanobodies have the advantages of ease of production, reproducibility and lowcost. Besides, M13 filamentous phages, which have \u223c2700 copies of the 5 kD major pVIII coat protein, can provide great signal amplification when using reporter-conjugated anti-M13 pVIII antibodies. Various studies have shown that M13 phages are valuable reporter elements for use in ELISAs (Goldman, Anderson, Bernstein, & Swain, 2010). In addition, for increasing sensitivity, chemiluminescence has been employed to combine phage-displayed nanobodies, HRP-conjugated anti-M13 pVIII antibodies and chemiluminescent substrates. In further studies, phages could be directly conjugated to a fluorescent dye or other label to improve the detection sensitivity and shorten the procedure.

On the other hand, lateral flow assays incorporate the epitopes conjugated to labels (e.g., gold nanoparticles) that enable visual detection of the target pathogen specific IgG and IgM antibodies in patient samples. \n\nMoreover, the utilization of phage display technology allows for the identification of epitopes that are conserved among different strains of a pathogen.

By incorporating epitopes of a pathogen into diagnostic assays, the accuracy and efficiency of pathogen detection and identification are significantly enhanced. \n\nThese diagnostic assays provide crucial information to healthcare professionals, empowering them to make timely decisions regarding patient management and treatment strategies.

The purpose of this study has been to highlight an approach that encompasses the entire process from epitope identification to vaccine production using a single technique, without requiring additional manipulation. Unlike conventional methods, phage display demonstrates exceptional efficiency and speed, which could provide significant advantages in critical scenarios such as pandemics.\n## Diagnostic Test Development\nThe epitopes of a pathogen have significant potential in the development of diagnostic tests, such as ELISAs or lateral flow assays, to improve their accuracy and efficiency. ELISAs employ these epitopes as capture antigens immobilized on a solid surface, allowing for the detection and quantification of specific antibodies present in patient samples. On the other hand, lateral flow assays incorporate the epitopes conjugated to labels (e.g., gold nanoparticles) that enable visual detection of the target pathogen specific IgG and IgM antibodies in patient samples. \n\nMoreover, the utilization of phage display technology allows for the identification of epitopes that are conserved among different strains of a pathogen. This aspect is particularly valuable for developing diagnostic tests capable of detecting a wide range of pathogen variants [56]. By incorporating epitopes of a pathogen into diagnostic assays, the accuracy and efficiency of pathogen detection and identification are significantly enhanced. \n\nThese diagnostic assays provide crucial information to healthcare professionals, empowering them to make timely decisions regarding patient management and treatment strategies. The incorporation of pathogenic epitopes into these tests ultimately contributes to improved patient care and outcomes.",

The risk of pathogenicity, together with the capacity for constant mutation, emphasizes the need for measures to rapidly detect viruses. The need for highly sensitive bioanalytical methods to diagnose and monitor socially significant viral diseases has increased in the past few years. This is due, on the one hand, to the increased incidence of viral diseases in general (including the unprecedented spread of a new coronavirus infection, SARS-CoV-2), and, on the other hand, to the need to overcome the limitations of modern biomedical diagnostic methods. Phage display technology antibodies as nano-bio-engineered macromolecules can be used for sensor-based virus detection. This review analyzes the commonly used virus detection methods and approaches and shows the prospects for the use of antibodies prepared by phage display technology as sensing elements for sensor-based virus detection.",

                    "text": "The selection of antibody fragments from phage display libraries thus offers the potential to access very large numbers of molecules with different binding specificities quickly and cheaply, avoiding the need for animal immunizations. The scFv can be genetically engineered to produce tailored constructs as described above. Such phage antibodies can be coated directly onto metal, plastic, silica or carbon surfaces by simple adsorption, which, as discussed above, is adequate for biosensor-based assays. \n\nViruses are pervasive life forms that need a host to reproduce. From bacteria to plants and animals to viruses, a wide variety of organisms may become infected. The genome, which is represented by double-or single-stranded DNA or RNA, and the capsid are the two primary structural parts of viruses. A small number of proteins encoded by the viral genome are present in numerous copies to create the extremely symmetrical capsid [216]. Methods for virus detection are employed in contemporary virological research for a variety of applications. They can be used in epidemiology to track and manage pandemic outbreaks of illnesses caused by viruses, including swine flu, SARS-CoV-2, and many others. Diagnostic virus detection methods are central in controlling the spread of viruses and help contain viral infections. Despite its drawbacks, the use of PCR to identify particular viral genomic sequences while an infection is still active is still regarded as the best virus detection technique. However, sensor technologies using phage antibodies as sensitive elements are very promising because antibodies generated by phage display are an excellent alternative to classical antibodies. Since its development in 1985, phage display has been a crucial and successful molecular biology technique that has remained essential for the scientific community. A phage library may include millions, or perhaps billions, of distinct and distinctive mapping peptide ligands because a huge number of nucleotide fragments can be cloned into the phage genome. The epitope mapping and antigen presentation on the bacteriophage surface, which constitute the basis for phage display, have been exploited in affinity selection-based biopanning to screen for potential novel vaccine candidates [77]. \n\nPhage display is a powerful tool for target ligand selection owing to its being simple, highly effective, rapid, and cheap.",

Efficient biopanning selection leads to the isolation of ligands with unique, specific, and desired functional characteristics. Phage antibody display offers multiple platforms for the use of antigen-binding; however, the diversity and stability of the library still need to be improved. \n\nIn the past few years, the need for highly sensitive bioanalytical methods to diagnose and monitor socially significant diseases has increased. This is due, on the one hand, to the growth of the disease in general, including the unprecedented spread of the new coronavirus infection, SARS-CoV-2, and, on the other hand, to the need to overcome the limitations of current biomedical diagnostic methods. For example, because of puncture invasiveness, a tissue biopsy cannot always be performed, and the results of a single biopsy often cannot provide sufficient information in real-time to diagnose the disease. PCR is currently one of the most popular tools for the rapid detection of viral infections. Nucleic acid-based virus detection usually provides high sensitivity but may require trained personnel and be time-consuming and expensive. The use of isothermal amplification systems may reduce equipment costs, making these systems indispensable when highperformance and rapid cycling testing are required. Alternatives to PCR are immunoassays, which offer reliability and cost-effectiveness. In addition, some immunoassays can be modified with lateral flow technology, which greatly speeds up the generation of results. However, immunoassays are usually inferior in sensitivity to PCR. Along with these methods, the use of next-generation sequencing can provide promising results. In addition, the ability to sequence a large number of viral genomes will provide researchers with expanded information about them and will help in tracing infections. \n\nCharacteristics such as high throughput, ease of use, and short running time play an important part, especially in viral outbreaks, in addition to the general requirement for the accuracy, validity, and specificity of viral assays. This strategy enables simple, cheap, rapid, and sensitive detection of specific pathogens, which shows great potential in virus analysis in situ.",

In order to recognize lethal viruses such as Zika, Ebola, Hendra, Nipah, Hanta, Middle East respiratory disease (MERS), and SARS, phage display has been utilized to create new diagnostic tools [76,77]. In the current situation of the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers actively search for neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 for therapeutic use. Because phage display is an important antibody selection method, the prospects for the use of phage display, with special emphasis on its use in the diagnosis and therapy of coronavirus diseases, were shown by Anand et al. [77]. \n\nBy now, a huge pool of antibodies against various viruses has been obtained by phage display, by using na\u00efve or immune libraries. From na\u00efve antibody gene libraries, antibodies against human pathogenic viruses such as SARS coronavirus, dengue virus, influenza virus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, norovirus, and hepatitis C virus have been developed by using recombinant viral proteins or complete viral particles [78,79]. Other antibodies have been chosen from immune antibody gene libraries that target the influenza virus, HIV, SARS coronavirus, yellow fever virus, and Western equine encephalitis virus [79]. Even semisynthetic libraries have been utilized to prepare antibodies specific to the influenza virus [80]. In the past, libraries from several species have been used to successfully isolate virus-specific antibodies. \n\nBy using phage display, potential therapeutic agents are being developed for other human coronaviruses, such as SARS [81] and MERS [82], and for animal coronaviruses, such as infectious bronchitis virus, TGEV, and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus. Highaffinity/small-molecule antibodies have been identified for the E, N, and S proteins of SARS-CoV [77]. For example, Ubah and Palliyil [83] described the advantages of phage antibodies and the prospects for their use against various viral targets.",

Guliy, S. Evstigneeva, V. Khanadeev, L. Dykman\n## Abstract\nViruses are widespread in the environment, and many of them are major pathogens of serious plant, animal, and human diseases. The risk of pathogenicity, together with the capacity for constant mutation, emphasizes the need for measures to rapidly detect viruses. The need for highly sensitive bioanalytical methods to diagnose and monitor socially significant viral diseases has increased in the past few years. This is due, on the one hand, to the increased incidence of viral diseases in general (including the unprecedented spread of a new coronavirus infection, SARS-CoV-2), and, on the other hand, to the need to overcome the limitations of modern biomedical diagnostic methods. Phage display technology antibodies as nano-bio-engineered macromolecules can be used for sensor-based virus detection. This review analyzes the commonly used virus detection methods and approaches and shows the prospects for the use of antibodies prepared by phage display technology as sensing elements for sensor-based virus detection.\n## Introduction\nA major reason for the high prevalence of viral diseases is the lack of effective methods of their detection, including preventive detection in the absence of visible disease symptoms. Therefore, there is a growing need to develop highly sensitive and selective virus detection methods that would be suitable for a wide range of applications, including disease diagnosis, pharmaceutical research, agriculture, and preventive measures. \n\nWe describe the advantages of phage display technology in the production of virusspecific antibodies, and we review what is known about virus detection with phage antibodies used in standard and sensor-based methods.\n\n## Phage Antibodies for Virus Detection/Identification\nPhage display technology antibodies as nano-bio-engineered macromolecules can be used for sensor-based virus detection. In order to recognize lethal viruses such as Zika, Ebola, Hendra, Nipah, Hanta, Middle East respiratory disease (MERS), and SARS, phage display has been utilized to create new diagnostic tools [76,77]. In the current situation of the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers actively search for neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 for therapeutic use. Because phage display is an important antibody selection method, the prospects for the use of phage display, with special emphasis on its use in the diagnosis and therapy of coronavirus diseases, were shown by Anand et al. [77]. \n\nBy now, a huge pool of antibodies against various viruses has been obtained by phage display, by using na\u00efve or immune libraries. From na\u00efve antibody gene libraries, antibodies against human pathogenic viruses such as SARS coronavirus, dengue virus, influenza virus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, norovirus, and hepatitis C virus have been developed by using recombinant viral proteins or complete viral particles [78,79]. Other antibodies have been chosen from immune antibody gene libraries that target the influenza virus, HIV, SARS coronavirus, yellow fever virus, and Western equine encephalitis virus [79]. Even semisynthetic libraries have been utilized to prepare antibodies specific to the influenza virus [80]. In the past, libraries from several species have been used to successfully isolate virus-specific antibodies. \n\nBy using phage display, potential therapeutic agents are being developed for other human coronaviruses, such as SARS [81] and MERS [82], and for animal coronaviruses, such as infectious bronchitis virus, TGEV, and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus. Highaffinity/small-molecule antibodies have been identified for the E, N, and S proteins of SARS-CoV [77]. For example, Ubah and Palliyil [83] described the advantages of phage antibodies and the prospects for their use against various viral targets.\n\n## Discussion and Prospects\nThe selection of antibody fragments from phage display libraries thus offers the potential to access very large numbers of molecules with different binding specificities quickly and cheaply, avoiding the need for animal immunizations. The scFv can be genetically engineered to produce tailored constructs as described above. Such phage antibodies can be coated directly onto metal, plastic, silica or carbon surfaces by simple adsorption, which, as discussed above, is adequate for biosensor-based assays. \n\nViruses are pervasive life forms that need a host to reproduce. From bacteria to plants and animals to viruses, a wide variety of organisms may become infected. The genome, which is represented by double-or single-stranded DNA or RNA, and the capsid are the two primary structural parts of viruses. A small number of proteins encoded by the viral genome are present in numerous copies to create the extremely symmetrical capsid [216]. Methods for virus detection are employed in contemporary virological research for a variety of applications. They can be used in epidemiology to track and manage pandemic outbreaks of illnesses caused by viruses, including swine flu, SARS-CoV-2, and many others. Diagnostic virus detection methods are central in controlling the spread of viruses and help contain viral infections. Despite its drawbacks, the use of PCR to identify particular viral genomic sequences while an infection is still active is still regarded as the best virus detection technique. However, sensor technologies using phage antibodies as sensitive elements are very promising because antibodies generated by phage display are an excellent alternative to classical antibodies. Since its development in 1985, phage display has been a crucial and successful molecular biology technique that has remained essential for the scientific community. A phage library may include millions, or perhaps billions, of distinct and distinctive mapping peptide ligands because a huge number of nucleotide fragments can be cloned into the phage genome. The epitope mapping and antigen presentation on the bacteriophage surface, which constitute the basis for phage display, have been exploited in affinity selection-based biopanning to screen for potential novel vaccine candidates [77]. \n\nPhage display is a powerful tool for target ligand selection owing to its being simple, highly effective, rapid, and cheap.\n...\nPhage display is a powerful tool for target ligand selection owing to its being simple, highly effective, rapid, and cheap. Efficient biopanning selection leads to the isolation of ligands with unique, specific, and desired functional characteristics. Phage antibody display offers multiple platforms for the use of antigen-binding; however, the diversity and stability of the library still need to be improved. \n\nIn the past few years, the need for highly sensitive bioanalytical methods to diagnose and monitor socially significant diseases has increased. This is due, on the one hand, to the growth of the disease in general, including the unprecedented spread of the new coronavirus infection, SARS-CoV-2, and, on the other hand, to the need to overcome the limitations of current biomedical diagnostic methods. For example, because of puncture invasiveness, a tissue biopsy cannot always be performed, and the results of a single biopsy often cannot provide sufficient information in real-time to diagnose the disease. PCR is currently one of the most popular tools for the rapid detection of viral infections. Nucleic acid-based virus detection usually provides high sensitivity but may require trained personnel and be time-consuming and expensive. The use of isothermal amplification systems may reduce equipment costs, making these systems indispensable when highperformance and rapid cycling testing are required. Alternatives to PCR are immunoassays, which offer reliability and cost-effectiveness. In addition, some immunoassays can be modified with lateral flow technology, which greatly speeds up the generation of results. However, immunoassays are usually inferior in sensitivity to PCR. Along with these methods, the use of next-generation sequencing can provide promising results. In addition, the ability to sequence a large number of viral genomes will provide researchers with expanded information about them and will help in tracing infections. \n\nCharacteristics such as high throughput, ease of use, and short running time play an important part, especially in viral outbreaks, in addition to the general requirement for the accuracy, validity, and specificity of viral assays. This strategy enables simple, cheap, rapid, and sensitive detection of specific pathogens, which shows great potential in virus analysis in situ.",

Since then, numerous phage-derived antibodies have been successfully developed and advanced into clinical studies, resulting in the approval of more than a dozen therapeutic antibodies. These antibodies have demonstrated efficacy across a spectrum of medical conditions, ranging from autoimmune diseases to various cancers. In this article, we provide an in-depth review of the development of phage display libraries as powerful platforms for therapeutic antibody discovery, elucidating the intricate procedures involved in antibody development. Additionally, we conduct a review of the current ntibody drugs for cancer treatment that have been developed using the phage display platform. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges inherent in this technology, offering insights into potential solutions to enhance crucial steps and facilitate more efficient drug discovery in the field of phage display technology.\n## Library Construction\nThe journey of generating antibodies through phage display technology commences with the construction of a diverse library.

As a large number of nucleotide fragments may be cloned into the phage genome, a phage library may harbour millions or sometimes billions of unique and distinctive displayed peptide ligands. The ligand\u2013receptor interactions forming the basis of phage display have been well utilized in epitope mapping and antigen presentation on the surface of bacteriophages for screening novel vaccine candidates by using affinity selection-based strategy called biopanning. This versatile technique has been modified tremendously over last three decades, leading to generation of different platforms for combinatorial peptide display. The translation of new diagnostic tools thus developed has been used in situations arising due to pathogenic microbes, including bacteria and deadly viruses, such as Zika, Ebola, Hendra, Nipah, Hanta, MERS and SARS. In the current situation of pandemic of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), a search for neutralizing antibodies is motivating the researchers to find therapeutic candidates against novel SARS-CoV-2. As phage display is an important technique for antibody selection, this review presents a concise summary of the very recent applications of phage display technique with a special reference to progress in diagnostics and therapeutics for coronavirus diseases. Hopefully, this technique can complement studies on host\u2013pathogen interactions and assist novel strategies of drug discovery for coronaviruses.",

Either randomly generated fragments of targeted pathogen DNA or synthetic random degenerate oligonucleotide inserts are cloned into the phage genome leading to generation of Natural peptide library (NPL) or Random peptide library (RPL), respectively. NPLs are more likely to mount an antibody response that cross-reacts with the native intact pathogen but a vast majority of clones in these libraries are non-functional, whereas RPLs have extended range of displayed epitopes [37,38]. When the engineered nucleotide fragments of immunoglobulins encoding the antigen-binding region are displayed, it leads to generation of antibody phage display (APD) library. Antibody expression over the phage surface is a powerful platform that allows the selection of specific antibodies when either immunized patients are not available or immunization is not ethically feasible. Due to the vast applications of this important technique, Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the year 2018 was awarded to George P. Smith and Sir Gregory P. Winter for developing and applying the phage display technique for the discovery and isolation of antibodies [1,39,40]. Major advantages of antibody phage display include as follows: production of large-sized combinatorial libraries, improved efficiency than conventional hybridoma system, easy manipulation, safety, no involvement of animal cell culture, lower propagative cost and easy screening procedures involved to select target specific binders [41][42][43]. Specifically for viral pathogens, antibody phage display is an alternative tool to hybridoma technology, since it circumvents the limitations of the immune system [44].\n\nThe antibody phage display technique was first described using gene III protein of E. coli filamentous phages and was further modified. The display formats include single-chain fragment variable (scFv), antigen-binding fragment (Fabs), single-chain fabs (scFab), human VH domains (dAbs), variable domains of heavy chain (VHHs)-also called as nanobodies, immunoglobu",

Anand, N. Virmani, B. C. Bera, R. Vaid, M. Vashisth, Priyanka Bardajatya, Ashok Kumar, B. N. Tripathi\n## Abstract\nPhage display is one of the important and effective molecular biology techniques and has remained indispensable for research community since its discovery in the year 1985. As a large number of nucleotide fragments may be cloned into the phage genome, a phage library may harbour millions or sometimes billions of unique and distinctive displayed peptide ligands. The ligand\u2013receptor interactions forming the basis of phage display have been well utilized in epitope mapping and antigen presentation on the surface of bacteriophages for screening novel vaccine candidates by using affinity selection-based strategy called biopanning. This versatile technique has been modified tremendously over last three decades, leading to generation of different platforms for combinatorial peptide display. The translation of new diagnostic tools thus developed has been used in situations arising due to pathogenic microbes, including bacteria and deadly viruses, such as Zika, Ebola, Hendra, Nipah, Hanta, MERS and SARS. In the current situation of pandemic of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), a search for neutralizing antibodies is motivating the researchers to find therapeutic candidates against novel SARS-CoV-2. As phage display is an important technique for antibody selection, this review presents a concise summary of the very recent applications of phage display technique with a special reference to progress in diagnostics and therapeutics for coronavirus diseases. Hopefully, this technique can complement studies on host\u2013pathogen interactions and assist novel strategies of drug discovery for coronaviruses.\n## Strategies of Phage Display for Development of Diagnostics\nPhage display library may be constructed using any of the above-mentioned phage display systems and screened to obtain the most promising binders exhibiting strongest affinity for the target molecule/pathogen for use in diagnostics and immunotherapy. Either randomly generated fragments of targeted pathogen DNA or synthetic random degenerate oligonucleotide inserts are cloned into the phage genome leading to generation of Natural peptide library (NPL) or Random peptide library (RPL), respectively. NPLs are more likely to mount an antibody response that cross-reacts with the native intact pathogen but a vast majority of clones in these libraries are non-functional, whereas RPLs have extended range of displayed epitopes [37,38]. When the engineered nucleotide fragments of immunoglobulins encoding the antigen-binding region are displayed, it leads to generation of antibody phage display (APD) library. Antibody expression over the phage surface is a powerful platform that allows the selection of specific antibodies when either immunized patients are not available or immunization is not ethically feasible. Due to the vast applications of this important technique, Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the year 2018 was awarded to George P. Smith and Sir Gregory P. Winter for developing and applying the phage display technique for the discovery and isolation of antibodies [1,39,40]. Major advantages of antibody phage display include as follows: production of large-sized combinatorial libraries, improved efficiency than conventional hybridoma system, easy manipulation, safety, no involvement of animal cell culture, lower propagative cost and easy screening procedures involved to select target specific binders [41][42][43]. Specifically for viral pathogens, antibody phage display is an alternative tool to hybridoma technology, since it circumvents the limitations of the immune system [44].\n\nThe antibody phage display technique was first described using gene III protein of E. coli filamentous phages and was further modified. The display formats include single-chain fragment variable (scFv), antigen-binding fragment (Fabs), single-chain fabs (scFab), human VH domains (dAbs), variable domains of heavy chain (VHHs)-also called as nanobodies, immunoglobu",

                    "text": "Antibody phage display is an in vitro screening technique that allows for rapid selection of multiple monoclonal antibodies of high affinity and specificity (Hoogenboom, 2005). It involves the display of a polyclonal collection of antibody fragments containing the variable regions, numbering up to 10 11 different clones, on the surface of filamentous phage carrying the genetic sequence of the displayed fragment. Antibody library repertoires can be obtained primarily by two methods, either from cDNA antibody sequences derived from the B cells of immunized or non-immune animal or human donors, or synthetically generated using random nucleotide sequences within selected CDRs (complementarity-determining regions) in combination with one or multiple framework regions to replicate the diversity of a natural antibody repertoire (Conrad and Scheller, 2005). These sequences are then fused to the sequence encoding the gene III (gIII) coat protein of the phage, enabling expression and incorporation of the antibody fragment on its surface. This collection of phage-displayed antibodies is then panned repeatedly against the antigen of interest, producing a polyclonal phage collection enriched for antigen-specific antibodies, from which individual monoclonal clones can then be identified and characterized. \n\nThe rapidity of this technique makes it ideal for generating novel antibodies for diagnostic and potentially therapeutic responses to outbreaks of emerging infectious disease such as SARS coronavirus and H5N1 Avian Influenza or genetically modified pathogens released in a bioterrorism incident. Since antibodies are highly specific and are capable of recognizing virtually every class of pathogen, including toxins, viruses, bacteria and fungi, they enable easy and rapid identification of pathogens (Nowakowski et al., 2002;Hayhurst et al., 2003;Paoli et al., 2004;Steiniger et al., 2007;Cabezas et al., 2008). Indeed, sandwich ELISAs utilizing high affinity mouse monoclonal antibodies have been developed against likely bioterrorist threats such as epsilon toxin of Clostridium botulinum and protective antigen, a toxin component of anthrax, with demonstrated toxin detection limits of 1-2 ng/ml (el Idrissi and Ward, 1992;Mabry et al., 2006).",

Z. Chan, A. H. Chan, A. P. Lim, B. Hanson\n## Abstract\nNone\n## Introduction\nAntibody phage display is an in vitro screening technique that allows for rapid selection of multiple monoclonal antibodies of high affinity and specificity (Hoogenboom, 2005). It involves the display of a polyclonal collection of antibody fragments containing the variable regions, numbering up to 10 11 different clones, on the surface of filamentous phage carrying the genetic sequence of the displayed fragment. Antibody library repertoires can be obtained primarily by two methods, either from cDNA antibody sequences derived from the B cells of immunized or non-immune animal or human donors, or synthetically generated using random nucleotide sequences within selected CDRs (complementarity-determining regions) in combination with one or multiple framework regions to replicate the diversity of a natural antibody repertoire (Conrad and Scheller, 2005). These sequences are then fused to the sequence encoding the gene III (gIII) coat protein of the phage, enabling expression and incorporation of the antibody fragment on its surface. This collection of phage-displayed antibodies is then panned repeatedly against the antigen of interest, producing a polyclonal phage collection enriched for antigen-specific antibodies, from which individual monoclonal clones can then be identified and characterized. \n\nThe rapidity of this technique makes it ideal for generating novel antibodies for diagnostic and potentially therapeutic responses to outbreaks of emerging infectious disease such as SARS coronavirus and H5N1 Avian Influenza or genetically modified pathogens released in a bioterrorism incident. Since antibodies are highly specific and are capable of recognizing virtually every class of pathogen, including toxins, viruses, bacteria and fungi, they enable easy and rapid identification of pathogens (Nowakowski et al., 2002;Hayhurst et al., 2003;Paoli et al., 2004;Steiniger et al., 2007;Cabezas et al., 2008). Indeed, sandwich ELISAs utilizing high affinity mouse monoclonal antibodies have been developed against likely bioterrorist threats such as epsilon toxin of Clostridium botulinum and protective antigen, a toxin component of anthrax, with demonstrated toxin detection limits of 1-2 ng/ml (el Idrissi and Ward, 1992;Mabry et al., 2006).",

Recent developments in single molecule detection technologies enable the detection limit of the sandwich immunoassays approaching femtomolar (10\u201315 M), driving the needs of developing sensitive and specific antibodies for ever-increasingly broad applications in detecting and quantifying biomarkers. The key components underlying the sandwich immunoassays are antibody-based affinity reagents, for which the conventional sources are mono- or poly-clonal antibodies from immunized animals. The downsides of the animal-based antibodies as affinity reagents arise from the requirement of months of development timespan and limited choices of antibody candidates due to immunodominance of humoral immune responses in animals. Hence, developing animal antibodies capable of distinguishing highly related antigens could be challenging. To overcome the limitation imposed by the animal immune systems, we developed an in vitro methodology based on phage-displayed synthetic antibody libraries for diverse antibodies as affinity reagents against closely related influenza virus nucleoprotein (NP) subtypes, aiming to differentiating avian influenza virus (H5N1) from seasonal influenza viruses (H1N1 and H3N2), for which the NPs are closely related by 90\u201394% in terms of pairwise amino acid sequence identity. We applied the methodology to attain, within four weeks, a panel of IgGs with distinguishable specificities against a group of representative NPs with pairwise amino acid sequence identities up to more than 90%, and the antibodies derived from the antibody libraries without further affinity refinement had comparable affinity of mouse antibodies to the NPs with the detection limit less than 1 nM of viral NP from lysed virus with sandwich ELISA. The panel of IgGs were capable of rapidly distinguishing infections due to virulent avian influenza virus from infections of seasonal flu, in responding to a probable emergency scenario where avian influenza virus would be transmissible among humans overlapping with the seasonal influenza infections. The results indicate that the in vitro antibody development methodology enables developing diagnostic antibodies that would not otherwise be available from animal-based antibody technologies.\n",

This review presents the phage display technology, application areas of antibodies in research, diagnostics and therapy and the use of antibody phage display for these applications.\n## Antibodies for Diagnostics\nThere are three general ways to use antibodies for diagnostics.The first way is the detection of antigens using antibodies [77] and the second, but reversed way is the detection of serum antibodies using antigens [78].The third way is the competition assay, here, e.g., antigens are detected by serum antibodies which compete with a defined antibody preparation [79].The advantage of an antibody competition assay is its species independence [80].Other prominent technologies used for diagnostics are lateral flow strip assays [81,82], bead based assays such as Luminex [83], flow cytometry [58,84], the hemagglutination assay [85], and more recently, the proximity ligation assay [86] or molecular imaging [87].An interesting diagnostic method is the direct use of phage particles fused to antibodies [88] for diagnostics.Sensitivity of the diagnostic assay can be enhanced by detection of the about 2700 copies of pVIII of an antibody phage by secondary antibodies [89,90].Antibody phage particles can also be used for immuno-PCR [91].\n\nTo date, there are many examples for the application of antibodies derived by phage display for diagnostics [92][93][94].A big advantage of antibody phage display for diagnostics is the direct access to the genetic information of the binder, allowing a fast adaption of the antibody format e.g., IgG, scFv-Fc, biotinylated antibody or scFv-phoA fusion [40] to the desired diagnostic assay.\n\nPhage display allows also the identification of immunogenic proteins, e.g., from pathogens [95][96][97].Combining antibody phage display with antigen phage display all steps from identification of antigens to the generation of antibodies against these antigens for diagnostics are available.",

Goulart\n## Abstract\nThe current frontiers in biological sciences demand an interface among disciplines of biology, chemistry, and physics to achieve new paradigms in applied nanobiotechnologies to health. An extraordinary amount of information on genomes, transcriptomes, proteomes, metabolomes, miRNAs, lncRNAs, protein editing, post-translational modifications, exosomes, molecular interactions, cell signaling, structural biology, immunology, cellular receptors, interactomes, and bioinformatics are opening new possibilities for biological manipulations aiming improved diagnostics and therapeutics. New rationale is required to use available technologies that intersect among imaging, electrochemistry, biophotonics, nanotechnologies and combinatorial molecules. A massive, diverse and broad knowledge on multidisciplinary aspects have been provided in the last few years, and the challenge is to combine recent technologies and information to identify revolutionary platforms for the progression of life sciences. This brief review will discuss examples of epitope-based and combinatorial antibody and nucleic acid (aptamers) selection technologies in association with nanobiotechnologies and their multiple applications in biomedical sciences.\n## Discovery of biomarkers using combinatorial technologies\nCombinatorial libraries displaying very diverse set of random peptides or very large repertoire of antibody fragments' fused to the capsid surface of filamentous phage have been successfully exploited in the discovery of novel biomarkers, and are excellent platforms for the design of high-affinity, protein-based binding reagents. Such markers are either peptide ligands that mimic epitope regions (mimotope) or monoclonal antibody fragments (Fab or scFv) against specific targets selected through cycles of biopanning (binding-washing-elutiontransformation-amplification), also called Phage Display. The fundamental advantage of this technology is the direct link between the experimental phenotype and its encapsulated genotype, which allows the evolution of selected binders into optimized molecules [1,2]. Peptide ligands may be used to map immunologically active sites in proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and also as individual epitope-mimicking antigens and immunogens [3,4]. The selected mimotopes may also be directly used in phage-based ELISA immunoassays, resulting in simple, specific, sensitive, and low-cost immunodiagnostic tests [5]. Similarly, the selection of antibodies from combinatorial libraries has also become an important tool for the generation of reagents, diagnostics, and therapeutic molecules. It is the only method to obtain specific antibodies bypassing the immunization step, which mimics the maturation process of human antibody in vivo, resulting in high affinity antibody ligands, which may be suitable to human administration and potentially applicable to clinical diagnosis and treatment. We have generated successful molecules for diagnostic [5][6][7][8] and therapeutic [7,9] purposes through phage display by in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo approaches of selection.",

It helps create antibodies that can specifically bind to complex antigens, which is crucial for identifying biomarkers and improving diagnostics and treatments. However, existing reviews often overlook its importance in areas outside cancer research. This review aims to fill that gap by explaining the basics of phage display and its applications in detecting and treating various non-cancerous diseases. We focus especially on its role in degenerative diseases, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, and chronic non-communicable diseases, showing how it is changing the way we diagnose and treat illnesses. By highlighting important discoveries and future possibilities, we hope to emphasize the significance of phage display in modern healthcare.",

It helps create antibodies that can specifically bind to complex antigens, which is crucial for identifying biomarkers and improving diagnostics and treatments. However, existing reviews often overlook its importance in areas outside cancer research. This review aims to fill that gap by explaining the basics of phage display and its applications in detecting and treating various non-cancerous diseases. We focus especially on its role in degenerative diseases, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, and chronic non-communicable diseases, showing how it is changing the way we diagnose and treat illnesses. By highlighting important discoveries and future possibilities, we hope to emphasize the significance of phage display in modern healthcare.\n## The Diagnostic Effectiveness of Phage Display Technology\nNumerous recombinant antibodies and peptides against pathogens and cancer antigens have been developed for diagnostic purposes using phage display.Peptides generated by phage display have the potential to be exploited for molecular imaging diagnostics in the field of cancer [19].These peptides can be employed in imaging various malignancies by conjugating or labeling them with nanoparticles, radionuclides, and fluorescents.The conventional method for tumor imaging is performed by monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with whole size.Peptides could be more effective than antibodies because of their low molecular weight which provides better tumor penetration and low immunogenicity because of lacking Fc regions [20,21].\n\nIn one study, for example, a peptide with specific binding capabilities to the extracellular domain of HER3 (HER3P1) was produced by the phage display technique [22].Traditional HER3 imaging, which uses a radiolabeled full-size antibody-like patritumab, does not lead to accurate PET imaging since these antibodies exhibit weak tumor penetration and non-specific accumulation in tissues that are not the target [23,24].It demonstrated that the radiolabeled HER3P1 had a potential for application in clinical imaging as it showed a great specificity and low background uptake by in vivo PET imaging [22].\n\nEmploying phage display, a diverse set of recombinant antibodies for pathogen detection (e.g., bacteria and viruses) has been developed.Since this technology comprises an in vitro screening procedure, it has eliminated the limitations and constraints of hybridoma technology [25].The majority of these antibodies, which are antibody fragments such as scFv, Fab, and nanobodies, are applied in ELISA, immunoblot, immunofluorescent assays, and immunoprecipitation [26].\n\nAlthough generating monoclonal antibodies is both an expensive and time-consuming task, they are widely deployed in immunological tests.In contrast, phage display allows for the quick collection of recombinant antibodies at a low cost and with the same affinity.Furthermore, in certain investigations, antibodies generated through phage display were more sensitive toward an antigen compared to other traditional techniques.\n...\nFurthermore, in certain investigations, antibodies generated through phage display were more sensitive toward an antigen compared to other traditional techniques.A peptide that binds the spike protein of the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) was developed by Suo and colleagues using phage display for diagnostic purposes.It was discovered that phage-mediated ELISA was more sensitive than conventional antibody-based ELISA [27].\n\nIn a recent investigation, Sulong et al. used phage display to design a VH antibody against capsular polysaccharide (CPS) of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (Figure 2A).It has been demonstrated that this VH antibody has the potential to be a useful diagnostic instrument for S. suis serotype differentiation since similar epitopes are shared by serotypes 1, 1/2, 2, and 14 (Figure 2B) [28,29].The positive phage clone 47B3 displaying VH antibody disclosed the highest binding ability with no cross-reactivity with S. suis serotypes 1/2, 1, or 14, whereas prior mAbs against S. suis serotype 2 have revealed cross-reactivity with serotypes 2, 1/2, 1, and 14.Furthermore, the pure VH antibody (namely 47B3 VH) has the remarkable ability to discriminate between serotypes 2 and 1/2 effectively (Figure 2C), which is not possible to be detected by PCR-based serotyping [30].The purpose of this review is to highlight the applications of phage display as a therapeutic and diagnostic tool in non-cancerous diseases.Additionally, a very recent study developed an innovative method to characterize exosomes using phage display technology.This breakthrough system for detecting and isolating disease-related exosomes could be useful in defining novel biomarkers to treat diseases where exosomes are involved [31].",

To obtain binders with the desired binding specificity a series of surface and solution phage-display biopannings were performed. Initially, three rounds of surface biopanning against gamma-irradiated L. monocytogenes serovar 4b cells were performed followed by an additional surface biopanning round against L. monocytogenes 4b which included prior subtraction biopanning against gamma-irradiated L. innocua cells. In an attempt to further enhance binder specificity for L. monocytogenes 4b two rounds of solution biopanning were performed, both rounds included initial subtraction solution biopanning against L. innocua. Subsequent evaluations were performed on the phage clones by phage binding ELISA. All phage clones tested from the second round of solution biopanning had higher specificity for L. monocytogenes 4b than for L. innocua and three other foodborne pathogens (Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli and Campylobacter jejuni). Further evaluation with five other Listeria spp. revealed that one phage clone in particular, expressing peptide GRIADLPPLKPN, was highly specific for L. monocytogenes with at least 43-fold more binding capability to L. monocytogenes 4b than to any other Listeria sp. This proof-of-principle study demonstrates how a combination of surface, solution and subtractive biopanning was used to maximise binder specificity. L. monocytogenes-specific binders were obtained which could have potential application in novel detection tests for L. monocytogenes, benefiting both the food and medical industries.",

To enhance the detection and identification of L. monocytogenes more rapid methods are urgently needed to meet current demands for food safety testing. A number of rapid methods have been developed, for example immunological techniques such as biosensor [10,11], enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [12] and antibody array [13,14] and, genotypic techniques such as real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) [15][16][17], deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) microarray [18] and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) methods [19,20]. Listeria spp. are closely related both morphologically and biochemically making it difficult to distinguish L. monocytogenes from other Listeria spp. Although genotypic techniques that rely on detecting unique DNA sequences between species are available, such techniques can be time-consuming requiring additional sample extraction steps. Culture combined with immunological techniques are used more routinely, however, generating antibodies with the desired specificity and sensitivity for L. monocytogenes detection presents the challenge of identifying cell surface epitopes which are specific.\n\nSuccessful rapid diagnostic techniques require a specific and high affinitybinder, usually an antibody. Development of animal derived antibodies is not an easy task and they are expensive to produce. In addition efforts are ongoing to reduce, refine and replace the use of animals in scientific research in accordance with EU legislation, Directive 2010/63/EU [21]. Phage display biopanning is a technique extending from the invention of phage display technology in 1985 [22] and offers an alternative means of generating specific affinity ligands. This technique has been used previously in an attempt to generate alternative binders to L. monocytogenes; Paoli et al. [5,23] and Nanduri et al. [24] produced phage display-derived antibody fragments to L. monocytogenes, while Carnazza et al. [25] described the production of phage display",

McIvor, N. Karoonuthaisiri, Ratthaphol Charlermroj, L. Stewart, C. Elliott, I. Grant\n## Abstract\nThe objective of this study was to produce phage display-derived binders with the ability to distinguish Listeria monocytogenes from other Listeria spp., which may have potential utility to enhance detection of Listeria monocytogenes. To obtain binders with the desired binding specificity a series of surface and solution phage-display biopannings were performed. Initially, three rounds of surface biopanning against gamma-irradiated L. monocytogenes serovar 4b cells were performed followed by an additional surface biopanning round against L. monocytogenes 4b which included prior subtraction biopanning against gamma-irradiated L. innocua cells. In an attempt to further enhance binder specificity for L. monocytogenes 4b two rounds of solution biopanning were performed, both rounds included initial subtraction solution biopanning against L. innocua. Subsequent evaluations were performed on the phage clones by phage binding ELISA. All phage clones tested from the second round of solution biopanning had higher specificity for L. monocytogenes 4b than for L. innocua and three other foodborne pathogens (Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli and Campylobacter jejuni). Further evaluation with five other Listeria spp. revealed that one phage clone in particular, expressing peptide GRIADLPPLKPN, was highly specific for L. monocytogenes with at least 43-fold more binding capability to L. monocytogenes 4b than to any other Listeria sp. This proof-of-principle study demonstrates how a combination of surface, solution and subtractive biopanning was used to maximise binder specificity. L. monocytogenes-specific binders were obtained which could have potential application in novel detection tests for L. monocytogenes, benefiting both the food and medical industries.\n## Introduction\novar 4b causing the majority of human epidemics [8,9].\n\nThe current commercially available tests for Listeria spp. are mostly culture techniques which tend to be labour and time intensive. To enhance the detection and identification of L. monocytogenes more rapid methods are urgently needed to meet current demands for food safety testing. A number of rapid methods have been developed, for example immunological techniques such as biosensor [10,11], enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [12] and antibody array [13,14] and, genotypic techniques such as real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) [15][16][17], deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) microarray [18] and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) methods [19,20]. Listeria spp. are closely related both morphologically and biochemically making it difficult to distinguish L. monocytogenes from other Listeria spp. Although genotypic techniques that rely on detecting unique DNA sequences between species are available, such techniques can be time-consuming requiring additional sample extraction steps. Culture combined with immunological techniques are used more routinely, however, generating antibodies with the desired specificity and sensitivity for L. monocytogenes detection presents the challenge of identifying cell surface epitopes which are specific.\n\nSuccessful rapid diagnostic techniques require a specific and high affinitybinder, usually an antibody. Development of animal derived antibodies is not an easy task and they are expensive to produce. In addition efforts are ongoing to reduce, refine and replace the use of animals in scientific research in accordance with EU legislation, Directive 2010/63/EU [21]. Phage display biopanning is a technique extending from the invention of phage display technology in 1985 [22] and offers an alternative means of generating specific affinity ligands. This technique has been used previously in an attempt to generate alternative binders to L. monocytogenes; Paoli et al. [5,23] and Nanduri et al. [24] produced phage display-derived antibody fragments to L. monocytogenes, while Carnazza et al. [25] described the production of phage display",

            "abstract": "The M13 phage carries approximately 5 copies of the pIII protein, each of which is capable of displaying a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) that targets a specific antigen. This feature enables the M13 phage to be widely employed in the construction of scFv libraries, thereby facilitating the identification of antibodies with high specificity and affinity for target antigens. In this study, mice were immunized three times with Salmonella enteritidis (strain C50041) to induce diverse antibodies. The variable region sequences were subsequently amplified by PCR using genome extracted from the mice's splenic cells and fused to the pIII protein to construct the scFv phage display library (C50041-M13-scFv). Through biopanning with the C50041-M13-scFv library, a phage clone (C50041-scFv-4) exhibiting high affinity for the target bacteria was successfully obtained. Moreover, the scFv antibody (scFv-4) derived from C50041-scFv-4 was expressed in a prokaryotic expression system and validated to possess high specificity and affinity for C50041 through in vitro adsorption assays. Additionally, a phage-ELISA method was established: initially, bacteria were immobilized on the bottom surface of a 96-well plate. Next, the positive clone C50041-scFv-4 was introduced to specifically bind to the host cells. Finally, horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-pVIII antibodies were used to detect the pVIII proteins of the bound phage clones. Owing to the capacity of multiple C50041-scFv-4 probes to simultaneously bind to a single target Salmonella and each phage clone's ability to accommodate hundreds of HRP-labeled antibodies, the proposed phage-ELISA demonstrated remarkable sensitivity (104 CFU mL-1) for detecting Salmonella enteritidis samples. This sensitivity surpasses that of traditional ELISA by one order of magnitude in this study. Our phage-ELISA technology exhibits broad applicability across various biological species and provides an improved and robust platform for pathogen detection including bacteria and viruses.",

This feature enables the M13 phage to be widely employed in the construction of scFv libraries, thereby facilitating the identification of antibodies with high specificity and affinity for target antigens. In this study, mice were immunized three times with Salmonella enteritidis (strain C50041) to induce diverse antibodies. The variable region sequences were subsequently amplified by PCR using genome extracted from the mice's splenic cells and fused to the pIII protein to construct the scFv phage display library (C50041-M13-scFv). Through biopanning with the C50041-M13-scFv library, a phage clone (C50041-scFv-4) exhibiting high affinity for the target bacteria was successfully obtained. Moreover, the scFv antibody (scFv-4) derived from C50041-scFv-4 was expressed in a prokaryotic expression system and validated to possess high specificity and affinity for C50041 through in vitro adsorption assays. Additionally, a phage-ELISA method was established: initially, bacteria were immobilized on the bottom surface of a 96-well plate. Next, the positive clone C50041-scFv-4 was introduced to specifically bind to the host cells. Finally, horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-pVIII antibodies were used to detect the pVIII proteins of the bound phage clones. Owing to the capacity of multiple C50041-scFv-4 probes to simultaneously bind to a single target Salmonella and each phage clone's ability to accommodate hundreds of HRP-labeled antibodies, the proposed phage-ELISA demonstrated remarkable sensitivity (104 CFU mL-1) for detecting Salmonella enteritidis samples. This sensitivity surpasses that of traditional ELISA by one order of magnitude in this study. Our phage-ELISA technology exhibits broad applicability across various biological species and provides an improved and robust platform for pathogen detection including bacteria and viruses.\n",

F1 is encoded by the caf1 gene located on the large 100-kb pFra plasmid, which is found in Y. pestis but not in closely related species such as Yersinia enterocolytica and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. In order to find antibodies specifically binding to Y. pestis we screened a large single chain Fv antibody fragment (scFv) phage display library using purified F1 antigen as a selection target. Different forms of the selected antibodies were used to establish assays for recombinant F1 antigen and Y. pestis detection. Methods Phage antibody panning was performed against F1 in an automated fashion using the Kingfisher magnetic bead system. Selected scFvs were screened for F1-binding specificity by one-step alkaline phosphatase enzyme linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA), and assayed for binding to recombinant antigen and/or Y. pestis by flow cytometry and whole-cell ELISA. Results Seven of the eight selected scFvs were shown to specifically bind both recombinant F1 and a panel of F1-positive Yersinia cells. The majority of the soluble scFvs were found to be difficult to purify, unstable and prone to cross-reactivity with F1-negative Yersinia strains, whereas phage displayed scFvs were found to be easy to purify/label and remarkably stable. Furthermore direct fluorescent labeling of phage displaying scFv allowed for an easy one-step flow cytometry assay. Slight cross-reactivity was observed when fixed cells were used in ELISA. Conclusions Our high throughput methods of selection and screening allowed for time and cost effective discovery of seven scFvs specifically binding Y. pestis F1 antigen. We describe implementation of different methods for phage-based immunoassay. Based on the success of these methods and the proven stability of phage, we indicate that the use of phage-displayed, rather than phage-free proteins, might generally overcome the shortcomings of scFv antibodies.",

Phages are well-matched for vaccine design due to being highly stable under harsh environmental conditions, simple and inexpensive large scale production, and potent adjuvant capacities. Phage vaccines have efficient immunostimulatory effects and present a high safety profile because these viruses have made a constant relationship with the mammalian body during a long-standing evolutionary period. The birth of phage display technology has been a turning point in the development of phage-based vaccines. Phage display vaccines are made by expressing multiple copies of an antigen on the surface of immunogenic phage particles, thereby eliciting a powerful and effective immune response. Also, the ability to produce combinatorial peptide libraries with a highly diverse pool of randomized ligands has transformed phage display into a straightforward, versatile and high throughput screening methodology for the identification of potential vaccine candidates against different diseases in particular microbial infections. These libraries can be conveniently screened through an affinity selection-based strategy called biopanning against a wide variety of targets for the selection of mimotopes with high antigenicity and immunogenicity. Also, they can be panned against the antiserum of convalescent individuals to recognize novel peptidomimetics of pathogen-related epitopes. Phage display has represented enormous promise for finding new strategies of vaccine discovery and production and current breakthroughs promise a brilliant future for the development of different phage-based vaccine platforms.",

                    "text": "Phage display has been introduced as an efficient alternative to hybridoma technology for the generation of therapeutically relevant antibodies. Antibody phage display (APD) provides the opportunity to design and construct large libraries of antibody fragments. The expression of antibodies on the surface of phage particles represents a powerful platform for the isolation of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with desired binding characteristics that can serve for the diagnosis and immunotherapy of various disorders especially infectious diseases [35]. \n\nAccording to the source of antibody-encoding sequences, phage antibody libraries (PALs) are divided into two main types of natural and synthetic libraries. Natural PALs consist of rearranged V gene repertoires of immune or non-immune (na\u00efve) donors. This type of antibody library has been constructed from different species including human, non-human primates, mouse, chicken, sheep, camel, and cattle. Immune libraries are considered as the most useful type of PALs for infectious diseases. They are constructed from immunized donors and typically exploited to obtain antibodies against a particular target antigen, e.g. an infectious viral or bacterial agent. A great advantage of immune PALs is that V genes harbor hypermutations and are affinity matured, though the toxicity of some antigens and ethical issues make it impossible to immunize human subjects with toxic, immunosuppressive, and life-threatening antigens. If immunization is not possible or is ethically impracticable, the construction of non-immune or na\u00efve PALs is an alternative. These libraries are generated from rearranged V gene repertoires of B cells derived from healthy and non-immunized donors. Accordingly, ethical issues with regard to the active immunization of humans and animals are avoided. Also, specific antibodies against non-immunogenic and toxic antigens can also be obtained.

Aghebati-Maleki, Babak Bakhshinejad, B. Baradaran, M. Motallebnezhad, Ali Aghebati-Maleki, Hamid Nickho, M. Yousefi, J. Majidi\n## Abstract\nBacteriophages are specific antagonists to bacterial hosts. These viral entities have attracted growing interest as optimal vaccine delivery vehicles. Phages are well-matched for vaccine design due to being highly stable under harsh environmental conditions, simple and inexpensive large scale production, and potent adjuvant capacities. Phage vaccines have efficient immunostimulatory effects and present a high safety profile because these viruses have made a constant relationship with the mammalian body during a long-standing evolutionary period. The birth of phage display technology has been a turning point in the development of phage-based vaccines. Phage display vaccines are made by expressing multiple copies of an antigen on the surface of immunogenic phage particles, thereby eliciting a powerful and effective immune response. Also, the ability to produce combinatorial peptide libraries with a highly diverse pool of randomized ligands has transformed phage display into a straightforward, versatile and high throughput screening methodology for the identification of potential vaccine candidates against different diseases in particular microbial infections. These libraries can be conveniently screened through an affinity selection-based strategy called biopanning against a wide variety of targets for the selection of mimotopes with high antigenicity and immunogenicity. Also, they can be panned against the antiserum of convalescent individuals to recognize novel peptidomimetics of pathogen-related epitopes. Phage display has represented enormous promise for finding new strategies of vaccine discovery and production and current breakthroughs promise a brilliant future for the development of different phage-based vaccine platforms.\n## Phage display: development of therapeutic antibodies\nPhage display has been introduced as an efficient alternative to hybridoma technology for the generation of therapeutically relevant antibodies. Antibody phage display (APD) provides the opportunity to design and construct large libraries of antibody fragments. The expression of antibodies on the surface of phage particles represents a powerful platform for the isolation of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with desired binding characteristics that can serve for the diagnosis and immunotherapy of various disorders especially infectious diseases [35]. \n\nAccording to the source of antibody-encoding sequences, phage antibody libraries (PALs) are divided into two main types of natural and synthetic libraries. Natural PALs consist of rearranged V gene repertoires of immune or non-immune (na\u00efve) donors. This type of antibody library has been constructed from different species including human, non-human primates, mouse, chicken, sheep, camel, and cattle. Immune libraries are considered as the most useful type of PALs for infectious diseases. They are constructed from immunized donors and typically exploited to obtain antibodies against a particular target antigen, e.g. an infectious viral or bacterial agent. A great advantage of immune PALs is that V genes harbor hypermutations and are affinity matured, though the toxicity of some antigens and ethical issues make it impossible to immunize human subjects with toxic, immunosuppressive, and life-threatening antigens. If immunization is not possible or is ethically impracticable, the construction of non-immune or na\u00efve PALs is an alternative. These libraries are generated from rearranged V gene repertoires of B cells derived from healthy and non-immunized donors. Accordingly, ethical issues with regard to the active immunization of humans and animals are avoided. Also, specific antibodies against non-immunogenic and toxic antigens can also be obtained. However, the isolated antibodies generally show low affinity. This emphasizes the need to improve binding affinity of the selected antibodies by using affinity maturation in vitro [36,37]. Unlike natural PALs that represent the naturally occurring diversity in the antibody repertoire, synthetic PALs harbor artificial diversity in V gene segments. In these PALs, V genes are reconstructed in vitro partially (semi-synthetic PALs) or completely (fully synthetic PALs).",

            "abstract": "It has been more than three decades since the first monoclonal antibody was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) in 1986, and during this time, antibody engineering has dramatically evolved. Current antibody drugs have increasingly fewer adverse effects due to their high specificity. As a result, therapeutic antibodies have become the predominant class of new drugs developed in recent years. Over the past five years, antibodies have become the best-selling drugs in the pharmaceutical market, and in 2018, eight of the top ten bestselling drugs worldwide were biologics. The global therapeutic monoclonal antibody market was valued at approximately US$115.2 billion in 2018 and is expected to generate revenue of $150 billion by the end of 2019 and $300 billion by 2025. Thus, the market for therapeutic antibody drugs has experienced explosive growth as new drugs have been approved for treating various human diseases, including many cancers, autoimmune, metabolic and infectious diseases. As of December 2019, 79 therapeutic mAbs have been approved by the US FDA, but there is still significant growth potential. This review summarizes the latest market trends and outlines the preeminent antibody engineering technologies used in the development of therapeutic antibody drugs, such as humanization of monoclonal antibodies, phage display, the human antibody mouse, single B cell antibody technology, and affinity maturation. Finally, future applications and perspectives are also discussed.",

Antibody Fab fragments displayed on the phage coat protein have comparably higher structural stability and can be readily converted to intact IgG antibodies, usually without impairing binding activity [100,101]. The elegance of phage-displayed libraries is apparent in the linkage between antibody phenotype (specificity and sensitivity) and genotype (genetic information) via the phage particle. Due to the small size and high solubility (10 13 particles/ml) of phage particles, repertoire sizes up to 10 11 independent clones can be efficiently produced and displayed in a single library [102][103][104].\n\nGene repertoires for phage display libraries can be obtained from na\u00efve or immunized animals, or the libraries may be synthetically constructed using randomized CDR c Biopanning with a phagedisplayed library. Initial pools of antibodies on the surface of phages are applied to antigens immobilized on a solid surface, e.g., ELISA plates or magnetic beads. Non-specific phages are removed by stringent washing. Antigen-bound phages are eluted and re-infected into E. coli to produce a subset of phages for the next cycle of panning. After several rounds, the antigen-binding clones are sufficiently enriched and individual clones can be selected for further analysis sequences within fixed frameworks. Phage display na\u00efve antibody libraries are constructed from rearranged V genes of IgM repertoires. Because the gene sequences are derived from B cells of human donors, the na\u00efve libraries are relatively close to the human antibody germ line and have a low risk of immunogenicity. The main advantage of an immunized library over a na\u00efve library is that antibody genes in the immunized library have undergone natural affinity maturation in vivo, allowing the development of high-affinity antibodies against the target. However, this approach requires that immunogenic response can be successfully induced by the antigen of interest, and new libraries must be prepared for each new target. Single large na\u00efve [94,104,105] and synthetic [102,106,107] libraries have yielded high affinity antibodies (sub-nanomolar range) against a wide spectrum of targets. Therefore,",

Liu, Chi-Chiu Lee, Han-zen Tsai, Hsin-Jung Li, Han\u2010Chung Wu\n## Abstract\nIt has been more than three decades since the first monoclonal antibody was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) in 1986, and during this time, antibody engineering has dramatically evolved. Current antibody drugs have increasingly fewer adverse effects due to their high specificity. As a result, therapeutic antibodies have become the predominant class of new drugs developed in recent years. Over the past five years, antibodies have become the best-selling drugs in the pharmaceutical market, and in 2018, eight of the top ten bestselling drugs worldwide were biologics. The global therapeutic monoclonal antibody market was valued at approximately US$115.2 billion in 2018 and is expected to generate revenue of $150 billion by the end of 2019 and $300 billion by 2025. Thus, the market for therapeutic antibody drugs has experienced explosive growth as new drugs have been approved for treating various human diseases, including many cancers, autoimmune, metabolic and infectious diseases. As of December 2019, 79 therapeutic mAbs have been approved by the US FDA, but there is still significant growth potential. This review summarizes the latest market trends and outlines the preeminent antibody engineering technologies used in the development of therapeutic antibody drugs, such as humanization of monoclonal antibodies, phage display, the human antibody mouse, single B cell antibody technology, and affinity maturation. Finally, future applications and perspectives are also discussed.\n## Generation of human antibodies by phage display Overview of antibody phage libraries\nb); scFvs are composed of the V H and V L domain connected by a short flexible linker. Antibody Fab fragments displayed on the phage coat protein have comparably higher structural stability and can be readily converted to intact IgG antibodies, usually without impairing binding activity [100,101]. The elegance of phage-displayed libraries is apparent in the linkage between antibody phenotype (specificity and sensitivity) and genotype (genetic information) via the phage particle. Due to the small size and high solubility (10 13 particles/ml) of phage particles, repertoire sizes up to 10 11 independent clones can be efficiently produced and displayed in a single library [102][103][104].\n\nGene repertoires for phage display libraries can be obtained from na\u00efve or immunized animals, or the libraries may be synthetically constructed using randomized CDR c Biopanning with a phagedisplayed library. Initial pools of antibodies on the surface of phages are applied to antigens immobilized on a solid surface, e.g., ELISA plates or magnetic beads. Non-specific phages are removed by stringent washing. Antigen-bound phages are eluted and re-infected into E. coli to produce a subset of phages for the next cycle of panning. After several rounds, the antigen-binding clones are sufficiently enriched and individual clones can be selected for further analysis sequences within fixed frameworks. Phage display na\u00efve antibody libraries are constructed from rearranged V genes of IgM repertoires. Because the gene sequences are derived from B cells of human donors, the na\u00efve libraries are relatively close to the human antibody germ line and have a low risk of immunogenicity. The main advantage of an immunized library over a na\u00efve library is that antibody genes in the immunized library have undergone natural affinity maturation in vivo, allowing the development of high-affinity antibodies against the target. However, this approach requires that immunogenic response can be successfully induced by the antigen of interest, and new libraries must be prepared for each new target. Single large na\u00efve [94,104,105] and synthetic [102,106,107] libraries have yielded high affinity antibodies (sub-nanomolar range) against a wide spectrum of targets. Therefore,",

With respect to protein targets, antibodies have been selected with exquisite specificity, differentiating, for example, between chicken and quail lysozyme 68 that differ by a single surface amino acid, and the SH2 domains of ABL1 and ABL2 69 , 70 . Phage antibody libraries have been widely used to select antibodies against infectious agents. These include antibodies that discriminate between different strains of Hantavirus 71 , Dengue virus 72 , influenza 73 , 74 , Ebola 75 and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus 76 . Given that many of these viruses are classified serologically, the ability to select phage antibodies with similar specificities is not surprising, but unlike antibodies generated by immunization, these have the potential to be used therapeutically. Human antibodies, some of which are protective in animal models 77 , 78 , 79 , have also been selected against a number of bacterial biothreat targets, including Brucella melitensis 80 , Burkholderia mallei and Burkholderia pseudomallei 81 , anthrax toxins 77 , 82 , 83 and spores 84 , and Botulinum toxin 24 , 85 . One library 79 was generated from servicemen vaccinated against a plethora of different biothreat agents, reflecting the additional ability of display technologies to exploit antibodies generated during traditional immunization. \n\nThe in vitro nature of phage display technology has been exploited to target particular features of blood cells. In one study 36 , antibodies recognizing fetal hemoglobin but not adult hemoglobin, were selected by depleting high affinity cross-reactive antibodies followed by a selection against the fetal protein. Notably, the selected discriminatory antibody was of much lower affinity than cross-reactive antibodies, demonstrating the power of negative selections to favor clones with desirable binding specificities, even if their affinity is lower. Similar methods applied to cells have been used to select antibodies specifically recognizing fetal nucleated red blood cells 95 . \n\nProtein allostery is a common means for the regulation of protein function, and many signaling proteins exist in alternative conformational states that mediate different cellular responses.",

D\u00fcbel, J. McCafferty\n## Abstract\nIn vitro display technologies, best exemplified by phage and yeast display, were first described for the selection of antibodies some 20 years ago. Since then, many antibodies have been selected and improved upon using these methods. Although it is not widely recognized, many of the antibodies derived using in vitro display methods have properties that would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to obtain by immunizing animals. The first antibodies derived using in vitro display methods are now in the clinic, with many more waiting in the wings. Unlike immunization, in vitro display permits the use of defined selection conditions and provides immediate availability of the sequence encoding the antibody. The amenability of in vitro display to high-throughput applications broadens the prospects for their wider use in basic and applied research.\n## Specificity for protein sequences and conformations\nPhage display allows the generation of antibodies against nearly any target, including toxins, pathogens, non-immunogenic, or highly conserved antigens. With respect to protein targets, antibodies have been selected with exquisite specificity, differentiating, for example, between chicken and quail lysozyme 68 that differ by a single surface amino acid, and the SH2 domains of ABL1 and ABL2 69 , 70 . Phage antibody libraries have been widely used to select antibodies against infectious agents. These include antibodies that discriminate between different strains of Hantavirus 71 , Dengue virus 72 , influenza 73 , 74 , Ebola 75 and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus 76 . Given that many of these viruses are classified serologically, the ability to select phage antibodies with similar specificities is not surprising, but unlike antibodies generated by immunization, these have the potential to be used therapeutically. Human antibodies, some of which are protective in animal models 77 , 78 , 79 , have also been selected against a number of bacterial biothreat targets, including Brucella melitensis 80 , Burkholderia mallei and Burkholderia pseudomallei 81 , anthrax toxins 77 , 82 , 83 and spores 84 , and Botulinum toxin 24 , 85 . One library 79 was generated from servicemen vaccinated against a plethora of different biothreat agents, reflecting the additional ability of display technologies to exploit antibodies generated during traditional immunization. \n\nThe in vitro nature of phage display technology has been exploited to target particular features of blood cells. In one study 36 , antibodies recognizing fetal hemoglobin but not adult hemoglobin, were selected by depleting high affinity cross-reactive antibodies followed by a selection against the fetal protein. Notably, the selected discriminatory antibody was of much lower affinity than cross-reactive antibodies, demonstrating the power of negative selections to favor clones with desirable binding specificities, even if their affinity is lower. Similar methods applied to cells have been used to select antibodies specifically recognizing fetal nucleated red blood cells 95 . \n\nProtein allostery is a common means for the regulation of protein function, and many signaling proteins exist in alternative conformational states that mediate different cellular responses.",

            "abstract": "To combat the continued pandemic of COVID-19, multiplex serological assays have been developed to comprehensively monitor the humoral immune response and help to design new vaccination protocols to different SARS-CoV-2 variants. However, multiplex beads and stably transfected cell lines require stringent production and storage conditions, and assays based on flow cytometry is time-consuming and its application is therefore restricted. Here, we describe a phage display system to distinguish the differences of immune response to antigenic domains of multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants simultaneously. Compared with linear peptides, the recombinant antigens displayed on the phage surface have shown some function that requires the correct folding to form a stable structure, and the binding efficiency between the recombinant phage and existing antibodies is reduced by mutations on antigens known to be important for antigen\u2013antibody interaction. By using Phage display mediated immuno-multiplex quantitative PCR (Pi-mqPCR), the binding efficiency between the antibody and antigens of different SARS-CoV-2 variants can be measured in one amplification reaction. Overall, these data show that this assay is a valuable tool to evaluate the humoral response to the same antigen of different SARS-CoV-2 variants or antigens of different pathogens. Combined with high-throughput DNA sequencing technology, this phage display system can be further applied in monitoring humoral immune response in a large population before and after vaccination.",

                    "text": "In this study, we constructed a polyvalent antigen display system based on the M13 bacteriophage. We show here that the recombinant antigen could be displayed on the surface of the phage and identified by antibodies. Interestingly, we observed binding activity between ACE2 and the phage that displayed the RBD region of SARS-CoV-2. These data demonstrated that the phage-displayed antigen has properties similar to the protein found on the viral membrane. Based on this result, the phage-displayed antigen can be used not only to detect lineardirected antibodies but also in some research that requires the correct structure. For example, Uppalapati et al. (2022) reconstituted the receptor-binding motif (RBM) of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) by phagedisplay conformer libraries and selected two reconstituted RBM conformers that cross-reacted with a panel of 7 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. Combined with phage display selection, phage display antigen libraries can also be used to predict RBD constructs that have a higher affinity for ACE2. \n\nTo isolate biomolecules with high affinity, the dual plasmid helper phage display system has been used for phage display selection (Kumar et al., 2022); compared with this, the polyvalent display system can reduce nonspecific binding and has more advantages in diagnostic assays. In this research, our system could identify antibodies that target more than three antigens in the same multiplex real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR. Several studies have shown that serological assays based on multiple antigens can indeed increase the specificity of testing and provide a more comprehensive picture of the humoral immune response (Gillot et al., 2020). For example, the research of Grossberg et al. (Grossberg et al., 2021) showed that the antibody levels of S1-RBD IgA, NP IgG, and S2 IgA can be used to identify severe, mild, and asymptomatic groups of COVID-19 patients.",

Luo, Jianxun Wang\n## Abstract\nTo combat the continued pandemic of COVID-19, multiplex serological assays have been developed to comprehensively monitor the humoral immune response and help to design new vaccination protocols to different SARS-CoV-2 variants. However, multiplex beads and stably transfected cell lines require stringent production and storage conditions, and assays based on flow cytometry is time-consuming and its application is therefore restricted. Here, we describe a phage display system to distinguish the differences of immune response to antigenic domains of multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants simultaneously. Compared with linear peptides, the recombinant antigens displayed on the phage surface have shown some function that requires the correct folding to form a stable structure, and the binding efficiency between the recombinant phage and existing antibodies is reduced by mutations on antigens known to be important for antigen\u2013antibody interaction. By using Phage display mediated immuno-multiplex quantitative PCR (Pi-mqPCR), the binding efficiency between the antibody and antigens of different SARS-CoV-2 variants can be measured in one amplification reaction. Overall, these data show that this assay is a valuable tool to evaluate the humoral response to the same antigen of different SARS-CoV-2 variants or antigens of different pathogens. Combined with high-throughput DNA sequencing technology, this phage display system can be further applied in monitoring humoral immune response in a large population before and after vaccination.\n## Discussion\nIn this study, we constructed a polyvalent antigen display system based on the M13 bacteriophage. We show here that the recombinant antigen could be displayed on the surface of the phage and identified by antibodies. Interestingly, we observed binding activity between ACE2 and the phage that displayed the RBD region of SARS-CoV-2. These data demonstrated that the phage-displayed antigen has properties similar to the protein found on the viral membrane. Based on this result, the phage-displayed antigen can be used not only to detect lineardirected antibodies but also in some research that requires the correct structure. For example, Uppalapati et al. (2022) reconstituted the receptor-binding motif (RBM) of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) by phagedisplay conformer libraries and selected two reconstituted RBM conformers that cross-reacted with a panel of 7 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. Combined with phage display selection, phage display antigen libraries can also be used to predict RBD constructs that have a higher affinity for ACE2. \n\nTo isolate biomolecules with high affinity, the dual plasmid helper phage display system has been used for phage display selection (Kumar et al., 2022); compared with this, the polyvalent display system can reduce nonspecific binding and has more advantages in diagnostic assays. In this research, our system could identify antibodies that target more than three antigens in the same multiplex real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR. Several studies have shown that serological assays based on multiple antigens can indeed increase the specificity of testing and provide a more comprehensive picture of the humoral immune response (Gillot et al., 2020). For example, the research of Grossberg et al. (Grossberg et al., 2021) showed that the antibody levels of S1-RBD IgA, NP IgG, and S2 IgA can be used to identify severe, mild, and asymptomatic groups of COVID-19 patients.",

Bacteriophages are a useful alternative to antibodies in the detection of bacteria. For example, S. aureus was detected with an SPR sensor by using a lytic phage as the recognition element, and the detection limit was 10 4 CFU/mL [97]. \n\nPhage display technology is another tool for developing single-chain antibodies to bacteria. Phage-like antibodies have advantages such as in vitro production, a low cost, a low molecular weight, and high stability [98]. Phage display antibodies have been used to detect Listeria monocytogenes in an SPR biosensor (detection limit, 2 \u00d7 10 6 CFU/mL), which indicates the promise of non-antibody recognition elements [98]. \n\nIn the past few decades, SPR-based sensors have been used for the simultaneous detection of multiple analytes, but they are limited by the number of analytes. The use of multianalyte sensors will depend on the needs of specific applications. Primary applica- A known number of biorecognition elements are incubated and allowed to bind to the analyte in the sample. Then, the mixture is washed off the sensor surface, and unreacted biorecognition elements are fixed. In this case, the sensor response is inversely proportional to the analyte concentration. This approach increases the sensitivity of the assay but also increases the cost and time of analysis owing to the use of secondary antibodies and multistep manipulations. \n\nSPR-based immunosensors have great potential for the rapid detection of microorganisms in food and water samples. However, the detection limits achieved with these sensors cannot compete with those offered by traditional methods.",

Karavaeva, Andrey Smirnov, S. A. Eremin, V. Bunin\n## Abstract\nAnalytical devices for bacterial detection are an integral part of modern laboratory medicine, as they permit the early diagnosis of diseases and their timely treatment. Therefore, special attention is directed to the development of and improvements in monitoring and diagnostic methods, including biosensor-based ones. A promising direction in the development of bacterial detection methods is optical sensor systems based on colorimetric and fluorescence techniques, the surface plasmon resonance, and the measurement of orientational effects. This review shows the detecting capabilities of these systems and the promise of electro-optical analysis for bacterial detection. It also discusses the advantages and disadvantages of optical sensor systems and the prospects for their further improvement.\n## Sensors Based on the Surface Plasmon Resonance\nEfforts have been made to increase the sensitivity of immunosensors on the basis of the sandwich assay [91][92][93] and the subtractive inhibition assay (SIA) [94,95]. \n\nTo develop new biomolecular recognition elements with higher stabilities and higher affinities for target bacteria, researchers have recently integrated phage display with molecular imprinting in SPR biosensors [96]. Bacteriophages are a useful alternative to antibodies in the detection of bacteria. For example, S. aureus was detected with an SPR sensor by using a lytic phage as the recognition element, and the detection limit was 10 4 CFU/mL [97]. \n\nPhage display technology is another tool for developing single-chain antibodies to bacteria. Phage-like antibodies have advantages such as in vitro production, a low cost, a low molecular weight, and high stability [98]. Phage display antibodies have been used to detect Listeria monocytogenes in an SPR biosensor (detection limit, 2 \u00d7 10 6 CFU/mL), which indicates the promise of non-antibody recognition elements [98]. \n\nIn the past few decades, SPR-based sensors have been used for the simultaneous detection of multiple analytes, but they are limited by the number of analytes. The use of multianalyte sensors will depend on the needs of specific applications. Primary applica- A known number of biorecognition elements are incubated and allowed to bind to the analyte in the sample. Then, the mixture is washed off the sensor surface, and unreacted biorecognition elements are fixed. In this case, the sensor response is inversely proportional to the analyte concentration. This approach increases the sensitivity of the assay but also increases the cost and time of analysis owing to the use of secondary antibodies and multistep manipulations. \n\nSPR-based immunosensors have great potential for the rapid detection of microorganisms in food and water samples. However, the detection limits achieved with these sensors cannot compete with those offered by traditional methods.",

Antibodies were integrated in our medical repertoire against infectious diseases more than hundred years ago by using animal sera to treat tetanus and diphtheria. In these days, most developed therapeutic antibodies target cancer or autoimmune diseases. The COVID-19 pandemic was a reminder about the importance of antibodies for therapy against infectious diseases. While monoclonal antibodies could be generated by hybridoma technology since the 70ies of the former century, nowadays antibody phage display, among other display technologies, is robustly established to discover new human monoclonal antibodies. Phage display is an in vitro technology which confers the potential for generating antibodies from universal libraries against any conceivable molecule of sufficient size and omits the limitations of the immune systems. If convalescent patients or immunized/infected animals are available, it is possible to construct immune phage display libraries to select in vivo affinity-matured antibodies. A further advantage is the availability of the DNA sequence encoding the phage displayed antibody fragment, which is packaged in the phage particles. Therefore, the selected antibody fragments can be rapidly further engineered in any needed antibody format according to the requirements of the final application. In this review, we present an overview of phage display derived recombinant antibodies against bacterial, viral and eukaryotic pathogens, as well as microbial toxins, intended for diagnostic and therapeutic applications.",

            "text": "generation. This brought about various methods including phage display and other multiple display methods such as yeast display, ribosome display and mammalian cell display methods [14]. In addition, the use of transgenic animals was also introduced mainly with the xeno-mouse technology [11,13,14]. Even so, phage display is the preferred choice for recombinant antibody (rAb) production in most laboratories. Phage display allows for a faster and cost-effective solution towards antibody generation using Ff filamentous phage. In general, rAb production involves several steps including the generation of an antibody library, selection and enrichment of phage-displaying antibodies against specific antigens through the panning process, screening of monospecific antibodies and recombinant production of the antibodies via expression systems [15]. As phage-derived rAb may suffer from lower affinities, an additional stage of affinity maturation may be introduced to improve the antibodies produced. A major advantage to the use of phage display for rAb generation in contrast to conventional animal-derived methods is clearly the omission of animal use in the process. Another advantage of phage display is the lower downtime required for antibody production in between antigens. Conventional methods require immunization that may take up to weeks if not months to yield sufficient immune response for antibody production. This makes phage display rather efficient in the long term for antibody production process. However, one must acknowledge that phage-derived antibodies suffer from lower affinity when compared to conventional antibodies. This is due to the absence of affinity maturation in phage-derived antibodies as animal-derived antibodies are produced post maturation.\n\nThis chapter highlights monoclonal antibody development for diagnostic applications via phage display technology. This includes the different types of antibody libraries associated with antibody phage display. The chapter also highlights the different methods used to isolate antibodies against target antigens. The application of recombinant antibodies in different diagnostic platforms is also discussed briefly.",

In vitro selections by phage display facilitates the production of novel receptors beyond known biomolecular interactions, or against toxic or nonimmunogenic targets, or even using whole cells as the target. 1 Wild-type or genetically modified phages, as well as individual phages displaying a particular protein or peptide of interest, can be directly used as biorecognition elements as has been reported in a myriad of phage-based biosensors. 90,91 iosensors for pathogen detection can be based on the inherent ability of the phages to bind to their target",

            "text": "Antibody phage display is an in vitro screening technique that allows for rapid selection of multiple monoclonal antibodies of high affinity and specificity (Hoogenboom, 2005). It involves the display of a polyclonal collection of antibody fragments containing the variable regions, numbering up to 10 11 different clones, on the surface of filamentous phage carrying the genetic sequence of the displayed fragment. Antibody library repertoires can be obtained primarily by two methods, either from cDNA antibody sequences derived from the B cells of immunized or non-immune animal or human donors, or synthetically generated using random nucleotide sequences within selected CDRs (complementarity-determining regions) in combination with one or multiple framework regions to replicate the diversity of a natural antibody repertoire (Conrad and Scheller, 2005). These sequences are then fused to the sequence encoding the gene III (gIII) coat protein of the phage, enabling expression and incorporation of the antibody fragment on its surface. This collection of phage-displayed antibodies is then panned repeatedly against the antigen of interest, producing a polyclonal phage collection enriched for antigen-specific antibodies, from which individual monoclonal clones can then be identified and characterized. \n\nThe rapidity of this technique makes it ideal for generating novel antibodies for diagnostic and potentially therapeutic responses to outbreaks of emerging infectious disease such as SARS coronavirus and H5N1 Avian Influenza or genetically modified pathogens released in a bioterrorism incident. Since antibodies are highly specific and are capable of recognizing virtually every class of pathogen, including toxins, viruses, bacteria and fungi, they enable easy and rapid identification of pathogens (Nowakowski et al., 2002;Hayhurst et al., 2003;Paoli et al., 2004;Steiniger et al., 2007;Cabezas et al., 2008). Indeed, sandwich ELISAs utilizing high affinity mouse monoclonal antibodies have been developed against likely bioterrorist threats such as epsilon toxin of Clostridium botulinum and protective antigen, a toxin component of anthrax, with demonstrated toxin detection limits of 1-2 ng/ml (el Idrissi and Ward, 1992;Mabry et al., 2006).",

            "text": "Thus, between random peptide and recombinant antibody libraries hinges on the specific needs of the intended application, ensuring optimal results for cholera toxin detection. \n\nIn practical applications, the detection of cholera toxins often involves using fusion proteins formed by coupling random peptides with other proteins, rather than single peptides or phages alone. Multifunctional phage display technology has enabled the development of versatile biosensors based on M13 phage for detection and analysis. Through surface modifications, M13 phage gains new characteristics, such as targeted binding ability, optical properties of quantum dots, and the accumulation of magnetic nanoparticles (171). These modifications make M13 phage an ideal platform for highly sensitive and selective biosensor development in cholera toxins detection, offering improved accuracy and efficiency. In contrast to random peptides, recombinant antibodies possess the advantage of direct fixation on both solid surfaces and antigens. Isolated from libraries, recombinant antibodies like scFvs and anti-idiotype antibodies find applications in sensitive diagnosis techniques such as ELISA, PD-IPCR, and iLAMP. Additionally, recombinant antibodies expand the scope of immunoassay agents, allowing for the detection of diverse biotoxins within the same group. The use of recombinant antibodies has led to simultaneous biotoxin detection based on phage display, showcasing their advantages, including enhanced specificity, increased sensitivity, shorter detection time, and improved safety. Recombinant antibodies represent a potent tool for the sensitive and specific detection of cholera toxins. In the quest for cholera toxin screening, researchers harnessed diverse resources, including antigens for antibody preparation, proteins, and antibody samples for immunomolecular sieving. Antigens, derived from animals, triggered immune responses, resulting in specific antibodies. To enhance affinity, an animal immune repository was utilized, spotlighting antibodies finely tuned to the toxin. Nanobodies, from animals like camels, featured compact size, stability, and genetic manipulability, becoming potent alternatives to conventional antibodies. Nanobodies played crucial roles, particularly in targeted antibody selection, mimicking toxin epitopes for precise immune analyses, thus serving as high-affinity substitutes. This integrated approach supported effective cholera toxin detection and analysis (172).",

In this study, we demonstrated the power of a microarray-based technique for obtaining specific phage-derived antibody fragments against Salmonella, an important foodborne pathogen. The selected phage-displayed antibody fragments were subsequently employed to develop a lateral flow test strip assay for the detection of live Salmonella. The test strips showed specificity to Salmonella Enteritidis without cross-reactivity to eight serovars of Salmonella or other bacteria strains. The test strip assay requires 15 min, whereas the conventional biochemical and serological confirmation test requires at least 24 h.

            "text": "There are three general ways to use antibodies for diagnostics.The first way is the detection of antigens using antibodies [77] and the second, but reversed way is the detection of serum antibodies using antigens [78].The third way is the competition assay, here, e.g., antigens are detected by serum antibodies which compete with a defined antibody preparation [79].The advantage of an antibody competition assay is its species independence [80].Other prominent technologies used for diagnostics are lateral flow strip assays [81,82], bead based assays such as Luminex [83], flow cytometry [58,84], the hemagglutination assay [85], and more recently, the proximity ligation assay [86] or molecular imaging [87].An interesting diagnostic method is the direct use of phage particles fused to antibodies [88] for diagnostics.Sensitivity of the diagnostic assay can be enhanced by detection of the about 2700 copies of pVIII of an antibody phage by secondary antibodies [89,90].Antibody phage particles can also be used for immuno-PCR [91].\n\nTo date, there are many examples for the application of antibodies derived by phage display for diagnostics [92][93][94].A big advantage of antibody phage display for diagnostics is the direct access to the genetic information of the binder, allowing a fast adaption of the antibody format e.g., IgG, scFv-Fc, biotinylated antibody or scFv-phoA fusion [40] to the desired diagnostic assay.\n\nPhage display allows also the identification of immunogenic proteins, e.g., from pathogens [95][96][97].Combining antibody phage display with antigen phage display all steps from identification of antigens to the generation of antibodies against these antigens for diagnostics are available.",

Using phage display technology, single chain fragment variable (scFv) can be screened, replacing the disadvantage of the large size of traditional antibodies. Phage display single chain antibody libraries have significant biological implications.

            "text": "Phage display library may be constructed using any of the above-mentioned phage display systems and screened to obtain the most promising binders exhibiting strongest affinity for the target molecule/pathogen for use in diagnostics and immunotherapy. Either randomly generated fragments of targeted pathogen DNA or synthetic random degenerate oligonucleotide inserts are cloned into the phage genome leading to generation of Natural peptide library (NPL) or Random peptide library (RPL), respectively. NPLs are more likely to mount an antibody response that cross-reacts with the native intact pathogen but a vast majority of clones in these libraries are non-functional, whereas RPLs have extended range of displayed epitopes [37,38]. When the engineered nucleotide fragments of immunoglobulins encoding the antigen-binding region are displayed, it leads to generation of antibody phage display (APD) library. Antibody expression over the phage surface is a powerful platform that allows the selection of specific antibodies when either immunized patients are not available or immunization is not ethically feasible. Due to the vast applications of this important technique, Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the year 2018 was awarded to George P. Smith and Sir Gregory P. Winter for developing and applying the phage display technique for the discovery and isolation of antibodies [1,39,40]. Major advantages of antibody phage display include as follows: production of large-sized combinatorial libraries, improved efficiency than conventional hybridoma system, easy manipulation, safety, no involvement of animal cell culture, lower propagative cost and easy screening procedures involved to select target specific binders [41][42][43]. Specifically for viral pathogens, antibody phage display is an alternative tool to hybridoma technology, since it circumvents the limitations of the immune system [44].\n\nThe antibody phage display technique was first described using gene III protein of E. coli filamentous phages and was further modified. The display formats include single-chain fragment variable (scFv), antigen-binding fragment (Fabs), single-chain fabs (scFab), human VH domains (dAbs), variable domains of heavy chain (VHHs)-also called as nanobodies, immunoglobu",

            "text": "Diagnostic assays hampered by the lack of specificity caused by polyclonal capture and detection antibodies highlighted the need for more specific tests. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific reagents and are being used for a variety of research and diagnostic purposes within the FMD field and their pivotal role in all aspects of FMD research is now clear. However, traditional monoclonal antibodies, produced using hybridoma technology, and used in diagnostics have several limitations such as its high cost, time-consuming production, and the expertise required (32)(33)(34). \n\nThe development of large combinatorial antibody libraries based on antibody genes expressed and displayed on phages have revolutionized the selection and isolation of unique antibodies to an antigen and aided in the development of recombinant reagents for ELISA (35). A key advantage of phage display of antibody fragments is that the generation of specific singlechain variable fragment (scFv) or antigen binding fragment (Fab) to a particular antigen can be completed within a few weeks compared to hybridomas taking months. Antibody libraries can be either immune (from immunized donors) or na\u00efve (from non-immunized donors). An immune library will have an antibody range that is highly enriched for antibodies generated in response to a particular immunogen, whereas, the na\u00efve library can advantageously be used for an unlimited array of immunogens (36). \n\nPhage display libraries have been used with success to map epitopes for FMDV for serotype O (37,38) and the SAT2 serotype (25). The Nkuku R phage-display library, which is a large semisynthetic library of recombinant filamentous bacteriophages displaying scFv's derived from combinatorial pairings of chicken variable heavy and light chains, was used for this study (36). This na\u00efve library has been utilized to generate a variety of antibodies against antigens such as the bluetongue virus, African horse sickness virus, echovirus 1, coxsackievirus B3, FMDV of the SAT2 serotype as well as a mycobacterial 16 kDa antigen (25,36,(39)(40)(41)(42).",

Therefore, in this study, we compared the relative ability of a semi-synthetic scFv library and a natural nonimmune Fab library to generate useful diagnostic antibodies that can be converted and expressed as soluble recombinant antibodies to be used as a detection reagent. Our choice of antigens was two commonly cited bioterrorism threats, epsilon toxin (Etox) and protective antigen (PA). While screening of the scFv library produced multiple clones that bound as phage, only a small percentage of clones were successfully expressed as either soluble scFv or full-length IgG and retained specificity and functionality. On the other hand, screening of the Fab library produced multiple high affinity clones against Etox and PA, all of which functioned as soluble Fab. Upon conversion to full-length IgG, they were capable of sub-microgram levels of detection in a sandwich ELISA. Many of the synthetic scFv clones were found to contain amber stops in their CDRs or N-linked glycosylation sites. However, removal of these sequences did not render the majority of these clones amenable to expression as soluble recombinant antibody, suggesting that improper folding may also be a factor. The results of the study suggest that non-immune naturally derived antibody libraries may be preferable to synthetic scFv libraries for rapid isolation of antibodies against typical foreign or pathogenic protein antigens.",

            "text": "Accurate pathogen detection and diagnosis is paramount in clinical success of treating patients. There are two general paradigms in pathogen detection: molecular and immuno-based, and phage-based detection is a third emerging paradigm due to its sensitivity and selectivity. Molecular detection methods look for genetic material specific for a given pathogen in a sample usually by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Immuno-methods look at the pathogen components (antigens) by antibodies raised against that pathogen specific antigens. There are different variations and products based on these two paradigms with advantages and disadvantages. The third paradigm at least for bacterial pathogen detection entails bacteriophages specific for a given bacterium. Sensitivity and specificity are the two key parameters in any pathogen detection system. By their very nature, bacteriophages afford the best sensitivity for bacterial detection. Bacteria and bacteriophages form the predator-prey pair in the evolutionary arms race and has coevolved over time to acquire the exquisite specificity of the pair, in some instances at the strain level. This specificity has been exploited for diagnostic purposes of various pathogens of concern in clinical and other settings. Many recent reviews focus on phage-based detection and sensor technologies. In this review, we focus on a very special group of pathogens that are of concern in biodefense because of their potential misuse in bioterrorism and their extremely virulent nature and as such fall under the Centers for Disease and Prevention (CDC) Category A pathogen list. We describe the currently available phage methods that are based on the usual modalities of detection from culture, to molecular and immuno- and fluorescent methods. We further highlight the gaps and the needs for more modern technologies and sensors drawing from technologies existing for detection and surveillance of other pathogens of clinical relevance.",

Due to global warm-ing and rising temperatures worldwide, the rate of exposure to DENV is now reaching unprecedented levels, with over 400 million people getting infected each year. Despite worldwide attention to DENV, there is not currently an effective treatment or vaccine. Here, we focused on developing an antibody for the NS1 protein of the DENV, which enables earlier detection of disease and could further decrease the rate of death. Our study utilized a method more time-saving and cost-effective than the traditional method of extracting antibodies from the blood or B-cells of infected animals that show immu-nity: Phage Display. This technique allowed us to derive monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from the genome library and select DENV antibodies that bind to antigen proteins. In this study, we used Phage Display to select ninety-six potential antibodies from three phases of panning, which then went through indirect ELISA screening for optical density (OD) confirmation (OD > 1.5). Sixteen of the high optical density antibodies were sent to a DNA sequencing analysis facility where fifteen of them were revealed to be the same 1G1 strain. By understanding how antibodies are discovered using phage display technology, we hope to advance the field with reevaluation of current vaccines and the development of novel ones.",

            "text": "The selection of antibody fragments from phage display libraries thus offers the potential to access very large numbers of molecules with different binding specificities quickly and cheaply, avoiding the need for animal immunizations. The scFv can be genetically engineered to produce tailored constructs as described above. Such phage antibodies can be coated directly onto metal, plastic, silica or carbon surfaces by simple adsorption, which, as discussed above, is adequate for biosensor-based assays. \n\nViruses are pervasive life forms that need a host to reproduce. From bacteria to plants and animals to viruses, a wide variety of organisms may become infected. The genome, which is represented by double-or single-stranded DNA or RNA, and the capsid are the two primary structural parts of viruses. A small number of proteins encoded by the viral genome are present in numerous copies to create the extremely symmetrical capsid [216]. Methods for virus detection are employed in contemporary virological research for a variety of applications. They can be used in epidemiology to track and manage pandemic outbreaks of illnesses caused by viruses, including swine flu, SARS-CoV-2, and many others. Diagnostic virus detection methods are central in controlling the spread of viruses and help contain viral infections. Despite its drawbacks, the use of PCR to identify particular viral genomic sequences while an infection is still active is still regarded as the best virus detection technique. However, sensor technologies using phage antibodies as sensitive elements are very promising because antibodies generated by phage display are an excellent alternative to classical antibodies. Since its development in 1985, phage display has been a crucial and successful molecular biology technique that has remained essential for the scientific community. A phage library may include millions, or perhaps billions, of distinct and distinctive mapping peptide ligands because a huge number of nucleotide fragments can be cloned into the phage genome. The epitope mapping and antigen presentation on the bacteriophage surface, which constitute the basis for phage display, have been exploited in affinity selection-based biopanning to screen for potential novel vaccine candidates [77]. \n\nPhage display is a powerful tool for target ligand selection owing to its being simple, highly effective, rapid, and cheap.",

The success of mAb is due to their high versatility, high target specificity, excellent clinical safety profile, and efficacy. Antibody discovery, the most upstream stage of the antibody development pipeline, plays a pivotal role in determination of the clinical outcome of an mAb product. Phage display technology, originally developed for peptide directed evolution, has been extensively applied to discovery of fully human antibodies due to its unprecedented advantages. The value of phage display technology has been proven by a number of approved mAbs, including several top-selling mAb drugs, derived from the technology. Since antibody phage display was first established over 30\u2009years ago, phage display platforms have been developed to generate mAbs targeting difficult-to-target antigens and tackle the drawbacks present in in vivo antibody discovery approaches. More recently, the new generation of phage display libraries have been optimized for discovery of mAbs with \u201ddrug-like\u201d properties. This review will summarize the principles of antibody phage display and design of three generations of antibody phage display libraries.",

            "text": "Infectious diseases are a matter of national security and may have a great impact on public health and the world economy, especially due to rapid dissemination and adaptation of pathogens. Proper diagnosis of infectious diseases with reliable, robust and sensitive tests is very important for individual health, but is also crucial for surveillance and control of infectious diseases worldwide. One possible diagnosis of infectious diseases is the detection of pathogen-specific antibodies in the blood or serum of patients. Phages are very appropriate for the development of these antibody detection tests. Peptide phages displaying a peptide that mimics the antigen (mimitope) and binds to antigen-specific antibodies, can be selected. Peptide phage display is already widely used for epitope mapping of poly-and monoclonal antibodies (Irving et al. 2001). However, the selected peptide phages that bind to pathogen specific antibodies in these studies can also be used in diagnostic tests to detect these pathogen-specific antibodies. Goulart et al. (2008) developed a phage-particle gel immunoassay (PPaGIA), which uses polystyrene beads conjugated with peptide phages with affinity for pathogen-specific antibodies. When pathogen-specific antibodies are present in blood or serum of infected patients they will bind to the beads conjugated with these peptide phages. These antibody-bead complexes can be separated by size from the beads that do not interact with the antibodies, by centrifuging through a gel matrix of chromatographic microcolumns. When antibody-bead complexes are formed, they are captured at the top of the column, in contrast with plain beads that will be detected at the bottom of the column after centrifuging. An example of leismaniasis diagnosis with PPaGIA is visualised in Fig. 4.",

Besides, M13 filamentous phages, which have \u223c2700 copies of the 5 kD major pVIII coat protein, can provide great signal amplification when using reporter-conjugated anti-M13 pVIII antibodies. Various studies have shown that M13 phages are valuable reporter elements for use in ELISAs (Goldman, Anderson, Bernstein, & Swain, 2010). In addition, for increasing sensitivity, chemiluminescence has been employed to combine phage-displayed nanobodies, HRP-conjugated anti-M13 pVIII antibodies and chemiluminescent substrates. In further studies, phages could be directly conjugated to a fluorescent dye or other label to improve the detection sensitivity and shorten the procedure. Meanwhile, the affinity of nanobody P2 could be improved by site-directed mutagenesis of key amino acids in CDR3.",

            "text": "Fast and reliable detection of bacterial pathogens in clinical samples, contaminated food products, and water supplies can drastically improve clinical outcomes and reduce the socio-economic impact of disease. As natural predators of bacteria, bacteriophages (phages) have evolved to bind their hosts with unparalleled specificity and to rapidly deliver and replicate their viral genome. Not surprisingly, phages and phage-encoded proteins have been used to develop a vast repertoire of diagnostic assays, many of which outperform conventional culture-based and molecular detection methods. While intact phages or phage-encoded affinity proteins can be used to capture bacteria, most phage-inspired detection systems harness viral genome delivery and amplification: to this end, suitable phages are genetically reprogrammed to deliver heterologous reporter genes, whose activity is typically detected through enzymatic substrate conversion to indicate the presence of a viable host cell. Infection with such engineered reporter phages typically leads to a rapid burst of reporter protein production that enables highly sensitive detection. In this review, we highlight recent advances in infection-based detection methods, present guidelines for reporter phage construction, outline technical aspects of reporter phage engineering, and discuss some of the advantages and pitfalls of phage-based pathogen detection. Recent improvements in reporter phage construction and engineering further substantiate the potential of these highly evolved nanomachines as rapid and inexpensive detection systems to replace or complement traditional diagnostic approaches.",

            "text": "ABSTRACT: Dengue virus (DENV) is a type of flavivirus transmitted globally by the Aedes aegypti mosquito and is the causal agent of Dengue fever. Due to global warming and rising temperatures worldwide, the rate of exposure to DENV is now reaching unprecedented levels, with over 400 million people getting infected each year. Despite worldwide attention to DENV, there is not currently an effective treatment or vaccine. Here, we focused on developing an antibody for the NS1 protein of the DENV, which enables earlier detection of disease and could further decrease the rate of death. Our study utilized a method more time-saving and cost-effective than the traditional method of extracting antibodies from the blood or B-cells of infected animals that show immunity: Phage Display. This technique allowed us to derive monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from the genome library and select DENV antibodies that bind to antigen proteins. In this study, we used Phage Display to select ninety-six potential antibodies from three phases of panning, which then went through indirect ELISA screening for optical density (OD) confirmation (OD > 1.5). Sixteen of the high optical density antibodies were sent to a DNA sequencing analysis facility where fifteen of them were revealed to be the same 1G1 strain. By understanding how antibodies are discovered using phage display technology, we hope to advance the field with reevaluation of current vaccines and the development of novel ones. gathered by well-known organizations such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Their statistics reveal a dramatic increase in the incidence rate of Dengue in recent decades with over 400 million infections, 100 million people showing symptoms, and 22,000 deaths each year [2]. While 22,000 deaths alone are not a statistic to be ignored, we must also watch out for the symptoms of Dengue fever. Most people who are infected by DENV recover within 2 -7 days, accompanied by mild symptoms including nausea, vomiting, and rash. However, severe dengue can result in severe internal bleeding and organ impairment [2].\n\nIn order to prevent such symptoms and casualties, it is imperative to diagnose the disease quickly and precisely.

            "text": "To bypass the limitations in polyclonal and monoclonal antibody generation, several groups have turned to in vitro display technologies such as phage display, ribosome display, or yeast display libraries to generate recombinant antibodies. The more recent technologies of yeast and ribosome display are becoming highly established, but phage display is currently the most robust, well characterized, and reliable of these methods. Antibodies derived from these technologies are cloned in microbial hosts and are therefore monoclonal from the start, with their production being easily scaled up. Critically, selection and screening efforts can be directed toward specifi c epitopes or species cross-reactivity and away from polyspecifi c binding. Phage display allows a researcher to do in a single tube what would be unfathomable in traditional hybridoma work: interrogate libraries of millions to tens of billions of antibodies on the basis of their binding specifi cally to a target of interest. \n\nAll of this is possible due to the ingenious concept of \"genotypeto-phenotype linkage,\" which is exemplifi ed by phage display. Phage display was originally described as a rapid method for cloning gene fragments that encode a specifi c protein [ 5 ]. By cloning gene fragments into the genome of a fi lamentous E. coli bacteriophage, Smith et al. were able to generate libraries of gene fusions with the key phage coat protein p3. After transformation into E. coli , the viral replication system packaged the genome (and therefore the cloned gene) into a highly stable complex carrying the gene product on the tip of the phage particle, as a fusion protein with p3 . By subsequently selecting expressed virions on an immobilized antibody with specifi city for a known protein that had been cloned in the phage genome, they were able to show 1000-fold enrichment of the gene product. This set of experiments showed that \"genotypeto-phenotype linkage\" could be achieved and thereby defi ned the basis of all display technologies developed since.",

Further investigations found that phage display derived therapeutic antibodies have higher self-interaction and poly-reactivity due to the higher percentage of aliphatic residues in their CDRs compared to the non-phage derived antibodies (112). \n\nAdditionally, antibodies selected form phage display libraries are not glycosylated, because they are produced in E. coli, as a result, some candidates when glycosylation occur during mammalian cells expression; their binding, biodistribution, or pharmacokinetics might be negatively impacted (113)(114)(115)(116). Therefore, using eukaryotic display platforms like yeast and mammalian display would be beneficial. For instance, in addition to their ability to produce glycosylated proteins, yeast and mammalian antibody libraries can be constructed to display fulllength antibodies as well as antibody fragments, such as scFvs and fragment antigen-binding region (Fabs) (117)(118)(119)(120)(121)(122)(123)(124)(125)(126), allowing the isolation of high affinity antibodies with definitive biological characteristics (122,123). For example, Parthiban et al. has developed mammalian libraries that display around 10 million clones in IgG-format on the surface of HEK293 cells using CRISPR/Cas9 or transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) (127). These libraries can act as a quality filter for different antibody developability aspects, and to provide a very early insight into developability problems, such as aggregation and cross-reactivity. Each display system has its advantages and disadvantages, however, determining those are beyond the intended scope of this review, which is about the most commonly used type of antibody display, the phage display. Therefore, it is vital to generate phage libraries that allow for the isolation of highly specific and diverse mAbs with high affinity against diverse antigens with optimal developability potential (128)(129)(130).",

            "text": "However, the detection limits achieved with these sensors cannot compete with those offered by traditional methods. Efforts have been made to increase the sensitivity of immunosensors on the basis of the sandwich assay [91][92][93] and the subtractive inhibition assay (SIA) [94,95]. \n\nTo develop new biomolecular recognition elements with higher stabilities and higher affinities for target bacteria, researchers have recently integrated phage display with molecular imprinting in SPR biosensors [96]. Bacteriophages are a useful alternative to antibodies in the detection of bacteria. For example, S. aureus was detected with an SPR sensor by using a lytic phage as the recognition element, and the detection limit was 10 4 CFU/mL [97]. \n\nPhage display technology is another tool for developing single-chain antibodies to bacteria. Phage-like antibodies have advantages such as in vitro production, a low cost, a low molecular weight, and high stability [98]. Phage display antibodies have been used to detect Listeria monocytogenes in an SPR biosensor (detection limit, 2 \u00d7 10 6 CFU/mL), which indicates the promise of non-antibody recognition elements [98]. \n\nIn the past few decades, SPR-based sensors have been used for the simultaneous detection of multiple analytes, but they are limited by the number of analytes. The use of multianalyte sensors will depend on the needs of specific applications. Primary applications of such sensors include pharmaceutical research (high-throughput drug screening systems), medical diagnostics (high-throughput diagnostic tools), food safety (systems for the rapid detection of pathogens and foodborne agents), and security (devices for the early detection and identification of biological warfare and chemical agents) [70]. \n\nIn SPR-based sensors, molecular imprinting technology is as effective as antibody-or phage-based technology. Idil et al. (2021) described a variation in the SPR-based sensor that uses micro-contact imprinted chips to detect S. aureus within the range 1.0 \u00d7 10 2 -2.0 \u00d7 10 5 CFU/mL.",

            "text": "Over the past decades, monoclonal antibodies have found tremendous applications in drug targeting, therapeutics and had a significant impact on diagnostics. This is due to their restricted feature that only recognizes a unique antigenic determinant (epitope) on pathogens. Thus, this allows for precise identification of the target organism which is the prime advantage over polyclonal based detection.\n\nThere are a number of studies that have reported the benefit of monoclonal antibodies in the detection of infectious diseases. Among the reported pathogens are Trichomonas vaginalis [31], Leishmania donovani [32], Trypanosoma congolense [33], and Babesia bovis [34]. Monoclonal antibody-based systems also have been employed for detection of animal viruses such as bovine herpes virus, cervine herpes virus type I, pseudo rabies virus, calf strain RIT 4237 (sub-group I) and human strain 82-561 (sub group 3) of rotavirus [35][36][37].\n\nPhage display technology has been the most widely used method to isolate monoclonal antibodies [38]. The robustness and high stability of phages have allowed this technology to gain popularity over other isolation technologies. In this study, a previously established helminth antibody phage library was utilized. It was expected to isolate antibodies against proteins from other nematodes since homology among their proteins is expected. The B. malayi scFv phage display library was previously used to isolate antibodies against several parasite antigens, i.e., two filarial antigens, BmSXP [22] and BmR1 [23], Echinococcus granulosus antigen B [24], and S. stercoralis NIE antigen [25]. In the present study, novel recombinant monoclonal antibodies were isolated against a T. canis recombinant antigen using the same library. Initially, BLAST analysis of the rTES-26 antigen sequence was performed against B. malayi sequences to determine the extent of sequence identity and whether B. malayi express TES-26-like proteins. The results showed that at the nucleotide level, both sequences showed no significant similarity; however, some similarities",

            "text": "Over the past decades, monoclonal antibodies have found tremendous applications in drug targeting, therapeutics and had a significant impact on diagnostics. This is due to their restricted feature that only recognizes a unique antigenic determinant (epitope) on pathogens. Thus, this allows for precise identification of the target organism which is the prime advantage over polyclonal based detection.\n\nThere are a number of studies that have reported the benefit of monoclonal antibodies in the detection of infectious diseases. Among the reported pathogens are Trichomonas vaginalis [31], Leishmania donovani [32], Trypanosoma congolense [33], and Babesia bovis [34]. Monoclonal antibody-based systems also have been employed for detection of animal viruses such as bovine herpes virus, cervine herpes virus type I, pseudo rabies virus, calf strain RIT 4237 (sub-group I) and human strain 82-561 (sub group 3) of rotavirus [35][36][37].\n\nPhage display technology has been the most widely used method to isolate monoclonal antibodies [38]. The robustness and high stability of phages have allowed this technology to gain popularity over other isolation technologies. In this study, a previously established helminth antibody phage library was utilized. It was expected to isolate antibodies against proteins from other nematodes since homology among their proteins is expected. The B. malayi scFv phage display library was previously used to isolate antibodies against several parasite antigens, i.e., two filarial antigens, BmSXP [22] and BmR1 [23], Echinococcus granulosus antigen B [24], and S. stercoralis NIE antigen [25]. In the present study, novel recombinant monoclonal antibodies were isolated against a T. canis recombinant antigen using the same library. Initially, BLAST analysis of the rTES-26 antigen sequence was performed against B. malayi sequences to determine the extent of sequence identity and whether B. malayi express TES-26-like proteins. The results showed that at the nucleotide level, both sequences showed no significant similarity; however, some similarities",

            "text": "Flaviviruses are a large family of viruses, some members of which cause human and veterinary disease and pose a potential risk of death. The transmission route is typically through the bite of arthropods such as ticks or mosquitoes and. They are a major cause of emerging and re-emerging viral infections. One of the major issues faced when carrying out serology diagnostics is the risk of cross reactive antibodies among closely related species. Next Generation Phage Display is a molecular biology technique combines phage display with next generation sequencing. A phage library is created by inserting peptide sequences into a phagemid vector. Each phage in the resultant library displays a particular peptide on its external surface and the resultant phagemid is packaged within the phage particle. The main advantage of phage display is linking the phenotype (peptide binding properties) with genotype (the peptide gene within the phagemid) Serum antibodies from flavivirus infected species are immobilised on a solid support and incubated with the phage library. Following washing steps to remove non-specific binding, the phage are rescued and propagated in bacteria. This process is called biopanning and is repeated up to 4 times. The phage genomes are sequenced using Ion Torrent sequencing and through analysing the sequences, the antigenic peptide regions can be identified. The most antigenically potent sites can then be used to create a diagnostic assay such an ELISA.",

These antibodies are mainly derived from two types of sources: immune, or na\u00efve libraries.

If immunization is not possible or ethically not feasible, na\u00efve antibody gene libraries are an alternative.

Phage-like antibodies have advantages such as in vitro production, a low cost, a low molecular weight, and high stability [98]. Phage display antibodies have been used to detect Listeria monocytogenes in an SPR biosensor (detection limit, 2 \u00d7 10 6 CFU/mL), which indicates the promise of non-antibody recognition elements [98]. \n\nIn the past few decades, SPR-based sensors have been used for the simultaneous detection of multiple analytes, but they are limited by the number of analytes.

Competitive assays are typically used to detect low concentrations of analytes whose binding to surface-immobilized recognition molecules does not produce a measurable sensor response. In the binding inhibition assay (Figure 12), analyte molecules or their derivatives are fixed to the sensor surface [71]. A known number of biorecognition elements are incubated and allowed to bind to the analyte in the sample. Then, the mixture is washed off the sensor surface, and unreacted biorecognition elements are fixed. In this case, the sensor response is inversely proportional to the analyte concentration. This approach increases the sensitivity of the assay but also increases the cost and time of analysis owing to the use of secondary antibodies and multistep manipulations. \n\nSPR-based immunosensors have great potential for the rapid detection of microorganisms in food and water samples. However, the detection limits achieved with these sensors cannot compete with those offered by traditional methods. Efforts have been made to increase the sensitivity of immunosensors on the basis of the sandwich assay [91][92][93] and the subtractive inhibition assay (SIA) [94,95].",

Neither are other in vitro alternatives such as cell surface display (mammalian, yeast or bacterial) or ribosome display feasible due to their lower resistance to high temperatures or extreme pH. Phage can tolerate temperatures of up to 60\u00b0C and a pH range of 2-11 (98). Table 1 provides a summary comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of these various in vitro techniques. \n\nPhage display is also likely to remain useful for discovery of antibodies against non-protein targets, evolution of dual-binding antibodies and for affinity maturation, due to the limitations of the natural immune system. However, antibodies against non-protein targets such as lipids and carbohydrates remain a fairly unexplored area, partially due to the lack of validated therapeutic targets aside from bacterial membrane surface carbohydrates. One area that could be of particular interest is lipids involved in autoimmune and neurodegenerative disorders, for which there is some evidence that antibodies could have both protective and pathological roles and which a therapeutic antibody designed to suppress immune function, e.g. of the IgG4 isotype, could have benefits. \n\nFor regular protein antigens, there may still be one particular niche for phage display based on its strengths: the rapid development of therapeutic antibodies against emerging diseases or a genetically modified pathogen in an emergency situation. Antibodies are a natural and well-studied component of the immune system and use of a naturally derived antibody should have minimal side effects and thus be ideal for emergency use. In such a situation, rapid antibody isolation is critical. Phage display allows for the screening of an extremely large collection of antibodies of up to 10 11 sequences, far more than that possible by Next Generation sequencing or single B-cell analysis, thus improving the chance of isolating rare antibodies.",

            "text": "Medical manifestations of disease, confirmed by biochemical, microbiological, and animal tests, remain the gold standard in clinical diagnostic laboratories. Currently, new requirements for fast, sensitive, accurate, and inexpensive detection platforms devalue the traditional detection methods. Modern immunoassays and biosensors require a biorecognition probe, which is attached to the interface of the analytical device, binding the target biological or chemical threat agent and generating a measurable signal. Most analytic platforms rely on the use of monoclonal antibodies as biorecognition probes. However, their broad application is limited by high cost, low specificity, less-than-optimal affinity, and sensitivity to environmental stresses. Landscape-phage display is a novel concept that allows for the development of diagnostic and detection interfaces that meet modern criteria for biological detection and monitoring [20,21,49,52,57]. It was proved that the landscape libraries represent an inexhaustible rich source of substitute antibodies-filaments that bind protein and glycoprotein antigens with nanomolar affinities and high specificity [49]. Landscape-phage-based interfaces performed in many ways much more effectively than their natural immunoglobulin counterparts in the same detector platforms. Target-specific landscape-phage probes can be prepared as described in commonly available protocols [58,59]. In my laboratory, Bacillus anthracis spore-specific landscape phages were selected by incubation of the landscape-phage library with spores immobilized in wells of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plates. Non-related phage particles were discarded, and spore-bound particles were released with acid buffer and collected [60]. To discover phage probes against the bacteria Salmonella typhimurium, a similar panning procedure was used, along with a coprecipitation procedure, in which complexes of bacterial cells and phage particles were isolated by centrifugation [61]. After titering of the phage in the host E. coli strain, random phage clones were used for the identification of selected displayed peptides by sequencing of recombinant gpVIII DNA [61].",

            "text": "Generation of sequence defined antibodies from universal libraries by phage display has been established over the past three decades as a robust method to cope with the increasing market demand in therapy, diagnostics and research. For applications requiring the bivalent antigen binding and an Fc part for detection, phage display generated single chain Fv (scFv) antibody fragments can rapidly be genetically fused to the Fc moiety of an IgG for the production in eukaryotic cells of antibodies with IgG-like properties. In contrast to conversion of scFv into IgG format, the conversion to scFv-Fc requires only a single cloning step, and provides significantly higher yields in transient cell culture production than IgG. ScFv-Fcs can be effective as neutralizing antibodies in vivo against a panel of pathogens and toxins. However, different scFv fragments are more heterologous in respect of stability than Fab fragments. While some scFv fragments can be made extremely stable, this may change due to few mutations, and is not predictable from the sequence of a newly selected antibody. To mitigate the necessity to assess the stability for every scFv-Fc antibody, we developed a generic lyophilization protocol to improve their shelf life. We compared long-term stability and binding activity of phage display-derived antibodies in the scFv-Fc and IgG format, either stored in liquid or lyophilized state. Conversion of scFv-Fcs into the full IgG format reduced protein degradation and aggregation, but in some cases compromised binding activity. Comparably to IgG conversion, lyophilization of scFv-Fc resulted in the preservation of the antibodies\u2019 initial properties after storage, without any drop in affinity for any of the tested antibody clones.",

            "text": "Furthermore, the clinical signs vary significantly among different species and individual animals [9]. Therefore, early and accurate diagnosis is a key factor for preventing the transmission of the virus from an affected farm to other herds, particularly in the absence of a universal vaccine for all FMDV serotypes. In addition, the quasispecies nature of FMDV leads to the generation of viral populations with distinct antigenic properties, and therefore it poses challenges for the development of diagnostic tools. In most cases, monoclonal antibodies are essential precursors required to improve the performance of diagnostic assays such as ELISA or chromatographic strip tests. \n\nThe phage display technique is widely used for epitope identification due to its cost-effectiveness and rapidity. The technique is based on the direct linkage between the genotype and phenotype of bacteriophages, in which a genetic modification of phage DNA combined with a gene encoding peptide is able to display a peptide on the surface of the bacteriophage. In the phage display technique, panning of the random peptide libraries against a specified target can identify mimotopes, which mimic the particular epitope structures, but are not completely identical to the corresponding epitopes, yet can elicit the specific antibody responses to their cognate epitopes [10]. Previously, Wang and colleagues [11] used the phage display techniques to identify the epitopes recognized by monoclonal antibodies raised against different serotypes of FMDV. In this approach, a monoclonal antibody was immobilized on the solid surface for bio-panning against peptide libraries. They successfully identified a neutralizing epitope with the amino acid sequence 141 SXRGXLXXLXRR 152 , on the G-H loop of the VP1 protein of FMDV serotype Asia1. In another study, the consensus motif GDLNVRT was identified as a linear neutralizing epitope in the highly conserved residues of the VP1 protein of FMDV serotype O using a 12-mer random peptide phage display library [12], whereas a consensus motif ETTXLE which was closed to conserved residues at the N-terminus of the VP2 protein of FMDV was also characterized [13].",

This technology has enabled the development of phage ELISA for antibody detection, biosensors for rapid pathogen identification, and peptide arrays for comprehensive biomarker screening [180]. The inherent signal amplification capacity of phages enhances their in situ detection and facilitates the identification of disease-specific bacterial markers. Moreover, phage-derived proteins hold promise for imaging and targeted drug delivery, thus advancing diagnostics and personalized medicine [181]. This adaptable tool fuels innovative strategies for disease detection and the exploration of biomarkers. Once engineered, these modified phages are useful in diverse diagnostic applications, offering sensitive and precise detection of disease-related entities in clinical samples, ranging from minute targets such as viruses to substantial entities such as cancer cells (Table 1) [182][183][184][185][186]. \n\nAnand et al. comprehensively outlined the application of phage displays for diagnosing coronaviruses [187]. Phage engineering has facilitated novel target exploration through epitope mapping, shedding light on interactions between coronaviruses, human cell receptors, and other molecules. Li et al. developed a method for detecting virus particles at levels lower than the minimum infective dose, such as 10 5 copies/mL [188]. Similarly, Soendergaard et al. identified an optimal peptide for ovarian cancer diagnosis, enabling the direct application of radioactive indium ( 111 In) labeling for conventional SPECT/CT instrumentation [189]. The use of M13 phages as detection probes provides an additional diagnostic avenue. Ferreira et al. employed an M13 phage display platform to visualize colorectal cancer cells via specific MCT1 marker binding [190]. Lee et al. encoded a lungcancer-targeting peptide, Pep-1, on M13 phages, enabling non-invasive live in vivo imaging with a near-infrared microscope [191]. Salles et al. ingeniously mimicked a Leishmania infantum epitope using an M13 phage display, achieving 100% specificity and sensitivity for diagnosing human visceral leishmaniasis [192].",

            "text": "The phage display technique has been widely used to engineer the scFv antibody in various applications such as research, diagnostics, and therapeutic applications, and it offers several advantages over the hybridoma technology. In this technique, phages are constructed easily and cheaply by directly infecting E. coli (Wang et al. 1995), and these phages are more stable and can be stored at 4 \u00b0C for several years (Burritt et al. 1996). This study is the first to successfully clone and express the phage scFv library against FgCathL1H. The spleen of an immunized mouse was removed for the development of novel functional combinatorial antibodies that were expressed on the surface of bacteriophages. In previous studies, the scFv fragment of anti-F. hepatica cathepsin was generated from spleen cells (naive mouse) using phage techniques (Norbury et al. 2019b). The scFv fragment was ligated into the pCOMB3X phagemid vector and transformed into competent E. coli XL1-Blue cells. In other studies (Zhu et al. 2013), the scFv was produced from the hybridoma cell 6E6 that secretes the monoclonal antibody against the S protein of the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus. Moreover, the vector pGEX-6p-1 with a GST tag was used to generate rMoAbs and was expressed in E. coli using prokaryotic expression. When this study was compared with previous studies, it was evident that the phage display technique is a flexible method for creating antibodies against various targets, from viral proteins to parasitic antigens (such as F. hepatica and F. gigantica). This study also highlights the potential of the phage display technique to develop antibodies for diagnosing neglected tropical diseases, which have been often overlooked in antibody development. Several factors can affect the performance of the ScFv as a diagnostic antibody, including interference from host serum factors (e.g., serum proteins), its own stability (temperature, pH, storage conditions), and its binding affinity and specificity to the target antigen.",

            "text": "In the late 1980's, the expansion of molecular biology methods and DNA cloning also allowed the development of innovative ways to produce synthetic antibodies. Phage display technology is a recombinant technique for the screening and selection of recombinant paratopes against a desired compound (McCafferty et al., 1990). Unlike traditional antibody production, which uses the host system for antibody selection, this approach requires potential binders to be expressed and presented on the surface of a phage (bacterial virus; most commonly the M13 phage). A library of DNA sequences of vFc fragments are cloned into a phagemid vector and the fragment is then expressed in fusion with one of the phage capsid proteins (Figure 1, Nissim et al., 1994). Several rounds of panning steps with an immobilized antigen and E. coli host reinfection can allow selection of the strongest and most specific binders. In terms of advantages, this method of production can be targeted against any molecule. It is a valuable second choice when classical antibody production is unsuccessful due to a low immunological response in the host. Finally, the use of phage display has a strong bioethical advantage over classical antibody production as it does not use laboratory animals.\n\nHowever, the current selection of reported phage displaybased probes is not yet extensive. The CCRC-R1 phage was the first attempt to overcome the low immunogenicity of RG-II (Williams et al., 1996), and was followed by the better known and more widely used PAM1, which recognizes long stretches of HG lacking ester groups (more than 30) (Willats et al., 1999(Willats et al., , 2000. Other phage display-generated probes include B3 (anti-carrageenan) (Liners et al., 2005), XD3 [anti-(1\u2192 4)-\u03b2-Dgalactan], and XD27 (anti-AGP) (Shinohara et al., 2015). One of the main disadvantages of the phage display approach is that the panning selection requires the binding of whole phage particles (see Figure 1 dashed square for size comparison to mAbs) and, therefore,",

            "text": "A large number of recombinant antibodies for application in diagnostics and therapy were already generated by phage display against viral, bacterial and eukaryotic pathogens as well as toxins. Antibody phage display allows the generation of antibodies originating from several species, including human, camel, llama, alpaca, chimpanzee, macaque, pig, mice, chicken or shark. These antibodies are derived from two types of library  sources: immune or universal libraries. Immune libraries are preferred when convalescent patients or immunized animals/ human donors are available. This approach offers the advantage to directly isolate affinity matured antibodies. Universal antibody gene libraries offer an alternative if immunization is not possible, ethically not feasible or patient samples are not available. \n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic should teach us to be prepared for the next pandemic, which beyond any doubt will come. We need permanent preparedness platforms which will react on novel pathogens arising worldwide and provide antibodies for diagnostics and as potential therapeutic lead candidates. This preparedness platforms should also have a budget for immediate start of GMP production and clinical phase I/II studies. In the most cases, new pathogens may have only a local impact, but this cannot be assured. Also these antibodies are always valuable tools for research and diagnostics of the pathogens. \n\nWe do not build a fire department when the house is already burning, we need to establish it in advance and maintain this service also in times without emergency. We have to think in the same way about infectious diseases and potential pandemics.",

The biopanning regime employed subtraction biopanning against L. innocua, the strain genetically closest to L. monocytogenes [26], in the hope that this would increase the probability of identifying L. monocytogenes-specific binders.

In this way, MAbs emerged as the main biological drugs for this purpose. Moreover, MAbs play an important role in the development of serological diagnostic test that could be used for tracking the spread of disease and determining public health prevention measures and clinical care. There are still great questions around the infection mechanisms by flavivirus, especially related to the cross-reactivity between them and the risk of complications.

Some of the main advantages that make this technology so promising are the possibility to obtain human MAbs without in vivo immunization; the enormous diversity of variant antibodies displayed within a single library; the ability to tailor MAbs with the desired properties by using different strategies such as depletion, guided selection, and biochemical control; and the possibility to be applied against practically any kind of target antigen [33].

            "text": "In this study, we have established SpyDisplay as a new phage display method with some critical differences to traditional phage display. A key distinction between SpyDisplay and traditional antibody phage display is the separate folding of antibody and coat protein, which may be beneficial for the display of correctly folded antibodies. We have not found a simple way to prove this experimentally, as essentially all antibodies we work with have already gone through a selection by phage display, and as our libraries are already optimized for expression in E. coli. With our assumption, which is derived from first principles, we hope to encourage researchers who have struggled with phage display of difficult proteins to evaluate the suitability of SpyDisplay for their proteins of interest. In practical terms, the use of the library phagemid as expression plasmid saves time by eliminating a molecular cloning step before or after screening, which is laborious, especially if many pannings are performed in parallel. Alternative methods for avoiding subcloning, such as using an amber stop codon between Fab and pIII, have been shown to deliver sufficient free Fab for screening and small-scale expressions. However, due to low expression yields, production of larger amounts of Fab still necessitates the use of a dedicated expression vector. 28 Having a phagemid without pIII has a further advantage during library construction because, as transformation efficiency inversely correlates with plasmid size, larger libraries can be generated by using the smaller SpyDisplay phagemid which lacks the pIII gene (1230 bp). 29 dditionally, our optimized SpyDisplay protocol allows one panning round to be performed in a single day without the need for plating the output, which is especially important for high throughput antibody selections. Finally, SpyDisplay enables selection of antibodies with high affinity against folded proteins and antibody paratopes. The suitability of SpyDisplay for selection of antibodies against challenging targets like unstructured proteins will have to be shown in the future, while bearing in mind that the success of selections is also contingent upon the quality of the antibody library. \n\nMonovalent and polyvalent phage display are commonly implemented by switching the type of helper phage.",

In recent years several new applications for oligopeptide phage display in disease related fields have been developed which has led to the identification of various new antigens. These novel identified immunogenic proteins provide new insights into host pathogen interactions and can be used for the development of new diagnostic tests and vaccines. In this review we focus on the M13 oligopeptide phage display system for pathogen research but will also give examples for lambda phage display and for applications in other disease related fields. In addition, a detailed technical work flow for the identification of immunogenic oligopeptides using the pHORF system is given. The described identification of immunogenic proteins of pathogens using oligopeptide phage display can be linked to antibody phage display resulting in a vaccine pipeline.",

Compared with conventional antibodies, nanobodies have high stability, high affinity, the advantages of easy to produce, and can recognize inaccessible epitopes (Shu et al., 2019;Zhu et al., 2015). Moreover, phage-displayed nanobodies can provide an advantage over the soluble nanobodies being used as reporter elements for immunoassays development. For example, M13 phage particles contain approximately 2700 copies of pVIII capsid protein per phage. This can be used for signal amplification and modification (Goldman et al., 2009;Peltomaa, Lopez-Perolio, Benito-Pena, Barderas, & Moreno-Bondi, 2016). So, phage-displayed nanobodies could be valuable reagents for immunoassay development. \n\nIn this study, specific phage-displayed nanobodies against Cry2A were isolated from a naive nanobody library. Using these phage-displayed nanobodies as the detection antibody, a sensitive double antibody sandwich chemiluminescent immunoassay (DAS-CLIA) was established for the detection of Cry2A toxin. Method validation has been conducted with spiked cereal samples. The proposed phage-displayed nanobodies based DAS-CLIA can provide an alternative approach for the determination of Bt Cry toxins offering a number of advantages including an unlimited supply of uniform reagent.",

            "text": "Efforts have been made to increase the sensitivity of immunosensors on the basis of the sandwich assay [91][92][93] and the subtractive inhibition assay (SIA) [94,95]. \n\nTo develop new biomolecular recognition elements with higher stabilities and higher affinities for target bacteria, researchers have recently integrated phage display with molecular imprinting in SPR biosensors [96]. Bacteriophages are a useful alternative to antibodies in the detection of bacteria. For example, S. aureus was detected with an SPR sensor by using a lytic phage as the recognition element, and the detection limit was 10 4 CFU/mL [97]. \n\nPhage display technology is another tool for developing single-chain antibodies to bacteria. Phage-like antibodies have advantages such as in vitro production, a low cost, a low molecular weight, and high stability [98]. Phage display antibodies have been used to detect Listeria monocytogenes in an SPR biosensor (detection limit, 2 \u00d7 10 6 CFU/mL), which indicates the promise of non-antibody recognition elements [98]. \n\nIn the past few decades, SPR-based sensors have been used for the simultaneous detection of multiple analytes, but they are limited by the number of analytes. The use of multianalyte sensors will depend on the needs of specific applications. Primary applica- A known number of biorecognition elements are incubated and allowed to bind to the analyte in the sample. Then, the mixture is washed off the sensor surface, and unreacted biorecognition elements are fixed. In this case, the sensor response is inversely proportional to the analyte concentration. This approach increases the sensitivity of the assay but also increases the cost and time of analysis owing to the use of secondary antibodies and multistep manipulations. \n\nSPR-based immunosensors have great potential for the rapid detection of microorganisms in food and water samples. However, the detection limits achieved with these sensors cannot compete with those offered by traditional methods.",

            "text": "However, PCR-based assays require expensive equipment, trained personnel, and a consistent power supply, making them unsuitable for on-site testing. Recently, several investigators have developed alternative methods, including MALDI-TOF MS [17,18], luminescent phage [19], gold nanoparticle (GNP) [20], and lateral-flow strip immunoassay (LFSA) [21] for K. pneumoniae detection. However, these methods also have drawbacks such as the need for sophisticated equipment (MALDI-TOF MS), the need for a relatively long incubation time (luminescent phage), and low sensitivity (GNP and LFSA). \n\nBiosensors are a sophisticated alternative to commonly used molecular bacterial detection methods, providing cost-effective, specific, sensitive, and in situ real-time monitoring with minimal sample preparation and detection time [22]. Biosensors are essentially made up of a recognition element coupled to a transducer that converts specific analyte binding to receptors into a detectable or measurable readout [23,24]. Therefore, developing biosensors with high sensitivity and specificity requires the design and use of recognition elements that specifically bind to the pathogen of interest. Although antibodies are the most commonly used recognition element in affinity biosensor research, their production and purification costs, as well as their stability during and after immobilization on sensor surfaces, are difficult to manage [24]. Short peptides derived from phage-displayed libraries have recently been introduced as an intriguing alternative for developing novel biosensing platforms. As opposed to antibodies, peptides are more stable and easier to manipulate at the molecular level, and they have a low manufacturing cost [25,26]. In fact, phage-displayed peptides have been successfully employed as molecular recognition elements for the detection of bacterial toxins [27] as well as the identification of Staphylococcus aureus [28,29], Pseudomonas aeruginosa [30], Salmonella typhimurium [31,32], and Bacillus anthracis [33].",

            "text": "In these cases, it is recommended to use alternative methods like non-antibody binding proteins (or protein scaffolds) and in vitro antibody display technologies (Alfaleh et al., 2020;Gebauer and Skerra, 2020). In contrast to monoclonal antibodies, protein scaffolds are single polypeptide chain structures without disulfide bridges or post-translational modifications that show high solubility and stability and can allow the selection for affinity, stability, and enzymatic activity (Simeon and Chen, 2018;Gebauer and Skerra, 2020). Additionally, in vitro antibody display technologies have many advantages, including the ability to be genetically modified to increase selectivity, specificity, and sensitivity, ease of production in E. coli, and reproducibility (Frenzel et al., 2017;Chiu et al., 2019;Raeisi et al., 2022a). Hence, various studies have suggested the use of phage display-derived antibodies for diagnostic purposes (Chamorro and Merko\u00e7i, 2016;Mohd Ali et al., 2021). Innovative developments based on antibodies (e.g. various biosensor platforms) can provide rapid, reliable, and sensitive detection capability, which help the accurate diagnosis of specific targets. Importantly, due to the increase in public health concerns about nosocomial CDI, designing immunosensors can be proposed for rapid detection and disease management (Zhu et al., 2014b). Additionally, the combination of nanotechnology and various biosensor platforms has attracted a lot of attention as an excellent approach for developing fast, highly, sensitive and specific devices for the diagnosis of bacterial and viral infections (Prasad, 2014;Park et al., 2016), which can improve the quality and precision of disease diagnosis (Castillo et al., 2020;Younis et al., 2020). Application of rAb fragments (scFv, sdAb, etc.) to develop immunosensors or immunoassays has several distinct advantages, the most important of them is that rAb fragments can be readily produced in vitro. In addition, rAbs are easily formatted through genetic engineering or chemical conjugation for coupling antibodies to the sensors used to detect antigens.",

            "text": "Since Richard Bruynoghe and Joseph Maisin first reported in 1921 that the injection of phages into and around surgically opened lesions effectively treated staphylococcal skin disease, the mainstream clinical application of phages has focused on their conversion into \"antibiotics\" that can treat common resistant diseases.Treatment with medicinal bacteria has also achieved positive clinical expectations [217].For the MDR bacteria that are common in clinical practice, the current phage preparations mainly focus on Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P.aeruginosa), Acinetobacter baumannii (A.baumannii), Klebsiella pneumoniae (K.pneumoniae), and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) [218].So far, no adverse immune reactions caused by the application of large doses of phages in vivo have been found [219].Recent studies have shown that the use of phages for decolonisation is usually safe, considering the threat posed to humans by refractory bacteria and the importance of colonization in subsequent infections and pathogen transmission, the use of phages will be an effective alternative to bacterial decolonisation [220].\n\nIn addition, clinical applications related to phages include monoclonal antibodies derived from phage display.Today, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have become the dominant product category in the biopharmaceutical market [221].In the early 1990s, John McCafferty and Sir.Gregory Winter developed an in vitro antibody selection technology called antibody phage display, which enabled the discovery of antibody-based drugs for a variety of purposes.Since then, more than 70 phage-derived antibodies have entered clinical studies.Currently, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved 14 phage display-derived antibodies and antibody fragments.Monoclonal antibodies derived from these phage displays have made significant contributions to the diagnosis and treatment of diseases [222].Unfortunately, as mentioned in the previous section, despite the promising applications of phages as delivery vehicles, so far there are no reports of human preclinical/clinical studies on phages as delivery vehicles.Although phages as nanomedicines have been widely used in animal experiments, there is a large gap between treatments in humans and animal experiments.",

            "text": "In addition to their use in ELISAs, phage-displayed scFv have been used for the imaging of Bacillus subtilis spores [32]. In that work, phage were dye labeled and as seen for ELISAs, the multiple copies of pVIII per phage offered an advantage over dye-labeled conventional antibodies in their visualization of single spores. We have also found that the C8 displayed phage were dramatically superior for the visualization of dot blot assays for ricin. Figure 6 (left side) shows intense binding of C8-phage to both ricin and ricin A chain, but virtually no binding to ricin B chain or BSA. Corresponding experiments using soluble C8 generated much weaker signal to any of the immobilized targets (Figure 6, right side). \n\nPhage display is often used for the selection of short peptides specific for target antigens. In these experiments, using the phage-display reagent gives the added advantage that often multiple copies of each peptide are displayed per phage. Previously, we studied the use of peptides displayed on phage as reagents for the detection of staphylococcal enterotoxin B [33]. Sandwich assays were performed with dye-labeled phage; however the selected peptides did not offer as sensitive detection as conventional antibodies. In our current work, we also tested C8-sdAb and C8-phage labeled with the fluorophore DyLight 549, however neither produced signals comparable to the same material biotinylated and thus were not pursued further. Others have used labeled phage-displayed peptides for imaging of tumor cells [34], which may lead to a valuable reagent for tumor imaging in vivo. Figure 6. Dot blot assay for ricin, ricin A chain, and ricin B chain using C8-phage (left) and C8-sdAb (right). C8-phage binding was visualized using HRP labeled anti M13 IgG while the C8-sdAb was visualized using HRP labeled anti-His. Color formation was generated using sigmafast Diaminobenzidine (DAB).",

In most cases the key element is the quality of the antibody used and recombinant antibodies have many advantages, including the ability to be genetically modified to improve selectivity, sensitivity and immobilisation. In practice, the development of these assays is simplified through the development of a suitable antibody and, subsequently, an assay format. While there are several problems associated with these methods, the potential for monitoring bacterial, fungal, viral and parasitic pathogens is immense.\n\nInnovative recent developments, such as the hand-held device described recently by Mujika et al. [85], signal the way forward for pathogen detection. Future trends will continue to implement immunosensor-based technologies into microdevices, ultimately permitting on-site analysis to be performed in a rapid, reliable and sensitive manner.",

            "text": "Epitopes are crucial components in the development of effective vaccines against infectious pathogens. These regions on the antigen's surface engage with antibodies, B-cell and T-cell receptors, and serve as the portions of a pathogen that the immune system identifies and attacks. By identifying and selecting the most potent epitopes, it becomes feasible to design vaccines that trigger a strong immune response against the pathogen, while minimizing harm to the host [1,2]. \n\nPhage display technology shows great promise as an approach for identifying and selecting epitopes. This technique enables the screening of extensive libraries of peptides or proteins against a specific target, such as a pathogen, facilitating the identification of highly specific epitopes. The successful utilization of phage display has been observed in the identification and selection of epitopes across a wide range of pathogens, encompassing viruses, bacteria, and parasites. Once these epitopes have been identified, they can be harnessed for the development of vaccines that precisely target the pathogen in question [3]. Notably, phage display has proven effective in identifying epitopes from the spike protein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [4], which have been used for the development of COVID-19 vaccines and diagnostic tests [5]. Furthermore, phage display has been utilized to identify epitopes derived from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. \n\nThese epitopes not only hold value in the realm of Tuberculosis (TB) serodiagnosis but also play a crucial role in the development of a potential TB vaccine [6]. \n\nThe objective of this study is to provide a comprehensive overview of epitope identification, covering various aspects such as the different techniques employed, their respective advantages and disadvantages, and the utilization of phages in the process. Additionally, it will delve into the procedure of epitope or mimotope selection using phage display, examining both the general applications for selecting pathogenic epitopes and specific applications within the realm of infectious diseases. Lastly, the study will explore the role of phages in the development of vaccines.",

            "text": "Background Current diagnostic methods for tuberculosis (TB), a major global health challenge that kills nearly two million people annually, are time-consuming and inadequate. During infection a number of bacterial molecules that play a role in the infective process are released and have been proposed as biomarkers for early TB diagnosis. Antigen 85 (Ag85) is the most abundant secreted TB protein, and a potential target for this diagnostic approach. One of the bottlenecks in the direct detection of such bacterial targets is the availability of robust, sensitive, specific antibodies. Methods Using Ag85 as a model, we describe a method to select antibodies against any potential target using a novel combination of phage and yeast display that exploits the advantage of each approach. Results The efficiency of this approach was attested to by the 111 specific antibodies identified in initial screens. These were assessed for binding to the different Ag85 subunits, affinity, and activity in sandwich assays. Conclusions The novelty of this approach lies in the possibility of screening the entire output of a phage antibody selection in a single experiment by yeast display. This can be considered analogous to carrying out a million ELISAs. The monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) identified in this way show high binding affinity and selectivity for the antigens and offer an advantage over traditional mAbs produced by relatively expensive and time consuming techniques. This approach has wide applicability, and the affinity of selected antibodies can be significantly improved, if required.",

            "text": "The use of MAbs against an infection pathogen is an area of great interest for research. In Table 2 it is demonstrated MAbs developed for infection disease who have been approved by the FDA. As can be seen, few MAbs are approved for use in infectious diseases, although there is still a strong demand for development in this field. Some challenges involving MAb production against pathogens are their economic viability due to their high cost and if target an episodic disease, there is no supporting for continued production. Moreover, there is a concern about the selection of neutralization-escape mutants [58]. However, they may be notably effective for certain emerging infectious diseases, in which the process of vaccine development could be lengthened and difficult. Thus, MAbs should have more effectiveness for the first response against these diseases [57]. \n\nSmall molecules are most antibiotic antivirals. However, Phage Display-derived MAbs have an overall success rate of 35% of passage from clinical phase I to launch, compared to an average of 12% for a small-molecule drug candidate [59]. In this regard, Phage Display-derived MAb is considered an important alternative approach to infectious disease treatment compared to classical small-molecule discovery. Raxibacumab is an example of a fast-track designation from the FDA, providing the expedition of the drug to use against B. anthracis infection. This bacterium secretes proteins, the lethal factor and the edema factor, that inhibit normal immune system functioning that ultimately cause cell death. The entry of these factors is mediated by the protective antigen (PA), also secreted by the bacteria. Raxibacumab is directed to B. anthracis PA and thus prevents the cellular Phage Display as a Strategy to Obtain Anti-flavivirus Monoclonal Antibodies DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.93076 uptake of the lethal factor and edema factor.

            "text": "Phage display has been introduced as an efficient alternative to hybridoma technology for the generation of therapeutically relevant antibodies. Antibody phage display (APD) provides the opportunity to design and construct large libraries of antibody fragments. The expression of antibodies on the surface of phage particles represents a powerful platform for the isolation of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with desired binding characteristics that can serve for the diagnosis and immunotherapy of various disorders especially infectious diseases [35]. \n\nAccording to the source of antibody-encoding sequences, phage antibody libraries (PALs) are divided into two main types of natural and synthetic libraries. Natural PALs consist of rearranged V gene repertoires of immune or non-immune (na\u00efve) donors. This type of antibody library has been constructed from different species including human, non-human primates, mouse, chicken, sheep, camel, and cattle. Immune libraries are considered as the most useful type of PALs for infectious diseases. They are constructed from immunized donors and typically exploited to obtain antibodies against a particular target antigen, e.g. an infectious viral or bacterial agent. A great advantage of immune PALs is that V genes harbor hypermutations and are affinity matured, though the toxicity of some antigens and ethical issues make it impossible to immunize human subjects with toxic, immunosuppressive, and life-threatening antigens. If immunization is not possible or is ethically impracticable, the construction of non-immune or na\u00efve PALs is an alternative. These libraries are generated from rearranged V gene repertoires of B cells derived from healthy and non-immunized donors. Accordingly, ethical issues with regard to the active immunization of humans and animals are avoided. Also, specific antibodies against non-immunogenic and toxic antigens can also be obtained. However, the isolated antibodies generally show low affinity. This emphasizes the need to improve binding affinity of the selected antibodies by using affinity maturation in vitro [36,37]. Unlike natural PALs that represent the naturally occurring diversity in the antibody repertoire, synthetic PALs harbor artificial diversity in V gene segments. In these PALs, V genes are reconstructed in vitro partially (semi-synthetic PALs) or completely (fully synthetic PALs).",

            "text": "ABSTRACT Cholera rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are vulnerable to virulent bacteriophage predation. We hypothesized that an enhanced cholera RDT that detects the common virulent bacteriophage ICP1 might serve as a proxy for pathogen detection. We previously developed a monoclonal antibody (mAb) to the ICP1 major capsid protein. Our objective was to design and assemble a first-of-its-kind RDT that detects both a bacterial pathogen (Vibrio cholerae) and associated virulent bacteriophage (ICP1). Candidate mAbs were expanded to increase design options and evaluated by immunological assays (ELISA; western blot). A subset of mAbs were selected for gold conjugation and printing on the RDT. The detection limit of the prototype RDTs was determined in diarrheal stools with the addition of ICP1. Three mAb candidates were developed and evaluated for the capsid decoration protein (ORF123) and tail fiber protein (ORF93), and the prior mAb for the major capsid protein (ORF122). A single mAb sandwich RDT prototype for ORF122 was able to detect ICP1; RDTs with mAbs to ORF123 and ORF93 failed to detect ICP1 in single- or dual-sandwich configurations. Biologically relevant concentrations for ICP1 were detected only after boiling the stool with ICP1; analysis by electron microscopy (EM) suggested increased epitope availability after boiling. In this study, we demonstrate a proof of concept for a functional RDT that can detect both the primary pathogen and a common virulent bacteriophage as a proxy for pathogen detection. Further optimization is required before scaled production and implementation. IMPORTANCE This paper represents an important step forward to address the vulnerability of cholera RDTs to the effects of phage predation on the target Vibrio cholerae. The assembly and evaluation of an RDT that detects both the primary pathogen and a phage as a proxy for the primary pathogen is an innovative solution. When optimized and evaluated in clinical studies, this tool may become critical in the cholera response tool kit as well as represent a diagnostic proof-of-concept for other",

            "text": "detection. Gene and colleagues (Gene et al., 2015) used naive and immune camelid antibody libraries for the selection via phage display of diagnostic nanobodies against internalin B (InIB), a protein which is strongly involved in host-cell invasion. Two of the five generated nanobodies, R3-03 and R3-30, showed picomolar binding affinities to InIB, representing a valuable resource for bacteria immunodetection in poorly concentrated samples. A recent study from Moreira et al. (2020) described the use in combination of different phage display techniques to identify new Listeria spp. protein biomarkers and rise antibodies against them. Initially, the human na\u00efve antibody display phage library HAL9/10 was used to generate antibodies against different cell fractions from L. monocytogenes (cell wall, membrane, and cytoplasm). This way, four binders were isolated, which allowed the identification of a novel target for Listeria spp. detection named pyruvate dehydrogenase complex-enzyme 2 (PDC-E2) by using both immunomagnetic separation/mass spectrometry (IMS-MS) and ORFeome phage display. One of these antibodies was also used in immunofluorescence on non-permeabilized cells confirming the surface localization of the target. Antibody selection against PDC-E2 recombinant antigen yielded 16 additional antibodies. These 20 antibodies were finally tested in indirect ELISA against a panel of 17 Listeria species (including the most virulent L. monocytogenes serotypes 4b, 1/2a, and 1/2b) and 16 non-Listeria species. Two antibodies, GSM313-E9 and GSM313-H8, provided 100% sensitivity and specificity for Listeria spp. detection. Moreover, the binding region (epitope) of 18 out of the 20 antibodies was identified via single-gene phage display for epitope mapping, enabling to define the lipoyl domains of PDC-E2 as the major contributors for the detection through this target.",

The scFv selected in this study was structurally characterized and applied in the immune complexes detection using human serum samples positive for strongyloidiasis. This diagnostic strategy is an important tool because it is indicative of active infection [12][13][14][15] . \n\nIn this study, we have selected an scFv clone through Phage Display against total proteins of S. venezuelensis as a model for S. stercoralis infection in humans, with a successful application in the serodiagnosis of human strongyloidiasis. Our novel scFv showed strong reactivity to a parasite protein fraction of ~65 kDa from S. venezuelensis, which further identified and characterized to be the heat shock protein 60 (HSP60) from Strongyloides sp., a 64 kDa protein shown in experimental models to have relevance to the parasite-host relationship, with potential significance for the host immune response 16 . This newly scFv was localized by immunofluorescence staining in the entire parasite body periphery and to regions of the digestive system from the infective larvae. Moreover, the scFv did not bind to T. solium metacestode, indicating specificity. \n\nThe scFv functionality was confirmed by a sandwich ELISA using this antibody fragment to detect immune complexes in serum samples from individuals with strongyloidiasis. The TG-ROC curve provided the optimum cut-off value, and ROC curve confirmed its high sensitivity and specificity, both values higher than 97%. The test performance indicated by the high LR+ (81.9) and the AUC value close to the maximum (1.00) conferred a high diagnostic value.",

However, scientific interest for bacteriophages arose again in the late 1980s, with the design of a novel technique: phage display. Since then, this application has proved to be extremely successful for the identification of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against a wide range of pathogens, and several companies currently use this technique for the discovery of their lead compounds.\n\nA recent report from 2014, commissioned by the UK government, predicts the killing of 10 million people across the world by 2050 because of antimicrobial-resistant infections; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) categorized some bacteria as presenting urgent, serious, and concerning threats [18]. Therefore, the appearance of multidrugresistant pathogens has renewed the importance of pioneering antibacterial strategies in order to prevent epidemic infections, with a close monitoring of hospitals as well as food industries. This is giving a boost in revisiting the practical applications of bacteriophages both for phage therapy and for rapid and precise detection of bacterial pathogens.",

            "text": "The search for innovative anti-cancer drugs remains a challenge. Over the past three decades, antibodies have emerged as an essential asset in successful cancer therapy. The major obstacle in developing anti-cancer antibodies is the need for non-immunogenic antibodies against human antigens. This unique requirement highlights a disadvantage to using traditional hybridoma technology and thus demands alternative approaches, such as humanizing murine monoclonal antibodies. To overcome these hurdles, human monoclonal antibodies can be obtained directly from Phage Display libraries, a groundbreaking tool for antibody selection. These libraries consist of genetically engineered viruses, or phages, which can exhibit antibody fragments, such as scFv or Fab on their capsid. This innovation allows the in vitro selection of novel molecules directed towards cancer antigens. As foreseen when Phage Display was first described, nowadays, several Phage Display-derived antibodies have entered clinical settings or are undergoing clinical evaluation. This comprehensive review unveils the remarkable progress in this field and the possibilities of using clever strategies for phage selection and tailoring the refinement of antibodies aimed at increasingly specific targets. Moreover, the use of selected antibodies in cutting-edge formats is discussed, such as CAR (chimeric antigen receptor) in CAR T-cell therapy or ADC (antibody drug conjugate), amplifying the spectrum of potential therapeutic avenues.",

Other VHH segments produced via phage display and animal immunization include those that bind to Rotavirus gp6, H5 hemagglutinin to inhibit H5N1 influenza virus replication, and VHH that recognizes the tail of infectious phage in Lactococcus bacteria. \n\nExamples of the use of phage antibodies for virus detection using classical methods are presented in Table 2.

For example, Kim et al. [180] developed a COVID-19 biosensor based on the lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA). They used three rounds of biopanning to generate phage antibodies (from a na\u00efve chicken phage library) with a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) and crystallizable fragment (Fc) combination, which was specific for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. The scFv-Fc antibodies bound specifically and with high affinity to the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 but not to those other coronaviruses. The detection limit for this virus was 2 ng of antigenic protein. The biosensor could selectively detect SARS-CoV-2 virus within 20 min without detecting SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV virus. In addition, the assay was made more accurate with a portable LFIA reader. When the LFIA biosensor was mounted onto a portable reader, the obtained image was analyzed automatically with LED and CMOS sensors [180]. \n\nA sandwiched phage-based enzyme-linked chemiluminescence immunoassay was created by Liu et al.

Nevertheless, there are several reports on developing specific IBDV recombinant antibodies by applying chicken preimmunized library and/or bacterial libraries. Zhang et al [11] described the application of bacterial display for isolation of scFv antibody fragments against IBDV from an antibody library via the VP2 protein. Sapats et al [24] developed two chicken scFv antibody fragments reacting with high virulent strains of IBDV. They argued that their method was 8-16 to times more sensitive for IBDV antigen detection than the mouse monoclonal antibody ELISA. \n\nThese serological results revealed that scFv could be used as highly specific and sensitive ELISA reagents for the detection of avian pathogens. In fact, the power of recombinant antibodies over previously described conventional methods, for fine antigenic differentiation and to provide a sensitive, specific, and simple platform has been well confirmed [24]. In another study, phage display technology was used for the isolation of a specific scFv antibody from the immune spleen cells of chickens immunized with a high virulent strain of IBDV [12]. \n\nSapats et al [1] developed a number of scFv recombinant antibodies by biopanning of a phage-display libraries derived from the spleen of chickens immunized with an Australian strain of IBDV. These scFvs showed a significant potential for the discrimination of different IBDV strains and neutralizing capacity.",

Identification of bacterial colonies using membrane filters and donor plasma is useful for the initial screening of human Fab fragments to major antigenic molecules of pathogens. Preparation of immunoglobulin gene libraries from EB virus-transformed oligoclonal B-LCL can also be used for preparation of human Fab fragments to pathogens and self-antigens. Recently, a new technique bypassing the phage display platform has also been developed.

            "text": "Phages, which are viruses that infect bacteria, can serve as valuable tools in detecting and identifying specific bacterial strains. Phage-based techniques include phage typing, where different phage strains are used to differentiate and classify bacterial strains based on their susceptibility to specific phages. These innovative approaches have the potential to offer enhanced sensitivity, specificity, and cost-effectiveness compared with traditional methods. In summary, this review sheds light on the evolving field of phage-based detection, which holds promise for revolutionizing microbial infection diagnosis across diverse industries, ranging from healthcare to agriculture and beyond. Phage typing strategy exists for the variety of clinical pathogens such as Clostridium [22], Brucella [23], Enterococci [24], Salmonella [25,26], Shigella [27], toxigenic Escherichia coli [28], Listeria [29], Bacillus cereus [30], Campylobacter [31], Vibrio cholerae [32], Mycobacterium tuberculosis [33], Yersinia [34], Proteus [35] and Staphylococci [32] but it depends on maintenance of huge stocks of phages and strains. Indeed, while a wealth of information exists regarding various phage typing schemes, these approaches are not commonly utilized for the identification of bacterial pathogens in clinical settings. Despite the availability of numerous studies and reviews that have explored phage diagnosis for specific pathogens, your review serves as a groundbreaking contribution by summarizing the collective research conducted on phage-based diagnostics targeting a wide range of pathogens. By comprehensively covering phagebased diagnostic methods across different sectors and discussing their potential applications for a broad spectrum of bacterial infections, your review offers a unique and comprehensive perspective. This pioneering work highlights the value of phage-based diagnostics in addressing the challenges associated with identifying and managing bacterial pathogens, encompassing a diverse array of industries and environments. Through this review, we have provided an invaluable resource for researchers, clinicians and professionals across various fields, enabling them to understand the potential and implications of phage-based diagnostics in the context of microbial infections that pose significant global health concerns.",

            "text": "b); scFvs are composed of the V H and V L domain connected by a short flexible linker. Antibody Fab fragments displayed on the phage coat protein have comparably higher structural stability and can be readily converted to intact IgG antibodies, usually without impairing binding activity [100,101]. The elegance of phage-displayed libraries is apparent in the linkage between antibody phenotype (specificity and sensitivity) and genotype (genetic information) via the phage particle. Due to the small size and high solubility (10 13 particles/ml) of phage particles, repertoire sizes up to 10 11 independent clones can be efficiently produced and displayed in a single library [102][103][104].\n\nGene repertoires for phage display libraries can be obtained from na\u00efve or immunized animals, or the libraries may be synthetically constructed using randomized CDR c Biopanning with a phagedisplayed library. Initial pools of antibodies on the surface of phages are applied to antigens immobilized on a solid surface, e.g., ELISA plates or magnetic beads. Non-specific phages are removed by stringent washing. Antigen-bound phages are eluted and re-infected into E. coli to produce a subset of phages for the next cycle of panning. After several rounds, the antigen-binding clones are sufficiently enriched and individual clones can be selected for further analysis sequences within fixed frameworks. Phage display na\u00efve antibody libraries are constructed from rearranged V genes of IgM repertoires. Because the gene sequences are derived from B cells of human donors, the na\u00efve libraries are relatively close to the human antibody germ line and have a low risk of immunogenicity. The main advantage of an immunized library over a na\u00efve library is that antibody genes in the immunized library have undergone natural affinity maturation in vivo, allowing the development of high-affinity antibodies against the target. However, this approach requires that immunogenic response can be successfully induced by the antigen of interest, and new libraries must be prepared for each new target. Single large na\u00efve [94,104,105] and synthetic [102,106,107] libraries have yielded high affinity antibodies (sub-nanomolar range) against a wide spectrum of targets. Therefore,",

The preparation of mimicking peptides and anti-idiotype antibodies can be challenging, and the selection of mimotopes from phage display peptide libraries may encounter failure probabilities. Likewise, obtaining anti-idiotype antibodies from immune animals can also pose challenges. Overcoming these limitations requires expanding the diversity of peptide libraries and enhancing screening techniques for positive clones. Ongoing research to optimize conditions for mimotope selection and screening holds the potential to further improve their utility in cholera toxins detection. Despite the challenges, mimotopes present a promising avenue for the development of safe and effective immunoassays. While immunosensor mimotopes have shown promise in cholera toxins immunoassays, some reported mimotopes have demonstrated only marginal improvements in assay performance. The use of phage display peptides can lead to complex procedures, and laboratorysynthesized mimotopes may lose binding activity in certain cases. To address these issues, further investigation into the structure of mimotopes and their interaction with receptors is essential. Site mutagenesis could be introduced to enhance the characteristics of mimotopes and optimize immunoassay performance. \n\nThis review delves into a pioneering avenue in the realm of cholera toxin detection: phage display-based nano immunosensors. Engineered bacteriophages, uniquely tailored with specific antibody fragments or mimotopes, exhibit an exceptional affinity for cholera toxin. This dynamic interplay orchestrates the generation of quantifiable signals, enabling remarkably sensitive detection and precise quantification. In the current landscape of cholera screening and detection, animals and animal-derived products play a significant role. Monoclonal antibody (mAb) based rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are employed, although their sensitivity is hindered by the presence of the common virulent bacteriophage ICP1 (172). A study explores phage-displayed mimotopes for a cholera vaccine, overcoming challenges posed by the toxic nature of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (173).",

            "text": "The whole phage-based assays have been developed for bacteria detection involving the gene expression by reported phages inside the host cell and further detection of bioluminescence [15][16][17][18]. The fluorescent-labeled phages can also be employed for staining based detection of the target analytes upon attaching to the bacteria surface [19][20][21][22]. Detection of the released progeny phages after cell lysis could be used as an amplification method for quantitative analysis of the infected bacteria cells, serving as a promising detection technique in antibiotic susceptible testing as well [23]. This type of phage-based assays has been available as commercial kits, e.g., FASTPlaque-TB \u00ae and PhageTek MB \u00ae , for drug resistance detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis [24][25][26]. The overall accuracy of this phage amplification assay is promising but several concerns like the low sensitivity and specificity require more improvement before the widespread applicability of this technology. Studies have also been conducted concerning the phage-component based assays by taking advantage of the specific RBPs, lysins proteins and tail fibers for bacteria detection [27,28]. In addition, phages can be genetically engineered for the detection of other analytes with the phage display technique that was first reported by Smith in 1985 [29]. He demonstrated that foreign DNA fragments can be inserted into filamentous phage gene III to display a fusion peptide or protein on the phage particle, providing specific affinity for antibodies directed against the incorporated foreign sequence [29,30]. Phages expressing different peptides on the surface can be selected from a phage display library containing phage clones carrying different foreign DNA inserts, providing specific binding affinity to desired targets, including different types of antibodies and other organic analytes [30]. \n\nOver the last few decades, phage-based biosensors have been considered as a promising technology for biosensing of various analytes. It is well-known that a biosensor is a type of analytical device that can convert biological interactions into different kinds of measurable and processable signals [31].",

            "text": "The analysis of the literature data shows the good prospects of using phage-display methods for the design of analytical tools for the early detection of cancer, specifically prostate cancer. Traditionally, phage-display methods have been used for the discovery and improvement of antibodies, and their antigen-binding fragments are widely used in numerous immunochemical detection devices. Considering the huge public interest in this area of research and development [76], one can expect the further development of antibody phage display technology to improve the performance of modern detection methods. Furthermore, the tremendous success in the development of novel analytical methods for the fast, inexpensive detection of SARS viruses using novel analytical platforms and sensing materials during the COVID pandemic promoted the development of new approaches for the construction of novel biosensor platforms for the mass screening of humans for early signs of cancer. In this contest, the landscape phages described here appear competitive in comparison with novel interfaces and diagnostic probes [16]. For example, the model-phage-based electrochemical and ELISA immunosensors showed comparable limits of detection to most advanced antibody-, aptamer-, and Au-based biosensors. In contrast to other interfaces, the phage structure is extraordinarily robust, being resistant to heat, organic solvents, urea, acid, and alkali, and can tolerate different modifications that increase the efficacy of their use as detection and diagnostic probes [124]. For example, the conjugation of a phage with gold nanoparticles is a straightforward, reliable process [62], which can be easily adapted for the construction of different types of lateral flow immunoassays for point-of-care prostate-specific antigen testing [16]. Purified phages can be stored indefinitely at moderate temperatures without losing their infectivity and binding activity [46,125,126]. An important advantageous characteristic of landscape phages is their availability for safe, large-scale production, and their use in prostate cancer control, as recently reviewed [16,[127][128][129]. \n\nFunding: The effort of the Author in writing the Review was supported by Auburn University.",

            "text": "The number of phage display-derived candidates currently in clinical development demonstrates the value of phage display as an established and reliable drug discovery platform. As shown in Table 1, over 40 biological drugs or drug candidates were discovered using phage display. Five are approved drugs (4 antibodies and 1 peptide), and an additional 3 antibody-based candidates (trebananib, ramucirumab and necitumumab) are in Phase 3 development for the treatment of various cancers. Of these, completion of Phase 3 studies (either primary or estimated study completion) of both ramucirumab (NCT01170663, NCT00917384, NCT00703326) and necitumumab (NCT00981058, NCT00982111) are estimated for 2013. \n\nMost of the phage display candidates in Table 1 are antibodies or antibody derivatives, with ecallantide (Kalbitor\u00ae), Xyntha purification peptide, and the peptibody trebananib (AMG-386) being the exceptions. While peptide-based therapeutics are clinically promising due to their small size and established manufacturing processes, their short half-life initially limited their potential as therapeutic strategies. Advances in protein engineering such as peptide cyclization, use of fusion proteins (e.g., the Fc fragment), unnatural amino acids and conjugation to polyethylene glycol and polysialic acids have mitigated some of these limitations. 83 As a consequence, there has been a recent re-emergence of peptidebased therapeutics development. 8 With the power and versatility of phage display, it is likely that phage display will continue to provide candidate peptides for therapeutic or diagnostic applications. 84,85 necdotal evidence has been used to support the hypothesis that a higher percentage of mAbs selected from synthetic or semisynthetic phage libraries have lower solubility profiles compared with murine hybridoma antibodies. 86 However, this phenomenon, if true, is easily overcome by employing a variety of techniques. Screening library outputs using a combination of cross interaction chromatography and dynamic light scattering have proven effective as early solubility screening techniques. 87",

These aptasensors have compelling advantages over the traditional antibody-based assays, such as low cost, high throughput, ease of use, stability, and minimum batch-to-batch variability. These advantages are likely to contribute to the wide acceptability of aptasensors for diagnostics development in the future. Although the published literature on the topic is much larger, to conform to space limitations, we list in Table 3 a selection of recently reported aptasensors targeting pathogens. \n\nThe detection limits for whole-cell pathogens with aptasensors have reached extremely low levels, down to the single-cell level. However, the great majority of this research is not translating clinically or even reaching the patent stage. Efforts toward improving manufacturing strategies and the discovery of translational technologies are necessary to further harvest these significant successes. The relatively high stability of aptamers versus antibodies offers such an opportunity for integrating aptasensors into mass production and bringing whole-cell pathogen detection from the laboratory to the market.",

This interaction causes the TL to become visible to the naked eye, and it appears red when gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are used. To date, antibodies (Abs) remain the gold standard bioreceptors in LFAs. For instance, Cox et al. reported an antibody-based LFA for rapid point-ofneed B. anthracis detection with a limit of detection (LOD) of about 2.5 \u00d7 10 4 CFU/mL. 7 espite the ubiquitous applicability of antibodies as bioreceptors in LFAs, they present some limitations due to their production process, which still primarily depends on animal host infection and bleeding. They can suffer from variability (batch-to-batch), low specificity and stability, and relatively high prices due to the dependency and high pressure on the suppliers, especially highlighted during COVID-19 pandemics. 8 Antibody generation using animal immunization raises scientific and ethical concerns. 9 Also, generating, selecting, and mass-producing antibodies requires 16\u221224 months, which is much longer than the critical initial period when an outbreak is emerging. Therefore, there is an urgent need to find alternatives to antibodies when it comes to the development of new in vitro diagnostic tests. \n\nBacteriophages, or phages, are viruses that exclusively replicate within bacteria and are equipped with highly specific mechanisms to recognize, adsorb, infect, and eliminate their bacterial hosts during their life cycle. \u221213 While whole phages have been used as bioreceptors in biosensor applications, 14 their efficiency is hampered by their frequent incorrect orientation when immobilized on sensor surfaces, still posing a significant technical barrier to their widespread use in biosensor applications. 15 Phages employ different proteins, enabling them to specifically bind components of the bacterial cell envelope.

            "text": "generally used to measure and identify the contents of antigens in multivalent vaccines. To date, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against V. cholerae O1 have been obtained by immunization of mice with the LPS or strain(s) of Ogawa and Inaba serotypes using hybridoma technology [8,[10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21]. Most of the mAbs reacted with both Inaba and Ogawa serotypes, due to the minor structural differences in these serotypes, and few of them were Ogawa-or Inaba-serotype specific [8,14]. \n\nThe advent of phage display technology has enabled facile isolation of mAbs from combinatorial antibody libraries [22,23]. The major advantages of phage display include the virtual independence of the selection process from target characteristics, which allows application to a wide range of antigens, irrespective of their immunogenicity or toxicity, and the full control over the selection conditions [24]. The isolation of mAbs by phage display employs a na\u00efve antibody library generated from donor-derived B cells, immune library, a synthetic library from synthetically derived diversity, or a semi-synthetic library in single-chain Fv (scFv) or Fab format [25][26][27][28][29][30][31]. ScFv fragments often have a high tendency to form multimers as well as aggregates and have been found to lose affinity during conversion to Ig (immunoglobulin)G, whereas Fab fragments have been found to possess comparably higher structural stability by the presence of the CH1 and light-chain constant domain (CL), and thus their binding activities were retained after conversion to IgG [32].",

            "text": "For diagnostic applications, whole phages and phage-derived proteins have been extensively explored [27]. According to Meile et al. (2020), phage-based pathogen recognition tools can be divided into two categories by their modes of action: infection-based and capture-based detection methods (Figure 2). In the present review, we focus on capturebased detection methods in which tail proteins are used as bio-sensing molecules to detect a particular bacterial strain. In the following, we describe the relevant methodologies that may be implemented for bacterial detection. \n\nWhole phage particles can be applied as bio-recognition elements through their specific binding to the host. This approach has been extensively explored in the development of biosensors. A biosensor can be defined as a detection device in which biomolecular interactions between a bioprobe and an analyte are translated into a measurable signal by means of transduction systems [28]. A typical biosensor consists of a surface functionalized with a biorecognition element, a transduction system that generates a signal reflecting the number of binding events, and an amplifier that processes the signal to give a readable output [29]. The bioprobe is arguably the most crucial element: it confers specificity and sensitivity, which are essential features of a reliable diagnostic tool. Various types of molecules have been used for this purpose, including nucleic acids [30], antibodies or antibody fragments [31,32], and both wild-type and engineered phages (reporter phages) [33]. Another group of potential bioprobes comprises phage-derived binders, such as RBP (described in more detail below) [34,35], endolysin cell wall-binding domains (CBD) [36][37][38], and phage-display peptides [39,40]. Details may be found in existing comprehensive reviews of biosensor transduction systems and their modes of action, e.g., [41]. In addition to surface-immobilized phages in biosensors, whole phage particles, conjugated with, e.g., magnetic nanobeads can also be used as capture probes in bacterial detection assays.",

            "text": "a biomolecular recognition event, antibody-based detection methodologies are considered the standard assays in clinical analysis (Aizawa 1994;Stefan et al. 2000). These assays are well established and have been demonstrated to reach the required sensitivity and selectivity. However, the use of antibodies in situ detection methods and in the analysis of very complex samples could encounter some limitations mainly deriving from the nature and synthesis of these protein receptors. Antibodies are relatively cheap, but their production relies on the immune response of an animal. Besides the ethical problems related to the use of animals, it is also difficult to generate antibodies for toxic compounds or small compounds that cannot elicit an immune response. In order to avoid some of these drawbacks, recent advances in biotechnology, nanotechnology and surface chemistry offer the possibility of developing other novel, affinity-based recognition molecules that have been explored as alternatives to the traditionally used antibodies. This is a domain in which phages and aptamers can play a successful role. They have emerged as viable options thanks to their high selectivity and affinity towards their targets, comparable to that of antibodies. The high affinity and hence high sensitivity, high specificity, robustness, animal-friendly production and ease of modification are some of the defining properties that make the use of aptamers and phages advantageous in diagnostic and biosensing tools (Van Dorst et al. 2010b).",

            "text": "In this study, we aimed to isolate serotype-specific DENV NS1 antibodies which could be used to improve the utility of DENV NS1 diagnostic assays. The use of phage display and a specific antibodies were immobilised and used to capture native NS1 from supernatants of Vero cells infected with DENV serotypes, Zika virus, or non-infected. Captured NS1 was detected using the serotype-specific reformatted mAbs or a flavivirus specific mAb. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0180669.g002 subtractive biopanning strategy directed the selection of binders towards serotype-specific epitopes, which is not feasible using immunisation strategies followed by conventional hybridoma technology. A previous report using phage display to isolate serotype-specific binders against NS1 did not incorporate a serotype-selective strategy, and isolation of serotype-specific binders was serendipitous and not successful for all four serotypes [28]. Serotype-specific antibodies have previously been isolated using immunisation and hybridoma technology, and these were used in a serotyping DENV NS1 ELISA [29][30][31]. Again, the approach was not a serotype-selective strategy so selection of serotype-specific mAbs required thorough screening amongst a majority of cross-reactive clones. An additional drawback with their assay was that the sandwich ELISA required a unique pair of serotype-specific antibodies for each DENV serotype which complicates the assay procedure. \n\nWe demonstrated that our phage library-derived serotype-specific antibodies can be paired with a single pan-reactive capture antibody. This compatibility enables a multiplexed diagnostic approach, and we showed that detection and serotyping can be performed in a single well, with the four detection antibodies conjugated to different fluorescent markers. Some serotype cross-reactivity with DENV-3 NS1 was observed when detecting DENV-4 NS1, indicating that the assay requires further optimisation. The observed cross-reactivity is likely due to sub-optimal optical settings on the fluorescence detector, rather than cross-reactivity of the mAbs.",

            "text": "Our data demonstrated that monoclonal phage-displayed scFv ligands specific for human plasma proteins could be quickly screened from a phage display library using the library against proteome strategy. The selected plasma protein-specific phages could be directly used as affinity matrices by crosslinking for the isolation of corresponding proteins from the complex. This approach represents an efficient way to prepare affinity ligands for multiple antigens in a proteome, even without any actual purification of antigens.\n\nCompared with the conventional procedures for ligand preparation such as monoclonal or polyclonal antibody and chemical synthesis/screening, phage library display is much more powerful. Therefore, many efforts are aimed at applying phage   Phage applied (pfu) 1.6 \u03eb 10 13 1.5 \u03eb 10 12 6.9 \u03eb 10 13 Phage eluted (pfu) 7.8 \u03eb 10 8 1.4 \u03eb 10 9 7.3 \u03eb 10 10 Recovery (eluted/applied) 4.9 \u03eb 10 \u03ea5 9.3 \u03eb 10 \u03ea4 1.0 \u03eb 10 \u03ea3 library for ligand identification (23,24). However, strategies of panning on a complex antigen system were always under studies in contrast to ligand screening against one individual antigen. As reported here, we applied a phage-displayed scFv library for panning on a whole proteome. Our results showed the validity of the library against proteome strategy and the potential in high-throughput ligand screening. In this study, panning was carried out in solution to maintain the natural conformations of plasma proteins to the greatest extent. As a result, the clones bound to proteins with artificial conformations when antigens were immobilized on a solid matrix were avoided (16). Although phage library-derived ligands were extensively studied (23,25,26), employing phage particles directly as affinity ligands was a relatively new concept. In the present work, phage-displayed scFv fragments were cross-linked to serve as affinity matrices for a favorable alternative, compared with phage-displayed peptides or wild-type phages as reported before (14,19,27). The matrices were strong enough to become support materials as well as appropriate ligands for affinity purification. Cross-linked phage matrix has great advantages over phage ligands im",

On the other hand, lateral flow assays incorporate the epitopes conjugated to labels (e.g., gold nanoparticles) that enable visual detection of the target pathogen specific IgG and IgM antibodies in patient samples. \n\nMoreover, the utilization of phage display technology allows for the identification of epitopes that are conserved among different strains of a pathogen. This aspect is particularly valuable for developing diagnostic tests capable of detecting a wide range of pathogen variants [56]. By incorporating epitopes of a pathogen into diagnostic assays, the accuracy and efficiency of pathogen detection and identification are significantly enhanced. \n\nThese diagnostic assays provide crucial information to healthcare professionals, empowering them to make timely decisions regarding patient management and treatment strategies.

            "text": "So far, two antibody formats, Fabs and scFvs, have dominated antibody phage display and the production of solu-ble antibody fragments in E. coli. In this study, to test whether it is possible to combine the advantages of both formats, various single chain Fab (scFab) constructs were generated and evaluated. In scFab, the light chain and the Fd fragment of a Fab fragment are connected by a polypeptide linker derived from the pIII of filamentous phage M13. Three scFab variants with different linker length from 32 to 36 amino acids and one 34 amino acid variant with a deleted intermolecular disulphide bond (scFab\u0394C) were compared to scFv and Fab using the lysozyme binding antibody D1.3 [23,24] as a model antibody. In mammalian cells, an antibody construct using a 30 aa Gly-Ser linker to combine the HC fragment and the LC has succesfully been produced to generate a single chain IgG [28]. The scFab designs presented in this study, in contrast, were evaluated both for their compatibility with antibody phage display and production of soluble antibody fragments in microbial production systems. For the latter, in the prokaryotic expression system E. coli, both the phage display phagemid pHAL1 [9] and the E. coli expression vector pOPE101 [29] were tested. Additionally, the production in the eukaryotic expression system using the yeast P. pastoris was demonstrated.\n\nThe applicability of the new antibody designs for antibody phage display is of major importance, as antibody phage display is currently a major technology for the generation of human antibodies for research, diagnostic and therapy (for reviews see [11,22,30]. Display of the different antibody formats on phage was evaluated using the Antigen binding phage ELISA of phage presenting D1.3 antibody fragment variants two most frequently used helperphage, the standard M13K07 and the pIII deficient Hyperphage [26,27,31], which enforces polyvalent display on filamentous phage.

            "text": "Immunoassays based on sandwich immuno-complexes of capture and detection antibodies simultaneously binding to the target analytes have been powerful technologies in molecular analyses. Recent developments in single molecule detection technologies enable the detection limit of the sandwich immunoassays approaching femtomolar (10\u201315 M), driving the needs of developing sensitive and specific antibodies for ever-increasingly broad applications in detecting and quantifying biomarkers. The key components underlying the sandwich immunoassays are antibody-based affinity reagents, for which the conventional sources are mono- or poly-clonal antibodies from immunized animals. The downsides of the animal-based antibodies as affinity reagents arise from the requirement of months of development timespan and limited choices of antibody candidates due to immunodominance of humoral immune responses in animals. Hence, developing animal antibodies capable of distinguishing highly related antigens could be challenging. To overcome the limitation imposed by the animal immune systems, we developed an in vitro methodology based on phage-displayed synthetic antibody libraries for diverse antibodies as affinity reagents against closely related influenza virus nucleoprotein (NP) subtypes, aiming to differentiating avian influenza virus (H5N1) from seasonal influenza viruses (H1N1 and H3N2), for which the NPs are closely related by 90\u201394% in terms of pairwise amino acid sequence identity. We applied the methodology to attain, within four weeks, a panel of IgGs with distinguishable specificities against a group of representative NPs with pairwise amino acid sequence identities up to more than 90%, and the antibodies derived from the antibody libraries without further affinity refinement had comparable affinity of mouse antibodies to the NPs with the detection limit less than 1 nM of viral NP from lysed virus with sandwich ELISA. The panel of IgGs were capable of rapidly distinguishing infections due to virulent avian influenza virus from infections of seasonal flu, in responding to a probable emergency scenario where avian influenza virus would be transmissible among humans overlapping with the seasonal influenza infections. The results indicate that the in vitro antibody development methodology enables developing diagnostic antibodies that would not otherwise be available from animal-based antibody technologies.",

            "text": "Multiple researchers have reported the development of monoclonal antibodies against viral antigens using hybridoma technology [21,36,49,50]. \n\nGeorge Smith invented the phage display technology in 1985 and revolutionized the process of discovery of antibodies for diagnostic, therapeutic, and basic research applications. This technology is based on the ability of bacteriophages to display foreign proteins, such as antibody fragments, on their surface. At the same time, they encode the gene inside the phage particle. Usually, M13 filamentous bacteriophage is used as the viral vector for displaying antibody fragments on its surface. The process involves the construction of a phage display library, which is a collection of millions to billions of different phage particles, each displaying a unique antibody fragment on its surface [Table 2]. Typically, such a library is generated by amplification of genes encoding antibody variable heavy and light chain domains from the B cells isolated from immunized (animals such as mice or convalescent humans) or non-immunized sources, followed by their PCR-based assembly and cloning in frame with the coat proteins (mostly g3 protein) of M13 bacteriophage. The resulting phage library is then subjected to biopanning, to eliminate non-binding or low-affinity phages, and recover target specific phages. After several rounds of biopanning, the individual phage clones displaying the desired antibody fragments are isolated, and the DNA encoding the antibody fragments is sequenced. \n\nAfter determining the sequences, the variable genes of antibodies can be subcloned into different expression systems. Recombinant monoclonal antibodies developed using phage display offer several advantages over traditional hybridoma-derived antibodies [Table 2]. These include improved stability, consistent quality, and the ability to engineer desired properties like higher affinity or specificity [51]. \n\nTypically, single B cell cloning technology involves the isolation of B cells from vaccinated or convalescent humans, followed by the sorting and culturing of B cells as single cells, screening of B cell supernatant for antibody specificity against the target, and cloning of antibody genes into mammalian expression vectors to produce full-length monoclonal antibodies [52,53].",

For this, Mario Geysen produced pathogen-defining \"Pepscans\" comprised of tiled overlapping synthetic-peptides that served as bait in solid phase immunoassays (15). Here, as an alternative to synthetic-peptides, we employ comprehensive phagedisplayed arrays of deconvoluted viral antigens, producing \"Domain-Scans\". The use of phage-display, as a means to present peptides for antibody interrogation, offers a number of advantages: (1) Peptides ranging from tens to hundreds of amino acids can easily be expressed; (2) Once cloned, the peptide library can be amplified to produce high titer-stock solutions that can be replenished endlessly; (3) The screening of phage-display peptide arrays can be conducted in small manageable micro-volumes, making phage-displayed Domain-Scans particularly amenable to high-throughput applications, screening numerous samples easily; (4) NGS multiplexing allows the analysis of the affinity-selected peptides, generating mega-data portraying a broader and more comprehensive view of the humoral immune response to infection and other morbidities. \n\nSuch application of NGS and T7 phage-display was reported previously by Xu and colleagues in their production of \"VirScans\" (16). The VirScan library contains a total of 93,904 56-mer peptides that correspond to over 1,000 strains of 206 human infectious viruses. Combined with NGS, Xu and colleagues have been able to study the diversity of viruses that infect human populations, survey the range that different viruses infect individuals and identify antigenic epitopes of diagnostic value (16). The application of the VirScans has already proven useful (17)(18)(19). \n\nIn this study, we created six phage-displayed Domain-Scans that represent two pathogens, HIV-1 and HCV, containing a total of 339 peptides of 15, 20, and 50 amino acids in length.",

The phage-based detection model can be a pragmatic solution to low-resource settings because phages are relatively easy to transport and store. In typical sandwich assay type systems, the reporter probe such as an enzyme-tagged antibody is commonly the self-life limiting component. The phage-based system can allow the use of enzymatic amplification steps without the need for storage concerns as the reporter is not synthesized until the phage encounters a host cell. The unique format of the bacteriophage detection schemes will allow future bacterial diagnostics to be performed relatively quickly and at low-cost.",

Antibody fragments, mostly singlechain variable fragments (scFv), have been widely used for various targets in biosensing applications where their small size in comparison with the intact IgG can be of advantage. 87 Other common recombinant antibody fragments include the heavychain antibodies (V HH ), also known as nanobodies or singledomain antibodies, which have gained significant attention due to their extraordinary structure that is completely devoid of the light chains. 66,93 Alternatively, short peptides originating from phage-displayed libraries have been introduced as an interesting alternative for the development of new biosensing platforms because of their small size and cost efficiency. Peptides often suffer from a poor or mediocre affinity in comparison with antibodies, which might limit their use in certain applications. Nevertheless, although the interactions of an individual peptide with its target might be weak, stronger binding has been achieved by multivalent display on the phage particles, resulting in significant avidity effects. Various recognition elements have been applied to biosensors in their phage-displayed format, but, on the other hand, once an individual target-specific phage has been identified, the phage itself becomes expendable. After identification, the recognition element thus may also be subcloned into an expression system for large-scale production and different downstream applications. Alternatively, short peptides can also be chemically synthesized via solid-phase peptide synthesis. \n\nRecombinant antibodies and short peptides originating from phage-displayed libraries have been reported in various biosensor applications, most notably in ELISA and surface plasmon resonance (SPR). 1 Furthermore, numerous different phage-based sensing schemes have been published recently using other transduction techniques, for example, fluorescence, Raman, quartz crystal microbalance, magnetoelastic, and electrochemical techniques. In this context, we will introduce a few interesting and recent applications for different kinds of targets (Table 1), but for a comprehensive overview of phagebased biosensors, we refer the reader to recent review articles. 7,91,92,94",

            "text": "Historically, vaccines usually comprise inactivated or attenuated forms of pathogens, but these can risk either not eliciting a sufficient robust immune response or can cause side effects. A recent review has highlighted the important role of phage display in identifying epitopes and mimotopes for vaccine development [242,243]. Specific epitopes have the potential to be engineered in the vaccine of interest to efficiently generate an immune response in the recipient. Random peptide sequences or even gene fragments have been displayed and screened using sera from patients or vaccinated individuals to identify pathogen epitopes for viruses, e.g. severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [244], influenza [245]; bacteria, e.g. Mycobacterium tuberculosis [246]; and parasites, e.g. Plasmodium falciparum [247]. The process is high throughput, cost effective, and can be customized to the pathogen in question enabling a viable alternative to the traditional route of vaccine development. Epitope identification by phage display has also enabled the generation of diagnostic assays for infectious diseases, as well as the development of vaccines. This strategy also offers the opportunity to directly use phage-based vaccines directly from the analysis following endotoxin removal [248], although this vaccine format has yet to be approved. The identification of key epitopes also assists the wider field of therapeutic discovery encompassing monoclonal antibodies (for example, to block an interaction), small molecules (for example, to disrupt the pathogen life cycle), and gene therapy (for example, by integrating a key epitope into the host cells, a sustained neutralizing immune response can be attained).",

            "text": "The procedure to generate mAbs is time consuming (2-3 months), labor intensive and requires immunization. Furthermore, all procedures to derive mAbs with specific recognition characteristics (e.g. recognizes target A, but not closely related target B) are carried out at the screening stage. Because of the limitations of the number of clones which can be grown up this limits the number of mAbs that can be assessed and the specificities that can be obtained. \n\nIn recent years, antibody phage display has become a very popular method to isolate specific antibodies, bypassing hybridoma technology and even the need for immunization. In general, libraries are made up of either single chain Fv (scFv) or Fab fragments, and comprise billions of different clones, from which specific binders can be isolated by recursive selection cycles. One of the advantages of using phage antibody libraries is that several antibody fragments, binding to different epitopes, are usually selected, providing a greater likelihood that useful binders will be obtained. Traditional screening methods involve ELISA, a time and cost ineffective way to analyze a large number of clones for binding specificity. We have recently reported a multiplex flow cytometry screening method [3] which allows the analysis of hundreds of clones for binding specificity by simultaneously assaying interaction with the target antigen and a vast array of negative controls. This method has led to the discovery of sets of scFvs with exquisite binding specificity to the target antigen and potentially binding multiple epitopes within the antigen. Using such in vitro methods for antibody fragments discovery has been extremely successful, however the use of scFv as reagents in research, diagnosis or detection has been limited by handling issues: low production levels, aggregation and poor stability in long-term storage. Where it is worth the additional effort, this problem has been overcome by the transformation of these antibody fragments into full-length antibodies. Unfortunately, this conversion is resource intensive and cannot be practically carried out on all selected antibody fragments. \n\nF1 antigen is a capsular protein unique to most Y. pestis [4,5,6,7,8] and therefore a good target for immunological detection of this microorganism.",

            "text": "The procedure to generate mAbs is time consuming (2-3 months), labor intensive and requires immunization. Furthermore, all procedures to derive mAbs with specific recognition characteristics (e.g. recognizes target A, but not closely related target B) are carried out at the screening stage. Because of the limitations of the number of clones which can be grown up this limits the number of mAbs that can be assessed and the specificities that can be obtained. \n\nIn recent years, antibody phage display has become a very popular method to isolate specific antibodies, bypassing hybridoma technology and even the need for immunization. In general, libraries are made up of either single chain Fv (scFv) or Fab fragments, and comprise billions of different clones, from which specific binders can be isolated by recursive selection cycles. One of the advantages of using phage antibody libraries is that several antibody fragments, binding to different epitopes, are usually selected, providing a greater likelihood that useful binders will be obtained. Traditional screening methods involve ELISA, a time and cost ineffective way to analyze a large number of clones for binding specificity. We have recently reported a multiplex flow cytometry screening method [3] which allows the analysis of hundreds of clones for binding specificity by simultaneously assaying interaction with the target antigen and a vast array of negative controls. This method has led to the discovery of sets of scFvs with exquisite binding specificity to the target antigen and potentially binding multiple epitopes within the antigen. Using such in vitro methods for antibody fragments discovery has been extremely successful, however the use of scFv as reagents in research, diagnosis or detection has been limited by handling issues: low production levels, aggregation and poor stability in long-term storage. Where it is worth the additional effort, this problem has been overcome by the transformation of these antibody fragments into full-length antibodies. Unfortunately, this conversion is resource intensive and cannot be practically carried out on all selected antibody fragments. \n\nF1 antigen is a capsular protein unique to most Y. pestis [4,5,6,7,8] and therefore a good target for immunological detection of this microorganism.",

Nanosized phages can display a certain length of exogenous peptides of arbitrary sequence or single-chain variable fragments (scFv) of antibodies that specifically bind to the targets of interest, such as animal cells, bacteria, viruses, and protein molecules. Metal nanoparticles generally have unique plasmon resonance effects. Metal nanoparticles such as gold, silver, and magnetism are widely used in the field of visual detection. A phage can be assembled with metal nanoparticles to form an organic\u2013inorganic hybrid probe due to its nanometer-scale size and excellent modifiability. Due to the unique plasmon resonance effect of this composite probe, this technology can be used to visually detect objects of interest under a dark-field microscope. In summary, this review summarizes the recent advances in the development of phage-based probes for ultra-sensitive detection of various bio-species, outlining the advantages and limitations of detection technology of phage-based assays, and highlighting the commonly used editing technologies of phage genomes such as homologous recombination and clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated proteins system (CRISPR-Cas).

            "text": "Phage display allows the generation of antibodies against nearly any target, including toxins, pathogens, non-immunogenic, or highly conserved antigens. With respect to protein targets, antibodies have been selected with exquisite specificity, differentiating, for example, between chicken and quail lysozyme 68 that differ by a single surface amino acid, and the SH2 domains of ABL1 and ABL2 69 , 70 . Phage antibody libraries have been widely used to select antibodies against infectious agents. These include antibodies that discriminate between different strains of Hantavirus 71 , Dengue virus 72 , influenza 73 , 74 , Ebola 75 and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus 76 . Given that many of these viruses are classified serologically, the ability to select phage antibodies with similar specificities is not surprising, but unlike antibodies generated by immunization, these have the potential to be used therapeutically. Human antibodies, some of which are protective in animal models 77 , 78 , 79 , have also been selected against a number of bacterial biothreat targets, including Brucella melitensis 80 , Burkholderia mallei and Burkholderia pseudomallei 81 , anthrax toxins 77 , 82 , 83 and spores 84 , and Botulinum toxin 24 , 85 . One library 79 was generated from servicemen vaccinated against a plethora of different biothreat agents, reflecting the additional ability of display technologies to exploit antibodies generated during traditional immunization. \n\nThe in vitro nature of phage display technology has been exploited to target particular features of blood cells. In one study 36 , antibodies recognizing fetal hemoglobin but not adult hemoglobin, were selected by depleting high affinity cross-reactive antibodies followed by a selection against the fetal protein. Notably, the selected discriminatory antibody was of much lower affinity than cross-reactive antibodies, demonstrating the power of negative selections to favor clones with desirable binding specificities, even if their affinity is lower. Similar methods applied to cells have been used to select antibodies specifically recognizing fetal nucleated red blood cells 95 . \n\nProtein allostery is a common means for the regulation of protein function, and many signaling proteins exist in alternative conformational states that mediate different cellular responses.",

            "text": "Arbovirus of the Flaviviridae family represents an issue worldwide, particularly because it can lead to serious illness and death in some countries. There is still a great complexity in obtaining effective therapies and specific and sensitive diagnostic tests, due to the high antigenic similarity between them. This similarity may account for antibodies cross reactivity which has positive and negative consequences for the course of infectious diseases. Among dengue virus (DENV) serotype infections, the cross-reactivity can increase virus replication and the risk of a severe disease by a mechanism known as an antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). The search for serological biomarkers through monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that identify unique viral regions can assist in the differential detection, whereas the development of recombinant antibodies with a neutralizing potential can lead to the establishment of efficacious treatments. The Phage Display methodology emerged as one of the main alternatives for the selection of human MAbs with high affinity for a specific target. Therefore, this technology can be a faster alternative for the development of specific diagnostic platforms and efficient and safe treatments for flavivirus infections. In this context, we propose for this chapter a discussion about Phage Display as a strategy to obtain MAbs for DENV and other flaviviruses.",

            "text": "Cholera, a persistent global public health concern, continues to cause outbreaks in approximately 30 countries and territories this year. The imperative to safeguard water sources and food from Vibrio cholerae, the causative pathogen, remains urgent. The bacterium is mainly disseminated via ingestion of contaminated water or food. Despite the plate method\u2019s gold standard status for detection, its time-consuming nature, taking several days to provide results, remains a challenge. The emergence of novel virulence serotypes raises public health concerns, potentially compromising existing detection methods. Hence, exploiting Vibrio cholerae toxin testing holds promise due to its inherent stability. Immunobiosensors, leveraging antibody specificity and sensitivity, present formidable tools for detecting diverse small molecules, encompassing drugs, hormones, toxins, and environmental pollutants. This review explores cholera toxin detection, highlighting phage display-based nano immunosensors\u2019 potential. Engineered bacteriophages exhibit exceptional cholera toxin affinity, through specific antibody fragments or mimotopes, enabling precise quantification. This innovative approach promises to reshape cholera toxin detection, offering an alternative to animal-derived methods. Harnessing engineered bacteriophages aligns with ethical detection and emphasizes sensitivity and accuracy, a pivotal stride in the evolution of detection strategies.

            "text": "This comprehensive review illuminates the unique perspective of phage display, establishing a direct connection between epitope identification and vaccine development to address a specific gap in the field. In Section 3.5, practical examples of epitope identification are presented using two key components, a phage display peptide or genome fragment library and samples from infected, convalescent, or vaccinated individuals. Successful identification of pathogen epitopes has been achieved by using antibodies from these patients. However, there is currently no example where phage display-based epitope identification has been followed by direct utilization of the identified and isolated phage clone as a vaccine. Only one clinical trial has been conducted using M13 vaccine for cancer patients [85]. The purpose of this study has been to highlight an approach that encompasses the entire process from epitope identification to vaccine production using a single technique, without requiring additional manipulation. Unlike conventional methods, phage display demonstrates exceptional efficiency and speed, proving particularly advantageous in critical scenarios such as pandemics. Notably, the timeline from selection to preclinical or clinical trials is significantly compressed, enabling the acquisition of a viable vaccine product within a matter of months instead of years. The review underscores the numerous advantages offered by phage display, encompassing expedited processes such as panning, characterization, sequencing, phage production, and endotoxin removal. By bridging this crucial knowledge gap, the review delivers invaluable insights into the remarkable potential of phage display for swift vaccine development. Undoubtedly, phage-based vaccines have the power to revolutionize the field of vaccinology, boasting immunogenic carrier capabilities, cost-effectiveness, and customization options that position them as a promising alternative to traditional vaccines. While further refinement and validation remain imperative, the advancements in phage display technology hold immense promise for the creation of precise and potent vaccines against infectious diseases.",

            "text": "Oligopeptide phage display has proven its power in several disease related fields which led to the identificationof various new antigens. The procedure is complementary to the widely spread classical identification of immunogenic proteins by pathogen cultivation, 2D-PAGE, immunoblot and mass spectrometry. Phage display allows the identification of immunogenic proteins which are low abundant proteins and which are only expressed during pathogen-host interaction. A limitation of oligopeptide phage display is the display itself. Oligopeptides which cannot be displayed on phage cannot be identified. This can be partially circumvented by applying display systems using different signal peptides. A further restriction of a prokaryote based system is the unability to display oligopeptides with posttranslational modifications, e.g. glycosylations. A major advantage of phage display libraries is the enormous number of different oligopeptides presented on phage that can be screened simultaneously. The development of ORF enrichment methods has improved the oligopeptide phage display system considerably making the screening of whole genomes for specific protein protein interactions possible. Phage display systems allow the identification of immunogenic peptides in a short period of time and only a manageable effort is needed. Newly identified immunogenic proteins provide information about the host-pathogen interaction and could be used for the development of new diagnostic tests and vaccines. The combination of oligopeptide phage display with antibody phage display leads to a complete vaccine pipeline. This pipeline can deliver new antigens for diagnostics and therapy as well as tailor made antibodies for diagnostic assays and passive immunisation.",

Currently, two recombinant antibodies are approved for the treatment of pathogens or toxins. Raxibacumab is a human antibody for anthrax treatment derived from a phage display library from Cambridge Antibody Technology (now Medimmune, part of AstraZeneca) in cooperation with Human Genome Science (now GlaxoSmithKline) [64]. The antibody palivizumab for the treatment of Respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis is a classical humanized antibody [65]. A further antibody, but also not derived from phage display, the Clostridium difficile antibody bezlotoxumab is in clinical phase 3 [66]. \n\nAn overview of recombinant antibodies derived from phage display against bacterial and viral pathogens, eukaryotic pathogens (parasites, fungi), and toxins as well as detailed examples for diagnostic and therapy are given in the next sections.",

            "text": "In particular, we were able to identify two pairs of anti-Etox monoclonal antibodies (clone 21 vs clone 149 and clone 22 vs clone 149) that gave limits of detection close to that obtained by antibody pairs isolated by standard hybridoma technology, reported to be 1-2 ng/ml (el Idrissi and Ward, 1992). Given that hybridoma-derived monoclonals have been affinity matured, the remarkable ability of our isolated pairs to achieve a 5-25 ng/ml limit of detection highlights the potential of the phage screening process for generating specific and high affinity antibodies rapidly. While our screening of anti-PA IgGs from the scFv library also identified functional pairs, these had a marginally poorer limit of detection at 300 ng/ml to 1 \u03bcg/ml. More importantly, these functional pairs required IgGs that had to be modified to remove their amber stop codons, thus reducing their suitability for rapid development into diagnostic reagents. These pairs also used an IgG that have a significant percentage of polypeptide chains bearing unnatural glycosylations within the CDRs (mJ3), which may render a portion of antibody molecules defective and reduce the functionality of the antibody. \n\nConsidering the comparative inefficiency of the synthetic libraries in generating functional antibodies, it might be advisable to use naturally-sourced antibody libraries where clones have been pre-selected by the immune system. The main advantage of synthetic libraries is the possibility of isolating 'self' antibodies which would normally be eliminated from natural libraries during negative selection to maintain tolerance. However, this would not be a consideration when screening for antibodies against foreign antigens. In conclusion, our study suggests that natural antibody libraries are preferable to synthetic repertoires for the rapid development of potential diagnostic antibodies to novel pathogens due to the ease and speed at which useful antibodies can be isolated.",

            "text": "The immunological method relies on the specific binding of antibodies to the antigens corresponding to specific pathogens [5]. It is a traditional clinical pathogen detection method including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [6,7], fluorescence and luminescence immunoassay [8,9], and immunoblotting [10]. Immunoassay-based technique is sensitive and easy to perform in a basic clinical laboratory but demands particular antibody-related production, storage, and handling procedures. The specificity of antibodies might also be compromised due to pathogen evolution [11]. Therefore, continuous efforts should be devoted to the development of rapid, sensitive, reliable, and cost-effective techniques for pathogen detection, especially those in response to a pandemic. \n\nBiosensor-based diagnostic represents an advanced technology in pursuit of rapid detection of various analytes including pathogens [12,13]. A typical biosensor is composed of immobilized bio-sensitive materials as recognition moieties and physical or chemical transducers that translate the recognition information into measurable signals. Commonly employed bio-recognition elements involve antibodies, nucleic acid derivatives, peptides, enzymes, and whole cells [14,15]. Aptamer-based biosensors, the so-called aptasensors, employ aptamers as the recognition moieties or bio-receptors to recognize and bind with targets of interest, followed by the translation and output of the recognition information into identifiable signals via versatile transducers [16,17]. According to signal transduction strategies (sensing mechanisms), they can be mainly classified into acoustic, electrochemical, and optical aptasensors. \n\nThis review article focuses on the design strategies as well as state-of-the-art technologies of aptasensor-based diagnostics for infectious pathogens (mostly bacteria and viruses). We intend to highlight the establishment of pathogen diagnostics and point-of-care testing (POCT) methodologies developed in recent years. Current technical barriers of aptamer-based technology are also discussed in the last section of the article, followed by representative solutions and future perspectives toward the implementation of aptamerbased biosensing technology into practical application.",

Therefore, there is a growing need to develop highly sensitive and selective virus detection methods that would be suitable for a wide range of applications, including disease diagnosis, pharmaceutical research, agriculture, and preventive measures. \n\nWe describe the advantages of phage display technology in the production of virusspecific antibodies, and we review what is known about virus detection with phage antibodies used in standard and sensor-based methods.",

            "text": "Phage display has become the most frequently used display technology, with the advantage of robustness due to high stability of the phage (Hoet et al., 2005). The in vitro methods employ a na\u00efve antibody library generated from donor-derived B cells, a synthetic library from synthetically derived diversity, or a semi-synthetic library derived from a combination of these two approaches, which differ in framework region (FR) composition and CDR diversification (Glanville et al., 2009;Hoogenboom, 2005;Kugler et al., 2015;Lloyd et al., 2009;Tiller et al., 2013;Zhai et al., 2011). The most commonly used antibody formats for phage display are single-chain Fv (scFv) and Fab. ScFv fragments are moderately stable on average and often have a high tendency to form multimers as well as aggregates, whereas Fab fragments have been found to possess comparably higher structural stability by an additional interface of the constant domains (Rothlisberger et al., 2005). For these reasons, Fab has replaced the scFv as a display format in many of recent phage libraries (Ponsel et al., 2011). \n\nIn this study, we constructed a large na\u00efve human Fab library (3 \uf0b4 10 10 colonies) from the peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs), lymph node, spleen, and bone marrow of 809 human donors and assessed available diversities of the VH and \u03ba VL (VK) repertoires in the entire library by 454 pyrosequencing. In addition, we validated the antibody library by selecting specific Fabs against 10 different therapeutically relevant antigens by phage display. The antibody library will be useful in the generation of human mAbs against diverse antigens, and the information about the diversity of natural antibody repertoires will be valuable in the future design of synthetic human antibody libraries with high functional diversity.",

            "text": "A recent meta-analysis [11] concluded that assays based on multiple antigens provided higher sensitivities and specificities than single antigen assays, with 38 kDa, Ag85B, a-crystallin and MPT51 being most effective [12]. An intrinsic problem with this approach is the variability in individual immune responses, differences in disease stages, and the time taken to develop an antibody response. Furthermore, antibody presence is not always indicative of an active TB infection. The second approach involves direct detection of the antigens themselves, rather than the antibodies that recognize them. Many have been assessed [13], with the detection of antigen 85 (Ag85) components directly in serum [14,15] being particularly diagnostic. \n\nAg85 comprises three related (71-77% homology) proteins of 30-32 kDa each: Ag85A, Ag85B, Ag85C [16], that are the most abundantly secreted M. tuberculosis proteins in vitro [17]. Ag85 and Ag85 RNA have been explored as potential biomarkers for TB in urine [18] and sera [14], with high sensitivity and specificity using indirect ELISA. Using commercially available antibodies on a waveguide biosensor platform we obtained a 500 fM limit of detection for Ag85. However, the application of this assay to clinical samples was prevented by poor antibody stability (Mukundan H. et al, Tuberculosis, in press, 2012), prompting the present study to develop antibodies for this significant biomarker. \n\nImmunological reagents used for infectious diagnosis typically comprise poly-or monoclonal antibodies from immunized animals. Recently antibodies have been developed using in vitro methods [19,20]. In phage display, antibodies of interest can be selected from large phage antibody libraries in only a few days, rather than the months required for immunization approaches. Yeast display has recently emerged as an alternative strategy, with one significant advantage over phage display: the ability to accurately control selection parameters by flow cytometry [21]. \n\nIn the present work, we take advantage of both selection approaches to isolate numerous single chain Fvs (scFvs) recognizing Ag85.",

            "text": "Therefore, this methodology might be used to obtain peptidomimetics of polysaccharides. This selection scenario is of particuar importance for the production of novel vaccines against encapsulated bacteria. The polysaccharide capsules of these bacteria often possess antigenic features. In this setting, RPLs have been exploited for the isolation of peptide mimics of the polysaccharide capsule of Neisseria meningitidis including serotypes A [102], B [103], and C [104] of this pathogenic bacterium. The mimotopes identified against these serotypes have been able to mount protective antibody responses in murine models. Phage display methodology can be exploited in another context to achieve vaccine candidates. Phage display libraries may be screened against a specific antiserum to recognize novel mimotopes. In this situation, the immune serum of convalescent individuals serves as the target of biopanning and thus potential vaccine candidates against a specific disease are isolated. This procedure can be performed without prior knowledge of the characteristics of protective antigen. In this regard, the screening of RPLs on serum derived from individuals with HIV-1 [105] and HBV infections [106] has led to the identification of peptidomimetics of some viral epitopes. The immunization of animal models with these peptide mimics has resulted in the production of virus-neutralizing antibodies. This approach has also been used against serum samples from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections and led to the identification of several antigens which encode outer membrane proteins and secreted proteins of the bacterium [107]. These antigens are suggested to be potential targets for vaccine generation against Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections. To increase the chance of isolating phage-displayed peptides with high affinity binding to disease-specific antibodies, the phage library can be first exposed to negative screening on sera from non-infected people followed by positive selection on sera from infected patients. This strategy has been used for the isolation of mimotopes against the parasite Brugia malayi (one of the causative agents of lymphatic filariasis) [108].",

            "text": "Phage or phagemids have been used to display scFv (McCafferty et al., 1990), Fab (Hoogenboom et al., 1991;Clackson et al., 1991), and combinatorial Fab or scFv immune antibody libraries (Burton and Barbas, 1994). For phagemid, libraries the phenotypic mixing in an E. coli host co-infected with helper phage results in the assembly of fully infectious phage particles. Eukaryotic and prokaryotic ribosome display systems have also been used to derive mAbs (He and Taussig, 1997;Hanes and Pluckthun, 1997, respectively). The in vitro linked transcription/ translation systems of ribosome display are not widely used compared to traditional phage display, and are not likely to become used for routine mAb development in the small research laboratory. \n\nThere are several unique advantages to the use of antibody libraries and recombinant antibody cloning. These include: (1) the ability to clone and express isotype specific libraries for selection of specific classes of mAb including IgA (Moreno de Alboran et al., 1995;Berry et al., 2003b) and IgE classes (Steinberger et al., 1996). Alternative isotypes can either be selected from a library made with a non-IgG class specific back primer corresponding to that isotype, or a mAb can be re-constructed to be a particular class by cloning the appropriate constant domains (Wolbank et al., 2003). Indeed, once a mAb is developed via either hybridoma or antibody libraries, recombinant antibody methods can be used to rapidly convert selected binding fragments to full length antibodies of any human or other animal\u00d5s isotype in vitro (Boel et al., 2000). ( 2) Antibody libraries affinity-select the binding clones from a library and do not merely screen for binding activity. The selection process progressively enriches binding clones. (3) The ability to re-screen recombinant antibody libraries. It is possible to freeze down libraries as cDNA and screen these again in the future.",

            "text": "Infectious agents, especially bacteria and viruses, account for a vast number of hospitalisations and mortality worldwide. Providing effective and timely diagnostics for the multiplicity of infectious diseases is challenging. Conventional diagnostic solutions, although technologically advanced, are highly complex and often inaccessible in resource-limited settings. An alternative strategy involves convenient rapid diagnostics which can be easily administered at the point-of-care (POC) and at low cost without sacrificing reliability. Biosensors and other rapid POC diagnostic tools which require biorecognition elements to precisely identify the causative pathogen are being developed. The effectiveness of these devices is highly dependent on their biorecognition capabilities. Naturally occurring biorecognition elements include antibodies, bacteriophages and enzymes. Recently, modified molecules such as DNAzymes, peptide nucleic acids and molecules which suffer a selective screening like aptamers and peptides are gaining interest for their biorecognition capabilities and other advantages over purely natural ones, such as robustness and lower production costs. Antimicrobials with a broad-spectrum activity against pathogens, such as antibiotics, are also used in dual diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Other successful pathogen identification strategies use chemical ligands, molecularly imprinted polymers and Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats-associated nuclease. Herein, the latest developments regarding biorecognition elements and strategies to use them in the design of new biosensors for pathogens detection are reviewed.",

            "text": "The present study describes a subtractive phage display strategy that led to the identification of novel antigens to aid in CVL serodiagnosis. The selected phage clones were able to discriminate the serum samples from L. infantum-infected dogs from the crossreactive serum samples infected by other parasites, as well as from the serum samples from vaccinated dogs using a phage-ELISA technique. Since its first description (36) and introduction into laboratory practice (37), phage display technology has proven to be useful in selecting specific peptides that are highly reactive against many pathogen targets. Its biological applications have ranged from use in studies of vaccine candidates for rabies (38), hepatitis C (39), E. coli (40), Plasmodium vivax (23), and Schistosoma japonicum (41) to use with diagnostic antigens for the detection of antibodies to pneumonia (42), neurocysticercosis (43)(44)(45), equine viral arteritis (46), rabies (47), and anaplasmosis (48). These phage-displayed peptides, also called mimotopes, have shown either linear or conformational recognition with high affinity to paratope sequences of antibodies. In this context, the present study used a subtractive approach through phage display in order to identify new antigens for the serodiagnosis of CVL so as to identify phage clones that express target peptides capable of being recognized by antibodies present in the serum samples from L. infantum-infected dogs. Aimed at identifying more refined antigens for CVL serodiagnosis, the selected phage clones were tested in a serological panel in phage-ELISAs. Serological tests are currently recommended for the laboratorial diagnosis of CVL. IFAT and ELISA are the most widely used diagnostic assays that are applicable to leishmaniasis; however, their low sensitivities for detecting cases with low levels of Leishmania-specific antibodies, as well as their cross-reactivity with other diseases, including Chagas' disease represent important limitations for their use in the CVL serodiagnosis (49,50).

            "text": "The antibody library is a powerful tool for the discovery and development of targetspecific antibodies for a wide range of applications.This includes not only research into the structure and function of proteins and pathological mechanisms of diseases but also into the development of diagnostics and therapeutic interventions [7,37].Thus, the construction of a high-quality library with a larger and more diverse antibody repertoire is essential for increasing the chances of finding high-affinity antibodies with various paratopes that bind to the diverse epitopes of target antigens [38][39][40].In this study, following in vitro immunization of hPBMCs, we constructed a large human combinatorial scFv library and comprehensively analyzed the characteristics of the newly constructed library using NGS.Finally, isolation and biochemical characterization of phage display-derived human scFvs specific to two therapeutically relevant target antigens, including the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant BA.2 and immune checkpoint protein CD155, were conducted for the quality assessment of the library.\n\nTraditionally, mAbs with high affinity and selectivity have been generated from an antibody library, produced by the conventional immunization of animals with diverse antigens [7,41,42].However, the method is labor-intensive and time-consuming and requires the additional establishment of a recombinant antibody library.Further, the mAbs derived from animals also have a higher immunogenicity risk, a major hurdle in the development of therapeutic antibodies [6].To overcome this hurdle, a human na\u00efve or synthetic antibody library has been constructed to isolate target-specific human antibodies [43][44][45].Although vaccination in humanized mouse models is also used as another reliable method for the generation of human mAbs, based on our previous work and similar reports by others, phage display-based antibody selection from an established antibody library can considered a faster and more efficient approach to isolating human recombinant mAbs than the antibody selection from the immune library [8,46,47].Therefore, we believe that the antibody phage display library generated in this study may be widely used as a novel rapid screening platform to select target-specific phage display-derived mAbs for use in multiple applications.",

            "text": "Phage display is essential in the field of bioengineering and immunology and is also used for development of vaccines and drug molecules. 76,77 e of the outstanding advantages of phage display over other nanotechnology platforms is that it provides rapid and uniform replication for sustainable and cost-effective production on a larger scale. 78  important step of vaccine development is to select the appropriate antigen and adjuvant. Phage-based vaccination is achieved by exposing multiple foreign antigen copies on the capsid surface of immunogenic particles to obtain an effective immune response. The combinatorial peptide libraries of the phage display techniques also help to identify promising vaccine candidates against different diseases, particularly against microbial infections. Based on an affinity selection strategy, these libraries are screened to select mimotopes with high antigenicity and immunogenicity. 79 ncer immunotherapy is considered a promising approach to treat cancer as an alternative to or in addition to chemotherapy and radiation because of its ability to minimize systematic side effects. 80 Current experiments on animal models are focused on several concepts of this anti-cancer immune response, and the phage display platform is modified to match each concept. In one such concept, tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) are considered as rational targets for cancer treatment. \n\nThus, the biopanning process of phage display toward monoclonal as well as polyclonal antibodies (Abs) could be performed to detect TAA mimotopes. 81,82 A better solution is to produce anti-TAA Abs continuously and endogenously in a process called active vaccination. It aims both to eliminate cancer and to decrease the risk of recurrence. 83 In this case, utilization of phages as vaccine carriers stimulates both CD4 + and CD8 + T lymphocytes and induces strong cytotoxic responses. 84,85 The goal of active vaccination is to use peptides derived from phage display to indirectly promote the immune response via its checkpoint inhibitors or to modulate immune cell activity. 72  the field of infectious diseases, an ideal treatment of an infection involves a specifically targeted antibiotic to kill the pathogen instead of broad-spectrum ones, as broad-spectrum antibiotics could lead to antibiotic resistance.",

            "text": "Bacteriophages have been suggested as natural food preservatives as well as rapid detection materials for food-borne pathogens in various foods. Since Listeria monocytogenes-targeting phage cocktail (ListShield) was approved for applications in foods, numerous phages have been screened and experimentally characterized for phage applications in foods. A single phage and phage cocktail treatments to various foods contaminated with food-borne pathogens including E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella enterica, Campylobacter jejuni, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Cronobacter sakazakii, and Vibrio spp. revealed that they have great potential to control various food-borne pathogens and may be alternative for conventional food preservatives. In addition, phage-derived endolysins with high host specificity and host lysis activities may be preferred to food applications rather than phages. For rapid detection of food-borne pathogens, cell-wall binding domains (CBDs) from endolysins have been suggested due to their high host-specific binding. Fluorescence-tagged CBDs have been successfully evaluated and suggested to be alternative materials of expensive antibodies for various detection applications. Most recently, reporter phage systems have been developed and tested to confirm their usability and accuracy for specific detection. These systems revealed some advantages like rapid detection of only viable pathogenic cells without interference by food components in a very short reaction time, suggesting that these systems may be suitable for monitoring of pathogens in foods. Consequently, phage is the next-generation biocontrol agent as well as rapid detection tool to confirm and even identify the food-borne pathogens present in various foods.",

            "text": "Rapid detection of pathogenic bacteria is crucial in minimizing the risk of bacterial diseases and food poisoning. Many of the conventional microbiological and biochemical detection methods are laborious, require skilled individuals, relatively slow, and are not always accurate. The specificity of host by phages' , dependence of phage replication on bacterial metabolism, and high burst size make phages an ideal platform to develop rapid detection systems with high sensitivity, stability, versatility, selectivity, and long shelf-life (Hussain et al., 2021). Another benefit in utilizing phage for detection is the genetically engineered reporter phages detect only viable bacteria because phage can only be multiplied in viable hosts, while other detection methods detect bacteria regardless of their viability (Kim et al., 2014). A challenge with genetically engineered reporter phages however is wide application, reporter phages have a narrow host range and detection. In addition to a whole phage, phage components such as tails, tail fibers, cell wall binding domain (CBD) of endolysin can be utilized to make systems for rapid detection of bacteria. These proteins can efficiently replace antibodies because some CBDs are highly specific and their binding affinity to target bacteria is higher than antibodies used for routine diagnostics (Kong et al., 2017). Production of recombinant CBD is considerably easier compared with antibodies, further highlighting their potential benefit for diagnostics. However, despite the great benefits of utilizing phages for diagnostics, the limited availability of CBDs targeting varieties of pathogenic bacteria have been hampering their applications and further research on phage biology is needed.",

First, phages are relatively easy to produce as they are readily propagated in the presence of their host and can be subsequently purified for use. A second advantage is that phage are host specific, and a single or multiple phage types can be used to target a specific bacterial strain, species, or group of closely related bacterial species. The successful use of reporter-tagged phage for bacterial detection has been demonstrated using both fluorescent 7 and enzymatic 8 tags. The VIDAS\u00ae UP by Biom erieux (St. Louis, MO) is a commercially available detection platform that utilizes reporter-tagged phage components as detector probes in an ELISA format for the detection of Salmonella, E. coli O157:H7, and Listeria with reported superior performance to PCR-based methods. 9 Phage-display schemes have also allowed for the development of novel phage-based probes by enabling the bioengineering of phage capsids to incorporate proteins with affinities to chemicals and molecule unrelated to bacterial detection. 10",

            "text": "The demand for recombinant antibodies is increasing due to their broad applications from diagnostics to therapy; a fact clearly demonstrated by the growing marked for antibody based drugs 1,2 with more and more drugs in this class progressing through clinical trials. Many of those exploit fulllength antibodies produced in eukaryotic hosts to yield human or human like glycosylations. However, where effector functions are not necessary, minimized phage display derived modules like singlechain fragment variables (scFv) or fragment antigen binding (Fab or scFab), which retain the antigen-binding specificity without the fragment crystallizable (Fc) element, are advantageous. From an ethical point of view the phage display approach can help to reduce the amount of animal experiments in medical research. Furthermore, because the DNA sequence encoding the antibody is available, the small fragments offer numerous ways for the engineering and modification of biophysical properties to suit their operation purpose 3,4 and are eligible for production at low costs and fast production cycles in microbial systems. 5 These advantages however, are impaired by the often poor levels of soluble antibody fragments in prokaryotic production systems and the necessity of time consuming improvement approaches like codon-optimization or excessive screening of culture and expression conditions. 6,7 ewly introduced inducible scFv expression plasmid constructs expand the established production host range. Phage display selected human scFvs 7,8 directed against a human cancer marker protein and potential therapeutic target, Mucin1, 9,10 an \"acutephase\" inflammation indicator in the human blood, C-reactive protein 11 and a murine anti-hen egg-white lysozyme model antibody, D1.3 7,[12][13][14][15] were used to assess the functionality of those new constructs. A feature of the plasmids is the chassis that is based on the wellstudied RK2 broad host range plasmid which therefore should allow replication, maintenance and expression of scFvs in the majority of Gram-negative bacteria. 16",

(2024) 19 (9), 811-824 ISSN 1746-0913 811 10.2217/fmb-2023-0246 C 2024 The Authors routes, including water, food, air and clinical settings. Phage therapeutics has emerged as a highly debated and explored topic, with the fundamental understanding of phage biology, its life cycle, and interactions with host bacteria shedding light on its potential as a bio-probe or assay [7,8]. This potential holds promise in addressing persistent challenges associated with infections, whether they are foodborne, airborne, waterborne or clinical in nature. The inherent qualities of phages, such as their self-replicating ability and host-specific nature, position them as a valuable tool in combating these infectious threats [9,10]. Phage-based diagnostics offer a captivating aspect of achieving unparalleled levels of specificity and sensitivity while minimizing both cost and time requirements. The ingenious utilization of the phage display technique further enhances the diagnostic potential [11]. This technique involves the incorporation of a protein of interest into the phage coat protein, resulting in the external display of the protein. This connection between genotype and phenotype showcases the fusion of genetic information with observable characteristics. By exploiting this technique, phage-based diagnostics can leverage the unique properties of phages to precisely target and identify specific pathogens or molecules of interest [11,12]. This approach promises to revolutionize the field of diagnostics by providing a powerful tool that combines the advantages of phage biology with the precision of molecular recognition, ultimately enhancing our ability to detect and diagnose a wide range of infections and diseases [13]. Phage display platforms offer a versatile approach for screening phages against a variety of DNA sequences, peptides and proteins [10,14]. This technique involves the presentation of diverse peptides or proteins on the surface of phages, which can then be subjected to interactions with specific target entities. By measuring the interactions between these displayed proteins and the desired targets, researchers can gain valuable insights into molecular binding, recognition, and potential applications.",

Phages are viruses that infect bacteria by adhering to specific host cell surface receptors. A simple model for reporter phage design is that the presence of the correct epitope induces the transfer of the phage genome into bacteria, triggering bioluminescence from luciferase in the target bacteria. 72,73 Bioluminescent reporter-based phages have been applied for the diagnosis of pathogens such as Bacillus anthracis, 74,75 Vibrio parahaemolyticus, 76 Salmonella typhimurium, 77 pathogenic Escherichia coli, 78,79 and Staphylococcus aureus. 80 For example, an engineered Yersinia pestis phage was used for the detection of an etiologic agent in bubonic plague. 81 A microscopy-based method in association with the fluoromycobacteriophage mCherrybomb\u03d5 was used to diagnose M. tuberculosis. 82 Recently, Meile et al. engineered a set of nanoluciferase (NLuc)-based phage reporters to identify and differentiate Listeria monocytogenes in potentially contaminated milk, cold food, and other eatable samples. 83 These NLuc-based reporter phages enabled rapid and ultrasensitive detection of one CFU of L. monocytogenes in 25 g of artificially contaminated natural food in less than 24 h. Phages can also be exploited as bioelectrode elements by immobilizing them to an electrode surface or utilizing lytic phages to infect target bacteria to release bacterial cell contents such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for electrochemical detection. 84 iyomdecha et al. used an M13 bacteriophage-modified electrode for the detection of Salmonella spp.: this biosensor binds to target bacteria through the amino acid groups on the filamentous phage. 85 Farooq et al. mobilized S. aureus-specific lytic phages in surface-modified bacterial cellulose (BC) matrix conducted by carboxylated multi-walled carbon nanotube (c-MWCNTs).",

            "text": "In this study, we constructed a polyvalent antigen display system based on the M13 bacteriophage. We show here that the recombinant antigen could be displayed on the surface of the phage and identified by antibodies. Interestingly, we observed binding activity between ACE2 and the phage that displayed the RBD region of SARS-CoV-2. These data demonstrated that the phage-displayed antigen has properties similar to the protein found on the viral membrane. Based on this result, the phage-displayed antigen can be used not only to detect lineardirected antibodies but also in some research that requires the correct structure. For example, Uppalapati et al. (2022) reconstituted the receptor-binding motif (RBM) of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) by phagedisplay conformer libraries and selected two reconstituted RBM conformers that cross-reacted with a panel of 7 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. Combined with phage display selection, phage display antigen libraries can also be used to predict RBD constructs that have a higher affinity for ACE2. \n\nTo isolate biomolecules with high affinity, the dual plasmid helper phage display system has been used for phage display selection (Kumar et al., 2022); compared with this, the polyvalent display system can reduce nonspecific binding and has more advantages in diagnostic assays. In this research, our system could identify antibodies that target more than three antigens in the same multiplex real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR. Several studies have shown that serological assays based on multiple antigens can indeed increase the specificity of testing and provide a more comprehensive picture of the humoral immune response (Gillot et al., 2020). For example, the research of Grossberg et al. (Grossberg et al., 2021) showed that the antibody levels of S1-RBD IgA, NP IgG, and S2 IgA can be used to identify severe, mild, and asymptomatic groups of COVID-19 patients.",

Though these standard detection methods are sensitive, they lag behind in terms of detection time, taking from several hours to days to yield a response (Velusamy et al. 2010). Conventional analytical techniques like optical, chromatographic and electrochemical detection are faster, but have some limitations of equipment and cost. Furthermore, they are complicated and require highly trained personnel and extensive sample preparation. These constraints do not always allow frequent, real time or in situ monitoring of food or clinical samples. Thus, demands of high sensitivity, specificity, costeffective, portable and rapid analyses have propelled the development of biosensors as novel diagnostic tools in the medical and food sectors. Many diagnostic tools still rely on immunoassays and especially enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Besides these classical tests, several phage and aptamer based sensors have also been proposed for a broad range of disease biomarkers or carriers such as antibodies, viruses, disease-related proteins, tumour cells, toxins and pathogens, among several others. The precise detection of these biomarkers or carriers before the onset of a disease can significantly revolutionise the medical field by providing cheap, fast, simple and easily produced diagnostic tests using phages and aptamers as their recognition elements. The wide range of assays that employ phages or aptamers to detect important clinical molecules, highlights the potential of these new receptors in clinical diagnostic tests and in food biosensors. This chapter will define phages and aptamers and discuss their use as novel biorecognition elements in biosensors. We discuss two relevant cases in the field of biosensors: the use of diagnostics for clinical testing and the use of biosensors for food-related testing.",

            "text": "Our results are in agreement with other researchers who have also obtained sensitive ELISA detection using phage-displayed antibody fragments rather than the soluble antibody fragments [28,29]. For example, using phage sdAb reagents in ELISAs led to the detection of ~1 pfu of Marburg virus, while use of a sdAb-alkaline phosphatase fusion led to the detection of ~10 pfu [29]. Because of the small size of the sdAb, the sites available for modification (i.e. biotinylation) are limited. In contrast, phage-displayed reporter elements have the advantage of being very large. M13 phage has a length of 900 nm but a width of only 8 nm; its length is made up of ~2,700 copies of pVIII, the major phage coat protein, which has a 5 kDa molecular weight. SdAb are expressed attached to one of five copies of pIII, one of the minor coat proteins found on one of the phage's ends [30,31]. Thus, there is the potential for the attachment of many more biotin per phage than per sdAb and hence the binding of more streptavidin-HRP or SA-PE, resulting in an amplified signal. The anti-phage HRP used in the first experiments is directed against the pVIII and again the potential exists for multiple anti-phage HRP to bind on each phage detection reagent.",

With their vital roles in these fields, mimotopes emerge as a crucial asset (38)(39)(40). Nano immunosensors offer a promising departure from traditional immunoassays in toxin detection. By emulating toxin epitopes and mirroring their properties, nano immunosensors replace toxins or toxin-derived reagents in non-toxic analysis (41,42). Notably, simulated peptides and anti-idiotype antibodies currently underpin toxin immunoassay development (43,44). Incorporating a wide array of applications, phage display technology spans epitope mapping (45), enzymatic functions (46), targeted drug delivery (47,48), and protein interaction definition (49,50). \n\nRecent research has centered on phage display-based nano immunosensors for cholera toxin detection. Utilizing phagedisplayed peptides to mimic cholera toxin epitopes, these immunosensors enable rapid, sensitive, and specific detection in water samples. Nevertheless, challenges remain, necessitating improved stability and sensitivity, optimized detection conditions, and reduced production costs. Notwithstanding, phage displaybased nano immunosensors exhibit promising potential, offering a new, safe, and swift detection technology for ensuring environmental water safety.

In particular, immunisation with pDNA-EC2 or pDNA-EC3 lead to 84.7% and 93.5% reduction of brain cyst load, respectively, compared to the animals vaccinated with empty vector, thus further supporting the use of antigen fragments and/or immunodominant epitopes selected and characterized using the lambda display technology in vaccine applications. Although phage display technology was introduced twenty years ago, the possible applications of this biological approach have been continuously in practice. Exploitation of phage display has lead to the isolation and production of a broad range of molecules, including recombinant antibodies and antigens, with predefined specificity. \n\nThe experimental successes achieved by the use of lambda display strongly confirm the great value of this technology in studying protein-protein interactions and, particularly, in antigen discovery. With respect to classical technologies, the lambda display approach gives a high chance to identify large panels of antigenic regions and immunodominant epitopes in a short period of time and at very low cost, and it is a powerful method for identifying sequences from large repertoires such as those derived from libraries of cDNA or whole genomes (i.e., viruses and prokaryotes). Moreover, lambda display libraries can be easily screened against complex mixtures, such as antibodies present in sera from infected individuals. Finally, the antigenic regions characterised by lambda display may constitute powerful leads for improving diagnosis, prophylaxis and therapy of life-threatening diseases induced by human pathogens (Figure 4).

            "text": "There is a high level of variety in the development of phage-based biosensors for rapid, sensitive, and specific methods of detection. Phage-based biosensors could introduce new frontiers in diagnostic technologies. The unique characteristics of phages include their attack on only live bacteria, the possibility of tailoring them by genetic modification, and the combination with the leading sensor platforms in ways that emphasize the key role in the development of diagnostics. \n\nWith infectious diseases on the rise, there has never been a time when timely diagnosis was so important for competent infection management. Phage-based biosensors meet these challenges with rapid detection and point-of-care analysis, particularly needed in low-resource situations. The combination of phage specificity with recent improvements in sensor technology makes the route to diagnostic tool realization promising for meeting urgent needs for rapid and reliable detection. \n\nTherefore, such high specificity of phages means that their application in biosensors will be associated with a decrease in false positives and an increase in diagnostic accuracy. Further support for the effective immobilization of phages is given by innovations in the materials used for sensors, such as gold, magnetic-based, and carbon-based substrates. Each of these substrates has different advantages in terms of sensitivity, scalability, and integration, which will realize the full potential of phage-based sensors. \n\nGiven these strengths, phage stability and sensitivity to drying have been the challenges. With modification techniques' advent such as genetic and chemical, besides material sciences that progress, these weaknesses started to be overcome. It would be possible to continue future research beyond the already achieved phage stability under fluctuating environmental conditions and new materials to optimize phage immobilization for consistent performance. \n\nThe promising availability of complex analytes denotes the ability of multiplexed biosensors, which have the potential to detect multiple pathogens simultaneously through immobilization with different phages. The systems are designed based on several technical considerations, such as reducing cross-reactivity and signal interference. However, they hold great promise for clinical diagnostics, enabling comprehensive detection in a single assay. \n\nFinally, the broad challenges to the development and wide diffusion of phage-based biosensors remain.",

            "text": "Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) is an important porcine pathogen that causes diseases in both swine and human. For rapid SS2 identification, a novel latex agglutination test (LAT) based on heavy-chain variable domain antibody (VH) was developed. Firstly, the soluble 47B3 VH antibody fragment from a phage display library, in which cysteine residues were engineered at the C-terminus, was expressed in Escherichia coli. The purified protein was then gently reduced to form monomeric soluble 47B3 VH subsequently used to coat with latex beads by means of site-specific conjugation. The resulting VH-coated beads gave a good agglutination reaction with SS2. The LAT was able to distinguish S. suis serotype 2 from serotype 1/2, which shares some common sugar residues, and showed no cross-reaction with other serotypes of S. suis or other related bacteria. The detection sensitivity was found to be as high as 1.85x106 cells. The LAT was stable at 4\u00b0C for at least six months without loss of activity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first LAT based on a VH antibody fragment that can be considered as an alternative for conventional antibody-based LAT where VHs are the most favored recombinant antibody.",

            "text": "In the next step, the surface coated by antigen is exposed to phage library, then, stringent washing of the surface is performed to remove nonbinding antibody phage. Subsequently, elution of the bound antibody phage is conducted by methods like pH shift or by using trypsin, and then, reamplification is done by infection of Escherichia coli. Reamplified phage will be used in the next round of panning. It is expected that after each round of panning, the number of specific binding phages is increased. After 3-5 panning rounds, antigen-specific antibody phage will be checked by several methods such as ELISA, immunoblotting, or flow cytometry (Bazan et al., 2012). This approach is similarly done for the production of both therapeutic and diagnostic antibodies (Schirrmann et al., 2011;Frenzel et al., 2017). \n\nThe phage display technique has been widely used for detecting various targets, such as haptens, toxins, foreign and selfantigens (Tullila and Nevanen, 2017;Hussack et al., 2018;Raeisi et al., 2022a). For example, a specific antibody against a tumor marker expressed by breast tumor, named ErBb2 protein, has been selected through na\u00efve antibody library that is useful in immunoassay tools (Bakir et al., 1993). Furthermore, many rAbs derived from page libraries have been examined for diagnosis or therapy of bacterial diseases; the majority of these rAbs have been developed to facilitate disease detection and estimate the presence of contamination in environmental and food samples or levels of sample contamination (Kuhn et al., 2016;Priyanka et al., 2016). These rAbs are usually designed for various purposes, including detection of whole bacterial cells or toxins, blocking receptors, and modulating the host immune system (Kuhn et al., 2016), among them, whole bacterial cells are mostly applied for diagnostics (Byrne et al., 2013). An overview of rAbs derived from phage display libraries against C. difficile is presented in Table 3.",

            "text": "There are numerous molecular methods available for the molecular analysis and diagnosis of pathogens. Two key technologies in widespread use target nucleic acids using PCR-based methods and proteins using a range of antibody-based techniques. Both approaches have their distinct advantages and disadvantages: PCR assays are easier to develop, are generally more sensitive, but detection of DNA does not prove the presence of a viable, infectious pathogen and that of RNA provides no information about protein functionality. Antibody-based tests can give a result in less than five minutes (e.g. a lateral flow device) and have a low target purity requirement, but can be difficult to develop and the quality of the test depends on the quality of the antibody.\n\nImmuno-PCR [16] and real-time immuno-qPCR (iqPCR) [17] represent the first attempts to combine the advantages of the two approaches whilst overcoming the limitations associated with traditional immunoassays. However, the sensitivity and specificity of iqPCR assays as originally developed are antibody-dependent and do not necessarily exceed that of the conventional ELISA because both are reduced by nonspecific background signals [18] probably caused by cross-reactive binding of the single antibody to nontarget proteins [19]. Nonetheless, appropriately designed sandwich formats can improve the sensitivity of iPCR to make them 1000 -fold or more sensitive than ELISAs [20]. However, the most limiting aspect of iPCR are (i) that its workflow involves a multi-step process that results in significant hands-on time requirements and introduces the potential for contamination and (ii) that there is an enhanced consumption of reagents [21].\n\nIn contrast, PLA is a homogeneous assay that uses two interacting proximity probes to generate a signal and has significant potential to improve the sensitivity of detection [1]. Indeed, PLA has been used for a wide variety of applications that range from detection of proteins in single cells [22], cancer biomarkers [23] and prions [24] to proposals for its use with personalised medicine [25]. However, apart from a report detailing the proof of principle for the detection of bacteria, [4], there is only one other report of its use to detect pathogenic Escherichia coli [5].\n\nThe emergence",

            "text": "Genetically modified bacteriophages are employed in several fields, such as in phage therapy as a source of new antimicrobials; in the development of biosensor devices for health and environmental purposes, and as genetic engineering tools themselves 34 . In this context, synthetic biology refers to the rational design, or de novo addition of functional genes according to the specific area of study. Genetic modification of the phage genome has been widely used to overcome limitations of natural bacteriophages 35,36 . For example, Ka\u017amierczak and colleagues recently cloned the red fluorescent protein gene with the hoc gene of the T4 phage. This resulted in the creation of a fluorescent phage, which can be observed in vivo in mice 36 . Conversely, phage display systems have been instrumental in uncovering mechanisms of molecular interaction, particularly in the fields of antigen discovery, vaccine development, protein interaction, and cancer diagnosis and treatment [37][38][39] . In this case, exogenous peptides or entire antibodies of interest can be selected from a large library of phage particles by screening for affinity against desiderated targets 40 . The selected whole phage or partial phage particle can be used as a probe in phage-based biosensor platforms. \n\nTraditionally, the phage-probe must be linked to a transducer, which converts the occurred interaction between phage and target into a detectable signal 41,42 . Several transducer systems have been used in combination with phage-probes. These include the detection of a colorimetric or luminescent signal by ELISA using an antibody against the phage or a phage labeled with fluorochromes 43,44 . Furthermore, viral DNA detection by PCR or physical signal by raman and sers-raman analysis have also been used. However, these transducer systems often make the process time-consuming and expensive 45,46 . To overcome this limitation, in this study, we used the M13K07 helper phage as a backbone to design a fluorescent helper vector to use in combination with phagemid vectors thereby obtaining a dual display phage. We manipulated the M13K07 helper phage genome by Gibson assembly 28 .",

            "text": "The discovery of hybridoma technology, described by Kohler and Milstein in 1975, and the resulting ability to generate monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) initiated a new era in antibody research and clinical development. However, limitations of the hybridoma technology as a routine antibody generation method in conjunction with high immunogenicity responses have led to the development of alternative approaches for the streamlined identification of most effective antibodies. Within this context, display selection technologies such as phage display, ribosome display, yeast display, bacterial display, and mammalian cell surface display have been widely promoted over the past three decades as ideal alternatives to traditional hybridoma methods. The display of antibodies on phages is probably the most widespread and powerful of these methods and, since its invention in late 1980s, significant technological advancements in the design, construction, and selection of antibody libraries have been made, and several fully human antibodies generated by phage display are currently approved or in various clinical development stages. With evolving novel disease targets and the emerging of a new generation of therapeutic antibodies, such as bispecific antibodies, antibody drug conjugates (ADCs), and chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapies, it is clear that phage display is expected to continue to play a central role in antibody development. Nevertheless, for non-standard and more demanding cases aiming to generate best-in-class therapeutic antibodies against challenging targets and unmet medical needs, in vivo phage display selections by which phage libraries are directly injected into animals or humans for isolating and identifying the phages bound to specific tissues offer an advantage over conventional in vitro phage display screening procedures. Thus, in the present review, we will first summarize a general overview of the antibody therapeutic market, the different types of antibody fragments, and novel engineered variants that have already been explored. Then, we will discuss the state-of-the-art of in vivo phage display methodologies as a promising emerging selection strategy for improvement antibody targeting and drug delivery properties.",

            "text": "The Ni-NTA MBs were heterogeneous, relatively large, and exhibited Ni-NTA ligands for affinity coating. The advantage of Ni-NTA MBs is their convenient coating procedure, high sedimentation ratio, and low surface/volume ratio; however, their unstable CBD binding precluded their further use for the isolation of whole bacterial cells at low concentrations (unpublished data). In contrast, eMBs are small, hydrophilic, polystyrene-coated particles whose specific surface chemistry allows for covalent protein immobilization [24]. These particles offer further advantages, including a low sedimentation ratio (increased availability of the coated surface), high stability, and high surface/volume ratio [25]. \n\nOur study demonstrated that phage proteins can be used as recognition molecules for the detection of bacteria. The receptor binding proteins, endolysin CBDs, and even whole phages are strong candidates for use as specific detection tools [26,27]. The CBDs of phage endolysins have been successfully used to detect various grampositive bacteria, such as Listeria spp. [28], Bacillus cereus [29], and Clostridium tyrobutyricum [30]. Antibodies, which have previously been used as specific binders, may exhibit cross reactivity and cause protein instability; moreover, the procedures for their preparation are expensive [31]. Therefore, the smaller and more stable CBDs offer advantages as specific binders. We used protein-coated MBs in this study, but other technical tools can be used; for example, biosensors and quantum dots labeling. \n\nClinical diagnosis of bacterial infections depends on various culture-independent diagnostic tests, such as nucleic acid amplification or ELISA-based antigen detection, MALDI-TOF MS, and whole-genome sequencing [32,33]. These approaches may enable automated, reproducible, and easier detection of pathogen while allowing sensitive detection of nonculturable organisms and polymicrobial infections (multiplex detection). However, the specificity of these approaches may be affected by the detection of closely related nontarget species, which may lead to false-positive results [32,34].",

We chose scFv over Fab fragments because they could easily be integrated in a phage display protocol as scFvs have a higher stability for panning while their single peptide character allows for bacterial expression in a functional form. Furthermore, optimization of affinity and specificity is cost-efficient. 28 oreover, scFv have been shown to provide better pharmacokinetic features than mAbs or IgGs, stressing their potential benefits for diagnostic applications. 29 ere, we aimed at closing the diagnostic gap for USUV infections by generating, with the assistance of phage display technology, USUV-specific scFv antibodies that do not cross-react with WNV. We describe here the isolation and characterization of four scFv antibodies derived from a chicken library that recognize the domain III (DIII) of the USUV E protein with nanomolar affinities and up to a 50 fold higher specificity to USUV than WNV as well as on antibody that recognizes the E protein DIII of both USUV and WNV with similar affinities.",

Biosurveillance and clinical diagnosis of these pathogens traditionally relied on microbiological, clinical, molecular, and immunological approaches using a variety of platforms and assays. Phage-based detection of these pathogens is still not commonplace and has relied on conventional culture-based plaque assays. Recent more modern rapid approaches include detection of genomic or protein components that exploit the amplification of these components during the active growth of phages inside a given bacterium. Other approaches use reporter phages or very rarely sensor-based approaches. A more comprehensive phage-based rapid and plug and play platform technology for the entire biodefense panel including viruses, spores and toxins is desirable and needed for a unified biodefense posture. Tapping into ongoing revolution in next generation sequencing technologies and other nanosensor platforms will provide a sensitive detection platform for biodefense pathogens. There is an untapped, easy to achieve phage potential that has not been fully exploited despite the fact there is renewed interest in phage therapy around the globe.",

Cells transfected with p3 \u00d7 FLAG-CMV-14 followed by staining with mouse anti-TGEV S monoclonal antibody were used as an additional negative control suggests that our selected scFv antibodies may be used as a novel therapeutic reagent to control porcine transmissible gastroenteritis in suckling piglets. Phage display technology dates back 30 years to the discovery that foreign DNA fragments can be fused to the gene encoding the pIII coat protein of a nonlytic filamentous phage and expressed as a fusion protein on the virion surface [36]. A few years later, McCafferty et al. first reported that scFv antibodies can be displayed on the surface of the phage through phage display technology and that scFv antibodies can be obtained after biopanning [37]. This technique for the production of scFv antibodies has several advantages: rapid culture of phage clones, easy handling and detection of secreted antibodies, genetic stability, and lower production costs compared with monoclonal antibodies [38,39]. Lika et al. first attempted to construct a porcine phage library by analyzing sequence data in the IMGT database [40]. These authors reported that information on the kappa and lambda chain repertoire is scant and that some of the kappa/lambda chains might not be recovered from the sites of the transcripts of porcine spleen [40]. The porcine scFv antibody library is incomplete, and further research is required. In this study, we constructed a porcine scFv antibody library against TGEV. The library size was large enough to select specific scFv antibodies despite being smaller than the recommended size (6 \u00d7 10 8 pfu/mL). To our knowledge, this is the first study using a porcine antibody phage library to select scFv antibodies against TGEV.",

They can be efficiently used on biosensor surfaces, i.e., phages with biotinylated capsids can be immobilized on streptavidin-coated surfaces [45]. The fusing of glutathione S transferase (GST) with RBP named Gp48 of Campylobacter phage NCTC 12673 showed increased bacterial detection on SPR biosensor reflected by a low detection limit of 10 2 colony-forming units (CFU/mL) [46]. Genetic modifications of phages can increase the expression of alkaline phosphatase enzymes released while infecting the bacteria, thus increasing the detection sensitivity [47]. The lost activity or function of phage can be restored using genetic engineering [45]. The endorhamnosidase activity of tail spike protein has been reported to be restored using genetic engineering, showing good capture efficiency for Salmonella cells (10 3 CFU/mL) on a gold surface. However, the coated surface did not detect Escherichia coli, which was used as a control pathogen [9]. The specific reporter genes can be inserted into phages whose expression upon infection of a target cell allows the detection of its product [45]. \n\nThe use of phage particles, including tail proteins, tail fibers, and receptor binding proteins (RBPs), in biosensors has immense diagnostic potential as the detection technique is truly highly selective, sensitive, and rapid for detecting bacterial pathogens (Fig. 1) [3]. In 1960, Watson pioneered using phage coat proteins for the detection of bacteria by employing fluorescently labeled antibodies [48]. These phage proteins [5] Nanofibers, and nanoparticles [6] All the substrates are positively charged to allow the phage to bind on its surface through its capsid part. [42] Substrates with positive charges enhance phage attachment [16,53] The chemical functionalization of the substrates increases the phage depositing density [53,14] A single phage-based assay, conjugated with QDs of varying sizes can detect multiple pathogens simultaneously [51].",

            "text": "New urgent requirements for fast, sensitive, accurate, and inexpensive tools for the early diagnosis of PC devalue the traditional PSA detection methods [16], such as ELISA, radioimmunoassay immunoradiometric assay, and time-resolved immunofluorescence assay, which have a complex operation, are difficult to miniaturize, and can have a limited sensitivity [23][24][25][26]. Modern immunoassays and biosensors require a biorecognition probe, which is attached to the interface of the analytical device, bind the target biological ligand, and participate in generating a measurable signal [13,14,27,28], as illustrated in Figure 1. For example, in electrochemical biosensors, the signal can be displayed in impedimetric, amperometric, or potentiometric formats. To complement the p3-type phage display vectors, which were designed to discover therapeutic and diagnostic peptides and antibodies (Figure 2B) [29,30], the p8-type phage technology was developed with the goal creating diagnostic and detection nanoprobes by resurfacing the whole phage particles [31][32][33][34][35][36][37][38][39][40], as illustrated in Figures 2C and 3. In the p8type phage display system, called landscape phage, the dense array of foreign peptides on the body of the phage composes a unique organic landscape.",

            "text": "Sensitive and selective detection of bacterial pathogens is an area of interest due to increasing concerns over food, water, environment and public health safety [1]. Conventional microbiological and serological assay are reliable for pathogen identification and detection but are time consuming, labor intensive and cost ineffective [2]. Some reports suggest that selective and differential plating method may not always give an accurate identification of the bacteria in real life samples [3]. Biosensors have been looked upon as alternative for detecting pathogen, their spores and toxin using different transduction platforms. A biosensor has two key components; a biological probing element (e.g. protein, peptide, deoxyribonucleic acid, ribonucleic acid, whole organism), which imparts specificity of recognition, and a transducer, which converts the recognition event into a measurable signal. Different probing elements and transducer platforms have been integrated to improve the recognition specificity and detection sensitivity of a pathogen biosensor. \n\nMass perturbance [4], electrochemical [1], flow cytometry [5], optical [1,6] and mechanical resonator-based [7,8] sensors have been explored for developing a sensitive pathogen detection platform. Antibodies/peptides [4], DNA [9], RNA [10], aptamers [11], peptide nucleic acid (PNA) [12] and carbohydrate [13] have similarly been used as recognition elements to detect different pathogens. Antibodies particularly have been extensively used as molecular probe for pathogen detection [14]. However, antibodies suffer from temperature and pH instability and are prone to protease degradation [15]. Polyclonal antibodies further suffer from cross-reactivity. Bacteriophages therefore have been looked upon as a robust alternative biological probe for pathogen detection. Phages are bacterial viruses that recognize and bind to specific receptor on the host bacterial surface. Many phages use their tail spike proteins for host recognition and binding [16]. The phage recognition is highly specific and is thus used for bacterial typing. This specificity and selectivity makes intact phages an excellent candidate as probing element in a biosensor.",

            "text": "Due to the method's target specificity and the flexibility of genome editing and chemical modification, phage-based diagnostics offer distinct advantages over other quantitative technologies like ELISA and PCR. This versatility positions them for application in various multidisciplinary contexts. The promising integration of synthetic biology and phage genome engineering offers exciting prospects for reprogramming phage host ranges and functions, as well as isolating functional proteins for synthetic manufacturing and precise control of phage development in detection/diagnostic applications. The field could benefit from automation to minimize human sample handling errors and facilitate point-of-use applications. Combining synthetic biology with automated processes for sample processing, detection and reporting represents a significant advancement in biosensor development. A biosensor with integrated phage detection allows for phage-based strategies to be applied outside laboratory settings, reducing reporting times and enabling real-time tracking of pathogen transmission. This real-time identification can prevent costly procedures like product recall and extensive contamination investigations, potentially saving millions of lives in future. Phage display, with its ability for the rapid isolation of specific ligands, holds numerous advantages across various applications. It is instrumental in selecting inhibitors for both the active and allosteric sites of enzymes, as well as identifying receptor agonists, antagonists, and modulatory peptides for G-protein binding. Additionally, phage display finds utility in epitope mapping and the analysis of protein-protein interactions. Therefore, the ligands isolated from phage libraries will be playing crucial roles in diagnostics and therapeutic target validation, drug design, and vaccine development. Furthermore, phage display will be effectively combined with other methods. With past innovations and ongoing advancements, the future of this field looks very promising.",

            "text": "ovar 4b causing the majority of human epidemics [8,9].\n\nThe current commercially available tests for Listeria spp. are mostly culture techniques which tend to be labour and time intensive. To enhance the detection and identification of L. monocytogenes more rapid methods are urgently needed to meet current demands for food safety testing. A number of rapid methods have been developed, for example immunological techniques such as biosensor [10,11], enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [12] and antibody array [13,14] and, genotypic techniques such as real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) [15][16][17], deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) microarray [18] and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) methods [19,20]. Listeria spp. are closely related both morphologically and biochemically making it difficult to distinguish L. monocytogenes from other Listeria spp. Although genotypic techniques that rely on detecting unique DNA sequences between species are available, such techniques can be time-consuming requiring additional sample extraction steps. Culture combined with immunological techniques are used more routinely, however, generating antibodies with the desired specificity and sensitivity for L. monocytogenes detection presents the challenge of identifying cell surface epitopes which are specific.\n\nSuccessful rapid diagnostic techniques require a specific and high affinitybinder, usually an antibody. Development of animal derived antibodies is not an easy task and they are expensive to produce. In addition efforts are ongoing to reduce, refine and replace the use of animals in scientific research in accordance with EU legislation, Directive 2010/63/EU [21]. Phage display biopanning is a technique extending from the invention of phage display technology in 1985 [22] and offers an alternative means of generating specific affinity ligands. This technique has been used previously in an attempt to generate alternative binders to L. monocytogenes; Paoli et al. [5,23] and Nanduri et al. [24] produced phage display-derived antibody fragments to L. monocytogenes, while Carnazza et al. [25] described the production of phage display",

Scheme illustrating the different recognition elements used for bacterial detection, the several approaches employed for their application, and the various systems that can be combined with these molecules for bacterial detection and identification. PCR stands for polymerase chain reaction, ELISA for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and FISH for fluorescence in situ hybridization.\n\ntheir purification from the host bacteria is sometimes difficult, and require specialized techniques to ensure complete removal of host components [34].\n\nPhages are an extraordinary source of proteins of biotechnological interest, especially the phage-derived bacteria-binding proteins, i.e., the receptor binding proteins (RBPs) and cell-wall binding domains (CBDs) from endolysins ( Figure 2), which have been successfully used in a variety of detection systems [35][36][37][38][39]. In particular, these proteins present: high sensitivity and specificity, small size, high stability to extreme pH and temperature values, resistance to proteases and detergents [40][41][42], ease of recombinant overexpression [43], efficient binding to bacteria living in conditions that commonly cause degradation of other recognition molecules, such as antibodies [42], as well as the ability for detection of bacterial spores [44][45][46]. Moreover, these phage proteins can be tailored or improved to identify different target bacteria. Also, by genetic engineering, desired tags can be added to the phage protein sequence to achieve oriented surface functionalization on biosensing platforms [24,38,[47][48][49][50][51] (Figure 3). Hence, there is interest in exploiting these phage-derived binding proteins as recognition molecules since they present advantages over others (Table 1) and can overcome many of the above-mentioned issues related to the use of the whole phage particles [19,20,[52][53][54].\n\nThis paper provides an overview of the",

            "text": "When a pathogen infects an animal, its epitopes leave an \"imprint\" in the form of a spectrum of disease-specific antibody paratopes in the serum. Most animals are therefore likely to have antibodies directed against a large number of foreign epitopes. The strategy pursued in this study was to use this complex mixture of antibodies to select binders from a limited repertoire of sequences derived from the genome of MmmSC, thereby focussing the phage display selection process on relevant epitopes. These binders were matched to open reading frames present in the genome. Unlike immunoblotting, this approach also identified the genes that coded for the antigenic proteins.\n\nSchematic representation showing alignment of the five selected proteins with phage displayed peptides obtained with CBPP immune sera The entire open reading frames that code for the five proteins (Abc, GapN, GlpO, LppB and PtsG) selected for expression aligned with the phage displayed immunogenic polypeptides that were isolated by panning the fragmented MmmSC genome phage display library against CBPP immune sera. Asterisks indicate peptides isolated more than once and the numbers in parentheses specify the number of repeated isolations for such peptides.\n\nThe fragmented genome library covered approximately 97% of the mycoplasmal genome. While adequate for its purpose, it cannot, however, be considered to have been completely random since among the 1016 proteins encoded in the genome of MmmSC type strain PG1, 797 (78.4%) contain at least one UGA trp codon, which is read as stop codon in E. coli. Moreover, the frequency of UGA trp codons in coding sequences of MmmSC genes is relatively high: 1.00% in contrast to 0.05% of UGG trp codons. This means that epitopes containing such stops could be disrupted. Moreover, in a phage display system, the secreted phages would be unlikely to display large oligopeptides or those that resisted being transported through the bacterial membrane or periplasm. The functionality of the library was therefore first tested by selecting peptides with a polyclonal rabbit antiserum directed against a single recombinant MmmSC polypeptide, i.e., the C-terminal pro",

            "text": "This requires stable peptide-MHC-I binding and has resulted in the production of TCRm against tumor and viral T-cell epitopes. While the traditional strategy for making TCRm antibodies is hybridoma technology, in the mid 1990s, it was shown that phage display technology could also be used to isolate antibodies (87). In this method, libraries of phage particles are generated, where each phage displays a unique antibody (a scFv or a Fab fragment) as a fusion protein on their surface. Each phage particle has the genes that encode the particular antibody that is expressed on its cell surface. Therefore, it is possible to select different phage particles by assessing whether they bind a target and thereby isolate the antibodies that have the desired specificity. The bound phages are then eluted and amplified in bacteria. Phage display technology has been used to isolate various TCRm antibodies against cancer antigens (63,69,92,93). \n\nMost TCRm antibodies published thus far have used phage display libraries for antibody production. Investigators argue that the main advantage of phage display is that it is efficient while being a relatively fast method (53). On the other hand, hybridoma technology is a relatively slower strategy, and it requires the immunogenic peptide and the MHC complex to bind with high affinity and form a very stable complex in order for the complex to persist throughout the immunization and in vivo IgG maturation. Nevertheless, the advantages of hybridoma technology include the isolation of antibodies that have a high affinity (in the low nanomolar range) for the peptide-MHC complex. This is due to the fact that antibodies undergo multiple antigen challenges and affinity maturation in vivo. Whereas affinities of TCRm antibodies produced through phage display tend to lie in the moderate nanomolar range (\u224850-300 nM) and many require further in vitro affinity maturation (94,95). \n\nFurthermore, the antibodies produced through hybridoma technology are bivalent IgG isotype antibodies, whereas antibodies isolated using phage display are either scFv or Fab fragments (i.e. in the monovalent form with no Fc region). The Fc portion of the antibody is crucial in recruiting components of the immune system for cytotoxic effects mediated through ADCC and CDC.",

One phagotope recognizing an epitope within the 2F5 and 4E10 BNtAbs epitopes on gp41 (AB#31) with affinities in the nanomolar range was isolated. Importantly, it was shown to compete with 41 out of 42 gp160-reactive plasma samples from North-American and African HIV-1 positive patients, indicating that this antibody recognizes an epitope conserved in a large panel of isolates and might be suitable for diagnostic applications.\n\nSince all vaccine candidates elicited antibodies reacting positively in HIV tests, Khurana et al. applied the phage display technology to identify HIV-1 epitopes susceptible to help discriminate between successfully immunized vaccinees and seroconverters [177]. They constructed a phage library displaying the full HIV-1 genome and screened it against the sera of newly seroconverted HIV-1 positive individuals. They identified conserved epitopes present in gp41 and in Gag p6 that were not part of the vaccine used at that moment and established a new detection test, named SELECTEST, that demonstrated over 99% selectivity and sensitivity for the early detection of seroconversion. HIV SELECTEST was able to detect antibodies against these epitopes in newly infected patients as early as 2 to 4 weeks after infection.",

            "text": "It has also been reported that using phage display high specificity antibodies can be isolated from immunised sources which would be missed by traditional immunological methods [100]. A key feature of this system is the linkage of genotype (phagemid vector) and phenotype (phage coat protein-antibody fragment) which allows immediate access to the corresponding gene sequences of selected antibodies facilitating simple sub-cloning into various antibody formats based on required downstream applications (Fig. 6.1). Over the last 20 years phage display technologies have been successfully used for the development of many therapeutic antibody candidates and approved drugs and with the relaxation of commercial restrictions more and more products are now entering the diagnostic and research markets as well [9]. \n\nThe drawbacks of animal immunisation for the construction of phage display libraries include the time period required for the completion of such a process and the requirement to construct separate libraries for each antigen. However, by combining the power of immunisation with phage display, several high affinity monoclonal antibodies against \"difficult\" antigenic targets have been isolated from relative small antibody libraries and where traditional approaches have failed [33,98]. Generating antibodies against self or toxic antigens is limited if immunisation is to be employed. In particular, human autoantigens are highly conserved amongst most routinely used laboratory mammals such as mice or rat. Therefore immunisation of non-mammals such as sharks and chickens, which are phylogenetically distant from humans, has been successfully employed for generating an immune response and antibodies and/or antibody like binders (VNAR) to epitopes conserved in mammalian species [42]. Chickens are phylogenetically distant from humans and therefore very successful in generating an immune response to mammalian proteins which are highly conserved [34], while sharks are even more distant from humans, diverging from a common ancestor approximately 450 million years ago [6,37,53].",

            "text": "The MAb was developed by the Phage Display, using a library licensed by Human Genome Sciences (HGS), which now is GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), from Cambridge Antibody Technology. Recombinant PA was used in the biopanning process to select candidates, which were then screened in assays for PA neutralization [60,61]. \n\nThe Phage Display technology provides a rapid methodology for building a highaffinity antibody library from immune repertoires. These antibodies can be used to generate diagnostic bases or be tested for therapeutic capability. For example, from the repertoire of B cells of patients who recovered from influenza virus infections or who received vaccination, it was possible to isolate, by Phage Display, several antibodies with the neutralization property of different influenza virus subtypes. Another example of antibody-based immunotherapy developed by Phage Display involves the identification of antibodies specific to different types of coronavirus. These studies are an example of how Phage Display enables the selection of antibodies by an in vitro process, especially for new or mutated pathogens in an outbreak of emergent infectious diseases, as it uses only pathogen-specific antigens [39,62,63]. \n\nParticularly, MAbs play an important role in antiviral immunity preventing viral replication and disease progress. Antibodies can interfere with virus infection by various mechanisms. The primary mechanism is by targeting the virus surface proteins; antibodies can inhibit virus attachment to cell surface receptors. Another main mechanism is targeting non-receptor-binding regions, such as in endosomal membrane fusion step where neutralization can occur by interfering virus conformational changes. In general, flavivirus particles tend to display on their surface continuum epitopes that induce potently neutralizing antibodies, blocking viral entry into cells [58]. \n\nFrom the understanding of the structure of each flavivirus, it was possible to determine the antibody targets most conducive to the diagnosis and protection of the disease [64]. It is important to note that flaviviruses are not static particles and viral proteins are in a constant dynamic movement, a process known as breathing, in order to transiently reveal new epitopes, and this characteristic influences the detection and neutralization capabilities of antibodies [10].",

Ideally, these antibodies recognize the pathogen with high specificity and high affinity and preserve their effectiveness against pathogen variants, targeting different epitopes of an antigen indispensable to the pathogen survival. Developing antibodies with these characteristics is possible using in vitro selection of human antibody libraries derived from healthy donors, by display technologies. Importantly, these antibody libraries can be rapidly accessed at the onset of a pandemic (infected blood is not needed), or even before the onset of a pandemic (if pathogens with the potential to cause a pandemic can be predicted). The na\u00efve scFv library used in our selections [35] was constructed from total RNA in human peripheral blood lymphocytes, using degenerate oligonucleotides (although even using domain specific 5' and 3' primers, sufficient similarity to support amplification of off target V domain regions can be achieved [70]). Diversity was further enhanced by VL and VH recombination mediated by crerecombinase. Deep sequencing result estimated the total diversity of this library to exceed 10 11 unique clones. As noted by Moon et al. [71] such large na\u00efve libraries can yield antibodies against virtually any antigen. We attribute our success in selecting an excellent pool of antibodies to the diversity of our library, in combination with carefully orchestrated selection protocols. Furthermore, in vitro selections offer a more accessible and less expensive alternative to natural evolution in humanized mice or human B cell isolation pipelines. In vitro selection also allows for the isolation of highly pathogen-specific antibodies, especially when the library is depleted of antibodies interacting with close relatives of the target antigen. Additionally, the use of complementary display platforms such as phage and yeast (like in this and previous work [54,61]) allows to select antibodies that are more likely to retain immunoreactivity outside the display context, tend to be better folded and more stable, and thus can be rapidly developed into commercial products. Importantly, selection by yeast display (where up to 10 5 scFv copies can be surface exposed [72]) allows isolation of low affinity antibodies that would probably be lost if only phage display was used.",

            "text": "We have reviewed the genome and proteins of the coliphage Q\u03b2 and proposed ways to improve its potential to display peptides, antibodies, nanobodies, and different library formats through genetic engineering. In contrast to the traditional display with DNA phages, this new system has multiple advantages ranging from the rRNA construction, phages production, to biopanning for variants selection. This has broad application in virology especially through displaying epitopes (mimotopes) of challenging RNA viruses which would help in the development of both vaccines and optimize novel biomarkers for point of care kits or theragnosis. In cancer biology, random library display can lead to the selection of major immune checkpoint inhibitors for therapeutic purposes. Generalized library screens can aid in developing peptides as new drugs from library selection and evolution. The introduction of new biomolecules resulting from mixtures of selected peptides from novel libraries and appropriate nanoparticles becomes feasible. Similarly, construction of novel biosensors by evolving peptides to detect molecules and life-threatening agents can be developed as well (See Figure 2 attached) in the environment. The uniqueness of the RNA coliphage Q\u03b2 display system comes from its inherent structure, biology, and its potential broad application in live sciences. (here antibody-antigen) complex, the detection is 100% measurable (transducer saturated with detector) and the opposite (antibodies compete and hide the transducer) will be subtracted to quantify the target detected by the biosensor.",

            "text": "Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have long been used for biological and medical research, as well as in vitro diagnostics. However, the derivation of mAbs is relatively expensive and time consuming. Over the past decade, an alternative and effective way to obtain monoclonal antibodies has been the use of recombinant antibody display libraries from which antibodies of interest can be selected and expressed in E. coli [1]. Filamentous phage display [2] is the most widely distributed display platform, with yeast [3] and ribosome display [4] also frequently used. The commonest antibody formats used are single chain Fvs (scFvs) [5] and Fabs. scFvs are recombinant constructs in which the variable domains of the heavy and light chains are covalently linked together by a flexible linker [5], whereas Fabs were originally described by the digestion of antibody with papain [6], and consist of two protein fragments, VH-CH1, and VL-CL that can be expressed separately in the E. coli periplasm where they assemble together [7]. Fulllength antibodies include the Fc region, which, from a reagent point of view, can be considered to be a large tag recognized by secondary antibodies or bacterial superantigens, such as protein A or G. Antibody fragments, in contrast, are usually modified by the fusion of in-frame tags to the antibody fragment. The commonest format includes a short peptide tag (e.g. myc [8] or SV5 [9]) recognized by a monoclonal antibody, and a histidine tag that can be used for purification by immobilized metal affinity chromatography [10]. Detection of antibody fragments using peptide tags generally requires an extra step when compared to the detection of full-length antibodies, since anti-peptide and subsequent labeled secondary antibodies are usually required. Given the recombinant nature of antibody fragments selected from phage display libraries, it was initially thought it would be relatively trivial to fuse effector domains directly to antibody fragments.",

            "text": "The importance of phage display platforms was recognized with the awarding of the Nobel Prize to George P. Smith and Sir Gregory P. Winter for the 'phage display of peptides and antibodies' in 2018. Phage display libraries are widely used to identify novel antigen-specific monoclonal antibodies and map the binding sites or epitopes of proteins or antibodies. Phage display technology has also emerged as a robust platform for drug discovery in biotechnology due to its ability to facilitate the efficient identification of antibodies in vitro (Nagano and Tsutsumi, 2021). This technology facilitates extensive applications in biomedical research, drug development, and bioengineering (Kim et al., 2011). \n\nOne key advancement that has greatly improved the efficiency and scalability of phage display technology is Oligonucleotide Library Synthesis (OLS). OLS allows for the high-throughput synthesis of numerous oligonucleotide sequences, which can then be used to create highly diverse peptide libraries. Phage Immunoprecipitation Sequencing (PhIP-Seq) is a technique derived from traditional phage display that utilizes OLS to encode peptide libraries. PhIP-Seq enables the efficient detection of antibodies on a large scale by employing a high-capacity phage display peptide library, antibody immunoprecipitation, and highthroughput sequencing (Mohan et al., 2018). This technique can detect antibodies against hundreds of thousands of peptides and provide a comprehensive mapping of antibody profiles, making it particularly advantageous in studying complex diseases or immune responses to large pathogen families. Moreover, its high multiplexing capability allows for the analysis of multiple samples simultaneously, significantly reducing the cost of DNA sequencing per sample and enabling the analysis of large sets of samples. With these aforementioned characteristics, PhIP-Seq facilitates the discovery of novel antibodies and enhances our understanding of the immune response. \n\nAs shown in Figure 1, In this review, we highlight the research progress of PhIP-Seq technology, encompassing the entire process from the library's design to the data analysis. We have also summarized current challenges and potential solutions for them. Furthermore, we explore prospective directions for future development in PhIP-Seq technology and its applications.",

            "text": "Combinatorial antibody phage display technologies provide robust means for the rapid discovery of tumor antigen antibodies [13]. It is easy to implement and inexpensive. Numerous academic and industrial laboratories have adopted the technique and contributed to its advancement. The methods for design, construction and screening of synthetic antibody libraries are constantly being improved and semi-automated selection strategies have been proposed. The advantage of antibody phage display is the direct isolation of fully human antibodies in comparison to antibodies generated by mouse hybridoma technology where a laborious humanization procedure of the lead candidates is required. Many products of phage display are now reaching the Biopharmaceutical market. Monoclonal antibodies had been the standard as anticancer agents by modulating intrinsic tumor cell pathways and activating the innate immune response against cancer cells. Phage display derived human antibodies obviously can compete with earlier generation products as long as they are directed to well defined targets such as the EGFR or VEGF pathway. Phage display plays an important role in drug discovery and development with a number of molecules approved by FDA and many others in clinical trials. It is normal to expect that greater improvement will be made in the near future and phage display will bring many more contributions to oncology.",

            "text": "Monoclonal antibodies, including scFv antibody that recognizes a single antigenic epitope, have more potential in application to diagnostic and therapeutic agents. In contrast to traditional hybridoma technology needs isolation of B cells from the spleen, fusion of myeloma and B cells, separation of cell lines and screening of suitable cell lines, Huse et al. broke through the stereotypes and opened up new prospects for the generation of monoclonal antibody and the development of targeted therapies by constructing antibody libraries to select using phage display technology [38]. We constructed two libraries and selected scFv antibodies against EV71-infected cell lysate (Figures 2 and 3). The short linker and long linker were used following the protocols previously described [26]. Additional linkers were also applied by other research groups. In our experiences, specific scFv antibodies with either the short linker or long linker could be selected through bio-panning [29]. The libraries constructed from hyper-immunized animals offered a more effective and feasible way to select specific antibodies compared to na\u00efve libraries which needed more rounds of bio-panning to obtain specific clones [39]. In addition, it reduced the size of the library required to produce highly specific antibodies by using hyper-immunized animals as the source of immunoglobulin cDNA [40]. Otherwise, the integral procedure required for identifying specific antibodies was 1-2 months using phage display system, which is much quicker than traditional hybridoma technology requiring 3-5 months [41]. Taken together, considering both the expenditure and time, the phage display system is further confirmed to be superior to traditional hybridoma technology for generating specific antibodies [42,43]. However, the promiscuous pairing of V L and V H genes occurred in E. coli host may be disputable [42]. This problem could be answered by carrying out further experiments. Nevertheless, since the main purpose of our study was to obtain protein molecule(s) with binding activity, it may be more appropriate to name these E. coli-derived scFv molecules as \"antibody-like molecules\" or \"recombinant binding proteins\" to avoid such confusion.",

            "text": "For instance, Abicipar pegol, an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibody fragment, has been approved for the treatment of neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration. Belimumab (Benlysta), targeting the soluble B lymphocyte stimulator, which is involved in the survival and activation of B cells, is employed to reduce disease activity in systemic lupus erythematosus patients [37]. \n\nThe process of constructing these engineered antibodies follows a similar procedure. Initially, a phage library is generated by cloning a diverse array of antibody variable region sequences into a phage display vector. This library encompasses a broad spectrum of antibody fragments, each showcased on the surface of individual phage particles. Through multiple rounds of biopanning, phages displaying antibodies that specifically bind to the target antigen are selected from the library. These chosen phages are subsequently amplified and propagated to enrich for high-affinity binders. Finally, the DNA sequences encoding the variable regions of the selected antibodies are isolated and inserted into expression vectors for the production of full-length antibodies. Atezolizumab, for instance, was discovered through screening a human phage display library against a recombinant extracellular domain-Fc fusion of human PD-L1. From this screening, a high-affinity antibody was isolated from a single phage clone, utilizing a human IgG1 backbone. Due to PD-L1 expression on activated T cells, the Fc region of atezolizumab underwent engineering to abolish the antibody-dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC) effect. This engineering involved introducing an Asn to Ala substitution at position 298 within the CH2 domain of each heavy chain. As a result, atezolizumab was rendered incapable of binding to human Fc\u03b3 receptors. \n\nComparing the use of a phage-derived monoclonal antibody (mAb) to the original mAb in cancer treatment reveals several advantages of phage display-derived antibodies. Firstly, phage display allows for the generation of antibodies with enhanced specificity and affinity through iterative rounds of selection and optimization. This enables the identification of antibodies with superior binding properties compared to those obtained through traditional hybridoma-based methods [36].",

            "text": "The immune libraries are obtained from immunized animals or humans and are mostly used to discover antibodies against infectious pathogens (Trott et al., 2014) or antigenic targets in cancer patients (Thie et al., 2011;Frenzel et al., 2016). This library contains a restricted antibody repertoire that underwent antigen-driven in vivo selection (Barbas et al., 1991;Orum et al., 1993;Frenzel et al., 2016), which differs from the other phage display libraries, known as \"universal\", that theoretically provide binders for all possible antigen structures (Frenzel et al., 2016). The na\u00efve antibody libraries are generated from a pool of B lymphocytes of non-immunized donors, and one successful example is the scFv library licensed from Cambridge Antibody Technology (CAT; now part of MedImmune/AstraZeneca) (Javle et al., 2014;Almagro et al., 2019). While the na\u00efve libraries are derived from natural antibody gene repertoires, the synthetic ones are entirely based on in silico design to obtain individual antibody amino acid sequences (Fuh, 2007), bypassing the need to isolate antibody genes. The semisynthetic libraries, on the other hand, are created using both naturally and synthetically (in silico) randomized CDRs. In this library type, it is possible to redesign natural CDRs to improve the chance of finding antibodies with high specificity and affinity (Orum et al., 1993;Fuh, 2007). \n\nBuilding the phage display library is the most important step of this technology. There is a directly proportional relationship between the size of the antibody library and the probability of finding a particular antibody (Burioni et al., 1997;Almagro et al., 2019). The Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) is an important tool to analyze the variability, the sequence composition, and the size of antibody phage display libraries (Rouet et al., 2018). The construction of a phage display library is more expensive than generating hybridomas after animal immunization. However, the antibody screening step of the phage display method is faster and cheaper (Hentrich et al., 2018).",

            "text": "Background At present, screening of the population at risk for gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) is based on detection of antibodies against native variant surface glycoproteins (VSGs) of Trypanosoma brucei (T.b.) gambiense. Drawbacks of these native VSGs include culture of infective T.b. gambiense trypanosomes in laboratory rodents, necessary for production, and the exposure of non-specific epitopes that may cause cross-reactions. We therefore aimed at identifying peptides that mimic epitopes, hence called \u201cmimotopes,\u201d specific to T.b. gambiense VSGs and that may replace the native proteins in antibody detection tests. Methodology/Principal Findings A Ph.D.-12 peptide phage display library was screened with polyclonal antibodies from patient sera, previously affinity purified on VSG LiTat 1.3 or LiTat 1.5. The peptide sequences were derived from the DNA sequence of the selected phages and synthesised as biotinylated peptides. Respectively, eighteen and twenty different mimotopes were identified for VSG LiTat 1.3 and LiTat 1.5, of which six and five were retained for assessment of their diagnostic performance. Based on alignment of the peptide sequences on the original protein sequence of VSG LiTat 1.3 and 1.5, three additional peptides were synthesised. We evaluated the diagnostic performance of the synthetic peptides in indirect ELISA with 102 sera from HAT patients and 102 endemic negative controls. All mimotopes had areas under the curve (AUCs) of \u22650.85, indicating their diagnostic potential. One peptide corresponding to the VSG LiTat 1.3 protein sequence also had an AUC of \u22650.85, while the peptide based on the sequence of VSG LiTat 1.5 had an AUC of only 0.79. Conclusions/Significance We delivered the proof of principle that mimotopes for T.b. gambiense VSGs, with diagnostic potential, can be selected by phage display using polyclonal human antibodies.",

            "text": "Manon Nuytten from UCLouvain then discussed the use of phages as a diagnostic tool, here for the development of Lateral Flow Assays (LFAs) based on phage proteins. LFAs, widely employed in point-of-care testing (e.g., COVID-19 self-test), are crucial in various fields but face limitations with traditional antibodies, such as variability in specificity and stability, and high costs. Phage proteins, involved in processes like adsorption and lysis, can serve as alternative bioreceptors for LFAs, but the understanding of their interface interactions is lacking. The emergence of precise bioinformatics tools such as AlphaFold2 has significantly facilitated the microstructural characterization and engineering of phage proteins, ultimately improving the performance of phage-based biosensors. In her talk, Manon Nuytten focused on the Bacillus cereus group which includes pathogenic species, emphasizing the importance of their rapid detection in the agro-food sector to prevent food poisoning. Through in silico analysis of phage affinity proteins targeting B. cereus used in an LFA format, the study identified regions involved both in the binding to LFA interfaces and bacterial cells, contributing to the optimization of protein performance in these tests. \n\nThe final presentation of the conference was delivered by Johan Quintens from V\u00e9sale Biosciences, a Belgian biotech established in 2018, focusing on personalized phage-based therapies. He outlined the four key pillars that underpin their efforts to offer successful phage therapy in the near future. The first pillar involves the development of a phagogram (Luminophage \u00ae ) to determine the targeted bacteria's sensitivity to a collection of phages, facilitating the selection of the most suitable phage. The second key point emphasized by Johan Quintens is the importance of maintaining a library of active phages against pathogens present in Western European hospitals, particularly targeting multidrug-resistant strains of E. coli, S. aureus, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa. To achieve this, various networks of European and international partners have been established to ensure a comprehensive collection of phages and multidrug-resistant bacterial strains.",

By conjugating it with horseradish peroxidase, they established an enzyme-linked LTF assay that achieved a sensitivity limit of detection (LOD) of 10 2 CFU\u2022mL \u22121 . Similarly, Filik et al. exploited the tail fiber protein (TFP) of phage \u03d5YeO3-12 to detect Yersinia enterocolitica, which has a long incubation period (up to 10 days) [200]. They successfully engineered a maltose-binding protein-tagged TFP and employed an ELISA-based method, which yielded an LOD of 10 5 CFU. \n\nSimilarly, available studies have highlighted that the sensitivity and specificity of phage-based methods exceed those of traditional approaches such as antibody-based diagnosis. Moreover, the cost and time advantages of phage industrialization are similar to those of eukaryotic cell-based antibody production. Exploring the potential of utilizing the complete phage structure as a detection tool augmented through phage genome engineering presents a promising route for maximizing innate host specificity.",

            "text": "The second protocol is employed to identify the most promising hits or binders of interest within this pool, usually through a phage ELISA or an inhibition assay. \n\nIn addition to the steps outlined in the biopanning process, it is essential to highlight the importance of performing a subtractive selection using antibodies from negative samples. This critical step aims to eliminate non-specific binders in the library and clones that may bind to the constant part of the antibodies. To mitigate any potential interference during the panning process, it is recommended to add these antibodies to the phage library. One approach to achieving this is by incubating the serum sample on a surface coated with helper phages (e.g., for phagemid M13) or the original phage without an insert (e.g., for T7 phage) This effectively removes phage-specific antibodies before further utilization. \n\nAfter obtaining the selected hits, it is important to optimize them if needed, possibly through techniques like site-directed mutagenesis. Subsequently, a thorough characterization of the hits is necessary to assess their antibody binding capability, their potential to elicit an immune response, and the effectiveness of that immune response. \n\nThe epitopes of a pathogen identified through phage display have diverse applications, including the development of diagnostic tests, understanding pathogen-host interactions, and the creation of therapeutics such as monoclonal antibodies, small molecule inhibitors, and vaccines. \n\nMoreover, numerous studies have employed phage display techniques in the context of infectious diseases, using two key components: a phage display library and antibodies from samples taken from infected, convalescent, or vaccinated individuals. For instance, in the case of hepatitis A virus (HAV), mimotopes were identified using antibodies from hepatitis A patients. One of the identified phages exhibited the ability to hinder the attachment of anti-HAV antibodies, eliciting a specific immune response in mice. Similarly, phage display libraries were utilized to discover mimotopes of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen (HBsAg), leading to the generation of highly specific antibodies in vaccinated mice. Furthermore, mimotopes of the human hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein were identified using serum from an HCV-infected patient.",

Such markers are either peptide ligands that mimic epitope regions (mimotope) or monoclonal antibody fragments (Fab or scFv) against specific targets selected through cycles of biopanning (binding-washing-elutiontransformation-amplification), also called Phage Display. The fundamental advantage of this technology is the direct link between the experimental phenotype and its encapsulated genotype, which allows the evolution of selected binders into optimized molecules [1,2]. Peptide ligands may be used to map immunologically active sites in proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and also as individual epitope-mimicking antigens and immunogens [3,4]. The selected mimotopes may also be directly used in phage-based ELISA immunoassays, resulting in simple, specific, sensitive, and low-cost immunodiagnostic tests [5]. Similarly, the selection of antibodies from combinatorial libraries has also become an important tool for the generation of reagents, diagnostics, and therapeutic molecules. It is the only method to obtain specific antibodies bypassing the immunization step, which mimics the maturation process of human antibody in vivo, resulting in high affinity antibody ligands, which may be suitable to human administration and potentially applicable to clinical diagnosis and treatment. We have generated successful molecules for diagnostic [5][6][7][8] and therapeutic [7,9] purposes through phage display by in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo approaches of selection.",

To overcome these challenges, phage display has emerged as a valuable tool for identifying specific epitopes that could be used in vaccines. This review emphasizes the direct connection between epitope identification and vaccine development, filling a crucial gap in the field. This technique allows vaccines to be engineered to effectively stimulate the immune system by presenting carefully selected epitopes. Phage display involves screening libraries of random peptides or gene/genome fragments using serum samples from infected, convalescent, or vaccinated individuals. This method has been used to identify epitopes from various pathogens including SARS-CoV-2, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, hepatitis viruses, H5N1, HIV-1, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1, Plasmodium falciparum, Trypanosoma cruzi, and Dirofilaria repens. Bacteriophages offer advantages such as being immunogenic carriers, low production costs, and customization options, making them a promising alternative to traditional vaccines. The purpose of this study has been to highlight an approach that encompasses the entire process from epitope identification to vaccine production using a single technique, without requiring additional manipulation. Unlike conventional methods, phage display demonstrates exceptional efficiency and speed, which could provide significant advantages in critical scenarios such as pandemics.",

            "text": "Phages are viruses that use their host bacterial cells as factories for their own replication and have the ability to display peptides or proteins on their surfaces. This technology is called phage display. Phage display can be used as a powerful tool to screen for affinity reagents for all kind of targets, ranging from small molecules to proteins and even cells. This selection can be performed by using phage libraries consisting of a high number of different phages (10 8 -10 10 ), each displaying a different peptide or protein on its surface. Among the huge number of phages in these phage libraries, the ones with high affinity and specificity for a target can be isolated in an affinity selection procedure (Fig. 1). Moreover, the proteins and peptides displayed on these selected phages can be identified by sequencing the gene coding for the displayed protein or peptide. This coding gene can be found in the singlestranded DNA (ssDNA) inside the selected phage. The target specific phages can be used as affinity reagents in diagnostic tests. Besides the target specific phages, the soluble peptides or proteins, released from the phage coat, can also be used as affinity reagents. These peptides or proteins are then produced synthetically or by recombinant expression in bacterial cells. Different types of phage libraries exist, displaying different types of peptides or proteins: peptides, cellular proteins (from cDNA libraries) or antibody fragments, like single chain variable fragments (scFv) and antigen binding fragment (Fab). Antibody fragment phage libraries are used commonly in immunology (Hoogenboom et al. 1998). Their wide diversity enables them to imitate the natural immune system. Phage display enables the production of sizeable amounts of the affinity reagents, avoiding the batch to batch variations which occur with classical antibodies. Moreover, there is no immune response required to produce affinity reagents for a target, making the selection of affinity reagents for poorly immunogenic targets possible. Peptide phage libraries can also be used to select affinity reagents, since the binding site, or epitope, only involves a few amino acids. Besides the monovalent phages that display one peptide on the phage surface, so-called landscape phages are also used as affinity reagents",

            "text": "The direct detection of Ag85 in patient serum has been proposed as an effective diagnostic for TB [14,15]. This requires stable specific high affinity antibodies, which to date have been either polyclonal [15,31] or monoclonal [14,15,32], obtained by immunization. More recently, methods to generate antibodies using in vitro methods, such as phage and yeast display, have been developed. These have significant advantages over traditional immunization, including the speed with which antibodies can be selected and the ability to screen many more clones for highly specific properties. More significantly, once selected, it is relatively straightforward to improve many antibody properties such as: a) affinity [33,34]; b) specificity, [35,36]; and c) expression levels [37,38]. In this paper, we have combined the two most powerful in vitro antibody selection platforms (phage and yeast display) to select a large number of antibodies against Ag85. This panel comprises a far greater antibody variety than usually obtained when carrying out phage display alone, significantly increasing the number of available anti-Ag85 antibodies. We believe this is due to the more efficient harvesting of the available antibody diversity. Depending upon the efforts expended in creating them, na\u0131 \u00a8ve antibody libraries have enormous diversity (.10 9 different clones) [20,22,39,40]. Theoretical [41] and practical [42,43] studies have shown that, depending upon the desired affinity, a library size of ,10 7 clones should yield approximately one specific antibody, and that the number of selected antibodies should increase proportionally with library size. However, this has not been the case with phage display, where, unless especially heroic efforts are made [44], only 5-30 different specific antibodies are usually selected from large libraries. This is likely due to additional biases occurring during phage display selection [45] that do not appear to occur in yeast display [20], probably because expression control is tighter. \n\nThis combination of technologies exploits the advantages of each of the two platforms. After carrying out one to two rounds of selection in phage, the diversity is reduced from 10 9-11 to 10 5-6 .",

Worldwide, the common cause of mortality and morbidity is bacterial infection often due to misdiagnosis or delay in diagnosis. Existing bacterial detection methods rely on conventional culture or microscopic techniques and molecular methods that often time consuming, laborious and expensive, or need trained users. In recent years, biosensor remained an interesting topic for bacterial detection and many biosensors involving different bio-probes have been reported. Compared to antibodies, nucleic acids and enzymes etc., based biosensors, bacteriophages can be cheaply produced and are relatively much stable to elevated temperature, extreme pH, and diverse ionic strength. Therefore, there is an urgent need for phage-based biosensor for bacterial pathogen detection. Furthermore, bearing high affinity and specificity, bacteriophages are perfect bio-recognition probes in biosensor development for bacterial detection. In this regard, active and oriented phages immobilization is the key step toward phage-based biosensor development. This chapter compares different bacterial detection techniques, and introduces the basic of biosensor and different bio-probes involved in biosensor development. Further we highlight the involvement and importance of phages in biosensor and finally we briefed different phage immobilization approaches used in development of phage-based biosensors.",

            "text": "Display technologies, such as phage, yeast and ribosome display are important tools in the identification of therapeutic antibodies. 1 In particular, phage display is widely used at several stages of the drug discovery process. Phage library diversity can be derived from na\u00efve human B cells, 2 synthetic engineered antibody sequences 3 or from B cell-rich tissue of immunized animals; 4 libraries generated by the latter method are often referred to as immune phage display libraries. Immune phage display offers several advantages over na\u00efve or synthetic display approaches, increasing the likelihood of isolating stable, high-affinity specific antibodies due to pre-enrichment and in-vivo affinity maturation. 5 Traditional isolation of antibodies from phage display libraries involves multiple rounds of panning followed by screening and sequencing of positive clones. A key limitation when identifying clones is the screening step following enrichment. Selecting clones can be technically challenging and time consuming, and the process is often hampered by dominant clones within the enriched population, which makes it difficult to identify alternative binders with lower representation within the pool.\n\nDespite recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, sequence read length is a limitation in their application to phage display screening. The majority of NGS platform technologies allow a maximum read length of up to 500 base pair (bp), 6 which has extensively been used for the analysis of immunoglobulin (Ig)-repertoires in several species. This length, however, is not sufficient to cover a full singlechain variable fragment (scFv) sequences. 7,8 Currently, sequencing of the entire variable heavy (VH) and variable light (VL) fragment of a single chain is not routinely carried out and is not possible using conventional NGS platforms. Single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing allows the contiguous sequencing of fragments of up to 8500 bp, 9 but read length comes at the expense of sequence fidelity. 10 A recent advance in SMRT sequencing is the addition of hairpin loops to double-stranded DNA fragments. 11 Consensus sequencing of adaptor ligated fragments can increase the sequence accuracy of an 850 bp fragment (the approximate length of an average scFv) to 99.99%. 12 Hemadou et al. first demonstrated this approach to be effective at accurately identifying full-length scFvs in an enriched fully human,",

            "text": "In a world plagued by emerging pathogenic threats, there remains a great need for targeting strategies that enable accurate and sensitive diagnostics and effective therapeutics. Human monoclonal antibodies, like the ones presented herein, offer the opportunity for accurate and sensitive immunodiagnostics and/or potent imnunoantibiotics. Ideally, these antibodies have no adverse effects on human microbiota/tissue while binding their pathogenderived antigens with high specificity and high affinity. \n\nImmunoantibiotics might provide unique resilience to pathogen mutations, as they can be deployed as an oligoclonal mixture, ie, targeting different epitopes of the same antigen. Developing antibodies with these characteristics is possible using in vitro evolution of human-antibody libraries by various display technologies. This approach allows for the selection of pathogen-specific antibodies, especially when negative selection steps are included to deplete the library of antibodies interacting with human cells and/or other microorganisms. Furthermore, the use of complementary display platforms (eg, phage and yeast, as previously described 54,61 ) allows selection of reagents that tend to be relatively well expressed in comparison to traditional selection methods. This results in high-specificity human antibodies that are more likely to retain immunoreactivity outside the display context and thus rapidly developable into commercial products. Affinity of these antibodies can eventually be increased by in vitro affinity maturation, should the need arise. \n\nHere, we carefully characterized a set of previously reported antibodies obtained by in vitro selection of a phage-display library of single-chain human antibodies for binding to recombinant Y. pestis virulence factor F1. 58 Among these antibodies, we downselected \u03b1F1Ig 2 and \u03b1F1Ig 8, based on features required for development of accurate, sensitive, and portable diagnostics, and targeted therapeutics. We further derivatized \u03b1F1Ig 2 and \u03b1F1Ig 8 to bind radiometals for alternative antibiotic applications. Their retention of immunoreactivity as phage- 58 and yeast-displayed scFvs (Supplementary Figure S1), indicates that the functionality of \u03b1F1Ig 2 and \u03b1F1Ig 8 is unaffected by display context.",

            "text": "C and 3D. The production of these fragments is dependent on the vector selected for harbouring the library [38].\n\nBiopanning is used for the selection of binders from an antibody library which may contain between 10 7 and 10 10 different antibody-encoding gene sequences. To achieve this, the antigen is immobilised on solid phase (e.g. on a column or immunotube) or bead-conjugated (in solution phase) and the antibody pool is subjected to recurrent rounds of selection against the antigen with increasing levels of stringency in terms of binding ability. Selected binders are retained and subjected to additional screening to increase their specificity for the target (affinity maturation), which can be monitored by ELISA-based analysis. The production of soluble antibody fragments can be facilitated by infecting phage pools into non-suppressor E. coli strains, such as Top-10F' or HB2151, and inducing with isopropyl-\u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) in the presence of low concentrations of glucose. These hosts recognise the amber (AUG) codon engineered between the scFv and gIII gene [39], producing scFv or Fab fragments independent of the phage coat proteins.\n\nThe majority of the examples given in this review involving immunosensor-based pathogen detection incorporate monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies. However, recombinant antibodies are as yet not fully exploited in this field and have several significant advantages over conventional antibodies. The specificity and sensitivity of recombinant antibodies for a particular antigen can be significantly enhanced by the targeting of CDR regions using site-directed mutagenesis or chain shuffling [40,41]. Further advantages include the capacity to incorporate tags (e.g. His or C-myc) for isolation and, subsequently, immobilisation, the ability to fuse various labels (e.g. green fluorescent protein or enzymes) directly to the antibody fragment facilitating and simplifying detection, and the availability of a range of antibody formats (e.g. scFv, Fab, re-engineered IgG, dimers etc.). Avian hosts, in particular, have been shown to be useful for the production of",

            "text": "Rabbits are a prominent and well-established choice for generating both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies, owing to their unique characteristics. They are known for their ability to produce large quantities of high-affinity antibodies, often exhibiting picomolar equilibrium dissociation constants [20]. Furthermore, in contrast to rodents that are evolutionarily closer to humans, rabbit-derived antibodies possess the potential to recognize epitopes that are poorly immunogenic in mice and humans [21]. For these reasons, both na\u00efve and immune phage libraries are frequently constructed from antibody genes collected from bone marrow, spleen, and other rabbit samples [20,22]. \n\nPhage display technology has been successfully applied for the detection of different allergens and pathogens related to food safety [17,[23][24][25][26]. However, studies concerning the generation of specific recombinant antibodies against the ovomucoid egg protein by phage display have not been described to date. The present study addresses this unexplored issue via the construction of a phage library displaying monoclonal scFvs obtained from an ovomucoid-immunized rabbit. The objective of this approach was the development of an indirect phage-ELISA based on the best-performing scFv candidate for the detection of hen's egg in commercial food products.",

            "text": "The versatility of phage display has revolutionized various fields ranging from antibody discovery (Parmley and Smith, 1988;Fellouse et al., 2007;Thie et al., 2009;Jones et al., 2010) to protein-protein interaction studies (Fuh et al., 2000;Hertveldt et al., 2009). Phage displays enable rapid antibody identification with the desired binding properties and contribute to deciphering protein networks and molecular interactions, thus leading to advancements in diagnostics (Kirsch et al., 2008;Deutscher, 2010;Kuhn et al., 2016;Li et al., 2023), therapeutics (Ladner et al., 2004;Saw and Song, 2019;Daly et al., 2023), and vaccine development (Gnanasekar et al., 2004;Wang and Yu, 2005;Aghebati-Maleki et al., 2016;Sol\u00eds-Lucero et al., 2016;Stern et al., 2019;Staquicini et al., 2021;Grabowski et al., 2023). Phage displays also hold promise for applications in nanotechnology and biomaterials. For example, phage display-selected peptides demonstrate a penchant for binding to diverse nanoparticles such as ZnO (Golec et al., 2016) and Fe 3 O 4 (Rawlings et al., 2015;You et al., 2016) and can also act as biosensors for detecting explosives or pathogens (Jaworski et al., 2008;Gut\u00e9s et al., 2013;Rawlings et al., 2015;Peng and Chen, 2019;Wang et al., 2021). In the field of tissue engineering, this technique guides researchers in identifying peptides such as arginylglycylaspartic acid (RGD) by using phage display libraries (Pasqualini et al., 1997).",

Phage display antibody libraries offer one method by which mAbs can be selected for, without the use of conventional hybridoma technology. In this work, phage display technology was used to construct, select and characterize a combinatorial single chain fragment variable (scFv) antibody library against bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BoHV-1) from the immune repertoire of chickens immunized with the virus. In silico analysis of the hypervariable domains of the antibody heavy chains revealed a high frequency of scFv fragments with low variability, suggesting that selection had probably been carried out and favored by a few im-munogenic viral antigens. The reactivity of the scFv fragments selected against BoHV-1 was demon-strated by Phage-ELISA. A significant increase in antibody reactivity to the target was observed after six rounds of library selection, showing its potential use as a molecule for BoHV-1 diagnosis. The strategy described here opens up a field for the use of phage display as a tool for selection of mono-clonal antibodies that could be used for theranostic applications against infectious and parasitic dis-eases of veterinary interest.",

These antibodies are described in the section \"recombinant antibodies against toxins.\" The majority of antibodies against bacteria are developed in order to facilitate diagnostics in patients [67,68] and environmental samples [69,70]. In general, cultural and microbial detection of bacteria is regarded as standard in diagnostics for many pathogens, e.g. Mycobacterium tuberculosis [71] or Salmonella Typhimurium [72]. Since these methods are often time-consuming and require experienced lab personal, high throughput analysis is often limited. Real-time PCR measurements have been developed for the diagnostics of many bacteria [73], offering high sensitivity and specificity of detection. But sample treatment is still needed in many cases, including expensive and complex laboratory devices [74]. An other approach is MS for diagnostic, but this technology needs expensive devices [75]. Antibody-based diagnostic like ELISA would be more simple and easy to use, also in developing countries. \n\nIn order to generate antibodies with the desired-binding properties, phage-display has been used to select antibodies on proteins or polysaccharides of Chlamydophila psittaci [76], Chlamydia trachomatis [77], Haemophilus influenzae [78], Listeria monocytogenes [79], Mycobaterium bovis [35], Mycobacterium tuberculosis [68,80,81], Porphyromonas gingivalis [67], Ralstonia solanacearum [69], Salmonella Typhimurium [2,82], and Yersinia pestis [83].

            "text": "The large number of phage display-derived antibodies in clinical development demonstrates the value of this in vitro selection technology for the discovery of therapeutic antibodies. Phage display has not only proven to be a versatile and reliable platform technology for the discovery of \"fully\" human antibodies for over 2 decades, but it has been successfully used for the development of other types of peptide and protein therapeutics, such as ecallantide (Kalbitor \u00d2 , Dyax/Shire), 122 Xyntha purification peptide 204 and the peptibody trebananib (AMG-386, Amgen) 205 (for review see Nixon et al. 86 ).\n\nThe changing intellectual property landscape will further affect development. For many years access to antibody phage display was controlled by a few companies, based on their technology patents. But these, namely the Breitling/D\u20ac ubel (EP0440147) and McCafferty/Winter (EP0774511, EP0589877) families, expired in 2011 in Europe. In the US the patent US5969108 (filed 1990, granted 1991, published 1999), US6172197 (filed 1991, granted 1995, published 2001) and US6806079 (filed 1990, granted 2000, published 2004) are most relevant. The expiration of US patents is more complex and depends on variables such as the filling date, the grant date, patent term adjustments and extensions. Together with lower pricing driven by the competition with biosimilar products, the patent expiry should spur innovation and allow more companies to advance human antibodies made by phage display into the clinic.\n\nAntibody phage display has advantages over newer technologies like yeast or mammalian cell display, including library size (>10 10 ), robust and well-established E. coli expression system, scalability, short panning cycles and cost-efficiency, but also in vitro selection conditions and the ability to pan on antigen-expressing cells. Issues with E. coli expression and phage display of full size IgGs can be addressed with efficient expression platforms and screening technologies. 206 The power of phage display lies in the choice of the optimal in vitro selection conditions, which allows pre-definition of many biophysical and biochemical antibody properties at a very early step of the discovery process",

            "text": "Bacteriophages present a promising avenue, particularly as an alternative therapy in the battle against antibiotic-resistant bacteria [1,3]. Despite being discovered before antibiotics, phages were overshadowed by penicillin due to their perceived complexities and specificity [1]. The escalating AMR crisis drives the recent resurgence of interest in phages, necessitating the search for new effective treatment strategies, improved diagnostics, and better monitoring [3]. The increasing number of publications in the field of bacteriophage research over the past decade highlights this renewed focus. In this context, vibrational spectroscopy is emerging as a powerful platform for molecular characterization. \n\nPhages exhibit a natural selectivity toward bacteria while maintaining a non-hostile relationship with mammalian cells, making them excellent candidates for bacterial targeting. The ability of VS to characterize molecular compositions and, especially, to discriminate between DNA and RNA signatures makes it highly compatible with the use of bacteriophages as labels for pathogens, providing a promising new avenue in pathogen detection. This synergy is especially favorable for developing new diagnostic tools, in which the rapid acquisition of spectra using techniques like ATR-FTIR offers high-speed diagnostics. The advancement of chemometrics-assisted complex data analysis further enhances the sensitivity of detecting minor alterations, making the combination of phage-based targeting and spectroscopic techniques a powerful strategy for pathogen detection. \n\nThe implications of this approach extend beyond healthcare and clinical diagnostics. The One Health concept recognizes the interdependence of human, animal, plant, and ecosystem health, emphasizing the need for a holistic pathogen detection and treatment strategy. Phage-VS methodologies can be applied to all these samples, thus playing a crucial role in environmental and food safety. \n\nFurthermore, bacteriophages offer extensive potential as biosensors that greatly exceed their innate ability to target bacteria due to the phage display technology [5,66]. Initially introduced for presenting polypeptides on lysogenic filamentous bacteriophages, phage display is now efficiently used to display a great variety of peptides, proteins, and antibodies [5].

            "text": "Immunoassays play a crucial role in rapidly screening biotoxin residues in the environment for human health protection. However, their traditional approach involving large quantities of toxic biotoxins or complex chemical synthesis of coated antigens and tracers presents challenges. The chemical synthesis process suffers from drawbacks like intricate procedures, batch errors, low binding efficiency, and the use of organic solvents. As an innovative substitute, immunosensor mimotopes, such as simulated peptides and anti-idiotype antibodies, offer a safer option for these immunoassays. Utilizing phage display or monoclonal/polyclonal antibody technology, immunosensor mimotopes serve as competing antigens, tracers, or standard substitutes. They eliminate the need for toxic compounds and provide an ecofriendly analytical tool for biotoxin detection, addressing issues of batch errors, low binding efficiency, and organic solvent usage. Immunosensor mimotopes hold immense promise as reagents in the detection of cholera toxins. \n\nPhage M13, widely used in mimotope biopanning, offers a versatile approach for detecting small analytes, including biotoxins, via M13 phage display technology. Construction of random peptide or recombinant antibody libraries facilitates the selection of alternative antigens or antibodies. The choice between libraries should consider specific application requirements, as each possesses distinct advantages and limitations. Random peptide libraries, simpler to construct, exhibit a broad epitope recognition range, including continuous and discontinuous sequences, allowing specific binding to various proteins or ligands. Conversely, recombinant antibody libraries offer higher affinity and specificity for the target analyte. In cholera toxin detection, the use of phage M13 in mimotope screening presents a powerful tool for alternative antigen or antibody development. Random peptide libraries demonstrate particular utility in detecting small antigens without bias. However, they may exhibit lower affinity, limiting certain applications. In such cases, recombinant antibody libraries become a preferred choice, yielding antibodies with superior affinity. Thus, between random peptide and recombinant antibody libraries hinges on the specific needs of the intended application, ensuring optimal results for cholera toxin detection.",

            "text": "Necitumumab was also isolated from de Haard and collaborators' library by using A431 carcinoma cells, which express high levels of EGFR. Competition with cetuximab for binding to the cell surface generated one clone, termed 11F8, which displayed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on EGF-stimulated EGFR activation in A431 cells. A comparison of the structures of Fab11F8 with the Fab derived from cetuximab (FabC225) both in complex with EGFR, indicated that the epitope of the two Fabs was remarkably similar, but the antibodies having different CDRs, bound EGFR through a set of different interactions (39). Necitumumab, the new fully human antibody was thus developed, had similar biological properties to cetuximab, but without the disadvantages of a chimeric antibody. \n\nUntil relatively recently, phage display technology was controlled by a few companies, holding their technology patents (102). These patents expired in Europe and the United States, thus, allowing the free use of the antibody discovery methodology via phage display by academic laboratories and small biotech organizations. As phage display technology has become a commodity, several companies such as BioRad using HuCAL \u00ae (103), Distributed Bio via SuperHuman synthetic libraries, 2 and GlobalBio/ADL by means of semi-synthetic ALTHEA Gold Libraries\u2122 3 are licensing phage display libraries and/or offering discovery services at a relatively low cost without royalty payments. \n\nIn addition to phage, other display platforms have been developed, including ribosome (104), bacteria (105), yeast (106), and mammalian (107) display. Each of these platforms has advantages and disadvantages. One of the advantages of yeast display, which is the most commonly used, over phage display is the screening using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. This advantage has proven to be an efficient means to isolate antibodies with very high affinity, e.g., in the low femtomolar range (108). In addition, while phage is limited to the display of antibody fragments such as scFvs or Fabs, yeast enables the display of full IgG antibodies with glycosylation.",

            "text": "Up to date, a vast plethora of antibodies for diagnostic applications has been generated via phage-display against different bacterial proteins or carbohydrates (Table 1). Interestingly, research on this field seems to be in constant rise, as 44% of these antibodies have been generated only in the past five years. \n\nIn the following paragraphs, we offer detailed examples on antibodies against different bacterial pathogens that were generated using phage display. \n\nMycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is the bacteria responsible for a lung infection known as Tuberculosis (TB). This pathogen specifically attacks and replicates inside the macrophage cells in the alveoli, causing fatigue, fever and coughing (Fu and Fu-Liu, 2002). As of 2021, this disease affected approximately 10 million people and caused 1.5 million deaths worldwide per year (World Health Organization, 2021). TB early diagnosis is essential to improve treatment and limit disease spread. The protein secreted by Mtb in the highest amounts, Antigen 85 (Ag85), represents an ideal target for diagnostics (Wiker and Harboe, 1992). Ag85 is an oligomeric protein composed of three relatively small (30-32 kDa) homologue proteins (Ag85A, Ag85B and Ag85C) (Wiker et al., 1992). In a novel approach described by Ferrara et al. (2012), a combination of antibody display techniques was successfully adopted to select Ag85 complex-specific antibodies. A universal phage display na\u00efve scFv-library with a nominal diversity of ~10 11 unique antibodies was used for initial selection on Ag85, obtaining a sub-library of 10 5 pre-selected antibodies. Second, the selected antigen-specific scFv genes were used for the generation of yeast-display antibody sub-library. Upon completion of yeast based antibody generation, each clone was tested in FACS for its ability to specifically recognize the antigen target resulting in the discovery of 192 clones having the desired properties. Sequence analysis revealed that 111 of these antibodies were unique and could be used in further Ab characterization. Chessboard antibody combination testing resulted in the identification of 7 antibody pairs that detect as little as 22.7 nM Ag85 in patient sera or 6.1 nM in serum freeconditions.",

            "text": "An exemplar application of immunosensor mimotopes in toxin detection lies in the novel cholera toxin (CT) assay, accomplished through phage-ELISA. Traditionally, competitive antigens are indispensable for immunoassays targeting small molecules, necessitating the laborious synthesis of substantial quantities of these toxic small-molecular toxins. Leveraging mimotopes in immunoassays can circumvent the utilization of such hazardous compounds. In comparison to alternative analytical methods, immunoassays offer numerous advantages for rapid detection, boasting heightened sensitivity, augmented specificity, and simplified sample preparation (119). The inherent diminutive size of specific toxin mimotopes presents a challenge in their direct fixation to solid surfaces for immunoassays. Instead, these simulated peptides are ingeniously conjugated with specific proteins to generate fusion proteins amenable for immunoassays (120). A direct and effective approach involves utilizing M13 phages as coated antigens, in conjunction with the specific mimotope. Among the diverse immunoassay techniques, ELISA stands as a widely employed method for toxin detection. Consequently, employing specific mimotopes as antigen-coated phages within ELISA (phage-ELISA) presents a feasible and promising avenue (121). The mimotope, initially selected from a phage display library, underwent biotinylation for subsequent use as a competing antigen in the ELISA assay. To ensure specific recognition by the anti-CT monoclonal antibody, the mimotope was ingeniously fused to the p3 protein of the M13 phage. Detection of the biotinylated mimotope was achieved through the application of streptavidinlabeled polymeric horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Remarkably, this phage-ELISA approach exhibited remarkable sensitivity, boasting a detection limit of 0.05 ng/mL, surpassing traditional ELISA methods by 200-fold. By employing mimotopes in phage-ELISA assays, this method not only ensures enhanced sensitivity but also offers a safer and more efficient alternative, obviating the necessity for toxic small-molecule toxins.",

Similarly, Throsby et al., using combinatorial display libraries constructed from human memory B cells elicited by seasonal influenza vaccination, isolated 13 antibodies exhibiting broad heterosubtypic neutralizing activity against antigenically diverse H1, H2, H5, H6, H8 and H9 influenza subtypes (84). The most potent antibody was also protective in mice when given before and after lethal H5N1 or H1N1 challenge and the epitope was localized to the highly conserved Therapeutic antibodies from phage display 653 membrane-proximal stem of the HA1 and HA2 subunits of hemagglutinin (84,85). \n\nUsing a combination of panning strategies against the hemagglutinin from several antigenically distinct H5N1 isolates to bias-selection of antibodies towards more conserved domains of the protein, we were able to isolate similar antibodies to that described by Throsby et al. from a non-immune Fab phage display library (11). The selection of such antibodies from even non-immune phage displayed libraries highlights the potential of these readily available libraries for the development of therapeutically relevant antibodies against emerging pathogens of high concern and may enable more rapid development of therapies against novel emergent pathogens in the future.",

            "text": "This set of experiments showed that \"genotypeto-phenotype linkage\" could be achieved and thereby defi ned the basis of all display technologies developed since. \n\nThe subsequent development of a method for the effective cloning of antibody V-gene sequences via PCR allowed the capture of antibody sequences in a recombinant form [ 6 ], removing the need to immortalize B-cells via hybridoma fusion as required in traditional monoclonal antibody generation. This discovery was combined with the phage display process to make an effi cient method of isolating antibodies and their corresponding gene sequences simultaneously [ 7 ]. In the antibody phage display process, libraries of diverse V-gene sequences are cloned into an appropriate expression vector in E. coli , creating an in-frame fusion with the p3 protein or, as favored in most recently described libraries, a truncated form of p3. \n\nThe phage display of protein libraries was originally performed using \"phage\" vectors (i.e., built upon the phage genome itself), but due to practical diffi culties in handling these libraries, more recent phage methods have mostly used so-called phagemid expression vectors. In this case, the DNA backbone is a stable, small plasmid such as pUC, and the p3 gene plus f1 phage packaging origin are the only phage-derived DNA sequences [ 8 ]. These phagemid libraries are more easily handled and more stable than phage libraries, as the plasmid is incapable of causing phage production by itself. The libraries can therefore be more simply cloned, expanded, and controlled than phage libraries. \n\nBy infecting \"helper\" phage (based on M13) into a growing culture of E. coli harboring a phagemid library, the phage propagation machinery is provided, but due to a mutation introduced in the origin of replication on the helper phage genome, preferential packaging of the phagemid DNA and p3 fusion occurs during phage replication [ 8 ]. Phage production is thereby induced, genotype-to-phenotype linkage is created, and the expressed phage particles are interrogated for the presence of useful protein sequences via target binding.",

The majority of these candidates originate from a few company-owned libraries: Cambridge Antibody Technology's (CAT, now MedImmune, subsidiary of AstraZeneca) scFv-fragment library, 13 Dyax Corp's human Fab-fragment libraries, 11,12 and MorphoSys's human combinatorial antibody scFv-fragment (HuCAL\u00ae) and Fab-fragment (HuCALGold\u00ae) libraries. 14,15 The case reviews were developed using information available in both the primary literature and patent information. \n\nAdalimumab (Humira) Adalimumab (Humira\u00ae; AbbVie Inc., formerly Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL) is a human IgG\u03ba antibody that binds tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and blocks its activation of TNF receptors. The biospecificity of adalimumab demonstrates a realization of the expected advantages of phage display as a drug discovery technology. Additionally, the case of adalimumab demonstrates the contribution of phage display, in conjunction with guided selection methods. Adalimumab is approved for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis and plaque psoriasis. 25 According to the boxed warning in the US prescriber information, adalimumab is associated with a risk of serious infections and malignancy. 25 dalimumab was discovered using phage display with a \"guided selection\" method involving a mouse mAb. Briefly, the heavy chain of a murine antibody able to bind to TNF was combined with a collection of human light chains and selected for binding to hTNF. The selected light chains were then combined with a collection of human heavy chains and further selected for binding to hTNF and to an N-terminal peptide of hTNF. 26 In this strategy, a library of candidates is applied to immobilized antigen in the presence of a competitor that binds at the active site of interest.",

            "text": "Identifying antibodies with high affinity and target specificity is crucial for drug discovery and development; however, filtering out antibody candidates with nonspecific or polyspecific binding profiles is also important. In this issue of Cell Reports Methods, Saksena et al. report a computational counterselection method combining deep sequencing and machine learning for identifying nonspecific antibody candidates and demonstrate that it has advantages over more established molecular counterselection methods. \n\nTraditional antibody discovery processes make heavy use of screening platforms, such as phage, yeast, and mammalian display technologies (Parola et al., 2018). These methods link the phenotype and genotype of proteins displayed and allow for rapid selection of large libraries of proteins including antibodies and antibody fragments. For phage display, the platform used in Saksena et al. (2022), the most common type of antibody fragments displayed are single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) and antigen-binding fragments (Fabs). Till now, phage display libraries with diversities up to 10 11 sequences have been constructed and used extensively for antibody drug discovery. Traditional discovery by display platforms consist of performing several rounds of selection against target antigens, resulting in a pool of antigenspecific clones that then undergo additional experimental characterization and possibly follow-up engineering (e.g., affinity maturation) to select for therapeutic lead candidates. \n\nIn addition to high affinity to the target, a critical property for any antibody drug candidate is having minimal off-target binding. However, antibodies with offtarget binding may also become enriched and selected through a screening process such as phage display. These polyspecific or nonspecific antibodies have the capacity to bind unrelated antigens and are often linked to non-ideal pharmacokinetic profiles (Ho \u00a8tzel et al., 2012). There has been evidence that suggests nonspecific antibody sequences can be identified through shared features. For example, the VH6 germline family was identified as a source of nonspecific clones derived from a yeast-displayed naive human antibody library (Kelly et al., 2017). Additionally, certain physicochemical properties of amino acids in antibody variable regions have been found to be associated with nonspecific binding (Zhang et al., 2020).",

            "text": "apidly generating diagnostic and environmental surveillance tests to emerging biothreats is one route to supplementing the toolbox of countermeasures required to help safeguard human health. Making recombinant antibodies to formulate such immunoassays has many advantages over classical hybridoma technology or polyclonal sera generation including the ability to select for the desired levels of specificity/crossreactivity and affinity, and employ directed evolution to enhance these properties further (for review see 1 ). Currently, several methods exist for selecting recombinant antibodies from repertoires including phage, yeast and ribosome display among the more popular. The essence of each method is a link of each antibody phenotype to its genotype to allow antigen binding clones to be enriched from a large starting panel of antibodies. The panels can be generated by cloning the variable domains from hosts immunized with the antigen of interest; usually several million clones are sufficient to ensure antigen reactive clones are represented. Alternatively the panel can be made by cloning variable domains from a sufficiently high number of non-immune hosts, or assembling synthetic or semi-synthetic repertoires with artificially diversified antigen contact loops; usually several billion (1e19 and upwards) is required to ensure antigen binding clones with reasonably high affinities can be reliably isolated. The latter approach enables the same panel of antibodies (a ''single pot'' library) to be used for multiple antigens of interest and since inception 2 has become both ethically and financially appealing as well as fast since it bypasses several weeks to months required to generate an immune response and clone the resulting repertoire. Phage display is typically used for these larger libraries since it is straightforward to use and multiple representations of each clone can be present in small volumes owing to the size of the phage particles, thereby enabling multiple parallel selections with minimal equipment. Selections typically involve allowing the phage panels to bind immobilized antigen, eluting the binders and amplifying them in E. coli and repeating the process until a sufficient percentage of the population are antigen-specific and give rise to a polyclonal phage ELISA positive signal.",

This process entails integrating genetic material encoding antibody fragments, such as antibodies' heavy and light chains, single-chain variable fragments (scFvs), Fabs, or peptides, into the genome of bacteriophages, notably filamentous ones like M13 [10]. This fusion results in the expression of a multitude of unique antibody candidates on the surface of phages, forming the basis of the library. The diversity of this library, ranging from millions to billions of variants, lays the groundwork for the subsequent exploration of potential binding partners (Figure 1) [11]. \n\nfoundation for the subsequent refinement and enhancement of phage display technology. The significant contributions of George P. Smith and Greg Winter culminated in the recognition of a half share of the 2018 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their seminal work in developing phage display. \n\nUp to now, the impact of phage display in generating antibodies extends across diverse applications. In the field of therapeutics, it has played a pivotal role in the development of monoclonal antibodies for various diseases, including cancer, autoimmune disorders, infectious diseases, and neurological conditions. Furthermore, phage display has significantly contributed to the discovery of antibodies targeting specific viral pathogens, such as influenza and HIV, providing valuable tools for both diagnosis and treatment [7,8]. Beyond therapeutics, phage display has been instrumental in antibody engineering, epitope mapping, and the study of protein interactions. Additionally, it has facilitated the identification of novel peptide ligands for drug targeting, the development of biosensors for disease detection, and the creation of protein libraries for enzyme optimization and protein-protein interaction studies [9]. Overall, phage display continues to revolutionize biotechnology and biomedical research by enabling the rapid and efficient generation of high-affinity antibodies and protein-based therapeutics for a wide range of applications.",

            "text": "Culture-dependent methods are the gold standard for sensitive and specific detection of pathogenic bacteria within the food production chain. In contrast to molecular approaches, these methods detect viable cells, which is a key advantage for foods generated from heat-inactivated source material. However, culture-based diagnostics are typically much slower than molecular or proteomic strategies. Reporter phage assays combine the best of both worlds and allow for near online assessment of microbial safety because phage replication is extremely fast, highly target specific, and restricted to metabolically active host cells. In addition, reporter phage assays are inexpensive and do not require highly trained personnel, facilitating their on-site implementation. The reporter phages presented in this study not only allow for rapid detection but also enable an early estimation of the potential virulence of Listeria isolates from food production and processing sites. ABSTRACT The pathogen Listeria monocytogenes causes listeriosis, a severe foodborne disease associated with high mortality. Rapid and sensitive methods are required for specific detection of this pathogen during food production. Bioluminescence-based reporter bacteriophages are genetically engineered viruses that infect their host cells with high specificity and transduce a heterologous luciferase gene whose activity can be detected with high sensitivity to indicate the presence of viable target cells. Here, we use synthetic biology for de novo genome assembly and activation as well as CRISPR-Cas-assisted phage engineering to construct a set of reporter phages for the detection and differentiation of viable Listeria cells. Based on a single phage backbone, we compare the performance of four reporter phages that encode different crustacean, cnidarian, and bacterial luciferases. From this panel of reporter proteins, nanoluciferase (NLuc) was identified as a superior enzyme and was subsequently introduced into the genomes of a broad host range phage (A511) and two serovar 1/2- and serovar 4b/6a-specific Listeria phages (A006 and A500, respectively). The broad-range NLuc-based phage A511::nlucCPS detects one CFU of L. monocytogenes in 25 g of artificially contaminated milk, cold cuts, and lettuce within less than 24",

It starts from CDR grafting onto a human germline framework and is based on the randomization of Vernier residues, key residues for CDR orientation. Exemplarily, the CDRs of two chicken-derived scFvs were grafted onto a human acceptor framework. Simultaneous randomization of 10 Vernier residues in the VH and VL domains resulted in yeast libraries expressing humanized scFv and Fab fragments. Via YSD and FACS, high affine antibodies were isolated, and the sequences were verified by NGS. It was observed that the Vernier residues enriched after two sorting rounds correlate between both antibody formats (Figure 2A,B; Figure S6A,B, Supporting Information). A similar strategy was applied by Nishibori et al. using a phage display strategy. For this type of humanization strategy, the known feature of yeast surface display selection to discriminate between low and high-affinity binders allows for the fast enrichment of sequences encoding functional antibody fragments. Phage display screening required seven rounds of panning and phage amplification, [26] while YSD required only two screening rounds to enrich high-affinity binders. While in previous work by Nishibori et al. the \"most humanized\" antibodies from their phage display campaign after panning were selected, [26] we identified variants that showed the strongest enrichment within two rounds of sorting by NGS. Due to FACS-assisted sorting, a more stringent selection could be performed and the number of screening rounds was significantly reduced, resulting in a fast and convenient humanization process. Furthermore, we investigated the possibility to transform scFv molecules into full-length antibodies during humanization. This combines the fast library generation and screening process of single-chain antibodies [31] with the foreseen beneficial properties of full-length mAbs. [39] hile aiming at reducing immunogenicity, the main issue in humanization campaigns is to restore the properties of the parental antibody.",

            "text": "Recently, recombinant antibodies or antibody fragments (including nanobodies), produced through the phage display library, have emerged as important research tools. Phage display is a technique that involves the expression of specific peptides or proteins (antibodies or single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) of antibodies) on the surface of bacteriophages [25]. Most often, phage libraries are based on scFvs, which are the smallest functional antibody fragments responsible for antigen interactions. Antibody libraries are generated by preparing template cDNA from B cells of non-immunised donors, followed by the amplification of the heavy-and light-chain antibody fragments. A diverse array of antibody variants can be generated on the surface of the phages. Screening these phage libraries enables the selection of the specific phage that interacts with the selected antigen. This technique mimics the natural process of antibody production with an increase in the affinity of the antibodies with the antigen. The use of phages is a fast and cost-effective alternative to mAb production, as antibodies can be produced entirely in vitro, without requiring an immunisation procedure. Additionally, this method allows for the improvement of existing mAbs and utilises human antibody genes as a source for phage libraries. This circumvents the need for complex techniques to humanise animal-derived antibodies [25]. \n\nIn the following sections of the paper, we present key information on the passive immunoprophylaxis used in the treatment of botulism, tetanus, and diphtheria-diseases characterised by symptoms resulting from the action of highly potent bacterial toxins. Therefore, the purpose of botulism, tetanus, and diphtheria therapies is to inactivate the circulating toxin and prevent its binding to tissues by using a passive immunisation treatment as a post-exposure approach and/or prophylaxis. Currently, the primary treatment for botulism, tetanus, and diphtheria consists of the administration of antitoxins, which can neutralize the toxins. Antibiotics are used very rarely and not in every case of illness.",

            "title": "Practical Tips for Construction of Custom Peptide Libraries and Affinity Selection by Using Commercially Available Phage Display Cloning Systems",
            "text": "Phage display technology was born in 1985 when George Smith reported that foreign peptide could be displayed on the surface of filamentous bacteriophage [3]. Today, the phage display is a versatile tool for finding specific interactions between randomized library peptides/proteins on phage and target proteins, peptides, or other molecules. For example, it is applicable for generation of therapeutic peptides against cancer [4], microbe [5], novel functional protein [6], or fully humanized monoclonal antibody [7]. The advantages of the phage display technology over other selection methods are as follows. (1) Cost of a routine is cheap. (2) Time required for selection/amplification is fast. (3) Extreme care for handling, such as RNA isolation/ selection, is not necessary. The phage is a DNA-containing virus that infects bacteria and makes many copies of the library within a very short time [8]. \n\nA phage that specifically binds a target can be selected from mixtures of billions of phages, propagated by in vivo amplification, and then subjected to additional rounds of affinity selection (Figure 1). This whole process is so-called \"biopanning\" [9]. After multiple rounds of the biopanning, enrichment of target-binding phage can be assessed by phage titering and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Finally, the peptide displayed on the phage can be analyzed by DNA sequencing. \n\n1.1. Categorization of Phage Display Systems. Based on vector systems, the phage display systems can be categorized into two classes. One is a true phage vector system. The phage vector is often derived from genes encoding all phage proteins [10]. The library is to be cloned as a fusion with a component gene, which originally exists in the phage genome. Alternatively, some libraries are to be inserted in the same vector as an additional fusion gene encoding a displaying peptide and a phage protein [11]. \n\nAnother is a phagemid vector system. The phagemid is a plasmid containing both a phage-derived replication origin and a plasmid-derived one [12].",

The display of the Fab fragment was developed using pDong1/Fab with the help of the KM13 helper phage, which allows specific recovery of antigen-binding phages by protease treatment [19]. For construction of antibody library, the V H and V L genes of antibodies were amplified and their DNA fragments detected at 350-400 bp were considered target genes (Figure 1A). A phage display antibody library with a diversity of 5610 5 was obtained using the phagemid pDong1/Fab. After three rounds of selection, the enrichment of NcSAG1-binding phage was confirmed using an ELISA with original phage library R0 and sublibraries R1, R2, and R3 that were amplified in each step of biopanning. Absorbance at 450 nm in phage ELISA for R0, R1, R2, and R3 phage against rNcSAG1 increased with the increase of biopanning step (Figure 1B), suggesting that three rounds of biopanning enriched the rNcSAG1-specific Fab-phages. Those R0-R3 phage did not bind to BSA as a negative control. \n\nPhages obtained in the third round were used to infect E. coli TG-1 for forming colonies. Ninety-six colonies were picked up, cultivated for forming phage. Two clones A10 and H3 showed strong signal against immobilized rNcSAG1 (Figure 1C). The binding capacity of A10 and H3 Fab-phage was also reconfirmed against rNcSAG1. A10 and H3 clones bound to rNcSAG1 but not to BSA (Figure 1D), suggesting their specificity to rNcSAG1. The KM13 helper phage on which no antibody was displayed was used as a control and did not bind to immobilized NcSAG1.",

            "text": "Because of the lack of strict regulation of their use as therapeutics, phage-based products are more widely considered for detection of pathogens in areas, such as food industry, water quality surveillance, or bioterrorism, where contaminations are frequently responsible of gastroenteritis, respiratory and mucosa infections, and if not worse, sequelae.\n\n6.1. Bacteria Biosensors. Gastrointestinal epidemics, as the outbreak occurred in Germany in 2011 caused by Shiga toxin-producing strain E. coli O104:H4, revealed a critical need of efficient tools for pathogen detection. Standard Oral decolonization Bacteraemia [84,97,106] microbiological methods for pathogen identification are time consuming; besides, molecular methods such as quantitative PCR (qPCR) or DNA hybridization require high-purity specimens [128]. Likewise, enzymatic assays such as ELISA are very sensitive but not suitable for high-throughput screenings. For these reasons, phage-based technology represents an alternative approach to prevent such outbreaks, and phages have been recently considered for biosensoring bacteria [129,130]. To date, some systems have been developed with E. coli 0157:H7 as their target, and two main groups of applications are available: one uses inert phage particles or their proteins, the other requires infecting phages [131,132]. In addition, phages are able to replicate at high titres and with low costs, they are more resistant to temperature or pH variations compared to antibodies and can be kept at room temperature without activity loss [133]. FASTPlaqueTB assay takes advantage of these characteristics for the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in sputum: phages (Actiphages) that infect the slow-growing tubercle bacillus survive to the addiction of a virucide (Virusol) and are then detected through their plaques on nonpathogenic mycobacterial sensor cells [134].\n\n6.2.

            "text": "To meet this demand, we have developed a simple, rapid, naked-eye method for detecting syphilis-specific antibodies from serum by creating a bioprobe based on the biorecognition of bacteriophage lysin and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). Bacteriophage (phage) lysins are peptidoglycan hydrolases secreted by phage to recognize and destroy the bacterial cell wall during the late lytic cycle of phages. Typically, a phage lysin contains a catalytic domain that hydrolyzes glycopeptide bonds 7 and a cell-binding domain (CBD) that binds to peptidoglycan on the bacterial cell surface. 8 PlyV12 is a lysin from the enterococcal bacteriophage \u03c61 that can recognize S. aureus, and its CBD binds to the peptidoglycan on the cell wall of S. aureus naturally with high affinity. 9 Here, we fused PlyV12 CBD to each of three recombinant antigens of T. pallidum (TPP15, TPP17, and TPP47). These antigens are the outer membrane lipoproteins of the pathogen, are highly expressed in all stages of syphilis, 10 and are the main diagnostic antigens applied in syphilis detection. 11 n each of the three resultant fusion proteins, the antigen is for recognizing the syphilis-specific antibody to be detected and the CBD is for recognizing an engineered redcolored S. aureus. Our team has developed the engineered red-colored S. aureus. 12 The fusion protein will bind the red-colored bacteria through the CBD segment, leaving the antigen segment protruding from the bacteria and thus generating a bioprobe capable of capturing the syphilisspecific antibody. When the bioprobe is added to the serum containing the syphilis-specific antibody, the bioprobe will capture the antibody and thus become agglutinated, allowing the formation of red-colored large particles for us to detect the antibody with naked eyes within 5 min (Scheme 1).",

In 2003, Weber et al. isolated B cells from a small amount of patient blood to generate the scFvs libraries by the phage display technology, and obtained the four anti-Scl-70 scFvs through phage screening (8). In contrast with these demerits on the use of native human antibodies, humanized monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) can reduce heterologous interference of mouse antibodies and also have several advantages, such as high specificity and affinity, small inter-batch difference, and easy industrial mass production (9). Humanized mAb improves the structure of traditional antibodies, making their application more targeted, functional, and operational, with the ability to achieve many functions that traditional antibodies cannot (10). However, a humanized anti-Scl-70 antibody substitute for positive patient serum has not been reported yet. \n\nIn this study, three anti-Scl-70 humanized antibodies from murine were characterized as specific, sensitive, and easily available artificial substitute for positive reference of SSc diagnosis. Physicochemical properties, three-dimensional structural basis, and electrostatic potential distribution of the protein surface of scFv were evaluated.

Infectious diseases have proved a productive area for investigation and in one example, antibodies against anthrax toxin have been shown to neutralize the lethal properties of this bacterial virulence factor (72). The pathogenesis of established (e.g., rotavirus (73)) and emergent viral agents (e.g., SARS (74,75)) can also be blocked by recombinant antibodies. Antibodies generated in this way have the potential for treatment of acute infection, blocking the disease process at a key point (e.g., interaction between a receptor and the pathogen (76) or its product(s) (72)). This provides a therapeutic option when the use of antibiotics or antiviral compounds is undesirable or impossible (77). It also offers prophylaxis when vaccines are unavailable (78) or the patient is unable to mount a protective response as a consequence of vaccination (79). \n\nThese areas of application deal with infectious agents, but antibody phage display has also been widely applied to the search for antibodies with antitumor activities. Careful design of the selection strategy has enabled, for example, investigators to isolate antibodies that are specific for markers expressed on transformed cells but absent from nontransformed primary cells (80). Therapeutic application need not trigger complement -recruitment of effector cells (81,82) can be exploited and in some cases, internalization of the recombinant antibody can have directly antiproliferative effects (83).",

            "text": "In recent years the use of monoclonal chicken IgY antibodies derived from phage display technology has been widely studied and promising results of producing neutralizing antibodies has been observed by different research groups. It was in 1985 when George smith first used this technology, which used an expression vector, having a capability of presenting the foreign amino acid sequences, which could bind to the antibody [66]. This technology was considered as an alternative to the conventional production of monoclonal antibodies using hybridoma technology. The major advantage of using PDT is that the generation of scFv/ Fab fragments specific to a particular antigen can be performed within few weeks [67]. The immunoglobulin repertoire of chickens is ideally suited for phage display, as it is generated from a single set of V H and V L germ line sequence [68]. The phage  display system is considered as a fast and valuable technique for monoclonal antibody production against broad viral infections [69]. In the conventional monoclonal antibody production through hybridoma technology, the lymphocytes are isolated, immortalized by hybridization with myeloma cells which paves a way for in vitro cloning in eukaryotic cell culture system. Whereas in the phage display technology, the prokaryotic system is used for cloning the cells. In brief, for phage display technology, first the lymphocytes are being isolated from spleen of the host animal, followed by encoding the DNA of the binding region of immunoglobulins in new expression system. The RNA is prepared from lymphocytes and reverse transcripted into cDNA. The variable regions of immunoglobulin antibody cDNA are amplified by PCR. The DNA is then ligated into suitable vectors, which are then used for transformation of E. coli. The next step, the latter are infected with helper phages. The result is that the bacteria expresses and releases phage particles containing the vector DNA, showing the engineered antibody protein on their surfaces [70] (Fig. 3).\n\nThe scFv antibody (IgY) library from immune spleen cells of chickens against virulent infectious bursal disease virus (vvIBDV) strain CS89 for detection and differentiation of vvIBDV from other IBDV strains",

            "text": ", this method requires the standardized preparation of whole cell extracts from serovars most relevant to the geographical region [10].\n\nPhage display is mainly used for antibody generation [11], but also for the identification of pathogen-associated immunogenic proteins; for the latter, it is based on using fragmented pathogen genomes or cDNA fragments to allow high-throughput screening for novel potential antigens [12][13][14][15][16]. Immunogenic proteins are often identified using 2D-PAGE of proteins from cultivated bacteria followed by mass spectrometry. However, phage display offers clear advantages, notably better performance for the identification of immunogenic proteins below 10 kD, low abundance proteins, and proteins only expressed in host-pathogen interaction [17,18]. ORFeome phage display is an improved variant of the phage display technique in which the library quality of fragmented genomes or cDNA fragments is improved by a unique open reading frame enrichment step [19][20][21][22].\n\nDiagnostics for use in hot, resource-limiting environments should be inexpensive to produce and stable at ambient temperature. Peptide antigens fulfil both requirements; besides, they offer the added advantage that they can be synthesized in biotinylated form, thus facilitating their use in streptavidin-based diagnostics.\n\nIn the present study, we have used ORFeome phage display to identify L. interrogans peptides that are immunogenic in humans and can be used to develop relatively inexpensive diagnostics tools for this challenging pathogen.",

While in some cases the results of these studies have been promising, antibody epitope-based peptide vaccines are no longer an area of active research for several reasons: (i) in many cases, peptides incompletely or inadequately mimic epitopes on folded proteins (Irving et al., 2010; see below); \n\n(ii) antibodies against a single epitope may be of limited utility, especially for highly variable pathogens (Van Regenmortel, 2012); and (iii) for pathogens for which protective immune responses are generated efficiently during natural infection, peptide vaccines offer few advantages over recombinant subunit and live vector vaccines, which have become easier to produce over time. \n\nMore recently, peptide-displaying phage have been used in attempts to generate therapeutic antibody responses for chronic diseases, cancer, immunotherapy, and immunocontraception.",

            "text": "During the last century, bacteriophages have been screened and utilized for the purpose of therapy for various diseases caused by pathogens. Since the discovery of antibiotics in Western Europe, the use of phage for therapeutic purposes was reduced and restricted in the area of Eastern Europe. However, emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains, this phage therapy has recently been revisited and reissued. While many phages have been isolated and characterized for application of phage therapy, they also have been considered as novel biocontrol agents to control various food-borne pathogens. For food applications, phages are considered as natural food preservatives as well as rapid detection tools of food-borne pathogens. Numerous studies have been reported showing that phages may be useful for controlling specific food-borne pathogen with high safety for humans. Although phages are very useful and safe for food applications, they are not widely used because they still need some time to make the customers understand the advantage of phages as natural food preservatives. Because of this, well-designed experimental clinical studies should be performed to convince the customers that phage is highly safe and no harm to humans. To overcome the low preference to phage applications, endolysin with high host specificity and lysis activity has been suggested and developed. However, this enzyme still needs to be optimized experimentally and enhanced by molecular protein engineering. For rapid detection of food-borne pathogens in foods, PCRand antibody-based methods are generally used. However, these detection methods still have some problems including long reaction time, no knowledge of molecular techniques, high detection limit, etc. Based on the host specificity of phages, CBD from endolysin and reporter phage system have been suggested to detect food-borne pathogens for rapid detection without additional equipment or reagents, suggesting the next-generation rapid detection system of pathogens. Furthermore, CBD has similar characteristics including high specificity and binding activity to antibodies. Therefore, CBD has recently been suggested to be an alternative material of antibodies because CBD is much cheaper to be produced using E. coli overexpression/ purification system with much higher host specificity and binding activity than antibody. Therefore, antibody in some parts of the market may sooner or later be replaced by CBD.",

            "text": "Besides phage display, an ever more popular approach to generate human antibodies deploys humanized mice engineered to express human immunoglobulin chains. Several models have been generated over the past 25 years by different engineering strategies (reviewed in [126]). These transgenic animals can be vaccinated with human antigens, and single B-cell clones or derived hybridomas can be screened for the production of targeting antibodies via ELISA or flow cytometry-based assays. Companies like TRIANNI Inc., Kymab Limited [127], and Creative Biolabs [128] developed proprietary animal models to pursue this strategy. These platforms feed internal pipelines with novel biologics and are available to academic and private institutions in a pay-for-service modality or through the licensing of animals. Advantages include generation in vivo of high affinity, matured IgG antibodies (preferred format for therapy) bypassing additional affinity maturation steps typically used in phage display, high efficiency of the system and low hands-on-time required, ease of automation and throughput of screening. However, this strategy is not suited to raise antibodies against antigens extremely conserved between human and mouse since the murine immune system counter selects self-antigens to prevent the generation of autoantibodies. Human synthetic antibody phage display libraries, on the contrary, can be used to raise antibodies against any moiety at the cost of longer subsequent optimization steps. Both technologies have contributed to the generation of clinically relevant antibodies in several fields [129].",

            "text": "The phage display (PD) technology has been widely used to identify a great number of ligands, including peptides and antibodies (Smith, 1985). So, it is possible to obtain small peptides that mimic specific antigen epitopes (Goulart et al., 2010), or develop biomarkers using Fab (fragment antigen-binding) or scFv (single-chain variable fragment) antibody fragments (Leow et al., 2014). One of the great advantages of peptides and antibodies obtained by PD is their flexibility to be used in different diagnostic platforms, from conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Rojas et al., 2014) to biotechnological platforms, such as those involving immunosensors based on surface plasmon resonance (SPR) (Kim et al., 2015). SPR immunosensors explore the capacity of an antibody to recognize its antigen with different affinities and can be built using an optical signal transduction by a light bean that passes through a prism and reaches a metallic surface (Kretschmann, 1971). These immunosensors represent a great advance to the creation of diagnostic platforms, enabling real time, quantitative, and much more sensitive analysis than the conventional immunoassays (Ngubane et al., 2013). \n\nHere, we present a successful PGL-I mimetic chimeric peptide (mimotope) obtained by PD, which was chemically synthesized with similar immunological properties of the natural antigen. The mimotope was validated by ELISA and SPR, and a reverse engineered antibody against the mimotope demonstrated that the peptide mimics the trisaccharide portion of the antigen. The characterization and diagnostic implications of this novel PGL-I-like peptide are discussed herein.",

            "text": "Phage display technology antibodies as nano-bio-engineered macromolecules can be used for sensor-based virus detection. In order to recognize lethal viruses such as Zika, Ebola, Hendra, Nipah, Hanta, Middle East respiratory disease (MERS), and SARS, phage display has been utilized to create new diagnostic tools [76,77]. In the current situation of the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers actively search for neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 for therapeutic use. Because phage display is an important antibody selection method, the prospects for the use of phage display, with special emphasis on its use in the diagnosis and therapy of coronavirus diseases, were shown by Anand et al. [77]. \n\nBy now, a huge pool of antibodies against various viruses has been obtained by phage display, by using na\u00efve or immune libraries. From na\u00efve antibody gene libraries, antibodies against human pathogenic viruses such as SARS coronavirus, dengue virus, influenza virus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, norovirus, and hepatitis C virus have been developed by using recombinant viral proteins or complete viral particles [78,79]. Other antibodies have been chosen from immune antibody gene libraries that target the influenza virus, HIV, SARS coronavirus, yellow fever virus, and Western equine encephalitis virus [79]. Even semisynthetic libraries have been utilized to prepare antibodies specific to the influenza virus [80]. In the past, libraries from several species have been used to successfully isolate virus-specific antibodies. \n\nBy using phage display, potential therapeutic agents are being developed for other human coronaviruses, such as SARS [81] and MERS [82], and for animal coronaviruses, such as infectious bronchitis virus, TGEV, and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus. Highaffinity/small-molecule antibodies have been identified for the E, N, and S proteins of SARS-CoV [77]. For example, Ubah and Palliyil [83] described the advantages of phage antibodies and the prospects for their use against various viral targets.",

            "text": "Phage (s) are considered as a biotechnological tool due to their simple structure and small nucleic acid content. Presently, for detection of biothreat agents various microbiological methods and biotests are being used. However, these methods take several hours to days for completion. Hence, real-time detectors or fast diagnostic methods are urgently needed to detect the presence of bioagents 69 . A new approach of fast detection includes use of phage antibody i.e., phage recombinants that display specific antibodies against a particular antigen. These phage antibodies can further be tagged with markers or fluorescent dye for quick and easy detection 70 . In addition to these, phage derived probes have been successfully used for detection of B. anthracis spores and S. typhimurium cells 69,71 . With latest discoveries and advancement in the field of biotechnological, phage therapy can be customised for targeting its host Fig. 3. For example, enzyme endolysin that is responsible for lysis of bacteria in bacteriophage can be over expressed in vitro, purified for direct administration, instead of using whole phage. Other use of biotechnology in phage therapy is to genetically modify phage for delivering specific molecules acting as antimicrobials 73 . Likewise, phage display technique is also a unique approach for synthesising polypeptides with novel characteristics. The concept of phage display is to express protein over the surface of phage particle, formed by fusing DNA that encodes the polypeptide with coat protein gene 74 . Phage's like M13, lambda and T7 are being used for phage display technique. The peptide displayed over phage can be used for drug designing, mimicking as receptor, to create library of highly specific proteins and also as a curative agent by hampering receptor-ligand interaction 74 . \n\npreserving, antibacterial agent and efficient candidate for phage therapy against biothreat agents. Phage therapy can be a safe, efficient and natural alternative to drug resistance antimicrobial. It is thus important to identify emerging biothreat agents along with other MDR bacteria and to isolate their specific phages and to store them for their use when required.",

Sample6 recently launched its DETECT/L kit on the back of luciferase-based recombinant phage technologies. 93 The kit correctly identifies 50 Listeria species, as well as correctly excluding 30 non-listeria species that were subjected to testing. However, converting luciferase-based assays to more optimal multiplex assays (i.e. assays that detect more than one bacterial species in a given sample) may not be straightforward, 95 which is an issue that could be circumvented by fluorescent-based reporter systems with compatible emission and excitation wavelengths. 96 he precision of phage host recognition has been explored for pathogen detection from environmental samples. Water quality control is one of the major concerns for public health as well as marine environment, and rapid methods need to be developed to allow accurate pathogen identification. One such method used a phage-based fluorescent biosensor 'phagosensor' prototype for enteric bacteria detection. 97 In this system, the synthesis of the fluorescent protein only occurs after it is delivered to E. coli TD2158 by temperate bacteriophage HK620 carrying the fluorescent gene. 98 The recombinant phages were incubated with the sample for one hour, followed by flow cytometry, which allowed sensitive detection of environmental E. coli TD2158 strain in diluted samples, and in mixed co-cultures. The established template was also successfully adapted to phage P22 to detect Salmonella enterica Typhimurium. 99 olorimetry is another method for detecting pathogenic bacteria in water.",

            "text": "responses to infection. The methodology links the genotype and phenotype of the peptides as each phage displays multiple copies of a peptide on its surface and contains the concomitant gene for the peptide within its genome. The display system allows the isolation of a particular peptide based on its binding activity to an antibody and in parallel the corresponding gene is also isolated. During traditional phage display methods the peptide library is propagated in bacteria and then bound to antibody that is usually immobilised on a solid support. The majority of non-binding phage are washed away and the bound phage are then eluted, usually by a shift in pH. A panning experiment generally includes several iterative rounds of binding-washing-elution steps. In between rounds, the sub-library of phage particles is again propagated within bacteria. Individual phage clones are then randomly selected and screened in a monoclonal phage assay, usually an ELISA. Any clones that display binding are then subjected to Sanger sequencing of the individual peptide genes. Peptide phage display has most often been applied to the epitope mapping of monoclonal antibodies 5 and can be used to reveal epitopes recognised by disease-specific monoclonal antibodies, which can then be used to develop serological assays to detect infection. Conventional phage display techniques have also been applied to mapping the immunodominant epitopes of polyclonal sera. One of the most comprehensive examples of this evaluated responses in chickens immunised with the ectoparasite Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus 6 . This study revealed eight consensus motifs. Other examples include the identification of 4 immunodominant epitopes within ricin following immunisation of rabbits 7 and the identification seven peptides recognised during infection with Mycobacterium leprae 8 . Bachler and co-workers also applied phage display panning of a random peptide library to map the polyclonal antibody response to a multicomponent HIV vaccine and compared the epitopes recognised by antibodies from protected individuals to those without protection. They succeeded in mapping a neutralising epitope to a region within one of the vaccine peptides 9 . In an alternative phage display approach, the genome of Salmonella Typhimurium was displayed on",

            "text": "The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) classifies several bacterial toxins and/or the pathogens producing these toxins as category A or B agent as they are a high risk to national security and public health (see: https://www.niaid.nih.gov/ research/emerging-infectious-diseases-pathogens). Thus, these toxins are a relevant target for development of diagnostics and therapeutics (Froude et al., 2011). Here, antibody phage display technology is a powerful tool to select diagnostic as well as neutralizing antibodies against complete active toxins or certain domains by using human na\u00efve antibody libraries with high diversity (Indrawattana et al., 2010;Amaro et al., 2011;Neri et al., 2011). The aim of such neutralizing antibodies is in most cases to block the interaction of the toxin to its cellular target, by binding to the cell binding domain of the toxin. However, neutralization of the toxicity is also possible by antibodies directed against other domains like the translocation domain or the enzymatic domain (F\u00fchner et al., 2018;Wenzel et al., 2020a). Immunization of animals with toxoids, non-toxic subunits or selected toxin domains allows for the isolation of high-affinity antibodies with immune antibody libraries. \n\nEspecially well-suited for the construction of such immune antibody libraries are macaques as there V-genes are very similar to their human counterparts (Chassagne et al., 2004;Pelat et al., 2007;Pelat et al., 2009;R\u00fclker et al., 2012;Miethe et al., 2014;Miethe et al., 2015). Alternatively, also B-cells from vaccinated humans can be used in cases where an approved vaccine is available (Wenzel et al., 2020a).",

            "text": "Murine 1 (2A10G6) [67] Fusion Loop is based on the fusion of B lymphocytes with myeloma cells to generate hybrid cells that continuously produce antibodies in vitro [82]. However, the steps for producing hybrid cells are laborious and dependent on immune response induction. Alternatively, techniques involving isolation of infected plasmoblasts or memory B cells from infected individuals have been widely employed. The great advantage of these methodologies is the isolation of antibodies from donors who carry antibodies derived from cells that were activated naturally, allowing for full exploration of the strength of the human antibody response to a pathogen [83]. The MAb developed by Balmaseda et al. [74] is derived from a panel of MAbs produced by immortalization of memory B cells using Epstein-Barr virus from four infected ZIKV donors of the recent epidemic. Robbiani et al. [73] and Sapparapu et al. [71] also isolated MAbs by expanding memory B cell clones from ZIKV-infected individuals. Prior characterization of these clones was performed based on their ability to bind viral proteins, such as NS1 and E, and their ability to neutralize ZIKV infection. \n\nIn addition to the methodologies for MAb obtention, phage display has emerged as one of the main alternatives for the generation of human recombinant MAbs. Phage display enables to select human MAbs without in vivo immunization through the selection of combinatorial libraries of human antibodies displayed on filamentous phage surfaces against a target antigen, allowing for rapid and economical MAbs generation [84]. The phage display biopanning process mimics B cell clonal selection of the immune system by enriching phage particles that express antibodies with a desired specificity [85]. Therefore, the technique is highly robust due to the high stability of the phages, allows for the control of biochemical parameters throughout the selection process, and can shape the specificity profile of an antibody from the beginning. Wu et al. [75] identified a panel of human MAbs with high affinity and specificity for ZIKV DIII from a phage display na\u00efve antibody library. \n\nPhage display is also considered an important tool for mapping the epitopes of monoclonal antibodies.",

In addition, their effectiveness against all classes of pathogens, low toxicity and minimal severe or long-term side effect make them ideal as prophylactic or therapeutics drugs that have to be rushed into use (Casadevall et al., 2004). \n\nHowever, while traditional hybridoma techniques isolate clones that secrete full-length immunoglobulins, the initial phage library screen typically utilizes bacterially expressed clones that are in the scFv or Fab format. Therefore for functional use as an antibody, the clone must be transferred to an appropriate vector for expression of recombinant fulllength immunoglobulin in eukaryotic cell culture (Kohler and Milstein, 1975;Jostock et al., 2004). However, some antibody clones may fail to express properly or lose affinity during this conversion from a bacterial to a eukaryotic expression system, as well as a change of antibody structural format. This may be caused by the presence of amber stops within coding sequences generated from random synthetic nucleotide sequences (Marcus et al., 2006), or improper folding. This is a particular problem for synthetic libraries as they have not undergone positive selection within the immune system to remove antibodies that are unable to express or fold properly, unlike libraries generated from natural repertoires. On the other hand, synthetic libraries may have advantages over natural ones in that they possess non-natural sequences that may code for antibodies with unusual specificities that are not present in natural repertoires (Griffiths et al., 1994). \n\nPoor conversion of the isolated antibody fragment-phage clones to a soluble antibody format impairs the suitability of phage display as a method for the rapid generation of antibodies.",

Also, fd phage-displayed peptide epitopes from the V3 loop of the surface glycoprotein gp120 [72], reverse transcriptase of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [73], and glycoprotein G of the human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [74] have been capable of inducing the production of high titers of pathogen-specific antibodies and conferring resistance to the infectious agent on vaccinated animals. Taken together, these observations provide strong support for the notion that peptide epitopes displayed on the surface of phage particles represent huge potential to be used as efficient means for focusing the antibody response to the pathogen-derived epitopes and triggering a potent pathogen-specific humoral response.",

            "text": "In addition, the phage display can simplify the cloning process and acquire a large amount of material to produce peptides or proteins because of the small size of the phage genome and high efficiency of the phage infection (67,68). \n\nThe phage display offers the direct physical link between a protein and its genetic material, which helps people to effectively screen the desired cloning again and again, and then amplify it (67). In the process of library screening, specific phage clones are enriched continuously due to their specific affinity for ligands, and relatively rare clones that can bind ligands can be quickly and effectively screened out from a large library (58). Therefore, the biggest advantage of phage display is that once the phage library is established, specific antibodies against the target antigen can be directly screened from the library according to the needs within 23 weeks, which greatly reduces the preparation cycle of mAbs (61). In addition, by specific construction, the filamentous phage may act as a vector, and generate a peptide library of phage display that contains hundreds of millions of unique peptides, which are conducive to their application in antiviral research (69). However, due to the different binding properties of antibodies in bacteria and eukaryotic cells, the applicability of the technology is limited to a certain extent (70). The processes of the phage display refer to bacterial transformation, phage packaging, and even transmembrane secretion processes, which limit the capacity of the phage display library and their molecular diversity. At present, the capacity of the phage display library is usually 10 11 (27). Also, limited by the expression system, the antibody library is not large enough to support the acquisition of some rare antibodies and not all sequences are well expressed in phages, because the realisation of some protein functions acquire folding, transportation, membrane insertion and complexation, resulting in the need for additional selection pressure during in vivo screening (45). It is difficult to obtain antibodies that inhibit the growth or function of phages or the expression host, as the phage display system depends on the expression of intracellular genes, which may make the diversity of the library decrease rapidly (71).",

They established scFv by enzymatic assembly of VL and VH structural domains using synergistic action of \u03bb-exonuclease and Bst DNA polymerase. In contrast, Yang et al. (2009) used a \u03b2-lactamase selection strategy to enlarge the functional variety of the libraries. They fused the installation of scFv genes sequence to the 5\u2032 end of the \u03b2-lactamase genes and performed scFv cloning by penicillin choice. Sblattero & Bradbury (1998) adopted the Cre recombinase method, which the vector comprises two non-homologous Loxp sites, to build the large capacity human derived natural antibody libraries. The Cre-Loxp system was adopted to amplify the variety of the library. \n\nIn 1990, McCafferty et al. (1990) ) constructed an antibody library with a library capacity of 106 and successfully screened lysozyme scFvs from it. Phage display technology became an emerging means of antibody preparation in antibody engineering (McCafferty et al., 1990). The scFv gene was displayed on the surface of the phage through phage infection, which was screened from the phage display single chain antibody libraries using specific antigens. The final antigen enrichment was achieved after several rounds of screening (Baca et al., 1997). ELISA assayed the binding activity of the screened phage with the target molecule, and scFv was obtained after DNA sequencing. Currently, phage display single chain antibody libraries technology had an indispensable role in vaccine development and tumor therapy. We described the advantages of screening scFv using phage display technology and summarized the differences between T4, T7, \u03bb and M13 phages. We also discussed the use of solid phase and liquid phase screening for scFv and phage antibody libraries applications.",

            "text": "Antibodies are the most preferred tools and are widely used for disease diagnostics and therapy. There is an increasing need for more stable and specific antibodies in the medical and diagnostic fields [37][38]. However, conventional hybridoma monoclonal antibody technology is laborious, expensive, time-consuming and has difficulty keeping up with the current pace of recognition of targeted antigen structures. The use of antibody phage display on a llama non-immune library provides a reliable, cost-effective and fast option for generating VHH antibodies. Non-immune libraries have many advantages in that the time-consuming immunization and library construction protocols can be omitted for each new target [39]. VHH antibodies are being researched for multiple pharmaceutical applications and have potential for use in the treatment of some diseases [40][41][42]. This is the first study that has successfully developed a reliable and controllable protocol for nanobody screening against DENV2-rNS1 protein from a nonimmune llama VHH library followed by the expression of the nanobodies by E. coli (BL21). \n\nAfter purification, sequence alignment of the VHH antibodies by the IMGT system revealed some sequence homology of the framework regions and residues within the two complementarity determining regions (CDR1, CDR2) with Lama glama (IGHV1S3*01, IGHJ4*01). However, the CDR3 regions, previously known to represent a highly antigenic recognition core, were different and did not show homology with the other sequences. Based on these findings, the high affinity of VHH antibodies might be due to these novel and longer CDR3 regions while other CDRs and some contact residues of the framework region may bind opportunistically with the antigen [31][32]. \n\nThe fast, user-friendly and cost-effective immunochromatographic assay, which is based on rapid diagnostic kits for NS1 detection in patient's serum, provides opportunities for point-ofcare diagnosis, especially in developing countries [13,43]. The selection of well characterized antibodies is crucial for the development of biosensors based on immunoassay. Currently, the frequency of dengue infection has increased because of warmer weather conditions and frequent international travel.",

            "text": "This can also be achieved by Ag immobilization on the transducer surface. Various assays have been developed for different transducer based immunosensor using polyclonal, monoclonal and scFv antibodies against different hapten molecules e.g. heroin, morphine, monoacetyl morphine (MAM), morphine-3-glucuronide (M 3 G). Fig. 2 shows the immunosensor development by various methods such as polyclonal, monoclonal and single chain fragment variable antibodies (scFv). Polyclonal antibodies have greater advantage where we can have large pool of antibodies in its native conformation, therefore, are more stable due to presence of heavy chain in the constant region. Besides polyclonal antibodies, monoclonal Abs (mAbs) of desired affinities can also be screened. Hybridoma technique also serves an attractive alternate, where mAbs can be synthesized in unlimited quantity with consistent characteristics. In line up with the above statement, phage display technology is now widely used in making recombinant antibodies for clinical, therapeutic and diagnostic applications. The major advantage of phage display in comparison with the available hybridoma technology based methods is the specificity of the scFv/Fab fragments towards a specific antigen that can be generated in a short span of time, isolation and production is cheaper than monoclonal antibodies, animal immunization, sacrification and bleeding can be avoided. Therefore, the proposed approaches can be used as powerful tool to develop immunosensor to explore the possibilities in diagnostic applications.",

            "text": "Over the last two decades, in vitro selection technologies have matured as effective alternatives to animal immunization for the isolation of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Since the first description that antibody fragments can be expressed on the surface of filamentous bacteriophage and selected for specific binding to a target, phage display has become one of the most widely used in vitro approaches for the generation of antibodies for research and therapeutic applications [1,2]. More recently, the display of antibodies at the surface of yeast or mammalian cells, as well as cell free systems, such as ribosome display, have complemented the panel of technologies available for the isolation and engineering of antibodies and other protein scaffolds [3,4]. Regardless of the display package used for in vitro isolation of antibodies, a collection of diversified genes encoding antibody variable regions has to be generated. The diversity and quality of such an antibody gene library is of critical importance for success and the correlation between the number and affinity of antibodies that can be isolated and the library size has been demonstrated [5]. Thus, there has been significant effort to assemble very large antibody libraries, i.e., comprising between 10 8 and >10 11 members, so that, in principle, antibodies against any antigen can be identified [6][7][8]. \n\nAntibody libraries can be constructed either by capturing naturally rearranged immunoglobulin genes isolated from B cells or using synthetic approaches relying on mutagenesis of the complementarity determining regions (CDR) of the antibody. In addition, semi-synthetic strategies that combine both naturally occurring and synthetic sequences have also been described [9]. In most cases, na\u00efve libraries are built as universal or 'single pot' source of antibodies against any antigen. However, tailor made libraries for defined purposes have also been described. These include libraries incorporating antibody variable genes derived from immunized animals or humans that had been exposed to pathogens or vaccines, thus creating a bias towards the antigen used for immunization or the pathogen [10,11]. In these cases, the frequency and affinity of specific antibodies retrieved from relatively small libraries are usually much higher.",

Phage display technology provides a powerful support for early diagnosis, targeted drug delivery, and precision medicine in the asymptomatic stage of pancreatic cancer. Although the application of phage display technology in cancer and oncology has been widely reported (Qu et al., 2017;Li et al., 2020) and some phage display-derived peptides or antibodies for cancer therapy have received FDA approval (Lu et al., 2020;Passariello et al., 2020), the use of phage display-derived peptides in pancreatic cancer has been relatively limited. \n\nThis paper is a review of the application of phage display technology in pancreatic cancer research. Phage display is a powerful tool for drug discovery and biomarker imaging, which offers advantages in early detection, targeted drug delivery, and precision medicine for pancreatic cancer. Phage display technology has demonstrated its value as a reliable drug discovery platform, as evidenced by the FDA approval of several anti-cancer drugs derived from phage display, such as avelumab and moxetumomab pasudodox. The article highlights the importance of ongoing investigations using phage display technology in order to make key discoveries for new treatments for pancreatic cancer. The use of phage display technology offers new tools and insights that could ultimately provide hope for pancreatic cancer patients.",

            "text": "Phage display is a powerful tool for target ligand selection owing to its being simple, highly effective, rapid, and cheap. Efficient biopanning selection leads to the isolation of ligands with unique, specific, and desired functional characteristics. Phage antibody display offers multiple platforms for the use of antigen-binding; however, the diversity and stability of the library still need to be improved. \n\nIn the past few years, the need for highly sensitive bioanalytical methods to diagnose and monitor socially significant diseases has increased. This is due, on the one hand, to the growth of the disease in general, including the unprecedented spread of the new coronavirus infection, SARS-CoV-2, and, on the other hand, to the need to overcome the limitations of current biomedical diagnostic methods. For example, because of puncture invasiveness, a tissue biopsy cannot always be performed, and the results of a single biopsy often cannot provide sufficient information in real-time to diagnose the disease. PCR is currently one of the most popular tools for the rapid detection of viral infections. Nucleic acid-based virus detection usually provides high sensitivity but may require trained personnel and be time-consuming and expensive. The use of isothermal amplification systems may reduce equipment costs, making these systems indispensable when highperformance and rapid cycling testing are required. Alternatives to PCR are immunoassays, which offer reliability and cost-effectiveness. In addition, some immunoassays can be modified with lateral flow technology, which greatly speeds up the generation of results. However, immunoassays are usually inferior in sensitivity to PCR. Along with these methods, the use of next-generation sequencing can provide promising results. In addition, the ability to sequence a large number of viral genomes will provide researchers with expanded information about them and will help in tracing infections. \n\nCharacteristics such as high throughput, ease of use, and short running time play an important part, especially in viral outbreaks, in addition to the general requirement for the accuracy, validity, and specificity of viral assays. This strategy enables simple, cheap, rapid, and sensitive detection of specific pathogens, which shows great potential in virus analysis in situ.",

            "text": "Since a large number of infectious diseases are caused by pathogenic bacterial strains, it is obvious that such strains should be specifically detected during diagnostic procedures. Different approaches are used to obtain satisfactory results. The platform used for detection often depends on the kind of molecular target in the pathogen that has been chosen. When nucleic acids are used, a precise detection of bacteria is possible, but the main disadvantage of this method is the requirement for the isolation and purification of target molecules prior to their detection. This may be a time-consuming step, which makes the whole assay relatively long and expensive [1]. \n\nAnother approach is to recognize antigens on the surface of detected bacteria by using specific antibodies. This approach does not need any time-consuming initial preparation of the sample; however, antibodies are quite costly and cumbersome in preparation. Their performance, especially affinity and avidity, strongly affects the assay sensitivity. Moreover, an additional drawback is their limited shelf life, which limits the viability of ready-to-use antibody-based sensors [2]. \n\nRecently, it was demonstrated that antibodies can be replaced with bacteriophages in assays devoted to detecting bacteria [3,4]. These viruses offer many advantages over standard antibodies in detection procedures, namely, phage proteins engaged in host recognition are extremely stable, phages are easy to isolate and propagate, and they can be stored for a relatively long time. These features make bacteriophages a cheap and fully functional tool that can replace primary antibodies in procedures of immunological detection of bacteria [5,6]. \n\nBacteriophages have already been widely used for the identification of bacteria in phage typing tests [7][8][9][10]. In these assays, one can employ the relatively narrow host range of some phages, which is limited to one or several strains. When multiple phages with partially overlapping host ranges are used, the ability of the tested bacterial strain to support the growth of some of phages from the collection can be considered as a kind of a fingerprint, allowing for easy and inexpensive strain identification. However, classical phage typing is useful to distinguish bacterial strains, but not to detect them in a clinical or environmental sample.",

            "text": "Recently, phage display technology has been used widely to produce highly specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in a short time, without animal use [13]. Based on antigen binding sites, the Ab fragments, such as the fragment of antigen binding (Fab), and single-chain variable fragments (scFv) have been constructed in the format of phage display libraries [14]. Moreover, the human heavy chain variable domain (VH), retaining antigen binding ability, has been developed [15]. With a molecular weight of around 15 kDa, VH Abs have many advantages over intact and large Ab fragments, such as a higher tissue penetration and the ability to target cryptic epitopes [16]. Because of their small size, VH Abs allow for easy large-scale production in a bacterial expression system [17]. For these reasons, VH Ab production based on phage display represents an alternative technology for the generation of diagnostic antibodies. \n\nThis study aimed to apply the phage display technology to produce mAbs specific to S. suis serotype 2 that could be used for discrimination between serotypes 2 and 1/2. The VH Abs were selected from the human VH antibody library. Biopanning against whole cells of S. suis serotype 2 was employed to enrich Ab binding to bacterial CPS. The binding ability and crossreactivity of the selected VH Ab were tested using ELISA, while its bioactivity was also explored using the quellung reaction.",

Thiolation of phages decorated with receptor-binding proteins intended to target various bacterial pathogens allows for the binding of AuNPs. This attachment results in the formation of aggregates on the Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology frontiersin.org phage surface. When exposed to pathogens, a color change was observed due to the aggregation of AuNPs. Furthermore, this assay can selectively detect bacterial species without any cross-reactivity while maintaining a low detection limit comparable to that of other assays (Miranda et al., 2011;Wang et al., 2015). It also demonstrates consistent performance across different media types, including tap water, seawater, and human serum, thus making it suitable for various environmental conditions. In another study, researchers utilized a combination of magnetic nanoparticles and complexes formed by M13 phages and AuNPs for the visual quantification of the avian influenza virus (AIV) (Xu et al., 2021). They modified AuNPs with both antiphage and anti-AIV antibodies that were then bound to M13 phages, thus resulting in the formation of a phage-AuNP complex. Both probes, the phage-AuNP complex, and the modified magnetic nanoparticles simultaneously recognized the pathogen and formed relatively large complex particles compared to the individual gold and magnetic nanoparticles. By creating eye-visible and bright millimeter-sized plaques of these sandwich complexes on a plate, AIV can be directly detected at a sensitivity similar to that of digital polymerase chain reaction (dPCR) (Xu et al., 2021).",

The detection of testosterone is of paramount importance for diagnostic purposes in clinical settings, as well as for monitoring athletes\u2019 physiological parameters and ensuring the integrity of sports competitions. Methods Herein, we present a phage display-derived biosensing platform through genetic engineering of the TS77 antibody variable domains. The variable region genes of the heavy and light chains from TS77 antibody were cloned into the pDong1 plasmid and displayed on the phage surfaces through phage display technology. Subsequently, a novel non-competitive open-sandwich ELISA (OS-ELISA) was developed for testosterone detection, leveraging the antigen-induced interaction changes in antibody variable regions. Results OS-ELISA based on anti L-chain antibody achieved a limit of detection (LOD) of 2.71 nM and a half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 0.22 \u03bcM for testosterone detection. Furthermore, the enhanced OS-ELISA platform incorporating purified maltose binding protein fused with VL (MBP-VL) and VH phage demonstrated a LOD of 1.07 pM and a wide working range from 1 pM to 10 mM. Discussion The OS-ELISA developed in this study exhibits high sensitivity and a broad dynamic range for testosterone quantification, showing significant potential for clinical diagnostics and athlete monitoring applications.",

            "text": "Bacteriophages, also known as phages, are ubiquitous viruses that infect bacteria and archaea. Like their eukaryote relatives, phages can consist of either double-stranded or single-stranded DNA or RNA genomes. This diversity of phages can be seen in both their morphology and genome architecture, with genome size that ranges from ~3-500 kb. First described independently in 1915 by Frederick Twort and in 1917 by Felix d'Herelle, we now know phages are the most abundant taxon in the biosphere with an estimated 10 31 viral particles. Since their discovery, phages have had an enormous impact on our understanding of genetics, molecular biology, bacterial evolution, and marine and soil ecology. Furthermore, the study of bacterial defenses against phages have led to powerful scientific tools including restriction enzymes and the revolutionary gene editing tools of the CRISPR-Cas system. The discovery of restriction enzyme system was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology/Medicine in 1978 and in 2020, CRISPR-Cas-based gene editing application was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. \n\nPhages were the first to have their entire genomes sequenced and, indeed, the use of phage derived products such as T7 DNA polymerase, T4 DNA ligase, M13 vectors were critical in whole genome sequencing projects from phages to humans. Phages themselves have played an immense role in developing tools and methods for pathogen detection and identification. From the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) gold standard for \"phage typing\" bacterial isolates to the development of the phage display system for discovery of binding peptides and antibodies, researchers have found creative ways to exploit phages for novel pathogen detection platforms. There are many reviews on the use of phages for pathogen detection using different assays, platforms and biosensors [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9]. This review will focus on how phages have been exploited for detection of those pathogens that are of most concern due to their history and potential for use as biowarfare and bioterrorism agents.",

A panel of recombinant antibodies was selected, which distinguish a Two different phage display selection methods were used, one by depletion of the library from non-tuberculosis lysates, and another by using a partially purified protein preparation. The depletion method aimed to select highly specific M. tuberculosis VHH antibody fragments against potentially a very wide range of antigens from the lysate, whereas the direct panning method aimed to select VHH antibody fragments specific for the three dominant proteins in the sample. We expected a large sequence variety, and indeed, a broad spectrum of 68 unique sequences was obtained. Out of which six sequences were found to be the same from both selection methods, suggesting that both procedures overlapped in their selectivity for an epitope. Investigations by ELISA with a range of different mycobacteria revealed that the selected llama antibody fragments allowed specific detection of all tested tuberculosis-causing species, and distinguish them from noninfectious mycobacteria such as M. kansasii, M. avium and M. smegmatis and other respiratory pathogens such as S. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae (Fig. 3B). Apparently, both selection methods lead to antibodies that specifically recognize the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. \n\nEarlier, selection of several mouse single-chain fragments (scFvs) reactive with M. tuberculosis culture proteins by phage display was reported [23], and very recently also chicken scFv antibodies for 16 kDa hsp [24]. In the present work, VHH was preferred over scFv, because scFvs are larger, and often suffer from poor stability, unless genetically engineered [25,26], while VHHs often display high stability over long periods of exposure to ambient temperature [10], which allowed for extensive re-use of the SPR chip. \n\nSurprisingly, Western blot analysis showed that all 12 tested VHHs from different clusters bind to the species-specific 16 kDa hsp (Fig. 4B), despite the high sequence diversity among the clusters (Fig. 2).",

Epitope mapping of MAbs to a panel of site mutations and truncations of SFTSV N protein tested by IFA assay. immunogenicity of SFTSV N protein as well as other 3 antigenic sites were finally defined. As a newly emerged viral pathogen, successful control of SFTSV epidemic requires a better understanding of antigen targets in humoral immune responses to the infection. Results in this paper presented that intensive antibodies were reactive to the N protein, but less antibodies to viral glycoprotein, which is believed to be major neutralizing antibody inducer. In general, all virus infection should induce neutralizing antibodies, as for bunyavirus infection, it has been largely evidenced that almost all of neutralizing polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies are viral glycoprotein Gn or Gc specific [19,20], but not for N protein specific antibodies, even the antibodies to some strong immunogenic N protein epitopes had no neutralizing activity [5,21]. The large numbers of human antibodies derived from SFTS patient antibody phage display library finally turn out to the N protein, it is possible that the abundant amount and high immunogenicity of the N protein produced large amount of antibodies with high binding affinity to N protein distract the selection of neutralizing antibodies to glycoprotein in the phage panning process, as for other Bunyavidridae such as RVFV and Puumala virus, it has been reported that the reaction between antibody and glycoprotein involves conformational epitopes that are more fragile [5,22,23]. In addition, the SFTS virions we used for antibody library screening might not be sufficiently native in the process of phage panning. The undergoing effort for purifying native glycoprotein would facilitate identifying MAbs against glycoprotein.",

            "text": "An alternative to the use of traditional immunization to generate antibodies has been the use of in vitro display methods [37] to select antibodies from large na\u00efve or immune libraries. In these techniques, large antibody libraries in either the Fab or single chain Fv (scFv) format [38] are displayed on the surface of filamentous phage [39,40] or yeast [41,42], and antibodies binding targets of interest are purified away from the multitude of non-binding antibodies. Targets are usually immobilized and the binding antibodies separated from non-binding antibodies by a series of washing steps, followed by elution. The selection of antibodies from vast antibody libraries, instead of using animal immunization and hybridoma technology, offers the advantage of guiding the selection process towards antibodies with rare specificities, epitopes or characteristics that are extremely difficult to find with animal-based methods. The key feature of in vitro display systems is that phenotype (the displayed antibody) and genotype (the gene encoding the displayed antibody) are coupled in such a way that selection of an antibody on the basis of its binding activity leads to simultaneous selection of the gene that encodes it. This guarantees the permanent availability of selected clones over time, by virtue of gene synthesis, and also makes it possible to express clones in different antibody formats (e.g., with Fc domains from different species), as well as improve antibody properties, such as affinity. Furthermore, recombinantly expressed antibodies have been shown to be more specific than their hybridoma expressed counterparts, which often express additional immunoglobulin chains that detract from their specificity [43]. \n\nIn general, the larger the library, the higher the affinity of antibodies that can be selected, although this tends to be target specific, with protein targets generally yielding much higher affinities than small targets such as mycolactone. We developed a recombinatorial method [44,45] to create particularly large phage antibody libraries, from which human antibodies against a number of challenging targets have been generated [46][47][48]. Here we describe the application of this approach to select human antibodies recognizing mycolactone.",

            "text": "Recent progress in antibody engineering have been directed toward the expression of antibody fragments in bacterial and phage display systems, leading to increase of various applications in biology, clinical diagnosis and therapy.The power of the phage display system to express antibody fragments offers several advantages over hybridoma technology, allowing quick, economical production and generation of antibodies with increasing affinity and specificity by mimicking affinity maturation in the normal immune system, and offering the antibody a stable genetic source which can be easily manipulated [39][40][41][42][43][44][45][46][47][48][49][50][51] . Antibody fragments showed less possibility of developing anti-antibody response in comparison to the intact antibodies when applied in vivo. \n\nIn this study, the ScFv of murine McAb MC3 directed against colorectal and gastric carcinomas was successfully produced by advanced phage antibody technology, which offered it the above advantages of the engineering antibody. MC3 ScFv was displayed on the surface of M13 phage as a fusion protein with gene protein (g3p) and additionally expressed in a soluble form secreted in the bacterial periplasm. Both expression forms retained their reactivity to the antigen. Because of the advantage of MC3 ScFv compared to the intact MC3 for in vivo diagnosis and therapy of the associated carcinomas, we have focused on the production of soluble ScFv. \n\nA critical step in cloning of the ScFv DNA was the assembly of VH and VL DNAs with linker DNA. The linker primers consist of two 93-base oligonucleotides which are complementary to each other and have homology with the 3'end of the VH gene and the 5'end of the VL gene. 24 bases on either end of the linkers are complementary to the ends of the VH and the VL. The central 45 bases of the linkers encode the flexible (Gly\u00aa-4Ser)\u00aa-3 linker which joins the VH and the VL to form a ScFv fragment. In the assembly and fill-in reactions, an exact quantification of purified VH and VL products and linker DNA was very essential.",

            "text": "By using the inherent selection potential of antibody phage display, murine scFv capable of recognizing the avian influenza virus (AIV) was isolated and evaluated through ELISA. It showed higher sensitivity and specificity as compared to the previously established protocols [35]. An antibody repertoire of llamas immunized with purified nucleoprotein (AIV-NP) of AIV yielded a novel nanobody (VHH). This VHH led to the development of a lateral flow assay for the rapid detection of AIV [36]. Mining of the rabbit antibody repertoire through antibody phage display yielded a novel scFv capable of targeting a conserved motif in the C-terminal of the F2 protein of Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV). This scFv has exceptional diagnostic applications, ensuring rapid pathotyping of NDV isolates [37]. Chicken antibody repertoire has also been explored with phage display for the screening of scFv against phosphoprotein (NDV-P) of NDV. This protein is involved in viral RNA replication and transcription, thus presents itself as a potential diagnostic target in control of NDV. An isolated scFv showed higher specificity for NDV-P by ELISA and Western blot [38]. Another important virus causing considerable economic losses to the poultry industry is the infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV). Due to a variety of IBDV strains, it was always difficult to distinguish between very virulent IBDV (vvIBDV), classical, variant, and vaccine strains. Sapats and colleagues (2006) isolated a single-chain variable fragment, which efficiently recognizes a highly conformational epitope of VP2 protein of vvIBDV. The efficacy of this mAb in distinguishing vvIBDV from other strains makes it ideal for diagnostic tests like ELISA [39,40]. Besides chicken, duck has also become a significant part of the worldwide poultry industry. One of the biggest challenges faced by this industry is duck viral hepatitis (DVH) caused by duck hepatitis A virus (DHAV). It is characterized into three serotypes, namely, DHAV-1, DHAV-2, and DHAV-3.",

            "text": "Phage display is one of the important and effective molecular biology techniques and has remained indispensable for research community since its discovery in the year 1985. As a large number of nucleotide fragments may be cloned into the phage genome, a phage library may harbour millions or sometimes billions of unique and distinctive displayed peptide ligands. The ligand\u2013receptor interactions forming the basis of phage display have been well utilized in epitope mapping and antigen presentation on the surface of bacteriophages for screening novel vaccine candidates by using affinity selection-based strategy called biopanning. This versatile technique has been modified tremendously over last three decades, leading to generation of different platforms for combinatorial peptide display. The translation of new diagnostic tools thus developed has been used in situations arising due to pathogenic microbes, including bacteria and deadly viruses, such as Zika, Ebola, Hendra, Nipah, Hanta, MERS and SARS. In the current situation of pandemic of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), a search for neutralizing antibodies is motivating the researchers to find therapeutic candidates against novel SARS-CoV-2. As phage display is an important technique for antibody selection, this review presents a concise summary of the very recent applications of phage display technique with a special reference to progress in diagnostics and therapeutics for coronavirus diseases. Hopefully, this technique can complement studies on host\u2013pathogen interactions and assist novel strategies of drug discovery for coronaviruses.",

One subset of virulence factors is staphylococcal enterotoxins, which are potent bacterial super antigens with toxic effects that directly interfere with host cells. 8 Enterotoxins are commonly known for their pyrogenic effects and interference with intestinal function; hence, they are mainly associated with staphylococcal food poisoning in humans. 70 While there are many types of staphylococcal enterotoxins, staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) induces one of the most profound toxic effects because of its ability to mount a massive host immune response, leading to a cytokine storm and subsequent acute toxic shock. 71 Effective and reliable detection methods must be carried out in identifying SEB during clinical diagnosis and food analysis. \n\nImmunological techniques, such as enzyme-linked absorbent assay (ELISA), are the most commonly used approaches; however, they are both time-consuming and inconvenient. 72 In addition, these assays use monoclonal antibody for detection in which they are of high cost and have continually become a major burden in the healthcare system. 48 lternative means to developing antibodies have recently been discovered with the use of antibodies from camelids. These types of antibodies are capable of antigen binding despite not having any light chains. 73 onsequently, they are mostly known as a nanobody or camelid heavy chain antibody (VHH). VHH may render the use of traditional monoclonal antibodies obsolete as VHH has become more profound in numerous medical applications. To investigate its purpose with SEB, an SEB-specific and sensitive camelid nanobody was produced using phage display. 48 Two phage clones were found to have the highest affinity to SEB with one of them demonstrating a high specificity of 10 \u22129 M. Phage display technology on its own provides an ideal pathway for detecting SEB with the screening of peptides that may prove to be highly SEB-specific.",

The additional advantages of PAD (a relative short time to produce the reagent, a relatively inexpensive technology compared to the alternatives and, importantly, the removal of the need to use animals) serve only to emphasise the enormous attraction of this approach. \n\nIn conclusion, it seems that phage antibody display holds enormous promise of being a technology which can address many of the most desirable but frustratingly elusive goals of clinical, i.e. diagnostic, microbiology. As is the custom of clinical microbiologists, it is to be expected that PAD will be enlisted in their neverdiminishing effort to diagnose the infectious illnesses of human beings more quickly, more cheaply and more accurately.",

It contains only the Fv portion (V L and V H ) of the antibody molecule [14] and offers more advantages than just being easy to produce in E. coli. By employing phage display technology, it is possible to isolate a scFv virtually against any protein.

It is a high-throughput method that is extremely efficient for isolation of highly specific monoclonal antibodies for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes.

            "text": "Data presented here indicate that the combined use of genespecific libraries and deep sequencing, as exemplified by the PROFILER technology, can significantly empower phage display-based epitope mapping methods and usefully complement the results of more sophisticated techniques, such as HDX-MS. In this respect, our results are in general agreement with those obtained with other methods based on next-generation sequencing of surface-displayed libraries, including phage, 18,19 yeast, 20 or ribosome 21 display. S1. Our previous experience has indicated that lambda phage systems, such as the one employed in the PROFILER technology, can be used to efficiently display fragments of a wider variety of antigens compared with the more commonly used filamentous phage display systems. 12,13,22 Since filamentous phage assembly occurs at or within the membrane of Escherichia coli, residues inhibiting proper protein insertion into this membrane may block the assembly and extrusion of phage particles, thereby preventing the display of the corresponding proteins. On the other hand, the capsid of lytic bacteriophages, such as lambda, is assembled in the cytoplasm of bacteria, and the display of fusion proteins does not depend on their ability to translocate across the membrane. Moreover, lambda phages also show an increased ability, over filamentous phages, to display proteins or peptides that may be toxic to the cell. 23 Nevertheless, since any display system has drawbacks, in addition to advantages, it cannot be excluded from our data that some proteins might be less efficiently displayed on lambda phages than the NadA antigen used in this study. \n\nThe selection conditions (including the number of selection rounds) utilized here were chosen to provide the most informative phage pools in terms of their complexity and sequence variability. This, in conjunction with the ability of PROFILER to analyze thousands of different fragments for their degree of antibody-mediated enrichment, allowed the identification of a wider variety of affinity-selected polypeptides, compared with conventional techniques. For example, traditional immunoscreening was unable to identify the shorter and less immunoreactive fragments contained in the affinity-selected library. These shorter sequences are often useful in epitope mapping to identify structures that are still sufficient for antibody binding.",

The advantage of using recombinant F1 as a selection target rather than the entire organism is the reduced likelihood of developing antibodies against components of the cell surface that are not associated to pathogenicity. In an attempt to find scFv specifically recognizing F1 antigen we have panned a large phage display library against recombinant F1. In this report we describe selection of a set of seven different aF1 scFv together with their rapid screening and assay for binding specificity by multiplex flow cytometry and onestep ELISA. More importantly we describe phage-based assays in which filamentous phage displaying our selected aF1 scFvs prepared using a helper cell-based method previously described [9] are successfully used as ''large antibodies'' instead of the soluble scFvs. Phage-scFvs have a number of advantages over the use of free scFvs, including stability, ease of purification and labeling. Furthermore even our weakest aF1 scFv shows binding specificity in a phage display format. Therefore we believe that the use of phage-displayed scFv may be generally applicable to a vast array of scFv, overcoming the typical shortcomings of these antibody fragments and avoiding the need for subcloning.",

            "text": "Background The urgent need for affordable and rapid detection methodologies for foodborne pathogens, particularly Escherichia coli (E. coli), highlights the importance of developing efficient and widely accessible diagnostic systems. Dark field microscopy, although effective, requires specific isolation of the target bacteria which can be hindered by the high cost of producing specialized antibodies. Alternatively, M13 bacteriophage, which naturally targets E. coli, offers a cost-efficient option with well-established techniques for its display and modification. Nevertheless, its filamentous structure with a large length-diameter ratio contributes to nonspecific binding and low separation efficiency, posing significant challenges. Consequently, refining M13 phage methodologies and their integration with advanced microscopy techniques stands as a critical pathway to improve detection specificity and efficiency in food safety diagnostics. Methods We employed a dual-plasmid strategy to generate a truncated M13 phage (tM13). This engineered tM13 incorporates two key genetic modifications: a partial mutation at the N-terminus of pIII and biotinylation at the hydrophobic end of pVIII. These alterations enable efficient attachment of tM13 to diverse E. coli strains, facilitating rapid magnetic separation. For detection, we additionally implemented a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based algorithm for precise identification and quantification of bacterial cells using dark field microscopy. Results The results obtained from spike-in and clinical sample analyses demonstrated the accuracy, high sensitivity (with a detection limit of 10 CFU/\u03bcL), and time-saving nature (30 min) of our tM13-based immunomagnetic enrichment approach combined with AI-enabled analytics, thereby supporting its potential to facilitate the identification of diverse E. coli strains in complex samples. Conclusion The study established a rapid and accurate detection strategy for E. coli utilizing truncated M13 phages as capture probes, along with a dark field microscopy detection platform that integrates an image processing model and convolutional neural network.

Combinatorial library methods were initially applied only to peptides and oligonucleotides. By now, the scope of these libraries has expanded considerably to include proteins, synthetic oligomers, small molecules, and oligosaccharides. The enormous variety of antibodies (Abs) makes it possible to detect clones able to interact highly specifically with almost any natural or synthetic antigen (Ag). Phage Abs are an excellent alternative to mono- and polyclonal Abs, because they are highly stable, have no disulfide bonds, and are much cheaper to make. Monitoring of various substances, including proteins, in a living organism is much in demand. Despite the vast amount of literature available on Ab phage display, the use of phage display to determine diagnostically important Ags has not been sufficiently covered. Many studies have confirmed that unlike other types of Abs, phage Abs ensure highly sensitive Ag detection. Therefore, this review focuses on the use of phage display to prepare Abs specific to diagnostically important Ags (allergens, disease and cancer biomarkers, toxins) and on their application in analytical systems, including biosensors. The use of phage Abs in Ag diagnostics is compared with the use of classical Abs, and the prospects are shown for the use of phage Abs as biosensor sensing elements. This review analyzes the recent advances in the detection of diagnostically important Ags by using phage display-based biosensors. Systematic information is presented about allergens, disease and cancer biomarkers, and toxins detected by using phage Abs. Phage display Abs for sensor-based Ag detection are presented as an affordable alternative to classic tests.",

This review categorizes biosensors based on their bio-recognition elements and transducer mechanisms, focusing on key types such as electrochemical, optical, piezoelectric, and nucleic acid-based sensors. It explores specific advancements like DNA-based biosensors for molecular-level detection and antibody-based sensors for antigen specificity. Additionally, emerging technologies such as electronic noses, which detect volatile organic compounds, and phage-based biosensors, known for their high sensitivity and specificity, highlight the extensive range of biosensing applications in plant pathology.

These primers were mainly based on carabao\u2019s close relative in the Bovidae family, the cattle (Bos taurus). A total of 32 degenerate primers, 14 designed and 18 adapted from literature, were used to amplify the target antibody fragments using a high-fidelity DNA polymerase with a modified touchdown\u2013polymerase chain reaction method. Results demonstrate the amplification of VLL, VLK, and VH genes derived from B-cells of carabao splenic tissues using the degenerate primers. The amplicons will be used in the construction of an antibody phage library to elucidate the IgM repertoire of the Philippine carabao. In addition, DNA sequencing surprisingly revealed longer VLL and VLK genes than VH genes in contrast to what is found in other bovines, suggesting a novel organization of immunoglobulin genes of B. kerabau Fitzinger, 1860 that merits further investigation.",

This feature enables the M13 phage to be widely employed in the construction of scFv libraries, thereby facilitating the identification of antibodies with high specificity and affinity for target antigens. In this study, mice were immunized three times with Salmonella enteritidis (strain C50041) to induce diverse antibodies. The variable region sequences were subsequently amplified by PCR using genome extracted from the mice's splenic cells and fused to the pIII protein to construct the scFv phage display library (C50041-M13-scFv). Through biopanning with the C50041-M13-scFv library, a phage clone (C50041-scFv-4) exhibiting high affinity for the target bacteria was successfully obtained. Moreover, the scFv antibody (scFv-4) derived from C50041-scFv-4 was expressed in a prokaryotic expression system and validated to possess high specificity and affinity for C50041 through in vitro adsorption assays. Additionally, a phage-ELISA method was established: initially, bacteria were immobilized on the bottom surface of a 96-well plate. Next, the positive clone C50041-scFv-4 was introduced to specifically bind to the host cells. Finally, horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-pVIII antibodies were used to detect the pVIII proteins of the bound phage clones. Owing to the capacity of multiple C50041-scFv-4 probes to simultaneously bind to a single target Salmonella and each phage clone's ability to accommodate hundreds of HRP-labeled antibodies, the proposed phage-ELISA demonstrated remarkable sensitivity (104 CFU mL-1) for detecting Salmonella enteritidis samples. This sensitivity surpasses that of traditional ELISA by one order of magnitude in this study. Our phage-ELISA technology exhibits broad applicability across various biological species and provides an improved and robust platform for pathogen detection including bacteria and viruses.",

The rapid spread of ASF and its ongoing pandemics continue to impact pig farming worldwide. The absence of an effective vaccine, coupled with the complexity of the African swine fever virus (ASFV), makes the control and eradication of ASF a formidable challenge. Nanobodies, derived from camelids, have emerged as promising alternatives to conventional monoclonal antibodies, offering distinct advantages in various biological applications. In this study, specific nanobodies targeting the ASFV K205R protein were selected from a phage-displayed immune library. Ten individual nanobodies were isolated based on their complementary determining regions (CDRs), and four were found to bind to the naive K205R protein of ASFV. After evaluation, nanobody VHH1 was selected for the development of a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for ASFV antibody detection. The assay was optimized for various reaction conditions, and the cut-off value was determined to be 26.85%, with diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 97.52% and 97.48%, respectively. No cross-reactivity was observed with sera from pigs infected with other swine viruses, and the assay exhibited a detection sensitivity of 1:128. Comparative analysis of clinical samples showed a high concordance rate (98.98%) between the nanobody-based and monoclonal antibody-based ELISAs (Mab-cELISA). In conclusion, this study presents a phage-displayed nanobody-based competitive ELISA for the detection of ASFV antibodies, which could be valuable for ASF sero-surveillance.

Regarding the development of diagnostic antibody reagents, effective methods for the rapid preparation of specific monoclonal antibodies are inadequate. Methods In this study, a novel synthetic phage-displayed nanobody Golden Glove (SynaGG) library with a glove-like cavity configuration was established using phage display technology in synthetic biology. We applied this unique SynaGG library on the small molecule aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), which has strong hepatotoxicity, to isolate specific nanobodies with high affinity for AFB1. Result These nanobodies exhibit no cross-reactivity with the hapten methotrexate, which is recognized by the original antibody template. By binding to AFB1, two nanobodies can neutralize AFB1-induced hepatocyte growth inhibition. Using molecular docking, we found that the unique non-hypervariable complementarity-determining region 4 (CDR4) loop region of the nanobody was involved in the interaction with AFB1. Specifically, the CDR4\u2019s positively charged amino acid arginine directed the binding interaction between the nanobody and AFB1. We then rationally optimized the interaction between AFB1 and the nanobody by mutating serine at position 2 into valine. The binding affinity of the nanobody to AFB1 was effectively improved, and this result supported the use of molecular structure simulation for antibody optimization. Conclusion In summary, this study revealed that the novel SynaGG library, which was constructed through computer-aided design, can be used to isolate nanobodies that specifically bind to small molecules.

The selected mimotopes may also be directly used in phage-based ELISA immunoassays, resulting in simple, specific, sensitive, and low-cost immunodiagnostic tests (Goulart et al., 2010). Similarly, the selection of antibodies from combinatorial libraries has also become an important tool for the generation of reagents, diagnostics, and therapeutic molecules. It is the only method to obtain specific antibodies bypassing the immunization step, which mimics the maturation process of human antibody in vivo, resulting in high affinity antibody ligands, which may be suitable to human administration and potentially applicable to clinical diagnosis and treatment.",

In the present study, we report the successful antigenic and immunogenic mimicry of mannose-containing cell-wall compounds of M. tuberculosis by dodecamer peptides identified by phage-display technology. Using a rabbit antiserum raised against M. tuberculosis cell-surface saccharides as a target for biopanning, peptides with three different consensus sequences were identified. Phage-displayed and chemically synthesized peptides bound to the anticarbohydrate antiserum. Rabbit antibodies elicited against the peptide QEPLMGTVPIRAGGGS recognize the mannosylated M. tuberculosis cell-wall antigens arabinomannan and lipoarabinomannan, and the glycosylated recombinant protein alanine/proline-rich antigen. Furthermore, antibodies were also able to react with mannan from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but not with phosphatidylinositol dimannosides or arabinogalactan from mycobacteria. These results suggest that the immunogenic peptide mimics oligomannosidic epitopes. Interestingly, this report provides evidence that, in contrast with previously known carbohydrate mimotopes, no aromatic residues are necessary in a peptide sequence for mimicking unusual glycoconjugates synthesized by mycobacteria. The possible usefulness of the identified peptide mimotopes as surrogate reagents for immunodiagnosis and for the study of functional roles of the native non-peptide epitopes is discussed.",

Exploring the potential of the method, we selected mimotopes of the discontinuous, highly conformational epitope of scorpion neurotoxin Cn2, whose 3D structure is known, using its generic neutralizing monoclonal antibody BCF2. With an exhaustive selection procedure, we isolated from a 12-mer phage library a large collection of mimotopes that reproduce the antigenic and immunogenic specificity of the Cn2-epitope. The selected peptides presented three sequence motifs, the most abundant of which, RD(N)XXGF, appeared in 15 different sequence contexts displayed by 97 out of 206 clones. In the most reactive mimotope, displayed by 24 (25%) clones, the motif was flanked by two Cys residues allowing the adoption of a cyclic conformation. Motifs QL(H,M)L(M) and (S/T)WHLP were selected with less efficiency. Comparison of the motifs with the primary and three-dimensional structure of Cn2 as well as with a model of the Cn2-BCF2(Fv) complex suggests that RD(N)XXGF, which does not share sequence similarity with the epitope, mimics its central structural element, turn 7-11, by using an alternative amino acid combination nevertheless keeping the nature of its interactions with BCF2. The QL(H,M)L(M) is assumed to mimic the hydrophobic part of the epitope. The principles of the conformational mimicry by phage-displayed peptides are discussed.",

Phage display and monoclonal antibody combinatorial libraries are important sources for biomarker discovery and for improved diagnostic strategies. Mimetic peptides were selected against polyclonal antibodies from patients with dengue fever, leprosy, and leishmaniasis as model diseases, and from immunized chickens with total antigens from all three pathogens. Selected single or combined multi-epitope peptide biomarkers were further associated with four different sensor platforms, classified as affinity biosensors, that may be suitable as general protocols for field diagnosis. We have also developed two methods for nanoparticle agglutination assays (a particle gel agglutination test and a magnetic microparticle [MMP]-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]) and two electrochemical biosensors (impedimetric and amperometric) for DNA and antibody detection. For the agglutination tests, micro- and nanoparticles were coupled with filamentous bacteriophages displaying the selected mimotopes on their surfaces, which has favored the formation of the antigen-antibody or peptide-protein complexes, amplifying the optical detection in ELISA assays or after the chromatographic separation of the microagglutinates. We have also demonstrated a proof-of-concept for the electrochemical biosensors by using electrodes modified with novel functionalized polymers. These electrochemical biosensors have proven to be fast, very sensitive, and specific for the detection of pathogen DNA and circulating antibodies of patients, which may become important in a wide range of diagnostic devices for many infectious agents."

Most existing antibody repertoires are derived from human immunoglobulin genes. Genes from other species can, however, also be used. Because of the way in which gene conversion introduces diversity, the na\u00efve antibody repertoire of the chicken can easily be accessed using only two sets of primers.ResultsWith in vitro diagnostic applications in mind, we have constructed a large library of recombinant filamentous bacteriophages displaying single chain antibody fragments derived from combinatorial pairings of chicken variable heavy and light chains. Synthetically randomised complementarity determining regions are included in some of the heavy chains. Single chain antibody fragments that recognise haptens, proteins and virus particles were selected from this repertoire. Affinities of three different antibody fragments were determined using surface plasmon resonance. Two were in the low nanomolar and one in the subnanomolar range. To illustrate the practical value of antibodies from the library, phage displayed single chain fragments were incorporated into ELISAs aimed at detecting African horsesickness and bluetongue virus particles. Virus antibodies were detected in a competitive ELISA.ConclusionThe chicken-derived phage library described here is expected to be a versatile source of recombinant antibody fragments directed against a wide variety of antigens. It has the potential to provide monoclonal reagents with applications in research and diagnostics. For in vitro applications, na\u00efve phage libraries based on avian donors may prove to be useful adjuncts to the selectable antibody repertoires that already exist."

These viral entities have attracted growing interest as optimal vaccine delivery vehicles. Phages are well-matched for vaccine design due to being highly stable under harsh environmental conditions, simple and inexpensive large scale production, and potent adjuvant capacities. Phage vaccines have efficient immunostimulatory effects and present a high safety profile because these viruses have made a constant relationship with the mammalian body during a long-standing evolutionary period. The birth of phage display technology has been a turning point in the development of phage-based vaccines. Phage display vaccines are made by expressing multiple copies of an antigen on the surface of immunogenic phage particles, thereby eliciting a powerful and effective immune response. Also, the ability to produce combinatorial peptide libraries with a highly diverse pool of randomized ligands has transformed phage display into a straightforward, versatile and high throughput screening methodology for the identification of potential vaccine candidates against different diseases in particular microbial infections. These libraries can be conveniently screened through an affinity selection-based strategy called biopanning against a wide variety of targets for the selection of mimotopes with high antigenicity and immunogenicity. Also, they can be panned against the antiserum of convalescent individuals to recognize novel peptidomimetics of pathogen-related epitopes. Phage display has represented enormous promise for finding new strategies of vaccine discovery and production and current breakthroughs promise a brilliant future for the development of different phage-based vaccine platforms.",

In general, libraries are made up of either single chain Fv (scFv) or Fab fragments, and comprise billions of different clones, from which specific binders can be isolated by recursive selection cycles. One of the advantages of using phage antibody libraries is that several antibody fragments, binding to different epitopes, are usually selected, providing a greater likelihood that useful binders will be obtained."

As a large number of nucleotide fragments may be cloned into the phage genome, a phage library may harbour millions or sometimes billions of unique and distinctive displayed peptide ligands. The ligand\u2013receptor interactions forming the basis of phage display have been well utilized in epitope mapping and antigen presentation on the surface of bacteriophages for screening novel vaccine candidates by using affinity selection-based strategy called biopanning. This versatile technique has been modified tremendously over last three decades, leading to generation of different platforms for combinatorial peptide display. The translation of new diagnostic tools thus developed has been used in situations arising due to pathogenic microbes, including bacteria and deadly viruses, such as Zika, Ebola, Hendra, Nipah, Hanta, MERS and SARS. In the current situation of pandemic of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), a search for neutralizing antibodies is motivating the researchers to find therapeutic candidates against novel SARS-CoV-2. As phage display is an important technique for antibody selection, this review presents a concise summary of the very recent applications of phage display technique with a special reference to progress in diagnostics and therapeutics for coronavirus diseases. Hopefully, this technique can complement studies on host\u2013pathogen interactions and assist novel strategies of drug discovery for coronaviruses.",

Infections are a complex mechanism of interaction between pathogenic microorganisms and their host. Identification of the causative agent of the infection is vital for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. Etiological laboratory diagnostic tests are therefore essential to identify pathogens. However, due to its rapidity and automation, the serological diagnostic test is among the methods of great significance for the diagnosis of infections with the basis of detecting antigens or antibodies in body fluids clinically. Epitopes, as a special chemical group that determines the specificity of antigens and the basic unit of inducing immune responses, play an important role in the study of immune responses. Identifying the epitopes of a pathogen may contribute to the development of a vaccine to prevent disease, the diagnosis of the corresponding disease, and the determination of different stages of the disease. Moreover, both the preparation of neutralizing antibodies based on useful epitopes and the assembly of several associated epitopes can be used in the treatment of disease. Epitopes can be divided into B cell epitopes and T cell epitopes; B cell epitopes stimulate the body to produce antibodies and are therefore commonly used as targets for the design of serological diagnostic experiments. Meanwhile, epitopes can fall into two possible categories: linear and conformational. This article reviews the role of B cell epitopes in the clinical diagnosis of infectious diseases."

In this study, we used a combination of panning strategies against the hemagglutinin (HA) of several antigenic distinct H5N1 isolates to bias selection of Fab-phage from a na\u00efve human library away from the antigenic regions of HA, toward the more conserved portions of the protein. All of the identified Fab clones which showed binding to multiple antigenically distinct HA were converted to fully human IgG, and tested for their ability to neutralize the uptake of H5N1-virus like particles (VLP) into MDCK cells. Five of the antibodies which showed binding to the relatively conserved HA2 subunit of HA, exhibited neutralization of H5N1-VLP uptake in a dose dependant manner. The inhibitory effects of these five antibodies were similar to those observed with a previously described neutralizing antibody specific for the 140s antigenic loop present within HA1 and highlight the exciting possibility that these antibodies may be efficacious against multiple H5N1 strains.",

By using multiplexed flow cytometry, we can simultaneously determine the relative expression levels, the identification of nonspecific binding, and the discrimination of fine specificities to generate a complete functional profile for each clone. The quality and quantity of data, combined with significant reductions in analysis time and antigen consumption, provide notable advantages over standard ELISA methods and yield much information in the primary screen which is usually only obtained in later screens. By combining high-throughput screening capabilities with multiplex technology, we have redefined the parameters for the initial identification of affinity reagents recovered from combinatorial libraries and removed a significant bottleneck in the generation of affinity reagents on a proteomic scale.",

A straightforward approach used to determine animal contact with Ebola virus is by assessing the presence of specific antibodies in serum. This approach however has been made very difficult by the absence of specific reagents required for the detection of antibodies from the majority of wild animal species. In this study, we isolated a human monoclonal antibody Fab fragment, KZ51, that reacts with an immunodominant epitope on Ebola virus nucleoprotein (NP) that is conserved on all four Ebola virus subtypes. The antibody KZ51 represents a major specificity as sera from all convalescent patients tested (10/10) and sera from guinea pigs infected with each of the four Ebola virus subtypes competed strongly with KZ51 for binding to radiation-inactivated Ebola virus. These features allowed us to develop a novel assay for the detection of seroconversion irrespective of Ebola virus subtype or animal species. In this assay, the binding of KZ51 Fab-phage particles is used as an indicator assay and the presence of specific antibodies against Ebola virus in sera is indicated by binding competition. A prominent feature of the assay is that the Fab-phage particles may be prestained with a dye so that detection of binding can be directly determined by visual inspection. The assay is designed to be both simple and economical to enable its use in the field.",

Several species of this family are also pathogenic to humans and are recognized as potential agents of biological warfare and terrorism. The objective of this work was the generation of recombinant antibodies for the detection of VEEV after a potential bioterrorism assault or an natural outbreak of VEEV.ResultsIn this work, human anti-VEEV single chain Fragments variable (scFv) were isolated for the first time from a human na\u00efve antibody gene library using optimized selection processes. In total eleven different scFvs were identified and their immunological specificity was assessed. The specific detection of the VEEV strains TC83, H12/93 and 230 by the selected antibody fragments was proved. Active as well as formalin inactivated virus particles were recognized by the selected antibody fragments which could be also used for Western blot analysis of VEEV proteins and immunohistochemistry of VEEV infected cells. The anti-VEEV scFv phage clones did not show any cross-reactivity with Alphavirus species of the Western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV) and Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) antigenic complex, nor did they react with Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), if they were used as detection reagent.ConclusionFor the first time, this study describes the selection of antibodies against a human pathogenic virus from a human na\u00efve scFv antibody gene library using complete, active virus particles as antigen. The broad and sensitive applicability of scFv-presenting phage for the immunological detection and diagnosis of Alphavirus species was demonstrated. The selected antibody fragments will improve the fast identification of VEEV in case of a biological warfare or terroristic attack or a natural outbreak."

Unlike conventional constructs, however, each virion displays thousands of copies of the peptide in a repeating pattern, subtending a major fraction of the viral surface. The phage body serves as an interacting scaffold to constrain the peptide into a particular conformation, creating a defined organic surface structure ('landscape') that varies from one phage clone to the next. By testing landscape libraries with three representative antigens (streptavidin from the bacterium Streptomyces avidinii, avidin from chicken egg white and beta-galactosidase from Escherichia coli) we have shown that landscape phages may be used as a new type of substitute antibodies-filaments that can bind protein and glycoprotein antigens with nanomolar affinities and high specificity.

This technology has revolutionized pathogen detection by enabling faster development, better customization, and improved performance characteristics. (LLM Memory)",
                "text": "\nPhage display technology represents a significant advancement in antibody engineering that has transformed pathogen detection diagnostics. Unlike traditional antibody production methods that rely on animal immunization, phage display involves the expression of foreign peptides or proteins on the surface of bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria). This allows for the selection of specific antibody fragments with desired binding properties from large libraries. The technique works by genetically fusing antibody genes to phage coat protein genes, creating a physical link between the antibody's phenotype (binding properties) and its genotype (the encoding DNA). Through multiple rounds of selection called \"biopanning,\" scientists can isolate antibodies with high affinity and specificity for target pathogens. This technology bypasses many limitations of conventional antibody production while offering significant advantages in terms of speed, customization capabilities, and performance characteristics for diagnostic applications. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">",

(14 sources)",
                "text": "\nPhage display technology provides several key production advantages that make it superior to traditional antibody generation methods. Perhaps most significantly, phage display bypasses the need for animal immunization, aligning with EU Directive 2010/63/EU which aims to reduce, refine, and replace animal use in scientific research <Paper corpusId=\"10496834\" paperTitle=\"(McIvor et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"9420027\" paperTitle=\"(Smith, 1985)\" isShortName></Paper>. This ethical advantage is complemented by substantial economic benefits, as phage-derived antibodies are considerably less expensive to produce than traditional monoclonal antibodies <Paper corpusId=\"14579386\" paperTitle=\"(Ferrara et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"232158116\" paperTitle=\"(Anand et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe speed of antibody development represents another crucial advantage. While traditional hybridoma approaches typically require months to complete, phage display allows researchers to generate specific antibody fragments in just a few weeks <Paper corpusId=\"221092042\" paperTitle=\"(Chitray et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"6845760\" paperTitle=\"(Wyngaardt et al., 2004)\" isShortName></Paper>. This rapid development capability makes phage display particularly valuable for responding to emerging infectious disease outbreaks, such as SARS coronavirus or avian influenza, where quick diagnostic solutions are critical <Paper corpusId=\"35348531\" paperTitle=\"(Chan et al., 2011)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nFurthermore, phage display simplifies production processes. Unlike traditional monoclonal antibodies that require specialized cell culture facilities for hybridoma cell lines, recombinant antibody fragments can be propagated in bacteria such as E. coli, significantly reducing production costs <Paper corpusId=\"198254683\" paperTitle=\"(Peltomaa et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"11867879\" paperTitle=\"(Byrne et al., 2009)\" isShortName></Paper>. The technology also allows for an entirely in vitro process, eliminating the need for animal immunization and cell culture-based production systems, which streamlines manufacturing and improves scalability <Paper corpusId=\"268017705\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nPhage display offers impressive library diversity advantages as well. The technology enables the creation of libraries containing billions of different antibody clones, from which specific binders can be isolated through recursive selection cycles <Paper corpusId=\"2490199\" paperTitle=\"(Lillo et al., 2011)\" isShortName></Paper>. This approach allows researchers to \"interrogate libraries of millions to tens of billions of antibodies\" based on their specific binding properties\u2014a scale that would be \"unfathomable in traditional hybridoma work\" <Paper corpusId=\"4771464\" paperTitle=\"(Finlay et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nAn additional production benefit is the flexibility of recombinant antibodies for customization and modification. This adaptability is particularly valuable for diagnostic applications, allowing antibodies to evolve alongside advancements in sensing technologies <Paper corpusId=\"55838761\" paperTitle=\"(Ch'ng et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>. Some studies have even found that antibodies generated through phage display demonstrate greater sensitivity toward antigens compared to those produced through traditional techniques <Paper corpusId=\"270748518\" paperTitle=\"(Sadraeian et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.",

                            "BackgroundAntibody fragments selected from large combinatorial libraries have numerous applications in diagnosis and therapy. Most existing antibody repertoires are derived from human immunoglobulin genes. Genes from other species can, however, also be used. Because of the way in which gene conversion introduces diversity, the na\u00efve antibody repertoire of the chicken can easily be accessed using only two sets of primers.ResultsWith in vitro diagnostic applications in mind, we have constructed a large library of recombinant filamentous bacteriophages displaying single chain antibody fragments derived from combinatorial pairings of chicken variable heavy and light chains. Synthetically randomised complementarity determining regions are included in some of the heavy chains. Single chain antibody fragments that recognise haptens, proteins and virus particles were selected from this repertoire. Affinities of three different antibody fragments were determined using surface plasmon resonance. Two were in the low nanomolar and one in the subnanomolar range. To illustrate the practical value of antibodies from the library, phage displayed single chain fragments were incorporated into ELISAs aimed at detecting African horsesickness and bluetongue virus particles. Virus antibodies were detected in a competitive ELISA.ConclusionThe chicken-derived phage library described here is expected to be a versatile source of recombinant antibody fragments directed against a wide variety of antigens. It has the potential to provide monoclonal reagents with applications in research and diagnostics. For in vitro applications, na\u00efve phage libraries based on avian donors may prove to be useful adjuncts to the selectable antibody repertoires that already exist."

Additionally, phage display offers greater versatility in antibody engineering, allowing for the incorporation of specific modifications, such as humanization or affinity maturation, to improve therapeutic efficacy and reduce immunogenicity. Moreover, phage display-derived antibodies offer potential benefits in terms of manufacturing scalability and cost effectiveness. Unlike traditional mAbs produced from hybridoma cell lines, phage-derived antibodies can be generated entirely in vitro, eliminating the need for animal immunization and cell culture-based production systems. This streamlined production process enables rapid and cost-effective antibody development, making phage display an attractive platform for the generation of therapeutic antibodies [22]."

The more recent technologies of yeast and ribosome display are becoming highly established, but phage display is currently the most robust, well characterized, and reliable of these methods. Antibodies derived from these technologies are cloned in microbial hosts and are therefore monoclonal from the start, with their production being easily scaled up. Critically, selection and screening efforts can be directed toward specifi c epitopes or species cross-reactivity and away from polyspecifi c binding. Phage display allows a researcher to do in a single tube what would be unfathomable in traditional hybridoma work: interrogate libraries of millions to tens of billions of antibodies on the basis of their binding specifi cally to a target of interest."

These properties enable better target recognition, improved signal amplification, and enhanced adaptability to various diagnostic platforms. (11 sources)",
                "text": "\nPhage display technology produces antibody fragments with distinct technical advantages over traditional antibodies. One significant benefit is their reduced molecular size. Single chain fragment variables (scFvs) generated through phage display are considerably smaller than conventional antibodies, overcoming size limitations that can affect diagnostic applications <Paper corpusId=\"269059585\" paperTitle=\"(Zheng et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. This smaller footprint allows phage-derived antibodies to access epitopes that might be inaccessible to larger traditional antibodies <Paper corpusId=\"201228624\" paperTitle=\"(Qiu et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe structural stability of phage-derived antibodies represents another crucial technical advantage. Unlike conventional antibodies, phage antibodies demonstrate remarkable stability, often lacking disulfide bonds that can be vulnerable to environmental conditions <Paper corpusId=\"271163341\" paperTitle=\"(Guliy et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. This enhanced stability translates to better performance in various diagnostic conditions, potentially extending shelf-life and improving reliability <Paper corpusId=\"275841635\" paperTitle=\"(Kasana et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"38116085\" paperTitle=\"(Shukra et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nPhage display technology also offers unique signal amplification capabilities. For instance, M13 filamentous phages contain approximately 2,700 copies of the major pVIII coat protein per particle, which can be leveraged for significant signal enhancement when using reporter-conjugated anti-M13 antibodies <Paper corpusId=\"201228624\" paperTitle=\"(Qiu et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. This built-in amplification mechanism gives phage-displayed antibodies a distinct advantage in diagnostic sensitivity.\n\nAnother key technical benefit is the direct access to the genetic information of the binding molecule. This genetic accessibility allows for rapid adaptation of antibody formats to suit specific diagnostic assays, including IgG, scFv-Fc, biotinylated antibodies, or fusion proteins <Paper corpusId=\"44841738\" paperTitle=\"(Schirrmann et al., 2011)\" isShortName></Paper>. This flexibility enables researchers to optimize antibody structure for particular detection platforms.\n\nPhage-displayed antigens also offer advantages in detecting structural epitopes. Unlike linear peptide displays, recombinant antigens on phage surfaces can maintain proper folding and stable structures, allowing for interaction with antibodies that recognize conformational epitopes <Paper corpusId=\"251712361\" paperTitle=\"(Chen et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. Additionally, polyvalent display systems can reduce nonspecific binding, enhancing the specificity of diagnostic assays <Paper corpusId=\"251712361\" paperTitle=\"(Chen et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nIn practical applications, landscape-phage-based interfaces have demonstrated superior performance compared to natural immunoglobulin counterparts in various detector platforms <Paper corpusId=\"46974853\" paperTitle=\"(Petrenko, 2018)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"9192594\" paperTitle=\"(Petrenko et al., 2000)\" isShortName></Paper>. These phage-derived antibodies can bind protein and glycoprotein antigens with nanomolar affinities and high specificity, while being more convenient than traditional antibodies in many aspects <Paper corpusId=\"46974853\" paperTitle=\"(Petrenko, 2018)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"9192594\" paperTitle=\"(Petrenko et al., 2000)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nMoreover, phage-scFvs offer additional practical advantages including ease of purification and labeling compared to free scFvs <Paper corpusId=\"47191392\" paperTitle=\"(Lillo et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper>. The phage display selection process typically yields multiple antibody fragments binding to different epitopes, increasing the likelihood of obtaining useful binders for diagnostic applications <Paper corpusId=\"47191392\" paperTitle=\"(Lillo et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe combination of low molecular weight, high stability, and in vitro production makes phage-like antibodies particularly valuable for biosensor applications. For example, phage display antibodies have been successfully used to detect pathogens like Listeria monocytogenes in surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensors, demonstrating the promise of these non-traditional recognition elements <Paper corpusId=\"265444141\" paperTitle=\"(Guliy et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.",

These antibodies match the strengths of conventionally produced monoclonal antibodies and offer advantages for the development of immunodiagnostic kits and assays. These fragments not only retain the specificity of the whole monoclonal antibodies but also easy to express and produce in prokaryotic expression system. Further, these antibody fragments are genetically stable, less expensive, easy to modify in response to viral mutations and safer than monoclonal antibodies for use in diagnostic and therapeutic applications. This review describes the potential of antibody fragments generated using phage display and their use as diagnostic reagents."

Unlike conventional constructs, however, each virion displays thousands of copies of the peptide in a repeating pattern, subtending a major fraction of the viral surface. The phage body serves as an interacting scaffold to constrain the peptide into a particular conformation, creating a defined organic surface structure ('landscape') that varies from one phage clone to the next. By testing landscape libraries with three representative antigens (streptavidin from the bacterium Streptomyces avidinii, avidin from chicken egg white and beta-galactosidase from Escherichia coli) we have shown that landscape phages may be used as a new type of substitute antibodies-filaments that can bind protein and glycoprotein antigens with nanomolar affinities and high specificity. In many ways these substitute antibodies are more convenient than their natural immunoglobulin counterparts."

                            "Identification of neutralizing antibodies with specificity away from the traditional mutation prone antigenic regions, against the conserved regions of hemagglutinin from H5N1 influenza virus has the potential to provide a therapeutic option which can be developed ahead of time in preparation for a possible pandemic due to H5N1 viruses. In this study, we used a combination of panning strategies against the hemagglutinin (HA) of several antigenic distinct H5N1 isolates to bias selection of Fab-phage from a na\u00efve human library away from the antigenic regions of HA, toward the more conserved portions of the protein. All of the identified Fab clones which showed binding to multiple antigenically distinct HA were converted to fully human IgG, and tested for their ability to neutralize the uptake of H5N1-virus like particles (VLP) into MDCK cells. Five of the antibodies which showed binding to the relatively conserved HA2 subunit of HA, exhibited neutralization of H5N1-VLP uptake in a dose dependant manner. The inhibitory effects of these five antibodies were similar to those observed with a previously described neutralizing antibody specific for the 140s antigenic loop present within HA1 and highlight the exciting possibility that these antibodies may be efficacious against multiple H5N1 strains."

                            "The natural host for Ebola virus, presumed to be an animal, has not yet been identified despite an extensive search following several major outbreaks in Africa. A straightforward approach used to determine animal contact with Ebola virus is by assessing the presence of specific antibodies in serum. This approach however has been made very difficult by the absence of specific reagents required for the detection of antibodies from the majority of wild animal species. In this study, we isolated a human monoclonal antibody Fab fragment, KZ51, that reacts with an immunodominant epitope on Ebola virus nucleoprotein (NP) that is conserved on all four Ebola virus subtypes. The antibody KZ51 represents a major specificity as sera from all convalescent patients tested (10/10) and sera from guinea pigs infected with each of the four Ebola virus subtypes competed strongly with KZ51 for binding to radiation-inactivated Ebola virus. These features allowed us to develop a novel assay for the detection of seroconversion irrespective of Ebola virus subtype or animal species. In this assay, the binding of KZ51 Fab-phage particles is used as an indicator assay and the presence of specific antibodies against Ebola virus in sera is indicated by binding competition. A prominent feature of the assay is that the Fab-phage particles may be prestained with a dye so that detection of binding can be directly determined by visual inspection. The assay is designed to be both simple and economical to enable its use in the field."

                            "BackgroundVenezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) belongs to the Alphavirus group. Several species of this family are also pathogenic to humans and are recognized as potential agents of biological warfare and terrorism. The objective of this work was the generation of recombinant antibodies for the detection of VEEV after a potential bioterrorism assault or an natural outbreak of VEEV.ResultsIn this work, human anti-VEEV single chain Fragments variable (scFv) were isolated for the first time from a human na\u00efve antibody gene library using optimized selection processes. In total eleven different scFvs were identified and their immunological specificity was assessed. The specific detection of the VEEV strains TC83, H12/93 and 230 by the selected antibody fragments was proved. Active as well as formalin inactivated virus particles were recognized by the selected antibody fragments which could be also used for Western blot analysis of VEEV proteins and immunohistochemistry of VEEV infected cells. The anti-VEEV scFv phage clones did not show any cross-reactivity with Alphavirus species of the Western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV) and Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) antigenic complex, nor did they react with Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), if they were used as detection reagent.ConclusionFor the first time, this study describes the selection of antibodies against a human pathogenic virus from a human na\u00efve scFv antibody gene library using complete, active virus particles as antigen. The broad and sensitive applicability of scFv-presenting phage for the immunological detection and diagnosis of Alphavirus species was demonstrated. The selected antibody fragments will improve the fast identification of VEEV in case of a biological warfare or terroristic attack or a natural outbreak."

Identification of the causative agent of the infection is vital for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. Etiological laboratory diagnostic tests are therefore essential to identify pathogens. However, due to its rapidity and automation, the serological diagnostic test is among the methods of great significance for the diagnosis of infections with the basis of detecting antigens or antibodies in body fluids clinically. Epitopes, as a special chemical group that determines the specificity of antigens and the basic unit of inducing immune responses, play an important role in the study of immune responses. Identifying the epitopes of a pathogen may contribute to the development of a vaccine to prevent disease, the diagnosis of the corresponding disease, and the determination of different stages of the disease. Moreover, both the preparation of neutralizing antibodies based on useful epitopes and the assembly of several associated epitopes can be used in the treatment of disease. Epitopes can be divided into B cell epitopes and T cell epitopes; B cell epitopes stimulate the body to produce antibodies and are therefore commonly used as targets for the design of serological diagnostic experiments. Meanwhile, epitopes can fall into two possible categories: linear and conformational. This article reviews the role of B cell epitopes in the clinical diagnosis of infectious diseases."

The selected mimotopes may also be directly used in phage-based ELISA immunoassays, resulting in simple, specific, sensitive, and low-cost immunodiagnostic tests (Goulart et al., 2010). Similarly, the selection of antibodies from combinatorial libraries has also become an important tool for the generation of reagents, diagnostics, and therapeutic molecules. It is the only method to obtain specific antibodies bypassing the immunization step, which mimics the maturation process of human antibody in vivo, resulting in high affinity antibody ligands, which may be suitable to human administration and potentially applicable to clinical diagnosis and treatment."

                            "Many conformational epitopes cannot be mapped by the use of a phage display approach due to the lack of amino acid similarity with the selected peptides. Exploring the potential of the method, we selected mimotopes of the discontinuous, highly conformational epitope of scorpion neurotoxin Cn2, whose 3D structure is known, using its generic neutralizing monoclonal antibody BCF2. With an exhaustive selection procedure, we isolated from a 12-mer phage library a large collection of mimotopes that reproduce the antigenic and immunogenic specificity of the Cn2-epitope. The selected peptides presented three sequence motifs, the most abundant of which, RD(N)XXGF, appeared in 15 different sequence contexts displayed by 97 out of 206 clones. In the most reactive mimotope, displayed by 24 (25%) clones, the motif was flanked by two Cys residues allowing the adoption of a cyclic conformation. Motifs QL(H,M)L(M) and (S/T)WHLP were selected with less efficiency. Comparison of the motifs with the primary and three-dimensional structure of Cn2 as well as with a model of the Cn2-BCF2(Fv) complex suggests that RD(N)XXGF, which does not share sequence similarity with the epitope, mimics its central structural element, turn 7-11, by using an alternative amino acid combination nevertheless keeping the nature of its interactions with BCF2. The QL(H,M)L(M) is assumed to mimic the hydrophobic part of the epitope. The principles of the conformational mimicry by phage-displayed peptides are discussed."

In the present study, we report the successful antigenic and immunogenic mimicry of mannose-containing cell-wall compounds of M. tuberculosis by dodecamer peptides identified by phage-display technology. Using a rabbit antiserum raised against M. tuberculosis cell-surface saccharides as a target for biopanning, peptides with three different consensus sequences were identified. Phage-displayed and chemically synthesized peptides bound to the anticarbohydrate antiserum. Rabbit antibodies elicited against the peptide QEPLMGTVPIRAGGGS recognize the mannosylated M. tuberculosis cell-wall antigens arabinomannan and lipoarabinomannan, and the glycosylated recombinant protein alanine/proline-rich antigen. Furthermore, antibodies were also able to react with mannan from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but not with phosphatidylinositol dimannosides or arabinogalactan from mycobacteria. These results suggest that the immunogenic peptide mimics oligomannosidic epitopes. Interestingly, this report provides evidence that, in contrast with previously known carbohydrate mimotopes, no aromatic residues are necessary in a peptide sequence for mimicking unusual glycoconjugates synthesized by mycobacteria. The possible usefulness of the identified peptide mimotopes as surrogate reagents for immunodiagnosis and for the study of functional roles of the native non-peptide epitopes is discussed."

                            "This enables the identification of antibodies with superior binding properties compared to those obtained through traditional hybridoma-based methods (Moraes et al., 2021). Additionally, phage display offers greater versatility in antibody engineering, allowing for the incorporation of specific modifications, such as humanization or affinity maturation, to improve therapeutic efficacy and reduce immunogenicity. Moreover, phage display-derived antibodies offer potential benefits in terms of manufacturing scalability and cost effectiveness. Unlike traditional mAbs produced from hybridoma cell lines, phage-derived antibodies can be generated entirely in vitro, eliminating the need for animal immunization and cell culture-based production systems. This streamlined production process enables rapid and cost-effective antibody development, making phage display an attractive platform for the generation of therapeutic antibodies [22]."

                            "Nanotechnological tools and biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis, as well as strategies for disease control and monitoring populations at higher risk, are continuous worldwide challenges for infectious diseases. Phage display and monoclonal antibody combinatorial libraries are important sources for biomarker discovery and for improved diagnostic strategies. Mimetic peptides were selected against polyclonal antibodies from patients with dengue fever, leprosy, and leishmaniasis as model diseases, and from immunized chickens with total antigens from all three pathogens. Selected single or combined multi-epitope peptide biomarkers were further associated with four different sensor platforms, classified as affinity biosensors, that may be suitable as general protocols for field diagnosis. We have also developed two methods for nanoparticle agglutination assays (a particle gel agglutination test and a magnetic microparticle [MMP]-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]) and two electrochemical biosensors (impedimetric and amperometric) for DNA and antibody detection. For the agglutination tests, micro- and nanoparticles were coupled with filamentous bacteriophages displaying the selected mimotopes on their surfaces, which has favored the formation of the antigen-antibody or peptide-protein complexes, amplifying the optical detection in ELISA assays or after the chromatographic separation of the microagglutinates. We have also demonstrated a proof-of-concept for the electrochemical biosensors by using electrodes modified with novel functionalized polymers. These electrochemical biosensors have proven to be fast, very sensitive, and specific for the detection of pathogen DNA and circulating antibodies of patients, which may become important in a wide range of diagnostic devices for many infectious agents."

The technology allows for generating antibodies from diverse species including humans, camels, llamas, alpacas, chimpanzees, macaques, pigs, mice, chickens, and sharks <Paper corpusId=\"235748443\" paperTitle=\"(Roth et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. This flexibility is particularly valuable when working with immune libraries from convalescent patients or immunized donors, enabling researchers to isolate affinity-matured antibodies directly <Paper corpusId=\"235748443\" paperTitle=\"(Roth et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, phage display provides practical solutions in scenarios where immunization is impossible, ethically problematic, or when patient samples are unavailable <Paper corpusId=\"31871816\" paperTitle=\"(Kuhn et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>. The technology's in vitro nature circumvents immune system limitations, theoretically allowing antibody generation against virtually any conceivable molecule <Paper corpusId=\"31871816\" paperTitle=\"(Kuhn et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>. For instance, universal antibody gene libraries offer alternatives when traditional immunization approaches are not feasible <Paper corpusId=\"235748443\" paperTitle=\"(Roth et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nIn practical applications, engineered bacteriophages demonstrate exceptional potential for ethical detection methods. For example, bacteriophages displaying specific antibody fragments or mimotopes have shown high affinity for targets like cholera toxin, offering precise quantification capabilities without relying on animal-derived methods <Paper corpusId=\"261854381\" paperTitle=\"(Li et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This approach represents an important shift toward more ethical detection strategies while maintaining or even improving sensitivity and accuracy <Paper corpusId=\"261854381\" paperTitle=\"(Li et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe ability to easily engineer phage-displayed antibodies according to application requirements provides additional practical benefits <Paper corpusId=\"31871816\" paperTitle=\"(Kuhn et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>. Since the DNA sequence encoding the antibodies is directly accessible from the phage, researchers can modify antibodies to suit specific diagnostic contexts, adding another layer of practical advantage to this ethically sound technology <Paper corpusId=\"31871816\" paperTitle=\"(Kuhn et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>.",

These antibodies can detect diverse pathogens with high specificity, requiring minimal sample preparation and providing results in minutes rather than hours or days needed for conventional testing. (10 sources)",
                "text": "\nPhage display technology has enabled the development of antibody-based diagnostics with exceptional versatility across different detection platforms. These antibodies can be readily incorporated into conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) as well as cutting-edge biotechnological platforms like surface plasmon resonance (SPR) immunosensors <Paper corpusId=\"212737645\" paperTitle=\"(Lima et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"25303200\" paperTitle=\"(Rojas et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>. This adaptability makes phage-derived antibodies particularly valuable for a wide range of diagnostic applications.\n\nA major performance advantage of phage display antibodies is their remarkable detection speed. For instance, lateral flow test strips employing phage-displayed antibody fragments can detect live Salmonella within just 15 minutes, while conventional biochemical and serological confirmation tests require at least 24 hours <Paper corpusId=\"252570448\" paperTitle=\"(Charlermroj et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. This dramatic reduction in detection time allows for more rapid clinical decision-making and infection control measures.\n\nPhage display-derived antibodies also demonstrate impressive sensitivity in diagnostic applications. Research has shown that phage-mediated ELISA can be more sensitive toward antigens compared to conventional antibody-based ELISA methods <Paper corpusId=\"270748518\" paperTitle=\"(Sadraeian et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. This enhanced sensitivity is exemplified in a phage-ELISA system for Salmonella enteritidis detection that achieved a detection limit of 10\u2074 CFU/mL, surpassing traditional ELISA sensitivity by an order of magnitude <Paper corpusId=\"275409337\" paperTitle=\"(Shen et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>. This improved performance can be attributed to the capacity for multiple antibody probes to simultaneously bind to a single target and each phage clone's ability to accommodate hundreds of reporter-labeled antibodies.\n\nThe technology has proven particularly valuable for developing diagnostic tools for dangerous pathogens. Phage display has been utilized to create new diagnostic tools for lethal viruses including Zika, Ebola, Hendra, Nipah, Hanta, Middle East respiratory disease (MERS), and SARS <Paper corpusId=\"259226246\" paperTitle=\"(Guliy et al._1, 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"232158116\" paperTitle=\"(Anand et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"31871816\" paperTitle=\"(Kuhn et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>. Although PCR remains the gold standard for viral detection, sensor technologies using phage antibodies as sensitive elements are increasingly promising due to their simplicity, effectiveness, rapid results, and cost-efficiency.\n\nAnother significant diagnostic advantage is the ability to develop antibodies that can distinguish between highly related antigens. Researchers have demonstrated that within just four weeks, phage display can generate panels of IgGs capable of differentiating between influenza virus nucleoprotein (NP) subtypes with sequence identities exceeding 90% <Paper corpusId=\"221018675\" paperTitle=\"(Yu et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. These antibodies exhibited detection limits below 1 nM for viral NP from lysed virus samples using sandwich ELISA, with affinities comparable to mouse antibodies but obtained in a fraction of the time.\n\nPhage display also offers unique advantages for high-throughput diagnostic applications. The technology allows peptides of various sizes to be easily expressed, with libraries that can be amplified to produce high-titer stock solutions that can be replenished indefinitely. Screening can be conducted in small manageable micro-volumes, making phage-displayed domain scans particularly suitable for high-throughput applications <Paper corpusId=\"231858431\" paperTitle=\"(Hada-Neeman et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. Additionally, next-generation sequencing multiplexing enables comprehensive analysis of affinity-selected peptides, providing a broader view of humoral immune responses to infections and other conditions.",

High throughput fine specificity determination remains technically challenging. We review recent experiences aimed at revisiting the oldest and most extended display technology to develop a robust epitope mapping platform, based on the ability to manipulate target-derived molecules (ranging from the whole native antigen to antigen domains and smaller fragments) on filamentous phages. Single, multiple and combinatorial mutagenesis allowed comprehensive scanning of phage-displayed antigen surface that resulted in the identification of clusters of residues contributing to epitope formation. Functional pictures of the epitope(s) were thus delineated in the natural context. Successful mapping of antibodies against interleukin-2, epidermal growth factor and its receptor, and vascular endothelial growth factor showed the versatility of these procedures, which combine the accuracy of site-directed mutagenesis with the high throughput potential of phage display."

                            "Phage display technology antibodies as nano-bio-engineered macromolecules can be used for sensor-based virus detection. In order to recognize lethal viruses such as Zika, Ebola, Hendra, Nipah, Hanta, Middle East respiratory disease (MERS), and SARS, phage display has been utilized to create new diagnostic tools (Kuhn et al., 2016)(Anand et al., 2021)",
                            "The selection of antibody fragments from phage display libraries thus offers the potential to access very large numbers of molecules with different binding specificities quickly and cheaply, avoiding the need for animal immunizations. The scFv can be genetically engineered to produce tailored constructs as described above. Such phage antibodies can be coated directly onto metal, plastic, silica or carbon surfaces by simple adsorption, which, as discussed above, is adequate for biosensor-based assays",
                            "Despite its drawbacks, the use of PCR to identify particular viral genomic sequences while an infection is still active is still regarded as the best virus detection technique. However, sensor technologies using phage antibodies as sensitive elements are very promising because antibodies generated by phage display are an excellent alternative to classical antibodies",

These characteristics make them particularly cost-effective for biosensor applications. Studies have confirmed that phage antibodies not only ensure highly sensitive antigen detection but are also \"much cheaper to make\" than traditional antibody alternatives <Paper corpusId=\"271163341\" paperTitle=\"(Guliy et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nAnother economic benefit comes from the built-in signal amplification capabilities of phage-displayed antibodies. M13 filamentous phages contain approximately 2,700 copies of the major pVIII coat protein per particle, which can be leveraged for significant signal enhancement using reporter-conjugated anti-M13 antibodies <Paper corpusId=\"201228624\" paperTitle=\"(Qiu et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. This natural amplification system can reduce or eliminate the need for additional costly detection reagents in diagnostic applications.\n\nThe overall economic value proposition of landscape phage-based interfaces is compelling. These systems have performed \"much more effectively than their natural immunoglobulin counterparts\" in various detector platforms while addressing the limitations of traditional monoclonal antibodies, which include \"high cost, low specificity, less-than-optimal affinity, and sensitivity to environmental stresses\" <Paper corpusId=\"46974853\" paperTitle=\"(Petrenko, 2018)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"9192594\" paperTitle=\"(Petrenko et al., 2000)\" isShortName></Paper>.

In vitro selections by phage display facilitates the production of novel receptors beyond known biomolecular interactions, or against toxic or nonimmunogenic targets, or even using whole cells as the target. 1"

                            "In 'landscape' phage, as in traditional phage-display constructs, foreign peptides or proteins are fused to coat proteins on the surface of a filamentous phage particle. Unlike conventional constructs, however, each virion displays thousands of copies of the peptide in a repeating pattern, subtending a major fraction of the viral surface. The phage body serves as an interacting scaffold to constrain the peptide into a particular conformation, creating a defined organic surface structure ('landscape') that varies from one phage clone to the next. By testing landscape libraries with three representative antigens (streptavidin from the bacterium Streptomyces avidinii, avidin from chicken egg white and beta-galactosidase from Escherichia coli) we have shown that landscape phages may be used as a new type of substitute antibodies-filaments that can bind protein and glycoprotein antigens with nanomolar affinities and high specificity. In many ways these substitute antibodies are more convenient than their natural immunoglobulin counterparts."
