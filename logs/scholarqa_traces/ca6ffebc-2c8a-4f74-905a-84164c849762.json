As the initial step of affinity maturation for antibody C0020187, block mutagenesis was used to diversify sequences in the CDR regions. Multiple libraries were designed for optimal coverage of sequences in each CDR (Fig. 1B and SI Appendix, Fig. S1). All six CDRs were included in the mutagenesis scheme and optimized in parallel to maximize the sequence space from which variants with improved affinities may emerge, and later recombined. \n\nThese libraries were selected in soluble phage-display selections. Individual clones were sampled from the outputs of each CDR group, and tested as scFvs in periplasmic extracts (21) using a homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence-based epitope competition (EC) assay (22) in parallel with a functional screen, the enzyme inhibition assay (EIA). The EC assay is a measure of how well an incoming scFv is able to compete with the parental antibody for the epitope and is thus a surrogate measure for binding affinity. The EIA assay is a read-out of functional activity, benchmarked against the parental antibody's ability to inhibit the enzymatic activity of ARG2. Together, these assays inform which optimization groups were likely to generate clones with improved affinity and potency over the parent. Optimization in the CDRH1 (H1) and CDRH2 (H2) groups presented with the highest total hit rates, at 43% and 54%, respectively, in the final rounds, whereas CDRH3 (H3) optimization resulted in the lowest hit rates at 12% (Fig. 2). The total hit rate for CDRL2 (L2) at round 3 is 36%, compared to 25% for CDRL1 (L1) and CDRL3 (L3). Interestingly, the hit rates for the VL outputs decreased after round 3, suggesting that there was no further enrichment of higher-affinity clones in these selection groups at the lowest antigen concentration bracket. \n\nUnbiased Recombination of Optimized CDR Regions Using the Shuffle and ShuffleStEP Methods.",

We exemplified the significance of this method by contrasting the crystal structure of the parent and optimized antibodies bound to Arginase 2, which revealed a striking reorientation of the binding paratope, concurrent with distinct improvements in inhibitory potency and binding properties. The nature and magnitude of the epitope expansion was extraordinary and unlikely to have been produced through conventional affinity-maturation methods. This innovative approach demonstrates broad applicability to the optimization of candidate therapeutic antibodies, even those less amenable to CDRH3 targeting. Affinity maturation is a powerful technique in antibody engineering for the in vitro evolution of antigen binding interactions. Key to the success of this process is the expansion of sequence and combinatorial diversity to increase the structural repertoire from which superior binding variants may be selected. However, conventional strategies are often restrictive and only focus on small regions of the antibody at a time. In this study, we used a method that combined antibody chain shuffling and a staggered-extension process to produce unbiased libraries, which recombined beneficial mutations from all six complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) in the affinity maturation of an inhibitory antibody to Arginase 2 (ARG2). We made use of the vast display capacity of ribosome display to accommodate the sequence space required for the diverse library builds. Further diversity was introduced through pool maturation to optimize seven leads of interest simultaneously. This resulted in antibodies with substantial improvements in binding properties and inhibition potency. The extensive sequence changes resulting from this approach were translated into striking structural changes for parent and affinity-matured antibodies bound to ARG2, with a large reorientation of the binding paratope facilitating increases in contact surface and shape complementarity to the antigen. The considerable gains in therapeutic properties seen from extensive sequence and structural evolution of the parent ARG2 inhibitory antibody clearly illustrate the advantages of the unbiased approach developed, which was key to the identification of high-affinity antibodies with the desired inhibitory potency and specificity.\n## Results\nOptimization of Sequences in the Six CDR Regions.

            "abstract": "ABSTRACT Introduction Phage display technology is a well-established versatile in vitro display technology that has been used for over 35 years to identify peptides and antibodies for use as reagents and therapeutics, as well as exploring the diversity of alternative scaffolds as another option to conventional therapeutic antibody discovery. Such successes have been responsible for spawning a range of biotechnology companies, as well as many complementary technologies devised to expedite the drug discovery process and resolve bottlenecks in the discovery workflow. Areas covered In this perspective, the authors summarize the application of phage display for drug discovery and provide examples of protein-based drugs that have either been approved or are being developed in the clinic. The amenability of phage display to generate functional protein molecules to challenging targets and recent developments of strategies and techniques designed to harness the power of sampling diverse repertoires are highlighted. Expert opinion Phage display is now routinely combined with cutting-edge technologies to deep-mine antibody-based repertoires, peptide, or alternative scaffold libraries generating a wealth of data that can be leveraged, e.g. via artificial intelligence, to enable the potential for clinical success in the discovery and development of protein-based therapeutics.",

                    "text": "It was observed that loop length and CDR-H3 stem composition (potentially stabilizing the loop) played a key role in the functional output, whereas diversification of CDR-L3 was not essential for library performance. This was further borne out by demonstrating proof of principle using delta-like ligand 4 (DLL4) as antigen and isolating high affinity binders with neutralization of the DLL4-NOTCH1 interaction yielding IC 50 values below 10 nM (and equivalent to a benchmark antibody directed to DLL4). Broadening the diversity by the inclusion of nonparatope residues not only enhances affinity but is necessary for target specificity, as well as CDR-H3 loop length [52] and the CDR-L3 loop length influences VH antigen interactions [55]. \n\nThus, semisynthetic and synthetic libraries incorporate design features such as a germline framework known to have favorable developability features. The most important aspect of diversity in any phage antibody library is that of the complementarity determining regions or CDRs, which confer antigen recognition and specificity. Many more examples of strategies applied to generate a robust phage display library for antibody discovery have been comprehensively reviewed in several recent publications [25,31] as well as the key attributes of historically important antibody libraries constructed for the identification of therapeutic antibodies [31]. \n\nDirect synthesis has enabled a much higher degree of precision and efficiency. Through solid-phase synthesis along with miniaturized chemistry, it is possible to synthesize oligonucleotides without randomization. Specifically, DNA synthesis can now be reliably performed on a large scale [57,58], such that millions of custom oligonucleotides can be synthesized as oligo pools on chip surfaces making the generation of large libraries of deliberately designed antibodies [59] that can be rapidly produced and screened in parallel. Significantly, such libraries need not be full-length antibodies as synthesis only needs to be restricted to antibody regions that contain CDR loops, such as VHH, scFv, and Fab antibody fragments. This approach opens the door to high-throughput screening opportunities. As with other synthesis methods, direct synthesis is not without its hurdles. Highly parallel direct oligonucleotide synthesis requires substantial infrastructure and automation.",

                    "text": "However, a glycine residue in the CDR-H3 was determined to be critical for the paratope conformation enabling high affinity binding. A high throughput workflow process was established and pressure-tested using a panel of proteins to demonstrate that reduction in the complexity in the design of the library circumvented some of the common challenges encountered with natural antibodies that can stall high throughput processes, such as expression, purification, and sequence analysis, and could have potential utility for proteomic studies and identify features in CDR sequences that regulate antibody:antigen interactions. In fact, this approach has also been applied to the 10 FN3 alternative scaffold [54]. \n\nWhile Tyr/Ser binary libraries will produce high affinity antibodies for some antigens, this is not true for all protein classes, implying that greater diversity would be required for a broader range of antigens and wider applications, and may even need to be tailored to specific protein target classes with more complex structures. Thus, the minimalist synthetic CDR-H3 library strategy was explored further to generate antibodies with therapeutic potential [55]. Trinucleotide synthesis technology [56] was employed to introduce approx. equal quantities of all amino acids at each engineered position (other than cysteine) in order to evaluate the contribution of amino acid classes to antibody function. Therefore, libraries were constructed on a single framework scaffold, the clinically validated DP47 heavy chain and DP-K22 light chain, with either randomization of the CDR-H3 alone or the CDR-H3 and CDR-L3 and included incorporation of a range of loop lengths (in equal proportions rather than the parabolic distribution seen with the natural human antibody repertoire). These libraries were evaluated on a number of different types of antigen to determine the influence of the amino acid composition and CDR length on the output from the selections. It was observed that loop length and CDR-H3 stem composition (potentially stabilizing the loop) played a key role in the functional output, whereas diversification of CDR-L3 was not essential for library performance.",

Hutchings, Aaron K. Sato\n## Abstract\nABSTRACT Introduction Phage display technology is a well-established versatile in vitro display technology that has been used for over 35 years to identify peptides and antibodies for use as reagents and therapeutics, as well as exploring the diversity of alternative scaffolds as another option to conventional therapeutic antibody discovery. Such successes have been responsible for spawning a range of biotechnology companies, as well as many complementary technologies devised to expedite the drug discovery process and resolve bottlenecks in the discovery workflow. Areas covered In this perspective, the authors summarize the application of phage display for drug discovery and provide examples of protein-based drugs that have either been approved or are being developed in the clinic. The amenability of phage display to generate functional protein molecules to challenging targets and recent developments of strategies and techniques designed to harness the power of sampling diverse repertoires are highlighted. Expert opinion Phage display is now routinely combined with cutting-edge technologies to deep-mine antibody-based repertoires, peptide, or alternative scaffold libraries generating a wealth of data that can be leveraged, e.g. via artificial intelligence, to enable the potential for clinical success in the discovery and development of protein-based therapeutics.\n## Article highlights\nThe immune repertoire was sourced from lymph nodes from seven different donors, peripheral blood lymphocytes from nine different donors, spleen from one donor, and tonsil RNA from five donors. All six CDRs from donor repertoires were amplified and reassembled into a single light (DP-L3) and heavy chain (VH3-23) framework that is well-presented in the human repertoire and well-expressed in host cells [47]. This approach circumvents loss in diversity due to low expression or the display level of certain germline genes. The library was validated against a range of haptens, peptides, carbohydrates, and proteins and has successfully isolated antibody clones with subnanomolar affinities; in fact, at least five mAbs generated using the n-CoDer TM library have entered clinical trials. The semisynthetic strategy has been refined further by grafting naturally occurring CDRs from human antibodies into frameworks based on well-behaved clinical antibodies, referred to as a Generation Three design [48], in order to address the identification of highly developable therapeutic antibodies directly from the library, CDR-H3 sequences were amplified directly from B cells, while the remaining CDRs were sourced from a large next-generation sequencing dataset and all sequence liabilities eliminated. The resulting scFv library is 9 \u00d7 10 9 in size with the CDR diversity incorporated into 4 VH frameworks, 3 V\u03ba frameworks, and 1 V\u03bb framework [48]. In addition, two in vitro display platforms, phage and yeast display, were implemented to isolate diverse antibodies to clinically relevant protein targets, yielding affinities down to the subnanomolar and picomolar range demonstrating that this approach has the potential to considerably reduce discovery timelines. \n\nIn the early days of antibody phage display, the initial focus was on generating large diverse repertoires (>10 10 transformants) to identify high affinity functional binders, which was subsequently followed by addressing aspects of sequence liabilities via synthetic approaches to resolve developability and expression challenges that occurred with some naturally occurring antibody sequences and errors introduced by initial synthetic approaches, as well as removal of T cell epitopes, for example, by the selection of frameworks that exhibited optimal stability and expression.\n...\nIn the early days of antibody phage display, the initial focus was on generating large diverse repertoires (>10 10 transformants) to identify high affinity functional binders, which was subsequently followed by addressing aspects of sequence liabilities via synthetic approaches to resolve developability and expression challenges that occurred with some naturally occurring antibody sequences and errors introduced by initial synthetic approaches, as well as removal of T cell epitopes, for example, by the selection of frameworks that exhibited optimal stability and expression. These early synthetic libraries focused on using selected frameworks restricting diversity to the CDRs [49,50], but were unable to robustly generate high affinity antibodies against a broad range of protein targets. Thus, as well as efforts to expand the diversity further in all the CDR loops, the range of well-behaved frameworks was increased to generate content that better reflected the natural repertoire observed in humans [24,51]. Modular design features enabling facile engineering, such as for affinity maturation, were incorporated [46] along with a focus on antibody sequences (and therefore structure) that impacted on performance and function. \n\nOne avenue of refining synthetic library design has been to take a minimalist strategy and decrease randomization by using a single framework with a binary code to diversify the CDR-H3. In one such study, Tyr and Ser were selected as these have been found to be highly abundant in antibody binding sites [52]. The initial library randomized only the VH CDR positions by binary code [53] and then diversity expanded incrementally to the VL CDR positions, as well as nonparatope residues that may impact on CDR conformation and structure. Improvements in affinity (to single digit nanomolar) were observed for the model soluble antigen used (VEGF) where the tyrosine side chains were sufficient to mediate the majority of antigen interactions.

A high throughput workflow process was established and pressure-tested using a panel of proteins to demonstrate that reduction in the complexity in the design of the library circumvented some of the common challenges encountered with natural antibodies that can stall high throughput processes, such as expression, purification, and sequence analysis, and could have potential utility for proteomic studies and identify features in CDR sequences that regulate antibody:antigen interactions. In fact, this approach has also been applied to the 10 FN3 alternative scaffold [54]. \n\nWhile Tyr/Ser binary libraries will produce high affinity antibodies for some antigens, this is not true for all protein classes, implying that greater diversity would be required for a broader range of antigens and wider applications, and may even need to be tailored to specific protein target classes with more complex structures. Thus, the minimalist synthetic CDR-H3 library strategy was explored further to generate antibodies with therapeutic potential [55]. Trinucleotide synthesis technology [56] was employed to introduce approx. equal quantities of all amino acids at each engineered position (other than cysteine) in order to evaluate the contribution of amino acid classes to antibody function. Therefore, libraries were constructed on a single framework scaffold, the clinically validated DP47 heavy chain and DP-K22 light chain, with either randomization of the CDR-H3 alone or the CDR-H3 and CDR-L3 and included incorporation of a range of loop lengths (in equal proportions rather than the parabolic distribution seen with the natural human antibody repertoire). These libraries were evaluated on a number of different types of antigen to determine the influence of the amino acid composition and CDR length on the output from the selections. It was observed that loop length and CDR-H3 stem composition (potentially stabilizing the loop) played a key role in the functional output, whereas diversification of CDR-L3 was not essential for library performance.\n...\nIt was observed that loop length and CDR-H3 stem composition (potentially stabilizing the loop) played a key role in the functional output, whereas diversification of CDR-L3 was not essential for library performance. This was further borne out by demonstrating proof of principle using delta-like ligand 4 (DLL4) as antigen and isolating high affinity binders with neutralization of the DLL4-NOTCH1 interaction yielding IC 50 values below 10 nM (and equivalent to a benchmark antibody directed to DLL4). Broadening the diversity by the inclusion of nonparatope residues not only enhances affinity but is necessary for target specificity, as well as CDR-H3 loop length [52] and the CDR-L3 loop length influences VH antigen interactions [55]. \n\nThus, semisynthetic and synthetic libraries incorporate design features such as a germline framework known to have favorable developability features. The most important aspect of diversity in any phage antibody library is that of the complementarity determining regions or CDRs, which confer antigen recognition and specificity. Many more examples of strategies applied to generate a robust phage display library for antibody discovery have been comprehensively reviewed in several recent publications [25,31] as well as the key attributes of historically important antibody libraries constructed for the identification of therapeutic antibodies [31]. \n\nDirect synthesis has enabled a much higher degree of precision and efficiency. Through solid-phase synthesis along with miniaturized chemistry, it is possible to synthesize oligonucleotides without randomization. Specifically, DNA synthesis can now be reliably performed on a large scale [57,58], such that millions of custom oligonucleotides can be synthesized as oligo pools on chip surfaces making the generation of large libraries of deliberately designed antibodies [59] that can be rapidly produced and screened in parallel. Significantly, such libraries need not be full-length antibodies as synthesis only needs to be restricted to antibody regions that contain CDR loops, such as VHH, scFv, and Fab antibody fragments. This approach opens the door to high-throughput screening opportunities. As with other synthesis methods, direct synthesis is not without its hurdles. Highly parallel direct oligonucleotide synthesis requires substantial infrastructure and automation.",

Ideally, the selection process is dominated by the former, and all the retrieved clones are amplified equally during the latter. In reality, the amplification efficiency of antibody fragments varies widely among different sequences and, after a few rounds of phage display panning, the output repertoire often includes rapidly amplified sequences with low or no binding activity, significantly diminishing the efficiency of antibody isolation. In this work, a novel synthetic single-chain variable fragment (scFv) library with complementarity-determining region (CDR) diversities aimed at improved amplification efficiency was designed and constructed. A previously reported synthetic scFv library with low, non-combinatorial CDR diversities was panned against protein A superantigen, and the library repertoires before and after the panning were analyzed by next generation sequencing. The enrichment or depletion patterns of CDR sequences after panning served as the basis for the design of the new library. Especially for CDR-H3 with a higher and more random diversity, a machine learning method was applied to predict potential fast-amplified sequences among a simulated sequence repertoire. In a direct comparison with the previous generation library, the new library performed better against a panel of antigens in terms of the number of binders isolated, the number of unique sequences, and/or the speed of binder enrichment. Our results suggest that the amplification-centric design of sequence diversity is a valid strategy for the construction of highly functional phage display antibody libraries.\n## Introduction\nIn this report, we attempted to alleviate the problem of amplification bias by designing an antibody library consisting of clones with a better amplification profile and that are thus less likely to be outcompeted by non-binders during the amplification phase of biopanning (Figure 1). Using a previously constructed library with low, non-combinatorial complementarity-determining region (CDR) diversities (OPAL-S) [3], single-chain variable fragment (scFv) clones that were amplified and/or displayed more efficiently were enriched by panning against protein A from Staphylocucccus aureus. Protein A is primarily known for its binding activity to the Fc portion of immunoglobulins [19], but it also binds to variable domains belonging to human VH3 subgroup [20]; this unique characteristic has been utilized to select well-folded and highly displayed antibody fragments from phage libraries [10,21,22]. The effect of CDR sequences on the panning enrichment of antibody clones was evaluated by comparing the next generation sequencing (NGS) repertoires of the library before and after panning. CDR sequences for the new library were designed based on the NGS analysis and, especially for CDR-H3, machine learning (ML) models were trained from the sequencing data and utilized to predict fast-amplified sequences. The new library, OPAL-T, generally performed better than OPAL-S when tested against a panel of antigens, highlighting the effectiveness of the antibody library design strategy focused on amplification efficiency. The enrichment pattern of CDR sequences was applied to the design of OPAL-T. For CDR-H3 especially, ML models were trained on the NGS data and utilized for the design of improved CDR-H3 diversity.\n\n## Discussion\nDuring panning of a phage-displayed antibody library, the selection outcome is determined not only by the binding affinity to the target antigen, but also in large part by the display level and/or growth rates of the clones.

The CDRH3 loop, which exists in a variety of different lengths (5-30 amino acids), is of particular importance due to its substantial impact on the canonical conformation and antigen binding compared to the other CDRs (156,(162)(163)(164)(165). Noteworthy, the loop length of CDRH3 does not only affect the specificity and affinity of the antibody for its specific antigen, but also affects the nature of the binding of other CDRs. Specifically, for antibodies with long CDRH3 loops, these loops are responsible for most of the antibody-antigen interactions, while in antibodies with short CDRH3 loops, other CDRs loops usually assist in antigen binding (156). Thus, CDRH3 plays a major role in recognizing diverse targets, and generating interactions with acceptable affinity (166,167). \n\nThe diversity of the V-gene segments can be designed and synthesized artificially by CDRs randomization. These libraries can be fully synthetic or semisynthetic. Synthetic libraries are made to maximize antibodies' functionality by making a large and highly diverse phage repertoire. This is usually achieved in vitro by using PCR and oligonucleotides to create a random integration of the CDRs as well as introduction of different CDRH3 loop sequences and lengths without disrupting the folding of the V regions (94,168). Semisynthetic libraries combine natural and synthetic antibody diversity. They are constructed from non-rearranged Vgenes from pre-B cells, or an antibody framework with randomization of the CDRH3 or several CDRs utilizing degenerated oligonucleotides (128,169,170).",

In contrast to monovalent antibodies, which consist of two identical antigen-binding sites, bispecific antibodies can target two different epitopes by containing two different antigen-binding sites.

One of the determining factors for successful isolation of recombinant antibodies from libraries lies in the quality of the libraries i.e. the number of correctly folded, functional antibodies contained in the library. Here, we describe the construction of a novel, high quality, synthetic single domain antibody library dubbed Predator. The library is based on the HEL4 domain antibody with the addition of recently reported mutations concerning the amino acid composition at positions critical for the folding characteristics and aggregation propensities of domain antibodies. As a unique feature, the CDR3 of the library was designed to mimic the natural human immune response by designating amino acids known to be prevalent in functional antibodies to the diversity in CDR3. CDR randomizations were performed using trinucleotide synthesis to avoid the presence of stop codons. Furthermore a novel cycle free elongation method was used for the conversion of the synthesized single stranded DNA containing the randomized CDRs into double stranded DNA of the library. In addition a modular approach has been adopted for the scaffold in which each CDR region is flanked by unique restrictions sites, allowing easy affinity maturation of selected clones by CDR shuffling. To validate the quality of the library, one round phage display selections were performed on purified antigens and highly complex antigen mixtures such as cultured eukaryotic cells resulting in several specific binders. The further characterization of some of the selected clones, however, indicates a reduction in thermodynamic stability caused by the inclusion the additional mutations to the HEL4 scaffold.",

The composition of the CDR loops may have a significant influence on the antibody aggregation propensity. This is important to take into consideration when creating diversity for synthetic libraries as the natural selection in the immune cells is absent and the risk of aggregation of antibody clones might thus be increased. Propensities for aggregation were taken into account in the design of the CDR2 diversity, based on previously published work of the amino acid composition in CDR2 [6]. Generally the use of the most hydrophobic amino acids (i.e. V, I, L, M, and F) was kept at a moderate to low level (with a 0-25% likelihood of a hydrophobic amino acid at any given randomized position). This was done to lower the overall hydrophobicity of the CDRs thereby reducing the risk of aggregation [6], while at the same time allowing hydrophobic contributions to the antigen binding. Additional favorable contributions to binding, documented for tyrosine, serine and glycine, were taken into account in the design of both the CDR2 and CDR3 [40]. Positively charged amino acids were omitted or kept at very low frequencies for CDR2 and CDR3 respectively, as a high frequency of these have been linked to promotion of poly-reactivity (lack of specificity) and increased nucleic acid binding of the antibodies [16,40]. The CDR2 was designed to have a low diversity by limited randomization of only four positions (Figure 3). This entails that the overall diversity is minimized, thus ensuring that the total library diversity can be sampled in the phage display system. The choice of amino acids and their frequencies in the randomized positions were based on refolding studies of dAbs [6]. Due to the genetic rearrangements underlying the natural immune repertoire it is the CDR3 loop in the antibody repertoire which displays the highest diversity. Therefore the CDR3 loop in Predator library was designed to take this into account by randomizing seven positions.",

Mandrup, Niels Anton Friis, S. Lykkemark, Jesper Just, P. Kristensen\n## Abstract\nToday a number of synthetic antibody libraries of different formats have been created and used for the selection of a large number of recombinant antibodies. One of the determining factors for successful isolation of recombinant antibodies from libraries lies in the quality of the libraries i.e. the number of correctly folded, functional antibodies contained in the library. Here, we describe the construction of a novel, high quality, synthetic single domain antibody library dubbed Predator. The library is based on the HEL4 domain antibody with the addition of recently reported mutations concerning the amino acid composition at positions critical for the folding characteristics and aggregation propensities of domain antibodies. As a unique feature, the CDR3 of the library was designed to mimic the natural human immune response by designating amino acids known to be prevalent in functional antibodies to the diversity in CDR3. CDR randomizations were performed using trinucleotide synthesis to avoid the presence of stop codons. Furthermore a novel cycle free elongation method was used for the conversion of the synthesized single stranded DNA containing the randomized CDRs into double stranded DNA of the library. In addition a modular approach has been adopted for the scaffold in which each CDR region is flanked by unique restrictions sites, allowing easy affinity maturation of selected clones by CDR shuffling. To validate the quality of the library, one round phage display selections were performed on purified antigens and highly complex antigen mixtures such as cultured eukaryotic cells resulting in several specific binders. The further characterization of some of the selected clones, however, indicates a reduction in thermodynamic stability caused by the inclusion the additional mutations to the HEL4 scaffold.\n## Introduction\nIn the case of synthetic generation of diversity using trinucleotide synthesis, the method allows for the full control of the amino acid composition in the CDRs. This has, for example, been used to generate minimalistic antibody libraries constructed with as few as two amino acids in the randomized CDR region [19,20]. Semi-synthetic libraries with different combinations of synthetically and naturally host derived diversity have also been created. \n\nUnlike the immunized and na\u00efve libraries, the synthetic and semisynthetic libraries can be made using only one or few of the antibody framework repertoires. This reduces the contribution to diversity from the interface residues bordering the CDRs. It has, however, been shown, both in vitro and in vivo, that some variable (V) segments are much more commonly used in functional antibodies than others. Furthermore there are great differences in the stability and suitability for bacterial expression between different frameworks [21,22]. \n\nFollowing the creation of large libraries of recombinant antibodies, systems, which allow sorting of the libraries, need to be introduced and here display of the recombinant antibodies on the surface of the filamentous bacteriophage (phage) have played a pioneering role. The application known as \"phage display\" was first developed by G.P Smith in 1985 [23]. In phage display a foreign protein is expressed in fusion with one of the phage capsid proteins by cloning the foreign DNA sequence into the same reading frame as the gene of the chosen capsid protein. The major strength of phage display is the physical coupling between the phenotype (the fusion protein) and the genotype (the DNA inside the virion encoding the fusion protein). This coupling allows for high throughput selection of desirable properties of the fusion protein from libraries with billions of variants. There are two very important aspects of phage display selection of recombinant antibodies, namely the nature and quality of the material containing the antigen selected against, and perhaps more overlooked the quality and design of the displayed antibody library itself.\n\n## The diversity\nThe diversities of the CDR2 and CDR3 sequences were designed to take into account important characteristics regarding the amino acids placed in the CDR regions. The composition of the CDR loops may have a significant influence on the antibody aggregation propensity. This is important to take into consideration when creating diversity for synthetic libraries as the natural selection in the immune cells is absent and the risk of aggregation of antibody clones might thus be increased. Propensities for aggregation were taken into account in the design of the CDR2 diversity, based on previously published work of the amino acid composition in CDR2 [6]. Generally the use of the most hydrophobic amino acids (i.e. V, I, L, M, and F) was kept at a moderate to low level (with a 0-25% likelihood of a hydrophobic amino acid at any given randomized position). This was done to lower the overall hydrophobicity of the CDRs thereby reducing the risk of aggregation [6], while at the same time allowing hydrophobic contributions to the antigen binding. Additional favorable contributions to binding, documented for tyrosine, serine and glycine, were taken into account in the design of both the CDR2 and CDR3 [40]. Positively charged amino acids were omitted or kept at very low frequencies for CDR2 and CDR3 respectively, as a high frequency of these have been linked to promotion of poly-reactivity (lack of specificity) and increased nucleic acid binding of the antibodies [16,40]. The CDR2 was designed to have a low diversity by limited randomization of only four positions (Figure 3). This entails that the overall diversity is minimized, thus ensuring that the total library diversity can be sampled in the phage display system. The choice of amino acids and their frequencies in the randomized positions were based on refolding studies of dAbs [6]. Due to the genetic rearrangements underlying the natural immune repertoire it is the CDR3 loop in the antibody repertoire which displays the highest diversity. Therefore the CDR3 loop in Predator library was designed to take this into account by randomizing seven positions.",

The limited library sequence diversity together with excessive redundancy and labour-consuming procedure for candidate identification are two major obstacles to widespread adoption of this technology. We hereby describe a novel library generation and screening approach to address the problems. The approach started with the targeted diversification of multiple complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of a humanized anti-ErbB2 antibody, HuA21, with a small perturbation mutagenesis strategy. A combination of three degenerate codons, NWG, NWC, and NSG, were chosen for amino acid saturation mutagenesis without introducing cysteine and stop residues. In total, 7,749 degenerate oligonucleotides were synthesized on two microchips and released to construct five single-chain antibody fragment (scFv) gene libraries with 4 x 106 DNA sequences. Deep sequencing of the unselected and selected phage libraries using the Illumina platform allowed for an in-depth evaluation of the enrichment landscapes in CDR sequences and amino acid substitutions. Potent candidates were identified according to their high frequencies using NGS analysis, by-passing the need for the primary screening of target-binding clones. Furthermore, a subsequent library by recombination of the 10 most abundant variants from four CDRs was constructed and screened, and a mutant with 158-fold increased affinity (Kd = 25.5 pM) was obtained. These results suggest the potential application of the developed methodology for optimizing the binding properties of other antibodies and biomolecules.",

The limited library sequence diversity together with excessive redundancy and labour-consuming procedure for candidate identification are two major obstacles to widespread adoption of this technology. We hereby describe a novel library generation and screening approach to address the problems. The approach started with the targeted diversification of multiple complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of a humanized anti-ErbB2 antibody, HuA21, with a small perturbation mutagenesis strategy. A combination of three degenerate codons, NWG, NWC, and NSG, were chosen for amino acid saturation mutagenesis without introducing cysteine and stop residues. In total, 7,749 degenerate oligonucleotides were synthesized on two microchips and released to construct five single-chain antibody fragment (scFv) gene libraries with 4 x 106 DNA sequences. Deep sequencing of the unselected and selected phage libraries using the Illumina platform allowed for an in-depth evaluation of the enrichment landscapes in CDR sequences and amino acid substitutions. Potent candidates were identified according to their high frequencies using NGS analysis, by-passing the need for the primary screening of target-binding clones. Furthermore, a subsequent library by recombination of the 10 most abundant variants from four CDRs was constructed and screened, and a mutant with 158-fold increased affinity (Kd = 25.5 pM) was obtained. These results suggest the potential application of the developed methodology for optimizing the binding properties of other antibodies and biomolecules.\n## Generation and screening of combinatorial libraries\nTwo sets of combinatorial scFv phage libraries were generated and screened to explore the synergistic or additive potential of different CDRs.As the selection of the H3 library did not result in any beneficial mutants, only the identified mutants from the L1, L3, H1 and H2 libraries were chosen for mutational recombination.Affinity-enhancing CDR mutants identified through the target-binding screening method together with the wild-type CDR sequences were recombined to construct a first library with 4.5 x 10 4 theoretical diversity.Similarly, the top 10 most frequent CDR mutants identified through the NGS method were also recombined to construct a second library with 1.46 x 10 4 theoretical diversity.Two libraries were separately submitted to three rounds of panning using identically more stringent conditions by decreasing the antigen concentration and increasing the washing time.As expected, this process yielded a large number of clones with strong binding signals in phage ELISA.Several highly enriched scFv mutants from the second library were observed by Sanger sequencing of randomly picked clones.These scFv-Fc mutants were expressed and purified, and their antigen-binding kinetics were determined by surface plasmon resonance.(Table3).The affinity equilibrium constant (K d ) of these mutants was in the range of 25.5 to 295 pM.The most optimal variant displayed 158-fold improved affinity compared to HuA21.In this variant, the measured affinity is in good agreement with that apparent synergistic effect observed between different CDRs.Remarkably, the association (K on ) and dissociation (K off ) constants were both improved in all mutants.These results suggest that the NGS data were generally applicable for the construction of a small combinatorial library compassing multiple CDRs to significantly improve antibody affinity.\n\n## Discussion\nPhage or cell display systems are widely used for engineering antibodies with high affinity by stepwise optimization through interrogating and recombining beneficial mutations from multiple CDRs [7,8,[11][12][13].Here, we described a rational stepwise strategy for the effective optimization of HuA21 to obtain low picomolar affinities by phage display.In brief, the approach started with the construction of multiple SPM libraries to diversify antibody CDRs using massively microchip-synthesized degenerate oligonucleotides.Subsequently, Illumina sequencing was used to compare the unselected and selected scFv libraries to identify beneficial variants.Last, candidate mutations from several CDRs were recombined to generate a small size phage library that was further selected to isolate mutants with greatly improved affinity.\n\nThe method described in this study can improve the efficiency of CDR diversification.Many mutagenesis strategies have been applied in antibody affinity maturation, ranging from random mutagenesis across the complete gene sequence to targeted mutagenesis where the whole or hotspot positions in the CDR loops are diversified [2].Typically, small CDR regions with less than 6-8 aa can be targeted for saturation mutagenesis.However, for longer CDRs, this process becomes impractical due to the limitation in the phage library sizes (10 9 \u221210 12 ) that may be generated and surveyed with confidence.Furthermore, numerous studies have revealed that in most cases, amino acid substitutions in a few specific positions (typically no more than three or four) in the targeted CDR are sufficient to significantly improvement affinity.Here, Table 3.

The scFv clones were isolated from the phage display libraries by stringent panning, and their anti-proliferative activity against HER2-positive cancer cells was evaluated as a primary selection criterion. Consequently, we selected AH06 as a biobetter antibody that had a 7.2-fold increase in anti-proliferative activity (IC50: 0.81 nM) against the gastric cancer cell line NCI-N87 and a 7.4-fold increase in binding affinity (KD: 60 pM) to HER2 compared to hu4D5. The binding energy calculation and molecular modeling suggest that the substitution of residues of CDR-H3 to W98, F100c, A101 and L102 could stabilize binding of the antibody to HER2 and there could be direct hydrophobic interactions between the aromatic ring of W98 and the aliphatic group of I613 within HER2 domain IV as well as the heavy and light chain hydrophobic interactions by residues F100c, A101 and L102 of CDR-H3. Therefore, we speculate that two such interactions were exerted by the residues W98 and F100c. A101 and L102 may have a synergistic effect on the increase in the binding affinity to HER2. AH06 specifically binds to domain IV of HER2, and it decreased the phosphorylation level of HER2 and AKT. Above all, it highly increased the overall level of p27 compared to hu4D5 in the gastric cancer cell line NCI-N82, suggesting that AH06 could potentially be a more efficient therapeutic agent than hu4D5.",

The scFv clones were isolated from the phage display libraries by stringent panning, and their anti-proliferative activity against HER2-positive cancer cells was evaluated as a primary selection criterion. Consequently, we selected AH06 as a biobetter antibody that had a 7.2-fold increase in anti-proliferative activity (IC50: 0.81 nM) against the gastric cancer cell line NCI-N87 and a 7.4-fold increase in binding affinity (KD: 60 pM) to HER2 compared to hu4D5. The binding energy calculation and molecular modeling suggest that the substitution of residues of CDR-H3 to W98, F100c, A101 and L102 could stabilize binding of the antibody to HER2 and there could be direct hydrophobic interactions between the aromatic ring of W98 and the aliphatic group of I613 within HER2 domain IV as well as the heavy and light chain hydrophobic interactions by residues F100c, A101 and L102 of CDR-H3. Therefore, we speculate that two such interactions were exerted by the residues W98 and F100c. A101 and L102 may have a synergistic effect on the increase in the binding affinity to HER2. AH06 specifically binds to domain IV of HER2, and it decreased the phosphorylation level of HER2 and AKT. Above all, it highly increased the overall level of p27 compared to hu4D5 in the gastric cancer cell line NCI-N82, suggesting that AH06 could potentially be a more efficient therapeutic agent than hu4D5.\n## DISCUSSION\nAntibody affinity maturation by phage display is a highly efficient way of developing therapeutic antibodies (Lowe et al., 2012).

The success of antibody-based drugs resides in their exquisite specificity, high potency, stability, solubility, safety, and relatively inexpensive manufacturing process in comparison with other biologics. We outline here the structural studies and fundamental principles that define how antibodies interact with diverse targets. We also describe the antibody repertoires and affinity maturation mechanisms of humans, mice, and chickens, plus the use of novel single-domain antibodies in camelids and sharks. These species all utilize diverse evolutionary solutions to generate specific and high affinity antibodies and illustrate the plasticity of natural antibody repertoires. In addition, we discuss the multiple variations of man-made antibody repertoires designed and validated in the last two decades, which have served as tools to explore how the size, diversity, and composition of a repertoire impact the antibody discovery process.",

This repertoire design was highly effective in generating nM-affinity clones with specificity for a selection of proteins and peptides (Knappik et al., 2000;Marget et al., 2000). \n\nThe methods used by Knappik et al. (2000) have since been elaborated upon in a number of reports. Rothe et al. (2008), reported the construction of the next-generation library HuCal Gold\u2122 in which the design strategy was refined to change the CDR design complexity, the structural format of the library (to Fab fragment) and also to move to \"CysDisplay\" in which the expressed antibody is tethered to the phage via a disulphide bond with a mutant p3 protein. In this library, the CDR diversity was extended to the CDRs 1 and 2 of both V-domains, in addition to the CDR3s. The CDR cassettes were again based on trinucleotide technology and were built to accurately reflect the canonical structures and diversity found in the families upon which each of the consensus frameworks were built, consciously including structures known to be preferred in the recognition of peptides. The finalized library was found to be of very high practical utility, routinely generating antibody specificities and affinities in the single digit nM range that were useful for both therapeutic and reagent purposes (Jarutat et al., 2006(Jarutat et al., , 2007;;Ohara et al., 2006;Prassler et al., 2009). This library design had, however, made a critical concession to optimize its function in E. coli expression and phage display technology: the FRs were codon optimized specifically to maximize for E. coli periplasmic expression rate. In addition, this function had been aggressively selected for by pre-screening all antibody sequences for periplasmic transport as \u03b2-lactamase fusions before inclusion in the final library.",

Almagro\n## Abstract\nAntibodies are the fastest-growing segment of the biologics market. The success of antibody-based drugs resides in their exquisite specificity, high potency, stability, solubility, safety, and relatively inexpensive manufacturing process in comparison with other biologics. We outline here the structural studies and fundamental principles that define how antibodies interact with diverse targets. We also describe the antibody repertoires and affinity maturation mechanisms of humans, mice, and chickens, plus the use of novel single-domain antibodies in camelids and sharks. These species all utilize diverse evolutionary solutions to generate specific and high affinity antibodies and illustrate the plasticity of natural antibody repertoires. In addition, we discuss the multiple variations of man-made antibody repertoires designed and validated in the last two decades, which have served as tools to explore how the size, diversity, and composition of a repertoire impact the antibody discovery process.\n## SYNTHETIC REPERTOIRES\nStem loop biases in both the CDRs H3 and L3 were also closely maintained and limited diversity was introduced at several key positions in the structurally conserved V\u03ba and V\u03bb L3 loops. This repertoire design was highly effective in generating nM-affinity clones with specificity for a selection of proteins and peptides (Knappik et al., 2000;Marget et al., 2000). \n\nThe methods used by Knappik et al. (2000) have since been elaborated upon in a number of reports. Rothe et al. (2008), reported the construction of the next-generation library HuCal Gold\u2122 in which the design strategy was refined to change the CDR design complexity, the structural format of the library (to Fab fragment) and also to move to \"CysDisplay\" in which the expressed antibody is tethered to the phage via a disulphide bond with a mutant p3 protein. In this library, the CDR diversity was extended to the CDRs 1 and 2 of both V-domains, in addition to the CDR3s. The CDR cassettes were again based on trinucleotide technology and were built to accurately reflect the canonical structures and diversity found in the families upon which each of the consensus frameworks were built, consciously including structures known to be preferred in the recognition of peptides. The finalized library was found to be of very high practical utility, routinely generating antibody specificities and affinities in the single digit nM range that were useful for both therapeutic and reagent purposes (Jarutat et al., 2006(Jarutat et al., , 2007;;Ohara et al., 2006;Prassler et al., 2009). This library design had, however, made a critical concession to optimize its function in E. coli expression and phage display technology: the FRs were codon optimized specifically to maximize for E. coli periplasmic expression rate. In addition, this function had been aggressively selected for by pre-screening all antibody sequences for periplasmic transport as \u03b2-lactamase fusions before inclusion in the final library.",

However, most antibodies are isolated from semi-synthetic libraries by phage display and do not possess in vivo affinity maturation, which is triggered by antigen immunization. It is therefore necessary to engineer the affinity of these antibodies by way of in vitro assaying. In this study, we optimized the affinity of two human monoclonal antibodies which were isolated by phage display in a previous related study.

During development, initial leads routinely undergo additional engineering to increase their target affinity. Experimental methods for affinity maturation are expensive, laborious, and time-consuming and rarely allow the efficient exploration of the relevant design space. Deep learning (DL) models are transforming the field of protein engineering and design. While several DL-based protein design methods have shown promise, the antibody design problem is distinct, and specialized models for antibody design are desirable. Inspired by hallucination frameworks that leverage accurate structure prediction DL models, we propose the FvHallucinator for designing antibody sequences, especially the CDR loops, conditioned on an antibody structure. Such a strategy generates targeted CDR libraries that retain the conformation of the binder and thereby the mode of binding to the epitope on the antigen. On a benchmark set of 60 antibodies, FvHallucinator generates sequences resembling natural CDRs and recapitulates perplexity of canonical CDR clusters. Furthermore, the FvHallucinator designs amino acid substitutions at the VH-VL interface that are enriched in human antibody repertoires and therapeutic antibodies. We propose a pipeline that screens FvHallucinator designs to obtain a library enriched in binders for an antigen of interest. We apply this pipeline to the CDR H3 of the Trastuzumab-HER2 complex to generate in silico designs improving upon the binding affinity and interfacial properties of the original antibody. Thus, the FvHallucinator pipeline enables generation of inexpensive, diverse, and targeted antibody libraries enriched in binders for antibody affinity maturation.",

The CDRs leverage a vast sequence space to target the immensely diverse range of antigens that challenge the immune system. CDR diversity results from V(D)J gene recombination prior to antigen exposure followed by somatic hypermutation after antigen exposure (1). Hence, antibodies achieve the ability to target a diverse range of epitopes by both diversifying the CDR sequences prior to antigen exposure and by antigen-specific hypermutation post antigenic exposure. The process of evolution of an antibody to bind an antigen with higher affinity and specificity is known as affinity maturation.\n\nIn the laboratory, affinity maturation is achieved broadly in two steps. First, large libraries of CDR regions are diversified via methods such as random mutagenesis, targeted mutagenesis, and chain shuffling. Second, the libraries are screened for expression and binding through display technologies such as yeast or phage display. These steps are repeated until enough \"hits\" are found with the desired affinity. Such approaches to affinity maturation can be expensive and time-consuming, and rarely allow the efficient exploration of the full design space (2). Computational methods offer faster and inexpensive alternatives to experimental affinity maturation. Conventional computational approaches for antibody design or affinity maturation include rational or structure-guided design strategies (3,4), general protein design methods such as FastDesign (5), and antibody-specific design methods such as AbDesign (6) and RosettaAntibodyDesign (7) (RAbD). RAbD is notable because it allows the design of CDR sequences and conformations in the context of the antigen. However, RAbD requires 10-20 hours for a single design. Further, RAbD only samples CDR sequences from PyIgClassify (8) clusters that have arbitrary classification cutoffs and are context (surrounding residues) agnostic. Further, Rosetta (like other methods) has challenges in accurate modeling of CDR H3 (9).\n\nDeep learning (DL) models are transforming the field",

Ruffolo, Rahel Frick, Jeffrey J. Gray\n## Abstract\nAntibodies are widely developed and used as therapeutics to treat cancer, infectious disease, and inflammation. During development, initial leads routinely undergo additional engineering to increase their target affinity. Experimental methods for affinity maturation are expensive, laborious, and time-consuming and rarely allow the efficient exploration of the relevant design space. Deep learning (DL) models are transforming the field of protein engineering and design. While several DL-based protein design methods have shown promise, the antibody design problem is distinct, and specialized models for antibody design are desirable. Inspired by hallucination frameworks that leverage accurate structure prediction DL models, we propose the FvHallucinator for designing antibody sequences, especially the CDR loops, conditioned on an antibody structure. Such a strategy generates targeted CDR libraries that retain the conformation of the binder and thereby the mode of binding to the epitope on the antigen. On a benchmark set of 60 antibodies, FvHallucinator generates sequences resembling natural CDRs and recapitulates perplexity of canonical CDR clusters. Furthermore, the FvHallucinator designs amino acid substitutions at the VH-VL interface that are enriched in human antibody repertoires and therapeutic antibodies. We propose a pipeline that screens FvHallucinator designs to obtain a library enriched in binders for an antigen of interest. We apply this pipeline to the CDR H3 of the Trastuzumab-HER2 complex to generate in silico designs improving upon the binding affinity and interfacial properties of the original antibody. Thus, the FvHallucinator pipeline enables generation of inexpensive, diverse, and targeted antibody libraries enriched in binders for antibody affinity maturation.\n## Introduction\nAntibodies recognize and bind an extremely large repertoire of antigens via six hypervariable loop regions (H1, H2, H3, L1, L2, L3) in their variable domain (F v ) known as the complementarity determining regions (CDRs). The CDRs leverage a vast sequence space to target the immensely diverse range of antigens that challenge the immune system. CDR diversity results from V(D)J gene recombination prior to antigen exposure followed by somatic hypermutation after antigen exposure (1). Hence, antibodies achieve the ability to target a diverse range of epitopes by both diversifying the CDR sequences prior to antigen exposure and by antigen-specific hypermutation post antigenic exposure. The process of evolution of an antibody to bind an antigen with higher affinity and specificity is known as affinity maturation.\n\nIn the laboratory, affinity maturation is achieved broadly in two steps. First, large libraries of CDR regions are diversified via methods such as random mutagenesis, targeted mutagenesis, and chain shuffling. Second, the libraries are screened for expression and binding through display technologies such as yeast or phage display. These steps are repeated until enough \"hits\" are found with the desired affinity. Such approaches to affinity maturation can be expensive and time-consuming, and rarely allow the efficient exploration of the full design space (2). Computational methods offer faster and inexpensive alternatives to experimental affinity maturation. Conventional computational approaches for antibody design or affinity maturation include rational or structure-guided design strategies (3,4), general protein design methods such as FastDesign (5), and antibody-specific design methods such as AbDesign (6) and RosettaAntibodyDesign (7) (RAbD). RAbD is notable because it allows the design of CDR sequences and conformations in the context of the antigen. However, RAbD requires 10-20 hours for a single design. Further, RAbD only samples CDR sequences from PyIgClassify (8) clusters that have arbitrary classification cutoffs and are context (surrounding residues) agnostic. Further, Rosetta (like other methods) has challenges in accurate modeling of CDR H3 (9).\n\nDeep learning (DL) models are transforming the field",

            "abstract": "Because of its great potential for diversity, the immunoglobulin heavy-chain complementarity-determining region 3 (HCDR3) is taken as an antibody molecule\u2019s most important component in conferring binding activity and specificity. For this reason, HCDR3s have been used as unique identifiers to investigate adaptive immune responses in vivo and to characterize in vitro selection outputs where display systems were employed. Here, we show that many different HCDR3s can be identified within a target-specific antibody population after in vitro selection. For each identified HCDR3, a number of different antibodies bearing differences elsewhere can be found. In such selected populations, all antibodies with the same HCDR3 recognize the target, albeit at different affinities. In contrast, within unselected populations, the majority of antibodies with the same HCDR3 sequence do not bind the target. In one HCDR3 examined in depth, all target-specific antibodies were derived from the same VDJ rearrangement, while non-binding antibodies with the same HCDR3 were derived from many different V and D gene rearrangements. Careful examination of previously published in vivo datasets reveals that HCDR3s shared between, and within, different individuals can also originate from rearrangements of different V and D genes, with up to 26 different rearrangements yielding the same identical HCDR3 sequence. On the basis of these observations, we conclude that the same HCDR3 can be generated by many different rearrangements, but that specific target binding is an outcome of unique rearrangements and VL pairing: the HCDR3 is necessary, albeit insufficient, for specific antibody binding.",

CDRs 1 and 2 are encoded by germline V genes, while CDR3s in both VH and VL are the product of gene recombination. Compared to other CDRs, the varied length and biochemical properties of heavy-chain complementarity-determining region 3 (HCDR3) contribute to enhanced sequence diversity (1). It has been estimated (2) that the theoretical HCDR3 diversity exceeds 10 15 variants, generated from fixed genomic sequences by combinatorial and junctional diversification mechanisms. This underlies the vast diversity of the human antibody repertoire. The fully assembled V(D)J gene and its incorporated HCDR3 are derived from the sequential random assembly of 56 VH, 23 DH, and 6 JH genes (3)(4)(5)(6). While both VH and JH contribute to the HCDR3, the DH forms the central core. Although DH genes are predominantly read in one frame, all three frames can be used (7,8), further increasing potential diversity. It was initially thought that D genes could also be inverted and duplicated (9,10); however, recent deep sequencing results indicate that this is unlikely (7). Diversity is further increased by P-nucleotide-mediated (11) or N-nucleotide-mediated (12,13) addition, or exonuclease-mediated loss (11,14), of nucleotides between the VH/DH and DH/JH segments. Recombination between VH genes after rearrangement provides further diversification although it remains unclear how much this contributes overall (15). \n\nThere is much evidence that the HCDR3 is the major determinant of antibody-binding specificity. Specific antibodies have been selected from synthetic antibody libraries where diversity is restricted to the HCDR3 (16)(17)(18). It has been shown that a greater number of antibodies were selected from a synthetic library containing only HCDR3 diversity than when the same library was combined with LCDR3 diversity (18).",

D\u2019Angelo, F. Ferrara, L. Naranjo, M. F. Erasmus, P. Hraber, A. R. Bradbury\n## Abstract\nBecause of its great potential for diversity, the immunoglobulin heavy-chain complementarity-determining region 3 (HCDR3) is taken as an antibody molecule\u2019s most important component in conferring binding activity and specificity. For this reason, HCDR3s have been used as unique identifiers to investigate adaptive immune responses in vivo and to characterize in vitro selection outputs where display systems were employed. Here, we show that many different HCDR3s can be identified within a target-specific antibody population after in vitro selection. For each identified HCDR3, a number of different antibodies bearing differences elsewhere can be found. In such selected populations, all antibodies with the same HCDR3 recognize the target, albeit at different affinities. In contrast, within unselected populations, the majority of antibodies with the same HCDR3 sequence do not bind the target. In one HCDR3 examined in depth, all target-specific antibodies were derived from the same VDJ rearrangement, while non-binding antibodies with the same HCDR3 were derived from many different V and D gene rearrangements. Careful examination of previously published in vivo datasets reveals that HCDR3s shared between, and within, different individuals can also originate from rearrangements of different V and D genes, with up to 26 different rearrangements yielding the same identical HCDR3 sequence. On the basis of these observations, we conclude that the same HCDR3 can be generated by many different rearrangements, but that specific target binding is an outcome of unique rearrangements and VL pairing: the HCDR3 is necessary, albeit insufficient, for specific antibody binding.\n## inTrODUcTiOn\nAntibodies bind their targets using diversified loops, termed complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), with three in each rearranged VH and VL gene. CDRs 1 and 2 are encoded by germline V genes, while CDR3s in both VH and VL are the product of gene recombination. Compared to other CDRs, the varied length and biochemical properties of heavy-chain complementarity-determining region 3 (HCDR3) contribute to enhanced sequence diversity (1). It has been estimated (2) that the theoretical HCDR3 diversity exceeds 10 15 variants, generated from fixed genomic sequences by combinatorial and junctional diversification mechanisms. This underlies the vast diversity of the human antibody repertoire. The fully assembled V(D)J gene and its incorporated HCDR3 are derived from the sequential random assembly of 56 VH, 23 DH, and 6 JH genes (3)(4)(5)(6). While both VH and JH contribute to the HCDR3, the DH forms the central core. Although DH genes are predominantly read in one frame, all three frames can be used (7,8), further increasing potential diversity. It was initially thought that D genes could also be inverted and duplicated (9,10); however, recent deep sequencing results indicate that this is unlikely (7). Diversity is further increased by P-nucleotide-mediated (11) or N-nucleotide-mediated (12,13) addition, or exonuclease-mediated loss (11,14), of nucleotides between the VH/DH and DH/JH segments. Recombination between VH genes after rearrangement provides further diversification although it remains unclear how much this contributes overall (15). \n\nThere is much evidence that the HCDR3 is the major determinant of antibody-binding specificity. Specific antibodies have been selected from synthetic antibody libraries where diversity is restricted to the HCDR3 (16)(17)(18). It has been shown that a greater number of antibodies were selected from a synthetic library containing only HCDR3 diversity than when the same library was combined with LCDR3 diversity (18).",

            "abstract": "Background Complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) are immunoglobulin (Ig) hypervariable domains that determine specific antibody (Ab) binding. We have shown that synthetic CDR-related peptides and many decapeptides spanning the variable region of a recombinant yeast killer toxin-like antiidiotypic Ab are candidacidal in vitro. An alanine-substituted decapeptide from the variable region of this Ab displayed increased cytotoxicity in vitro and/or therapeutic effects in vivo against various bacteria, fungi, protozoa and viruses. The possibility that isolated CDRs, represented by short synthetic peptides, may display antimicrobial, antiviral and antitumor activities irrespective of Ab specificity for a given antigen is addressed here. Methodology/Principal Findings CDR-based synthetic peptides of murine and human monoclonal Abs directed to: a) a protein epitope of Candida albicans cell wall stress mannoprotein; b) a synthetic peptide containing well-characterized B-cell and T-cell epitopes; c) a carbohydrate blood group A substance, showed differential inhibitory activities in vitro, ex vivo and/or in vivo against C. albicans, HIV-1 and B16F10-Nex2 melanoma cells, conceivably involving different mechanisms of action. Antitumor activities involved peptide-induced caspase-dependent apoptosis. Engineered peptides, obtained by alanine substitution of Ig CDR sequences, and used as surrogates of natural point mutations, showed further differential increased/unaltered/decreased antimicrobial, antiviral and/or antitumor activities. The inhibitory effects observed were largely independent of the specificity of the native Ab and involved chiefly germline encoded CDR1 and CDR2 of light and heavy chains. Conclusions/Significance The high frequency of bioactive peptides based on CDRs suggests that Ig molecules are sources of an unlimited number of sequences potentially active against infectious agents and tumor cells. The easy production and low cost of small sized synthetic peptides representing Ig CDRs and the possibility of peptide engineering and chemical optimization associated to new delivery mechanisms are expected to give rise to a new generation of therapeutic agents.",

                    "text": "CDR sequences in the variable regions of immunoglobulins are thought to act cooperatively in the recognition of an antigen. Among them, CDR H3 is at the center of antigen recognition, but the other five CDRs are more or less involved for increased binding affinity to the antigen and some contact residues can even be located within framework regions [17]. The observation that Ab specificity is determined by a limited number of residues has allowed the synthesis of small peptides based on CDRs which retain binding properties and functions of the intact Ab [18,19]. Diversity of CDR1 and CDR2 is encoded by the germline and further modified by somatic mutation; that of CDR L3 and CDR H3 arises somatically by rearrangement of the V segment with the JL or DH and JH segments, respectively. \n\nIsolated CDR sequences, frequently CDR H3, showed the same specificity of the native Ab and were called micro(mini)antibodies [20,21]. Diversity of CDR H3 is sufficient to allow otherwise identical IgM molecules to distinguish between a variety of haptens and protein antigens [22]. It has even been postulated that diverse CDR3 loops represent a highly antigen specific recognition core whereas other CDRs bind opportunistically [23]. Recently, a tyrosine-sulfated peptide derived from CDR H3 of an HIV-1neutralizing Ab was shown to bind gp120 and inhibit HIV-1 infection [24]. Apart from the microantibodies that may display anti-viral [25] and antitumor [26] activities as does the native Ab, less is known about the biological activities of other CDR and framework sequences tested as isolated peptides. Some CDR and framework region-derived peptides, however, have been described as inhibitors of receptor-ligand interactions, cell adhesion and of microbial or viral infections [5,27]. Several peptides including amino acids from the CDRs of anti-CD4 mAb ST40 and framework residues flanking the CDRs bound to soluble CD4 and displaced Ab binding [28]. Bioactive paratope-derived peptides of potential pharmacological interest were also deduced by hydropathic complementarity [29].",

Polonelli, J. Ponto\u0301n, N. Elguezabal, M. Moragues, C. Casoli, E. Pilotti, P. Ronzi, A. Dobroff, E. G. Rodrigues, M. Juliano, D. L. Maffei, W. Magliani, S. Conti, L. Travassos\n## Abstract\nBackground Complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) are immunoglobulin (Ig) hypervariable domains that determine specific antibody (Ab) binding. We have shown that synthetic CDR-related peptides and many decapeptides spanning the variable region of a recombinant yeast killer toxin-like antiidiotypic Ab are candidacidal in vitro. An alanine-substituted decapeptide from the variable region of this Ab displayed increased cytotoxicity in vitro and/or therapeutic effects in vivo against various bacteria, fungi, protozoa and viruses. The possibility that isolated CDRs, represented by short synthetic peptides, may display antimicrobial, antiviral and antitumor activities irrespective of Ab specificity for a given antigen is addressed here. Methodology/Principal Findings CDR-based synthetic peptides of murine and human monoclonal Abs directed to: a) a protein epitope of Candida albicans cell wall stress mannoprotein; b) a synthetic peptide containing well-characterized B-cell and T-cell epitopes; c) a carbohydrate blood group A substance, showed differential inhibitory activities in vitro, ex vivo and/or in vivo against C. albicans, HIV-1 and B16F10-Nex2 melanoma cells, conceivably involving different mechanisms of action. Antitumor activities involved peptide-induced caspase-dependent apoptosis. Engineered peptides, obtained by alanine substitution of Ig CDR sequences, and used as surrogates of natural point mutations, showed further differential increased/unaltered/decreased antimicrobial, antiviral and/or antitumor activities. The inhibitory effects observed were largely independent of the specificity of the native Ab and involved chiefly germline encoded CDR1 and CDR2 of light and heavy chains. Conclusions/Significance The high frequency of bioactive peptides based on CDRs suggests that Ig molecules are sources of an unlimited number of sequences potentially active against infectious agents and tumor cells. The easy production and low cost of small sized synthetic peptides representing Ig CDRs and the possibility of peptide engineering and chemical optimization associated to new delivery mechanisms are expected to give rise to a new generation of therapeutic agents.\n## Discussion\nCDR sequences in the variable regions of immunoglobulins are thought to act cooperatively in the recognition of an antigen. Among them, CDR H3 is at the center of antigen recognition, but the other five CDRs are more or less involved for increased binding affinity to the antigen and some contact residues can even be located within framework regions [17]. The observation that Ab specificity is determined by a limited number of residues has allowed the synthesis of small peptides based on CDRs which retain binding properties and functions of the intact Ab [18,19]. Diversity of CDR1 and CDR2 is encoded by the germline and further modified by somatic mutation; that of CDR L3 and CDR H3 arises somatically by rearrangement of the V segment with the JL or DH and JH segments, respectively. \n\nIsolated CDR sequences, frequently CDR H3, showed the same specificity of the native Ab and were called micro(mini)antibodies [20,21]. Diversity of CDR H3 is sufficient to allow otherwise identical IgM molecules to distinguish between a variety of haptens and protein antigens [22]. It has even been postulated that diverse CDR3 loops represent a highly antigen specific recognition core whereas other CDRs bind opportunistically [23]. Recently, a tyrosine-sulfated peptide derived from CDR H3 of an HIV-1neutralizing Ab was shown to bind gp120 and inhibit HIV-1 infection [24]. Apart from the microantibodies that may display anti-viral [25] and antitumor [26] activities as does the native Ab, less is known about the biological activities of other CDR and framework sequences tested as isolated peptides. Some CDR and framework region-derived peptides, however, have been described as inhibitors of receptor-ligand interactions, cell adhesion and of microbial or viral infections [5,27]. Several peptides including amino acids from the CDRs of anti-CD4 mAb ST40 and framework residues flanking the CDRs bound to soluble CD4 and displaced Ab binding [28]. Bioactive paratope-derived peptides of potential pharmacological interest were also deduced by hydropathic complementarity [29].",

Such plasticity can be exploited to generate human antibody libraries featuring hallmarks of these diverse repertoires. In this study, the focus was to capture CDRH3 sequences, as this region generally accounts for most of the interaction energy with antigen. Sequences from human as well as non-human sources were successfully integrated into human antibody libraries. Next generation sequencing of these libraries proved that the CDRH3 lengths and amino acid composition corresponded to the species of origin. Specific CDRH3 sequences, biased towards the recognition of a model antigen either by immunizing mice or by selecting with phage display, were then integrated into another set of libraries. From these antigen biased libraries, highly potent antibodies were more frequently isolated, indicating that the characteristics of an immune repertoire is transferrable via CDRH3 sequences into a human antibody library. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the properties of naturally or experimentally biased repertoires can be effectively harnessed for the generation of targeted human antibody libraries, substantially increasing the probability of isolating antibodies suitable for therapeutic and diagnostic applications.",

In this way, the benefit of using stable frameworks and CDR sequences that have been proofread in another repertoire can be combined for improved library functionality. \n\nIt has been demonstrated that even small antibody libraries constructed by combinatorial assembly of heavy and light chain variable regions derived from immunized animals facilitate the isolation of specific antibodies against the antigen used as immunogen [8], [20]. This is explained by the fact that recombining a VH and VL repertoire enriched for antigen specific sequences leads to more frequent productive combinations in the library and, thus, increased hit rates and binding affinities. In contrast, naive repertoires based on assembly of variable genes from naive sources, need to be of a much larger size (.10 9 ) in order to have reasonable chances of success [41]. \n\nWe reasoned that by capturing the central element of diversity of a biased antibody repertoire and grafting it into a novel antibody library, we could transfer its target specificity. This hypothesis was demonstrated using two independent sources of biased CDRH3 sequences. First, three libraries incorporating CDRH3 isolated from naive or immunized mice were used for phage display selections. These libraries had identical characteristics in terms of variable gene family content but led to significantly different performances both in term of hit rate and target binding capacity of the purified antibody fragments. This first approach demonstrated that for two model antigens, hIFNc and hIL6 receptor, the target specificity of an in vivo biased repertoire could be transferred via its CDRH3 content. \n\nWe extended and confirmed these finding by using as a source of CDRH3 sequences, the output of a third round of phage selection against hIFNc. Despite its smaller size, the biased library more frequently generated clones having higher binding capacity against hIFNc compared to a larger naive library. Libraries especially designed to address a certain class of antigen have been difficult to generate and only few examples have reported for instance against haptens [42]. Clones were then ranked according to their level of absorbance at 450 nm.",

In addition, the sequences encoding immunoglobulins that recombine during B cell development to generate functional antibodies differ between species. Several studies have shown that CDR sequences of non-human origin can be used to generate humanized antibodies [36], [37], [38]. The aim of our study was to isolate and capture the features of immunoglobulin repertoires from different species or from B cell populations that have been biased in response to antigens and incorporate these features into human antibody libraries. We developed a generic approach to retrieve CDRH3 sequences from different sources and clone them into selected human antibody frameworks using type IIS restriction cloning that avoids modification of the antibody coding sequence either in the CDRs or in the antibody framework regions. Although applicable to any CDR, we focused on the CDR3 of the heavy chain as it is the most diversified region of an antibody and in many cases contributes to most of the antigen binding energy [28], [29]. \n\nFive phage antibody libraries were constructed by capturing CDRH3 sequences from human healthy donors or mice that were either naive or immunized with different antigens. We then analyzed these libraries by NGS which is a powerful method to extensively characterize such large repertoires [33], [35]. The analysis showed that the new libraries contained CDRH3 having length and amino acid compositions typical of murine or human CDRH3 sequences, demonstrating that CDR capture enables the generation of human antibody libraries that probe three dimensional space differently. This might allow taking advantage of long CDR loops found in camelid VHH or shark V-NAR domains that are much better suited to target cavities such as enzyme active sites or difficult to access epitopes in canyons of viruses [39], [40]. Furthermore, by cloning CDR sequences into selected frameworks, the probability of generating a functional antibody in the new context is higher compared to the use of synthetically diversified CDRs that frequently lead to non-functional antibodies that cannot fold properly.",

Ravn, V. Buatois, F. Gueneau, S\u00e9bastien Calloud, M. Kosco-Vilbois, N. Fischer\n## Abstract\nAntibody repertoires are characterized by diversity as they vary not only amongst individuals and post antigen exposure but also differ significantly between vertebrate species. Such plasticity can be exploited to generate human antibody libraries featuring hallmarks of these diverse repertoires. In this study, the focus was to capture CDRH3 sequences, as this region generally accounts for most of the interaction energy with antigen. Sequences from human as well as non-human sources were successfully integrated into human antibody libraries. Next generation sequencing of these libraries proved that the CDRH3 lengths and amino acid composition corresponded to the species of origin. Specific CDRH3 sequences, biased towards the recognition of a model antigen either by immunizing mice or by selecting with phage display, were then integrated into another set of libraries. From these antigen biased libraries, highly potent antibodies were more frequently isolated, indicating that the characteristics of an immune repertoire is transferrable via CDRH3 sequences into a human antibody library. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the properties of naturally or experimentally biased repertoires can be effectively harnessed for the generation of targeted human antibody libraries, substantially increasing the probability of isolating antibodies suitable for therapeutic and diagnostic applications.\n## Discussion\nImmunoglobulin repertoires are very plastic and B cells populations constantly evolve in response to different pathogens and other stimuli. In addition, the sequences encoding immunoglobulins that recombine during B cell development to generate functional antibodies differ between species. Several studies have shown that CDR sequences of non-human origin can be used to generate humanized antibodies [36], [37], [38]. The aim of our study was to isolate and capture the features of immunoglobulin repertoires from different species or from B cell populations that have been biased in response to antigens and incorporate these features into human antibody libraries. We developed a generic approach to retrieve CDRH3 sequences from different sources and clone them into selected human antibody frameworks using type IIS restriction cloning that avoids modification of the antibody coding sequence either in the CDRs or in the antibody framework regions. Although applicable to any CDR, we focused on the CDR3 of the heavy chain as it is the most diversified region of an antibody and in many cases contributes to most of the antigen binding energy [28], [29]. \n\nFive phage antibody libraries were constructed by capturing CDRH3 sequences from human healthy donors or mice that were either naive or immunized with different antigens. We then analyzed these libraries by NGS which is a powerful method to extensively characterize such large repertoires [33], [35]. The analysis showed that the new libraries contained CDRH3 having length and amino acid compositions typical of murine or human CDRH3 sequences, demonstrating that CDR capture enables the generation of human antibody libraries that probe three dimensional space differently. This might allow taking advantage of long CDR loops found in camelid VHH or shark V-NAR domains that are much better suited to target cavities such as enzyme active sites or difficult to access epitopes in canyons of viruses [39], [40]. Furthermore, by cloning CDR sequences into selected frameworks, the probability of generating a functional antibody in the new context is higher compared to the use of synthetically diversified CDRs that frequently lead to non-functional antibodies that cannot fold properly.\n...\nFurthermore, by cloning CDR sequences into selected frameworks, the probability of generating a functional antibody in the new context is higher compared to the use of synthetically diversified CDRs that frequently lead to non-functional antibodies that cannot fold properly. In this way, the benefit of using stable frameworks and CDR sequences that have been proofread in another repertoire can be combined for improved library functionality. \n\nIt has been demonstrated that even small antibody libraries constructed by combinatorial assembly of heavy and light chain variable regions derived from immunized animals facilitate the isolation of specific antibodies against the antigen used as immunogen [8], [20]. This is explained by the fact that recombining a VH and VL repertoire enriched for antigen specific sequences leads to more frequent productive combinations in the library and, thus, increased hit rates and binding affinities. In contrast, naive repertoires based on assembly of variable genes from naive sources, need to be of a much larger size (.10 9 ) in order to have reasonable chances of success [41]. \n\nWe reasoned that by capturing the central element of diversity of a biased antibody repertoire and grafting it into a novel antibody library, we could transfer its target specificity. This hypothesis was demonstrated using two independent sources of biased CDRH3 sequences. First, three libraries incorporating CDRH3 isolated from naive or immunized mice were used for phage display selections. These libraries had identical characteristics in terms of variable gene family content but led to significantly different performances both in term of hit rate and target binding capacity of the purified antibody fragments. This first approach demonstrated that for two model antigens, hIFNc and hIL6 receptor, the target specificity of an in vivo biased repertoire could be transferred via its CDRH3 content. \n\nWe extended and confirmed these finding by using as a source of CDRH3 sequences, the output of a third round of phage selection against hIFNc. Despite its smaller size, the biased library more frequently generated clones having higher binding capacity against hIFNc compared to a larger naive library. Libraries especially designed to address a certain class of antigen have been difficult to generate and only few examples have reported for instance against haptens [42]. Clones were then ranked according to their level of absorbance at 450 nm.",

Following the natural antibody tendency favoring the highest variability and paratope involvement in L3 and H3 CDRs, most sAB libraries that have only H3 and L3 diversified and just one of the canonical natural sequences incorporated in place of each of other four CDRs, proved to be very efficient [73,75,76]; however, some high quality libraries have all six CDRs diversified [72,77,78]. Surprisingly, the minimalist libraries, con taining sequences of only two residues, Tyr and Ser, in their CDRs, were proven highly effective in generating specific antibodies against a wide array of antigens pro viding a rationale for high abundance of these two residues in the CDRs of the natural immune reper toire [62,79]. Due to the simpler design, these libraries are relatively easy to construct, and, due to the smaller theoretical size, they possess higher sampling power. Involvement of more of CDRs and CDR positions into deeper diversification, while producing an exponentially increasing number of possible variants, allows to build more enhanced and sterically extended paratopes with higher conformational diversity, thus, facilitating efficient recognition of various epitopes of different types of anti gens. \n\nAs was mentioned above, natural antibody libraries have a huge advantage over any sAB library since they contain only expressible and stable CDR variants that have passed multiple control points of the immune sys tem. In addition, chemical synthesis of CDRs is inher ently compromised by synthetic errors, introducing all sorts of mutations that generate unwanted amino acid substitutions and stop codons resulting in nonfunctional antibody clones [72,77] To eliminate poorly expressed clones and non productive frame shifts, a proofreading step, such as selection of ampicillin resistant sAB -\u03b2 lactamase genetic fusions, has been added as the final step of library construction [77].",

The latter include six complementarity determining regions (CDRs) which constitute the antigen (Ag) binding-site. The structural repertoires and the relationships between amino acid sequences and tertiary structures have been extensively studied to reveal the importance of the typical loops, which are canonical structures in the three CDR segments belonging to the light chain (Ll, L2, and L3) as well as the first two CDR segments of the heavy chain (Hl and H2) [1]. The third CDR of the heavy chain (H3) displays wide variety in its length and amino acid sequence, and no canonical structures have ever been established for it [1,2,3]. Variety of CDR1 and CDR2 is encoded by the germline and furtherly diversified by somatic mutation while the one of CDR L3 and CDR H3 is somatically generated by rearrangement of the variable (V) segment with the joining (J) L or diversity (D) H and JH segments, respectively. Notably, CDR H3 plays a crucial role in mediating individual Ag recognition, sometimes by changing its conformation upon Ag binding [4], although the other five CDRs are also more or less implicated in increasing binding affinity to Ag and some contact residues can even be situated within framework of variable regions [5]. \n\nThe observation that Ab specificity is determined by a limited number of residues has prompted the synthesis of small peptides based on CDR sequences which retain binding properties and functions of the intact Ab [6,7]. \n\nIn previous studies it has been demonstrated that the CDRs, or related peptidic fragments, of a recombinant single chain Ab (scFv), representing the internal image of a wide antimicrobial spectrum Pichia anomala killer toxin (KT), may exert a specific microbicidal activity in vitro against KT-sensitive microorganisms characterized by specific cell-wall receptors mainly constituted by 1,3-b-glucans [8].",

Installing charge mutations at both CH1/CL interfaces was sufficient for near quantitative yield (>90%) of BsIgG1 for most (9 of 11) antibody pairs tested with this inherent cognate chain pairing preference. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that a strong cognate pairing preference in one Fab arm can be sufficient for high BsIgG1 yield. These observed chain pairing preferences are apparently driven by variable domain sequences and can result from a few specific residues in the complementarity-determining region (CDR) L3 and H3. Transfer of these CDR residues into other antibodies increased BsIgG1 yield in most cases. Mutational analysis revealed that the disulfide bond between heavy and light chains did not affect the yield of BsIgG1.

The most critical parameter for all in vitro-based approaches is the quality of the antibody library. Concurrent evolution of the libraries has allowed display and selection technologies to reveal their full potential. They come in different flavors, from na\u00efve to fully synthetic and differ in terms of size, quality, method of preparation, framework and CDR composition. Early on, the focus has mainly been on affinities and thus on library size and diversity. Subsequently, the increased awareness of developability and cost of goods as important success factors has spurred efforts to generate libraries with improved biophysical properties and favorable production characteristics. More recently a major focus on reduction of unwanted side effects through reduced immunogenicity and improved overall biophysical behavior has led to a re-evaluation of library design.",

                    "text": "Over the past 15 years the generation of therapeutic antibodies from combinatorial antibody libraries has been established as a valid alternative to conventional immunization. To isolate candidates from such libraries the antibodies or antibody fragments are displayed on the surface of cells, phages, ribosomes or within the cell. Among those display methods, phage display has the longest history and it is among the technologies most commonly used today. While the choice of the antibody format can be limited by the display method, e.g., to the scFv or the Fab in the case of phage display, library design is in principle independent, as long as sufficient expression properties in the respective host system are ensured. \n\nCombinatorial antibody libraries differ in design, origin of sequence diversity and method of generation. All three aspects have an impact on the most essential features of a library: its size and functional diversity reflected in the ability to deliver high affinity antibodies with good biophysical properties. Antibody libraries can be classified into three major groups: na\u00efve, semi-synthetic and synthetic libraries. Most libraries aim at maximizing library diversity, but differ in their approaches of maximizing functional size and subsequent developability of the selected molecules. Limitation to a single stable framework or to a selected number of consensus frameworks to ensure good biophysical properties is one trend in this context. Currently there is a trend to be as close to human germline as possible, both in the choice of framework and CDR composition, to avoid potential issues of immunogenicity. \n\nWith the synthetic library of moderate size described by Pini and coworkers, scFvs were selected with monovalent affinities down to 10 nM [57]. Affinities achieved with large semi-synthetic libraries described by Hoet and S\u00f6derlind reached the sub-nanomolar range, whereas antibodies in the lower picomolar range have been isolated directly from the fully synthetic HuCAL PLATINUM \u00ae library as well as the very large na\u00efve CAT2.0 library. Affinity improvement factors vary widely within each method and are highly dependent on both the antigen as well as the starting molecule. The approaches targeting CDR regions have advantages concerning functional size of maturation libraries and integrity of antibody framework.",

Different library generations were described and it could be shown that the restricted diversity in CDR-H1 and CDR-H2 improved the performance of the library whereas highly variable CDR-H3 sequences were advantageous. Affinities in the low nanomolar range were achieved using these libraries. \n\nHoet and coworkers at Dyax combined synthetic diversity in CDR-H1 and -H2 with length and sequence diversity in CDR-H3 from natural origin (Figure 3) [63]. CDR-H1 and -H2 repertoires were designed based on analysis of germlines genes with introduction of hot spot mutations. Those variable parts were constructed with codon-based oligonuceotides to avoid unwanted amino acids and stop codons, with the aim to increase the functional library size. VH3_23 was used as heavy chain acceptor and combined with the full lambda and kappa light chain repertoire. The natural diversity of the CDR-H3 and light chains originated from B-cells of 35 donors having various autoimmune diseases and 10 healthy donors in order to maximize the diversity. The light chain and all three heavy chain CDRs are independently replaceable modules to facilitate affinity maturation. From the phagemid Fab library with a size of 3.5 \u00d7 10 10 and a phage library with a size of 1.0 \u00d7 10 10 , affinities in the subnanomolar range were obtained. Semi-synthetic libraries combine synthetic design and natural sources to different degrees whereas fully synthetic libraries are based on in silico design and de novo synthesis. Three examples are schematically shown. Library A comprises natural diversity within all CDR regions integrated into one selected single scaffold. CDR sequences are gained via PCR amplification from all naturally occurring frameworks (adapted from semi-synthetic N-CoDeR \u00ae library). Library B comprises synthetic diversity in CDR-H1 and -H2 combined by natural diversity within CDR-H3. Whereas one single heavy chain framework was selected, the whole light chain repertoire has been used (adapted from semi-synthetic Dyax library).",

Neugebauer, Kathrin Ladetzki-Baehs, Kathrin Tissot\n## Abstract\nSince the initial description of phage display technology for the generation of human antibodies, a variety of selection methods has been developed. The most critical parameter for all in vitro-based approaches is the quality of the antibody library. Concurrent evolution of the libraries has allowed display and selection technologies to reveal their full potential. They come in different flavors, from na\u00efve to fully synthetic and differ in terms of size, quality, method of preparation, framework and CDR composition. Early on, the focus has mainly been on affinities and thus on library size and diversity. Subsequently, the increased awareness of developability and cost of goods as important success factors has spurred efforts to generate libraries with improved biophysical properties and favorable production characteristics. More recently a major focus on reduction of unwanted side effects through reduced immunogenicity and improved overall biophysical behavior has led to a re-evaluation of library design.\n## Defined Frameworks: Maximal Diversity\nA design strategy of mimicking natural diversity using tailored codons was used to closely mimic the human repertoire. Different library generations were described and it could be shown that the restricted diversity in CDR-H1 and CDR-H2 improved the performance of the library whereas highly variable CDR-H3 sequences were advantageous. Affinities in the low nanomolar range were achieved using these libraries. \n\nHoet and coworkers at Dyax combined synthetic diversity in CDR-H1 and -H2 with length and sequence diversity in CDR-H3 from natural origin (Figure 3) [63]. CDR-H1 and -H2 repertoires were designed based on analysis of germlines genes with introduction of hot spot mutations. Those variable parts were constructed with codon-based oligonuceotides to avoid unwanted amino acids and stop codons, with the aim to increase the functional library size. VH3_23 was used as heavy chain acceptor and combined with the full lambda and kappa light chain repertoire. The natural diversity of the CDR-H3 and light chains originated from B-cells of 35 donors having various autoimmune diseases and 10 healthy donors in order to maximize the diversity. The light chain and all three heavy chain CDRs are independently replaceable modules to facilitate affinity maturation. From the phagemid Fab library with a size of 3.5 \u00d7 10 10 and a phage library with a size of 1.0 \u00d7 10 10 , affinities in the subnanomolar range were obtained. Semi-synthetic libraries combine synthetic design and natural sources to different degrees whereas fully synthetic libraries are based on in silico design and de novo synthesis. Three examples are schematically shown. Library A comprises natural diversity within all CDR regions integrated into one selected single scaffold. CDR sequences are gained via PCR amplification from all naturally occurring frameworks (adapted from semi-synthetic N-CoDeR \u00ae library). Library B comprises synthetic diversity in CDR-H1 and -H2 combined by natural diversity within CDR-H3. Whereas one single heavy chain framework was selected, the whole light chain repertoire has been used (adapted from semi-synthetic Dyax library).\n\n## Conclusions\nOver the past 15 years the generation of therapeutic antibodies from combinatorial antibody libraries has been established as a valid alternative to conventional immunization. To isolate candidates from such libraries the antibodies or antibody fragments are displayed on the surface of cells, phages, ribosomes or within the cell. Among those display methods, phage display has the longest history and it is among the technologies most commonly used today. While the choice of the antibody format can be limited by the display method, e.g., to the scFv or the Fab in the case of phage display, library design is in principle independent, as long as sufficient expression properties in the respective host system are ensured. \n\nCombinatorial antibody libraries differ in design, origin of sequence diversity and method of generation. All three aspects have an impact on the most essential features of a library: its size and functional diversity reflected in the ability to deliver high affinity antibodies with good biophysical properties. Antibody libraries can be classified into three major groups: na\u00efve, semi-synthetic and synthetic libraries. Most libraries aim at maximizing library diversity, but differ in their approaches of maximizing functional size and subsequent developability of the selected molecules. Limitation to a single stable framework or to a selected number of consensus frameworks to ensure good biophysical properties is one trend in this context. Currently there is a trend to be as close to human germline as possible, both in the choice of framework and CDR composition, to avoid potential issues of immunogenicity. \n\nWith the synthetic library of moderate size described by Pini and coworkers, scFvs were selected with monovalent affinities down to 10 nM [57]. Affinities achieved with large semi-synthetic libraries described by Hoet and S\u00f6derlind reached the sub-nanomolar range, whereas antibodies in the lower picomolar range have been isolated directly from the fully synthetic HuCAL PLATINUM \u00ae library as well as the very large na\u00efve CAT2.0 library. Affinity improvement factors vary widely within each method and are highly dependent on both the antigen as well as the starting molecule. The approaches targeting CDR regions have advantages concerning functional size of maturation libraries and integrity of antibody framework.",

            "abstract": "Therapeutic antibody development has become an increasingly popular approach for drug development. To date, antibody therapeutics are largely developed using large scale experimental screens of antibody libraries containing hundreds of millions of antibody sequences. The high cost and difficulty of developing therapeutic antibodies create a pressing need for computational methods to predict antibody properties and create bespoke designs. However, the relationship between antibody sequence and activity is a complex physical process and traditional iterative design approaches rely on large scale assays and random mutagenesis. Deep learning methods have emerged as a promising way to learn antibody property predictors, but predicting antibody properties and target-specific activities depends critically on the choice of antibody representations and data linking sequences to properties is often limited. Existing works have not yet investigated the value, limitations and opportunities of these methods in application to antibody-based drug discovery. In this paper, we present results on a novel SARS-CoV-2 antibody binding dataset and an additional benchmark dataset. We compare three classes of models: conventional statistical sequence models, supervised learning on each dataset independently, and fine-tuning an antibody specific pre-trained language model. Experimental results suggest that self-supervised pretraining of feature representation consistently offers significant improvement in over previous approaches. We also investigate the impact of data size on the model performance, and discuss challenges and opportunities that the machine learning community can address to advance in silico engineering and design of therapeutic antibodies.",

                    "text": "Antibodies are Y-shaped proteins produced by the immune system to tag or neutralize foreign substances, called antigens. As shown in Figure 1, antibodies consist of two identical light chains and two identical heavy chains. Each chain has a variable region and a constant region. The tip of the variable region forms the antibody's binding surface, also known as a paratope. This region recognizes and binds to a specific antigen's binding surface called an epitope. The variable regions of each chain contain three hypervariable regions known as the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), denoted as CDR-L1, CDR-L2, CDR-L3 and CDR-H1, CDR-H2, CDR-H3, for the light and heavy chains respectively (highlighted in yellow in Figure 1). The amino acid sequence of the CDRs determines the antigens to which an antibody will bind (O'Connor, Adams, and Fairman 2010). The variable domain of the light chain can consist of 94-139 amino acids, while that of the heavy chain is slightly longer, consisting of 92-160 amino acids (Abhinandan and Martin 2008). Each amino acid is encoded into a 25-character alphabet with 20 characters for the standard amino acids and 5 characters for non-standard, ambiguous or unknown amino acids. \n\nMany natural properties of antibodies are considered when designing optimized antibody candidates against a specific target including binding affinity, binding specificity, stability, solubility, and effector functions. Antibody binding affinity, the property we focus on in this paper, is the binding strength between the antibody and antigen, and is inversely related to the equilibrium dissociation constant K D , a ratio of K off /K on , where K off measures how quickly an antibody dissociates from the antigen target, and K on measures how quickly the antibody binds to the target (Landry et al. 2015). \n\nStudies on protein crystal structures, including antibodies, have been integral in understanding protein-protein interactions, protein function, and therapeutic development. An understanding of how sequence relates to the structure of the variable domains may illuminate the effects on binding properties of antibody-antigen interactions.",

Spaeth, Leslie Shing, Tristan Bepler, R. Caceres\n## Abstract\nTherapeutic antibody development has become an increasingly popular approach for drug development. To date, antibody therapeutics are largely developed using large scale experimental screens of antibody libraries containing hundreds of millions of antibody sequences. The high cost and difficulty of developing therapeutic antibodies create a pressing need for computational methods to predict antibody properties and create bespoke designs. However, the relationship between antibody sequence and activity is a complex physical process and traditional iterative design approaches rely on large scale assays and random mutagenesis. Deep learning methods have emerged as a promising way to learn antibody property predictors, but predicting antibody properties and target-specific activities depends critically on the choice of antibody representations and data linking sequences to properties is often limited. Existing works have not yet investigated the value, limitations and opportunities of these methods in application to antibody-based drug discovery. In this paper, we present results on a novel SARS-CoV-2 antibody binding dataset and an additional benchmark dataset. We compare three classes of models: conventional statistical sequence models, supervised learning on each dataset independently, and fine-tuning an antibody specific pre-trained language model. Experimental results suggest that self-supervised pretraining of feature representation consistently offers significant improvement in over previous approaches. We also investigate the impact of data size on the model performance, and discuss challenges and opportunities that the machine learning community can address to advance in silico engineering and design of therapeutic antibodies.\n## Background\nAntibodies are Y-shaped proteins produced by the immune system to tag or neutralize foreign substances, called antigens. As shown in Figure 1, antibodies consist of two identical light chains and two identical heavy chains. Each chain has a variable region and a constant region. The tip of the variable region forms the antibody's binding surface, also known as a paratope. This region recognizes and binds to a specific antigen's binding surface called an epitope. The variable regions of each chain contain three hypervariable regions known as the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), denoted as CDR-L1, CDR-L2, CDR-L3 and CDR-H1, CDR-H2, CDR-H3, for the light and heavy chains respectively (highlighted in yellow in Figure 1). The amino acid sequence of the CDRs determines the antigens to which an antibody will bind (O'Connor, Adams, and Fairman 2010). The variable domain of the light chain can consist of 94-139 amino acids, while that of the heavy chain is slightly longer, consisting of 92-160 amino acids (Abhinandan and Martin 2008). Each amino acid is encoded into a 25-character alphabet with 20 characters for the standard amino acids and 5 characters for non-standard, ambiguous or unknown amino acids. \n\nMany natural properties of antibodies are considered when designing optimized antibody candidates against a specific target including binding affinity, binding specificity, stability, solubility, and effector functions. Antibody binding affinity, the property we focus on in this paper, is the binding strength between the antibody and antigen, and is inversely related to the equilibrium dissociation constant K D , a ratio of K off /K on , where K off measures how quickly an antibody dissociates from the antigen target, and K on measures how quickly the antibody binds to the target (Landry et al. 2015). \n\nStudies on protein crystal structures, including antibodies, have been integral in understanding protein-protein interactions, protein function, and therapeutic development. An understanding of how sequence relates to the structure of the variable domains may illuminate the effects on binding properties of antibody-antigen interactions.",

Focusing on the CDR-H3/CDR-L3 interactions, when an Arg is present as third residue of the CDR-L3 loop, as in the germline L3-11, it forms more interactions with the CDR-H3 loop rather than when a Tyr or a Ser is in the same position (Fig. 2a). As previously discussed in literature, Arg located in the CDR loops, is a critical determinant for affinity [79][80][81]. In this case, it seems that this residue may play an important role in the stabilization of the CDR-H3 loop, too. \n\nThe CDR-L1 and the CDR-L2 loops also interact with the CDR-H3 loop, even if their contacts are less occurrent than the ones between CDR-L3 and CDR-H3 loop (SI Fig. 7). In our dataset, CDR-L1 loops show quite some differences in sequence and length, whereas CDR-L2 loops share the same length but differ in sequence. Loop length variation is proven to be a valid strategy for affinity maturation of antibodies, since it influences tertiary structure and activity simultaneously [82,83]. However, an enhancement in affinity does not always go hand in hand with a higher stability. In our dataset, for example, the two germlines with longer CDR-L1 loops, L3-20 and L4-1 (respectively 12 and 17 AA) show only few stabilizing contacts with the CDR-H3 loop. Instead, the L1-39 germline, which is also the most stable one, makes the highest number of interactions (SI Fig. 7a).",

Yet, they typically depend on purified proteins, which exclude from interrogation integral membrane proteins that require the lipid bilayers to support their native form or function. Here, we present a novel Ab discovery strategy, termed CellectSeq, for targeting integral membrane proteins presented on native cells in complex environment. As proof of concept, we targeted the challenging tetraspanin receptor CD151, a target linked to cancer. First, we optimized in situ cell-based selections to enrich Ab pools for antigen-specific binders. Then, we designed novel NGS procedures to explore Ab pools diversities and abundances with enhanced accuracies. Finally, we developed novel motif-based scoring and error filtering algorithms for the comprehensive interrogation of NGS data to identify Abs with high diversities and specificities, even at extremely low abundances. We identified highly selective and diversified Abs against CD151 with abundance as low as 0.00009% for which manual sampling or identification using Abs abundances in NGS data would have been impossible. Here we show that CellectSeq enables the rapid discovery of diversified and selective antibodies against CD151, with implications for other integral membrane proteins and cell-surface receptors.\n## Cell-based in situ selection for anti-CD151 Abs\nTo generate Abs targeting CD151, we used the phage-displayed Library F 37 of synthetic antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) that offers advantageous features for CellectSeq (Figure S1). First, Library F is extremely diverse (> 10 10 unique members) and precisely designed to ensure that most members are stable and well-displayed on phage 38 . Second, the library proves functional for selections with either puri ed antigens 37 or cell-surface antigens 36 and has yielded numerous selective Abs per selections 36 . Third, the library was constructed with a single, highly stable human framework resulting in negligible display bias where most library members are presented at similar levels 37 . Also, the abundances of individual clones in pools enriched for target antigens are highly correlated with relative a nities 39 ; this property enhances NGS analysis based on enrichment ranking, allowing for the identi cation of highly selective and high a nity clones. Fourth, the synthetic Abs are diversi ed at only four complementary determining regions (CDRs; H1, H2 and H3, and L3), which permit standard NGS procedures utilizing primers that anneal to common framework regions in a cost-effective manner (Figure S2 & S3). Fifth, each of the four CDRs is composed of de ned amino acid positions with restricted diversities. Therefore, the NGS data quality can be very accurately evaluated by assessing any deviations from the xed framework or occurrence of unexpected codons at diversi ed positions. For instance, CDRs H1 and H2 contain only six or eight binary degenerate codons and offer a diversity of 64 and 256 unique sequences, respectively (Figure S1D). Conversely, CDRs L3 and H3 are much more diverse in terms of loop lengths (3-7 or 1-17 degenerate codons, respectively), and in terms of sequence composition (encoded by de ned ratios of nine codons encoding nine amino acids).

            "text": "Incidentally, this is also true for the antibody library with a very long CDR (33), which could lead to the accumulation of errors during the synthesis. A proofreading step, such as \uf062-lactamase genetic fu-sion selection, can be added during the construction of the synthetic antibody library in order to increase the proportion of the productive clones (11,13). \n\nWhile CDR-H3 and CDR-L3 are centrally located in the antigen binding site, have a far greater diversity (especially CDR-H3) than other CDRs due to the V(D)J recombination, and play disproportionately large roles in antigen binding (34), there are examples of synthetic antibody libraries with minimal or no diversity in these regions. Minimalist CDR libraries with tetranomial (35) or even binomial (36,37) diversity have been shown to yield specific antibodies against multiple targets, suggesting that a restricted set of amino acids has a sufficient chemical repertoire for the formation of diverse antigen-combining surfaces. Target binders could even be isolated from a library with no CDR-H3 diversity (38). There is also a report indicating that CDR-L3 diversification negatively affects the library fitness (39). Taken together, these examples imply that while the total sequence diversity of the antigen combining site is important for the functionality of the antibody library, different viable methods of diversification and distributing the diversity among the CDRs, may exist.",

            "text": "The importance of characterizing and engineering the structure of antibodies to improve specificity, stability and suitability as biotherapeutics has increased substantially in the past decades. [1][2][3][4] Natural occurring antibodies are symmetric Y-shaped proteins, and each symmetric unit consists of a heavy and light chain. Sequence and structural diversity of antibodies is concentrated on six hypervariable loops, also known as complementaritydetermining regions (CDRs), located within each of the two antibody antigen-binding domains. Three hypervariable loops (CDR-H1, CDR-H2, CDR-H3 and CDR-L1, CDR-L2, CDR-L3) are located on the heavy and light chain, respectively. 5 Various studies have focused on classifying five of the six CDR loops into canonical conformations, except the CDR-H3 loop, assuming that, depending on the length and sequence composition, antibody CDR loops only adopt a limited number of main-chain conformations. 6 The highest variability in length, sequence, and structure can be observed for the CDR-H3 loop. It is known that the CDR-H3 loop samples a large number of conformations during V(D)J recombination and somatic hyper-mutations. 7,8 Together with the CDR-H3 loop, the CDR-L3 loop is situated in the center of the paratope and contributes to antigen recognition. The CDR-L3 loop reveals a comparable diversity to the CDR-H3 loop, but, without the contribution of a D gene, the degree of variability is lower. 9 Besides the CDR-H3 and CDR-L3 loops, the CDR-H1 and CDR-H2 loops also play a vital role in many antibody-antigen interactions and are therefore targeted for mutagenesis in synthetic libraries. With the substantial rise in the number of antibody crystal structures, the number of antibody databases and sequence-based classification servers has also increased significantly. [10][11][12][13] Numerous studies have tried to classify antibody CDR loops structurally and sequentially, and correlate them with their locus and sequence to improve fast antibody structure prediction and design.",

Following the natural antibody tendency favoring the highest variability and paratope involvement in L3 and H3 CDRs, most sAB libraries that have only H3 and L3 diversified and just one of the canonical natural sequences incorporated in place of each of other four CDRs, proved to be very efficient [73,75,76]; however, some high quality libraries have all six CDRs diversified [72,77,78]. Surprisingly, the minimalist libraries, con taining sequences of only two residues, Tyr and Ser, in their CDRs, were proven highly effective in generating specific antibodies against a wide array of antigens pro viding a rationale for high abundance of these two residues in the CDRs of the natural immune reper toire [62,79]. Due to the simpler design, these libraries are relatively easy to construct, and, due to the smaller theoretical size, they possess higher sampling power. Involvement of more of CDRs and CDR positions into deeper diversification, while producing an exponentially increasing number of possible variants, allows to build more enhanced and sterically extended paratopes with higher conformational diversity, thus, facilitating efficient recognition of various epitopes of different types of anti gens. \n\nAs was mentioned above, natural antibody libraries have a huge advantage over any sAB library since they contain only expressible and stable CDR variants that have passed multiple control points of the immune sys tem. In addition, chemical synthesis of CDRs is inher ently compromised by synthetic errors, introducing all sorts of mutations that generate unwanted amino acid substitutions and stop codons resulting in nonfunctional antibody clones [72,77] To eliminate poorly expressed clones and non productive frame shifts, a proofreading step, such as selection of ampicillin resistant sAB -\u03b2 lactamase genetic fusions, has been added as the final step of library construction [77].",

            "text": "The discovery by Polonelli et al. (Polonelli et al. 2003, Magliani et al. 2004a, b) that internal sequences of immunoglobulin variable regions may display antibiotic properties prompted us to investigate the activity of monoclonal antibody (mAb) CDRs tested as synthetic peptides. Immunoglobulins have polymorphic heavy and light chains and the idiotypic variability is related to the diversity of the antigen binding site and particularly to the hypervariable domains called complementaritydetermining regions (CDRs). There are 6 CDRs in both variable regions of light (V L ) and heavy chains (V H ) with background variability on each side of the CDRs. The CDRs are named H1, H2, H3 and L1, L2, L3 in heavy and light chains, respectively. The framework sequences between CDRs can be similar or identical. Although all CDRs are expected to contribute to antigen binding with variable affinity, only the CDR 3 from V H when tested as an isolated linear or cyclic peptide was found to have the same specificity of the original antibody, sharing some of its biological properties. V H CDR3 (H3) peptides with such properties have thus been called micro (mini) antibodies (Levi et al. 1993, Bourgeois et al. 1998). They can even compete with the antibody for binding to a certain antigen. The other CDRs generally do not show a similar reactivity when tested as isolated peptides. \n\nRecently we showed, in collaboration with Polonelli's and Ponton's groups from Parma and Bilbao, respectively, that, independently of the specificity of the native Ab, CDRs other than H3 may display, with high frequency, antimicrobial, antiviral and antitumor activities in a way reminiscent of molecules of early innate immunity (Litman et al. 2005).",

            "text": "The fundamental difference between immune or na\u00efve libraries and synthetic libraries consists in the origin of the sequences used to build the library. While immune and na\u00efve libraries are amplified from a natural source, synthetic library parts are diversified by design. In synthetic libraries the antibody diversity is designed in silico and then synthesized in a controlled fashion. \n\nThe ratio of naturally-derived and synthetically-designed parts varies in different libraries from semi-to fully synthetic. An advantage of synthetic diversification is that the composition of the CDRs can be exactly defined and controlled. \n\nSynthetic libraries can further be grouped according to the acceptor frameworks used, the origin or design of the sequence diversity within the CDR regions and the method used for building the library. \n\nThe first semi-synthetic libraries used a variety of different framework genes to keep diversity high [55,56,62,79]. In 1992 Hoogenboom and Winter described semi-synthetic scFv-antibody phage display libraries, comprising 49 germline VH sequences and a single V_lambda 3 light chain sequence [79]. Five or eight residues in the CDR-H3 were randomized in a PCR-based approach to generate libraries with a size of 1 \u00d7 10 7 . Subsequent libraries were based on the same set of acceptor VH frameworks, with the addition of 26 kappa and 21 lambda sequences [62]. Length variability was introduced in the CDR3s and diversity generated through randomization of 4-12 residues in CDR-H3, 1-3 residues in kappa CDR-L3 and 0-5 residues in lambda CDR-L3. In parallel, library size increased over three orders of magnitude up to 6.5 \u00d7 10 10 . \n\nIn a similar approach, de Kruif and collaborators used all 49 human germline VH genes and seven different light chain genes (4 V_kappa, 3 V_lambda) with CDR-H3 length variability between 6-15 residues to construct a library of the size of 3.6 \u00d7 10 8 . \n\nThe shorter CDR-H3s of six amino acid length were fully randomized, whereas for the longer CDR-H3s the design included a stretch of fully randomized amino acid residues flanked by regions of lower diversity resembling human antibody sequences [56].",

            "text": "As a result, this library has more nature-like sequences, which conceivably have better functionality, stability and folding behavior than libraries with a lot of unnatural sequences (32). In another example utilizing the technology for antibody library construction, CDR3 of the heavy and the light chains were synthesized to reflect the length variation and the amino acid usage of the corresponding regions of naturally occurring human antibodies, where the usage of certain PTM-prone amino acids such as Asn, Asp, and Met was decreased or lacking (15). \n\nThe synthetic antibody libraries differ not only in CDR sequence diversification strategy, but also the CDRs that were diversified. Many high-quality libraries have all six CDRs diversified (11,13,14,26,31), achieving maximal conformational diversity needed for the efficient isolation of antibodies against various epitopes of different types of antigens. On the other hand, there are many synthetic antibody libraries with only a smaller number of CDRs diversified, in most cases CDR-H3 and CDR-L3 (8,10,12). These libraries have a simpler design and are relatively easy to construct, the natural germline sequences of the invariable CDRs are likely to contribute to the better folding and stability at the expense of lower conformational and sequence diversity, and they have been successfully utilized in the generation of high-affinity, target-specific antibody molecules. One thing to consider regarding the number of the diversified CDRs is the functionality of the library. The synthesis of oligonucleotides for the diversified CDRs is inherently vulnerable to synthetic errors, often introducing mutations, insertions, and deletions of nucleotides that can result in nonfunctional antibody clones. The proportion of nonfunctional clones increases geometrically with the increasing number of the diversified CDRs; therefore, with six diversified CDRs a significant proportion of the clones in the library can be unproductive (11,13). Incidentally, this is also true for the antibody library with a very long CDR (33), which could lead to the accumulation of errors during the synthesis.",

            "text": "BackgroundAntibody phage display is a proven key technology that allows the generation of human antibodies for diagnostics and therapy. From naive antibody gene libraries - in theory - antibodies against any target can be selected. Here we describe the design, construction and characterization of an optimized antibody phage display library.ResultsThe naive antibody gene libraries HAL9 and HAL10, with a combined theoretical diversity of 1.5\u00d71010 independent clones, were constructed from 98 healthy donors using improved phage display vectors. In detail, most common phagemids employed for antibody phage display are using a combined His/Myc tag for detection and purification. We show that changing the tag order to Myc/His improved the production of soluble antibodies, but did not affect antibody phage display. For several published antibody libraries, the selected number of kappa scFvs were lower compared to lambda scFvs, probably due to a lower kappa scFv or Fab expression rate. Deletion of a phenylalanine at the end of the CL linker sequence in our new phagemid design increased scFv production rate and frequency of selected kappa antibodies significantly. The HAL libraries and 834 antibodies selected against 121 targets were analyzed regarding the used germline V-genes, used V-gene combinations and CDR-H3/-L3 length and composition. The amino acid diversity and distribution in the CDR-H3 of the initial library was retrieved in the CDR-H3 of selected antibodies showing that all CDR-H3 amino acids occurring in the human antibody repertoire can be functionally used and is not biased by E. coli expression or phage selection. Further, the data underline the importance of CDR length variations.ConclusionThe highly diverse universal antibody gene libraries HAL9/10 were constructed using an optimized scFv phagemid vector design. Analysis of selected antibodies revealed that the complete amino acid diversity in the CDR-H3 was also found in selected scFvs showing the functionality of the naive CDR-H3 diversity.",

            "text": "Stem loop biases in both the CDRs H3 and L3 were also closely maintained and limited diversity was introduced at several key positions in the structurally conserved V\u03ba and V\u03bb L3 loops. This repertoire design was highly effective in generating nM-affinity clones with specificity for a selection of proteins and peptides (Knappik et al., 2000;Marget et al., 2000). \n\nThe methods used by Knappik et al. (2000) have since been elaborated upon in a number of reports. Rothe et al. (2008), reported the construction of the next-generation library HuCal Gold\u2122 in which the design strategy was refined to change the CDR design complexity, the structural format of the library (to Fab fragment) and also to move to \"CysDisplay\" in which the expressed antibody is tethered to the phage via a disulphide bond with a mutant p3 protein. In this library, the CDR diversity was extended to the CDRs 1 and 2 of both V-domains, in addition to the CDR3s. The CDR cassettes were again based on trinucleotide technology and were built to accurately reflect the canonical structures and diversity found in the families upon which each of the consensus frameworks were built, consciously including structures known to be preferred in the recognition of peptides. The finalized library was found to be of very high practical utility, routinely generating antibody specificities and affinities in the single digit nM range that were useful for both therapeutic and reagent purposes (Jarutat et al., 2006(Jarutat et al., , 2007;;Ohara et al., 2006;Prassler et al., 2009). This library design had, however, made a critical concession to optimize its function in E. coli expression and phage display technology: the FRs were codon optimized specifically to maximize for E. coli periplasmic expression rate. In addition, this function had been aggressively selected for by pre-screening all antibody sequences for periplasmic transport as \u03b2-lactamase fusions before inclusion in the final library.",

            "text": "However, a glycine residue in the CDR-H3 was determined to be critical for the paratope conformation enabling high affinity binding. A high throughput workflow process was established and pressure-tested using a panel of proteins to demonstrate that reduction in the complexity in the design of the library circumvented some of the common challenges encountered with natural antibodies that can stall high throughput processes, such as expression, purification, and sequence analysis, and could have potential utility for proteomic studies and identify features in CDR sequences that regulate antibody:antigen interactions. In fact, this approach has also been applied to the 10 FN3 alternative scaffold [54]. \n\nWhile Tyr/Ser binary libraries will produce high affinity antibodies for some antigens, this is not true for all protein classes, implying that greater diversity would be required for a broader range of antigens and wider applications, and may even need to be tailored to specific protein target classes with more complex structures. Thus, the minimalist synthetic CDR-H3 library strategy was explored further to generate antibodies with therapeutic potential [55]. Trinucleotide synthesis technology [56] was employed to introduce approx. equal quantities of all amino acids at each engineered position (other than cysteine) in order to evaluate the contribution of amino acid classes to antibody function. Therefore, libraries were constructed on a single framework scaffold, the clinically validated DP47 heavy chain and DP-K22 light chain, with either randomization of the CDR-H3 alone or the CDR-H3 and CDR-L3 and included incorporation of a range of loop lengths (in equal proportions rather than the parabolic distribution seen with the natural human antibody repertoire). These libraries were evaluated on a number of different types of antigen to determine the influence of the amino acid composition and CDR length on the output from the selections. It was observed that loop length and CDR-H3 stem composition (potentially stabilizing the loop) played a key role in the functional output, whereas diversification of CDR-L3 was not essential for library performance.",

            "text": "In this paper, we have shown that kappa and lambda CDR-L3 regions differ significantly in their physicochemical properties, indicating that kappa and lambda light chains may have differing roles in antibody binding. \n\nIn accordance with previous publications, we found that lambda CDR-L3 regions are, on average, significantly longer and more hydrophobic than kappa (20), and, in addition, we found that lambda CDR-L3 regions have a higher aliphatic index than kappa CDR-L3 regions. In the case of heavy chains, long hydrophobic CDR-H3 regions are selected against as B cells mature and pass through tolerance checkpoints (42)(43)(44) (and data not shown), and it is thought that these properties in heavy chains are associated with autoreactivity (45). However, despite their longer, hydrophobic qualities, lambda light chains have been reported to be better at removing a polyspecific antibody phenotype than kappa in vitro (17). Since, in vivo, the lambda locus is rearranged after the kappa locus (13), lambda light chains are perhaps likely to have a role in \"rescuing\" antibodies that were autoreactive when the same heavy chain was paired with a kappa light chain. The apparent contradiction between proposed roles of longer hydrophobic CDR3 regions in heavy vs. light chains may indicate that CDR-L3 and CDR-H3 regions have different roles to play in the structure of the antigen-binding site. \n\nBoth kappa and lambda isotypes had a very high frequency of CDR-L3 regions with pI of between 6.08 and 6.10. A similar pattern is also seen in the heavy chain repertoire in our data (not shown) and Figure 4A. This suggests that a slightly acidic CDR-L3 pI (net negative charge at neutral pH) is highly advantageous in the antibody repertoire and that a CDR-L3 pI of approximately 7.00 (net neutral charge at neutral pH) is less so, as very few sequences of either isotype have a neutral CDR-L3 pI. It has been suggested that a more basic CDR-H3 pI may be associated with polyspecificity (46).",

            "text": "It was observed that loop length and CDR-H3 stem composition (potentially stabilizing the loop) played a key role in the functional output, whereas diversification of CDR-L3 was not essential for library performance. This was further borne out by demonstrating proof of principle using delta-like ligand 4 (DLL4) as antigen and isolating high affinity binders with neutralization of the DLL4-NOTCH1 interaction yielding IC 50 values below 10 nM (and equivalent to a benchmark antibody directed to DLL4). Broadening the diversity by the inclusion of nonparatope residues not only enhances affinity but is necessary for target specificity, as well as CDR-H3 loop length [52] and the CDR-L3 loop length influences VH antigen interactions [55]. \n\nThus, semisynthetic and synthetic libraries incorporate design features such as a germline framework known to have favorable developability features. The most important aspect of diversity in any phage antibody library is that of the complementarity determining regions or CDRs, which confer antigen recognition and specificity. Many more examples of strategies applied to generate a robust phage display library for antibody discovery have been comprehensively reviewed in several recent publications [25,31] as well as the key attributes of historically important antibody libraries constructed for the identification of therapeutic antibodies [31]. \n\nDirect synthesis has enabled a much higher degree of precision and efficiency. Through solid-phase synthesis along with miniaturized chemistry, it is possible to synthesize oligonucleotides without randomization. Specifically, DNA synthesis can now be reliably performed on a large scale [57,58], such that millions of custom oligonucleotides can be synthesized as oligo pools on chip surfaces making the generation of large libraries of deliberately designed antibodies [59] that can be rapidly produced and screened in parallel. Significantly, such libraries need not be full-length antibodies as synthesis only needs to be restricted to antibody regions that contain CDR loops, such as VHH, scFv, and Fab antibody fragments. This approach opens the door to high-throughput screening opportunities. As with other synthesis methods, direct synthesis is not without its hurdles. Highly parallel direct oligonucleotide synthesis requires substantial infrastructure and automation.",

            "text": "The use of VH sequences devoid of PTMs in their CDR-H1 and CDR-H2 make the subsequent removal of such motifs unnecessary; however, they harbor the risk of being potentially immunogenic in humans. To keep the risk for immunogenicity (i.e., the generation of T cell epitopes) at a minimum, the required amino acid exchanges were performed in a controlled way. All Ig sequences were also adapted for optimal codon usage in E. coli and in mammalian cells providing adequate conditions for convenient production of Fab as well as human IgG1. 27 he major challenge in cloning large antibody libraries is producing a large number of functional members. In Ylanthia, CDR-H1 and -H2 are diversified, but only CDR-L3 and CDR-H3s were randomized, as these regions have the strongest influence on antigen-binding and affinity. To ensure high quality and sequence correctness the CDR-L3 cassettes were synthesized using preassembled trinucleotides (TRIMs) 28 and the CDR-H3 cassettes were synthesized through the Slonomics technology. 29 hile in nature, CDR-H3 length varies from a few amino acids to more than 30 residues, 53 only CDR-H3 lengths of 6 to 17 amino acids were implemented in Ylanthia, as these lengths represent the majority of naturally occurring CDR-H3 sequences. In addition, potential critical PTM sites have been omitted or reduced in the CDR3s to prevent later antibody comparison to the initial design. The degree of redundant CDR-H3 sequences, as revealed by 454 sequencing, is in line with the CDR-H3 redundancy observed after next generation sequencing of other antibody libraries with fully synthetic CDR3s. For example, a scFv library generated by Nicolas Fischer and his colleagues exhibited 98.5% unique sequences 67 and the HuCAL Platinum library 20 where 454 sequence analysis of several Ig heavy chain sub-libraries was performed resulted in 98% unique CDR-H3 sequences (Josef Prassler, personal communication).",

This detailed examination of purified VH/VL pairs included the quantification of research-scale Fab and full-length human  Natural CDR-H3 diversity is mainly generated by VDJ recombination of different VH, D and JH gene segments that result in CDR-H3 sequence length variations from a few to more than 30 amino acids. 53 In Ylanthia, 12 different CDR-H3 lengths ranging from 6 to 17 amino acids were implemented. These CDR-H3 lengths cover about 80% of naturally occurring CDR-H3 sequences as described by Zemlin and coworkers. The CDR-H3 length and amino acid composition design was identical for all VH gene segments used. It has been observed that JH4 is used predominantly in rearranged human antibodies and that the incorporation of the longest JH6 gene segment gains importance with increasing CDR-H3 lengths, resulting in subtle differences in positional amino acids diversities. Therefore, the realized amino acid composition in the CDR-H3 is based on naturally rearranged Ig sequences using JH4, where the composition of the lengths 12 to 17 amino acids has an additional JH6-based design closely reflecting the CDR-H3 length-dependent amino acid frequencies in the human antibody repertoire. \n\nTo abolish or reduce the occurrence of potential critical PTM sites in the CDR-L3 and CDR-H3, the amino acids asparagine (Asn, N), aspartic acid (Asp, D) and methionine (Met, M) were decreased or completely omitted, as, for example, in the case of Asn in CDR-H3 sequences. The overall CDR-H3 design is schematically illustrated in Figure 9. \n\nMolecular size measurements of purified IgG1 VH/VL pairs.

In vivo approach relies on the immunization of wild type or transgenic animals carrying human antibody gene segments, while in vitro approach employs the selection power by display technologies to pan large and diverse antibody libraries [3]. Both approaches have been proved very successful and have generated best-selling antibody therapeutics such as Keytruda and Humira, respectively [4,5]. Recent advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning also facilitated in silico rational antibody design [1]. \n\nIn vitro selection of synthetic antibody libraries complements in vivo immunization-based approaches by providing unique, non-natural antibody paratopes and escaping the limitations of self-tolerance [6,7]. One of challenges in the rational design of man-made antibody diversity lies in the complementarity determining region (CDR) H3 loop (CDR-H3) of antibody heavy chain variable region. Traditionally, CDR-H3 loop was randomly diversified by degenerate codons or parsimonious degenerate codons 102 Antibody Therapeutics, 2021 [8], which limited the therapeutic potential of antibody hits. Although TRInucleotide technology and Slonomics technology helped to reduce dysfunctional motifs and to precisely control the codon biases, the CDR-H3 still could not fully mimic that of natural diversity generated by V(D)J recombination and somatic hypermutation process [9,10]. This limits the translational success of therapeutic antibody candidates derived from in vitro selection of phage or yeast libraries [11]. Recently, massive datasets of human immune repertoires by Briney, Soto and others made it possible for us to survey billions of antibody heavy chain sequences for a better understanding of CDR-H3 natural diversity at immune repertoire level [12][13][14]. \n\nIn this study, we aim to understand natural immune diversity of the CDR-H3 loop in a precisely controlled manner. From antibody engineers' perspective, we observed CDR-H3 length-dependent usage of human IGHJ4 and IGHJ6 gene segments in the natural human immune repertoire.",

            "text": "The antigen-binding sites of human antibodies commonly adopt similar structures, with the light and heavy chains each providing three hypervariable loops that combine to form a surface that is complementary to the epitope. While the sequences of these complementarity determining regions (CDRs) are highly variable, five of the six CDRs (L1, L2, L3, H1 and H2) can be classified into a number of relatively small sets, with similar lengths and architectures, and their structures are predictable from sequence (Chothia et al., 1989;North et al., 2011). In contrast, the third CDR loop of the heavy chain (CDR H3) is more structurally diverse, most likely due to its location close to the V(D)J recombination site (Weitzner et al., 2015). Human antibodies typically have CDR H3 lengths of 8-16 residues (Zemlin et al., 2008) while mouse antibodies have CDR H3 lengths of 5-26 residues (Zemlin et al., 2003). \n\nHowever, recent years have seen the discovery of antibodies with major differences from the norm, in particular due to changes in the length of the third CDR of the heavy chain. A set of antibodies with broadly neutralizing potential against HIV is one such example. Here, the third CDR loop of the heavy chain is elongated, allowing it to reach through the glycan shield that surrounds the gp120 protein to bind an otherwise concealed epitope (McLellan et al., 2011;Pancera et al., 2013;Pejchal et al., 2010). Such antibodies are rare, making the induction of a broadly inhibitory response against HIV a major challenge (Corti and Lanzavecchia, 2013). \n\nIn a more extreme example, while the majority of bovine antibodies have CDR H3 loops of around 23 residues, around 10% contain a highly elongated third CDR loop of up to 69 residues, containing a small disulphide rich domain (Saini et al., 1999;Wang et al., 2013).",

            "text": "CDR sequences in the variable regions of immunoglobulins are thought to act cooperatively in the recognition of an antigen. Among them, CDR H3 is at the center of antigen recognition, but the other five CDRs are more or less involved for increased binding affinity to the antigen and some contact residues can even be located within framework regions [17]. The observation that Ab specificity is determined by a limited number of residues has allowed the synthesis of small peptides based on CDRs which retain binding properties and functions of the intact Ab [18,19]. Diversity of CDR1 and CDR2 is encoded by the germline and further modified by somatic mutation; that of CDR L3 and CDR H3 arises somatically by rearrangement of the V segment with the JL or DH and JH segments, respectively. \n\nIsolated CDR sequences, frequently CDR H3, showed the same specificity of the native Ab and were called micro(mini)antibodies [20,21]. Diversity of CDR H3 is sufficient to allow otherwise identical IgM molecules to distinguish between a variety of haptens and protein antigens [22]. It has even been postulated that diverse CDR3 loops represent a highly antigen specific recognition core whereas other CDRs bind opportunistically [23]. Recently, a tyrosine-sulfated peptide derived from CDR H3 of an HIV-1neutralizing Ab was shown to bind gp120 and inhibit HIV-1 infection [24]. Apart from the microantibodies that may display anti-viral [25] and antitumor [26] activities as does the native Ab, less is known about the biological activities of other CDR and framework sequences tested as isolated peptides. Some CDR and framework region-derived peptides, however, have been described as inhibitors of receptor-ligand interactions, cell adhesion and of microbial or viral infections [5,27]. Several peptides including amino acids from the CDRs of anti-CD4 mAb ST40 and framework residues flanking the CDRs bound to soluble CD4 and displaced Ab binding [28]. Bioactive paratope-derived peptides of potential pharmacological interest were also deduced by hydropathic complementarity [29].",

            "text": "Our results show that the individual CDR loops and the whole paratope, including the relative V H -V L interdomain orientations, follow the concept of conformational diversity. Figure S1 illustrates the free energy surfaces of the CDR-L1, CDR-L2, and CDR-L3 loops, to investigate if the mutation at position 71 H also influences the conformational diversity of the light chain CDR loops. In all light chain CDR loops, the free energy surfaces for the mutant reveal a broader conformational space similar to the increase in flexibility which was observed for the CDR-H3 loop. A potential explanation for this higher flexibility when substituting an alanine to an arginine could be that the introduction of arginine residues can enhance the promiscuity of antibodies (42,83).",

The sequences of CDR-H3 (Kabat numbering) were compared in the six CDR regions (CDR-L1, L2, L3, H1, H2, and H3) of the antibody [30][31][32]. The CDR-H3 region of an antibody has the most sequence and structural diversity and is known to play the most important role in antigen-binding specificity among the six CDRs [33][34][35][36]. Moreover, the synthetic human scFv library used in this study also has the most diverse sequence and structural features of CDR-H3 [29]. \n\nThe nucleotide and amino acid sequence of phagemid vector for scFvs (VH-linker-VL) were analyzed using 19 clones of different sequences isolated by conventional bio-panning and 6 clones (included in 19 sequences) selected by semi-automated cell panning (cell panning) established in this study. The CDR-H3 sequences of 19 different clones selected by bio-panning were confirmed to have various lengths and amino acid configurations. Six clones (A1D06, S2D05, S3A06, S3B09, S1E12, and A1A10) selected by cell panning were marked with gray highlights (Figure 3B). The CDR-H3 sequences of the six clones were compared for similarity through phylogenetic tree analysis using a Clustal W (multiple sequence alignment programs) tool. Clones A1D06, S2D05, S3A06, and S3B09 (Clade A) were significantly similar in sequence and length to CDR-H3, but S1E12 and A1A10 showed differences (Figure 3B). To compare the CDR-H3 structural similarity between the selected six clones, Fv modeling was first performed using the SAbPred (a structure-based antibody prediction server) tool (Figure S3) [37].",

            "text": "This suggests that while changes in CDR-H3 conformation on binding are still uncommon, they are much more common than for the non-CDR-H3 loops. The fact that \u223c8% and \u223c13% more of the CDR-H3 loops have local C\u03b1 RMSD of \u2264 2.0\u00c5 and \u2264 1.0\u00c5, respectively, suggests both that loop flapping is much more common in CDR-H3 than it is in the other CDRs and that the degree of flapping is greater than with the other CDRs. \n\nCDR conformational change from global fitting was also plotted against loop length (Figure 5). A single loop length group dominates CDR-H1, CDR-H2, CDR-L2, and CDR-L3. In our dataset, CDR-L1 has two major groups: 11 and 16 residues. In contrast, CDR-H3 has diverse loop lengths, with the majority being between 7 and 16 residues. For CDR-H3 loops, little correlation between conformational change and loop length was observed (Spearman rank correlation coefficient between global C\u03b1 RMSD and loop length is 0.13; p-value of 0.08). However, we do observe a larger conformational change when the loop becomes longer for ten antibodies with CDR-H3 loop length \u226517 residues: the CDR-H3 global C\u03b1 RMSD from such antibodies ranges between 0.93\u00c5 and 6.65\u00c5, see Figure 5(H3). Although it appears that the longer loops might commonly undergo a larger conformational change upon binding, this may be a result of the limited number of antibodies with such long CDR-H3 loops (only 10 antibodies in AbAgDb have a CDR-H3 loop longer than 16 residues which only accounts for 7% of entries).",

            "text": "Although successful, these libraries included antibody genes toxic to Escherichia coli, and thus yielded low expression levels or no expression at all, which severely compromised the number of functional antibodies displayed in the library. Synthetic antibody libraries were developed to partially mitigate this limitation. 11 In this alternative approach, the libraries were carefully designed by making assumptions on the number of scaffolds, positions to diversify, type of amino acids to include in the design and proportion of each amino acid per position to diversify. These assumptions did not always hold true, particularly at complementarity-determining region (CDR)-H3, which is a key element in defining the specificity and affinity of antibodies and by far the most diverse region of the antigen-binding site. Thus, while the structure of CDRs other than the CDR-H3 can be predicted with an accuracy of <1.0 \u00c5, 15 no method is currently available to reliably predict the CDR-H3 structure, limiting our ability to properly design the diversity at this region of the antigen-binding site Obviously, the quality of the synthetic fragments comprising the library also affects its functionality. Nucleotide sequences with stop codons leading to truncated sequences do not produce functional antibody fragments fused to a virion particle. Insertions or deletions of one or two nucleotides change the reading frame of the gene sequence, generating stretches of amino acids that may impair folding or clones with hydrophobic amino acids that result in aggregation. These non-functional antibody variants lead to poorly performing antibody phage display libraries. \n\nFurther, antibodies selected from na\u00efve and synthetic libraries, despite having the desired specificity and affinity, have often failed during the late development stages of formulation and manufacturing due to suboptimal developability profiles. 16 For instance, some amino acids undergo posttranslational modifications such as deamidation of asparagine (N), oxidation of methionine (M), and isomerization of aspartic acid (D). 17 Chemical modifications of these amino acids can result in heterogeneities in the antibody preparation or lack of potency if said amino acids are involved in the interaction with the antigen.",

            "text": "Antibodies (Abs) are formed by heavy and light chains composed of constant and variable regions. The latter include six complementarity determining regions (CDRs) which constitute the antigen (Ag) binding-site. The structural repertoires and the relationships between amino acid sequences and tertiary structures have been extensively studied to reveal the importance of the typical loops, which are canonical structures in the three CDR segments belonging to the light chain (Ll, L2, and L3) as well as the first two CDR segments of the heavy chain (Hl and H2) [1]. The third CDR of the heavy chain (H3) displays wide variety in its length and amino acid sequence, and no canonical structures have ever been established for it [1,2,3]. Variety of CDR1 and CDR2 is encoded by the germline and furtherly diversified by somatic mutation while the one of CDR L3 and CDR H3 is somatically generated by rearrangement of the variable (V) segment with the joining (J) L or diversity (D) H and JH segments, respectively. Notably, CDR H3 plays a crucial role in mediating individual Ag recognition, sometimes by changing its conformation upon Ag binding [4], although the other five CDRs are also more or less implicated in increasing binding affinity to Ag and some contact residues can even be situated within framework of variable regions [5]. \n\nThe observation that Ab specificity is determined by a limited number of residues has prompted the synthesis of small peptides based on CDR sequences which retain binding properties and functions of the intact Ab [6,7]. \n\nIn previous studies it has been demonstrated that the CDRs, or related peptidic fragments, of a recombinant single chain Ab (scFv), representing the internal image of a wide antimicrobial spectrum Pichia anomala killer toxin (KT), may exert a specific microbicidal activity in vitro against KT-sensitive microorganisms characterized by specific cell-wall receptors mainly constituted by 1,3-b-glucans [8].",

            "text": "Antibody affinity maturation by phage display is a highly efficient way of developing therapeutic antibodies (Lowe et al., 2012). Gerstner et al. chose 19 surface-exposed residues, including 12 residues of CDR-H and 7 residues of CDR-L, known to be located in the areas directly contacting HER2, and constructed randomized Fab libraries targeting these residues. They chose and combined 5-7 residues, including 2-4 residues from CDR-H and 1-3 residues from CDR-L per library and randomized all these residues at the same time (Gerstner et al., 2002). \n\nIn contrast to previous studies, we choose 6 residues at positions #98, 100, 100b, 100c, 101 and 102 of CDR-H3 and randomized those 6 residues simultaneously. In addition, because it has been reported that binding affinity can be increased by a combination of mutations isolated from separate libraries (Schier et al., 1996), we randomized the residues within either CDR-H3 or CDR-L3, panned each library, and selected the variants based on their anti-cancer activities. Then, the selected variants were cloned into the expression vectors pOptiVEC (for heavy chain expression) or pcDNA3.3 (for light chain expression). An additional diverse antibody repertoire was achieved by a combination of heavy and light chains, and the resulting IgG antibodies with substituted residues in both the heavy and light chains were expressed in CHO-S cells and finally evaluated on their anti-cancer activity (step-by-step screening scheme, Fig. 2). \n\nWe used a step-by-step rather than one-step strategy to efficiently randomize both CDR-H and CDR-L without difficulty in determining the position and the number of residues for randomization. Such a substitution of both CDR-H and CDR-L was expected to further improve the binding affinity as well as the functional activity of the antibody.",

When analyzing the mean proportions of light chain CDR regions adopting specific secondary structures, we found significant differences between kappa and lambda (Figure 5A). In particular, we found that the likelihood of beta structure content was significantly higher in kappa CDR-L1 and -L2 regions but significantly lower in CDR-L3 regions when compared to lambda light chains. Moreover, we found that differences in the frequency of beta propensity in CDR-L1 and -L2 tended to be compensated for by higher frequencies of helix and coil propensities, respectively, in the lambda isotype. In the CDR-L3 region, there were significant differences between kappa and lambda propensities for beta, coil, and turn structures. \n\nTo date, much attention has been paid to the role of the heavy chain CDR-H3 region in antibody binding, and the contribution of the light chain to antibody-binding specificity has sometimes been overlooked. Our findings show that there are significant differences in kappa and lambda light chains and lend further support to a growing body of evidence that they may have different roles in the adaptive immune response.",

            "text": "Characterizing and understanding the antibody binding interface have become a pre-requisite for rational antibody design and engineering. The antigen-binding site is formed by six hypervariable loops, known as the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) and by the relative interdomain orientation (VH\u2013VL). Antibody CDR loops with a certain sequence have been thought to be limited to a single static canonical conformation determining their binding properties. However, it has been shown that antibodies exist as ensembles of multiple paratope states, which are defined by a characteristic combination of CDR loop conformations and interdomain orientations. In this study, we thermodynamically and kinetically characterize the prominent role of residue 71H (Chothia nomenclature), which does not only codetermine the canonical conformation of the CDR-H2 loop but also results in changes in conformational diversity and population shifts of the CDR-H1 and CDR-H3 loop. As all CDR loop movements are correlated, conformational rearrangements of the heavy chain CDR loops also induce conformational changes in the CDR-L1, CDR-L2, and CDR-L3 loop. These overall conformational changes of the CDR loops also influence the interface angle distributions, consequentially leading to different paratope states in solution. Thus, the type of residue of 71H, either an alanine or an arginine, not only influences the CDR-H2 loop ensembles, but co-determines the paratope states in solution. Characterization of the functional consequences of mutations of residue 71H on the paratope states and interface orientations has broad implications in the field of antibody engineering.",

Longer CDR-H3s (> 17 residues) do not seem compatible with this class of antibodies (Figure S2 D). \n\nBased on these prominent antibody structure classes, three sets of synthetic antibody libraries with increasing structural complexity were designed and constructed: set(1) GH2-13 (one antibody library): 13-10-11-8-9 antibodies with 13residue CDR-H3s (CDR sequence designs shown in Tables S1 and S2); set(2) GH2-6 ~20 (11 antibody libraries): 13-10-11-8-9 antibodies with 6 ~20-residue CDR-H3s, excluding 13-residue CDR-H3s (CDR sequence designs shown in Tables S1 and S3); set(3) GH3-6 ~13 (8 libraries): 13-10-16-8-9 and 13-10-17-8-9 antibodies with 6 ~13-residue CDR-H3s (CDR sequence designs shown in Tables S4 and S5).

Regarding monomer content, the behavior of the 36 VH/VL framework pairs (not more than 2% aggregates) is largely preserved in the VH/V\u03ba IgG1 output from phage pannings. As already discussed above for VH/V\u03bb pairs containing V\u03bb3-1, they seem to be more prone to aggregation. An explanation for this increased aggregation tendency may be found in the relatively flexible V\u03bb CDR-L3 compared with more rigid V\u03ba CDR-L3 sequence compositions. 44,63,69 evertheless, the majority of the antigen-selected antibody molecules closely preserved the biophysical features that were characteristic of the corresponding \"parental\" VH/VL framework pair. Slight biophysical deviations were observed only in a minority of selected binders and thus have to be attributed to the influence of the particular CDR-L3 and CDR-H3 sequences. While such effects remain difficult to circumvent without abating overall CDR3 diversity, a very good balance between biophysically optimal and diverse VH/VL pairs has been obtained after phage selections. \n\nThe Ylanthia library is thus based on a novel concept that incorporates desirable antibody characteristics in its design through selection of optimal framework pairs and careful design of the CDRs. It represents a new platform that generates fully human antibody candidates with optimized biophysical properties to ensure straight-forward and fast antibody processing and development. In many cases Ylanthia antibodies may not require further engineering and thus may save valuable time in the discovery process.",

These early synthetic libraries focused on using selected frameworks restricting diversity to the CDRs [49,50], but were unable to robustly generate high affinity antibodies against a broad range of protein targets. Thus, as well as efforts to expand the diversity further in all the CDR loops, the range of well-behaved frameworks was increased to generate content that better reflected the natural repertoire observed in humans [24,51]. Modular design features enabling facile engineering, such as for affinity maturation, were incorporated [46] along with a focus on antibody sequences (and therefore structure) that impacted on performance and function. \n\nOne avenue of refining synthetic library design has been to take a minimalist strategy and decrease randomization by using a single framework with a binary code to diversify the CDR-H3. In one such study, Tyr and Ser were selected as these have been found to be highly abundant in antibody binding sites [52]. The initial library randomized only the VH CDR positions by binary code [53] and then diversity expanded incrementally to the VL CDR positions, as well as nonparatope residues that may impact on CDR conformation and structure. Improvements in affinity (to single digit nanomolar) were observed for the model soluble antigen used (VEGF) where the tyrosine side chains were sufficient to mediate the majority of antigen interactions. However, a glycine residue in the CDR-H3 was determined to be critical for the paratope conformation enabling high affinity binding.",

The Fc is formed by the non-covalent association of CH2 and CH3 domains, with critical residues in the hinge and CH2 determining the immune effector functions of the IgG antibody via interaction with the Fc gamma family of receptors (Fc\u03b3Rs) and the complement component C1q. Engagement of Fc\u03b3Rs on immune effector cells activates cellular responses such as ADCC and antibody-dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis (ADCP). Complement fixation, starting with the interaction of the antibody and the complement component C1q, induces activation and formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC), finally resulting in complement-mediated cytotoxicity (CDC). \n\nThe human IgG has four subclasses: IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4, also known as isotypes (28).

            "text": "CDR lengths determination of each individual library has revealed clear conservation in CDRs H1, H2, and L2 (Table 3). In addition, there was moderate diversity in the lengths of CDR L1, and high variability in CDRs H3 and L3. The length of CDRs H1, H2, and L2 were identical for all the post-selection clones isolated from the three libraries, irrespective of binding specificity. In contrast, CDR H3 and L3 (post-selection) lengths could be clustered into two groups: (i) antibodies that were developed against COP (library two) having generally shorter CDR H3 and L3 when compared to (ii) the antibodies developed against SQA, POR, and HSL (from libraries one and three, respectively). In general terms, the selection process has introduced bias into the CDR lengths recovered with CDRs H3, L1, and L3 having lengths in post-selection clones that were represented at low frequency in the pre-selection repertoires. Canonical classification was performed utilizing a strict Chothia SDR template, on all the CDRs except CDR H3. The pre-selection sequences from all three libraries comprised heavy chain sequences dominated by a 1-1 canonical combination for CDR's H1 and H2 (Table 4). Typically, these classes corresponded to CDR lengths of 10 (CDR H1) and 9 (CDR H2) amino acids. There was moderate but not unexpected variability in the classification of lambda light chains within preselection sequences. A significant contribution to the overall library variability was from a canonical class combination 6-1-X for CDRs L1-L2-L3. CDR L1 class 6 represents a 14 amino acid loop length, while class 1 (7 amino acids loop) is the only identified group for CDR L2 in the literature [7,41]. Class X is used here to indicate that no canonical class has been reported previously with a similar loop length. The three sampled antibody libraries were analyzed statistically using a chi square goodness of fit test (X 2 ) (IBM SPSS 21) to evaluate whether the canonical class representation was equal within each antibody library. However, the null hypothesis was rejected (p value \u2264 0.001),",

We also investigated the conformational transitions between canonical clusters of all CDR loops. The structural description of the CDR-H3 and CDR-L3 loops is known to be a major hurdle in antibody design because they show the greatest diversity in length and sequence and are located in the center of the binding site. 34 Following the concept of conformational diversity, i.e., that the same antibody can adopt various conformations, some studies suggested that this conformational diversity could also increase the functional diversity of a limited repertoire of sequences, and thereby facilitate the evolution of new antibodies. [35][36][37][38][39] The sequence and structural classification of antibody CDR loops has been the focus of various studies and is still an evolving process due to the increasing number of antibody Fab structures. 5,11,13,17,40,41 The canonical clusters of the CDR loops are diverse in length and sequence composition, and with increasing CDR loop length, their population and predictive value decrease. 20 Additionally, it has been shown for CDR-H3 and CDR-L3 loop ensembles that they should be described as conformational ensembles in solution. 21,22,30 Also, special care has to be taken  when analyzing CDR loops by Fab crystal structures because of distortions due to crystal packing effects. 22,42 Our data, shown in Figure 1a, confirm these observations for the CDR-L1 loop ensemble in solution. The representatives of the L1-11-1 and L1-11-2 canonical clusters 2D7 T and 1ZAN, which were crystallized without antigen, lie in the same kinetic shallow side minimum, while the representative of the L1-11-3 canonical cluster 1W72, crystallized with antigen, belongs to the global free energy minimum in solution. This observation is in line with the very similar sequence profiles of the L1-11-1 and the L1-11-2 canonical clusters, while the canonical cluster L1-11-3 entirely contains lambda light chains.

The final sizes for each of the VH/VL pairs were achieved during the CDR-H3 cloning step and ranged from 4.6E+08 to 4.4E+09 members, which results in an overall library size of 1.3E+11 clones. \n\nThe quality of the library on a sequence level was assessed at three stages during the cloning procedure. This included assessment of sequence correctness as defined by correct reading frames and agreement of the amino acid distributions at the diversified CDR-L3 and CDR-H3 positions with the library design. The first quality control (QC) was performed directly after the synthesis of the CDR-L3 and CDR-H3 library cassettes, prior to their insertion into the respective vector backbones. A second QC step confirmed the VL sequences after the first cloning step (i.e., the insertion of the CDR-L3 cassettes). VL sequences were checked again in a third QC together with VH sequences after the final cloning step (i.e., the insertion of the CDR-H3 cassettes). Each QC step was performed by sequencing at least 30 clones of each of the respective V regions. The average sequence correctness of the intermediate Ig light chain sub-libraries was 85% for all Ig lambda and 86% for all Ig kappa sub-libraries. After the insertion of the CDR-H3 cassettes in the second cloning step, the CDR-L3 sequence correctness remained unchanged and the average CDR-H3 correctness alone of all sub-libraries was 90% resulting in a combined CDR-L3 and CDR-H3 sequence correctness of at least 82% for each sub-library. \n\nThe initial CDR-L3 and CDR-H3 QC also included the comparison of the amino acid composition of each variable position synthesized with that of the library design. As shown in Figure 9, no major deviations between the observed composition in the unselected library and the library design were observed for the CDR-H3 lengths 6 to 17 for roughly 4,000 analyzed sequences.",

            "text": "Antibodies bind their targets using diversified loops, termed complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), with three in each rearranged VH and VL gene. CDRs 1 and 2 are encoded by germline V genes, while CDR3s in both VH and VL are the product of gene recombination. Compared to other CDRs, the varied length and biochemical properties of heavy-chain complementarity-determining region 3 (HCDR3) contribute to enhanced sequence diversity (1). It has been estimated (2) that the theoretical HCDR3 diversity exceeds 10 15 variants, generated from fixed genomic sequences by combinatorial and junctional diversification mechanisms. This underlies the vast diversity of the human antibody repertoire. The fully assembled V(D)J gene and its incorporated HCDR3 are derived from the sequential random assembly of 56 VH, 23 DH, and 6 JH genes (3)(4)(5)(6). While both VH and JH contribute to the HCDR3, the DH forms the central core. Although DH genes are predominantly read in one frame, all three frames can be used (7,8), further increasing potential diversity. It was initially thought that D genes could also be inverted and duplicated (9,10); however, recent deep sequencing results indicate that this is unlikely (7). Diversity is further increased by P-nucleotide-mediated (11) or N-nucleotide-mediated (12,13) addition, or exonuclease-mediated loss (11,14), of nucleotides between the VH/DH and DH/JH segments. Recombination between VH genes after rearrangement provides further diversification although it remains unclear how much this contributes overall (15). \n\nThere is much evidence that the HCDR3 is the major determinant of antibody-binding specificity. Specific antibodies have been selected from synthetic antibody libraries where diversity is restricted to the HCDR3 (16)(17)(18). It has been shown that a greater number of antibodies were selected from a synthetic library containing only HCDR3 diversity than when the same library was combined with LCDR3 diversity (18).",

            "text": "ABSTRACT To support antibody therapeutic development, the crystal structures of a set of 16 germline variants composed of 4 different kappa light chains paired with 4 different heavy chains have been determined. All four heavy chains of the antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) have the same complementarity-determining region (CDR) H3 that was reported in an earlier Fab structure. The structure analyses include comparisons of the overall structures, canonical structures of the CDRs and the VH:VL packing interactions. The CDR conformations for the most part are tightly clustered, especially for the ones with shorter lengths. The longer CDRs with tandem glycines or serines have more conformational diversity than the others. CDR H3, despite having the same amino acid sequence, exhibits the largest conformational diversity. About half of the structures have CDR H3 conformations similar to that of the parent; the others diverge significantly. One conclusion is that the CDR H3 conformations are influenced by both their amino acid sequence and their structural environment determined by the heavy and light chain pairing. The stem regions of 14 of the variant pairs are in the \u2018kinked\u2019 conformation, and only 2 are in the extended conformation. The packing of the VH and VL domains is consistent with our knowledge of antibody structure, and the tilt angles between these domains cover a range of 11 degrees. Two of 16 structures showed particularly large variations in the tilt angles when compared with the other pairings. The structures and their analyses provide a rich foundation for future antibody modeling and engineering efforts.",

Here, we show that all CDR types have structurally similar loops of different lengths. Based on these findings, we created length-independent canonical classes for the non-H3 CDRs. Our length variable structural clusters show strong sequence patterns suggesting either that they evolved from the same original structure or result from some form of convergence. We find that our length-independent method not only clusters a larger number of CDRs, but also predicts canonical class from sequence better than the standard length-dependent approach. To demonstrate the usefulness of our findings, we predicted cluster membership of CDR-L3 sequences from 3 next-generation sequencing datasets of the antibody repertoire (over 1,000,000 sequences). Using the length-independent clusters, we can structurally classify an additional 135,000 sequences, which represents a \u223c20% improvement over the standard approach. This suggests that our length-independent canonical classes might be a highly prevalent feature of antibody space, and could substantially improve our ability to accurately predict the structure of novel CDRs identified by next-generation sequencing.",

Next, we investigated whether CDR L3 and H3 from these antibodies could be sufficient for providing high bispecific yield for other antibody pairs. We selected two antibody pairs that have low bispecific yield, namely anti-HER2/CD3 (22-24%) (Table 1) 21 and anti-VEGFA/ANG2 (24%). 21 CDR L3 and H3 for one arm each of these two BsIgG 1 were replaced with corresponding CDR sequences from either the anti-MET or anti-IL-13 antibodies. A substantial increase in yield of BsIgG 1 (from ~24% up to 40-65%) was observed in three of four CDR L3 and H3 recruitment cases for both anti-HER2/CD3 (Figure 7(a)) and anti-VEGFA/ANG2 (Figure 7 (b)). Thus, recruitment of CDR L3 and H3 from antibodies with a cognate HC/LC pairing preference can enhance the yield of BsIgG 1 with no pairing preference but does not invariably do so. \n\nWhen critical residues for pairing preference for anti-IL-13 were transplanted to the corresponding position in anti-HER2, anti-VEGFA or anti-VEGFC antibodies, some increase in bispecific yield was observed, albeit less than for the parental anti-IL-13/IL-4 BsIgG 1 (Table S4).

This plasmid contains a modified version of the Fab-4D5 gene [27] fused to gene III of the M13 phage (corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal 208 residues of pIII). This fusion protein contains the cysteine residue of the heavy chain hinge region so as to enable bivalent display of the Fab [28]. Most residues in the CDR-L3, H1, and H2 loops were replaced with serine. A TAA stop codon and a unique BamHI site were introduced to CDR-H3. The gene was assembled from a series of synthetic oligonucleotides using PCR. The synthesized gene and the phoA promotor segment were cloned into a phage-display vector, pAS38 [29] in such a way that the heavy chain of the Fab is fused to the carboxyl-terminal 208 residue segment of M13 phage pIII. The expression of both the light chain and the heavy chain-p3 fusion were placed under the control of the phoA promotor.\n\nThe library was constructed as follows. Oligonucleotides that encode biased amino acid mixture (indicated as ''X''s in Figure 1B) for CDR-L3 and H3 were synthesized using a custom-made trimer phosphoramidite mixture (Glen Research, Sterling, VA) on an Expedite synthesizer (ABI) following instructions from Glen Research. After deprotection, the oligonucleotides were purified using acrylamide gel electrophoresis. Oligonucleotides for CDR-H1 and H2 that did not require the use of trimer phosphoramidetes were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies. These oligonucleotides were used to introduce mutations of CDR-L3, CDR-H1, CDR-H2 and CDR-H3 using the Kunkel mutagenesis method [30]. After the initial transformation of the SS320 cells [30], the DNA for the library was purified and digested with BamHI and then used to transform the SS320",

Therefore, our affinity maturation strategy for further improvement was focused on the consensus sequence of CDR-L3.\n\nFirst Affinity Maturation-Two sublibraries were constructed for the first round of affinity maturation. In one sublibrary, mutations were introduced into CDR-L3 only. In the other sublibrary, mutations were introduced into both CDR-L3 and one of the other four CDRs that are spatially close to CDR-L3, namely CDR-L1 and the three heavy chain CDRs. These two sublibraries were cycled through five rounds of binding selections with immobilized SEB antigen under more stringent conditions by successively lowering the concentration of immobilized antigen and more intensive washing. We sequenced only those clones that bound to immobilized SEB in spot phage ELISA and exhibited over 50% inhibition in the presence of 5 nM solution-phase SEB in single-point competition phage ELISA. Twenty-two unique clones were obtained from affinity maturation. Interestingly, all of the improved clones had new CDR-L3 sequences, but most retained the original heavy chain CDR sequences, with CDR-L1 and CDR-H3 being non-mutated in all clones, which was also observed in first generation Fabs. This may indicate that the conformation formed by the parental heavy chain CDR sequences is complementary to the epitope on the antigen that the Fabs interact with, but it could also be due to the design of the template with stop codons embedded only in CDR-L3 and therefore the high occurrence of parental heavy chain CDR sequences.\n\nThe selected Fabs were expressed in 55244 E. coli cells and purified on an rProtein A column. Endotoxin levels were reduced to below 10 Endotoxin Units (EU)/mg by extensive washing of loaded column with nonpyrogenic PBS buffer supplemented with 0.1% Triton 114 followed by nonpyrogenic PBS buffer.

We extracted CDR-H3s from antibody structures found in the Protein Data Bank 31 that are regularly collected by the Structural Antibody Database 22 (Saab).

Numerous reports have described overall CDR H3 length and amino acid composition biases in health and disease and in different B cell developmental stages [6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20] . CDR H3 and junctional segments lengths in the B cell repertoire have been assumed to be independent of V H and J H germline segments except for their lengths prior to recombination 17,19,20 . This assumption has been implicitly used, for example, to generate simulated CDR H3 datasets to estimate the significance of observed clonal convergence in repertoires 20 . Analysis of the impact of V L on CDR H3 length has been limited to CDR L3 length, with negative results 23 . Here we describe detailed, high-dimensional analyses of CDR H3 and junctional segment length distributions and show a complex set of biases determined by V H , V L , and J H germline segment use and B cell   B and T cell repertoires due to differences in mechanisms of antigen recognition. Our results provide a detailed view into the dynamics of heavy chain junctional biases in antibody repertoires that complements previously described dynamics of clonal selection and expansion, convergence, sequence diversity and changes in overall CDR H3 properties in B cell maturation [9][10][11]20,22,25,27,29 . \n\nSpecial consideration was given to the repeatability and robustness of the findings. The results are based on a total of 12 donors in four datasets and confirmed by analysis of 8 additional donors from the SRI dataset. These datasets were obtained and parsed with different sequencing methods and bioinformatic pipelines, minimizing the impact of technical artifacts. Some of the biases, such as those associated with V L , and J H cannot be easily generated by sequencing or parsing artifacts, especially in a systematic fashion across datasets.",

The third complementarity-determining region of the heavy chain (CDR H3) is the region of highest sequence diversity and is formed by the joining of heavy chain VH, DH and JH germline segments combined with random nucleotide trimming and additions between these segments. We show that CDR H3 and junctional segment length distributions are biased in human antibody repertoires as a function of VH, VL and JH germline segment utilization. Most length biases are apparent in the naive and antigen experienced B cell compartments but not in nonproductive recombination products, indicating B cell selection as a major driver of these biases. Our findings reveal biases in the antibody CDR H3 diversity landscape shaped by VH, VL, and JH germline segment use during naive and antigen-experienced repertoire selection. Sankar et al. investigate the junctional length biases (determining antibody binding potential) as a function of germline gene usage in antibody repertoires. They show that CDR H3 and junction length are biased by VH, VL, and JH germline segment usage and these biases are apparent in both naive and antigen-experienced repertoires but not in non-productive repertoires.",

            "text": "The immune repertoire was sourced from lymph nodes from seven different donors, peripheral blood lymphocytes from nine different donors, spleen from one donor, and tonsil RNA from five donors. All six CDRs from donor repertoires were amplified and reassembled into a single light (DP-L3) and heavy chain (VH3-23) framework that is well-presented in the human repertoire and well-expressed in host cells [47]. This approach circumvents loss in diversity due to low expression or the display level of certain germline genes. The library was validated against a range of haptens, peptides, carbohydrates, and proteins and has successfully isolated antibody clones with subnanomolar affinities; in fact, at least five mAbs generated using the n-CoDer TM library have entered clinical trials. The semisynthetic strategy has been refined further by grafting naturally occurring CDRs from human antibodies into frameworks based on well-behaved clinical antibodies, referred to as a Generation Three design [48], in order to address the identification of highly developable therapeutic antibodies directly from the library, CDR-H3 sequences were amplified directly from B cells, while the remaining CDRs were sourced from a large next-generation sequencing dataset and all sequence liabilities eliminated. The resulting scFv library is 9 \u00d7 10 9 in size with the CDR diversity incorporated into 4 VH frameworks, 3 V\u03ba frameworks, and 1 V\u03bb framework [48]. In addition, two in vitro display platforms, phage and yeast display, were implemented to isolate diverse antibodies to clinically relevant protein targets, yielding affinities down to the subnanomolar and picomolar range demonstrating that this approach has the potential to considerably reduce discovery timelines. \n\nIn the early days of antibody phage display, the initial focus was on generating large diverse repertoires (>10 10 transformants) to identify high affinity functional binders, which was subsequently followed by addressing aspects of sequence liabilities via synthetic approaches to resolve developability and expression challenges that occurred with some naturally occurring antibody sequences and errors introduced by initial synthetic approaches, as well as removal of T cell epitopes, for example, by the selection of frameworks that exhibited optimal stability and expression.",

Kappa gene segments are encoded on chromosome 2 (52 V genes and 5 J genes) whereas lambda gene segments are encoded on chromosome 22 (30 V genes and 7 J genes) (16,(19)(20)(21)(22). Depending on the type of light chain, antibodies reveal differences in conformational flexibility, halflife, and specificity (23). Various studies focused on classifying antibody structures and correlated it with their locus and sequence to improve antibody structure prediction and design (24)(25)(26)(27). Additionally there exist several numbering systems for antibodies that are similar in the framework region, but differ around the CDRs (6,(28)(29)(30). The PyIgClassify database classifies conformational clusters by determining the CDR sequences and lengths using the IMGT nomenclature (28) and calculating the dihedral angles \u03c9, \u03d5, and \u03c8 of the residues in each CDR (27). We analyzed the conformational diversity of the CDR-L3 loop to identify transition probabilities and timescales between canonical CDR-L3 loop conformations of same length and to characterize the CDR-L3 loop in solution. We focused on the CDR-L3 loop, because it reveals a diversity in sequence and structure comparable to the CDR-H3 loop.",

Kunkel mutagenesis (Kunkel et al., 1987) was used to replace four CDRs (L3, H1, H2, and H3) in the MBP phagemid with TAA stop codons. The resulting phagemid was sequence verified and used as the template phagemid. The Modified-F library was constructed and stored using previously established protocols (Fellouse and Sidhu, 2006;Rajan and Sidhu, 2012). Kunkel mutagenesis was used to simultaneously diversify four CDR regions (L3, H1, H2, and H3) within the template phagemid. CDRs L3, H1, and H2 were diversified using Library-F mutagenic oligonucleotides. CDRH3 was diversified using 17 J H 4-CDRH3 Library-F mutagenic oligonucleotides and 10 J H 6-CDRH3 Library-S mutagenic oligonucleotides (Oligonucleotide sequences given in Supplementary Table 1). Eight different mutagenesis reactions were required for constructing the Modified-F library, each reaction representing a set of CDRH3 lengths.

Interestingly, further mutational studies on the DE loop of one particular high-affinity 10 Fn3 variant revealed that this loop can be either engineered to improve affinity or stability to a considerable degree. These results underline once more that library design for scaffolds based on immunoglobulin and immunoglobulin-like domains must undergo adjustments based both on the systematic evaluation of na\u20ac \u0131ve libraries and selection outputs in order to efficiently approach an optimum balance of stability and affinity of relevant variant proteins.\n\nThe degree of CDR sequence diversification in combinatorial libraries of antibody-based alternative scaffolds, i.e. the usage of the amino acid repertoire, follows various different strategies. While na\u20ac \u0131ve libraries provide natural diversity by combination of functional V-gene segments isolated from the lymphoid tissues of non-immunized donors [e.g. CAT 1.0 and CAT 2.0 libraries of Cambridge Antibody Technology (108,109)], synthetic libraries such as the HuCALs (Morphosys) offer any desired amino acid compositions in the CDRs (110,111). In general, it was observed that, despite the hypervariability of CDR sequences, there is a bias of functional CDRs to certain amino acid types, most of all tyrosine, glycine, and serine (112). Fellouse et al. showed that while scFv variants binding to some antigens at nanomolar affinities were selected from phage display libraries providing only a binary amino acid repertoire (i.e. tyrosine and serine), selections of binders from the same libraries to other antigens yielded affinities only in the micromolar range (113)(114)(115). Modifications of these libraries included an increased chemical diversity in CDR-H3 and the consideration of non-paratope residues potentially important for CDR conformation (116).\n\nAs mentioned above, Morphosys' HuCAL Fab",

Antibody displaying phage libraries can be either natural or synthetic, or both, depending on the origin of the diversity component, incorporated into the antibody fragment scaffold. Diversity of the natural libraries is provided by the anti body repertoire acquired in the live immune system by gene rearrangement [12]. Each of the three major human immunoglobulin gene loci (one for HC and two -lamb da and kappa, for LC, light chain), contains multiples of variable (V), diversity (D, only for HC) and joining (J) genes. V(D)J recombination, different in each individual lymphocyte, causes one random copy of each type of the gene segment to be sequentially joined together, generat ing 1\u00d710 11 unique heavy chain sequences and an enor mous potential number of na ve paired antibody perhaps in the range of 10 16 10 18 unique antibody sequences [58]. Real diversity of the na ve human antibody repertoire is estimated to be at least 10 12 unique combinations. Since the number of peripheral blood B cells in a healthy adult human is on the order of 5\u00d710 9 , the circulating B cell population samples only a microscopic fraction of this diversity. \n\nAntibody diversity is, mostly, present in their six complementarity determining regions (CDRs), highly variable structural loops undergoing clonal selection in the immune system. Three of them: L1, L2, and L3 are located in VL, and three: H1, H2, H3 -in VH. In gener al, the CDR loops in HC are more frequently involved in antigen binding than those in the LC. Contribution of each of the six CDR loops to antigen recognition is indi vidual and each residue position within a single CDR may play a completely different role depending on the anti gen-antibody complex [59]. Five of the six CDRs of a restricted variety and length from 3 to 15 residues adopt a limited number of backbone conformations, while H3 is longer, more compositionally and structurally diverse [60] and is considered to be the most important for antigen recognition [61].",

Interestingly, CDR-H3s amplified from na\u00efve human donors or from mice seem to exhibit much lower diversity with only 24% to 31% unique CDR-H3 sequences as described by Venet et al. \n\nTo maintain the convenient selection process of high-affinity antibodies established for HuCAL GOLD 21 and PLATINUM, the Fab fragments are displayed by CysDisplay through disulfide linkage to the pIII protein on the phage. More than 300 IgGs against recombinant proteins including soluble peptides and receptors have been identified in various pilot experiments with Ylanthia. Thus, a large amount of data has already been acquired heterogeneity, instability or even loss of function through post translational modifications. 64 Furthermore, the diversified CDR-L3 and CDR-H3 sequences were designed to obtain pI values ranging between 7.5 to 9 for the full-length antibody. This should maximize solubility of the protein in the neutral or slightly acidic formulation buffers routinely used. For antibodies with pI values greater than 9 rapid clearance from the blood and decreased halflife in vivo 65,66 have been described. \n\nFor the generation of Ylanthia, the diversified CDR-L3 and CDR-H3 cassettes were cloned consecutively into each of the 36 Ylanthia VH/VL pairs, without the use of an in-frame selection strategy, resulting in a total antibody library size of more than 1.3E+11 individual members. Thus, Ylanthia is three-fold larger than the previously described HuCAL PLATINUM library 20 and equals the human PCR-derived CAT2.0 library 41 in size. To our knowledge, the quality of Ylanthia, with ~85% accurate clones is among the highest reported to date for recombinant antibody libraries.",

            "text": "Since the identification of antibodies in the 19th century, the rise and importance of monoclonal antibodies as biotherapeutics over the past 30 years has been extraordinary (Carter, 2006(Carter, , 2011;;Reichert, 2017;Kaplon and Reichert, 2019). Antibodies are composed of two polypepide chains, called V H and V L (Edelman, 1973). Each chain consists of a variable and a constant region. The variable domain contains six hypervariable loops, referred to as the complementarity determining regions (CDRs), which shape the antigen-binding site, the paratope (Nguyen et al., 2017). The specificity of an antibody is mainly influenced by the CDR loops and therefore characterization of the paratope is essential for understanding the function of the antibody (James et al., 2003). Five of the six CDR loops, except the CDR-H3 loop, can adopt a limited number of main-chain conformations and have been classified into canonical structures according to their length and sequence composition (Chothia and Lesk, 1987;Al-Lazikani et al., 1997). The highest variability in sequence, length and structure of an antibody can be observed in the CDRs, especially in the CDR-H3 loop, while antibody frameworks are fairly well conserved (\u223c150 human germline framework sequences). The CDR-H3 loop plays a central role in antigen recognition and has on average the highest counts of contacts with antigens (Marks and Deane, 2017;Regep et al., 2017). Structure prediction of the CDR-H3 loop due to its exceptional diversity of both structure and sequence and the ability to adopt various different conformations during V(D)J recombination and somatic hypermutation remains challenging (Bassing et al., 2002;Market and Papavasiliou, 2003;Clark et al., 2006;Burkovitz et al., 2014). Additionally, the CDR-H3 loop length and structure have an effect on the antigen-binding patterns of the CDR loops and influence the specificity of the paratope for target antigens.",

            "text": "Antibodies vary from large, multi-chain and multi-domain complexes, like those found in humans, to small, single domain molecules, such as nanobodies [20]. However, binding always occurs in a similar fashion, through interactions between the antigen and a number of loops on the antibody called complementarity determining regions (or CDRs). In standard mammalian antibodies, there are six of these loops; three on the heavy chain and three on the light chain (labelled L1, L2, L3 and H1, H2, H3 respectively). In contrast, for camelid antibodies, which lack a light chain, there are only three. The CDRs are the most variable parts of the whole antibody structure, and they govern the majority of the antigen-binding properties of an antibody. \n\nThe conformational diversity of five of the six CDRs (L1, L2, L3, H1 and H2) is thought to be limited. For these CDRs, only a small number of different shapes have been observed, forming a set of discrete conformational classes known as canonical structures [21]. Since its proposal in 1987 [21], the idea has been reinvestigated many times as the number of known antibody structures has increased [e.g. Refs. [22][23][24]. These studies have led to the identification of particular amino acids at certain positions that are thought to be structuredetermining; the canonical class of a CDR of unknown structure can therefore be predicted from its sequence with high accuracy. The least diverse CDR is L2, with around 99% of known structures belonging to the same class [24]. \n\nUnlike the other five CDRs, the H3 loop has not been classified into canonical forms; a huge range of structures have been observed (Fig. 1). This is due to how antibody sequences are encoded in the genome. The complete nucleotide sequence coding for an antibody heavy chain is created by combining gene segments from different locations (this is known as V(D)J recombination, after the 'variable', 'diversity', and 'joining' segments).",

We ran design simulations for the antibodies in the benchmark set by sampling the clusters of each CDR evenly (regardless of length) of all clusters represented in the database by 5 or more unique sequences from the same antibody gene (heavy, \u03bb, or \u03ba antibody CDRs). Thus, the % Sampled of native CDR lengths (Fig 4A) is only 23% for the most length-diverse CDR, L1; followed by L3 (50%) and H2 and H1 (both 66%), and L2 (92%), which is the least diverse (a few \u03bb L2 CDRs are length 12). The %Sampled of native CDR clusters is only 10-14% for L1, L3, H1, and H2 and 34% for L2 (Fig 4B). \n\nFor each of the 60 antibodies, we ran 100 design trajectories, each with 100 outer design cycles (Fig 1A ) for each experiment (representing a total of 10,000 full design cycles for each antibody) and analyzed the lengths and clusters of the final decoy from each of the 100 Monte Carlo simulations. The %Recovered is then the number of final decoys out of 100 runs that contain the native length or cluster (Fig 4A ) for any given CDR. The %Recovered of length generally runs parallel with the %Sampled with the least length-diverse CDRs (L2 and H1) having higher length recovery than the others.

As the initial step of affinity maturation for antibody C0020187, block mutagenesis was used to diversify sequences in the CDR regions. Multiple libraries were designed for optimal coverage of sequences in each CDR (Fig. 1B and SI Appendix, Fig. S1). All six CDRs were included in the mutagenesis scheme and optimized in parallel to maximize the sequence space from which variants with improved affinities may emerge, and later recombined. \n\nThese libraries were selected in soluble phage-display selections. Individual clones were sampled from the outputs of each CDR group, and tested as scFvs in periplasmic extracts (21) using a homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence-based epitope competition (EC) assay (22) in parallel with a functional screen, the enzyme inhibition assay (EIA). The EC assay is a measure of how well an incoming scFv is able to compete with the parental antibody for the epitope and is thus a surrogate measure for binding affinity. The EIA assay is a read-out of functional activity, benchmarked against the parental antibody's ability to inhibit the enzymatic activity of ARG2. Together, these assays inform which optimization groups were likely to generate clones with improved affinity and potency over the parent. Optimization in the CDRH1 (H1) and CDRH2 (H2) groups presented with the highest total hit rates, at 43% and 54%, respectively, in the final rounds, whereas CDRH3 (H3) optimization resulted in the lowest hit rates at 12% (Fig. 2). The total hit rate for CDRL2 (L2) at round 3 is 36%, compared to 25% for CDRL1 (L1) and CDRL3 (L3). Interestingly, the hit rates for the VL outputs decreased after round 3, suggesting that there was no further enrichment of higher-affinity clones in these selection groups at the lowest antigen concentration bracket. \n\nUnbiased Recombination of Optimized CDR Regions Using the Shuffle and ShuffleStEP Methods.",

            "text": "The antigen binding site is principally defined by the Complementarity-Determining Regions (CDRs). These regions were originally identified by amino acid sequence variability analysis (Wu and Kabat, 1970;Kabat and Wu, 1971) as highly variable regions within the V-domains. The CDRs were defined prior to our knowledge of the mechanisms by which antibodies are generated and predated the three-dimensional structure solution of antibodies. Once the first Fab structures were solved, it was realized that the CDRs approximately correspond to loops that vary in structure, called hypervariable loops (HVLs). Each V-domain contributes three CDRs to the antigen-binding site: CDR-L1, CDR-L2, and CDR-L3 from the V L and CDR-H1, CDR-H2, and CDR-H3 from the V H . The three CDRs from V H and the three from V L are brought together by non-covalent association of the V-domains at the N-terminal region of the Fv (Figure 3). The remaining portion of the V-domain, i.e., the two \u03b2-sheets and non-HVLs, generally provide structural support to the antigen-binding site, rather than making contact with antigen and are thus referred to as framework regions (FRs). However, the sequence variability observed in the FRs is not irrelevant to functional binding diversity, as it can directly affect CDR loop conformation and the orientation of V H -V L pairing (Foote and Winter, 1992;Abhinandan and Martin, 2010). \n\nGiven the essential variability of the antigen-binding site, which must be capable of recognizing a large array of diverse antigens to fulfill its remit, it was initially thought that each antibody possesses a unique conformation at the antigen-binding site.",

These LC CDR positions were selected because they were identified previously as critical positions for combinatorial mutagenesis in the LC library approach for selecting dual specific clones from antibodies relying heavily on HC CDRs for their primary antigen binding. 6 Phage displaying Fab with alanine mutations in any of three LC CDRs exhibited no detectable binding to IL4, but bound to the anti-gD antibody, indicating that these mutants were indeed displayed on phage, albeit with lower level than the wild type Fab, but their binding to IL4 was severely disrupted (Fig. 1A and B). Therefore, the previously described approach of generating randomized LC CDR libraries will not likely produce dual specific antibodies since the number of amino acid residues available for evolving secondary antigen binding is quite limited. We next mutated individual key residues of LC CDRs as well as surface accessible HC CDRs as previously described, 11,12 and evaluated their role in IL4 binding by determining the relative binding affinity of these alanine mutants compared with wild type hu19C11. The results verified the importance of those LC CDR residues for IL4 binding. However, all tested positions of CDR H2 and half of the CDR H1 and H3 appeared tolerant to mutation (Fig. 1C). \n\nMapping the mutational effects on the modeled structure of hu19C11 indicated an area centered at CDR H2 that tolerated mutation and may be suitable to evolve a second specificity (Fig. 2A).",

            "text": "diverse parts of the antibody (Figure 1). These loops form the majority of chemical interactions with antigens, thus defining the antigen-binding region, the paratope (6). The CDR3 of the heavy chain (CDR-H3) is the most diverse of the CDRs as it is being formed at the join between the V, D, and J gene segments and subject to high levels of hypermutation. As a result of this diversity, CDR-H3 plays a key role in antigen recognition and binding (7). The non-CDR sections of the variable domain are called the framework. Framework positions next to CDRs along with CDR sequence govern the structural shape of the loops (8).\n\nThe properties of antibodies, in particular designable antigen recognition specificity and binding affinity, have made them useful as diagnostics and research agents as well as the most successful class of biopharmaceuticals (10). Although small molecules constitute the largest proportion of potential therapeutics in clinical trials, the antibody market is steadily growing, with new antibody approvals at a rate of about four per year. As of 2016, five out of the 10 best-selling drugs worldwide were recombinant monoclonal antibodies (11).\n\nSuccessful exploitation of antibodies relies on our ability to interrogate their diversity and function. Application of nextgeneration sequencing of immunoglobulin gene repertoire (Ig-seq) to antibody profiling is able to produce comprehensive snapshots of the repertoire diversity (12). However, most Ig-seq techniques are currently unable to perform sequencing of paired heavy-light antibody sequences or to obtain an immunoglobulin gene repertoire solely from antibody-secreting B cells (13)(14)(15). Advances in liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS) now allow high-throughput analysis of serum antibodies at the amino-acid sequence level (16,17). Previously transcriptomics and Ig-seq datasets have been used to deconvolute MS spectra of serum antibodies into constituent full-length entities (18). Such combined Ig-seq and LC-MS/MS techniques have provided new insights in vaccination and autoimmunity studies (19,",

            "text": "Antibody discovery by phage display consists of two phases, i.e., the binding phase and the amplification phase. Ideally, the selection process is dominated by the former, and all the retrieved clones are amplified equally during the latter. In reality, the amplification efficiency of antibody fragments varies widely among different sequences and, after a few rounds of phage display panning, the output repertoire often includes rapidly amplified sequences with low or no binding activity, significantly diminishing the efficiency of antibody isolation. In this work, a novel synthetic single-chain variable fragment (scFv) library with complementarity-determining region (CDR) diversities aimed at improved amplification efficiency was designed and constructed. A previously reported synthetic scFv library with low, non-combinatorial CDR diversities was panned against protein A superantigen, and the library repertoires before and after the panning were analyzed by next generation sequencing. The enrichment or depletion patterns of CDR sequences after panning served as the basis for the design of the new library. Especially for CDR-H3 with a higher and more random diversity, a machine learning method was applied to predict potential fast-amplified sequences among a simulated sequence repertoire. In a direct comparison with the previous generation library, the new library performed better against a panel of antigens in terms of the number of binders isolated, the number of unique sequences, and/or the speed of binder enrichment. Our results suggest that the amplification-centric design of sequence diversity is a valid strategy for the construction of highly functional phage display antibody libraries.",

Three rounds of panning and sequencing occurred, resulting in the expected reduction of sequence diversity in each round as washing procedures intensified to reduce the noise and identify candidate sequences based on phage enrichment. Only the CDR-H3 regions were segmented out. The procedure resulted in 572,647 unique CDR-H3 sequences against the target in round 1, 297,290 in round 2, and and 171,568 in round 3.

We show that CDR H3 and junctional segment length distributions are biased in human antibody repertoires as a function of V H , V L and J H germline segment utilization. Most length biases are apparent in the naive and antigen experienced B cell compartments but not in nonproductive recombination products, indicating B cell selection as a major driver of these biases.

CDRs with different canonical structures were designed for CDR1 and CDR2 of the light and heavy chains, so that the resulting library covers most of the canonical structure combinations as well as the amino acid compositions found in natural antibodies. HuCAL PLATINUM further improved the library design, incorporating the length-dependent amino acid usage in CDR-H3 and the codon optimization for higher expression level. The TRIM strategy is a significant technological improvement over the simple degenerate codon synthesis, yet the method still relies on the random combination of the trinucleotide units, which inevitably introduces some unnatural CDR sequences. Also, both random oligonucleotide synthesis and TRIM suffer from synthesis errors that result in mutations, frameshifts, and/or unintended length variations in CDR (11)(12)(13), resulting in lowering of the functional diversity of the libraries. A novel solid-phase gene synthesis technology (Slonomics\u00ae technology) (30) has been utilized for the generation of CDR diversity with defined amino acid composition and frequency, and higher proportion of functional clones. In one example, a synthetic library with more nature-like CDR sequences was designed and constructed (31). The library has four heavy chain and two kappa light chain frameworks, and the first and second CDRs of the heavy and light chains were based on the germline CDR sequences for the respective framework, with mutations that reflected the somatic hypermutation frequencies found in natural human antibody repertoire at each CDR position. The third CDRs of the heavy and light chains of the library were synthesized to mimic the amino acid frequency at each position of the CDR-H3 and CDR-L3 of the natural human antibody repertoire. As a result, this library has more nature-like sequences, which conceivably have better functionality, stability and folding behavior than libraries with a lot of unnatural sequences (32).",

            "text": "Antibodies are important immune proteins generated during an immune response to recognize and neutralize the pathogen [Janeway et al., 2001]. As illustrated in Figure 1a, an antibody contains two heavy chains and two light chains, and their overall structure is similar. Six variable regions determine the specificity of an antibody to the antigens. They are called the Complementarity Determining Regions (CDRs), denoted as H1, H2, H3, L1, L2, and L3. Therefore, the most important step for developing effective therapeutic antibodies is to design CDRs that bind to the specific antigen [Presta, 1992, Akbar et al., 2022a]. \n\nSimilar to other protein design tasks, the search space of CDRs is vast. A CDR sequence with L amino acids has up to 20 L possible protein sequences. It is not feasible to test all the possible sequences using experimental approaches, so computational methods are needed. Traditional computational approaches rely on sampling protein sequences and structures from complex biophysical energy functions [Pantazes and Maranas, 2010, Lapidoth et al., 2015, Adolf-Bryfogle et al., 2018, Warszawski et al., 2019]. They are generally time-consuming and are prone to get trapped in local optima. Recently, various deep generative models have been developed to design antibodies [Saka et al., 2021, Akbar et al., 2022b, Jin et al., 2022]. Compared to conventional algorithms, deep generative models The orientations of amino acids (represented by triangles) determine their side-chain orientations, which are key to inter-aminoacid interactions. could directly capture higher-order interactions among amino acids on antibodies and antigens and generate antibodies more efficiently [Akbar et al., 2022a]. Recently, Jin et al. proposed a generative model for antibody structure-sequence co-design. Their model addresses two important computational challenges: First is how to model the intrinsic relation between CDR sequences and 3D structures, and second is how to model the distribution of CDRs conditional on the rest of the antibody sequence. However, there is still a large gap to fill before generative models become practical for antibody design. \n\nHere, we identify another three challenges for antibody sequence-structure co-design.",

            "text": "Antibodies have become key players as therapeutic agents and therefore the understanding of the antigen-binding process is crucial (1,2). The antibody binding site consists of six hypervariable loops, each three on the variable domains of the heavy (V H ) and the light chain (V L ) that shape the antigen binding site, the paratope (2)(3)(4)(5). Five of the six antibody CDR loops can adopt a limited number of main-chain conformations known as canonical structures, except of the CDR-H3 loop (6)(7)(8). The CDR-H3 loop, due to its high diversity in length, sequence and structure and its ability to adopt various different conformations during the V(D)J recombination and somatic hypermutation, remains challenging to predict accurately (9)(10)(11)(12)(13). Together with the CDR-H3 loop the CDR-L3 loop is situated in the center of the paratope and contributes to antigen recognition (14). The CDR-L3 loop is similarly diverse, however without the contribution of a D gene the degree of variability is less (15). The CDR-L3 loop reveals a diversity of length and sequence composition due to the recombination of two gene segments V L and J L . The V L segment codes for the residues 1-95, including the first two CDR loops, while the CDR-L3 loop is encoded by the end of the V L and the beginning of the J L segment (16). The most prominent CDR-L3 loop length consists of nine residues and can adopt six possible canonical clusters. The rarest CDR-L3 loops contain 7, 12 and 13 residues and have only one canonical cluster (17,18). However, even due to the increase in the number of crystal structures and consequentially also in canonical structures, the relative populations of the canonical clusters are expected to stay the same (15). There are two types of light chains, kappa and lambda. The genes encoding the two light chains are located on separate chromosomes.",

            "text": "To generate Abs targeting CD151, we used the phage-displayed Library F 37 of synthetic antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) that offers advantageous features for CellectSeq (Figure S1). First, Library F is extremely diverse (> 10 10 unique members) and precisely designed to ensure that most members are stable and well-displayed on phage 38 . Second, the library proves functional for selections with either puri ed antigens 37 or cell-surface antigens 36 and has yielded numerous selective Abs per selections 36 . Third, the library was constructed with a single, highly stable human framework resulting in negligible display bias where most library members are presented at similar levels 37 . Also, the abundances of individual clones in pools enriched for target antigens are highly correlated with relative a nities 39 ; this property enhances NGS analysis based on enrichment ranking, allowing for the identi cation of highly selective and high a nity clones. Fourth, the synthetic Abs are diversi ed at only four complementary determining regions (CDRs; H1, H2 and H3, and L3), which permit standard NGS procedures utilizing primers that anneal to common framework regions in a cost-effective manner (Figure S2 & S3). Fifth, each of the four CDRs is composed of de ned amino acid positions with restricted diversities. Therefore, the NGS data quality can be very accurately evaluated by assessing any deviations from the xed framework or occurrence of unexpected codons at diversi ed positions. For instance, CDRs H1 and H2 contain only six or eight binary degenerate codons and offer a diversity of 64 and 256 unique sequences, respectively (Figure S1D). Conversely, CDRs L3 and H3 are much more diverse in terms of loop lengths (3-7 or 1-17 degenerate codons, respectively), and in terms of sequence composition (encoded by de ned ratios of nine codons encoding nine amino acids). The CDRs L3 and H3 offer a theoretical diversity of the order of 10 7 and 10 17 unique sequences, respectively (Figure S1D). Ultimately, the four CDRs combined offer a practical diversity approximating 10 11 unique clones 37 .",

            "text": "Various reasons support the utilization of nanobodies in monoclonal antibody, bispecific, or chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy developments, such as their distinctive single-chain structure, compact size, and ease of expression and production [29]. In this study, we successfully isolated nanobodies from our synthetic phage display library, which used degenerate codon for CDR randomization. One previous study also used degenerate codon for nanobody CDR randomization but in a ribosome display library with a higher library size (10 11 ) [7]. Ribosome display is not limited by cell transformation and culture constraints, allowing for a much higher diversity for display, but it remains underutilized compared to phage display or yeast display systems, possibly due to its sub-optimal efficiency and fidelity. \n\nIn our workflow of in vitro selection, the phage display library was counter-screened on blocked control wells to reduce the number of unspecific binders. The NGS of both the negative and positive pools enabled the calculation of the specificity scores to explore sequences with low abundance. It is noted that the lack of specificity for the majority of enriched sequences (Figure 2C) is not uncommon, probably because the library was synthetic instead of immune, as observed in previous studies [30][31][32]. In addition, the result showed two of the five selected sequences specifically bound to B7-H3. We also found that 36 clones identified by NGS demonstrated sequence similarities with A6, differing by only one to two amino acids. Similarly, a recent study reported that enriched clones with a high specificity were close homologs, sharing >80% identity in CDR L3 and H3 sequences [30]. The success rate of binder identification based on the NGS specificity score was relatively low. This could be because the selected nanobody sequence adopted different conformations when recombinantly expressed compared to those in the pIII protein fusion form in phage surfaces. Sequencing errors cannot be excluded as one of the potential possibilities of mis-identification. \n\nRecent studies have discovered that the location of epitopes have a significant impact on the mode of action and efficacy of monoclonal antibody [25] and bispecific antibody [33].",

            "text": "Immunoglobulins are a crucial component of the humoral immune system. They are Y-shaped heterodimeric proteins expressed by B cells that are composed of two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains. They can be cell-surface bound as B cell receptors (BCRs) or released into the extracellular environment as antibodies. There is enormous diversity in the immunoglobulin repertoire, which is required to facilitate recognition of a wide variety of different antigen challenges. \n\nVariability in the antigen-binding sites is achieved by V(D)J recombination, combinatorial diversity via heavy and light chain pairing, and the post-activation processes of somatic hypermutation and class switching. There are five heavy chain isotypes (IgM, IgD, IgG, IgE, and IgA), which confer different antibody functions, and two light chain isotypes (kappa and lambda). The most diverse immunoglobulin regions are the six hypervariable complementarity-determining region (CDR) loops, which are held in place by the structural beta-sheet framework regions (FRs) (1). The CDR-H3 has a particularly high diversity, arising from a combination of IGHD gene inclusion, extra nucleotide addition by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), and imprecise joining of the gene segments (2). CDR-H3 is often considered to be the main protein loop involved in antibody specificity (3,4), and this region can be considered a fingerprint for the B cell and its progeny. The CDR-L3 region is similarly diverse, although without the contribution from a D gene, the degree of variability is less. However, light chains can also be important for the binding specificity of antibodies; light chains are swapped during receptor editing to change the specificity of the antibody (5,6). Hence, the contribution of light chains to the antigen-binding sites must not be overlooked. \n\nThe genes encoding the two light chain isotypes are located on separate chromosomes.",

Thus, subtle mutations in this V domain could help reveal diagnostically relevant features that are specific to MS. The V domain contains three non-consecutive CDRs: CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3. These CDRs are flanked by four framework regions (FRs), which provide structural support to ensure that the CDRs can appropriately interact with antigens. The FR regions are highly conserved due to their structural importance, while the CDRs are highly variable, allowing for precise tuning towards specific antigen interactions. Among the CDRs, CDR3 is notable for its exceptional diversity [5]. While CDR1 and CDR2 are located exclusively on the variable gene segment, the CDR3 region is a product of gene recombination. The light chain CDR3 (CDR-L3) is constructed by recombining the V and J gene segments. The heavy chain CDR3 (CDR-H3) is formed through the more combinatorially complex V(D)J recombination. Among the six CDRs that are spread across heavy and light chains, CDR-H3 exhibits the highest variability, and its diversity suggests a central role in determining antigen-binding specificity [5].",

However, increasing knowledge of CDR-H3 structural diversity has shown that the CDR-H3 bulged/extended configuration is difficult to predict solely from sequence (76). The relationship between sequence and structure in CDR-H3 can be important in Ig-seq as current approaches of clonotype assignment are based on CDR-H3 similarity. In this review, we define clonotypes by the presence of identical V, J genes, matching CDR-H3 lengths and CDR-H3 sequence identities greater than 85% (77). However, structural data show that CDR-H3 sequences within distinct clonotypes (sequence-dissimilar) can adopt similar 3D conformations, while those in the same clonotype (similar sequences) can adopt different 3D conformations (Figure 2). This suggests that the sequence alone is not a reliable indicator of similarity/difference between structures and therefore cannot  (29). Complementarity determining region-3 of the heavy chain (CDR-H3) sequences in pair (A) belong to different CDR-H3 clonotypes but adopt very similar structural configurations with a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of ~1 \u00c5. Pair (B) includes germline precursor (4JDV) and matured (3U7W) anti-gp120 antibodies (78,79). Although CDR-H3 sequences of pair (B) are members of the same clonotype, the RMSD shows that their CDR-H3 shapes are structurally distinct (RMSD > 2 \u00c5). CDR-H3 loops and their amino-acid sequences are in purple and cyan colors, mismatched amino acid are in bold. The RMSD of the backbone atom positions of proteins provides a pairwise measurement of the threedimensional dissimilarity between two sets of coordinates where solved or predicted structures are available. Sub-Angstrom RMSD indicates structurally identical shapes, while an RMSD value greater than 2 \u00c5 for a short segment indicates structurally distinct configurations (80). reliably indicate similar/different binding sites,",

Briefly, we compiled a list of 3,325 CDR H3 sequences from diverse IGHV1-69 antibodies from GenBank (Table S3). Additionally, we performed a site-saturation mutagenesis of the CDR H3 of CR9114. Together with the WT CDR H3 sequence of CR9114, a CDR H3 library with 3,606 variants in CR9114 gHC was constructed and displayed on the yeast cell surface. Tite-Seq 18 was then applied to measure the apparent dissociation constant (K D ) values of individual variants to mini-HA (Figure 3A). At the same time, antibody expression level was measured by threeway cell sorting and next-generation sequencing, as described above for the light-chain variant library. The expression score for each CDR H3 variant was normalized such that the score for WT equaled 1 and the mean score for nonsense mutants of CR9114 CDR H3 equaled 0. \n\nAfter filtering out CDR H3 variants with low occurrence frequency or noisy estimation in the apparent K D values (see STAR Methods), 2,162 CDR H3 variants were subjected to downstream analyses (Table S3). These included the WT CDR H3 of CR9114, 206 single amino acid mutants of CR9114 CDR H3, 14 nonsense mutants of CR9114 CDR H3, 73 CDR H3 variants from HA stem antibodies, 245 from non-HA stem influenza antibodies, and 1,623 from non-influenza antibodies. Pearson correlations of 0.71 and 0.61 were obtained between two replicates of Tite-Seq and expression sort, respectively (Figures S4A-S4B), confirming the reproducibility of our results.",

For example, 309 antibodies were identified from the shuffled library that used the same CDR-H3 sequence, but differed in CDR-H1 and CDR-H2.

Recently, many lines of evidences suggest that the quality of synthetic diversity design limits the development success of synthetic antibody hits. The aim of our study is to understand the quality limitation and to properly address the challenges with a better design. Using VH3\u201323 as a model framework, we observed and quantitatively mapped CDR-H3 loop length-dependent usage of human IGHJ4 and IGHJ6 germline genes in the natural human immune repertoire. Skewed usage of DH2-JH6 and DH3-JH6 rearrangements was quantitatively determined in a CDR-H3 length-dependent manner in natural human antibodies with long CDR-H3 loops. Structural modeling suggests choices of JH help to stabilize antibody CDR-H3 loop and JH only partially contributes to the paratope. Our observations shed light on the design of next-generation synthetic diversity with improved probability of success.",

The binding domains of standard antibodies are their variable light (VL) and heavy (VH) domains, both of which present analogous complementarity-determining region (CDR) loops. It has long been known that the VH CDRs contribute more heavily to the antigen-binding surface (paratope), with the CDR-H3 loop providing a major modality for the generation of diverse paratopes. Here, we provide evidence for an additional role of the VL domain as a modulator of CDR-H3 structure, using a diverse set of antibody crystal structures and a large set of molecular dynamics simulations. We show that specific attributes of the VL domain such as CDR canonical forms and genes can influence the structural diversity of the CDR-H3 loop, and provide a physical model for how this effect occurs through inter-loop contacts and packing of CDRs against each other. Our study provides insights into the interdependent nature of CDR conformations, an understanding of which is important for the rational antibody design process.",

Focusing on the CDR-H3/CDR-L3 interactions, when an Arg is present as third residue of the CDR-L3 loop, as in the germline L3-11, it forms more interactions with the CDR-H3 loop rather than when a Tyr or a Ser is in the same position (Fig. 2a). As previously discussed in literature, Arg located in the CDR loops, is a critical determinant for affinity [79][80][81]. In this case, it seems that this residue may play an important role in the stabilization of the CDR-H3 loop, too. \n\nThe CDR-L1 and the CDR-L2 loops also interact with the CDR-H3 loop, even if their contacts are less occurrent than the ones between CDR-L3 and CDR-H3 loop (SI Fig. 7). In our dataset, CDR-L1 loops show quite some differences in sequence and length, whereas CDR-L2 loops share the same length but differ in sequence. Loop length variation is proven to be a valid strategy for affinity maturation of antibodies, since it influences tertiary structure and activity simultaneously [82,83]. However, an enhancement in affinity does not always go hand in hand with a higher stability. In our dataset, for example, the two germlines with longer CDR-L1 loops, L3-20 and L4-1 (respectively 12 and 17 AA) show only few stabilizing contacts with the CDR-H3 loop. Instead, the L1-39 germline, which is also the most stable one, makes the highest number of interactions (SI Fig. 7a).",

            "text": "The fact that convergences are readily detectable in large antibody panels in the form of parallel lineages, and the apparent epitope restriction of antibodies with shared V H /V L use, suggest that CDR H3 in parallel lineage clones may not play a critical role in antigen binding, allowing a wide range of possible CDR H3 sequences compatible with epitope binding. Alternatively, the diverse CDR H3 sequences may represent  structurally distinct solutions for critical antigen interactions with a given epitope and binding mode. The latter possibility would imply that antibodies known to mediate critical antigen interactions through CDR H3 may accept distinct CDR H3 sequences for epitope binding while retaining epitope specificity. \n\nWe tested this with two humanized anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2) antibodies binding different epitopes, hu4D5 and hu2C4, that are known to mediate critical antigen interactions through CDR H3. [34][35][36][37] The CDR H3 surface area buried in complex structures is 187 \u00c5 2 for hu4D5 and 201 \u00c5 2 for hu2C4. In hu2C4, mutation of residues Asn-108, Leu-109, Pro-111 or Tyr-114 (numbering according to the International ImMunoGeneTics information system\u00ae, IMGT\u00ae 27 ) to Ala individually results in reductions of about 100-fold in binding. 35 In hu4D5, the Trp-107 and Tyr-113 residue side-chains contact Her2 through hydrophobic interactions. 36 Both residues make large contributions to the free energy of binding, with \u0394\u0394G values of 5.9 and 5.6 kcal/ mol when individually mutated to Ala. 34 ariants of hu4D5 and hu2C4 were obtained from phage display libraries with randomized CDR H3 sequences, followed by testing of epitope specificity and affinity of variants with diverse CDR H3 sequences. Two sets of libraries were made for each clone. One design randomized CDR H3 sequences with NNK codons whereas the other used a mixture of trinucleotide codons (Suppl. Fig. 6).",

We employ statistical analyses to quantify the diversity of CDRs compared to the framework regions. Comparative analyses across different numbering schemes demonstrates notable variations in CDR definitions. The Kabat and AbM numbering schemes tend to incorporate more conserved residues into their CDR definitions, whereas CDRs defined by the Chothia and IMGT numbering schemes display greater diversity, sometimes missing certain loop residues. Notably, we identify a critical residue, L29, within the kappa light chain CDR1, which appears to act as a pivotal structural point within the loop. In contrast, most numbering schemes designate the topological equivalent point in the lambda light chain as L30, suggesting the need for further refinement in the current numbering schemes. These findings shed light on regional sequence and structural conservation within antibody sequence databases while also highlighting discrepancies stemming from different numbering schemes. These insights yield valuable guidelines for the precise delineation of antibody CDRs and the strategic design of antibody repertoires, with practical implications in developing innovative antibody-based therapeutics and diagnostics. GRAPHIC ABSTRACT HIGHLIGHTS Amino acid distribution analysis conducted on 124,317 sequences archived in the abYsis database showed lower conservation among CDR residues, as defined by Kabat numbering, compared to the framework region. Both LCDR3 and HCDR3 exhibited particularly high levels of diversity compared to the other four CDR loops, highlighting additional functional roles of the CDR3 loops relative to the others. Two distinct residues, L29 and H30, displayed highly conserved hydrophobic side chain characteristics and played unique conformational roles within the CDR1 loop, contributing to the formation of an \u2018M-shaped\u2019 structure. This residue divides the C-terminus CDR1 loop, which was observed to be less conserved and have greater length diversity, and the N-terminus CRD1 loop. The Kabat numbering scheme appears to overestimate the LCDR2 and HCDR2 loops and underestimate HCDR1, only",

            "text": "With extensive repertoires reaching up to 10 11 members, naive libraries have the capacity to generate antibodies targeting a diverse array of antigens. In contrast, immune libraries derive from Bcell antibody repertoires of immunized or immune donors, exhibiting a predisposition to a limited panel of antigens and generally being smaller in size. While adept at addressing specific antigens, immune libraries are less suited for identifying antibody fragments against a broad spectrum of antigens, particularly self-antigens [30]. Synthetic libraries leverage computational design and gene synthesis, affording precise control over the composition of complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) [28]. Designed in silico, synthetic antibody libraries enable the creation of highly diverse libraries with predetermined structural features, incorporating non-natural amino acids. For example, MorphoSys's HuCAL PLAT-INUM library is a synthetic antibody library meticulously designed for optimal diversity and human-like antibody properties. Similarly, semi-synthetic libraries amalgamate CDRs from natural sources with in silico-designed elements. Early iterations of semi-synthetic libraries maintained diversity through various framework genes. For example, in 1992, Hoogenboom and Winter introduced semi-synthetic scFv-antibody phage display libraries, integrating 49 germline VH sequences and a single V_lambda 3 light chain sequence. These libraries, with a size of 1 \u00d7 10 7 , employed the PCR-based randomization of five or eight residues in the CDR-H3 to enhance diversity [33]. \n\ngoing pre-clinical development or progressing through clinical trials. This section delves into a comprehensive discussion of the five phage display-derived antibodies that have received approval for cancer treatment, emphasizing the valuable role of antibody phage display technology in shaping the landscape of the biopharmaceutical industry (Table 1).

For instance, Abicipar pegol, an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibody fragment, has been approved for the treatment of neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration.",

            "text": "A design strategy of mimicking natural diversity using tailored codons was used to closely mimic the human repertoire. Different library generations were described and it could be shown that the restricted diversity in CDR-H1 and CDR-H2 improved the performance of the library whereas highly variable CDR-H3 sequences were advantageous. Affinities in the low nanomolar range were achieved using these libraries. \n\nHoet and coworkers at Dyax combined synthetic diversity in CDR-H1 and -H2 with length and sequence diversity in CDR-H3 from natural origin (Figure 3) [63]. CDR-H1 and -H2 repertoires were designed based on analysis of germlines genes with introduction of hot spot mutations. Those variable parts were constructed with codon-based oligonuceotides to avoid unwanted amino acids and stop codons, with the aim to increase the functional library size. VH3_23 was used as heavy chain acceptor and combined with the full lambda and kappa light chain repertoire. The natural diversity of the CDR-H3 and light chains originated from B-cells of 35 donors having various autoimmune diseases and 10 healthy donors in order to maximize the diversity. The light chain and all three heavy chain CDRs are independently replaceable modules to facilitate affinity maturation. From the phagemid Fab library with a size of 3.5 \u00d7 10 10 and a phage library with a size of 1.0 \u00d7 10 10 , affinities in the subnanomolar range were obtained. Semi-synthetic libraries combine synthetic design and natural sources to different degrees whereas fully synthetic libraries are based on in silico design and de novo synthesis. Three examples are schematically shown. Library A comprises natural diversity within all CDR regions integrated into one selected single scaffold. CDR sequences are gained via PCR amplification from all naturally occurring frameworks (adapted from semi-synthetic N-CoDeR \u00ae library). Library B comprises synthetic diversity in CDR-H1 and -H2 combined by natural diversity within CDR-H3. Whereas one single heavy chain framework was selected, the whole light chain repertoire has been used (adapted from semi-synthetic Dyax library).",

            "text": "The accurate prediction of the conformation of Complementarity-Determining Regions (CDRs) is important in modelling antibodies for protein engineering applications. Specifically, the Canonical paradigm has proved successful in predicting the CDR conformation in antibody variable regions. It relies on canonical templates which detail allowed residues at key positions in the variable region framework or in the CDR itself for 5 of the 6 CDRs. While no templates have as yet been defined for the hypervariable CDR-H3, instead, reliable sequence rules have been devised for predicting the base of the CDR-H3 loop. Here a new method termed Disjoint Combinations Profiling (DCP) is presented, which contributes a considerable advance in the prediction of CDR conformations. This novel method is explained and compared with canonical templates and sequence rules in a 3-way blind prediction. DCP achieved 93% accuracy over 951 blind predictions and showed an improvement in cumulative accuracy compared to predictions with canonical templates or sequence rules. In addition to its overall improvement in prediction accuracy, it is suggested that DCP is open to better implementations in the future and that it can improve as more antibody structures are deposited in the databank. In contrast, it is argued that canonical templates and sequence rules may have reached their peak.",

            "text": "Antibodies are still important molecular probes for detecting \u03b22 agonists in biological and environmental matrices. There have been many studies using phage display technology to produce specific antibodies against various antigens. In this study, specific anti-SAL scFvs were screened from a synthetic antibody library. \n\nIt is important to perform panning with blocking reagents before positive selection, which will significantly reduce the number of non-specific phages. Meanwhile, switching the carrier protein between each panning round reduces the presentation frequency of non-specific motifs of the carrier protein itself. Clone 4D6 showed the strongest binding affinity based on phage ELISA (Figure 1B), hence, we performed a stepwise in vitro affinity maturation procedure to improve the affinity of 4D6. We obtained a 3D model of the 4D6-SAL complex to identify the acids in the CDRs that needed to be mutated. In this model, CDR-H3 and CDR-L3 seemed to be involved in SAL binding. The heavy chain is considered to contribute to antigen binding to a greater extent than the light chain, especially through the CDR-H3 (Chothia and Lesk, 1987). Therefore, mutagenesis in the CDR-H3 was attempted first. We identified two clones, 4D6H1, which had a seven-fold increased affinity, and 4D6H2, which had a two-fold increased affinity. The differences in the affinities of 4D6H1 and 4D6H2 might be caused by the changes in different amino acids. The mutations introduced in 4D6H1 might have contributed to the better positioning of the residues for tighter to SAL than the mutations in 4D6H2. Then, we performed randomization of the CDR-L3 using 4D6H1 as the template. Two clones, 4D6H1L1 and 4D6H1L2, were identified from the CDR-L3 randomized library, with an \u223c25-fold improvement compared to the parental clone 4D6.",

            "text": "Antibodies are Y-shaped proteins produced by the immune system to tag or neutralize foreign substances, called antigens. As shown in Figure 1, antibodies consist of two identical light chains and two identical heavy chains. Each chain has a variable region and a constant region. The tip of the variable region forms the antibody's binding surface, also known as a paratope. This region recognizes and binds to a specific antigen's binding surface called an epitope. The variable regions of each chain contain three hypervariable regions known as the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), denoted as CDR-L1, CDR-L2, CDR-L3 and CDR-H1, CDR-H2, CDR-H3, for the light and heavy chains respectively (highlighted in yellow in Figure 1). The amino acid sequence of the CDRs determines the antigens to which an antibody will bind (O'Connor, Adams, and Fairman 2010). The variable domain of the light chain can consist of 94-139 amino acids, while that of the heavy chain is slightly longer, consisting of 92-160 amino acids (Abhinandan and Martin 2008). Each amino acid is encoded into a 25-character alphabet with 20 characters for the standard amino acids and 5 characters for non-standard, ambiguous or unknown amino acids. \n\nMany natural properties of antibodies are considered when designing optimized antibody candidates against a specific target including binding affinity, binding specificity, stability, solubility, and effector functions. Antibody binding affinity, the property we focus on in this paper, is the binding strength between the antibody and antigen, and is inversely related to the equilibrium dissociation constant K D , a ratio of K off /K on , where K off measures how quickly an antibody dissociates from the antigen target, and K on measures how quickly the antibody binds to the target (Landry et al. 2015). \n\nStudies on protein crystal structures, including antibodies, have been integral in understanding protein-protein interactions, protein function, and therapeutic development. An understanding of how sequence relates to the structure of the variable domains may illuminate the effects on binding properties of antibody-antigen interactions.",

            "text": "ABSTRACT As the current biotherapeutic market is dominated by antibodies, the design of different antibody formats, like bispecific antibodies, is critical to the advancement of the field. In contrast to monovalent antibodies, which consist of two identical antigen-binding sites, bispecific antibodies can target two different epitopes by containing two different antigen-binding sites. Thus, the rise of new formats as successful therapeutics has reignited the interest in advancing and facilitating the efficient production of bispecific antibodies. Here, we investigate the influence of point mutations in the antigen-binding site, the paratope, on heavy and light chain pairing preferences by using molecular dynamics simulations. In agreement with experiments, we find that specific residues in the antibody variable domain (Fv), i.e., the complementarity-determining region (CDR) L3 and H3 loops, determine heavy and light chain pairing preferences. Excitingly, we observe substantial population shifts in CDR-H3 and CDR-L3 loop conformations in solution accompanied by a decrease in bispecific IgG yield. These conformational changes in the CDR3 loops induced by point mutations also influence all other CDR loop conformations and consequentially result in different CDR loop states in solution. However, besides their effect on the obtained CDR loop ensembles, point mutations also lead to distinct interaction patterns in the VH-VL interface. By comparing the interaction patterns among all investigated variants, we observe specific contacts in the interface that drive heavy and light chain pairing. Thus, these findings have broad implications in the field of antibody engineering and design because they provide a mechanistic understanding of antibody interfaces, by identifying critical factors driving the pairing preferences, and thus can help to advance the design of bispecific antibodies.",

            "text": "The CDR-H3 assembly mechanism, regulation and influence on antibody diversity were extensively reviewed in the field [24,36,37]. Recent advances in next-generation sequencing and immune repertoire mining helped us to understand the antibody diversity to a degree to enable man-made variable genes for antibody discovery [7]. In this study, our goal is to understand the components of CDR-H3 diversity in a precisely controlled manner, hoping that the knowledge gained can help rational design of nextgeneration antibody libraries. Unlike many other studies mining immune repertoire, we utilized a well validated IGHV3-23 * 01 dataset [15,16,27,28] to keep variables minimal in our study. \n\nWe observed CDR-H3 length-dependent usage of IGHJ4 and IGHJ6 germline genes in the immune repertoire. The increased usage of IGHJ6 in antibodies with long CDR-H3 loops validated a well-recognized feature of tyrosine enrichment at the junction of DH-JH recombination [38]. Among all human JH gene segments, JH6 is the longest [39], which explained the increased usage of IGHJ6 germline genes in antibodies with long CDR-H3. Likely, tyrosine residues were introduced repeatedly for the continued diversification at the DH-JH junction as CDR-H3 loops become longer. Tyrosine, on one side, is one of the dominant CDR-H3 residues critical for antibody binding specificity [28,38]. On the other side, tyrosine-rich motifs were frequently observed in amyloidogenic proteins such as \u03b22-microglobulin [40,41], suggesting an important role of tyrosine in controlling the integral structure of proteins. Tyrosine motifs at the DH-JH junction likely are not involved in antigen-antibody interactions. In antibodies with long CDR-H3 loops, we hypothesize that tyrosine residues at the DH-JH junction serve a structural role to help assembling and stabilizing the CDR-H3 loop. Such role is currently under-appreciated in the field and it needs to be tested in the future.",

The CDR-L3 loop displays distinct and narrow free energy basins, which show substantially higher transition timescales (Figure 3). This result  indicates higher free energy barriers between the AGless and the AGed CDR-L3 conformation and correlates with the observed reduced conformational diversity. A shallower and broader free energy surface can be found for the CDR-H3 loop, which presents much faster transitions between the AGless and the AGed conformations and accesses more parts of the estimated free energy surface.

            "text": "First, we sought to generate a CDR library with mutations that sample natural diversity while retaining specificity and stability. Several factors went into the design of the CDR library: (1) we restricted the CDR library to a manageable size to avoid combinatorial explosion and to keep the overall number of designs to less than a hundred; (2) to identify CDR homologs from the sequence database, which has over 4 million VH and VL sequences, we narrowed the search using canonical class constraints (for H3, we only considered those having a matching length to the H3 loop of H4); (3) we restricted the number of CDR mutations per loop to two; (4) we retained CDR loops having mutations at sites predicted to be involved in antigen recognition as predicted by the Parapred software program [22] and excluded the rest; (5) after a final filtering step to remove redundant entries, we scored the remaining loops based on the physicochemical properties of the substituted amino acids with respect to the H4 CDR sequence, with the rationale that amino acids with distinct physicochemical properties are more likely show changes in the binding properties (Figure 1). This search process identified CDR loops from 23 different CDR variants (L1: 4, L2: 2, L3: 3, H1: 5, H2: 3, H3: 6) (Table 1). \n\nWe selected antibody frameworks based on their (1) germline usage in the convalescent antibody repertoire and (2) predicted developability properties. An analysis of the immunoglobulin repertoire from infected or convalescent individuals using next-generation sequencing showed that certain germlines (e.g., VH1-69, VH3-30) are preferentially used in targeting viral structural proteins in infectious pathogens such as HIV-1, RSV, dengue, and hepatitis C [25]. Therefore, an important component of our framework selection approach involved analyzing antibodies isolated from the B-cells of SARS-CoV-2 convalescent individuals to identify enriched V-J segments in heavy and light chains.",

            "text": "Previously we reported the design and construction of a synthetic scFv library (OPAL-S) with predefined CDR diversities [3]. The library is based on the VH3-23 (DP47) heavychain scaffold, which binds to protein A from Staphylococcus aureus; therefore, panning of the library against protein A would enrich clones that are amplified rapidly and/or displayed efficiently. Since each CDR of OPAL-S consists of a relatively small number of unique, predefined sequences (~8000 for CDR-H3 and ~1500 for the other CDRs), the change in the relative abundance of virtually all individual CDR sequences can be determined by NGS analysis. The sequence characteristics of the panning-enriched CDR sequences may provide useful information for the design of a novel synthetic antibody library with a more efficient amplification profile. \n\nAfter three rounds of panning against protein A, phagemid DNA was isolated from the panning outputs and the variable heavy (VH) and light (VL and VK) domains were amplified by PCR. Paired-end sequencing of the amplified DNA by Illumina MiSeq\u2122 yielded 1.5-2.3 million sequence reads per domain, from which CDR sequences were extracted. The non-H3 CDRs (CDR-H1, H2, L1, L2, and L3) of OPAL-S were designed by simulating somatic hypermutations on human germline CDR sequences, allowing the identification of the germline origins of the individual NGS-analyzed CDR sequences. \n\nWhen the relative abundances of each ancestral germline CDR sequence in pre-and postpanning repertoires were compared, sequences from several V gene families were enriched or depleted, twofold or more, most conspicuously in CDR-H2 (Figure 2). In CDR-H2, the VH3 germline family sequences were clearly enriched after panning, whereas the VH1, VH4, and VH5 families were depleted (Figure 2b).",

The FR regions are major components of the backbone structure for VH and VL regions in antibodies and can potentially influence the conformation of the antigenic binding loops [15]. However, several practical drawbacks are apparent for diagnostic reagents based on conventional IgG antibodies. The complex architecture and large molecular size (~150 kDa) may result in weak binding when small size protein antigens are not easily recognized by the concave surfaces of CDR loops [16]. Initial attempts to generate single domain antibody fragments by separating expression of individual human VH or VL units was reported to result in solubility problems in aqueous solvents, higher cost and more time consuming process and the requirements for sophisticated protein engineering approaches [17]. Moreover, the failure of recognition of selected mAbs on conserved epitopes of specific antigens due to unbound reactivities mediated by the Fc region may hinder their utility for diagnostic applications [18,19]. \n\nWith the emergence of DNA engineering, surface display has been widely used to discover new antibody fragments as a means for diagnostic and therapeutic applications. An overview of principles in phage display technology, including antibody library construction, biopanning, types of bacteriophages used and antibody fragments applications are further discussed in the following sessions.",

Some clustering of conformations was observed for the shortest lengths; 12 however, for the longer loops, only the portions nearest the framework (torso, stem or anchor region) were found to have defined conformations. 14,15 In the torso region, 2 primary groups could be identified, which led to sequence-based rules that can predict with some degree of reliability the conformation of the stem region. 16,17 The \"kinked\" or \"bulged\" conformation is the most prevalent, but an \"extended\" or \"nonbulged\" conformation is also, but less frequently, observed. The cataloging and development of the rules for predicting the conformation of the anchor region of CDR H3 continue to be refined, producing new insight into the CDR H3 conformations and new tools for antibody engineering. 12,13,18 urrent antibody modeling approaches take advantage of the most recent advances in homology modeling, the evolving understanding of the CDR canonical structures, the emerging rules for CDR H3 modeling and the growing body of antibody structural data available from the PDB. Recent antibody modeling assessments show continued improvement in the quality of the models being generated by a variety of modeling methods. 19,20 Although antibody modeling is improving, the latest assessment 21 revealed a number of challenges that need to be overcome to provide accurate 3-dimensional models of antibody V regions, including accuracies in the modeling of CDR H3. The need for improvement in this area was also highlighted in a recent study 18 reporting an approach and results that may influence future antibody modeling efforts. One important finding of the antibody modeling assessments was that errors in the structural templates that are used as the basis for homology models can propagate into the final models, producing inaccuracies that may negatively influence the predictive nature of the V region model.",

            "title": "High Affinity, Developability and Functional Size: The Holy Grail of Combinatorial Antibody Library Generation",
            "text": "Over the past 15 years the generation of therapeutic antibodies from combinatorial antibody libraries has been established as a valid alternative to conventional immunization. To isolate candidates from such libraries the antibodies or antibody fragments are displayed on the surface of cells, phages, ribosomes or within the cell. Among those display methods, phage display has the longest history and it is among the technologies most commonly used today. While the choice of the antibody format can be limited by the display method, e.g., to the scFv or the Fab in the case of phage display, library design is in principle independent, as long as sufficient expression properties in the respective host system are ensured. \n\nCombinatorial antibody libraries differ in design, origin of sequence diversity and method of generation. All three aspects have an impact on the most essential features of a library: its size and functional diversity reflected in the ability to deliver high affinity antibodies with good biophysical properties. Antibody libraries can be classified into three major groups: na\u00efve, semi-synthetic and synthetic libraries. Most libraries aim at maximizing library diversity, but differ in their approaches of maximizing functional size and subsequent developability of the selected molecules. Limitation to a single stable framework or to a selected number of consensus frameworks to ensure good biophysical properties is one trend in this context. Currently there is a trend to be as close to human germline as possible, both in the choice of framework and CDR composition, to avoid potential issues of immunogenicity. \n\nWith the synthetic library of moderate size described by Pini and coworkers, scFvs were selected with monovalent affinities down to 10 nM [57]. Affinities achieved with large semi-synthetic libraries described by Hoet and S\u00f6derlind reached the sub-nanomolar range, whereas antibodies in the lower picomolar range have been isolated directly from the fully synthetic HuCAL PLATINUM \u00ae library as well as the very large na\u00efve CAT2.0 library. Affinity improvement factors vary widely within each method and are highly dependent on both the antigen as well as the starting molecule. The approaches targeting CDR regions have advantages concerning functional size of maturation libraries and integrity of antibody framework.",

CDR2 had 7 to 8 aa, and CDR3 had 15 to 16 aa. The dominant length for CDR2 and CDR3 was 8 aa and 15 aa, respectively. The distribution of the LC CDRs was also varied, with 6 and 8 aa for CDR1 and 3 aa for CDR2. However, the length range for CDR3 was broader, from 11 to 13 aa, with 11 aa as the dominant length (data not shown).\n\nAmino acid propensity for the enriched scFv CDR regions was observed, and a Pivot chart analysis was performed to study the distribution patterns. Some regions showed random aa distributions, while others showed a skewed aa representation for heavy and light chains ( Figure 3). The HC CDR1 showed a higher representation of serine, phenylalanine and asparagine, while HC CDR2 showed a dominance of serine, glycine and isoleucine. The highly diverse HC CDR3 showed an over-representation of serine, leucine, aspartate and phenylalanine. Meanwhile, for LC, the aa of CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3 regions were random but significantly increased in serine. In addition, the LC CDR3 region also showed good frequencies of aspartate, phenylalanine, and valine.\n\nThe aa polarity distribution data of the enriched antibody clone was analyzed (data not shown). All the CDRs in both chains except for CDR-L2 showed similar distribution patterns with higher representation of neutral and small aa. CDR-H1 and CDR-H3 have a similarly high presence of non-polar and relatively large aa. CDR-H3 and CDR-L3 also have a significant non-polar and relatively small aa.

            "text": "Antibodies can recognise virtually any given molecule mainly by variation in the length and sequence of their Complementarity-Determining Regions (CDRs), which form the antibody's binding interface. Three CDRs are found in the antibody's Heavy chain (CDR-H1, -H2, -H3) and three in the Light chain (CDR-L1, -L2, -L3). The first definition of CDRs was by Wu & Kabat (1970) while performing an analysis of the variable domains of Bence-Jones proteins and myeloma Light chains. Later, Kabat and colleagues compared the sequences of the hypervariable regions in the then known structures and observed that at 13 sites in the Light and 7 in the Heavy chains (Kabat, Wu & Bilofsky, 1977), the residues are conserved. They suggested that these positions in the sequence are involved with structure rather than specificity, introducing for the first time a possible relationship between sequence and loop conformation in antibodies. A second set of observations of the crystal structures of Fab fragments and myeloma proteins revealed that, in many cases, hypervariable regions with the same length but different sequences have the same main chain conformation (de la Paz et al., 1986). \n\nIt was in 1986 (Chothia et al., 1986) that specific residues were directly associated with the conformation of the hypervariable regions during a visual analysis of the sequence and structure of antibody D1.3, thus introducing the notion of the \"canonical model\". From this point, various further studies enriched the table of structurally-determining residues (canonical residues), by observing the amino acid similarities at key interacting positions within sequences of members of any given conformational class, of the known and newly defined canonical structures, for the three CDRs in Light and the first two in Heavy chains (Chothia & Lesk, 1987;Chothia et al., 1989;Chothia et al., 1992;Barr\u00e9 et al., 1994;Tomlinson et al., 1995;Guarne et al., 1996;Martin & Thornton, 1996;Morea, Lesk & Tramontano, 2000;Vargas-Madrazo & Paz-Garc\u00eda, 2002).",

            "text": "Pini and coworkers used VH3_23 heavy chain and the light chain corresponding to the V\u03ba3_20 germline for its expression and stability properties [57]. Defined positions were randomized in CDR-L3 and CDR-H3, resulting in a library size of >3 \u00d7 10 8 . 88% of the clones were shown to express a functional antibody and scFvs were selected with monovalent affinities down to 10 nM [57]. \n\nThe principle of the n-CoDeR \u00ae scFv library (BioInvent) is also based on the use of a single, stable framework, namely VH3_23, combined with V_lambda (DPL3) (Figure 3) [58,59]. In contrast to the library by Pini, natural CDRs were used for the generation of diversity. Sequences encoding in vivoformed CDRs from rearranged immunoglobulin genes of different germline origin were combined into one single master framework by amplification of CDRs with primers and overlap extension. Due to the fact that only one fixed framework was used, CDRs from other germlines were combined with this fixed framework. CDRs were amplified from B-cells of several donors and from several different tissues including lymph nodes and PBMCs. The assumption was that these CDRs might contain fewer T-cell epitopes compared to an in silico design, due to the proofreading mechanism they underwent in vivo. The initial library had a size of 2 \u00d7 10 9 , which has increased by one order of magnitude and delivered affinities in the sub-nanomolar range. \n\nA similar framework was also used by Lee and coworkers to construct libraries with completely synthetic CDRs displayed on a single scaffold [60]. They based their library on the framework of the humanized 4D5 antibody (Herceptin \u00ae ), a framework derived from VH3_23 and V_kappa). A design strategy of mimicking natural diversity using tailored codons was used to closely mimic the human repertoire.",

            "text": "Next, we applied a homolog-scan strategy to investigate the functional contributions of individual side chains involved in antigen-antibody interactions in the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of GC058. Homolog-scan combinatorial mutagenesis introduces subtle mutations in the CDR sequences of the parental antibody, providing the potential for fine-tuning the existing interactions at the antigen-antibody interface. As a result, antibodies with higher binding affinities or specificities could potentially be obtained under conditions with controlled stringency during selection. \n\nIn library F, from which GC058 was isolated, diversity was only introduced into the 3 heavy chain CDRs and light chain CDR3. 22 Thus, for the homolog-scan analysis we constructed a single library that targeted a total of 30 residues in these 4 CDRs (Fig. 2). We replaced the wild type codon in each scanned position with a binary codon that encodes only the wild type and a similar amino acid, as described previously. 23 The library  39 Residues in specificity-tuned clones that are different from the parental clone GC058 are shown in white with black background. The signal ratios of Fab-phage bound to L55F vs. WT in phage ELISA (L55/WT) were determined as the mean values from 3 independent measurements. contained 5.8 \u00a3 10 9 unique members, which exceeded the number of all possible theoretical combinations encoded by the binary degenerate codons (1.1 \u00a3 10 9 ) by approximately five-fold, thus providing good sampling of the theoretical diversity. \n\nPhage pools from the homolog-scan library were subjected to 2 parallel selections. Display selection against the anti-FLAG antibody M2 was performed to quantify display biases, since a FLAG tag was fused to the C terminus of the phage-displayed Fab light chain. Statistical analysis of the clones identified from this selection can reveal amino acid preferences at each position for Fab display on phage particles. Following four rounds of selection for binding to anti-FLAG antibody M2, 40 unique binding clones were sequenced. Functional selection was performed to isolate GC058 variants capable of binding to L55F with higher specificity.",

            "text": "It is possible that by adopting extreme tilt angles the structure modulates CDR H3 and its environment, which apparently cannot be achieved solely by conformational rearrangement of the CDR. Note that most of the VH:VL interface residues are invariant; therefore, significant change of the tilt angle must come with a penalty in free energy. Yet, for the 2 antibodies, the total gain in stability merits the domain repacking. \n\nOverall, the stability of the Fab, as measured by T m , is a result of the mutual adjustment of the HC and LC variable domains and adjustment of CDR H3 to the VH:VL cleft. The final conformation represents an energetic minimum; however, in most cases it is very shallow, so that a single mutation can cause a dramatic rearrangement of the structure. \n\nIn summary, the analysis of this structural library of germline variants composed of all pairs of 4 HCs and 4LCs, all with the same CDR H3, offers some unique insights into antibody structure and how pairing and sequence may influence, or not, the canonical structures of the L1, L2, L3, H1 and H2 CDRs. Comparison of the CDR H3s reveals a large set of variants with conformations similar to the parent, while a second set has significant conformational variability, indicating that both the sequence and the structural context define the CDR H3 conformation. Quite unexpectedly, 2 of the variants, H1-69:L3-20 and H3-53:L4-1, have the 'extended' stem region differing from the other 14 that have a 'kinked' stem region. Why this is the case is unclear at present. These data reveal the difficulty of modeling CDR H3 accurately, as shown again in Antibody Modeling Assessment II. 21 Furthermore, antibody CDRs, H3 in particular, may go through conformational changes upon binding their targets, 34 making structural prediction for docking purposes an even more difficult task. Fortunately, for most applications of antibody modeling, such as engineering affinity and biophysical properties, an accurate CDR H3 structure is not always necessary. For those applications where accurate CDR structures are essential, such as docking, the results in this work demonstrate the importance of experimental structures.",

            "text": "The finalized CDR oligonucleotide sequences were array-synthesized (27,911 sequences in total). The oligonucleotides were 136 nucleotides in length, including adjoining framework sequences and common adaptor sequences for PCR amplification at both ends. The synthesized oligonucleotide pool was amplified by PCR using a pair of common primers specific for the adaptor sequences, and each CDR (CDR-H1, H2, H3, L1, L2, and L3) was re-amplified from the amplified pool using framework-specific primers. CDR-H3 was designed with a wide range of lengths (9 to 16 amino acids [aa]). In the previous generation library, OPAL-S, we observed that shorter CDR-H3s were overrepresented in the final library [3], likely due to more synthetic errors in longer CDRs and the growth advantage for the clones with shorter CDR-H3s. In an effort to reduce this bias, the amplified CDR-H3 oligonucleotides were separated by length using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), and CDR-H3 oligonucleotides with different lengths were retrieved separately from excised gel bands. Parallel DNA synthesis introduces errors, among which nucleotide insertions and deletions (indels) are most prominent [24]. Indels introduce frameshifts that lead to premature termination of translation and reduce the effective diversity of antibody libraries. In order to minimize the occurrence of indels in the final library, single-CDR libraries (i.e., focused libraries in which only a single CDR is diversified using the amplified oligo pool) were constructed and subjected to a round of panning against protein A. Since protein A binds to the VH3-23 scaffold, clones that express and display full-length scFv are enriched preferentially, and CDR sequences with indels are depleted concomitantly. The selected CDR sequences from the post-panning single-CDR libraries were assembled to construct the final scFv library, OPAL-T.",

A DRR greater than 1 indicates that the length or cluster was present in the output decoys more frequently that it was sampled during the trajectories. The DRRs for the length of CDRs are highest for L1 and H3 with values of 2.5 and 1.5 respectively. We do not expect high DRRs for L2, H2, and H1 since their length diversity in the PDB is very limited in the first place. \n\nThe DRRs for the clusters are much higher. For the opt-E protocol, the cluster risk ratios are above 2.4 for all 5 non-H3 CDRs, and over 3.5 for L3 and H1. The results demonstrate the utility of the DRR in accounting for the different levels of diversity in length and cluster across the five CDRs in which GraftDesign was enabled. This result may come from both more favorable interactions and higher shape complementarity with the antigen-antibody interface using the native cluster(s), as well as local CDR-CDR interactions, which help to enrich certain lengths and clusters together. \n\nThere is a possibility that Rosetta scores some CDR structures more favorably than others because of internal interactions within the CDR or interactions with other CDRs or the framework. Some rare clusters may be high in energy or even artifacts of highly engineered antibodies or errors in structure determination. To investigate this, we performed the opt-E protocol without the antigen present in the simulations. We calculated an antigen risk ratio (ARR) from Eq 2 as the ratio of the frequency of the native length or cluster in the final decoys from the antigen-present simulations and the frequency of the native in the final decoys from the antigen-absent simulations: \n\nwhere %Recovered (with antigen) and %Recovered (without antigen) are calculated from 100 design decoys of 60 antibodies (6000 structures each).",

            "text": "The earliest experimental synthetic antibody repertoire was based on single V H and V L scaffolds, introduced limited diversity into the CDR-H3 alone and was used to generate moderate affinity hits against haptens (Barbas et al., 1992(Barbas et al., , 1993)). This library exploited basic knowledge of antibody structure and diversity by placing random amino acid diversity into the exposed regions of the CDR-H3. Amino acid randomization was made possible by the use of PCR and oligonucleotides containing degenerate DNA sequence in the appropriate CDR-encoding codons. The simplest forms of degenerate codons used are based on random incorporation in the first two bases, followed by restricted incorporation in the third position to either G/T (\"NNK\" codon) or G/C (\"NNS\" codon). Both of these schemes predominantly incorporate functional diversity, as they encode for 32 codons total, including only one of the three stop codons (amber) and encoding all 20 amino acids, although not at equal ratio. These codons therefore incorporate a reasonable number of translatable polypeptide sequences, so long as the number of contiguous codons used is not so many that one stop codon would be expected per clone. One complicating factor is the obligate encoding of cysteine by each of these codons, leading to a significant number of clones in which thiol groups are presented unpaired, leading to loop malfunction and reducing the overall functional content of the library. \n\nThis very simple method of diversification of key CDR loops was exploited by a series of teams (Griffiths et al., 1993(Griffiths et al., , 1994;;Viti et al., 2000;Silacci et al., 2005), who used similar methods to diversify both the CDRs H3 and L3 in a variety of FRs, while maintaining key loop stem residues in the CDR-H3 such as Kabat 93,94,101,and 102. Despite the simple nature of these repertoires, they have been highly successful at generating antibodies to proteins, peptides, and haptens.",

            "text": "Importantly, processes for identification and development of antibodies with appropriate properties in terms of \"Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Control\" have also been developed (13,14) to ensure that a potential drug candidate can actually be turned into a viable commercial product. \n\nThe biophysical properties of antibodies as well as the affinity and specificity of the binding site can be affected by diversification of the variable (V) domains and subsequent selection of variants that display appropriate properties. Such modulation of antibody properties is often achieved by random mutagenesis, directed mutagenesis primarily of residues in complementarity determining regions (CDRs) (based on the assumption that CDRs carry much of the specificity-determining diversity of human antibodies), DNA shuffling, or chain shuffling, and subsequent selection of variants with improved properties. Selection can be achieved using a diversity of technologies like those relying on display on phage, yeast, or bacteria and the processes can achieve substantial maturation of e.g. the affinity, which may translate into improved performance in a given therapeutic setting. Ribosomal display even carries an inherent ability to evolve genes during the selection procedure (15) thereby advancing a maturation process, as selection from an original library proceeds. Given the potential size of molecular diversity space, it is only possible to assess a very limited fraction of that space in any given experiment. It is thus important to limit diversity to that acceptable for appropriate protein folding, as only such diversity is likely to deliver a functional product and thereby an appropriate outcome of the evolution process. Furthermore, it is envisaged that minimal diversification away from human antibody sequences that commonly occur in vivo is preferred in order to minimize the likelihood that the protein will be immunogenic and able to induce an anti-drug immune response during clinical use.",

Not surprisingly, the highly enriched clone (1B12) with CDR-H3 sequence N 95H YGGTAS 100aH had k off value that was more than 5 times slower than that of the parental antibody. The combination of the V H of 1B12 and V L of 1A12 further improved k off and K D slightly. \n\nThe humanized, affinity matured anti-HER2 clones showed inhibitory activity on the growth of HER2-positive gastric cancer cell lines in vitro and in vivo xenograft models (Figs 2  and 5). The inhibitory activity did not reflect the improvement in the binding affinity, however, and their maximal growth inhibition and IC 50 values were comparable to those of the parental hz1E11, possibly because the hz1E11 already had sufficiently high inhibitory activity on HER2-overexressing cancer cell lines. This does not necessarily mean that they would have similar clinical efficacies, and the effect of the affinity improvement of hz1E11 on the growth of HER2-positive human tumors needs to be evaluated in future development research. The in vivo efficacy may also be enhanced by higher antigen-binding affinity. The affinity of 1A12 can be further improved by e.g. the diversification of the CDRs other than CDR-H3 and CDR-L3, or selection of optimal CDR-H3 sequence in the context of 1A12 light chain sequence. \n\nTo summarize, an anti-HER2 murine antibody, 1E11, was humanized and affinity matured through extensive library construction, panning, and screening efforts. High-stringency, antigen-limiting selection conditions facilitated the isolation of affinity matured clones, among which the best ones were CDR-L3 variants. Different CDR diversification strategies produced different sequence enrichment patterns, with varying degrees of success in affinity improvement. On the other hand, the stringency of panning had similar effects on the output pattern for all the libraries.",

            "text": "The two available crystal structures of the Fab e6 share the same sequence, but show significant differences in the CDR-  H3 and CDR-L3 loop conformations (SI Figure S1). With our approach we observe transitions between the different CDR-H3 and L3 conformations in solution. The structural cluster analyses in Figure 1 show various conformational transitions between the crystal structures, which correspond to the highly populated clusters of the CDR-H3 and the CDR-L3 loops. These structural changes can be understood in terms of conformational selection because, even without the antigen present, the conformation involved in the binding process can frequently be accessed. 22,23 Additionally, the CDR-L3 loop shows fewer clusters by using a smaller distance cut-off compared to the CDR-H3 loop, indicating a higher flexibility. Figure 1 (bottom) emphasizes the structural diversity and the high flexibility of the CDR-H3 loop. To further visualize the increased flexibility of the CDR-H3 loop and to emphasize the role of the CDR-L3 loop in the antigen-binding process, the kinetics of the CDR loops were reconstructed (Figure 3). When the crystal structures were projected into the estimated free energy landscapes in solution, the AGed structure is located close to the minimum in the free energy surface. \n\nTo rationalize the surprising finding that the AGless crystal structure does not correspond to the dominant structure in solution (cf. Figure 3), the symmetry mates of the AGless Fab crystal structure (PDB: 3V6F) are shown in Figure 12 with the aligned AGed Fab crystal structure (PDB: 3V6Z). Figure 12 illustrates the interaction in the AGless antibody crystal structure of the symmetry mate's tail region with the CDR-H3 loop and clearly shows the involved rearrangement of the CDR-H3 loop. The results in Figure 3 show a conformational selection in both directions because the AGless antibody is actually bound to the tail region of a symmetry mate Fab in the crystal. Indeed, the AGed conformation is actually the most important conformation in solution, indicating that the antibody binding site is optimized to bind the antigen.",

            "text": "This present study characterizes the conformational ensemble of the CDR-L3 loop and investigates conformational transitions between different canonical clusters of same length. Structural description of the CDR loops, especially the CDR-H3 and the CDR-L3 loops, are known to be a major challenge for in silico development of antibody biotherapeutics because of their diversity in length, sequence and structure (67). Another study focused on characterizing the stability of antigen-binding fragments in dependency of different heavy and light chain pairings and the respective effect on the CDR loop conformational variability. The concept of canonical structures was supported by this investigation, suggesting that the structural repertoire could be diversified by extending beyond the human germline usage (68). The concept of conformational diversity of antibodies and the ability of the same antibody to adopt various conformations was proposed by Pauling and Landsteiner and demonstrated by Milstein and Foote (69)(70)(71)(72). \n\nThe idea of having ensemble of pre-existing conformations out of which the functional ones are selected was supported by FIGURE 5 | Conformational transitions of the CDR-L3 loop within the obtained 8.5 \u00b5s trajectories. This plot shows the number of clusters as a function of frames. The vertical lines in this plot show transitions between the clusters during each 100 ns of molecular dynamics simulations and are colored according to the cluster the simulation was started from. The canonical cluster medians can be observed within the CDR-L3 loop ensemble in solution. Within simulated cluster 4, which is the least populated cluster, the predicted canonical structure medians with the PDB code 1JGU and 3B5G are present. The canonical structure with the PDB code 1I7Z can be found in simulated cluster 1. population shift models originating from the Monod-Wyman-Changeux model (73)(74)(75)(76)(77). This new view on proteins, i.e., that one sequence can show high structural diversity, facilitated the understanding and evolution of new functions and structures (71). Proper characterization of the CDR loops, especially the loops which are mainly involved in the binding process, is crucial to understand protein-protein interactions and antigen binding.",

The antibody paratope is formed by the heavy (H) and light (L) chains CDRs: CDR-H1 (25-SER to 37-VAL), CDR-H2 (53-GLY to 61-ASP), CDR-H3 (95-ASP to 102-TYR), CDR-L1 (31-SER to 37-GLN), CDR-L2 (49-HIS to 58-VAL), and CDR-L3 (88-CYS to 97-THR) (Residue numbering is according to Chothia et al. 30 ) The monoclonal antibody has a structure with low flexibility. In MD results, in general, there are no major changes in the global structure of the bound and free states (Figure 6, in gray) taking into consideration that the sampling acceleration was applied only to the CDRs, which are the regions of antigenic interest and carry out specific interactions. In this sense, we observed some flexibility in the loops of the F8.12.19 Fab paratope (Figure 7c), and the most significant conformational variability was observed in CDR-H3. \n\nThe low flexibility in the paratope may to avoid entropic losses during the interaction with the antigen and provide a precise three-dimensionality presentation of key contacts, thus allowing a rapid association. 31 CDRs play a fundamental role in antibody specificity and antigen recognition. Among the 6 loops that form the paratope, 5 adopt canonical conformations that are well characterized and facilitate computational work such as modeling and prediction. 32 Studies 33,34 show that CDR-H3 presents greater structural and conformational variability, even in comparison with different organisms, and may contribute to increased contacts. 35 The RMSF graphs indicated that these characteristics were well described in MD, in which only CDR-H3 exhibited more appreciable plasticity with a decrease in RMSF in the presence of the epitope in the bound state. We can also say that there is still room for computational studies in the antibodies field, and a larger sample space will help us understand how these interactions happen at the molecular level. 36",

Thus, special care has to be taken when characterizing antibody CDR-H3 loops based on \"unbound\" Fab X-ray structures. 24 urthermore, it was shown that one single static structure is not enough to capture the high flexibility of any of the CDR loops.",

            "text": "2.1 PRELIMINARIES Since nanobodies can be considered as a single heavy chain of an antibody, we will use antibodies as an example in the following discussion. Proteins are composed of 20 different amino acids. For a given protein of length N , the protein sequence can be represented as S = {s i } N i=1 , where each s i denotes a residue. The three-dimensional structure of the protein can be represented by the threedimensional coordinates of the backbone atoms, denoted as X = {x i,\u03c9 } N i=1 , where each x i,\u03c9 \u2208 R 3 and \u03c9 \u2208 {C\u03b1, N, C, O}. Antibodies are specialized proteins that consist of two distinct chains, while nanobodies contain only a single heavy chain. Each chain is composed of four framework regions (FRs) and three complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), The CDRs of each chain can be further divided into three segments: CDR H1, H2, H3 for the heavy chain, and CDR L1, L2, L3 for the light chain. An antigen-antibody complex can be represented as \n\nwhere H : L \u2212 A represents the heavy chain and light chain of the antibody, as well as the chain of the antigen, l represents the length of the amino acid sequence for each chain. In the case of a nanobody-antigen complex, the light chain is not included. \n\nPrevious studies have defined the antibody design problem as selecting a framework region (Shin et al., 2021;Akbar et al., 2022) to design the CDRs to create antibodies that can bind to specific antigens. Since the influence of the framework region on the antigen-antibody interaction is relatively minor, earlier research has primarily focused on designing the CDRs, often assuming that the structure of the framework region is fixed and unchanging. However, when faced with a completely new antigen, the structure of the resulting antibody, including the framework region, is unknown and cannot be predetermined. IgGM considers structural changes in the framework regions during the binding process, enabling the design of the whole antibody structure even without experimental structures.",

            "text": "this class is not pre-disposed to binding haptens as a group. CDR length comparisons revealed high conservation in CDRs H1, H2, and L2, but much more variability in CDRs L1, H3, and L3 (Table 3). Whereas the post-selection clones CDRs have shown high level of length conservation to accommodate each hapten. A CDR H3 with 12 amino acids was observed with SQA, POR, and HSL post-selection clones (Table 3). Anti-haptens antibodies with 12 amino acid CDR H3 have been reported previously against arsenate and phosphorylcholine [51], and it has been postulated that this is the minimum length to enable CDR H3 to form part of a pocket-like binding site. Interestingly, where CDR H3 lengths are 13 amino acids or greater, it has also been postulated that they become increasingly exposed to solvent, resulting in a more unstable structure and less defined binding site [52].\n\nAntibody-antigen sensitivity is of course greatly influenced by the type of amino acids in contact with the different hapten targets. Analyses of the pre and postselection sequences revealed more conserved sites in the post-selection sequences, when compared to their preselection counterparts, especially within the FW regions (Table 5). This type of conservation phenomenon has been reported previously but to a lesser extent (17 conserved sites), following examination of the 76 common core residues of~5300 Kabat sequences of antibodies to a full range of different antigen classes [53]. One possible reason for the very high level of conservation we have seen is as an artefact of the antibody isolation process. Phage enrichment is known to be significantly influenced by toxicity and expressibility of the displayed antibody binding sites [54,55]. However, the conserved positions seen here are consistent even across clones isolated from different libraries, or from structurally dissimilar haptens or different panning strategies. The only shared factor here is the overall low molecular weight of the haptens and the need to form a binding site shape able to accommodate them. These structural and topographical perquisites could drive high conservation in the FW regions, especially FW3, and result in the selection of clones from only a small",

            "text": "The frequencies of these motifs vary across the different germline libraries and emerge with higher frequencies when they are present in the germline CDR sequences. For example, V H 5-51 CDR-H2 has a DS motif in its germline sequence and the library design would result in this motif appearing in 88% of the CDR-H2 sequences, while V H 1-69 does not have any of these motifs in its germline CDR sequences and the library design would result in each of these motifs appearing in less than 8% of the CDR-H1 and CDR-H2 sequences combined (Fig. S4). To address this issue, anchor molecules encoding these post-translational modifications were removed prior to the synthesis of CDR-H1 and CDR-H2 for each germline. This strategy significantly reduced the overall frequency of antibodies containing these motifs, while minimizing the loss of antibodies that may require these motifs in CDR-H3 for antigen specificity (Fig. 1B and 1C). \n\nThe heavy chain CDRs were assembled with undiversified framework regions that were codon optimized for both E. coli and mammalian expression 39,40 to maximize phage display levels for antibody isolation and future expression as full-length IgGs for functional testing, respectively. Roche 454 sequencing was used to assess the quality of the libraries prior to transformation into E. coli. In general, the amino acid frequencies following library synthesis correlated very well with the design, amino acid liabilities were reduced, and the desired amino acid diversity was generated (data not shown). The libraries were individually cloned based on germline and CDR-H3 length into a phagemid containing each of the three common light chains codon optimized for expression in E. coli. A total of 106 transformations were used for each heavy chain and light chain pairing, resulting in a total library of 9 \u00a3 10 11 transformants (Table S1).",

            "text": "Antibodies are Y-shaped proteins used by the immune system to identify and neutralize foreign objects like bacteria and viruses. Each antibody contains two identical sets of chains, with each set containing one heavy chain and one light chain. The variable domains of these chains control binding specificity for various antigens, containing the binding surface, known as the paratope. The paratope binds with specificity to a target antigen at its respective binding region, known as the epitope. The paratope is typically located within six Complementarity-Determining Regions (CDRs) on the antibody: three from the light chain (CDR-L1, CDR-L2, CDR-L3) and three from the heavy chain (CDR-H1, CDR-H2, CDR-H3). The Complementary-Determining Region 3 (CDR-H3) is the most diverse in terms of amino acid sequence and length-due to its lack of constraints, it is often the most complex to produce, making its generation the primary focus for modern generative models. \n\nThe end goal of machine learning is to generate antibodies in silico. In approaching this goal, the typical pipeline often includes an amino acid sequence input, sequence representation learning, structure prediction, paratope-epitope prediction, antibody-antigen docking, CDR generation, and evaluation, typically in the form of affinity prediction. The final output is a generated antibody, either in the form of a 1D sequence, 3D structure, or both. Sometimes, a 3D structure is input directly, with the sequence being predicted from the structure. Machine learning methods have been applied to various fragments of the process, with some more recent models [189], [158], [157] handling both sequence and structure generation simultaneously, and others [158] even addressing the entire endto-end process. Other subtasks like drug-applicable attribute prediction and affinity prediction have been explored using predictive AI models, but these tasks are not generative by nature and not be discussed in detail.",

One notable difference between these two antibody pairs is that the anti-IL-13 and anti-IL-4 antibodies differ in both their CDR and FR sequences (Figure S3) whereas the anti-MET and anti-EGFR antibodies have identical FR sequences (except for V H 94) and differ in their CDR sequences (Figure S2). \n\nReplacement of CDR L3 and H3 of the anti-IL-13 antibody with corresponding sequences from an anti-CD3 antibody led to substantial loss of bispecific yield of the anti-IL-13/IL-4 BsIgG 1 (~72% to 37%, Figure 4(b) and Figure S3). In contrast, a slight increase was observed when CDR L3 and H3 of the anti-IL-4 antibody were replaced in a similar manner (Figure 4(b)). These results suggest that CDR L3 and H3 of the anti-IL-13 antibody contribute to high bispecific yield of the anti-IL-13/IL-4 BsIgG 1 . \n\nAlanine-scanning mutational analysis 26 of anti-IL-13 CDR L3 and H3 was used to map residues contributing to the high bispecific yield of anti-IL-13/IL-4 BsIgG 1 . The X-ray crystallographic structure of the anti-IL-13 Fab in complex with IL-13 (PDB accession code 4I77) 27 revealed the contact residues between CDR L3 and H3 (Figure 6(a)) and was used to select residues for mutational analysis (Figure 6(b)). The CDR L3 mutation V L R96A gave the largest reduction in bispecific yield of any of the nine single alanine mutants tested for CDRs L3 and H3 and abolished the high bispecific yield (72% to 29%). As few as two alanine replacements in CDR H3, namely V H D95A:P99A, also abolished the high bispecific yield (72% to 26%).",

            "text": "Yet, we found that \"short\" CDR-L3 is remarkably rigid and retains the conformation in the interactions with antigens and neighboring CDRs. 23 In one example (3okd vs. 3okm), 24 association of Fab S25-39 with the bacterial sugar Kdo causes a dramatic induced fit of CDR-H3 and an adjustment of the VL/VH angle by 7 ; however, CDR-L3 maintains the conformation (canonical structure L3-8-NP). \n\nWe also compared different antibodies with the identical sequences in CDR-L3 and came to the same conclusion that the environment is not a major determinant of the CDR conformation. Two members of the canonical group L3-8-P7, 3iet, 25 and 3uo1, 26 have identical CDR-L3 sequences but completely different VHs. Moreover, the bound antigens are different and the side chain of the invariant Trp47 is flipped over in 3uo1. Nevertheless, CDR-L3 retains the conformation with the RMSD of 0.35 A \u02dafor all main-chain atoms of the CDR. \n\nIt is worth noting that not only the conformation of CDR-L3 is preserved in different circumstances, but also its orientation with respect to the rest of Fv. This feature of the \"short\" CDR-L3 likely stems from the fact that only four residues of the loop are outside the b-sheet structure. \n\nWhile the CDR sequence generally defines the CDR conformation, there may be other determinants, such as the underlying germline genes, that favor one canonical structure over the other. Within the reference dataset, we found no correlation between the germline and the canonical structure. Likewise, there is no clear preference of the antigen type (hapten, peptide, protein) for any particular canonical structure. Although all hapten antibodies fall into the category L3-8-NP (Table I), it should be noted that those antibodies are not completely independent and represent only two groups of related antibodies. One group was raised against chlamydial lipopolysaccharide, 13,24 and another group are catalytic antibodies induced by the hapten transition state analog.",

            "text": "The capability of B cells to defend against a wide and everevolving array of pathogens is largely attributable to the unique diversity in their immunoglobulin repertoire. An antibody molecule, either expressed as the surface B-cell receptor (BCR) or in the secreted form of a soluble antibody, is composed of two identical kappa (\u03ba) or lambda (\u03bb) immunoglobulin light chains (IgL) plus two identical immunoglobulin heavy chains (IgH; five major isotypes in humans), each containing an N-terminal variable (V \u03ba , V \u03bb or V H ) region and a C-terminal constant (C \u03ba , C \u03bb or C H ) region. Combinatorial association between the variable regions (V H :V \u03ba or V H :V \u03bb ) forms the antigen-binding site of the antibody, and its effector function is determined by the expression of a specific C H region that corresponds to the antibody isotype (or class) .\n\nDuring early ontogeny ( Fig. 1), B cells achieve combinatorial diversity through V(D)J recombination, which requires recombination activating gene (RAG) proteins to assemble a complete V \u03ba , V \u03bb or V H exon from component germline variable (V), joining (J), and diversity (D; only in V H ) gene segments. This is accompanied by imprecise insertion/deletion of N/P nucleotides at the junctions between the recombined gene segments, thus creating more genetic and protein structural variability of the variable region. These highly variable junctions, commonly termed complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), correspond to six hypervariable loops in the three-dimensional structure of an antibody that specifically interact with antigens. The third CDR of V H (CDR-H3) has the greatest diversity of the six CDRs in amino acid residues, rendering it remarkably unique to each progenitor B cell that is subsequently passed on to all of its clonally expanded progeny. Indeed, CDR-H3 is routinely used to determine clonal lineages of B cells in studies of the antibody repertoire.\n\nThe combinatorial and junctional mechanisms occur in the absence of foreign antigens",

CDR-L3 was mutagenized with oligonucleotide L3-b, which is more conservative compared with L3-a used in the first sublibrary. For the second round of affinity maturation, shotgun scanning combinatorial mutagenesis was performed to scan all residues in CDRs of GCI073 to obtain higher affinity SEB-binding Fabs by fine tuning the interaction interface. Accordingly, three sublibraries were constructed. In the first and second sublibraries, alaninescanning or homolog-scanning, respectively, was utilized to mutagenize CDRs of clone GCI073. In the third sublibrary, the oligonucleotides used for alanine scanning and homolog scanning were premixed and utilized in site-directed mutagenesis for library construction. These sublibraries were eventually pooled before they were subjected to panning.\n\nSelection and Characterization of Anti-SEB Fabs-Biopanning, direct phage ELISAs, and single-point competitive phage ELISAs were performed as described (16). A brief summary of the procedures follows. Phage particles from the libraries were cycled through rounds of binding selection with SEB coated on 96-well Maxisorp Immunoplates (Fisher) as the capture target. After five rounds of selection, phage particles were produced from individual clones grown in a 96-well format, and the culture supernatants were used in phage ELISAs to detect specific binding clones. A single-point competitive phage ELISA was used to rapidly estimate the affinities of phage-displayed anti-SEB Fabs. Clones that bound to SEB and showed \u03f350% inhibition in the presence of 10 nM solution phase SEB in single-point competitive phage ELISA were subjected to DNA sequence analysis in initial biopanning from library F.

            "text": "Antibody variable regions are composed of a heavy and a light chain, and in humans, there are two light chain isotypes: kappa and lambda. Despite their importance in receptor editing, the light chain is often overlooked in the antibody literature, with the focus being on the heavy chain complementarity-determining region (CDR)-H3 region. In this paper, we set out to investigate the physicochemical and structural differences between human kappa and lambda light chain CDR regions. We constructed a dataset containing over 29,000 light chain variable region sequences from IgM-transcribing, newly formed B cells isolated from human bone marrow and peripheral blood. We also used a published human na\u00efve dataset to investigate the CDR-H3 properties of heavy chains paired with kappa and lambda light chains and probed the Protein Data Bank to investigate the structural differences between kappa and lambda antibody CDR regions. We found that kappa and lambda light chains have very different CDR physicochemical and structural properties, whereas the heavy chains with which they are paired do not differ significantly. We also observed that the mean CDR3 N nucleotide addition in the kappa, lambda, and heavy chain gene rearrangements are correlated within donors but can differ between donors. This indicates that terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase may work with differing efficiencies between different people but the same efficiency in the different classes of immunoglobulin chain within one person. We have observed large differences in the physicochemical and structural properties of kappa and lambda light chain CDR regions. This may reflect different roles in the humoral immune response.",

            "text": "Because the parent antibody hu4D5 had high affinity (K D value of 0.54 nM, Table 2), it was difficult to identify an antibody with improved affinity using a general panning method. We were also concerned that the tight-binding \"contaminant (parent or template antibody, hu4D5)\" scFv might be dominantly selected because the parent antibody hu4D5 is an extremely tightbinding antibody. Thus, the template for each library was a modified version of phagemid, with a stop codon (TGA) introduced at an upstream or downstream position where the amino acid was to be mutated by the overlapping PCR method. A different position introducing a stop codon for each library is as follows: the S113 position of HFR4 in CDR-H3 for the LN01 and LN02 libraries and the C88 position in CDR-L3 for the LN03 library (Fig. 1). \n\nTo minimize the library size and number of constructions, we primarily excluded CDR-H1, CDR-L1, and CDR-H2, which consisted of 5, 10, 17 and 7 residues, respectively. However, the strategy for site-directed random mutagenesis of all the CDR residues, including CDR-H3 (Kabat No. #95~102, 11 amino acid residues, W 95 G 96 G 97 D 98 G 99 F 100 Y 100a A 100b M 100c D 101 Y 102 ) and CDR-L3 (Kabat No. #89~97, 9 amino acid residues, Q 89 Q 90 H 91 Y 92 T 93 T 94 P 95 P 96 T 97 ), is practically impossible because the theoretical diversity of each library is 2 x 10 14 and 5 x 10 11 , respectively, which is too large to construct the libraries. \n\nTo design a library with a suitable size for efficient screening, the CDR-L3 H91, CDR-H3 W95 and CDR-H3 Y100a positions (Gerstner et al., 2002), previously reported to be the most criti- cal to antigen binding key residues, were excluded from randomization.",

The synthetic antibody library was constructed on a single human framework as described previously (22) but with greater diversity allowed in the third hypervariable loop of the light chain. 5 The naive library pool contained \u03fe10 10 unique clones.\n\nThe library was cycled through five rounds of binding selections with immobilized SEB antigen. Enrichment was observed from the third round of biopanning. Ninety-six clones from each of rounds 3-5 were tested by single-point competition phage ELISA. Seventy-five clones showed both positive signal in spot phage ELISA and over 50% inhibition in the presence of 10 nM solution phase SEB in single-point competitive phage ELISA. These clones were sequenced, and 20 unique clones were obtained. Sequence analysis indicated that 15 of 20 clones retained the original heavy chain sequences as the template used for library construction, with the other five clones containing 1-3 point mutations in only one of the three heavy chain CDRs. The high occurrence of parental heavy chain CDRs is not due to bias introduced during the construction of the library because sequencing analysis showed that \u03f370% of the clones in the naive library are fully mutagenized in all four CDRs subjected to mutagenesis, meaning that only 30% of clones contain one or several loop sequences, as found in the parental clone. 5 This correlates well with the typical \u03fe80% mutagenesis efficiencies obtained with the mutagenesis procedure used to introduce diversity (23). Moreover, Fab clones containing highly diversified sequences in four CDRs, although displaying high antigen-binding affinity and specificity, were also obtained from the selection using this naive library against different antigens. 6 In contrast, all SEB-binding clones had CDR-L3 sequences different from that in the template, of which 16 clones share the following consensus CDR-L3 sequence: (S/V/A)(Y/W)S(A/S)(S/H/Y/V)(S/Y/H)PF. Therefore, our affinity maturation strategy for further improvement was focused on the consensus sequence of CDR-L3.\n\nFirst Affinity Maturation-Two sublibrar",

            "text": "Phage display has become the most frequently used display technology, with the advantage of robustness due to high stability of the phage (Hoet et al., 2005). The in vitro methods employ a na\u00efve antibody library generated from donor-derived B cells, a synthetic library from synthetically derived diversity, or a semi-synthetic library derived from a combination of these two approaches, which differ in framework region (FR) composition and CDR diversification (Glanville et al., 2009;Hoogenboom, 2005;Kugler et al., 2015;Lloyd et al., 2009;Tiller et al., 2013;Zhai et al., 2011). The most commonly used antibody formats for phage display are single-chain Fv (scFv) and Fab. ScFv fragments are moderately stable on average and often have a high tendency to form multimers as well as aggregates, whereas Fab fragments have been found to possess comparably higher structural stability by an additional interface of the constant domains (Rothlisberger et al., 2005). For these reasons, Fab has replaced the scFv as a display format in many of recent phage libraries (Ponsel et al., 2011). \n\nIn this study, we constructed a large na\u00efve human Fab library (3 \uf0b4 10 10 colonies) from the peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs), lymph node, spleen, and bone marrow of 809 human donors and assessed available diversities of the VH and \u03ba VL (VK) repertoires in the entire library by 454 pyrosequencing. In addition, we validated the antibody library by selecting specific Fabs against 10 different therapeutically relevant antigens by phage display. The antibody library will be useful in the generation of human mAbs against diverse antigens, and the information about the diversity of natural antibody repertoires will be valuable in the future design of synthetic human antibody libraries with high functional diversity.",

            "text": "In this report, we attempted to alleviate the problem of amplification bias by designing an antibody library consisting of clones with a better amplification profile and that are thus less likely to be outcompeted by non-binders during the amplification phase of biopanning (Figure 1). Using a previously constructed library with low, non-combinatorial complementarity-determining region (CDR) diversities (OPAL-S) [3], single-chain variable fragment (scFv) clones that were amplified and/or displayed more efficiently were enriched by panning against protein A from Staphylocucccus aureus. Protein A is primarily known for its binding activity to the Fc portion of immunoglobulins [19], but it also binds to variable domains belonging to human VH3 subgroup [20]; this unique characteristic has been utilized to select well-folded and highly displayed antibody fragments from phage libraries [10,21,22]. The effect of CDR sequences on the panning enrichment of antibody clones was evaluated by comparing the next generation sequencing (NGS) repertoires of the library before and after panning. CDR sequences for the new library were designed based on the NGS analysis and, especially for CDR-H3, machine learning (ML) models were trained from the sequencing data and utilized to predict fast-amplified sequences. The new library, OPAL-T, generally performed better than OPAL-S when tested against a panel of antigens, highlighting the effectiveness of the antibody library design strategy focused on amplification efficiency. The enrichment pattern of CDR sequences was applied to the design of OPAL-T. For CDR-H3 especially, ML models were trained on the NGS data and utilized for the design of improved CDR-H3 diversity.",

            "text": "Even though Y103 and D107 of the CDR-H3 loop can still form an interaction with Y32 of the CDR-L1 loop, the key interaction partner N34 at the end of the CDR-L1 loop is missing, which might contribute for the decrease in stability (SI Table S4). Also, instead of smaller residues in the center of the CDR-L3 loop, we find bulky residues, which might be less beneficial for the interplay with the CDR-H3 loop. Thus, interactions with the V L -CDR loops can influence the sidechain flexibility of the CDR-H3 loop and help to elucidate structural determinants for differences in stability. \n\nApart from the interdomain interactions of the CDR loops that substantially influence the V H -V L interface, also certain framework residues have been discussed to have an effect on the paratope (24,26,33,71,72,(74)(75)(76)(77). Various studies have already investigated the role of framework mutations on the CDR loops and the relative V H -V L interdomain orientations based on X-ray structures (68,78,79). Even allosteric effects involving mutations in the C H 1-C L and the elbow angle have been reported to impact the antibody binding site and consequentially affinity and specificity (24,26,33,71,72,(74)(75)(76)(77). In particular, residue 71 H [Kabat nomenclature (80)], has been shown to co-determine the canonical conformation of the CDR-H2 loop, according to whether there is a bulky residue or a small side-chain present and thus bringing the CDR-H1 and CDR-H2 loops closer to each other (27,30,81). Especially interesting is that the 71 H residue is part of the Vernier-zone residues, which have been reported to play a critical role in the humanization process and for rational design of antibodies in general as they can influence antibody specificity and affinity (73,79,82,83).",

            "text": "This procedure yielded a calculated library size of approximately 5 \u00d7 10 7 independent clones. Since it is believed that the major function of the light chain is in stabilizing the paratope (12), we decided to display this diversity with a single light chain (V30) that was deduced from pdb entries: 4K3E ( 21), 5E99, 5IHU, 5IJV, 5ILT (13), 6E9G, 6E9H, 6E9I, 6E9K, 6E9Q, and 6E9U (15), which share a CDR-identical light chain. This variable domain (Supplementary Figure S2B) was incorporated into a linearized light chain plasmid (pLC) by gap repair cloning and consequently fused to human CLl exploiting BJ5464 cells (haploid, mating type a, MATa). Subsequently, yeast mating was applied to establish the chimeric Fab library (29), resulting in adequate oversampling of the estimated heavy chain diversity (about 3 \u00d7 10 9 unique clones). To assess the functionality and quality of the generated library, 96 clones were sent out for sequencing. This revealed a high functionality of ultralong CDR-H3 sequences of 79.2% (76/96 single clones), with 3.1% (3/96 clones) sequences having a CDR-H3 region of <40 amino acids and 12.5% (12/96 sequences) frame-shifted sequences and 5.2% ambiguous results (5/96). Afterwards, this library was subjected to fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) using a target concentration of 1 \u00b5M rh EGFR (ECD). As shown in Figure 2A, within two rounds of selection, we were able to enrich for an antigen-binding population. Sequencing revealed 15 unique ultralong CDR-H3 regions ranging from 59 to 65 residues (Figure 2B). Based on sequence similarity of the knob region, those were clustered into eight clonotypes. Interestingly, the CDRs only harbored an even number of four to eight Cys residues, presumably forming disulfide bonds, a hallmark of ultralong CDR-H3-derived knob structures.",

            "text": "The IgG molecule is composed of two Fabs that recognize the epitope and a crystallizable fragment (Fc) region that interacts with receptors on the cell surface (Figure 1a). In the Fab region, two main points of contact mediate the HC/LC interaction: the VH/VL and CH1/CL domains. Although antibodies mostly conserve the CH1/CL interface (with only the LC kappa/lambda diversity to account for), the VH-VL interface is highly variable and unique to each antibody. Indeed, here both framework and CDRs directly engage across the interface (Figure 1a). To further evaluate the native properties of the VH/VL interface, we sought to analyze six x-ray structures of mAbs generated against a variety of relevant therapeutic targets. Across these six structures, we calculated that ~100 (94 to 112) residues mediate the HC/LC interface (buried surface area of 1,620-1,880 \u00c5 2 ), with over 40% of those located in the VH/ VL interface, with the CDRs contributing ~20% of the total (Figure 1b). Surprisingly, among all six CDRs, the CDR-H2 and CDR-H3 in the HC and CDR-L3 in the LC have the most interfacing residues and are responsible for over 15% of the overall HC/LC interaction. Since CDR-H3 and CDR-L3 are major determinants for antibody target specificity, they are highly variable, displaying low sequence identity (11.1 and 23.3%, respectively (Figure 1c)). Due to the fact that highly diverse CDRs can contribute to HC/LC interaction, we hypothesized that some HC/LC pairs and interfaces may be more favorable than others. Moreover, as the VH/VL interaction is reportedly the first step during the assembly of the quaternary IgG structure, 22,23 a favorable VH/VL pair may be key to prime the cognate HC/LC pairing.",

            "text": ", are complicated by the requirement of donor immunization, the requirement of a high dose, and batch to batch variation. Human or humanized monoclonal antibodies represent a safe and effective alternative to the traditional polyclonal approaches.\n\nIn this study, we used a methodical approach using screening of a fully synthetic phage display library of human antibodies to identify highly effective neutralizing antibodies against SEB. The lead antibodies were shown to be effective in a postexposure setting against TSS in mice. Furthermore, we have demonstrated the feasibility of production of such antibodies using a novel plant expression system at low costs and high yields, an attribute critically important for a biodefense countermeasure.\n\nBy using the highly diverse phage-displayed synthetic antibody library F, 5 we identified a group of Fabs that target SEB with high affinity. Competitive phage ELISA indicated that these antibodies recognized the same epitope on SEB (data not shown). It is not surprising because, except for CDR-L3, 15 of the 20 antibodies share the same CDR sequences in the heavy and light chains as those in the template used for library construction, with the remaining containing only 1-3 mutations in CDR-H1 or CDR-H2 (Table 1). Moreover, the CDR-L3 sequences of these antibodies share significant homology. This indicates that, unlike the traditional view of heavy chain CDRs as major contributors in antigen recognition (27)(28)(29)(30)(31) for this group of antibodies, CDR-L3 plays the dominant role in SEB binding. Therefore, the strategy for first round affinity maturation was focused on CDR-L3. By carefully controlling selection conditions, this round of affinity maturation resulted in antibodies with single-digit nanomolar binding affinity, a modest improvement compared with their parental counterparts. In order to further improve antibody affinity, alanine-scanning and homolog-scanning strategies were applied to one of the four best neutralizing antibodies identified in the first round of affinity maturation. Alanine-scanning and homolog-scanning combinatorial mutagenesis are commonly used to determine the functional contributions of individual side chains involved in protein-protein interactions, especially in case where the high resolution structure of the complex is not available (32).",

            "text": "It is only at this point that the L chain can attempt to engender the diversity created early in B cell development in the H chain by combinatorial and junctional diversification mechanisms. This incredible and almost astronomic potential for diversity has led to a common perception that the immunoglobulin (Ig) repertoire can be treated as random in its composition [3,4]. \n\nDiversity in the H chain and L chain repertoires is asymmetrically distributed. Each chain contains four sequence intervals of relatively conserved sequence, termed framework regions that are separated by four more diverse intervals, termed complementarity determining regions, or CDRs. These CDRs are juxtaposed to form the antigen binding site, as classically defined. CDRs 1 and 2 form the outside of the antigen binding site, and CDR3 of the L chain forms the base. The third CDR of the H chain, CDR-H3, lies as the center of the antigen binding site where it often plays a key role in defining the binding activity of the antibody. Of these six CDRs, CDR-H3 is the most variable because it contains the termini of the V and J gene segments, the D gene segment in its entirely, and the effects of terminal nibbling, P junctions and N addition. As a result of its diversity and its central position, CDR-H3 often plays a critical role in defining the specificity and affinity of its antibody. \n\nEach B cell, as it develops encounters self or non-self-antigens as it passes through a sequential series of quality control checkpoints. The assumption of a random repertoire is often coupled to the view that the repertoire is shaped primarily by the individual reactivity of immunoglobulin towards these antigens. Central checkpoints occur in the fetal liver and in the bone marrow as developing B cells build their immunoglobulins, and peripheral checkpoints are found in the spleen and other lymphoid organs as more mature B cells circulate through the body [5]. \n\nClose inspection of the amino acid composition of the developing CDR-H3 repertoire has led to a different view of the forces shaping the B cell repertoire in normal development and disease.",

            "text": "Immunoglobulin repertoires are very plastic and B cells populations constantly evolve in response to different pathogens and other stimuli. In addition, the sequences encoding immunoglobulins that recombine during B cell development to generate functional antibodies differ between species. Several studies have shown that CDR sequences of non-human origin can be used to generate humanized antibodies [36], [37], [38]. The aim of our study was to isolate and capture the features of immunoglobulin repertoires from different species or from B cell populations that have been biased in response to antigens and incorporate these features into human antibody libraries. We developed a generic approach to retrieve CDRH3 sequences from different sources and clone them into selected human antibody frameworks using type IIS restriction cloning that avoids modification of the antibody coding sequence either in the CDRs or in the antibody framework regions. Although applicable to any CDR, we focused on the CDR3 of the heavy chain as it is the most diversified region of an antibody and in many cases contributes to most of the antigen binding energy [28], [29]. \n\nFive phage antibody libraries were constructed by capturing CDRH3 sequences from human healthy donors or mice that were either naive or immunized with different antigens. We then analyzed these libraries by NGS which is a powerful method to extensively characterize such large repertoires [33], [35]. The analysis showed that the new libraries contained CDRH3 having length and amino acid compositions typical of murine or human CDRH3 sequences, demonstrating that CDR capture enables the generation of human antibody libraries that probe three dimensional space differently. This might allow taking advantage of long CDR loops found in camelid VHH or shark V-NAR domains that are much better suited to target cavities such as enzyme active sites or difficult to access epitopes in canyons of viruses [39], [40]. Furthermore, by cloning CDR sequences into selected frameworks, the probability of generating a functional antibody in the new context is higher compared to the use of synthetically diversified CDRs that frequently lead to non-functional antibodies that cannot fold properly.",

            "text": "4.1. Structural basis of antibody mediated antigen recognition, specificity, and cross-reactivity \n\nAntibodies are soluble forms of the membrane anchored B cell antigen receptor (BCR). Each na\u00efve B cell bears a unique BCR and ligand (antigen) -binding capacity, which can be clonally selected by the cognate antigen, resulting in antibody secretion by alternative splicing of the BCR transcript. Antigen specificity and cross-reactivity depend on antigen binding site (paratope) structure. The paratope is composed by three hypervariable loops called Complementarity Determining Regions (CDR-H1, -H2, and -H3) of the Heavy and 3 CDR's of the Light chain, at the Variable region of both chains. CDR1 and 2 have limited variability because they are encoded in germline V segments, while the CDR3 structure is highly variable because it is determined by V(D)J recombination (Davis and Bjorkman, 1988;Schroeder and Cavacini, 2010). \n\nAll known CDR1, 2 and CDR-L3 adopt a limited number of standard canonical structures (Chothia and Lesk, 1987;Lara-Ochoa et al., 1996). Only the CDR-H3 loop, is highly diverse and does not adopt a canonical structure. Current evidence suggests that all CDR's, except CDR-H3, are rather cross-reactive structures that contribute to stabilize the antigen-paratope interaction, and the major determinant for the affinity is the CDR-H3 (Davis, 2004). Under this model, an epitope will be cross-reactive if critical residues that bind to the CDR-H3 are conserved in a variant epitope, despite little or non-conservation of contact residues of the remaining CDR's. Conversely, variant-specific epitope recognition will occur if the variant epitope has mutated in critical residues that bind to the CDR-H3, despite conservation of the remaining CDR contacts.",

            "text": "Antibodies recognize and bind an extremely large repertoire of antigens via six hypervariable loop regions (H1, H2, H3, L1, L2, L3) in their variable domain (F v ) known as the complementarity determining regions (CDRs). The CDRs leverage a vast sequence space to target the immensely diverse range of antigens that challenge the immune system. CDR diversity results from V(D)J gene recombination prior to antigen exposure followed by somatic hypermutation after antigen exposure (1). Hence, antibodies achieve the ability to target a diverse range of epitopes by both diversifying the CDR sequences prior to antigen exposure and by antigen-specific hypermutation post antigenic exposure. The process of evolution of an antibody to bind an antigen with higher affinity and specificity is known as affinity maturation.\n\nIn the laboratory, affinity maturation is achieved broadly in two steps. First, large libraries of CDR regions are diversified via methods such as random mutagenesis, targeted mutagenesis, and chain shuffling. Second, the libraries are screened for expression and binding through display technologies such as yeast or phage display. These steps are repeated until enough \"hits\" are found with the desired affinity. Such approaches to affinity maturation can be expensive and time-consuming, and rarely allow the efficient exploration of the full design space (2). Computational methods offer faster and inexpensive alternatives to experimental affinity maturation. Conventional computational approaches for antibody design or affinity maturation include rational or structure-guided design strategies (3,4), general protein design methods such as FastDesign (5), and antibody-specific design methods such as AbDesign (6) and RosettaAntibodyDesign (7) (RAbD). RAbD is notable because it allows the design of CDR sequences and conformations in the context of the antigen. However, RAbD requires 10-20 hours for a single design. Further, RAbD only samples CDR sequences from PyIgClassify (8) clusters that have arbitrary classification cutoffs and are context (surrounding residues) agnostic. Further, Rosetta (like other methods) has challenges in accurate modeling of CDR H3 (9).\n\nDeep learning (DL) models are transforming the field",

            "text": "We ranked round 3 CDRH3 sequences based on their relative frequencies. Nineteen sequences were present above 0.1%, and all of them had the above-mentioned CDRH3 lengths. While 15 out of 19 sequences had short CDRH3 lengths (Figure 2D), each of the other four CDRH3 lengths had one sequence above 0.1% (Figure 2E). The longest CDRH3 was 19 residues and was the anti-maltose binding protein (MBP) CDRH3 sequence used in template phagemid for library F construction (Persson et al., 2013). We analyzed the frequency of the most abundant Fabs from six selected lengths over five rounds of selection (Figure 2F). The three short CDRH3 sequences showed a significant enrichment throughout the selection process. The three larger CDRH3 sequences showed a lower enrichment in round 3, and their frequency decreased in later rounds. \n\nRandom clone picking and Sanger sequencing of 20 clones from rounds 3 and 4 phage pools only recovered the three mostfrequent clones with short CDRH3 lengths (referred as highfrequency clones). Therefore, we used our NGS-assisted Fab reconstruction method to recover the three less-frequent clones with longer CDRH3 lengths (referred as low-frequency clones). To identify the diversified CDR sequences (L3, H1, and H2) that paired with the CDRH3 sequences of interest, we removed the intervening sequence between the CDRs using our CDR strip methodology (Barreto et al., 2019). This generated a PCR amplicon of ~200 bp that contained CDRs L3-H1-H2-H3 closer in linear sequence space. We used this strategy to sequence a CDR strip from round 3 on a 400-bp chip. As the maximum read length offered by Ion Torrent was 400 bases, the framework deletion step was necessary to reduce the amplicon length from 1,100 bases to 200 bases. Once CDR-combinations were identified, we reconstructed desired Fab clones by cloning CDR-encoding oligonucleotides into the MBP template phagemid (Persson et al., 2013) by Kunkel mutagenesis (Kunkel et al., 1987).",

Alanine-scanning mutagenesis 26 of anti-MET CDR L3 and H3 was used to map residues contributing to the high bispecific yield of anti-EGFR/MET BsIgG 1 (Figure 5(b)). The V L Y91A mutation in CDR L3 gave the largest reduction in bispecific yield (84% to 57%) of any of the 12 single alanine mutants tested. As few as two alanine replacements in CDR L3, namely V L Y91A:Y94A, abolished the high bispecific yield (84% to 23%). Thus, CDR L3 residues V L Y91 and Y94 appear to make critical contributions to high bispecific yield for the anti-EGFR/MET BsIgG 1 . The expression titers of all the mutants were comparable to the parent BsIgG 1 as estimated by the recovered yield from protein A chromatography (data not shown). \n\nCDR L3 and H3 of anti-IL-13 antibody contribute to high bispecific yield for anti-IL-13/IL-4 BsIgG 1 Specific residues in CDR L3 of the anti-MET antibody are important for high bispecific yield for the anti-EGFR/MET BsIgG 1 (see above). We postulated that similar principles may apply to the anti-IL-13 antibody in contributing to high bispecific yield of the anti-IL-13/IL-4 BsIgG 1 . An analogous experimental strategy was used to investigate this possibility.",

Five of six antibody CDR loops presumably adopt a so-called canonical structure out of a limited number of conformations. However, here we show for four antibody CDR-L3 loops differing in length and sequence, that each loop undergoes conformational transitions between different canonical structures. By extensive sampling in combination with Markov-state models we reconstruct the kinetics and probabilities of the transitions between canonical structures. Additionally, for these four CDR-L3 loops, we identify all relevant conformations in solution. Thereby we extend the model of static canonical structures to a dynamic conformational ensemble as a new paradigm in the field of antibody structure design.",

As expected, the IGHV14-1 CDR sequence profiles of m3 derived from NGS were identical to the S316 antibody CDR sequence profiles from m3 (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Figure S3a), indicating that the IGHV14-1 antibodies in m3 were expanded clones in responding to the immunization. Similarly, the IGHV1-47 CDR sequence profiles of m4 and m6 derived from NGS resemble to those of the S316 antibodies from m4 and m6 (Supplementary Figure S3b), suggesting that IGHV1-47 germline gene was predominantly selected to respond to the antigen in m4 and m6. Both families of IGHV14-1 and IGHV1-47-related clones were not found in NGS antibody sequences from na\u00efve mouse m0 (Supplementary Figure S3); the differences were particularly evident in the CDR-H3 region, suggesting that the clonal expansion of the IGHV14-1 and IGHV1-47 related antibodies was induced by the immunization. By contrast, comparisons of the light chain variable CDR sequence profiles derived from the NGS of the control and immunized mice with those of S316 antibodies revealed no substantial difference, indicating that light chain variable domains were not particularly selective in responding to immunization-induced clonal expansion. Together, the common theme emerging from the antibodies elicited in the immunized mice was that the expanded clones mostly had the same CS combination -1-2-2-1-1 for CDR H1-H2-L1-L2-L3, although the germline gene usage could be different and the path of affinity maturation could be diverse in the antibody responses. \n\nAn artificial antibody library mimicking the predominant structural subgroup of the mouse antibody repertoires was constructed with three key principles.",

The Fv portions, which are comprised of VL and VH (sequences shown in Figure S3), were shown to be similar with most of the minor variations occurring in the CDR loops surrounding the binding site (Figure 3C). End-on surface views of each Fab illustrate that the main difference between Fab1 (Figure 3A) and Fab2 (Figure 3B) occurs in CDR H3. This is further evident in the CDR view of each Fab. In the overlay, there is little to no variation in L1, L2, L3 and H1 CDR loops, but some variation in H2 and larger differences in H3, which can be seen in the mainchain as well as some individual side-chains (Figure 3D-F).

We believe several factors may contribute to the inverse association observed between H3 length and affinity and the high importance of this feature: 1) antibodies with unusually long H3s often target heavily glycosylated epitopes (e.g., HIV env), as the long H3 is selected to accomodate glycans and glycanengaging antibodies in our dataset tend to have lower affinity (Figure 1B); 2) there appears to be a tradeoff between H3 length and the number of CDRs that interact with the antigen, where the number of CDRs interacting with the antigen is correlated with higher affinity 3) there may be an elevated entropic cost associated with binding for longer H3s. We note that it is non-trivial to deconvolute the various causal vs. correlative contributions of these factors and others to the H3 length-affinity relationship, but highlight this relationship as a potentially fruitful avenue for future work. \n\nSecond, although H3 features are generally and broadly enriched, the most important features describing the quantity or quality of a given CDR interaction occur for the light chain. The top-ranking features that count aromatic and charged interactions do so for the CDR-L2 and -L3 rather than for H3. Moreover, the top statistical (AIF) and machine-learned (dMaSIF) features describing the quality of a specific CDR interaction also select light chain CDRs rather than H3. These findings support a conclusion that significant and high-quality contact for multiple light chain CDRs is more important for very high affinity interactions than a highly-optimized H3 interaction in isolation. Importantly, however, we note that the existence of numerous high-affinity nanobodies establish that light chaininteractions are not strictly required for very high affinity. \n\nThird, the simple feature-sets we compute directly from the structural complexes perform nearly as well for classification as the complex network, statistical, and machine-learned feature-sets. This finding has several implications. Most importantly, for future work featurizing antibody-antigen interactions, simple features such as the top-performing aa_counts_CDR can be computed quickly and efficiently with minor performance loss.",

FabM GUG is a chimer of mouse constant domains and human variable domains (IGKV3-20 and IGHV3-23), with a display improving mutation M GUG , which changed the start codon of the PelB signal sequence of the PelB-VH-CH1 chain from ATG to GTG. The VL and VH variants for the Fab libraries originated from the beta-lactamasepurified light (LC-BLA) and heavy chain repertoires (Fd-BLA) as described for ScFvM construction [14]. In the antibody library, two, six, two and four positions were randomized in the CDR-L1, CDR-L3, CDR-H1 and CDR-H2 loops, respectively, with the majority of diversity introduced at the CDR-H3 loop containing variating loop lengths from 5 to 12 residues (IMGT definition). Same amount of randomized SfiI-digested Fab gene cassette was inserted into the phagemids pEB30, pEB32x and pEB92 containing the full-length p3, truncated p3 (p3\u0394) and p9 genes, respectively. The ScFv repertoire was identical to the ScFvM library described in Huovinen et al. [14]. The display constructions and expected phenotypes on phage are depicted in Figure 1. The detailed linker sequence between the antibody fragment and the capsid protein was AASGA-EKDIR in full-length p3 display, AASGA-EKIEGR in p3\u0394 display and AASGA-myc-GGSGG in p9 display. AASGA (or ASGA in ScFv construct) is extra sequence due to the integrated SfiI site and EKDIR and EKIEGR were added for promoting trypsin elution. Also the myc-tag contains a lysine, which sensitizes the p9-Fab construction to trypsin cleavage at this region.\n\nColony counts of the transformed libraries varied from 1\u00d710 9 to 6\u00d710",

Close to one million reads were obtained. \n\nUsing this rich source of information, we first conducted a comparative study of the three samples in terms of IGHV/ KV and IGHJ/KJ germline genes usage, CDR-H3 and CDR-L3 length distribution, and amino acid composition of the predominant CDR-H3 and CDR-L3 loop lengths. Consistent with previous reports, 14,15 we found that the rabbit VH repertoire is dominated by one or two IGHV genes recombined with one or two IGHJ genes. The VL repertoire is more diverse, with nine genes contributing to the na\u00efve repertoire and the immune response elicited in response to the peptide immunization. Also consistent with previous reports, we found that the CDR-H3 and CDR-L3 lengths followed a normal distribution with average lengths of 12 and 11 residues, respectively. The amino acid composition was found to be rich in Tyr, Gly and Ser, similar to its human counterpart. \n\nWe then analyzed in detail the number of putative somatic mutations in VH and VL. Rabbit V regions seem to accumulate two-third more mutations than humans and mice, perhaps as a mechanism to diversify the repertoire of antibodies generated by a limited number of germline genes. We also mapped the positions prone to mutations and those conserved along the V regions. In VH, the mutational activity revolved around the CDRs. In VL, the pattern is fuzzier, with high mutational activity in FR-1 and several positions of FR-3. Together with the gene usage and the CDR-H3/L3 analyses, this information provides a reference for studies aiming to understand the origin and nature of the diversity of rabbit antibodies.

            "text": "Sequence and structural diversity in immunoglobulin variable regions enable antibodies to bind a virtually unlimited number of antigenic structures. Sequence diversity is generated somatically during the process of B cell maturation by recombination of germline-encoded heavy and light chain germline gene segments into full-length functional variable region exons. 1 Light chain variable region sequence diversity is generated by recombination of V L and J L gene germline segments along with relatively limited junctional diversity generated by nucleotide nibbling and incorporation between these segments. By contrast, heavy chain variable region sequence diversity is generated by recombination of three germline segments, V H , D H and J H , which, along with significant nucleotide nibbling and incorporation, generates high sequence and length diversity in the third complementaritydetermining region of the heavy chain (CDR H3). 2,3 The CDR H3 region is located centrally in the interface between antibody and antigen and usually provides critical contacts with the antigen. The CDR H3 region is considered to be a major determinant of antibody specificity due to its high sequence diversity and central role in antigen binding. 1,4 mmune repertoires, while highly diverse, have a significant degree of redundancy in specificities. This redundancy is mostly due to expansion of B cell clones harboring antigen-specific B cell receptors. 5 Somatic mutation and clonal selection results in antibody clones with differing affinities for antigen and sometimes differing fine specificity for homologous antigens. However, these clonally related antibodies have essentially the same binding mode, defined as overall occluded antigen surface and binding geometry. 7][8][9] Sequence features that are conserved in convergent antibodies vary and include shared V H and/or V L chain germline segment use, CDR H3 sequences or a combination of these. 1][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24] Antibody convergence is now a major principle behind rational human immunodeficiency virus type 1 vaccine design. 25",

            "text": "ABSTRACT Antibodies have increasingly been developed as drugs with over 100 now licensed in the US or EU. During development, it is often necessary to increase or reduce the affinity of an antibody and rational attempts to do so rely on having a structure of the antibody-antigen complex often obtained by modeling. The antigen-binding site consists primarily of six loops known as complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), and an open question has been whether these loops change their conformation when they bind to an antigen. Existing surveys of antibody-antigen complex structures have only examined CDR conformational change in case studies or small-scale surveys. With an increasing number of antibodies where both free and complexed structures have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank, a large-scale survey of CDR conformational change during binding is now possible. To this end, we built a dataset, AbAgDb, that currently includes 177 antibodies with high-quality CDRs, each of which has at least one bound and one unbound structure. We analyzed the conformational change of the C\u03b1 backbone of each CDR upon binding and found that, in most cases, the CDRs (other than CDR-H3) show minimal movement, while 70.6% and 87% of CDR-H3s showed global C\u03b1 RMSD\u2009\u2264\u20091.0\u00c5 and\u2009\u2264\u20092.0\u00c5, respectively. We also compared bound CDR conformations with the conformational space of unbound CDRs and found most of the bound conformations are included in the unbound conformational space. In future, our results will contribute to developing insights into antibodies and new methods for modeling and docking.",

            "text": "High-affinity antibodies are widely used in diagnostics and for the treatment of human diseases. However, most antibodies are isolated from semi-synthetic libraries by phage display and do not possess in vivo affinity maturation, which is triggered by antigen immunization. It is therefore necessary to engineer the affinity of these antibodies by way of in vitro assaying. In this study, we optimized the affinity of two human monoclonal antibodies which were isolated by phage display in a previous related study. For the 42A1 antibody, which targets the liver cancer antigen glypican-3, the variant T57H in the second complementarity-determining region of the heavy chain (CDR-H2) exhibited a 2.6-fold improvement in affinity, as well as enhanced cell-binding activity. For the I4A3 antibody to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, beneficial single mutations in CDR-H2 and CDR-H3 were randomly combined to select the best synergistic mutations. Among these, the mutation S53P-S98T improved binding affinity (about 3.7 fold) and the neutralizing activity (about 12 fold) compared to the parent antibody. Taken together, single mutations of key residues in antibody CDRs were enough to increase binding affinity with improved antibody functions. The mutagenic combination of key residues in different CDRs creates additive enhancements. Therefore, this study provides a safe and effective in vitro strategy for optimizing antibody affinity.",

            "text": "Furthermore, by cloning CDR sequences into selected frameworks, the probability of generating a functional antibody in the new context is higher compared to the use of synthetically diversified CDRs that frequently lead to non-functional antibodies that cannot fold properly. In this way, the benefit of using stable frameworks and CDR sequences that have been proofread in another repertoire can be combined for improved library functionality. \n\nIt has been demonstrated that even small antibody libraries constructed by combinatorial assembly of heavy and light chain variable regions derived from immunized animals facilitate the isolation of specific antibodies against the antigen used as immunogen [8], [20]. This is explained by the fact that recombining a VH and VL repertoire enriched for antigen specific sequences leads to more frequent productive combinations in the library and, thus, increased hit rates and binding affinities. In contrast, naive repertoires based on assembly of variable genes from naive sources, need to be of a much larger size (.10 9 ) in order to have reasonable chances of success [41]. \n\nWe reasoned that by capturing the central element of diversity of a biased antibody repertoire and grafting it into a novel antibody library, we could transfer its target specificity. This hypothesis was demonstrated using two independent sources of biased CDRH3 sequences. First, three libraries incorporating CDRH3 isolated from naive or immunized mice were used for phage display selections. These libraries had identical characteristics in terms of variable gene family content but led to significantly different performances both in term of hit rate and target binding capacity of the purified antibody fragments. This first approach demonstrated that for two model antigens, hIFNc and hIL6 receptor, the target specificity of an in vivo biased repertoire could be transferred via its CDRH3 content. \n\nWe extended and confirmed these finding by using as a source of CDRH3 sequences, the output of a third round of phage selection against hIFNc. Despite its smaller size, the biased library more frequently generated clones having higher binding capacity against hIFNc compared to a larger naive library. Libraries especially designed to address a certain class of antigen have been difficult to generate and only few examples have reported for instance against haptens [42]. Clones were then ranked according to their level of absorbance at 450 nm.",

            "text": "Antibody molecules bind antigens with high affinity and specificity by synergistically using multiple noncovalent forces. The combining site (paratope), whose shape is complementary to the epitope on the antigen, is made up of the hypervariable regions, also called complementarity determining regions (CDRs) 1  (1). It is commonly accepted that there are three CDRs in the light chain (L1, L2, and L3) and in the heavy chain (H1, H2, and H3). These CDRs fold into turn structures that are stabilized by the \u2424-sheet framework of the variable domains. The interface between antibodies and antigens has been precisely described by x-ray crystallographic studies, and several complexes between Fab fragments of monoclonal antibodies and peptide or protein antigens have been recently described (for reviews see Refs. [2][3][4]. The structures of antibody-antigen complexes indicate that at least four of the CDRs, and in some cases all six CDRs, contribute to antigen binding (5). Residues in the framework have rarely been reported to participate in this interaction (6,7). \n\nAntibody-peptide or antibody-protein complexes are excellent model systems to study the physicochemical requirements for molecular recognition. Unfortunately, it is a difficult task to obtain crystals suitable for the structural elucidation of antibody fragments in complex with proteins or peptides. Therefore, other approaches to obtain information about the key residues involved in the interaction would be very useful, in particular for paratope mutagenesis. Some workers have demonstrated that synthetic peptides derived from the amino acid sequences of CDRs bind antigens with specificities similar to those of the original antibody molecules (8 -15). Such peptides have very often been chosen in the CDR3 of the V H sequence, which is considered to play a prominent role in defining antibody reactivity. However, the capacity of synthetic peptides derived from the variable regions of a given antibody to bind an antigen has never been probed in a systematic manner, i.e. in assessing the antigen binding capacity of every overlapping peptide from the V H and V L sequences.",

            "text": "However, the common light chain library design limits the majority of CDR-H3 sequences to pair with a single CDR-H1 and CDR-H2 combination. To identify a more optimal pairing, the CDR-H3 sequences obtained following the 4th round of panning against 4-1BB were recombined with the original library of CDR-H1 and CDR-H2 48 in a process called H3-shuffling. Germline-specific primers were used to recover the CDR-H3 sequences while maintaining the V H and V L germline pairings of each clone. Library generation was readily accomplished due to the modular nature of the original library design, which incorporated unique germline-specific restriction sites in framework 3 of the heavy chains and a generic restriction site in framework 4 of the heavy chain while minimizing their occurrences in the diversified CDRs (Fig. 3A). This maintains the CDR-H3 and V H germline pairing and prevents the introduction of non-human sequences in framework 3, which could arise through a PCR-based assembly. Instead of returning to the polyvalent scFv phagemid used to maximize the chance of antibody recovery from the original library, a primarily monovalent Fab display phagemid was used to increase the probability of identifying high affinity clones. 51 he resulting shuffled library contained 3 \u00a3 10 10 transformants and was subjected to 1 round of plate panning, then 3 rounds of solution panning as described above. \n\nFollowing the 4th and final round of panning, 1536 clones were sequenced and their binding toward 4-1BB, a tag control, insulin, and ssDNA were determined using the same automated phage ELISA described above. The total number of unique antigen-specific antibodies based on the V H sequence increased from 750 (49% total) for the original library to 1180 (77% total) for the shuffled library (Table 1). However, only a small fraction of these shuffled library antibodies (135, 11%) had unique CDR-H3 sequences, while the majority (748, 99.7%) from the original library were unique.",

B-cells contribute to immune defense by expressing receptors, called antibodies, that bind specifically to foreign antigens. The astonishing capability of antibodies to recognize virtually any foreign molecule has also been exploited by scientists for a wide variety of applications, and antibodies now play central roles in a variety of experimental techniques (immunofluorescence, western blots, ChIP-Seq, etc.). Antibody-based therapeutic drugs have also been developed for treating a wide variety of diseases [1]. \n\nMuch is known about the qualitative mechanisms of antibody generation and function [2]. The antigenic specificity of antibodies in humans, mice, and most jawed vertebrates is primarily governed by six complementarity determining regions (CDRs), each roughly 10 amino acids long. Three CDRs (denoted CDR1H, CDR2H, and CDR3H) are located on the antibody heavy chain, and three are on the light chain. During B-cell differentiation, these six sequences are randomized through V(D)J recombination, then selected for functionality and for the ability to avoid recognizing host antigens. Upon participation in an immune response, CDR regions can further undergo somatic hypermutation and selection, yielding higher-affinity antibodies for specific antigens. \n\nMany high-throughput techniques for assaying and selecting antibodies are currently available. Many methods, including phage display [3][4][5] and yeast display [6,7] technologies, have been developed for artificially selecting and optimizing antibodies in vitro. More recently, advances in DNA sequencing technology have made it possible to effectively monitor antibody and T-cell receptor diversity within immune repertoires, e.g. in healthy individuals [8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15], in specific tissues [16], in individuals with diseases [17] or following vaccination [18][19][20][21].",

An essential question to answer is what parameters we can control to finely tune the size of the surface area and the physicochemical property of an antibody's paratope. The IGHV3-23 * 01 dataset was again used in this analysis. To avoid bias introduced by irregular framework, all antibody sequences used in this analysis were manually validated to be free of framework insertions or deletions. Similarly, to avoid bias introduced by skewed CDR-H3 amino acid usage, all IGHV3-23 * 01 sequences were manually validated on the diversity to remove redundant sequences or sequences with irregular CDR loops, framework deletions or insertions. First, we determined the relationship between CDR-H3 length and the SASA of the antibody paratope. Simulated models were built by pairing human IGHV3-23 * 01 variable region, of various CDR-H3 length ranging from 7aa to 23aa, with human IGKV1-39 * 01/IGKJ2 variable region. IGKV1-39 was chosen because the VH3-23/VK1-39 pairing was considered a very productive VH/VL pairing with good drug like properties [34,35]. The SASA values were calculated based on Kabat numbering of the antibody CDR loops. In this analysis, the only variables are the CDR-H3 length and the choices of various JH. As shown in Fig. 4A, a positive correlation was observed. As CDR-H3 went longer, the SASA of antibody paratope grew bigger from 3008.88 \u00b1 116.10 A 2 of 7aa length to 3666.42 \u00b1 224.78 A 2 of 23aa length. Interestingly, when CDR-H3 is longer than 22 amino acids, the SASA remained stagnant. This observation needs to be further validated with more IGHV3-23 * 01 sequences of extra CDR-H3 length.",

            "text": "The resulting humanized antibody, hz1E11, showed almost identical affinity and biological activity to the parental antibody (Fig 2 ). Selection of residues for randomization is a critical step in targeted randomization approach of affinity maturation because of the practical limitations of antibody library size and the selection technologies. Alanine scanning and in silico analysis of the antibody sequence, especially in CDRs, are useful for selecting the randomization target residues and facilitate the affinity maturation process. In alanine scanning analysis of CDR-H3 of hz1E11, the G98A mutant completely lost binding activity and the G97A mutant showed reduced binding activity (Fig 3A). Direct alteration of an essential paratope residue usually results in the total loss of binding ability of the antibody [26,33,36]. Therefore, a more conservative approach to CDR-H3 randomization was employed, using either a hand-mixed oligonucleotide that is biased toward the parental sequence, or the twin NNS random codon scanning of CDR-H3. As expected from the alanine scanning analysis, almost all clones that were isolated from the CDR-H3 libraries had the sequence 97 H -100a H same as the parental clone (G 97H GTAS 100aH ). \n\nThe alanine scanning results suggest that all CDR-L3 residues are dispensable, although some of the mutations seems to lower the affinity (Fig 3B). Therefore, four positions of CDR-L3 (91 L -94 L ) were fully randomized using the NNK degenerate codon. The sequence analysis of the selected clones confirmed the alanine scanning analysis; the majority of the selected clones from the CDR-L3 library had all four randomized CDR-L3 positions changed from the parental residue, contrary to the CDR-H3 optimization results in which most of the selected clones from the libraries had the same sequence as the parental hz1E11 in the middle part of the CDR (Table 1). The clones with most affinity improvement came from the CDR-L3 library.",

Finally, sidechains are added to the resultant structure and it is refined. current databases, which can be a problem for CDR-H3 where templates for longer loop length are often unavailable (94). This lack of templates is primarily due to the huge diversity of CDR-H3 shapes (96). An alternative to homology methods in such cases is ab initio modeling which does not rely on knowledge of already solved structures. These modeling methods create a large number of potential conformations, often referred to as decoys (97), which makes them computationally expensive compared with homology methods. Ab initio approaches include RosettaAntibody (98) and PLOP (99). RosettaAntibody is accessible online via the ROSIE (100) website, where a quick antibody modeling option is available which omits the step of intensive searching for low-energy CDR-H3 conformations. Hybrid loop modeling methodologies leverage the advantages of both modeling paradigms. For instance, Accelrys creates an initial loop model with a knowledge-based approach followed by ab initio loop refinement (101). More recently, a novel CDR-H3 modeling tool, Sphinx, was developed (102), inspired by the length-independent canonical CDR clustering of Nowak et al. (44). Sphinx outperformed all modeling tools on CDR-H3 structure prediction in an ex post facto comparison to the antibody modeling assessment (80). Despite development of different approaches, no single tool currently exists that is able to reliably model native CDR-H3 configurations. Accurate predictions of the CDR-H3 specifically and other CDRs in general are crucial to structurally characterize the antibody-antigen complex. Performance of antibody modeling tools has been assessed in two blind studies, AMA-I and AMA-II (80,103), where several computational tools were benchmarked against a small number of X-ray solved but unpublished antibody crystal structures. Models of frameworks and canonical CDRs are usually accurate within 1-1.5 \u00c5 root mean square deviation (RMSD), respectively",

            "text": "The clonality and the diversity of the 227 recombinant rabbit antibodies were assessed by analyzing the VH and VL sequences. The analysis of the B-cell clone specific VH and VL sequences confirmed that the single B-cell deposition led to complete monoclonal B-cell clones since only a single VH and VL sequence was identified for each of the 227 antibody-encoding plasmids. This was also confirmed by sequencing the top 20 antibodies after subcloning of the respective E. coli clones. Of each of the selected antibodies 5 plasmids were sequenced resulting in a single sequence of each of the antibodies. The diversity of the 227 IL1RL1-binding antibodies was evaluated on the amino acid level by analyzing the CDR-H3 length distribution, the frequency of amino acid replacement mutations in the VHs and the clustering of the CDR-H3 and CDR-L3 sequences of the antibodies. The CDR-H3 length varied between 4 and 19 amino acid residues resulting in a normal Poisson distribution with a mean value of 11.462.7 residues (Figure 4A and Table 5) as previously reported for rabbit antibodies isolated by phage display using the spleen of immunized rabbits (11.663.1) [3]. The mean values were comparable for the different animals and bleeds (Table 5). In addition, we compared the frequency of amino acid replacement mutations in VHs with the matching VHa1 or VHa3 germ line sequences. The rabbit VH, DH, JH and VL germ line gene sequences used for  comparison were collected from different sources [32,[41][42][43][44][45]. Per each VH 2 to 36 amino acid replacements were present with a median peak around 10 to 14 and a mean value of 1365.3 replacements, representing clearly diversified VH regions (Figure 4B and Table 5). Also, in that case no significant difference was observed between animals and bleeds. 5), whereas, in some cases (2 clusters for animal #68, 6 for animal #69 and 4 for animal #70) members of a cluster were found in different bleeds.",

            "text": "In the case of synthetic generation of diversity using trinucleotide synthesis, the method allows for the full control of the amino acid composition in the CDRs. This has, for example, been used to generate minimalistic antibody libraries constructed with as few as two amino acids in the randomized CDR region [19,20]. Semi-synthetic libraries with different combinations of synthetically and naturally host derived diversity have also been created. \n\nUnlike the immunized and na\u00efve libraries, the synthetic and semisynthetic libraries can be made using only one or few of the antibody framework repertoires. This reduces the contribution to diversity from the interface residues bordering the CDRs. It has, however, been shown, both in vitro and in vivo, that some variable (V) segments are much more commonly used in functional antibodies than others. Furthermore there are great differences in the stability and suitability for bacterial expression between different frameworks [21,22]. \n\nFollowing the creation of large libraries of recombinant antibodies, systems, which allow sorting of the libraries, need to be introduced and here display of the recombinant antibodies on the surface of the filamentous bacteriophage (phage) have played a pioneering role. The application known as \"phage display\" was first developed by G.P Smith in 1985 [23]. In phage display a foreign protein is expressed in fusion with one of the phage capsid proteins by cloning the foreign DNA sequence into the same reading frame as the gene of the chosen capsid protein. The major strength of phage display is the physical coupling between the phenotype (the fusion protein) and the genotype (the DNA inside the virion encoding the fusion protein). This coupling allows for high throughput selection of desirable properties of the fusion protein from libraries with billions of variants. There are two very important aspects of phage display selection of recombinant antibodies, namely the nature and quality of the material containing the antigen selected against, and perhaps more overlooked the quality and design of the displayed antibody library itself.",

            "text": "To investigate whether the use of kappa or lambda is associated with particular heavy chain properties, we measured a variety of physicochemical properties of CDR-H3 amino acid sequences obtained from the paired heavy-light chain variable region sequences of na\u00efve B cells from three donors (20) and compared the values from heavy chains paired with kappa light chains to heavy chains paired with lambda light chains (see Supplementary Figure 3 in the Supplementary Data Sheet for cumulative frequency plots, which confirm that the light chain isotypes of this published dataset separate in the same way as those from our dataset, as shown in Figure 1A). To account for donor variability, we plotted the kappa and lambda antibody CDR-H3 repertoires of each donor separately (Figure 4A). We then compared the kappa and lambda CDR-H3 property distributions for each donor individually using the KS test. We found that for many of the properties (e.g., GRAVY index, Boman index, and aliphatic index), there was no significant difference between the repertoires for any of the donors. However, we did find that for Donor 2, the lambda repertoire CDR-H3 regions were significantly shorter than the kappa repertoire, and for Donors 1 and 2, we found that the lambda repertoire had a significantly lower CDR-H3 pIs than the kappa repertoire. We also looked at IGHV-D-J family usage in the kappa and lambda repertoires of the three donors (Figure 4B) and found no significant difference in frequency [multiple t-tests and FDR correction (Q = 1%)]. The small differences in CDR-H3 physicochemical properties appear to be donor-specific with no overarching effects. This leads us to believe that despite the large differences between kappa and lambda CDR-L3 physicochemical properties, heavy-light chain pairing is virtually random, although there may be some very subtle biases which are specific to individuals.",

            "text": "Antibodies have emerged as one of the fastest growing classes of biotherapeutic proteins. To improve the rational design of antibodies, we investigate the conformational diversity of 16 different germline combinations, which are composed of 4 different kappa light chains paired with 4 different heavy chains. In this study, we systematically show that different heavy and light chain pairings strongly influence the paratope, interdomain interaction patterns and the relative VH-VL interface orientations. We observe changes in conformational diversity and substantial population shifts of the complementarity determining region (CDR) loops, resulting in distinct dominant solution structures and differently favored canonical structures. Additionally, we identify conformational changes in the structural diversity of the CDR-H3 loop upon different heavy and light chain pairings, as well as upon changes in sequence and structure of the neighboring CDR loops, despite having an identical CDR-H3 loop amino acid sequence. These results can also be transferred to all CDR loops and to the relative VH-VL orientation, as certain paratope states favor distinct interface angle distributions. Furthermore, we directly compare the timescales of sidechain rearrangements with the well-described transition kinetics of conformational changes in the backbone of the CDR loops. We show that sidechain flexibilities are strongly affected by distinct heavy and light chain pairings and decipher germline-specific structural features co-determining stability. These findings reveal that all CDR loops are strongly correlated and that distinct heavy and light chain pairings can result in different paratope states in solution, defined by a characteristic combination of CDR loop conformations and VH-VL interface orientations. Thus, these results have broad implications in the field of antibody engineering, as they clearly show the importance of considering paired heavy and light chains to understand the antibody binding site, which is one of the key aspects in the design of therapeutics.",

Choices for H3 and L3 were made together as we found an antibody structure with high homologies in both loops that provided a good model for the L3-H3 interaction. \n\nWe chose PDB entry 2G75 61 as the C10 wild-type template because it consists of an IGHV1/IGLV3 variable domain pair like the C10 antibody. As a l3/l1 fusion, the Vl3 chain still contains approximately 2/3 of the l3 light chain, so 2G75 represents this antibody well. The CDRs of 2G75 represent the most likely conformations of H1 (H1-13-10), H2 (H2-10-1), L1 (L1-11-3), and L2 (L2-8-1). 24,29 The C10 model based on 2G75 requires grafting the L3-H3 coordinates from another structure, since the CDR3 lengths in 2G75 are not the same as those in C10. We chose PDB entry 2FB4, 62 an IGHV3-30/ IGLV1-44 framework, for both grafts. The grafted 2FB4 L3 backbone was left unchanged, while the grafted 2FB4 H3 was in part remodeled using the UCSF Chimera package and its interface to Modeler. 63 In the partial remodeling of the H3, we preserved the disulfide-bonded loop in 2FB4 (sequence CSSASC) to model the same segment in C10 (sequence CSSTSC) and most of the interface with L3. \n\nThe H1, L1, H3, and L3 CDRs from the C10 model were grafted onto the structure of an IGHV1-69/IGKV3-20 antibody (PDB 1RHH 30 ) in order to model C10KV3.",

            "text": "The vertebrate immune system produces a diverse set of antibody sequences and structures for the purpose of recognizing foreign antigens on the surfaces of microorganisms and bacteria as well as aberrant self-antigens. The sequences of antibody proteins are produced by immunoglobulin genes that have been rearranged by a process known as V(D)J recombination at distinct genetic loci that contain multiple copies of each segment of the final recombined gene, consisting of one choice each of the variable region (V), the di-versity segment (D, found only in heavy chain genes), and the joining region (J), which is followed by the constant region (C) (1). Most mammalian, fish and avian antibodies consist of a heavy chain and a light chain, each of which is the product of V(D)J or VJ recombination, respectively. In each species, the light chain may be generated by one or more loci, generating additional diversity; for instance, in most mammals the kappa and lambda loci are used to generate light chain proteins. \n\nSince the first antibody sequences and structures were determined in the 1960s and 1970s (2)(3)(4), attempts have been made to classify the complementarity determining regions or CDRs both by sequence and by structure. The earliest comprehensive attempts on structure were those of Chothia et al. (5,6), who coined the term 'canonical structures' for the antibody CDRs, indicating that each CDR (L1, L2, L3, H1, H2, H3) might only adopt a few common structures based on length and sequence. As more structures were determined, the early classifications were extended in the mid 1990s by Chothia et al. (7) and Thornton et al. (8). These classifications were updated periodically in the following decade (9), and other classifications have appeared of subsets of the current PDB (e.g. H3 CDRs or chains) (10)(11)(12). Nikoloudis et al. have recently presented a hierarchical clustering of antibody CDR structures, based on the PDB as of December 2011 (13), but not as a server or a database.",

However, this CDR-H3 is very short -only four amino acids -and contains two Gly residues, which are highly abundant in rabbit CDR-H3 loops (see above). Therefore, the low frequency of occurrence of this CDR-H3 in BM and SP seems to be a random event. Notably, 6 of the other 8 top ranked VH regions are combinations of CDR-H3 loops with IGHV1S69, which was over-represented in the IM sample. Hence, it is tempting to speculate that some of these sequences are the product of positive selection by the peptide or the carrier used in the immunization, and thus could lead to specific antibodies. \n\nThe CDR-L3 of 28-8 was found in 24 of 11,215 (0.2%) sequences in the IM sample. It ranked at 102 among the IM CDR-L3 loops (data not shown). Similar to the observation on CDR-H3, the CDR-L3 was not found in the BM and SP samples comprising 51,705 and 61,728 sequences, respectively, indicating positive selection. Moreover, two VL sequences from IM were identical to 28-8 VL, both derived from the IGHV1S41 germline gene. Assuming that the abundance of specific V regions in the NGS sample correlates with the abundance of circulating B cells producing the specific V regions, and that these B-cells have been selected in part by their specificity and affinity to the antigen, the difference in ranking between VH and VL suggests a stronger selection for VH than for VK. If so, it implies that, although the VH repertoire of rabbit antibodies is restricted to the use of one or two IGHV and IGHJ germline genes, VH has a leading role in the rabbit immune response as in others species such as humans and mice.",

Before search, target sequences are pre-aligned using a canonical alignment of 200 unique antibody positions. Once an antibody has been entered into a pre-aligned database this calculation does not have to be repeated even when new data is added. For search, a query and the specific region to search, for example whole variable domain or CDRs, is specified. The query is then aligned using the canonical alignment and matched with each aligned target sequence. The specific region mask is then applied before calculating the sequence identity for the region. The exact method for sequence identity calculation is either with or without length match. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ especially the CDRs, is often used when looking for similar binders 17 . With the majority of the residues involved in binding being located in the CDRs, the sequence identity over these regions is often more relevant than that of the whole antibody. For some applications, the exact set of residues involved in the paratope may be known. In these cases, searching based on the sequence identity of the paratope may be even more informative (see Fig. 1c).",

We also checked which antibody region harbored the liabilities in the germlines. As expected, most of them are located in the Complementarity-Determining Regions (CDRs), confirming the typical approach of focusing on CDRs for liability detection that can reduce drug efficiency (see Fig 5). It is known that the definition of CDRs and the Vernier zone varies between numbering schemes [30]. This raises a question to what extent our choice of IMGT numbering for CDR definition affects liabilities being missed in the Vernier zone. Fig 5 shows that there are indeed liabilities in the Vernier zones, namely CDR-H3 to FW-H3, FW-L1-CDR-L1, and CDR-L2-FW-L2. In each case liability within the boundary meant one residue in the CDR and the other in the framework. Otherwise, the number of liabilities beyond CDRs and such one-residue boundaries is very low. Therefore, employing the IMGT definition accounting for +1 residue around the CDRs accounts for most of the liabilities. \n\nAltogether, our results demonstrate that identifying liabilities by simple sequence motifs reveals a multitude of potential issues with many of these, likely to be of germline origin. There appears to be no dataset-specific pattern. The large proportion of universally present liability motifs confirms that the majority of them are likely to be false positives if the predictions are made using the amino acid sequences of the antibody light and heavy chains alone. Despite this limitation, sequence-based physicochemical liability predictions are a useful tool at the earliest stages of biological drug discovery where a large number of potential hits need to be prioritized for the initial experimental characterization. Such predictions could be further refined by considering the importance of the chemical degradation liability and its location in the antibody sequence. Furthermore, performing antibody structure predictions and Table 2. The mean number of liabilities per sequence for each dataset in our study.",

            "text": "There were a number of possible explanations for this modest difference in potencies, compared with the potentially enormous difference in diversity of the starting pools, one of which is that, as both sets of selections started from a pool of VH and VL CDR3 mutants derived via phage display selections, there may already be a pre-selected bias in the structural diversity, e.g., for bacterial expression and folding in the periplasm. The greater potential diversity of the ribosome displayed VH/VL recombinations may not therefore represent as high a functional diversity as, say, if the initial selections on the individual VH and VL CDR3 libraries had been performed in the ribosome display format. We are currently investigating whether such an approach would lead to further improvements in diversity and final affinity and potency of selected antibodies. Alternatively, there may be a potency ceiling for the biological system, (IL-1 \u03b2 binding to IL-1RI) being investigated here. It is intriguing that the natural antagonist for IL-1RI, IL-1Ra, has a very similar potency in the biological assays, particularly as the lead antibodies generated here appear to be binding in a similar location as the natural antagonist, as demonstrated by competitive binding (Fig. 3), even with a substantially higher affinity for IL-1R1 (Jedi067: monovalent K D = 2.5 pM; Fig. S2), compared with that of the reported antagonist (150 pM). Previous reports of antibodies generated against the IL-1RI, with a similar competitive mechanism of action also exhibited very similar potencies to the IL-1Ra, suggesting a limit to achievable potency when targeting this epitope. \n\nTaken together, these hypotheses may also explain why, physiologically, there are multiple strategies to inhibit the potent activity of IL-1, which include IL-1Ra but also release of soluble receptors (solIL-1RI, solIL-1RII), as well as a non-signaling decoy receptor (IL-1RII). 16,17",

            "text": "After three rounds of pannings, the enriched Fab encoding sequences were subcloned as pools into the pYBex10 Fab expression vector. Antigen-specific Fabs were identified by ELISA, where a positive hit was defined by binding to its specific target with a signal at least 5-fold above the assay background. 54,55 Overall, 2,900 to 5,200 clones were screened per target antigen with primary hit rates ranging from 1% to 49%. Sequencing of up to 785 positive hits revealed 7 to 284 CDR-H3 unique antibodies per antigen, although the total diversity of selected antibodies will most likely be much higher because only a minor fraction of the clonal panning output was screened and sequenced. Notably, a low hit rate was only observed with challenging targets, e.g., anti-idiotype selection, due to the relative scarcity of unique epitopes on the target antigen (binding interface of human IgG1 antibody). So far, antibodies from 27 distinct VH/VL combinations (out of 36 VH/VL pairings) were identified. Different target antigens thereby favor different VH/VL pairings (data not shown), arguing for increased framework diversity representing an advantage over current in vitro technologies for antibody discovery on complex targets. Monovalent affinities were determined by surface plasmon resonance measurements (Biacore/GE Healthcare) only for a small subset of antibodies. K D values as low as 700 pM (k on 2.4E+05 M -1 s -1 , k off 1.7E-04 sec -1 ) against a protein antigen were found confirming that high affinity antibodies can be isolated directly Library size, sequence correctness and diversity. The theoretical diversities for the V\u03ba region and V\u03bb region CDR-L3 range from 3.8E+06 to 2.5E+9. For the smaller V\u03ba CDR-L3 libraries, we aimed for a minimum library size of 5-fold above the theoretical diversity.

            "text": "During panning of a phage-displayed antibody library, the selection outcome is determined not only by the binding affinity to the target antigen, but also in large part by the display level and/or growth rates of the clones. The diversity of the panning output may be reduced greatly as a result, because of the preferential enrichment of a small number of binders with significant display/growth advantage, or the faster amplification of some nonbinders or non-producers. Even within a synthetic antibody library that employs a fixed framework scaffold, wide variation in the amplification efficiency among the clones was observed, suggesting that CDR sequences have a significant influence on the enrichment of antibody clones during biopanning. \n\nA synthetic scFv library with pre-defined CDR sequences was designed and constructed previously (OPAL-S) [3]. It should be noted that although the reported size of OPAL-S was 8 \u00d7 10 8 , the library used in this study was expanded to 1.3 \u00d7 10 10 through additional transformations and is comparable in size to OPAL-T (1.4 \u00d7 10 10 , Table 1). Since the designed diversity of each CDR in this library was between 10 3 -10 4 , we were able to track the change in relative abundance of every predefined CDR sequence before and after biopanning against protein A by NGS. Non-H3 CDR sequences of OPAL-S were designed individually by simulating somatic hypermutations to the human germline CDR sequences, and thus they were traceable to their germline ancestors. From the analysis of panning enrichment patterns of the CDR sequences, with the exception of CDR-H2, the germline origin of CDR sequences appeared not to have marked influence on the amplification of scFv clones in the context of the VH3-23, V\u03ba3-20, and V\u03bb1-47 scaffolds.",

            "text": "However, a search using the Abcheck server (Martin, 1996) identified seven unusual residues within the antibody structure; C91, C93, D97 and I106 from the light chain and Y28, R34 and Q54 from the heavy chain, all within the CDR loops. In particular, C91, C93 and D97 all lie in CDR3 of the light chain, perhaps facilitating its interaction with linker 2. Indeed, the most unusual residue is C93, which is found in only 0.096% of light chains, and is the residue that forms a disulphide bond with linker 2 (Figure 1B). The heavy chain CDR H3 loop has a base that adopts the 'kinked' conformation (Shirai et al., 1999), with the loop rapidly spreading to the two termini of LAIR1. \n\nIn previous structures of antibodies with extended heavy chain CDR3 loops, the remaining five CDRs of the antibody are exposed, with the potential to engage in antigen binding (McLellan et al., 2011;Stanfield et al., 2016, Wang et al., 2013). One of the remarkable features of the LAIR1-containing antibody is therefore the occlusion of large parts of each of the remaining five CDRs, with these loops each interacting directly with the LAIR1 insert and/or linkers (Figure 1B, Table 2). The degree of occlusion of the CDRs by LAIR1 was determined by accessibility to a 1.4 A \u02daprobe in the presence and absence of LAIR1 and the linkers. Each of these five CDR loops was partly occluded by the presence of LAIR1 or the linkers (occluding 12.7% of the accessible surface area of CDR L1, 18.3% of CDR L2, 47.3% of CDR L3, 34.7% of CDR H1 and 16.0% of CDR H2). Indeed, both the first and second CDRs of the heavy chain directly contact the LAIR1 insert (Table 2).",

            "text": "2][3][4] Description of the binding properties 5 and characterization of the paratope 6 is essential for understanding the function of the antibody. ][9][10] Mainly the CDR loops of the heavy chain 11 are involved in antigen-binding, especially the CDR-H3 loop. 12 4][15] The backbone conformations of the CDR loops except the CDR-H3 loop have been classified into canonical structures according to their loop length and sequence composition. 7,16 ][19] Furthermore, the CDR-H3 loop length and structure can have an effect on the antigen-binding patterns of the other CDR loops and influence the specificity of the paratope for target antigens. 13 o understand the role of the CDR-H3 loop during antigen binding processes, appropriate sampling techniques must be used. 20 ntibody-antigen binding can be interpreted in terms of the conformational selection mechanism. This paradigm follows the idea of an ensemble of pre-existing conformations with different probabilities from which the binding-competent state is selected. 21,22 Transitions between different states in this preexisting conformational space can occur on different timescales, and therefore calculations of the thermodynamics and kinetics are essential for better understanding and characterization of their conformational diversity. 23 n this study, we applied metadynamics in combination with classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations as a reliable tool to capture the structural and the dynamic properties of proteinbinding, peptide-binding and hapten-binding antibody CDR-H3 loops. We present a strategy to gather a diverse, thermodynamically and kinetically meaningful conformational ensemble of the CDR-H3 loop in solution. Due to its inherent flexibility and tendency to adopt novel conformations, the CDR-H3 loop can be understood as a conformational ensemble. We chose examples of three categories of antibodies binding to proteins, peptides and haptens to analyze the CDR-H3 loop conformational ensemble (SI Table S1).",

Length diversity is included within CDRs L3 and H3 and amino acid diversity is included within CDRs L3 and H3 and solvent-accessible positions of CDRs H1 and H2 (Figures 2A,B). We hypothesized that the additional diversity in Library-F (length diversity in CDRL3 and amino acid diversity in CDRs H1/H2) would generate higher affinity and more selective Fabs against Notch-1. Solid-phase panning of Library-F was conducted against the Notch-1 extracellular domain. To identify Fabs with different CDRH3 lengths, we sequenced the CDRH3 region of the Fab-phage selection outputs using Ion Torrent sequencing (Rothberg et al., 2011). We monitored changes in CDRH3 length distribution over five rounds of selection (Figure 2C). We observed a prominent enrichment in three short CDRH3 lengths (8, 9, and 10 residues). Four other CDRH3 lengths (14, 15, 17, and 19 residues) were also enriched albeit at lower frequencies, ranging between 2% and 7%. We ranked round 3 CDRH3 sequences based on their relative frequencies.",

The first is from the recombination of the VDJ (variable/diversity/joining) gene segments that code for the heavy chain and VJ gene segments that code for the light chain. The second is from the combinatorial potential of the heavy and light chains, which can profoundly influence the nature of the combining site typically found at their interface. The third is due to the phenomenon of \"affinity maturation,\" where B cells can be stimulated by activated T-cells to subject their heavy and light chain genes to high levels of somatic mutation in an effort to produce mutant antibodies with higher avidity (1)(2)(3)(4).\n\nCarbohydrate antigens are particularly interesting as they generally cannot induce affinity maturation (5)(6)(7)(8), and it has been suggested that the antibody repertoire has evolved to contain gene segments suited for immediate recognition of carbohydrate mono-, oligo-, and polysaccharides associated with pathogens (10 -12).\n\nAlthough the pool of potential antigens is seemingly limitless, mammalian genomes code for a finite number of gene segments that are under constant pressure to confer a survival advantage, and the germ-line has evolved to code for an anti-body repertoire that can recognize common as well as new pathogens.\n\nThe correspondence between the amino acid residues in the heavy chain VDJ and light chain VJ gene segments and the nature of the combining site has come from three-dimensional structural studies, which have shown that antigen is bound via a cluster of polypeptide loops called \"complementarity determining regions\" (CDRs), 3 three on each chain labeled L1, L2, L3, H1, H2, and H3. The L1, L2, and L3 CDRs are coded by the light chain V gene, whereas H1 and H2 are coded by the heavy chain V gene. Significantly, CDR H3 is coded largely by the heavy chain D and J gene segments.\n\nThere has been considerable speculation about the relative importance of the six CDRs.

The sFab library has varied sequences that are biased for serine and tyrosine in the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of their light (L) and heavy (H) chains within variable domains (32,33). After several rounds of selection to increase stringency, two sFabs, termed COP-2 and COP-3, were further developed and validated by ELISA to bind to claudin-4/cCpE. Both COPs were sequenced and isolated to characterize their binding further. Sequence alignments of COP-2 and COP-3 reveal that COP-2 and COP-3 share 98.2 and 93.3% sequence identity in their L and H chains, respectively; and that COP sequences diverge the greatest in CDR-L3, CDR-H1, and CDR-H3 (Supporting Information (SI) Fig. S1). These residue divergences may direct COP-specific recognition of claudin-4-cCpE complexes.",

            "text": "Today, a wide variety of antibody phage display libraries exist, with the antibodies displayed either as Fabs, scFvs (single-chain variable fragments) or sdAbs (single-domain antibodies) in fusion with typically the gene III coat protein (6,7) (Fig. 1). The small size and solubility of the phage particle (up to 10 13 particles/ml) has allowed repertoire sizes of up to 10 11-12 to be efficiently displayed and manipulated, which improves the likelihood of finding suitable antibodies (8). These antibody sequences can be obtained from natural sources (animal or human) or synthetically constructed [usually a mix of pre-defined framework regions (FRs) with randomized sequences in the CDRs] and isolation of specific sequences is carried out by repeated enrichment against the target of interest. \n\nThe defining attribute of all phage display libraries is the physical linking of antibody phenotype (specificity and affinity) with genotype (sequence) via the phage particle-this allows for in vitro selection on immobilized antigen or whole cells (Fig. 2). As this method by-passes the immune system, the usual factors that influence antibody development and limit diversity based on those that can be isolated in animals are not applicable. As such, antibodies can be isolated against targets that have low immunogenicity in animals (nonproteinaceous antigens), to regions of a protein not usually targeted due to the presence of immunodominant epitopes elsewhere, or to hydrophobic targets that are challenging for in vivo manipulation (9)(10)(11). As such, phage display offers high potential for discovery of novel therapeutic antibodies that cannot be generated naturally through in vivo immunization or infection. Furthermore, the ability to display synthetic repertoires devoid of any negative selection has made this technique a key method for the generation of potent fully human antibody therapeutics against self-antigens (12). Nixon et al. provide an in-depth review of the clinical development of such drugs (13). Polyclonal phage expressing recombinant antibodies on their surface is applied to target antigen presented as either immobilized on a magnetic bead, polystyrene surface or on the surface of a whole cell.",

            "text": "The size and quality of diversity design and functional clones of the antibody library are crucial for the success of isolating potential therapeutic antibodies (20)(21)(22). A number of strategies have been undertaken to design and construct large antibody libraries with high functional diversity, which are comprised of the number of correctly assembled clones without frameshift or stop codons (23-25), such as by synthesizing CDR sequences employing the trinucleotide mutagenesis (TRIM) technology or selecting inframe antibody clones by antibiotic selection systems (15,19). The TRIM approach uses a set of pre-synthesized trinucleotide codon units instead of single nucleotides, thereby has the ability to synthesize desired compositions at each CDR found in natural human antibodies and avoid frameshifts or stop codons (26). To rapidly isolate human antibodies with therapeutic potential, we designed and constructed a highly diverse synthetic human scFv library with greater than a giga in size named DSyn-1. The library design was based on high stability scaffolds and six CDRs that were tailored to mimic natural human compositions for a lower risk of immunogenicity. In addition, to maximize the number of in-frame clones with high expression levels, the antibody sequences were codon-optimized and the six CDRs with various CDR-H3 lengths were subjected to b-lactamase selection. To evaluate the Dsyn-1 library, phage panning was performed against five therapeutically relevant antigens including one peptide. Furthermore, to evaluate the library's potential for biomedical research applications, we generated antibodies targeting the T cell immunoglobulin-3 (TIM-3), which is a type I trans-membrane protein expressed on both adaptive and innate immune cells such as effector T cells, natural killer cells, dendritic cells, and monocytes (27,28). TIM-3 acts as an immune checkpoint inhibitor associated with anti-tumor immunity, and blockade of TIM-3 by antibodies has emerged as a potential therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment (29-31). In our library system, 204 unique antibodies recognizing TIM-3 were isolated and 25 were characterized via binding assays and in vitro analyses for inhibition ability.",

            "text": "The overall position of the CDR L3 loop in the antibodies' paratope did not differ significantly when switching binding partners. This is expected due to the loop's secondary structure, which is a short loop between two \u03b2-sheet folded structural elements. It is of particular importance to note that a small segment of the CDR L3 loop (residues W93-H97), which is not involved in the \u03b2-sheet structure, appears to differentiate the two states and significantly impacts binding properties. To analyze the overall positioning of the loops within the paratope, independent of individual loop conformations, we performed an alignment of the entire paratope (i.e., all six CDR loops). This analysis revealed increased flexibility for all loops, with the exception of CDR H1, which showed only a slight increase in flexibility upon hapten binding. These findings are presented in more detail in Figure S2. \n\nFrom the investigation of the free energy surfaces and from the comparison of relative displacements via RMSDs, we have found that the largest effect discriminating between the two binding conformations comes from the CDR L3 loop. We have further investigated this behavior by calculating the local flexibility via dihedral entropies. This analysis reflects the flexibility of the backbone \u03a8 angles, but does not reflect side chain rearrangements. We clearly saw that the last quarter of the CDR L3 loop has much less flexibility in the simulations of the hapten-binding competent conformations, both with and without hapten present during the simulation. When comparing the protein-complex simulation to the hapten-complex simulation, we could further determine restrictions in the dihedral entropies in the CDR L1, L2 and H3 loops for the simulations with the hapten present. Regarding the overall flexibility, it can be noted that the presence of the hapten decreased the dihedral entropy of the previously mentioned CDR loops, thus restricting their flexibility. An exception for this rigidification is observed in the tail of the CDR H3 loop, which is slightly more rigid in absence of the hapten. The calculated overall mean dihedral entropies are \u22120.54",

Strategy for CDR strip generation and sequencing. ssDNA rescued from round-3 phage pools is subjected to Kunkel mutagenesis for deleting the intervening framework regions between diversified CDRs. This step links the diversified CDRs next to each other (L3-H3 from Library-S selections and L3-H1-H2-H3 from Library-F selections) without losing the CDR pairing information. The product from the mutagenesis reaction is used as a template to generate a PCR amplicon of the CDR strip. Quantified, multiplexed amplicons are subjected to emulsion PCR and Ion Torrent sequencing. L3-H3 and L3-H1-H2-H3 strips are sequenced on 200 and 400 bp chips, respectively. gel-purified product was used as a template to generate a PCR amplicon of the CDR strip. Quantified, multiplexed amplicons were subjected to emulsion PCR and Ion Torrent sequencing.\n\nTo reconstruct Fab clones from the CDR strip sequencing information, we cloned desired CDR combinations into the Fab-4D5 encoding phagemid by Kunkel mutagenesis (Figure 2). A Hu4D5-8 Fab-encoding phagemid whose CDRs have been replaced with NotI sites was used as a template to reconstruct Fab clones. Primers were designed to encode for a desired CDR sequence and to hybridize to either side of the CDR. Two or four primers were used to reconstruct Fab clones from Library-S (19) or Library-F (20) selections, respectively. Following mutagenesis, the reaction was transformed into E. coli and positive clones were screened by NotI digestion. Kunkel reactions outlined in Figures 1 and 2 serve different purposes. In Figure 1, the Kunkel reaction was used to link diversified CDRs together with fixed primer sequences (ssDNA template was variable). In Figure 2, the Kunkel reaction was used to reconstruct Fab phagemids using variable primers (ssDNA template was constant for all Fabs)",

            "text": "Even though, the CDR-H1 loop has the same length and sequence in all four free energy landscapes, we observe significant differences in flexibility, which are also reflected in differently sampled canonical clusters and shifts in dominant solution structures. The majority of available canonical clusters (H1-13) are present within our ensemble, only with varying probabilities. Especially interesting are the CDR-H1 loops of the H1-69:L3-20 and H1-69:L4-1 (5I17 and 5I18), as they sample an additional canonical cluster (H1-13-6), which is not captured within the ensembles of other CDR-H1 loops. Figure 1B illustrates the free energy landscapes of the CDR-H2 loops. Also, for the CDR-H2 loop an effect of different light chain pairings on the respective CDR-H2 loop ensembles can be identified. In line with the observations for the CDR-H1 loop, we find strong pairing specific population shifts of the CDR-H2 loops. This is especially true for the H1-69:L3-20 and H1-69:L4-1 (5I17 and 5I18) Fab fragments, where we sample two additional canonical clusters (H2-10-2 and H2-10-4), compared to the other CDR-H2 loops consisting of germline H1-69. The free energy landscapes of the CDR-H3 loop are depicted in Figure 1C. While the CDR-H3 loops of H1-69:L1-39 and H1-69: L3-11 (5I15 and 5I16) cover a similar conformational space, again H1-69:L3-20 and H1-69:L4-1 (5I17 and 5I18) differ substantially in their flexibility and state populations. As for the CDR-H3 loop no canonical clusters could be assigned, we projected the available 16 X-ray structures into the tICA space, which already reveal a high conformational diversity.",

            "text": "To efficiently generate antigen-specific bovine ultralong CDR-H3 paratopes, a platform process was established that relies on engrafting amplified CDR-H3 regions following immunization onto a single bovine \u00d7 human chimeric Fab scaffold. Yeast surface display was employed to sample the resulting diversities. In this respect, yeast surface display has proven to be versatile for engineering different antibody derivatives (36)(37)(38)(39)(40)(41) but also more complex molecules such as cytokines (42), ligands (43), or cysteine-rich miniproteins (44,45). More recently, Sahin and colleagues could demonstrate that disulfide-rich peptides can also be enriched by phage display (46), substantiating the versatility of display technologies for engineering of more complex molecules. After immunization, an immune response was detected in all immunized cattle. However, since the total IgG titer was detected, it cannot be determined specifically how the response evolved regarding ultralong CDR-H3 antibodies and whether titers involved ultralong CDR-H3 entities in all specimen. For YSD library construction, oligonucleotides were designed that address the unique genetics of ultralong CDR-H3 antibodies. IGHV1-7 that is preferentially used for the formation of ultralong cow antibodies ( 14) comprises an eight nucleotide duplication in its 3\u2032end (encoding for TTVHQ instead of AR/K) (12). This nucleotide extension has been specifically targeted by primer design, and sequencing of the initial library revealed a high functionality of clones displaying an ultralong CDR-H3 region (79.2%). Within two rounds of FACS-based selections, we were able to readily enrich for an antigen-binding population against EGFR that represents a promising target structure for anticancer therapy (26,27). From sequencing the sorting output, we found more than a dozen CDR-H3 unique clones belonging to eight distinct clonotypes.",

The CDR-H3 loop clustering in Figure 1 (bottom) identifies three highly populated clusters; the most populated cluster embodies the three different CDR-H3 loop crystal structure conformations. Figure 1 (bottom right) shows various conformational transitions between the clusters, and underlines the high sampling efficiency and conformational diversity. The resulting conformational ensemble corresponding to the dendrogram in Figure 1 for the CDR-H3 loop and the CDR-L3 loop (Figure 2) highlights the high structural variability of the CDR-H3 loop compared to the CDR-L3 loop. Figure 3 shows the estimated free energy surface of the CDR-L3 and CDR-H3 loop based on time-lagged independent component analysis (tICA) and illustrates that the CDR-H3 loop has a more shallow and broad free energy surface, while the CDR-L3 has more narrow and distinct minima.

            "text": "The diversity of sequences in the variable regions of immunoglobulins is the basis for the ability of these molecules to bind a virtually unlimited number of antigenic structures. Sequence diversity in the primary repertoire is created by recombination of germline segments for both the heavy and light chains which results in the formation of full-length immunoglobulin variable region exons (1). The light chain variable region is created by the joining of VL and JL germlines while the VH region is created by recombination of VH, DH (or D) and JH germlines. The process of recombination starts with the heavy chain in progenitor B cells, initiated by D/JH recombination followed by VH/DJH recombination (2,3). Light chain recombination occurs in pre-B cells after successful completion of the heavy chain recombination. Germline segments in both chains are also trimmed and extended by a variable number of nucleotides by exonucleolytic nibbling of germline segments and random nucleotide incorporation in the N-regions flanking the D germline mediated by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase and germline palindromic duplications (3). B cell clones with full-length, in-frame variable regions are further selected to remove or induce receptor editing of self-reactive clones to form the na\u00efve immune repertoire (4,5).\n\nThe third complementarity determining region (CDR) of the heavy chain (CDR H3) is the region of highest overall sequence and length diversity in antibody repertoires (1). CDR H3 length approximates a Gaussian distribution (6). Average CDR H3 length varies as a function of species, age, isotype, B cell development stage and disease state (6)(7)(8)(9)(10)(11)(12)(13). CDR H3 amino acid composition is also biased in a CDR H3 length-dependent manner, associated with differential incorporation of D and JH germline sequences of different lengths and sequence composition into CDR H3 of different lengths (6).

            "title": "Synthetic approach to the generation of antibody diversity",
            "text": "The simplest method for CDR diversification is the synthesis of random sequences using nucleotide mixtures. These degenerate codons are relatively easy to design and cost-efficient, and highly functional antibody libraries have been constructed using this method (8,10,11). The major limitation of this approach is the low precision of the sequence diversification. Unlike the trinucleotide phosphoramidites method or Slonomics technology (see below) that can incorporate any combination of codons at the desired position, the random degenerate codon method allows only those codons that are in the same row or column of the codon table, or the combination of such codons. For example, tyrosine (TAY, Y = T or C) and glycine (GGN) cannot be encoded by a same degenerate codon without also including cysteine (TGY) and aspartate (GAY). This poses a problem when one tries to design an antibody library that emulates natural CDR sequences, because many \"unnatural\" CDR sequences are also synthesized and incorporated into the library. However, it should be noted that this problem does not preclude the library from producing high-affinity, target-specific antibodies to most antigens. The trinucleotide phosphoramidite method, or trinucleotide-directed mutagenesis (TRIM), utilizes a set of pre-synthesized trinucleotide codon units for the synthesis of diversified CDRs (12)(13)(14). One can incorporate only the desired amino acids in a desired ratio at any position, by using mixtures of these units in the oligonucleotide synthesis. Consequently, CDRs can be designed to have more nature-like distribution of amino acids, thus making the antibodies better resemble the natural antibodies. HuCAL has TRIM-based diversity in CDR-H3 and CDR-L3, with the amino acid frequency roughly reflecting that found in natural CDRs. HuCAL GOLD has a more sophisticated design with all six CDRs diversified.",

            "text": "Such a substitution of both CDR-H and CDR-L was expected to further improve the binding affinity as well as the functional activity of the antibody. \n\nContrary to our expectations, the HER2-binding affinity of A058, which was substituted with W98, F100c, A101, and L102 in CDR-H3 (identical to AH06) and had 3 residues substituted with Q93, A96 and S97 in CDR-L3, was reduced to half that of hu4D5, although its anti-tumor activity against SK-BR-3 was similar to that of hu4D5. Therefore, the data suggest that the modification of CDR-L3 may be unable to largely contribute to the increase in HER2-binding affinity. \n\nNevertheless, AH06, with its 7.4-fold increase in binding affinity, was generated from LN02, which randomized 6 residues at positions #98, 100, 100b, 100c, 101 and 102 of CDR-H3 at a time. Consistent with our conclusion, it has been reported that the binding affinity of antibodies is increased by the substitutions of CDR-H3 residues, such as the 100c, 101 and 102 positions (Phumyen et al., 2012;Rajpal et al., 2005). \n\nIn addition, as Gerstner et al. (2002) mentioned, a role of W98 of CDR-H3 in HER2 binding is unclear. Here we provide a possible explanation for that using modeling analysis regarding improvement of binding affinity of AH06. The simulation modeling suggested direct hydrophobic interactions between the aromatic ring group of tryptophan residue (W98) of AH06 and the aliphatic group of isoleucine (I613) residue located in the domain IV of HER2, and also between the phenyl ring of F100c in CDR-H3 and the hydrophobic groups that consist of Y36, P44 and F98 located in V L (Fig. 7).",

            "text": "The rise of antibodies as important biotherapeutic proteins has sparked the interest in characterizing antibody structures and investigating structure-function relationships (1)(2)(3). Understanding the structural determinants and the involved conformational transitions governing antibody antigen recognition is critical for understanding antibody functions, in particular antibody specificity and consequently processes such as affinity maturation (4,5). \n\nThe antigen binding fragment (Fab) consists of a heavy and a light chain and can be divided into a constant and a variable domain. The variable fragment (Fv) exhibits the highest diversity of an antibody, as it is the focal point of somatic hypermutation and recombination events (6,7). This high diversity of the Fv is concentrated on six hypervariable loops, also known as the complementarity determining regions (CDRs), which form the antigen binding site, the paratope. To facilitate the structure prediction of antibodies, five of these six CDR loops have been assigned to so-called canonical clusters, assuming that they can only adopt a limited number of backbone conformations (5,(8)(9)(10)(11). Due to its unchallenged diversity in length, sequence and structure, no canonical clusters can be assigned for the CDR-H3 loop. Thus, structure prediction still remains challenging. In order to capture the high flexibility and diversity of the CDR-H3 loop and to functionally characterize all CDR loops, they have to be described as conformational ensemble in solution (12,13). Within the obtained CDR loop ensembles in solution, also transitions between the majority of canonical clusters and additional dominant solution structures were observed. \n\nTogether with the CDR loops, the relative V H -V L interdomain orientation plays an important role in determining the shape of the antigen binding site (4,(14)(15)(16). Various studies observed that mutations in the framework regions, in particular in the V H -V L interface, can result in structural changes of the binding site and hence can influence antigen recognition.",

Library F was designed to contain mostly binomial Tyr/Ser diversity in CDR-H1 and H2 and expanded diversity encoding the nine amino acids Tyr/Ser/ Gly/Ala/Phe/Trp/His/Pro/Val in a 5/4/4/2/1/1/1/1/1 ratio, at CDR-L3 and H3 (34). In addition, the CDR-L3 and H3 loops lengths vary in size. The expanded diversity in CDR-L3 and H3 in Library F was designed to mimic the distribution of amino acids in functional CDR-H3 segments of natural antibodies. We screened Library F against freshly purified monomeric BAX (10). After two to three rounds of selection, a panel of 14 BAXspecific Fabs with diverse CDR sequences was obtained (Fig. 1A). These clones were isolated from two distinct panning regimes, one in which biotinylated BAX was immobilized onto streptavidin-coated wells and another in which BAX was coated directly on the wells. The properties of the selected clones were similar from either screening regime and, therefore, analyzed further as a single conglomerated panel. Sequence comparison between the 14 Fabs revealed a high diversity of residues and loop sizes with no apparent sequence homology in CDR segments from any two clones, demonstrating the diverse modes of interaction with BAX. \n\nFabs were expressed and purified, and the EC 50 titers for BAX were determined using ELISA. The EC 50 values ranged from 2.3 nM (2B1) to 250 nM (2A5), with most Fabs having a single-or double-digit nanomolar EC 50 value (Fig. 1A). The selected Fabs 3G11, 3E8, 2A5, and 2B1 were evaluated for binding kinetics to monomeric BAX using biolayer interferometry (Fig. 1B).",

[10][11][12][13] Numerous studies have tried to classify antibody CDR loops structurally and sequentially, and correlate them with their locus and sequence to improve fast antibody structure prediction and design. [13][14][15][16] Additionally, several numbering systems for antibodies have been developed that are similar in the framework region but differ around the CDRs. [17][18][19][20] The PyIgClassify database assigns conformational clusters by determining the CDR sequences and lengths using the international ImMunoGeneTics information system\u00ae nomenclature 18 and calculating the dihedral angles \u03d5 and \u03c8 of the residues in each CDR. 13 Recent studies using molecular dynamics simulations extended the model of static canonical clusters to a characterization of the CDR-L3 and CDR-H3 loop as ensembles in solution by capturing several conformational transitions between different canonical structure medians. 21,22 We analyzed the conformational diversity of all CDR loops to identify transition probabilities and timescales between canonical CDR loop conformations of the same length, and to kinetically characterize the CDR loop ensembles in the solution for all CDR loops. Therefore, we chose the median crystal structures of the high-populated canonical clusters with a good resolution and used this median X-ray structure as the starting point for molecular dynamics simulations.",

            "text": "Recently, limited antibody pairings of domains have been proposed (47), and utilization of VL-VH interactions for immunoassay has been reported (48). Interestingly, the VL-VH contact area of anti-phosphocholine antibody ( McPC603) is \u03f31700 \u00c5 2 , despite the smaller area of contact between the antibody and the antigen (\u03f3290 \u00c5 2 ), than the case of protein antigen-antibody interaction (49). \n\nTherefore, one may conclude that an increase in affinity of our mutant antibody for a mutant target antigen is due not so much to improvements in complementarity around the mutated CDR-H2 loop as to subtle structural rearrangements of antigen, VL, and VH, which might lead to an increase in covered areas of CDR-L2, -L3, and -H1 upon complexation. We can conclude that these structural rearrangements increase the covered areas of VL-VH interfaces, resulting in an enhancement of the affinity of the mutant antibody fragment for the mutated antigen. The significant increase in interfacial areas of VL-VH interfaces in CDR-H3 should be emphasized, because antibodies that are highly diverse in CDR-H3 are created via genetic recombination in vivo (50,51). \n\nComplementarity of VH-VL in the SFSF\u2150TEL complex is less than in SFSF\u2150HEL. However, the covered area of VH-VL interface of SFSF\u2150TEL upon complexation is larger than SFSF\u2150HEL, and SFSF has more than 5-fold greater affinity for TEL than for HEL (28). This suggests that an increase in complementary association of VH with VL does not always lead to the enhancement of the affinity of antibodies. Cooperativity between variable regions upon complexation might not lead to improvement of interfacial complementarities, despite grafting high affinity of antibodies for the targets. \n\nThe structural analyses of three antigen-antibody complexes also highlight the critical role of residue 71 of VH in the tolerance of structural changes in CDR-H2 during induced fitting.",

            "text": "where %Recovered (with antigen) and %Recovered (without antigen) are calculated from 100 design decoys of 60 antibodies (6000 structures each). The recovery values (Fig 5A ) in the presence of antigen are all higher than the recovery values in the absence of antigen, with the exception of L3 where they are approximately equal. This is reflected in the ARR results (Fig 5B ) antigen risk ratios demonstrate that the native lengths and clusters are enriched particularly for the L1 and H2 CDRs in the presence of the antigen. For the other CDRs, the values are a little over 1.0, indicating that Rosetta prefers some of the more common clusters in the PDB, even in the absence of antigen. For the light-chain CDRs, we sampled only from lengths and clusters that contained at least 5 examples of structures from the same light-chain type, either \u03bb or \u03ba. Especially for L3, this choice strongly restricts the number of applicable lengths and clusters, and thus the antigen risk ratios for L3, like H1 and L2, are lower that one might expect otherwise. \n\nIn addition to optimizing the total energy, design simulations in RAbD can alternatively optimize the interface energy, which for our purposes is defined as the total Rosetta energy of the antibody-antigen complex minus the energy of the separated antibody and antigen after repacking and minimizing the energy of side-chain conformations of the interface residues. The %Recovered is greater than the %Sampled (Fig 6A ) for the lengths and clusters of all 5 CDRs, which is reflected in the DRR values. The cluster DRRs are greater than 1.5 for all 5 CDRs, while the length DRRs are only significantly above 1.0 for L1 which is the most lengthdiverse CDR for both \u03ba or \u03bb antibodies. \n\nTo further investigate the effect of the antigen's presence during the design phase, we performed sequence design on one CDR at a time (6 per target, including H3) starting from the native sequence and structure with and without the antigen present using the opt-E protocol described above (the opt-dG protocol does not make sense in the absence of the antigen and there is no straightforward way to calculate the sampling rate of amino acid types during the simulations).",

Antibody clones from synthetic libraries with optimized design features have several distinct advantages that include high stability, high levels of expression, and ease of downstream optimization and engineering. In this study, a fully synthetic human scFv library with six diversified CDRs was constructed by polymerase chain reaction assembly of overlapping oligonucleotides. In order to maximize the functional diversity of the library, a \u03b2-lactamase selection strategy was employed in which the assembled scFv gene repertoire was fused to the 5\u2032-end of the \u03b2-lactamase gene, and in-frame scFv clones were enriched by carbenicillin selection. A final library with an estimated total diversity of 7.6 \u00d7 109, greater than 70% functional diversity, and diversification of all six CDRs was obtained after insertion of fully randomized CDR-H3 sequences into this proofread repertoire. The performance of the library was validated using a number of target antigens, against which multiple unique scFv sequences with dissociation constants in the nanomolar range were isolated.",

However, in most cases the hypervariable loops were rebuilt. \n\nThe CDR loop residues selected for refinement were either based on the Chothia 18-20 (targets Ab01, Ab02, Ab03, Ab07, Ab09, Ab10, Ab11) or IMGT 17 CDR definitions (Ab04, Ab05, Ab06, Ab08).

Ion coordination may stabilize otherwise unfavorable conformations from equilibrium and increase potential for polyspecificity via the resulting paratopes. Indeed, iodide-influenced antibody paratopes have been shown to retain activity (40), multiple Ca 2+ -dependent antibodies have been characterized (41)(42)(43), and several studies have shown that exposing pools of IgG to Fe 2+ or heme greatly expand antibody polyreactivity (35,(44)(45)(46)(47). The ability of an antibody to utilize cofactors to bind unique antigens, either by direct cofactor-antigen contact or by cofactor stabilization of otherwise unfavorable conformations, represents an even further expansion of antibody recognition potential beyond that available through sequence and conformational diversity. \n\nFv environment effects CDR H3 conformational equilibrium S25-2 and S25-39 have only 10-amino acid differences between them, with four in each of the light and heavy chain V-gene framework regions, one at the tip of CDR H2, and one at position H101 encoded by the J gene at the base of CDR H3 (Table S1 and Fig. S18). Although the two antibodies utilize nearly identical CDR H3 conformations to bind Kdo antigens, they have not been observed in any of the same unliganded conformations. In the Kdo-bound conformation, Ser H101 of S25-2 makes hydrogen bonds to Arg H94 and Arg H100B within CDR H3 that the germline Ala H101 of S25-39 does not (Table S1 and Fig. S19).

The composition of the CDR loops may have a significant influence on the antibody aggregation propensity. This is important to take into consideration when creating diversity for synthetic libraries as the natural selection in the immune cells is absent and the risk of aggregation of antibody clones might thus be increased. Propensities for aggregation were taken into account in the design of the CDR2 diversity, based on previously published work of the amino acid composition in CDR2 [6]. Generally the use of the most hydrophobic amino acids (i.e. V, I, L, M, and F) was kept at a moderate to low level (with a 0-25% likelihood of a hydrophobic amino acid at any given randomized position). This was done to lower the overall hydrophobicity of the CDRs thereby reducing the risk of aggregation [6], while at the same time allowing hydrophobic contributions to the antigen binding. Additional favorable contributions to binding, documented for tyrosine, serine and glycine, were taken into account in the design of both the CDR2 and CDR3 [40]. Positively charged amino acids were omitted or kept at very low frequencies for CDR2 and CDR3 respectively, as a high frequency of these have been linked to promotion of poly-reactivity (lack of specificity) and increased nucleic acid binding of the antibodies [16,40]. The CDR2 was designed to have a low diversity by limited randomization of only four positions (Figure 3). This entails that the overall diversity is minimized, thus ensuring that the total library diversity can be sampled in the phage display system. The choice of amino acids and their frequencies in the randomized positions were based on refolding studies of dAbs [6]. Due to the genetic rearrangements underlying the natural immune repertoire it is the CDR3 loop in the antibody repertoire which displays the highest diversity. Therefore the CDR3 loop in Predator library was designed to take this into account by randomizing seven positions.",

            "text": "Comparison of seven high resolution x-ray structures shows that the conformations of canonical complementarity determining region (CDR) loops, which are shared by these antibodies, are very similar. However, large spatial displacements (up to 2.7 \u00c5) of the essentially identical CDR loops become evident when the antibody \u2424-sheet frameworks, to which the loops are attached, are least-squares superposed. The loop displacements follow, and amplify, small positional differences in framework/loop splice points. Intradomain structural variability and, to a lesser extent, domain-domain orientation appear to cause the observed loop divergences. The results suggest that the selection of framework regions for loop grafting procedures is more critical than previously thought. \n\nImmunoglobulin variable domains, VL 1 and VH, associate noncovalently to form the Fv, a dimer of antiparallel, eightstranded \u2424-sandwiches (1,2). The VL and VH \u2424-sheets from different antibodies are nearly identical in three dimensions. However, the six complementarity determining region (CDR) loops (L1-L3, H1-H3), which connect the \u2424-strands of the conserved framework and encode antigenic specificities, are much more variable in both sequence and conformation (2, 3). Chothia, Lesk, and colleagues (4, 5) identified sets of similar \"canonical\" conformations for all CDR loops except H3. Between 50 and 95% of antibody sequences are consistent with the classified canonical conformations (4), which are determined by conserved interactions of only a few key residues (\"structural determinants\") within the loop and/or the framework regions. Some differences in the position of canonical CDR loops relative to superposed framework regions by comparing x-ray structures (4) or x-ray and modeled structures (5) were previously observed. However, these effects were observed in structures determined at medium resolution, generally considered minor (4, 5), and not systematically explored. \n\nWe have compared, via least-squares superpositions, the Fvs of seven x-ray structures refined to high resolution (better than 2 \u00c5) available in the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (6).",

Instead, we took advantage of the notion that the length of CDRs significantly influences the shape of the paratope 42 . Therefore, we analyzed the length of each CDR in the neutralizing antibodies. Interestingly, CDR-L1, L3, and H3 in the site III antibodies were shorter than those in site I/II antibodies (Fig. 7 and Supplementary Fig. 4). Specifically, the shorter CDR-L1 and L3 lengths were attributed to the preferential use of the kappa light chain in the site III antibodies; 79% (27/34) of these antibodies were paired with kappa light chain, while only 23% (3/13) and 44% (7/16) of the site I and II antibodies used kappa light chain, respectively.

            "text": "This study presents a structural and dynamic characterization of a phage germline library, by investigating the effect of different heavy and light chain pairings on the antibody paratope and the V H -V L interface distributions. We provide a new understanding of the antibody paratope and show that both sidechain and backbone CDR conformations can vary depending on the paired heavy or light chain. Antibody CDR loops are flexible and can adopt various distinct conformations in solution (15). Recent studies also revealed that various biophysical properties of antibodies are governed by their conformational diversity (14,31,(69)(70)(71). To capture this high flexibility and diversity of the CDR loops, they need to be described as conformational ensembles in solution (18). For all CDR loops conformational transitions between different canonical clusters and additional dominant solution structures have been observed. In previous simulation studies these conformational transitions between different CDR loop conformations have been shown to occur in the micro-to-millisecond timescale (15,18). Figures 1, 2 are in perfect agreement with these findings and emphasize that one single static structure is not sufficient to capture the high conformational variability of the CDR loops. SI Figures S1-S35 show very similar findings and consistently show pairing specific CDR loop conformations and differently favored canonical cluster structures. The pink dot projected into the free energy surfaces represents the starting X-ray structure. However, the structure characterizing an antibody the best is the dominant conformation in solution, which not necessarily coincides with the apo X-ray structure. Especially, since the apo crystal structure can be distorted by crystal packing effects. Additionally, we show that even identical sequences can adopt different germline-specific conformations depending on the type of paired heavy and light chain, respectively. This is especially interesting for the CDR-H1 and CDR-H2 loop, as these loops are not directly interfacial with the paired light chain, however, their conformational variability is still affected. The reason for that is the strong structural correlation between the CDR-H3 and the CDR-H1 loop.",

            "text": "These deviations from the other variants can also be seen to some extent in VH:VL orientation parameters in Table S2, as well as in the smaller number of residues involved in the VH:VL interfaces of these 2 variants (Fig. S5). These differences undoubtedly influence the conformation of the CDRs, in particular CDR H1 (Fig. 1A) and CDR L1 (Fig. 3C), especially with the tandem glycines and multiple serines present, respectively. \n\nPairing of different germlines yields antibodies with various degrees of stability. As indicated by the melting temperatures, germlines H1-69 and H3-23 for HC and germline L1-39 for LC produce more stable Fabs compared to the other germlines in the experimental set. Structural determinants of the differential stability are not always easy to decipher. One possible explanation of the clear preference of LC germline L1-39 is that CDR L3 has smaller residues at positions 91 and 94, allowing for more room to accommodate CDR H3. Other germlines have bulky residues, Tyr, Arg and Trp, at these positions, whereas L1-39 has Ser and Thr. Various combinations of germline sequences for VL and VH impose certain constraints on CDR H3, which has to adapt to the environment. A more compact CDR L3 may be beneficial in this situation. \n\nAt the other end of the stability range is LC germline L3-20, which yields antibodies with the lowest T m s. While pairings with H3-53 and H5-51 may be safely called a mismatch, those with H1-69 and H3-23 have T m s about 5-6 higher. Curiously, the 2 Fabs, H1-69:L3-20 and H3-23:L3-20, deviate markedly in their tilt angles from the rest of the panel. It is possible that by adopting extreme tilt angles the structure modulates CDR H3 and its environment, which apparently cannot be achieved solely by conformational rearrangement of the CDR.",

In contrast to two published reports of optimization of antibodies to the femtomolar affinity range, 3,4 we chose soluble Fab (fragment antigen-binding) expression of our library variants, well-based screening for selection and limited our library diversification to complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) only. In addition, we compare our results to a study that applied yeast display and extensive library generation approaches to the same antibody and optimization parameters, namely, the antibody adalimumab. \n\nAdalimumab (Humira \u00ae ), 10 binds the inflammatory mediator, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), with ~100 pM affinity. 11 While it has not been demonstrated that increased affinity would increase the therapeutic efficacy of adalimumab, the molecule has already been affinity-matured and thus serves as a good starting point for studying the engineering of very tight binding by different methods.",

            "text": "This reflects the fact that the light chain repertoire used in the chain shuffling was from a synthetic scFv library with a single scaffold and diversified CDRs [25] and implies that a single variable domain framework can accommodate CDRs of different germline family origins. The CDR-L1, L2, and L3 of the B4L-E2 variant were from the VL3, VL1, and VL3 families, respectively, compared to VL1, VL3, and VL1, respectively for the parental B4. The light chain CDRs of the B4 variants showed no significant similarity to the parental sequences, in contrast to the affinity-matured variants typically obtained by other approaches such as focused CDR randomization [36] or error-prone PCR [37], which tend to yield similar CDR sequences. \n\nOf the six D11 variants obtained by CDR-H3 randomization, three were from NNK randomization of residues H97-98 (Kabat numbering), and one each was from the randomization of residues H98-99, H99-100, or H100-101. Randomization of residues H95 and H96 did not yield any OSCAR binders, which suggests that these residues are critical for the binding of D11 to OSCAR. Interestingly, the CDR-H3s of the variant clones obtained from the randomization of residues H98-99, H99-100, and H100-101 (D11-B9, D11-F8, and D11-C10, respectively) were shorter than the CDR-H3 of the parental clone by one or two amino acids (Table 2). This was presumably caused by oligonucleotide synthesis errors. The isolation of these rare deletion mutants suggests that varying CDR length, as well as CDR sequence, can promote in vitro antibody affinity maturation.",

The diversity of the CDR-H3 comes from the recombination of three germline genes: IGHV, IGHD, and IGHJ (Tonegawa, 1983), imprecise recombination of these genes, i.e., junctional diversity (Alt and Baltimore, 1982), the possibility of using three reading frames for translation of the IGHD gene (Sanz, 1991), and further diversification during somatic hypermutation process (see below). \n\nHuman CDR-H3 loops have an average length of 15.2 (\u00b14.1) residues (IMGT CDR definition) (Zemlin et al., 2003), with a range of lengths between 1-35 residues, and a length distribution resembling a Gaussian process. While extensive analysis of antibody structures has identified sequence patterns to predict the conformation of the residues at the base of the CDR-H3 (Shirai et al., 1996;Morea et al., 1998), the enormous variability in amino acid sequence and length of this loop, as well as its flexibility, has precluded delineation of rules for predicting its overall conformation. Thus, structural modeling of CDR-H3 is still challenging (Almagro et al., 2011), using either comparative methods that rely on templates chosen based on sequence homology, or knowledge-based methods such as the canonical structure model.",

            "text": "Phage display has proven to be an unequivocal success for antibody discovery, evidenced by 17 approved mAbs and an increasing number of phage-derived antibodies under clinical investigation. As an entirely in vitro technology, phage display not only compensates for many limitations inherited by in vivo antibody discovery approaches, it also provides a highly versatile and customizable platform that continuously evolves to meet distinct development goals.\n\nAffinity is a key factor used to evaluate the quality of a phage library. It has been observed that affinity that can be achieved is correlated with the library size. We investigated the correlation between highest affinity values obtained from published universal phage libraries and library size (data not shown). In agreement with previous observations, there is a positive correlation between the two parameters. This is because a universal library is designed for antibody discovery against any given target. Therefore, a larger library (higher diversity) offers a greater chance of identifying high affinity antibodies. In the case of a synthetic library, although a limited number of frameworks are used, the designed CDR diversity usually far exceeds the natural CDR diversity. Therefore, the chance to obtain high affinity antibodies mainly depends on CDR sequence diversity. In the case of a na\u00efve library, the library diversity comes from not only the sequence diversity, but also from light and heavy chain rearrangement. Of note, the random heavy and light chain rearrangement is a process highly resembling chain shuffling, which is a routine strategy for in vitro antibody affinity maturation. This may explain why antibodies with very high affinity were isolated from na\u00efve phage libraries, even when the libraries were constructed from germline sequences with no or very limited somatic hypermutations. While it was expected that identification of library size is a key factor that determines the affinity, a correlation with either library type or library generation was not observed (data not shown). One reason is that, except for a few early libraries, the library size difference among three generations of phage libraries is minimal. Also, the advancements of three generations of phage libraries mainly reflects improvements of overall developability properties.\n\nIt has been reported that the presence of library clones that do not display antibody fragments (bald phage) is partially due to stop codons or frameshifts present in the antibody gene. These clones often outgrow because of the decreased burden on production of",

            "text": "Proper characterization of the CDR loops, especially the loops which are mainly involved in the binding process, is crucial to understand protein-protein interactions and antigen binding. Various studies focused on classifying the CDR loops according to their loop length and sequence composition based on strong experimental structural information (6,8,27). We used this experimental support to characterize the CDR-L3 loop ensemble in solution. Four different antibodies with distinct CDR-loop lengths, sequence compositions and types of light chains were used to identify functional solution structures within this ensemble of pre-existing conformations. Figure 1 shows the results of the hierarchical clustering of the first analyzed antibody with the most prominent CDR-L3 loop length of nine residues and displays a high conformational diversity with various transitions between the four observed clusters. Comparison of this result with the six available  canonical cluster median crystal structures clearly showed that within one simulated cluster we were able to sample several canonical cluster representatives. Within the highest populated simulated cluster, the assigned canonical cluster representative of L3-9-cis7-1 (cluster median 1J1P) was present. Taking the crystal structure populations into account the L3-9-cis7-1 is the most abundant canonical cluster for all CDR-L3 loop lengths. To compare the populations observed in the PDB with our conformational ensemble in solution we calculated a Markovstate model of the CDR-L3 loop (Figure 2) and found two additional canonical cluster representatives close to the same global minimum of the L3-9-cis7-1 median. The representative of the L3-9-cis7-2 canonical cluster (cluster median 1G7I) is situated in another local side-minimum and displays transition kinetics to the most probable macrostate in the microsecond timescale. Astonishingly, we were also able to sample the transition to the canonical cluster representative of the L3-9-cis7-3 cluster (cluster median 1L7I) in the high micro-tomillisecond timescale. Besides the sampling of conformational transitions between different available canonical clusters we identified an additional macrostate representative which could be an important conformation in solution. The second antibody analyzed has a CDR-L3 loop length of eight residues.",

            "text": "Antibodies, vital proteins with an inherent Y-shaped structure in the immune system, are produced in response to an immunological challenge. Their primary function is to discern and neutralize specific pathogens, typically referred to as antigens, with a significant degree of specificity [39]. The specificity mainly comes from the Complementarity Determining Regions (CDRs), which accounts for most binding affinity to specific antigens [24,15,49,2]. Hence, the design of CDRs is a crucial step in developing potent therapeutic antibodies, which plays an important role in drug discovery. \n\nTraditional in silico antibody design methods rely on sampling or searching protein sequences over a large search space to optimize the physical and chemical energy, which is inefficient and easily trapped in bad local minima [1,31,47]. Recently, deep generative models have been employed to model protein sequences in nature for antibody design [5,17]. Following the fundamental biological principle that structure determines function numerous efforts have been focused on antibody sequence-structure co-design [22,21,36,29,30,37], which demonstrate superiority over sequence design-based methods. \n\nFigure 1: The third CDR in the heavy chain, CDR-H3 (colored in yellow), of real antibody (left) and synthetic antibody (right) designed by MEAN [29] for a given antigen (PDB ID: 4cmh). The rest parts of antibodies except CDR-H3 are colored in blue. The antigens are colored in gray. We use red (resp. black) dotted lines to represent clashes between a CDR-H3 atom and a framework/antigen atom (resp. another CDR-H3 atom). We consider a clash occurs when the overlap of the van der Waals radii of two atoms exceeds 0.6\u00c5. However, the main evaluation metrics in the aforementioned works are amino acid recovery (AAR) and root mean square deviation (RMSD) between the generated antibody and the real one. This is controversial because AAR is susceptible to manipulation and does not precisely gauge the quality of the generated antibody sequence. Meanwhile, RMSD does not involve side chains, which are vital for antigen-antibody interaction.",

Importantly, CDR-H3 sequence diversity as defined by the ratio of the number of different sequences divided by the total number of sequences was greater than 97%. Of note, sequence analysis of about 2,000 clones from the initial \"Slonomics\" CDR-H3 library and of more than 4,000 clones of the final library by Sanger sequencing has not revealed any detectable redundancy (data not shown). This observation is leading to the suggestion that the major portion of the observed replicates originates most likely from an amplification bias introduced during the 454 workflow. \n\nFor framework distribution analysis the frequencies of each VH, V\u03ba and V\u03bb framework were compiled from sequences (> 90 bp) that could be unambiguously assigned to specific frameworks. For VH, V\u03ba and V\u03bb 130,983, 94,232 and 99,871 sequences, respectively were evaluated. The VH (Fig. 12A), V\u03ba (Fig. 12B) and V\u03bb (Fig. 12C) framework frequencies were found to the portions as expected by the design indicating an unbiased cloning performance during the construction of the Ylanthia library. \n\nAntibody selections. Phage preparations for each sub-library were performed as outlined in the materials and methods section and phage titers and relative Fab display rates were determined by UV-spectroscopy and ELISA, respectively (data not shown). Antibody phage selections ('pannings') were performed according to standard protocols. 54,55 The following different protein antigens were used to perform phage selections: recombinant human (rh) ErbB4, rhFZD4/Fc, rhTNFalpha, M-CSF, eGFP, a human IgG1 antibody (with the goal to generate anti-idiotypic antibodies) and three other antigens. After three rounds of pannings, the enriched Fab encoding sequences were subcloned as pools into the pYBex10 Fab expression vector.",

As shown in Table 2, many sites in the CDRs appeared to be substitutable since there was little effect on binding to either genotype from replacement with an alanine residue. A few CDR residues, for example CDR-H3 Y100c, showed a large reduction in binding to both genotype E2s when replaced with alanine. Notably, alanine substitution of CDR-H3 residue Tyr98 produced a differential effect with larger loss in binding for genotype 1b than for genotype 1a, E2 protein. A few of the substitutable positions were selected for replacement with charged residues because these sites are not in contact with an epitope peptide in the co-crystal structure, 10 are solvent accessible polar or charged residues, and varied residues are found at these positions in human germline genes. Residues CDR-L1 Asn27d, CDR-L3 Glu93, and CDR-H2 Gln61were chosen for replacement with Asp, Arg, and Lys, respectively. These sites are not in contact with peptide in the structure (Fig. 3A) of the hu5B3.k1VH3.v3: E2 412-423 peptide complex. \n\nFurther sites of charge residue substitution were identified during the process of affinity maturation of hu5B3.kIVH3.v1 using phage display technology. A cluster of residues forming one end of the peptide binding pocket (Fig. 3B) were targeted for combinatorial mutagenesis. A library containing variants of residues VL-Y28, I30, F32, S91, Y96, and VH-Y98, Y99, K100a, Y100c was constructed.",

            "text": "This review has considered the phage display of Fabs, scFvs and nanobodies. With potential application to all recombinant antibody library types are the recent improvement in library design and display efficiency. The diversity within the CDR regions can now be designed with considerable accuracy by using trimer phosphoramidine codons to mimic natural amino acid usage [52]. Furthermore, improvements have been made in reducing cloning errors due to the presence of linker repeat regions [49]. Both advances will facilitate the optimal cloning of diversity into libraries in the future. The co-expression of chaperones and isomerases [34,36] as well as the use of the co-translation secretion pathway with optimised signal sequences [25] can significantly improve antibody phage display efficiency, thereby improving the efficiency of isolating binders. These same strategies also improve soluble antibody expression levels. Furthermore, the identification and use of highly stable Fabs and scFvs as scaffold for the introduction of synthetic diversity have improved expression and stability of the resulting antibody fragments [31,32,50,66]. The combined use of these strategies to yield higher expression levels and increased stability has the potential to produce more efficient phage display of antibodies and therefore improve panning efficacy. They should also produce more useful reagents. \n\nMethods suitable for the batch reformatting of both Fabs and scFvs into IgGs for high-level expression in mammalian cell culture are now also described [26,27,58,59]. These will facilitate the efficient cloning of sub-libraries of antibody fragments from panning experiments to allow them to be screened as IgGs. This has previously been a bottleneck in developing therapeutics from phage display libraries, as the monovalent recombinant antibody fragments often have very different properties to their concomitant divalent IgGs. \n\nNanobodies from both camelids and sharks are readily amenable to the production of simple, high diversity phage display libraries [18,19]. They provide small antibodies with very high stability, therefore potentially offering unique properties for diagnostic or even therapeutic applications.",

For COP-3 chain L, the surface groove is depressed due to less N-terminal length, so while CDR-L1 and CDR-L3 reside in the same groove, CDR-L1 appears to interact less with cCpE. The conformation of CDR-H3 may force this CDR-L1 change in COP-3. With PDBePISA, we calculated interface surface areas between the L chain of COPs and cCpE and found that COP-2's area was 36% larger. In both COP's chain H, the CDR-H1 and CDR-H2 bind on one side of cCpE's \u03b25-\u03b26 element while CDR-H3 flanks the other (Fig. 5C). While CDR-H1 and CDR-H2 have similar conformations and sequence alignments show that residue conservation is high, CDR-H3 conformations appear to vary and residue conservation is low (SI Fig. S1). Generally, the three CDR conformations overlay well between both COPs, which is reflected by cCpE/H chain interface surface area differences of only 5%. For both COPs, 80% of the total cCpE/COP interface area resides in chain H. Overall, COP-2 appears to use chain L to a higher degree than COP-3,  while both COPs use chain H similarly and dominantly to bind cCpE. Moreover, the surface structure of cCpE appears to be altered more by COP-2 than COP-3, indicating that COPspecific interactions may uniquely mold cCpE's surface due to sequence diversity (Fig. 5, B and C). We next determined if these structural features could explain the differences in binding equilibria between COP-2 and COP-3 found in vitro.",

This knowledge could be leveraged to study immune system disorders, including immunosenescence, where distortions in the conserved public pattern of CDR-H3 cluster usage in antigen-unexperienced BCR repertoires could signal disease states. Furthermore, the knowledge of over-represented CDR-H3 clusters in na\u00efve BCR repertoires could be applied in rational phage display library engineering, with Structural Stem cluster sequences used as starting points for library diversity generation. \n\nRecently, transgenic mouse models with human adaptive immune system have been created to raise \"naturally human\" antibodies in non-human systems [35]. However, their BCR repertoires are shaped inside the murine environment, which could potentially select for BCR paratopes non-native to the human body. Hence, our structural diversity analysis could also be employed in the paratope \"humanness\" assessment of BCR repertoires derived from transgenic animals.",

            "text": "The antigen-binding sites of antibodies are formed by six loops, three each from the variable domains of the light chain (VL) and of the heavy chain (VH). These \"complementarity-determining regions\" or CDRs 1 are hypervariable in sequence, however, five of them assume a limited number of main-chain conformations, called \"canonical structures.\" 2 These conformations are determined by the CDR length and by the presence of key amino acid residues at specific positions either within the CDRs or in the framework regions. The specific pattern of residues that determines each canonical structure forms a \"signature\" whereby a canonical structure can be recognized in the sequence of an immunoglobulin of unknown structure and can, therefore, be predicted from sequence alone. 3 CDR-L3 connects two C-terminal b-strands of the VL domain and forms a wide loop anchored at positions 90 and 97, which are part of the b-scaffold [Fig. 1(A)]. CDR-L3 typically contains nine residues between the invariant residues Cys88 and Phe98 with a cis-proline occupying position 95. Due to junctional diversity in V-J recombination, a significant fraction of antibodies contains only eight residues in CDR-L3. Structurally, the deletion occurs at position 95 resulting in the sequences either without Pro, or with a Pro at positions 94 or 96. \n\nThe 8-residue CDR-L3 canonical structures were systematically classified in 2009, 4 when 14 crystal structures were assigned to four types: 3A, 3B, 6, and 7. Two types, 3A and 7, contained only two members each and could hardly be called \"canonical,\" but the new structures determined since then proved it to be correct. \n\nIn the most recent and comprehensive classification, 5 19 nonredundant structures with the 8-residue CDR-L3 were grouped into three clusters on the basis of the backbone dihedral angles u and w. Two clusters, L3-8-1 and L3-8-cis6, were clearly defined with an average u/w deviation from the median structure of only 10 .",

            "text": "The strategic development of nanobodies utilizing CDRs sourced from pre-existing antibodies would be immensely valuable in circumventing animal immunizations and directly producing binders within the desired framework. However, the creation of nanobody grafts utilizing CDRs derived from conventional antibodies necessitates meticulous consideration, as both heavy and light chain variable domains (VH and VL) form the antigen-binding site and are integral to recognizing the antigenic epitope [20]. Additionally, the framework plays a crucial role in determining CDR conformation and orientation, with specific framework residues often directly contributing to antigen binding. Thus, it is imperative to always take into account framework residues when designing a graft [20]. \n\nIn order to overcome the challenge of needing extensive libraries and intricate selection procedures, Hanna et al. suggest a two-step method for generating Nbs (Fig. 1) [20]. First, we transplant complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) from traditional antibody formats onto Nb frameworks, resulting in weak antigen binders. Then, these suboptimal binders serve as templates for the construction of targeted synthetic phage libraries to improve affinity [20]. \n\nOur opinion is that this methodology serves as a fitting supplement to immune, na\u00efve, and synthetic libraries in the production of protein and hapten binders. It is advantageous that the vast quantity of pre-existing antibodies offers an extensive collection of CDRs that can be utilized in the construction of targeted synthetic VHH libraries. These techniques, which expedite the creation of VHH possessing desired specificities and frameworks, are highly beneficial for advancing nanobody-based research and enhancing the therapeutic potential of VHH-based treatments [20].",

Our L2 definition is 3 residues longer than the Chothia definition on the C-terminus and our L2 definition is 2 residues longer on each end of the CDR. \n\nWe built a homology model of the C10 scFv, consisting of a human IGHV1-69 domain and of a likely human IGLV3-19/ IGLV1-44 fusion product, and for the C10 VL-CDRs grafted onto an IGKV3-20 framework (referred to as C10KV3). The C10 mutations giving rise to P2224, which are predominantly located in the VH1 heavy chain, were added to the models of C10 and C10KV3 to produce models of P2224 and P2224KV3, respectively. Seeking to minimize the number of templates used in our C10 homology model, for framework and CDRs were not selected sequentially, but were considered simultaneously because we aimed to select framework templates that already contain CDRs in the correct conformations. We focused on CDRs H1 and L1 first, in conjunction with the framework choice. CDRs L2 and H2 were modeled directly on their donor framework loops as these loops in many cases preserve a common backbone structure and only display sequence variability.",

We found that torafugu use between 70 and 82% of all possible V (variable), D (diversity), and J (joining) gene segment combinations and that they share a similar frequency distribution of these VDJ combinations. The CDR-H3 sequence repertoire observed in individuals is biased with the preferential use of a small number of VDJ, dominated by sequences containing inserted nucleotides. We uncovered the common CDR-H3 amino-acid (aa) sequences shared by individuals. Common CDR-H3 sequences feature highly convergent nucleic-acid recombination compared with private ones. Finally, we observed differences in repertoires between IgM and IgT, including the unequal usage frequencies of V gene segment and the biased number of nucleotide insertion/deletion at VDJ junction regions that leads to distinct distributions of CDR-H3 lengths.",

            "text": "Antibodies are one of primary effector molecules of the human immune system and bind their target antigen through their complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) displayed on the Fab (antigen-binding fragment) portion of the antibody (Fig. 1). The CDRs encode unique structural diversity and provide antibodies with the ability to recognize a wide variety of targets. The protective efficacy of an antibody can be achieved through binding alone if it results in neutralization of a function of the target or may require additional immune functions provided by the Fc (crystallizable fragment) portion of the antibody molecule with receptors found on immune cells or complement proteins in serum. Antibody Fc region functionality can trigger or augment a number of different host defence mechanisms including phagocytosis, release of cytotoxic or immunomodulatory biomolecules and the complement cascade and formation of the membrane attack complex. These properties potentially make antibodies extremely potent molecules for therapy and they have been developed into an important class of drugs for the treatment of numerous cancers, autoimmune and infectious diseases (1). \n\nDisplay of properly folded proteins on phage through fusion with phage coat proteins was initially conceived as a means to identify the sequence of the protein target which binds to an antibody (2). Ironically, one of the most common uses of phage display today, almost 30 years after its initially development, is to discover antibodies against selected protein targets. Originally developed by Greg Winter et al. at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology and Richard Lerner, Carlos Barbas et al. at Scripps Research institute, the basic concept that a vast antibody repertoire could be displayed on phage with their genetic sequences packaged within has allowed for the robust screening of a variety of target antigens and rapid recovery of specific antibody sequences for recombinant expression (3)(4)(5). \n\nToday, a wide variety of antibody phage display libraries exist, with the antibodies displayed either as Fabs, scFvs (single-chain variable fragments) or sdAbs (single-domain antibodies) in fusion with typically the gene III coat protein (6,7) (Fig. 1).",

            "text": "As for the CDR-H3 loop no canonical clusters could be assigned, we projected the available 16 X-ray structures into the tICA space, which already reveal a high conformational diversity. The majority of these 16 Fab crystal structures are present within the obtained CDR-H3 loop ensembles in solution and additional pairing specific CDR-H3 loop solution structures can be observed. The results presented in Figure 1 clearly show a strong correlation between the three heavy chain CDR loops and reveal a strong dependency of the V H -CDR loop ensembles on the respective light chain pairing. \n\nOn the other hand, Figure 2 depicts the direct comparison of all V L -CDR loop ensembles containing the L1-39 germline (5I15, 5I19, 5I1E and 4KMT). The free energy surfaces of the CDR-L1 loop projected into the same coordinate system clearly show a strong influence of paired heavy chains. While the two antibodies H1-69:L1-39 and H3-23:L1-39 (5I15 and 5I19) with the highest experimentally determined melting temperatures (SI Table S1) are mainly restricted to one dominant minimum in solution, H3-53:L1-39 and H5-51:L1-39 (5I1E and 4KMT) reveal a substantially higher flexibility, which is also reflected in the higher number of clusters (SI Table S2). Apart from the presented free energy surfaces, we quantified flexibility by clustering on the individual CDR loops and aligning on the respective heavy or light chain. For the clustering we used the average linkage clustering algorithm and applied a RMSD distance cut-off criterion of 2.5 \u00c5 for all heavy chain CDR loops and a RMSD distance cut-off criterion of 1.5 \u00c5 for all light chain CDR loops (Table S2). Three canonical clusters exist for the CDR-L1 loop with a loop length of 11 residues (L1-11). Two of these three canonical clusters contain k light chain antibodies (L1-11-1, L1-11-2), while the third is composed of mainly l light chain antibodies (L1-11-3) (10,11).",

            "text": "The clones with most affinity improvement came from the CDR-L3 library. It is probable that the CDR-H3 of hz1E11 is already close to optimal and most mutations, especially in the region 97 H -100 H , are deleterious to the binding affinity, while the CDR-L3 sequence is not as optimal and the mutation in this region can result in significant improvement in the affinity. The L-NNK library panning outputs were enriched with clones with a hydrophobic amino acid at the position 91 L , a small amino acid at 92 L , and an aromatic amino acid at 93 L . This pattern is somewhat different from the parental CDR-L3 sequence of Q 89L QLYSTPWT 97L and again suggests that the CDR-L3 sequence of the parental 1E11 antibody was sub-optimal and thus had room for affinity improvement. \n\nThe clones with most improvement in affinity, 1A12 and 1F11, came from the highstringency panning of the CDR-L3 NNK library, although 1F11 was also found from the lowstringency panning of the same library (Table 2). Compared to the low-stringency panning in which 100% of the second-, third-, and fourth-round output clones screened were ELISA positive, for the high-stringency panning the fourth-round output yielded no binder at all, and only one-third of the third-round output clones were ELISA positive (Table 1). It is likely that the extremely antigen-limiting condition favored clones with higher affinity. However, at the same time, the basal level of non-specific binding of phage particles became more evident, and even dominated the panning output. In agreement with this argument, sequence analysis of the ELISA positive clones showed that the high-stringency panning resulted in the convergence of the output clones to a small number of sequences, while the sequences were more divergent for the output clones from the low-stringency panning. For the CDR-H3 libraries, the overall pattern of the panning output titer and the ratio of ELISA positive clones were similar to that of the CDR-L3 libraries; i.e. higher panning stringency had a negative effect on both parameters.",

            "text": "The heavy and light chains are composed of structural domains that have \u00bb110 amino acid residues. These domains have a common folding pattern often referred to as the \"immunoglobulin fold,\" formed by the packing together of 2 anti-parallel b-sheets. All immunoglobulin chains have an N-terminal V domain followed by 1 to 4 C domains, depending upon the chain type. In antibodies, the heavy and light chain V domains pack together forming the antigen combining site. This site, which interacts with the antigen (or target), is the focus of current antibody modeling efforts. This interaction site is composed of 6 complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) that were identified in early antibody amino acid sequence analyses to be hypervariable in nature, 2 and thus are responsible for the sequence and structural diversity of our antibody repertoire. \n\nThe sequence diversity of the CDR regions presents a substantial challenge to antibody modeling. 4] A CDR canonical structure is defined by its length and conserved residues located in the hypervariable loop and framework residues (V-region residues that are not part of the CDRs). Furthermore, studies of antibody sequences revealed that the total number of canonical structures are limited for each CDR, [5][6][7] indicating possibly that antigen recognition may be affected by structural restrictions at the antigen-binding site. Later studies found that the CDR loop length is the primary determining factor of antigen-binding site topography because it is the primary factor for determining a canonical structure. 8,9 dditional efforts have led to our current understanding that the LC CDRs L1, L2, and L3 have preferred sets of canonical structures based on length and amino acid sequence composition. This was also found to be the case for the H1 and H2 CDRs. 8 Classification schemes for the canonical structures of these 5 CDRs have emerged and evolved as the number of depositions in the Protein Data Bank 10 of Fab fragments of antibodies grow. 8,11 Recently, a comprehensive CDR classification scheme was reported identifying 72 clusters of conformations observed in antibody structures. 12,13 The knowledge and predictability of these CDR canonical structures have greatly advanced antibody modeling efforts.",

Of the 4.52 million total qualified sequences obtained from the five CDRs, 4.47 million sequences (99.1%) were functional and 3.66 million sequences (80.9%) were correct.However, only 1.34 x 10 5 CDR variants were observed, indicating that the selection remarkably reduced the library diversity.Among these CDR variants, 1.24 x 10 5 were functional variants (92.1%) and 6.08 x 10 4 were correct variants (45.3%), but only 1.8 x 10 4 variants were present as a single copy.Accordingly, these variants can be translated into 8.74 x 10 4 functional peptides and 5.39 x 10 4 correct peptides.These results suggest that the selection efficiently removed the majority of non-functional sequences at both the DNA and protein levels.\n\nComparison of sequence abundances before and after selection revealed that a subset of CDR sequences was enriched at high frequencies (Fig 5).Several hundreds of CDR variants were identified in over 1000 copies, which accounted for >60% of all sequences in the selected L1, L3, H1 and H2 libraries.In addition, the top 10 most frequent peptide mutants were present in 4.2 x 10 3 -1.1 x 10 5 copies (S4 Table ).These mutants accounted for 37.2%, 27.3%, 71.6% and 45.3% of all sequences in the selected L1, L3, H1 and H2 libraries, respectively.In the selected L1 library, a sequence with a stop codon was abnormally enriched.The stop codon should be introduced due to errors from degenerate oligonucleotide synthesis on microchips and the followed amplification.The enrichment was possible due to that the recombinant phages with this sequence may bind to the antigen non-specifically or support the E.coli hosts to grow faster than other phages.It is surprising that the H3 library displayed a distinct sequence enrichment pattern.The parent H3 gene from the library construction was dramatically enriched after selection, and it accounted for 95.8% of all sequences.",

Most of antibody-antigen interactions performed by the complementarity determining regions (CDRs). Regarding to the size of the antigen, different mixtures of the CDR loops are used for the contact with antigen [11]. Commonly, antibodies directed towards small antigens, such as viruses, the antibody use three complementarities determining regions. However, antibodies  directed towards larger proteins use more than four CDRs. \n\nMAbs are working mostly helped by their fragment chain (Fc), collected of domains C (H2 and H3). Still, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and Abdependent cellular phagocytosis ((ADCC and ADCP) in humans demonstrated the finding of three major classes of Fc Fc\u03bbRI, Fc\u03bbRIIa/c, Fc\u03bb RIIIa, and inhibitory Fc\u03bbRIIb receptors [12]. The FcR and Fc-RI receptors of extracellular regions in humans show significant sequence similarity of 70% -98%. The antibody binding to the components of the complement system is activated with Complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). In addition, the antibodies get their long half-life through active recycling of the neonatal Fc receptor [13]. \n\nScfv is expressed in a variety of hosts, including bacteria, yeast and plants [14]. \n\nSingle-chain fragments have broad applications in medicine and have great potential in biotechnology. The unique and highly specific antigen-binding ability may be exploited to block specific enzymes or bacteria or to detect environmental pollutants present in very low concentrations (biosensors) [15].",

            "text": "In conventional IgG antibodies, the variable fragment contains six hypervariable loops, also called complementary determining loops (CDRs), including three loops in light chains, called CDR-L1, L2, L3, and three loops in heavy chains, called CDR-H1, H2, H3, sustained by highly conserved b-sheet frameworks (52). In order to recognize the specific antigenic regions accurately and specifically, residues usually encoded by up to six different CDR regions, located at the interfaces of VH and VL interfaces, were defined as paratopes, and the corresponding complementary binding sites on the antigen surface were defined as epitopes (Figure 1A) (53). \n\nIn conventional IgG antibodies, the forms of paratopes are usually a cavity, groove, or flat surface, with an epitope of 600-900 \u00c5 (the size also depends on the amino acid composition, the loop size, and the difference of algorithm) (54). The entire structure of IgG antibodies is highly conserved, while the CDR regions, particularly H3 loops, differ extensively not only in terms of sequence but also in structures (52). Undoubtedly, the CDR-H3 loop of traditional IgG antibodies plays an essential role in binding and recognizing epitopes (55). However, as mentioned above, the forms of paratope in conventional antibodies are relatively flat binding surfaces. Thus, it is considered restricted and struggled in binding certain epitopes, like active sites of enzymes, parasite coat proteins, viral canyons, and recessed cryptic epitopes (56-58). On the other hand, given the large size of traditional antibodies, it is almost impossible to achieve tissue penetration, like the blood-brain barrier, or combine with the target epitope using the conventional IgG antibodies (59) (Figures 1B, C). Markedly different from the paratopes of traditional antibodies, the prolate \"rugby ball shaped\" paratope structure of sdAbs forms a distinctly convex surface, increasing the contact frequency of epitopes, making it highly suitable to bind the rigid, concave, clefts, cavities, and restricted epitopes and can access the hydrophobic core of epitope enriched with aromatic residues (60).",

            "text": "The surrogate light chain provides a quality control checkpoint for immunoglobulin heavy chains during development, and importantly, also plays a role in shaping the antibody repertoire through its CDR H3 interactions (9). With the discovery of several unusual antibody structural and genetic features in different species, for example HC-only antibodies in camelids and ultralong CDR H3 antibodies in cows, an understanding of HC-SLC molecular and genetic features in these extreme circumstances may shed light on fundamental mechanisms of repertoire development. CDR H3 length, in particular, is known to impact viral neutralization, with rare long CDR H3s being important in broadly neutralizing anti-HIV antibodies (53, 54). Interestingly, circulating human B cells with pre-BCRs were found to have unusually long, self-reactive, CDR H3 regions (55). Thus, understanding B cell development in the context of HC-SLC interactions has medical implications. The antibody repertoire is shaped by the genome-encoded sequences of its V, D, and J gene segments, their relative usages, junctional diversity factors including terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), and somatic hypermutation mechanisms. The selection step utilizing the SLC is also an important process impacting the expressed antibody repertoire in any given species. In this regard, features of the SLC (including tail lengths, pI, or other molecular properties) or even the usage of alternative SLC components, like multiple VpreB genes, has the potential to significantly alter the repertoire. Therefore, we analyzed several features of SLC components, including (i) the number of VpreB genes, (ii) evolutionary relationships between SLC components, (iii) molecular features of tail lengths, and (iv) correlations between SLC features and repertoire features like CDR H3 length.",

Overall, 13.9 million raw sequences passed the quality filtration steps.The five CDR libraries contained 10.3 million functional sequences (74.4%) with expected lengths, allowing for accurate in-frame reading, and 7.9 million correct sequences (57.0%) perfectly matching to our CDR diversification strategy and degenerate codon design.At the DNA level, the libraries consisted of 5.82 million variants, 3.92 million of which were single copy.In addition, there were 3.37 million functional variants and 1.69 million correct variants.At the protein level, the libraries contained 2.08 million functional peptides and 1.05 million correct peptides.In summary, 42% of the theoretical DNA diversity and 52% of the theoretical peptide diversity were observed in the sequenced libraries.\n\nA detailed analysis of NGS data identified unique characteristics regarding library sequence diversity and redundancy.From the individual CDRs, 59-85% of the observed CDR variants occurred only one time, 14-30% had 2-10 copies, while less than 0.9% had above 10 copies.The map of CDR sequence abundances revealed an overall power-law distribution in which the log 10 counts of total variants of a specific copy number was inversely correlated to the number of copies with differential linear slopes (Fig 2A).These results indicate that the sequences in the L3, H1, H2 and H3 libraries were represented more uniformly than the L1 library.In addition, the map of CDR sequence lengths revealed that 49-74% of total variants were of the correct length, other variants with frameshift mutations mainly occurred due to one nucleotide deletions (19-32%) or insertions (3-5%), and sequences containing two or more  nucleotide changes were present at a much lower abundance (Fig 2B).We speculate that these undesired mutations were introduced mainly due to errors in the microchip-synthesized oligonucleotides.The high-quality of the NGS data also provided the opportunity to calculate the amino acid frequencies within the five CDRs.",

            "text": "The CDR-H3 loop of the idarucizumab antibody in the AGed and AGless conformation is structurally very similar. However, the high conformational diversity of the CDR-H3 loop in this pair of antibodies is reflected in Figure 10. The high number of transitions during the MD simulations and the resulting diverse CDR-H3 loop ensemble underlines the necessity of dynamics and the intrinsically high flexibility of this loop. Figure 11 shows the resulting estimated free energy surface in solution and the low \u00b5s transition timescales illustrate the ability to adopt various conformations present in this pre-existing conformational space. Again, also here the conformational selection paradigm is confirmed. The two chosen idarucizumab Fv structures are in the first stage of specificity refinement for dabigatran, 30 and therefore this high flexibility in the CDR-H3 loop could still allow to bind other antigens. \n\nFor all five of our antibody systems, we show that our protocol sufficiently captures the dynamic and structural properties of the CDR-H3 loop of protein-binding, peptide-binding and hapten-binding antibodies. Our results for all five pairs of antibodies strongly support the conformational selection model and point out challenges of AGless crystal structures for three of the examples. Conformational changes in loops due to crystal contacts have already been reported and show that crystal structures do not always represent the most stable state of a loop in solution. 46,47 Structural changes of the CDR-H3 loop have been observed between the AGed and AGless state due to crystal packing effects. 32,48 Thus, for three of the antibodies we confirm that CDR-H3 loop in crystal structures of antibody Fabs is likely to be influenced by crystal contacts to symmetry mates, and the dominant conformation in solution is actually optimized to bind the antigen. \n\nIn conclusion, the description of the CDR-H3 loop is a hurdle in antibody design and has a huge impact on the antigen binding process. We analyzed pairs of haptenbinding, peptide-binding and protein-binding antibodies with and without structural differences in the CDR-H3 loop in X-ray structures crystallized in complex and without antigen.",

            "text": "Among all the six CDR loops, the V H CDRs, especially V H 's CDR3 (CDRH3), are more frequently involved in the antigen binding than those in the light chain (160,161). The CDRH3 loop, which exists in a variety of different lengths (5-30 amino acids), is of particular importance due to its substantial impact on the canonical conformation and antigen binding compared to the other CDRs (156,(162)(163)(164)(165). Noteworthy, the loop length of CDRH3 does not only affect the specificity and affinity of the antibody for its specific antigen, but also affects the nature of the binding of other CDRs. Specifically, for antibodies with long CDRH3 loops, these loops are responsible for most of the antibody-antigen interactions, while in antibodies with short CDRH3 loops, other CDRs loops usually assist in antigen binding (156). Thus, CDRH3 plays a major role in recognizing diverse targets, and generating interactions with acceptable affinity (166,167). \n\nThe diversity of the V-gene segments can be designed and synthesized artificially by CDRs randomization. These libraries can be fully synthetic or semisynthetic. Synthetic libraries are made to maximize antibodies' functionality by making a large and highly diverse phage repertoire. This is usually achieved in vitro by using PCR and oligonucleotides to create a random integration of the CDRs as well as introduction of different CDRH3 loop sequences and lengths without disrupting the folding of the V regions (94,168). Semisynthetic libraries combine natural and synthetic antibody diversity. They are constructed from non-rearranged Vgenes from pre-B cells, or an antibody framework with randomization of the CDRH3 or several CDRs utilizing degenerated oligonucleotides (128,169,170).",

            "text": "This assessment was done via a sandwich ELISA approach that included immobilization of an anti-Fab antibody in the microtiter plates to capture phage particles followed by incubation with an anti-M13 antibody (HRP conjugated). Again, no difference was observed between pre-and post-packaging, with a very high number of displaying clones in both cases (average of 90% (range from 85% to 94%) displaying clones prepackaging vs. 93% (range from 89% to 97%) displaying clones postpackaging (Figure 3c)). \n\nThese are interesting observations since nonfunctional clones, where the molecule is not expressed, are thought to have a growth advantage over clones containing open-reading frames and expressing antibodies. However, as the two domains of the Fab molecules (VL-CL, VH-CH1) are expressed by two cistrons, loss of functionality in one chain will not prevent the other from being expressed, perhaps limiting potential growth advantages. \n\nFull-length Fab NGS using Pacbio Sequel II revealed no clonal dominance in the library, with the most frequently observed clone representing only ~0.001% of the reads in Lib4A. However, the true frequency is likely less, as we are vastly under-sampling the diversity and this clone had only two reads (Table 2). We also verified the identity of the CDRs in the final library compared to the design and for the presence of liabilities. On average, 94.1% of the CDRs observed in the library matched designed sequences (range from 90.1% to 98.1%) (Table 3). Although non-matching CDRs are expected due to oligonucleotide synthesis and PCR-derived errors, they are always far less abundant than the designed CDRs (Supplementary Figures S2-S6). Since some sequences diverge from design, it is inevitable that sequence liabilities are inadvertently reintroduced. Nonetheless, more than 97% of the naturally replicated CDRs in clones analyzed in all libraries had no sequence liabilities (Figure 4a). Finally, the NovaSeq S4 platform was used to analyze the HCDR3 diversity of the final cloned library.",

According to Figure 9, with the decrease of the threshold, the number of conserved residues gradually increases and becomes stable at 90% threshold, which is expected. In contrast, the RMSD curve shows a surge at 92% threshold. Hence, to balance these two factors, we think it is better to set the threshold between 93% and 96%, where the RMSD remains low and the number of conserved residues is not too small. We further conducted experiments with templates from 90% and 99% threshold, and show the results in Table 7. It is observed that our model is robust with the templates, but still, using 95% as threshold generally achieves more favorable results compared to the other choices. In this work, we generally use CDR-H3 since the interacting residues mainly come from it (Akbar et al., 2021). In practice, we find that using CDR-H3 only is generally sufficient for docking. Also, it is easy to extend the shadow paratope to contain other CDRs by our implementation. We conduct an experiment using both CDR-H3 and CDR-L3 as the shadow paratope for the docking experiment and the results are in Table 8. Additional inclusion of CDR-L3 leads to a slight performance",

            "text": "A fully synthetic human antibody (scFv) library with six diversified complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) was constructed. The detailed procedures for synthetic library construction are described in the Figure S1. Briefly, by following the Kabat definition [18] and using the database of human germline genes (http://www.bioinf.org.uk/abysis), the single chain variable fragment (scFv) was designed to have eight framework regions (FRs) and six CDRs. Regarding the frequency of usage and expression in E. coli, the DP-47 and DPK 22 human germline genes were chosen for the framework region of VH and VL, respectively. For the diversity of each CDR loop, except CDR H3, degenerate oligonucleotides were designed on the basis of the frequency of amino acids for each site in the human germline gene database (Table S3). In the case of CDR H3, much greater diversity in amino acid composition and length was introduced, unlike that in the case of the other CDRs, by using 13 sets of degenerate oligonucleotides with an NNK random sequence and 13 different lengths (10-22 amino acids) (Fig. S1). Each VH and VL gene was assembled by PCR and, to eliminate the clones containing stop codons or frameshifts in the VH or VL gene, each PCR product of VH and VL was cloned into a b-lactamase fusion system. In the selection system, the E. coli clones containing inframe genes of the each chain produced the functional b-lactamase fusion proteins in the periplasm and were selected using ampicillin-containing agar plates [19,20]. After selection, the inframe VH and VL genes were rescued, and the gene sequences were determined by sequencing. Through sequencing experiments, we found that all the clones contained in-frame codons, and no stop codons were observed within the coding genes (data not shown).",

            "abstract": "Monoclonal antibodies are typically characterized by their exquisite specificity toward single antigens, which has been the basis for the successful use of antibodies as targeted therapeutics. There is, however, increasing appreciation for antibody multi\u2010specificity and how it may play a role in the immune responses. As the total number of antibody producing lymphocytes in each individual is finite (10 7\u20139 ) and the varieties of potential foreign antigens is infinite, the ability of one antibody to recognize more than one antigen may expand the effective size of the antibody repertoire and increase the efficiency of antigen recognition. To understand the molecular mechanism of how one antibody may accommodate different antigens, previous studies set out to identify unique binding molecules for antibodies distinct from the cognate antigens by selection from synthetic repertoires of peptides or proteins. Although the affinities of these isolated \u2018antigens\u2019 are generally weak, they demonstrated that one antigen\u2010binding site is capable of distinct interaction (James et al., 2003; Kramer et al., 1997; Sethi et al., 2006). We set out to understand the role of antibody multispecificity from a different angle. We want to discover antibodies that are dual specific against two related antigens with high affinity, so as to reveal the mechanism of the multispecific antibodies that are able to play a functional and physiological role due to the high affinity. We also want to identify a general strategy to generate such antibodies against two defined antigens de novo by evolving a monospecific antibody to bind a second antigen. This may provide an option to therapeutically target two molecules with one antibody, and also provide insight into the propensity and mechanism of adding a distinct binding specificity to a matured antibody and the evolution of binding specificity. We explore whether a mono\u2010specific antibody, HERCEPTIN\u00ae, which binds human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2, ErbB2), can be evolved into one that binds a second binding specificity toward a distinct antigen and maintains its HER2\u2010binding ability. We generated a repertoire of Herceptin antibody variants by mutating in the light chain (LC) complementarity determining regions (CDRs) in a manner that mimic the natural diversity. From this repertoire of Fabs displayed on M13 phage we isolated variants that have 3\u201317 substitution or insertion compared to Herceptin and can bind the new antigens. Some of them maintained HER2 binding and are thus dual specific. The approach is based on the understanding that modifications of the LC sequence can modulate the binding specificity of antibodies. In addition, many antibodies, with Herceptin as a prime example (Cho et al., 2003; Kelley and O9Connell, 1993), bind the antigens by utilizing mainly the heavy chain (HC) CDRs, suggesting that mutations in the LC CDRs might allow preservation of the original antigen\u2010binding specificity. We chose to focus on a dual specific variant of Herceptin bH1 that binds vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in addition to HER2 with dissociation constant (Kd) of 300nM and 26 nM, respectively. Further, bH1 exhibited inhibitory activity in the proliferation of VEGF\u2010stimulated endothelial cells (HUVEC) and HER2 overexpressing BT474 breast cancer cell line, suggesting that bH1 retained the HER2\u2010binding function of Herceptin, and acquired a VEGF\u2010blocking activity. To understand the molecular mechanism of the dual specificity, we solved the crystal structures of bH1 in complex with VEGF (the receptor binding domain, residue 8\u2013109) and HER2 (residue 1\u2013624) at 2.6 anf 2.9 A resolution. The structure of the bH1/HER2 binding domains (bH1 Fv and domain IV of HER2) superimposes onto the Herceptin/HER2 complex with an r.m.s.d of 0.8 A, showing that the Herceptin binding epitope on HER2 is retained. The structure of bH1/VEGF complex show that the Fab recognizes an epitope that overlaps with the binding sites of the VEGF receptors and other VEGF binding. Consistent with this observation, bH1 inhibits the VEGF\u2010stimulated growth of endothelial cells. Comparison of the bH1/VEGF and the bH1/HER2 complexes shows an extensive overlap of the VEGF and HER2 binding sites on bH1; eleven out of the thirteen bH1 residues that are in close contact with HER2 also make contact with VEGF. In the HER2 complex, the LC and HC CDRs contribute approximately equal antigen contact area (53% and 47% respectively) while in the VEGF complex, the LC CDRs constitute nearly 70% of the buried surface. With exception of CDR\u2010L1, the CDR conformations of the bH1 Fab bound to VEGF are strikingly similar to those observed in bH1 or Herceptin bound to HER2. The capability of CDR\u2010L1 to rearrange appears to be necessary for the dual specificity of bH1. Shotgun scanning mutagenesis studies were performed to assess the energetic contributions of individual CDR residues to VEGF and HER2 binding and to determine the strategies to improve the two binding affinities. In contrast to the extensive overlap between buried surfaces in the interfaces of bH1 bound to either VEGF or HER2, the two functional paratopes show only limited overlap. The VEGF binding interaction is energetically mediated by the LC CDRs primarily whereas HER2\u2010binding is dominated by HC CDRs. Compared to Herceptin, bH1 maintains the same core hot spot residues for HER2 binding. The structural and functional studies show that the interactions between bH1 and the two entirely unrelated large proteins are distinct, and are characterized by conformational adaptation of the antigen binding site and differential engagement of V L and V H . The molecular versatility observed in the dual specific bH1 is reminiscent of other antibodies binding distinct molecules. To facilitate the investigation of the in vivo activity of bH1, we generated versions of bH1 with high affinity and specificity for HER2 and VEGF. We use the information of the shotgun mutagenesis scanning to design two sets of libraries of bH1 variants. From the library based on bH1, we derived bH1\u201381 (K D =58/6 nM VEGF/HER2). Based on bH1\u201381, we generated randomize libraries to derive the high affinity bH1\u201344 (K D = 3/0.2nM VEGF/HER2). The affinity improved bH1 variants inhibit VEGF\u2010induced proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and the growth of the HER2 overexpressing breast cancer cell line BT474 with improved potencies correlated with their relative affinities. The high affinity bH1\u201344 now inhibits the growth of HUVEC and BT474 cells with potencies similar to bevacizumab or Herceptin, respectively. To examine the two unique activities of bH1\u201344 in vivo , we employed mouse xenograft tumor models known to be responsive to treatment by anti\u2010VEGF antibodies (Colo205, a human colorectal cancer cell line) or Herceptin (BT474M1, human breast cancer cell line). The bH1\u201344 treated groups were compared with those treated with anti\u2010VEGF (B20\u20104.1), Herceptin, or the combination (Herceptin + anti\u2010VEGF). bH1\u201344 as well as B20\u20104.1 cross binds murine VEGF, The results of the Colo205 model demonstrate that the VEGF binding component of bH1\u201344 is inhibiting tumor growth, as Herceptin alone has no effect. The BT474M1 model indicates that the HER2 binding component of bH1\u201344 is active, since the effect observed with the anti\u2010VEGF control antibody is not significant. Hence, bH1\u201344 has demonstrated the pharmacological activity of a VEGF blocking antibody and a Herceptin\u2010like antibody. However, it is not yet known whether bH1\u201344 is indeed as effective as Herceptin or anti\u2010VEGF administered separately or in combination. The advantage of co\u2010targeting the tumor cell proliferation mediated by HER2 and tumor angiogenesis mediated by VEGF is currently being evaluated in clinical trials combining Herceptin and bevacizumab in breast cancer patients. These studies may indicate the potential of developing dual specific antibodies like bH1\u201344 as therapeutics. Herein, we demonstrate a general strategy to derived dual specific antibodies that can be applied to create dual specific antibodies against two defined antigens. In contrast to currently reported bispecific formats, which assemble two antigen binding units into one molecule, the dual specific \u201ctwo\u2010in\u2010one\u201d antibody we describe has the molecular structure of a regular IgG (or Fab). It has all the favourable attributes of an IgG for therapeutic development, such as predictable pharmacokinetic properties, well established manufacturing protocols, choice of Fc\u2010mediated effector functions and bi\u2010 or mono\u2010valencies. We also demonstrated that an antigen\u2010binding site is capable of interacting with two unrelated protein antigens with high affinity. Mutational analysis of bH1 and bH1\u201344 allows us to derive monospecific HER2 or VEGF antibodies from bH1\u201344 by two alanine mutations in the LC or HC CDRs, respectively. This further highlights how a limited number of mutations in the antigen\u2010binding site can alter specificity, or add an additional specificity. During development of the natural antibody repertoire, the antigen\u2010binding sites often undergo diversification by exchanging the V L that pairs with a V H . Somatic mutations also occur frequently, in particular among the residues in the periphery of the antigen\u2010binding site. Our studies reveal a mechanism by which one antibody can diverge into many antibodies with distinct specificity profiles, including dual specificity. This mechanism may contribute to the large capacity of the natural antibody repertoire for diverse antigen recognition. Citation Information: Mol Cancer Ther 2009;8(12 Suppl):CN07-01.",

            "text": "Monoclonal antibodies are typically characterized by their exquisite specificity toward single antigens, which has been the basis for the successful use of antibodies as targeted therapeutics. There is, however, increasing appreciation for antibody multi\u2010specificity and how it may play a role in the immune responses. As the total number of antibody producing lymphocytes in each individual is finite (10 7\u20139 ) and the varieties of potential foreign antigens is infinite, the ability of one antibody to recognize more than one antigen may expand the effective size of the antibody repertoire and increase the efficiency of antigen recognition. To understand the molecular mechanism of how one antibody may accommodate different antigens, previous studies set out to identify unique binding molecules for antibodies distinct from the cognate antigens by selection from synthetic repertoires of peptides or proteins. Although the affinities of these isolated \u2018antigens\u2019 are generally weak, they demonstrated that one antigen\u2010binding site is capable of distinct interaction (James et al., 2003; Kramer et al., 1997; Sethi et al., 2006). We set out to understand the role of antibody multispecificity from a different angle. We want to discover antibodies that are dual specific against two related antigens with high affinity, so as to reveal the mechanism of the multispecific antibodies that are able to play a functional and physiological role due to the high affinity. We also want to identify a general strategy to generate such antibodies against two defined antigens de novo by evolving a monospecific antibody to bind a second antigen. This may provide an option to therapeutically target two molecules with one antibody, and also provide insight into the propensity and mechanism of adding a distinct binding specificity to a matured antibody and the evolution of binding specificity. We explore whether a mono\u2010specific antibody, HERCEPTIN\u00ae, which binds human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2, ErbB2), can be evolved into one that binds a second binding specificity toward a distinct antigen and maintains its HER2\u2010binding ability. We generated a repertoire of Herceptin antibody variants by mutating in the light chain (LC) complementarity determining regions (CDRs) in a manner that mimic the natural diversity. From this repertoire of Fabs displayed on M13 phage we isolated variants that have 3\u201317 substitution or insertion compared to Herceptin and can bind the new antigens. Some of them maintained HER2 binding and are thus dual specific. The approach is based on the understanding that modifications of the LC sequence can modulate the binding specificity of antibodies. In addition, many antibodies, with Herceptin as a prime example (Cho et al., 2003; Kelley and O9Connell, 1993), bind the antigens by utilizing mainly the heavy chain (HC) CDRs, suggesting that mutations in the LC CDRs might allow preservation of the original antigen\u2010binding specificity. We chose to focus on a dual specific variant of Herceptin bH1 that binds vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in addition to HER2 with dissociation constant (Kd) of 300nM and 26 nM, respectively. Further, bH1 exhibited inhibitory activity in the proliferation of VEGF\u2010stimulated endothelial cells (HUVEC) and HER2 overexpressing BT474 breast cancer cell line, suggesting that bH1 retained the HER2\u2010binding function of Herceptin, and acquired a VEGF\u2010blocking activity. To understand the molecular mechanism of the dual specificity, we solved the crystal structures of bH1 in complex with VEGF (the receptor binding domain, residue 8\u2013109) and HER2 (residue 1\u2013624) at 2.6 anf 2.9 A resolution.

While na\u20ac \u0131ve libraries provide natural diversity by combination of functional V-gene segments isolated from the lymphoid tissues of non-immunized donors [e.g. CAT 1.0 and CAT 2.0 libraries of Cambridge Antibody Technology (Lloyd et al., 2008)109)], synthetic libraries such as the HuCALs (Morphosys) offer any desired amino acid compositions in the CDRs (Knappik et al., 2000)(Prassler et al., 2011). In general, it was observed that, despite the hypervariability of CDR sequences, there is a bias of functional CDRs to certain amino acid types, most of all tyrosine, glycine, and serine (Zemlin et al., 2003). Fellouse et al. showed that while scFv variants binding to some antigens at nanomolar affinities were selected from phage display libraries providing only a binary amino acid repertoire (i.e. tyrosine and serine), selections of binders from the same libraries to other antigens yielded affinities only in the micromolar range (113)(114)(115).

A consensus sequence was derived for each family and optimized for expression in Escherichia coli. In order to make all six complementarity determining regions (CDRs) accessible for diversification, the synthetic genes were designed to be modular and mutually compatible by introducing unique restriction endonuclease sites flanking the CDRs. Molecular modeling verified that all canonical classes were present. We could show that all master genes are expressed as soluble proteins in the periplasm of E. coli. A first set of antibody phage display libraries totalling 2x10(9) members was created after cloning the genes in all 49 combinations into a phagemid vector, itself devoid of the restriction sites in question. Diversity was created by replacing the V(H) and V(L) CDR3 regions of the master genes by CDR3 library cassettes, generated from mixed trinucleotides and biased towards natural human antibody CDR3 sequences. The sequencing of 257 members of the unselected libraries indicated that the frequency of correct and thus potentially functional sequences was 61 %. Selection experiments against many antigens yielded a diverse set of binders with high affinities. Due to the modular design of all master genes, either single binders or even pools of binders can now be rapidly optimized without knowledge of the particular sequence, using pre-built CDR cassette libraries. The small number of 49 master genes will allow future improvements to be incorporated quickly, and the separation of the frameworks may help in analyzing why nature has evolved these distinct subfamilies of antibody germline genes.",

Analysis of a sample of >800 antibodies from the unselected library indicates V gene usage is representative of the human immune system with no strong bias towards any particular V(H)-V(L) pairing. Germline diversity is broad with 45/49 functional V(H) germlines and 28/30 V(lambda) and 30/35 V(kappa) light-chain germlines represented in the sample. The number of functional V(H) germlines and V(kappa) light-chain germlines present is increased to 48/49 and 31/35, respectively, when selected V gene usage is included in the analysis. However, following selection on the antigen panel, V(H)1-V(lambda)1 germline family pairings are preferentially enriched and represent a remarkable 25% of the antigen-specific selected repertoire."

While na\u20ac \u0131ve libraries provide natural diversity by combination of functional V-gene segments isolated from the lymphoid tissues of non-immunized donors [e.g. CAT 1.0 and CAT 2.0 libraries of Cambridge Antibody Technology (Lloyd et al., 2008)109)], synthetic libraries such as the HuCALs (Morphosys) offer any desired amino acid compositions in the CDRs (Knappik et al., 2000)(Prassler et al., 2011). In general, it was observed that, despite the hypervariability of CDR sequences, there is a bias of functional CDRs to certain amino acid types, most of all tyrosine, glycine, and serine (Zemlin et al., 2003). Fellouse et al. showed that while scFv variants binding to some antigens at nanomolar affinities were selected from phage display libraries providing only a binary amino acid repertoire (i.e. tyrosine and serine), selections of binders from the same libraries to other antigens yielded affinities only in the micromolar range (113)(114)(115). Modifications of these libraries included an increased chemical diversity in CDR-H3 and the consideration of non-paratope residues potentially important for CDR conformation (116)."

This repertoire design was highly effective in generating nM-affinity clones with specificity for a selection of proteins and peptides (Knappik et al., 2000)(Marget et al., 2000). \n\nThe methods used by (Knappik et al., 2000) have since been elaborated upon in a number of reports. (Rothe et al., 2008), reported the construction of the next-generation library HuCal Gold\u2122 in which the design strategy was refined to change the CDR design complexity, the structural format of the library (to Fab fragment) and also to move to \"CysDisplay\" in which the expressed antibody is tethered to the phage via a disulphide bond with a mutant p3 protein. In this library, the CDR diversity was extended to the CDRs 1 and 2 of both V-domains, in addition to the CDR3s. The CDR cassettes were again based on trinucleotide technology and were built to accurately reflect the canonical structures and diversity found in the families upon which each of the consensus frameworks were built, consciously including structures known to be preferred in the recognition of peptides.",

A consensus sequence was derived for each family and optimized for expression in Escherichia coli. In order to make all six complementarity determining regions (CDRs) accessible for diversification, the synthetic genes were designed to be modular and mutually compatible by introducing unique restriction endonuclease sites flanking the CDRs. Molecular modeling verified that all canonical classes were present. We could show that all master genes are expressed as soluble proteins in the periplasm of E. coli. A first set of antibody phage display libraries totalling 2x10(9) members was created after cloning the genes in all 49 combinations into a phagemid vector, itself devoid of the restriction sites in question. Diversity was created by replacing the V(H) and V(L) CDR3 regions of the master genes by CDR3 library cassettes, generated from mixed trinucleotides and biased towards natural human antibody CDR3 sequences. The sequencing of 257 members of the unselected libraries indicated that the frequency of correct and thus potentially functional sequences was 61 %. Selection experiments against many antigens yielded a diverse set of binders with high affinities. Due to the modular design of all master genes, either single binders or even pools of binders can now be rapidly optimized without knowledge of the particular sequence, using pre-built CDR cassette libraries. The small number of 49 master genes will allow future improvements to be incorporated quickly, and the separation of the frameworks may help in analyzing why nature has evolved these distinct subfamilies of antibody germline genes.",

In the present study, HLA-C-specific scFv were isolated using a synthetic phage library in combination with a Cw*0602 overexpressing cell line. ScFv from this procedure precipitated HLA-Cw*0602 heavy chains from whole cell lysates. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that scFv stained HLA-Cw*0602-positive cells, but not cells expressing HLA alleles Cw*0302, Cw*0802, A*0201, B*2705, or Gm1*01011, indicating the specificity of scFv. Similarly they showed an ability to discriminate Cw*0602-positive from Cw*0602-negative peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). The results of our study demonstrate the feasibility to genetically engineer single-chain HLA-class I-specific antibodies, by phage display technology. This approach might be a valuable tool to develop a broad range of novel monospecific antibodies against HLA-class I specificities."

In this library, the CDR diversity was extended to the CDRs 1 and 2 of both V-domains, in addition to the CDR3s. The CDR cassettes were again based on trinucleotide technology and were built to accurately reflect the canonical structures and diversity found in the families upon which each of the consensus frameworks were built, consciously including structures known to be preferred in the recognition of peptides."

Current routes to single cell production of bispecific IgG include engineering heavy chains for heterodimerization and redesign of Fab arms for selective pairing of cognate heavy and light chains. Here, we describe novel designs to facilitate selective Fab arm assembly in conjunction with previously described knobs-into-holes mutations for preferential heavy chain heterodimerization. The top Fab designs for selective pairing, namely variants v10 and v11, support near quantitative assembly of bispecific IgG in single cells for multiple different antibody pairs as judged by high-resolution mass spectrometry. Single-cell and in vitro-assembled bispecific IgG have comparable physical, in vitro biological and in vivo pharmacokinetics properties. Efficient single-cell production of bispecific IgG was demonstrated for human IgG1, IgG2 and IgG4 thereby allowing the heavy chain isotype to be tailored for specific therapeutic applications. Additionally, a reverse chimeric bispecific IgG2a with humanized variable domains and mouse constant domains was generated for preclinical proof-of-concept studies in mice. Efficient production of a bispecific IgG in stably transfected mammalian (CHO) cells was shown. Individual clones with stable titer and bispecific IgG composition for >120 days were readily identified. Such long-term cell line stability is needed for commercial manufacture of bispecific IgG. The single-cell bispecific IgG designs developed here may be broadly applicable to biotechnology research, including screening bispecific IgG panels, and to support clinical development."

The CDRH3 loop, which exists in a variety of different lengths (5-30 amino acids), is of particular importance due to its substantial impact on the canonical conformation and antigen binding compared to the other CDRs (Tsuchiya et al., 2016)(Chothia et al., 1989)(Chothia et al., 1987)(Shirai et al., 1999)(Kumar et al., 2019). Noteworthy, the loop length of CDRH3 does not only affect the specificity and affinity of the antibody for its specific antigen, but also affects the nature of the binding of other CDRs. Specifically, for antibodies with long CDRH3 loops, these loops are responsible for most of the antibody-antigen interactions, while in antibodies with short CDRH3 loops, other CDRs loops usually assist in antigen binding (Tsuchiya et al., 2016). Thus, CDRH3 plays a major role in recognizing diverse targets, and generating interactions with acceptable affinity (Xu et al., 2000)(Zadeh et al., 2019)...The diversity of the V-gene segments can be designed and synthesized artificially by CDRs randomization. These libraries can be fully synthetic or semisynthetic. Synthetic libraries are made to maximize antibodies' functionality by making a large and highly diverse phage repertoire. This is usually achieved in vitro by using PCR and oligonucleotides to create a random integration of the CDRs as well as introduction of different CDRH3 loop sequences and lengths without disrupting the folding of the V regions (Griffiths et al., 1994)168). Semisynthetic libraries combine natural and synthetic antibody diversity. They are constructed from non-rearranged Vgenes from pre-B cells, or an antibody framework with randomization of the CDRH3 or several CDRs utilizing degenerated oligonucleotides (Valadon et al., 2019)(Barbas et al., 1992)(Rauchenberger et al., 2003).",

This involves 79 hypervariable regions in all. We also analysed a part of the H3 region in 12 of the 15 VH domains considered here. On the basis of the residues at key sites the 79 hypervariable regions can be assigned to one of 18 different canonical structures. We show that 71 of these hypervariable regions have a conformation that is very close to what can be defined as a \"standard\" conformation of each canonical structure. These standard conformations are described in detail. The other eight hypervariable regions have small deviations from the standard conformations that, in six cases, involve only the rotation of a single peptide group. Most H3 hypervariable regions have the same conformation in the part that is close to the framework and the details of this conformation are also described here.",

These single-chain variable fragment (scFv), semisynthetic libraries are built on synthetic human well-known IGHV and IGKV germline genes combined with natural human complementarity-determining region (CDR)-H3/JH (H3J) fragments. One IGHV gene provided a universal VH scaffold and was paired with two IGKV scaffolds to furnish different topographies for binding distinct epitopes. The scaffolds were diversified at positions identified as in contact with antigens in the known antigen-antibody complex structures. The diversification regime consisted of high-usage amino acids found at those positions in human antibody sequences. Functionality, stability and diversity of the libraries were improved throughout a three-step construction process. In a first step, fully synthetic primary libraries were generated by combining the diversified scaffolds with a set of synthetic neutral H3J germline gene fragments. The second step consisted of selecting the primary libraries for enhanced thermostability based on the natural capacity of Protein A to bind the universal VH scaffold. In the third and final step, the resultant stable synthetic antibody fragments were combined with natural H3J fragments obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of a large pool of 200 donors. Validation of ALTHEA Gold Libraries\u2122 with seven targets yielded specific antibodies in all the cases. Further characterization of the isolated antibodies indicated KD values as human IgG1 molecules in the single-digit and sub-nM range. The thermal stability (Tm) of all the antigen-binding fragments was 75\u00b0C\u201380\u00b0C, demonstrating that ALTHEA Gold Libraries\u2122 are a valuable source of specific, high affinity and highly stable antibodies.",

The modularity has been retained in the Fab display and screening plasmids, ensuring rapid conversion into various antibody formats as well as antibody optimization using prebuilt maturation cassettes. HuCAL\u00ae-Fab 1 was challenged against the human fibroblast growth factor receptor 3, a potential therapeutic antibody target, against which, to the best of our knowledge, no functional antibodies could be generated so far. A unique screening mode was designed utilizing recombinant functional proteins and cell lines differentially expressing fibroblast growth factor receptor isoforms diversified in expression and receptor dependence. Specific Fab fragments with subnanomolar affinities were isolated by selection without any maturation steps as determined by fluorescence flow cytometry. Some of the selected Fab fragments completely inhibit target-mediated cell proliferation, rendering them the first monoclonal antibodies against fibroblast growth factor receptors having significant function blocking activity. This study validates HuCAL\u00ae-Fab 1 as a valuable source for the generation of target-specific antibodies for therapeutic applications.",

But, several technical challenges are associated with the selection process. For instance, during the panning step, the successful elution of the phages bound to the antigen is critical in order to avoid losing the most promising binders. Here, we present an efficient protocol to establish, screen and select synthetic libraries of domain antibodies using phage display. We do not only present suitable solutions to the above-mentioned challenges to improve elution by 50-fold, but we also present a step by step in-depth protocol with miniaturized volumes and optimized procedures to save material, costs and time for a successful phage display with domain antibodies. Hence, this protocol improves the selection process for an efficient handling process. The here presented library is based on the variable domain (vNAR) of the naturally occurring novel antibody receptor (IgNAR) from cartilage fishes.

The CDRs L3 and H3 offer a theoretical diversity of the order of 10^7 and 10^17 unique sequences, respectively (Figure S1D). Ultimately, the four CDRs combined offer a practical diversity approximating 10^11 unique clones.",

A consensus sequence was derived for each family and optimized for expression in Escherichia coli. In order to make all six complementarity determining regions (CDRs) accessible for diversification, the synthetic genes were designed to be modular and mutually compatible by introducing unique restriction endonuclease sites flanking the CDRs. Molecular modeling verified that all canonical classes were present. We could show that all master genes are expressed as soluble proteins in the periplasm of E. coli. A first set of antibody phage display libraries totalling 2x10(9) members was created after cloning the genes in all 49 combinations into a phagemid vector, itself devoid of the restriction sites in question. Diversity was created by replacing the V(H) and V(L) CDR3 regions of the master genes by CDR3 library cassettes, generated from mixed trinucleotides and biased towards natural human antibody CDR3 sequences. The sequencing of 257 members of the unselected libraries indicated that the frequency of correct and thus potentially functional sequences was 61 %. Selection experiments against many antigens yielded a diverse set of binders with high affinities. Due to the modular design of all master genes, either single binders or even pools of binders can now be rapidly optimized without knowledge of the particular sequence, using pre-built CDR cassette libraries. The small number of 49 master genes will allow future improvements to be incorporated quickly, and the separation of the frameworks may help in analyzing why nature has evolved these distinct subfamilies of antibody germline genes.",

The variable Ig heavy and Ig light (VH/VL) chain pairs were selected for biophysical characteristics favorable to manufacturing and development. The selection process included multiple parameters, e.g., assessment of protein expression yield, thermal stability and aggregation propensity in fragment antigen binding (Fab) and IgG1 formats, and relative Fab display rate on phage. The framework regions are fixed and the diversified CDRs were designed based on a systematic analysis of a large set of rearranged human antibody sequences. Care was taken to minimize the occurrence of potential posttranslational modification sites within the CDRs.

                "snippets": "Comparing the CDR loops interactions in the different systems, it is evident that the LC germlines present in the most stable Fabs (L3-11 and L1-39) are also the ones in which the paratope is highly stabilized. Focusing on the CDR-H3/CDR-L3 interactions, when an Arg is present as third residue of the CDR-L3 loop, as in the germline L3-11, it forms more interactions with the CDR-H3 loop rather than when a Tyr or a Ser is in the same position (Fig. 2a). As previously discussed in literature, Arg located in the CDR loops, is a critical determinant for affinity (Giles et al., 2003)(Giles et al., 2003)(Birtalan et al., 2008). In this case, it seems that this residue may play an important role in the stabilization of the CDR-H3 loop, too. \n\nThe CDR-L1 and the CDR-L2 loops also interact with the CDR-H3 loop, even if their contacts are less occurrent than the ones between CDR-L3 and CDR-H3 loop (SI Fig. 7). In our dataset, CDR-L1 loops show quite some differences in sequence and length, whereas CDR-L2 loops share the same length but differ in sequence. Loop length variation is proven to be a valid strategy for affinity maturation of antibodies, since it influences tertiary structure and activity simultaneously (Brockmann et al., 2020)(Clark et al., 2008). However, an enhancement in affinity does not always go hand in hand with a higher stability. In our dataset, for example, the two germlines with longer CDR-L1 loops, L3-20 and L4-1 (respectively 12 and 17 AA) show only few stabilizing contacts with the CDR-H3 loop. Instead, the L1-39 germline, which is also the most stable one, makes the highest number of interactions (SI Fig. 7a).",

The authors tested this hypothesis by carrying out a systematic analysis of all published aPL sequences.\n\n\nMETHODS\nEach aPL variable region sequence was aligned to the closest germline counterpart in the VBASE Sequence Directory by using DNAPLOT software, allowing analysis of nucleotide homology and distribution of somatic mutations. The probability that this distribution arose as a result of antigen-driven accumulation of replacement mutations in the CDRs was tested statistically.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere was no preferential gene or family use in the 36 aPL sequences identified. Immunoglobulin (Ig) M aPL had few somatic mutations compared with IgG. Of the IgG aPL, 9 of 14 showed evidence of antigen-driven accumulation of replacement mutations in the CDRs. Multinomial analysis allowed a clearer statistical identification of sequences that had been subject to antigen drive. The more specific IgM aPL and some IgG aPL displayed an accumulation of arginine, asparagine, and lysine residues in CDRs.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nHigh-specificity binding in IgG aPL, but not in more specific IgM aPL, is conferred by antigen-driven somatic mutation. This may in part be caused by an accumulation of arginine, asparagine, and lysine residues in the CDRs, which are germlines encoded in the more specific IgM aPL, but often arise because of somatic mutation in IgG aPL.\n\n\nRELEVANCE\nAn understanding of the role of arginine, asparagine, and lysine residues in the binding of pathogenic aPL to phospholipids, and to beta(2)-glycoprotein I, may eventually help in the development of drugs to interfere with those interactions, and thereby improve the treatment of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.",

A detailed analysis for the L1 loop shows that each loop length takes a distinct conformation, thereby allowing control on a length scale beyond that accessible to simple mutations. The L1 loop in the anti-VLA1 antibody was replaced with the L2 loop residues longer in an attempt to add an additional hydrogen bond and fill space on the antibody-antigen interface. The designs expressed well, but failed to improve affinity. In an effort to learn more, one design was crystallized and data were collected at 1.9 A resolution. The designed L1 loop takes the qualitatively desired conformation; confirming that loop replacement by design is feasible. The crystal structure also shows that the outermost loop (residues Leu51-Ser68) is domain swapped with another monomer. Tryptophan fluorescence measurements were used to monitor unfolding as a function of temperature and indicate that the loop involved in domain swapping does not unfold below 60 degrees C. The domain-swapping is not directly responsible for the affinity loss, but is likely a side-effect of the structural instability which may contribute to affinity loss. A second round of design was successful in eliminating the dimerization through mutation of a residue (Leu51Ser) at the joint of the domain-swapped loop.",
                    "[8032988 | Giles et al. | 2003 | Citations: 27]": "Previously we reported that the variable heavy chain region (VH) of a human beta2 glycoprotein I-dependent monoclonal antiphospholipid antibody (IS4) was dominant in conferring the ability to bind cardiolipin (CL). In contrast, the identity of the paired variable light chain region (VL) determined the strength of CL binding. In the present study, we examine the importance of specific arginine residues in IS4VH and paired VL in CL binding. The distribution of arginine residues in complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of VH and VL sequences was altered by site-directed mutagenesis or by CDR exchange. Ten different 2a2 germline gene-derived VL sequences were expressed with IS4VH and the VH of an anti-dsDNA antibody, B3. Six variants of IS4VH, containing different patterns of arginine residues in CDR3, were paired with B3VL and IS4VL. The ability of the 32 expressed heavy chain/light chain combinations to bind CL was determined by ELISA. Of four arginine residues in IS4VH CDR3 substituted to serines, two residues at positions 100 and 100 g had a major influence on the strength of CL binding while the two residues at positions 96 and 97 had no effect. In CDR exchange studies, VL containing B3VL CDR1 were associated with elevated CL binding, which was reduced significantly by substitution of a CDR1 arginine residue at position 27a with serine. In contrast, arginine residues in VL CDR2 or VL CDR3 did not enhance CL binding, and in one case may have contributed to inhibition of this binding. Subsets of arginine residues at specific locations in the CDRs of heavy chains and light chains of pathogenic antiphospholipid antibodies are important in determining their ability to bind CL."

Focusing on the CDR-H3/CDR-L3 interactions, when an Arg is present as third residue of the CDR-L3 loop, as in the germline L3-11, it forms more interactions with the CDR-H3 loop rather than when a Tyr or a Ser is in the same position (Fig. 2a). As previously discussed in literature, Arg located in the CDR loops, is a critical determinant for affinity (Giles et al., 2003)(Giles et al., 2003)(Birtalan et al., 2008). In this case, it seems that this residue may play an important role in the stabilization of the CDR-H3 loop, too. \n\nThe CDR-L1 and the CDR-L2 loops also interact with the CDR-H3 loop, even if their contacts are less occurrent than the ones between CDR-L3 and CDR-H3 loop (SI Fig. 7). In our dataset, CDR-L1 loops show quite some differences in sequence and length, whereas CDR-L2 loops share the same length but differ in sequence. Loop length variation is proven to be a valid strategy for affinity maturation of antibodies, since it influences tertiary structure and activity simultaneously (Brockmann et al., 2020)(Clark et al., 2008). However, an enhancement in affinity does not always go hand in hand with a higher stability. In our dataset, for example, the two germlines with longer CDR-L1 loops, L3-20 and L4-1 (respectively 12 and 17 AA) show only few stabilizing contacts with the CDR-H3 loop. Instead, the L1-39 germline, which is also the most stable one, makes the highest number of interactions (SI Fig. 7a)."

They show excellent robustness, are non-immunogenic in humans, and can easily be engineered and produced in prokaryotic hosts. Traditionally, nanobodies are selected from camelid immune libraries involving the maintenance and treatment of animals. Recent advances have involved the generation of nanobodies from na\u00efve or synthetic libraries. However, such approaches demand large library sizes and sophisticated selection procedures. Here, we propose an alternative, two-step approach for the design and generation of nanobodies. In a first step, complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) are grafted from conventional antibody formats onto nanobody frameworks, generating weak antigen binders. In a second step, the weak binders serve as templates to design focused synthetic phage libraries for affinity maturation. We validated this approach by grafting toxin- and hapten-specific CDRs onto frameworks derived from variable domains of camelid heavy-chain-only antibodies (VHH). We then affinity matured the hapten binder via panning of a synthetic phage library. We suggest that this strategy can complement existing immune, na\u00efve, and synthetic library based methods, requiring neither animal experiments, nor large libraries, nor sophisticated selection protocols."

For the most part the antigen is bound in the middle of the antibody combining site with most of the six complementarity-determining residues involved in binding. For the most studied antigen, lysozyme, the epitopes for four antibodies occupy approximately 45% of the accessible surface area. Some conformational changes have been observed to accompany binding in both the antibody and the antigen, although most of the information on conformational change in the latter comes from studies of complexes with small antigens.",

Upon leukocyte activation, Mac-1 undergoes a conformational change exposing interaction sites for multiple ligands. We aimed to generate single-chain antibodies (scFv's) directed against activation-specific Mac-1 ligand-binding sites. Using human scFv phage libraries, we developed subtractive strategies with depletion of phages binding to nonactivated Mac-1 and selection of phages binding to activated Mac-1, using monocytes as well as CHO cells transfected with native or mutated, activated Mac-1. Three scFv clones demonstrated exclusive binding to activated Mac-1. Mac-1 binding of the ligands fibrinogen, heparin, and ICAM-1, but not C3bi, was inhibited. Using alanine substitutions, the paratope was identified within the heavy chain HCDR3s of the scFv's. The epitope was localized to Lys(245)-Arg(261) of the alpha(M) I-domain. In a pilot study with septicemic patients, we provide initial support for the use of these scFv's as markers of monocyte activation and as potential diagnostic tools. Potential therapeutic use was tested in adhesion assays under static and flow conditions demonstrating the selective blockade of activated monocytes only. Furthermore, scFv HCDR3-derived peptides retain selectivity for the activated integrin, providing a unique template for the potential development of inhibitors that are specific for the activated Mac-1."

CDR3 of the light (V(L)) and heavy (V(H)) chain variable region of C6.5 were sequentially mutated, the mutant scFv displayed on phage, and higher affinity mutants selected on antigen. Mutation of V(L) CDR3 yielded a scFv (C6ML3-9) with a 16-fold lower Kd (1.0 x 10(-9) M) than C6.5. Due to its length of 20 amino acids, four V(H) CDR3 libraries of C6ML3-9 were constructed. The greatest increase in affinity from a single library was ninefold (Kd = 1.1 x 10(-10) M). Combination of mutations isolated from separate V(H) CDR3 libraries yielded additional ninefold decreases in Kd, resulting in a scFv with a 1230-fold increase in affinity from wild-type C6.5 (Kd = 1.3 x 10(-11) M). The increase in affinity, and its absolute value, are comparable to the largest values observed for antibody affinity maturation in vivo or in vitro and indicate that mutation of V(L) and V(H) CDR3 may be a particularly efficient means to increase antibody affinity. This result, combined with the location of amino acid conservation and substitution, suggests an overall strategy for in vitro antibody affinity maturation. In addition, the affinities and binding kinetics of the single-chain Fv provide reagents with potential tumor targeting abilities not previously available."

This will help orient readers to the topic before diving into specifics. This is a synthesis section because it needs to provide coherent background information rather than a list of discrete items.\n\n2. \"Natural vs. Synthetic CDR Diversification Strategies\" (synthesis format): This dimension will compare approaches to creating CDR diversity in phage display libraries, contrasting natural diversity (from B-cells) with synthetic approaches. This requires a coherent explanation of the advantages and limitations of each approach, making synthesis format appropriate.\n\n3. \"CDR-H3 Contributions to Antibody Diversity and Function\" (synthesis format): This dimension will specifically focus on how CDR-H3 design choices (length, amino acid composition, etc.) affect antibody properties. A synthesis is needed to explain the relationships between design choices and functional outcomes.\n\n4. \"CDR-L3 Contributions to Antibody Diversity and Function\" (synthesis format): Similar to the previous dimension but focusing on light chain CDR-L3. This requires synthesis to explain the complex relationships between CDR-L3 characteristics and antibody function.\n\n5. \"Interaction Between CDR-H3 and CDR-L3\" (synthesis format): This dimension will address how the interplay between heavy and light chain CDRs, particularly H3 and L3, affects antibody properties. This relationship is complex and best explained in synthesis format.\n\n6. \"Amino Acid Composition and Restrictions in CDR Design\" (synthesis format): This dimension will focus on specific amino acid preferences/restrictions in CDR design and how they influence antibody properties. A synthesis is needed to explain patterns and their consequences.\n\n7. \"CDR Diversification Impact on Therapeutic Properties\" (list format): This dimension will provide specific examples of how CDR diversification strategies lead to desirable therapeutic antibody properties. A list format works well here to clearly enumerate distinct therapeutic advantages.\n\n8. \"CDR Optimization Techniques for Improved Antibody Function\" (list format): This dimension will outline specific techniques used to optimize CDRs for better antibody performance.

These CDRs extend outward from the antibody framework and directly contact the antigen, determining the specificity and affinity of the antibody-antigen interaction. Among these, CDR-H3 typically exhibits the greatest sequence diversity and often makes the most significant contribution to antigen recognition, while CDR-L3 also plays a crucial supporting role. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">\n\nPhage display is a powerful in vitro selection technology that has revolutionized antibody discovery by enabling the screening of massive antibody libraries (often exceeding 10^10 variants) against virtually any target of interest. This technique involves genetically fusing antibody fragments\u2014typically single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) or antigen-binding fragments (Fabs)\u2014to the coat proteins of bacteriophages, creating a physical linkage between an antibody's phenotype (binding properties) and its genotype (encoding DNA). When these phage-displayed antibody libraries are exposed to immobilized target antigens, phages displaying antibodies with appropriate CDR sequences that bind the target can be captured, amplified through bacterial infection, and subjected to multiple rounds of selection to isolate high-affinity binders. The diversity and design of CDRs, particularly CDR-H3 and CDR-L3, within these libraries critically influence the functional range and therapeutic potential of the antibodies that can be discovered. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">",

Natural diversification captures antibody sequences directly from B-cells of naive or immunized donors, preserving the immune system's evolved diversity. As demonstrated by the Cambridge Antibody Technology libraries (CAT 1.0 and CAT 2.0), these naive libraries incorporate V-gene segments from large donor pools (up to 160 donors), resulting in broad germline diversity with representation of most functional V(H) and V(L) genes <Paper corpusId=\"205293565\" paperTitle=\"(Lloyd et al., 2008)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"11736660\" paperTitle=\"(Lobner et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>. The natural approach's key advantage lies in maintaining physiologically relevant sequence patterns that have been evolutionarily selected for proper folding and function.\n\nSynthetic diversification strategies, in contrast, use controlled randomization of CDR sequences through techniques such as trinucleotide synthesis and codon-based oligonucleotides to create precisely designed antibody libraries. The HuCAL (Human Combinatorial Antibody Library) developed by Morphosys exemplifies this approach, where consensus sequences derived from germline families were optimized for expression and equipped with unique restriction sites flanking the CDRs to facilitate diversification <Paper corpusId=\"15340484\" paperTitle=\"(Knappik et al., 2000)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"11736660\" paperTitle=\"(Lobner et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>. Synthetic libraries can be fully randomized or incorporate biases toward amino acids commonly found in functional CDRs, particularly tyrosine, serine, and glycine <Paper corpusId=\"11736660\" paperTitle=\"(Lobner et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"246433314\" paperTitle=\"(Davydova, 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nInterestingly, some minimalist synthetic libraries containing only two residues (tyrosine and serine) in their CDRs have proven highly effective in generating specific antibodies against various antigens, supporting the natural abundance of these residues in natural antibody repertoires <Paper corpusId=\"246433314\" paperTitle=\"(Davydova, 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. However, subsequent research has highlighted that incorporating glycine into CDR-H3 is critical for enabling high-affinity binding through proper paratope conformation <Paper corpusId=\"270629223\" paperTitle=\"(Hutchings et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nSemisynthetic approaches represent a hybrid strategy that combines the advantages of both natural and synthetic diversification. For example, Dyax created libraries using synthetic diversity in CDR-H1 and CDR-H2 while incorporating natural CDR-H3 sequences from donors with various autoimmune diseases and healthy individuals <Paper corpusId=\"10576257\" paperTitle=\"(Ponsel et al., 2011)\" isShortName></Paper>. Similarly, the n-CoDer\u2122 library and Generation Three designs graft naturally occurring CDRs from human antibodies into frameworks based on well-behaved clinical antibodies, while eliminating sequence liabilities <Paper corpusId=\"270629223\" paperTitle=\"(Hutchings et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. The ALTHEA Gold Libraries\u2122 follow a similar approach, using synthetic human germline genes combined with natural human CDR-H3/JH fragments collected from 200 donors <Paper corpusId=\"221342908\" paperTitle=\"(Alfaleh et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"58554427\" paperTitle=\"(Valadon et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nAcross all strategies, CDR-H3 receives special attention due to its critical role in antigen binding. With lengths ranging from 5-30 amino acids, CDR-H3 typically contributes most significantly to antigen recognition compared to other CDRs <Paper corpusId=\"221342908\" paperTitle=\"(Alfaleh et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"27152869\" paperTitle=\"(Al-Lazikani et al., 1997)\" isShortName></Paper>. Studies have shown that in antibodies with long CDR-H3 loops, these regions dominate antibody-antigen interactions, while in antibodies with shorter CDR-H3 loops, other CDRs play more prominent supporting roles <Paper corpusId=\"221342908\" paperTitle=\"(Alfaleh et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. The diversification of CDR-H3 can be achieved through both sequence variation and length diversity, with research indicating that restricted diversity in CDR-H1 and CDR-H2 combined with highly variable CDR-H3 sequences improves library performance <Paper corpusId=\"10576257\" paperTitle=\"(Ponsel et al., 2011)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nImportantly, CDR loop length and composition significantly influence antibody function. Observations suggest that loop length and CDR-H3 stem composition play key roles in functional output, while diversification of CDR-L3, though useful, is not always essential for library performance <Paper corpusId=\"270629223\" paperTitle=\"(Hutchings et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. Additionally, the CDR capture technique enables the generation of libraries with diverse loop lengths that can access difficult epitopes, including enzyme active sites or viral canyons, similar to the capabilities of camelid VHH or shark V-NAR domains <Paper corpusId=\"14660425\" paperTitle=\"(Venet et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper>.",

Over 5000 different target-specific antibodies were isolated to the 28 antigens with 3340 identified as modulating the biological function (e.g. antagonism, agonism) of the target antigen. This represents an average of approximately 120 different functionally active antibodies per target. Analysis of a sample of >800 antibodies from the unselected library indicates V gene usage is representative of the human immune system with no strong bias towards any particular V(H)-V(L) pairing. Germline diversity is broad with 45/49 functional V(H) germlines and 28/30 V(lambda) and 30/35 V(kappa) light-chain germlines represented in the sample. The number of functional V(H) germlines and V(kappa) light-chain germlines present is increased to 48/49 and 31/35, respectively, when selected V gene usage is included in the analysis. However, following selection on the antigen panel, V(H)1-V(lambda)1 germline family pairings are preferentially enriched and represent a remarkable 25% of the antigen-specific selected repertoire."

                            "The degree of CDR sequence diversification in combinatorial libraries of antibody-based alternative scaffolds, i.e. the usage of the amino acid repertoire, follows various different strategies. While na\u20ac \u0131ve libraries provide natural diversity by combination of functional V-gene segments isolated from the lymphoid tissues of non-immunized donors [e.g. CAT 1.0 and CAT 2.0 libraries of Cambridge Antibody Technology (Lloyd et al., 2008)109)], synthetic libraries such as the HuCALs (Morphosys) offer any desired amino acid compositions in the CDRs (Knappik et al., 2000)(Prassler et al., 2011). In general, it was observed that, despite the hypervariability of CDR sequences, there is a bias of functional CDRs to certain amino acid types, most of all tyrosine, glycine, and serine (Zemlin et al., 2003). Fellouse et al. showed that while scFv variants binding to some antigens at nanomolar affinities were selected from phage display libraries providing only a binary amino acid repertoire (i.e. tyrosine and serine), selections of binders from the same libraries to other antigens yielded affinities only in the micromolar range (113)(114)(115). Modifications of these libraries included an increased chemical diversity in CDR-H3 and the consideration of non-paratope residues potentially important for CDR conformation (116)."

A consensus sequence was derived for each family and optimized for expression in Escherichia coli. In order to make all six complementarity determining regions (CDRs) accessible for diversification, the synthetic genes were designed to be modular and mutually compatible by introducing unique restriction endonuclease sites flanking the CDRs. Molecular modeling verified that all canonical classes were present. We could show that all master genes are expressed as soluble proteins in the periplasm of E. coli. A first set of antibody phage display libraries totalling 2x10(9) members was created after cloning the genes in all 49 combinations into a phagemid vector, itself devoid of the restriction sites in question. Diversity was created by replacing the V(H) and V(L) CDR3 regions of the master genes by CDR3 library cassettes, generated from mixed trinucleotides and biased towards natural human antibody CDR3 sequences. The sequencing of 257 members of the unselected libraries indicated that the frequency of correct and thus potentially functional sequences was 61 %. Selection experiments against many antigens yielded a diverse set of binders with high affinities. Due to the modular design of all master genes, either single binders or even pools of binders can now be rapidly optimized without knowledge of the particular sequence, using pre-built CDR cassette libraries. The small number of 49 master genes will allow future improvements to be incorporated quickly, and the separation of the frameworks may help in analyzing why nature has evolved these distinct subfamilies of antibody germline genes."

Surprisingly, the minimalist libraries, containing sequences of only two residues, Tyr and Ser, in their CDRs, were proven highly effective in generating specific antibodies against a wide array of antigens providing a rationale for high abundance of these two residues in the CDRs of the natural immune repertoire [62]79]. Due to the simpler design, these libraries are relatively easy to construct, and, due to the smaller theoretical size, they possess higher sampling power. Involvement of more of CDRs and CDR positions into deeper diversification, while producing an exponentially increasing number of possible variants, allows to build more enhanced and sterically extended paratopes with higher conformational diversity, thus, facilitating efficient recognition of various epitopes of different types of antigens."

The semisynthetic strategy has been refined further by grafting naturally occurring CDRs from human antibodies into frameworks based on well-behaved clinical antibodies, referred to as a Generation Three design [48], in order to address the identification of highly developable therapeutic antibodies directly from the library, CDR-H3 sequences were amplified directly from B cells, while the remaining CDRs were sourced from a large next-generation sequencing dataset and all sequence liabilities eliminated. The resulting scFv library is 9 \u00d7 10 9 in size with the CDR diversity incorporated into 4 VH frameworks, 3 V\u03ba frameworks, and 1 V\u03bb framework [48]",
                            "One avenue of refining synthetic library design has been to take a minimalist strategy and decrease randomization by using a single framework with a binary code to diversify the CDR-H3. In one such study, Tyr and Ser were selected as these have been found to be highly abundant in antibody binding sites [52]",

                            "Thus, the minimalist synthetic CDR-H3 library strategy was explored further to generate antibodies with therapeutic potential [55]. Trinucleotide synthesis technology [56] was employed to introduce approx. equal quantities of all amino acids at each engineered position (other than cysteine) in order to evaluate the contribution of amino acid classes to antibody function. Therefore, libraries were constructed on a single framework scaffold, the clinically validated DP47 heavy chain and DP-K22 light chain, with either randomization of the CDR-H3 alone or the CDR-H3 and CDR-L3 and included incorporation of a range of loop lengths (in equal proportions rather than the parabolic distribution seen with the natural human antibody repertoire)",
                            "It was observed that loop length and CDR-H3 stem composition (potentially stabilizing the loop) played a key role in the functional output, whereas diversification of CDR-L3 was not essential for library performance",

                            "A design strategy of mimicking natural diversity using tailored codons was used to closely mimic the human repertoire. Different library generations were described and it could be shown that the restricted diversity in CDR-H1 and CDR-H2 improved the performance of the library whereas highly variable CDR-H3 sequences were advantageous. Affinities in the low nanomolar range were achieved using these libraries.\n\nHoet and coworkers at Dyax combined synthetic diversity in CDR-H1 and -H2 with length and sequence diversity in CDR-H3 from natural origin (Figure 3) [63]. CDR-H1 and -H2 repertoires were designed based on analysis of germlines genes with introduction of hot spot mutations. Those variable parts were constructed with codon-based oligonuceotides to avoid unwanted amino acids and stop codons, with the aim to increase the functional library size. VH3_23 was used as heavy chain acceptor and combined with the full lambda and kappa light chain repertoire. The natural diversity of the CDR-H3 and light chains originated from B-cells of 35 donors having various autoimmune diseases and 10 healthy donors in order to maximize the diversity. The light chain and all three heavy chain CDRs are independently replaceable modules to facilitate affinity maturation. From the phagemid Fab library with a size of 3.5 \u00d7 10 10 and a phage library with a size of 1.0 \u00d7 10 10 , affinities in the subnanomolar range were obtained."

                            "Among all the six CDR loops, the V H CDRs, especially V H 's CDR3 (CDRH3), are more frequently involved in the antigen binding than those in the light chain (Al-Lazikani et al., 1997)(Sela-Culang et al., 2012). The CDRH3 loop, which exists in a variety of different lengths (5-30 amino acids), is of particular importance due to its substantial impact on the canonical conformation and antigen binding compared to the other CDRs (Tsuchiya et al., 2016)(Chothia et al., 1989)(Chothia et al., 1987)(Shirai et al., 1999)(Kumar et al., 2019). Noteworthy, the loop length of CDRH3 does not only affect the specificity and affinity of the antibody for its specific antigen, but also affects the nature of the binding of other CDRs. Specifically, for antibodies with long CDRH3 loops, these loops are responsible for most of the antibody-antigen interactions, while in antibodies with short CDRH3 loops, other CDRs loops usually assist in antigen binding (Tsuchiya et al., 2016). Thus, CDRH3 plays a major role in recognizing diverse targets, and generating interactions with acceptable affinity (Xu et al., 2000)(Zadeh et al., 2019)",
                            "The diversity of the V-gene segments can be designed and synthesized artificially by CDRs randomization. These libraries can be fully synthetic or semisynthetic. Synthetic libraries are made to maximize antibodies' functionality by making a large and highly diverse phage repertoire. This is usually achieved in vitro by using PCR and oligonucleotides to create a random integration of the CDRs as well as introduction of different CDRH3 loop sequences and lengths without disrupting the folding of the V regions (Griffiths et al., 1994)168). Semisynthetic libraries combine natural and synthetic antibody diversity. They are constructed from non-rearranged Vgenes from pre-B cells, or an antibody framework with randomization of the CDRH3 or several CDRs utilizing degenerated oligonucleotides (Valadon et al., 2019)(Barbas et al., 1992)(Rauchenberger et al., 2003)."

                            "ABSTRACT We describe here the design, construction and validation of ALTHEA Gold Libraries\u2122. These single-chain variable fragment (scFv), semisynthetic libraries are built on synthetic human well-known IGHV and IGKV germline genes combined with natural human complementarity-determining region (CDR)-H3/JH (H3J) fragments. One IGHV gene provided a universal VH scaffold and was paired with two IGKV scaffolds to furnish different topographies for binding distinct epitopes. The scaffolds were diversified at positions identified as in contact with antigens in the known antigen-antibody complex structures. The diversification regime consisted of high-usage amino acids found at those positions in human antibody sequences. Functionality, stability and diversity of the libraries were improved throughout a three-step construction process. In a first step, fully synthetic primary libraries were generated by combining the diversified scaffolds with a set of synthetic neutral H3J germline gene fragments. The second step consisted of selecting the primary libraries for enhanced thermostability based on the natural capacity of Protein A to bind the universal VH scaffold. In the third and final step, the resultant stable synthetic antibody fragments were combined with natural H3J fragments obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of a large pool of 200 donors. Validation of ALTHEA Gold Libraries\u2122 with seven targets yielded specific antibodies in all the cases. Further characterization of the isolated antibodies indicated KD values as human IgG1 molecules in the single-digit and sub-nM range. The thermal stability (Tm) of all the antigen-binding fragments was 75\u00b0C\u201380\u00b0C, demonstrating that ALTHEA Gold Libraries\u2122 are a valuable source of specific, high affinity and highly stable antibodies."

On the basis of the residues at key sites the 79 hypervariable regions can be assigned to one of 18 different canonical structures. We show that 71 of these hypervariable regions have a conformation that is very close to what can be defined as a \"standard\" conformation of each canonical structure. These standard conformations are described in detail. The other eight hypervariable regions have small deviations from the standard conformations that, in six cases, involve only the rotation of a single peptide group.

Ponsel and colleagues demonstrated that restricted diversity in CDR-H1 and CDR-H2 combined with highly variable CDR-H3 sequences improved library performance, yielding antibodies with affinities in the low nanomolar range <Paper corpusId=\"10576257\" paperTitle=\"(Ponsel et al., 2011)\" isShortName></Paper>.

                            "Among all the six CDR loops, the V H CDRs, especially V H 's CDR3 (CDRH3), are more frequently involved in the antigen binding than those in the light chain (Al-Lazikani et al., 1997)(Sela-Culang et al., 2012). The CDRH3 loop, which exists in a variety of different lengths (5-30 amino acids), is of particular importance due to its substantial impact on the canonical conformation and antigen binding compared to the other CDRs (Tsuchiya et al., 2016)(Chothia et al., 1989)(Chothia et al., 1987)(Shirai et al., 1999)(Kumar et al., 2019). Noteworthy, the loop length of CDRH3 does not only affect the specificity and affinity of the antibody for its specific antigen, but also affects the nature of the binding of other CDRs. Specifically, for antibodies with long CDRH3 loops, these loops are responsible for most of the antibody-antigen interactions, while in antibodies with short CDRH3 loops, other CDRs loops usually assist in antigen binding (Tsuchiya et al., 2016). Thus, CDRH3 plays a major role in recognizing diverse targets, and generating interactions with acceptable affinity (Xu et al., 2000)(Zadeh et al., 2019)",
                            "The diversity of the V-gene segments can be designed and synthesized artificially by CDRs randomization. These libraries can be fully synthetic or semisynthetic. Synthetic libraries are made to maximize antibodies' functionality by making a large and highly diverse phage repertoire. This is usually achieved in vitro by using PCR and oligonucleotides to create a random integration of the CDRs as well as introduction of different CDRH3 loop sequences and lengths without disrupting the folding of the V regions (Griffiths et al., 1994)168). Semisynthetic libraries combine natural and synthetic antibody diversity. They are constructed from non-rearranged Vgenes from pre-B cells, or an antibody framework with randomization of the CDRH3 or several CDRs utilizing degenerated oligonucleotides (Valadon et al., 2019)(Barbas et al., 1992)(Rauchenberger et al., 2003)."

This involves 79 hypervariable regions in all. We also analysed a part of the H3 region in 12 of the 15 VH domains considered here. On the basis of the residues at key sites the 79 hypervariable regions can be assigned to one of 18 different canonical structures. We show that 71 of these hypervariable regions have a conformation that is very close to what can be defined as a \"standard\" conformation of each canonical structure. These standard conformations are described in detail. The other eight hypervariable regions have small deviations from the standard conformations that, in six cases, involve only the rotation of a single peptide group. Most H3 hypervariable regions have the same conformation in the part that is close to the framework and the details of this conformation are also described here."

These include Fab complexes with lysozyme, two Fab complexes with influenza virus neuraminidase, and three Fab complexes with their anti-idiotype Fabs. The pattern of binding that emerges is similar to that found with other protein-protein interactions, with good shape complementarity between the interacting surfaces and reasonable juxtapositions of polar residues so as to permit hydrogen-bond formation. Water molecules have been observed in cavities within the interface and on the periphery, where they often form bridging hydrogen bonds between antibody and antigen. For the most part the antigen is bound in the middle of the antibody combining site with most of the six complementarity-determining residues involved in binding. For the most studied antigen, lysozyme, the epitopes for four antibodies occupy approximately 45% of the accessible surface area. Some conformational changes have been observed to accompany binding in both the antibody and the antigen, although most of the information on conformational change in the latter comes from studies of complexes with small antigens."

Different library generations were described and it could be shown that the restricted diversity in CDR-H1 and CDR-H2 improved the performance of the library whereas highly variable CDR-H3 sequences were advantageous. Affinities in the low nanomolar range were achieved using these libraries.\n\nHoet and coworkers at Dyax combined synthetic diversity in CDR-H1 and -H2 with length and sequence diversity in CDR-H3 from natural origin (Figure 3) [63]. CDR-H1 and -H2 repertoires were designed based on analysis of germlines genes with introduction of hot spot mutations. Those variable parts were constructed with codon-based oligonuceotides to avoid unwanted amino acids and stop codons, with the aim to increase the functional library size. VH3_23 was used as heavy chain acceptor and combined with the full lambda and kappa light chain repertoire. The natural diversity of the CDR-H3 and light chains originated from B-cells of 35 donors having various autoimmune diseases and 10 healthy donors in order to maximize the diversity. The light chain and all three heavy chain CDRs are independently replaceable modules to facilitate affinity maturation. From the phagemid Fab library with a size of 3.5 \u00d7 10 10 and a phage library with a size of 1.0 \u00d7 10 10 , affinities in the subnanomolar range were obtained."

The semisynthetic strategy has been refined further by grafting naturally occurring CDRs from human antibodies into frameworks based on well-behaved clinical antibodies, referred to as a Generation Three design [48], in order to address the identification of highly developable therapeutic antibodies directly from the library, CDR-H3 sequences were amplified directly from B cells, while the remaining CDRs were sourced from a large next-generation sequencing dataset and all sequence liabilities eliminated. The resulting scFv library is 9 \u00d7 10 9 in size with the CDR diversity incorporated into 4 VH frameworks, 3 V\u03ba frameworks, and 1 V\u03bb framework [48]",
                            "One avenue of refining synthetic library design has been to take a minimalist strategy and decrease randomization by using a single framework with a binary code to diversify the CDR-H3. In one such study, Tyr and Ser were selected as these have been found to be highly abundant in antibody binding sites [52]",
                            "However, a glycine residue in the CDR-H3 was determined to be critical for the paratope conformation enabling high affinity binding",
                            "Thus, the minimalist synthetic CDR-H3 library strategy was explored further to generate antibodies with therapeutic potential [55]. Trinucleotide synthesis technology [56] was employed to introduce approx. equal quantities of all amino acids at each engineered position (other than cysteine) in order to evaluate the contribution of amino acid classes to antibody function. Therefore, libraries were constructed on a single framework scaffold, the clinically validated DP47 heavy chain and DP-K22 light chain, with either randomization of the CDR-H3 alone or the CDR-H3 and CDR-L3 and included incorporation of a range of loop lengths (in equal proportions rather than the parabolic distribution seen with the natural human antibody repertoire)",
                            "It was observed that loop length and CDR-H3 stem composition (potentially stabilizing the loop) played a key role in the functional output, whereas diversification of CDR-L3 was not essential for library performance",

                            "The diversities of the CDR2 and CDR3 sequences were designed to take into account important characteristics regarding the amino acids placed in the CDR regions. The composition of the CDR loops may have a significant influence on the antibody aggregation propensity. This is important to take into consideration when creating diversity for synthetic libraries as the natural selection in the immune cells is absent and the risk of aggregation of antibody clones might thus be increased. Propensities for aggregation were taken into account in the design of the CDR2 diversity, based on previously published work of the amino acid composition in CDR2 [6]. Generally the use of the most hydrophobic amino acids (i.e. V, I, L, M, and F) was kept at a moderate to low level (with a 0-25% likelihood of a hydrophobic amino acid at any given randomized position). This was done to lower the overall hydrophobicity of the CDRs thereby reducing the risk of aggregation [6], while at the same time allowing hydrophobic contributions to the antigen binding. Additional favorable contributions to binding, documented for tyrosine, serine and glycine, were taken into account in the design of both the CDR2 and CDR3 [40]. Positively charged amino acids were omitted or kept at very low frequencies for CDR2 and CDR3 respectively, as a high frequency of these have been linked to promotion of poly-reactivity (lack of specificity) and increased nucleic acid binding of the antibodies [16]40]. The CDR2 was designed to have a low diversity by limited randomization of only four positions (Figure 3). This entails that the overall diversity is minimized, thus ensuring that the total library diversity can be sampled in the phage display system. Due to the genetic rearrangements underlying the natural immune repertoire it is the CDR3 loop in the antibody repertoire which displays the highest diversity. Therefore the CDR3 loop in Predator library was designed to take this into account by randomizing seven positions."

But, several technical challenges are associated with the selection process. For instance, during the panning step, the successful elution of the phages bound to the antigen is critical in order to avoid losing the most promising binders. Here, we present an efficient protocol to establish, screen and select synthetic libraries of domain antibodies using phage display. We do not only present suitable solutions to the above-mentioned challenges to improve elution by 50-fold, but we also present a step by step in-depth protocol with miniaturized volumes and optimized procedures to save material, costs and time for a successful phage display with domain antibodies. Hence, this protocol improves the selection process for an efficient handling process. The here presented library is based on the variable domain (vNAR) of the naturally occurring novel antibody receptor (IgNAR) from cartilage fishes. Diversity was introduced in the Complementarity-Determining Region 3 (CDR3) of the antigen-binding site with different composition and length."

                "tldr": "CDR-L3, while less diverse than CDR-H3, significantly impacts antibody binding characteristics through its interaction with CDR-H3 and provides opportunities for affinity maturation. Its structure, composition, and loop length contribute to paratope stability and binding specificity, with strategic diversification approaches employing restricted diversity at key positions to optimize both binding affinity and biophysical properties. (13 sources)",
                "text": "\nWhile CDR-H3 is often considered the centerpiece of antigen binding, CDR-L3 makes significant contributions to antibody diversity and function through several mechanisms. In phage display libraries, CDR-L3 offers substantial diversity, with modern synthetic libraries incorporating CDR-L3 regions featuring 3-7 degenerate codons that can encode nine different amino acids, providing a theoretical diversity on the order of 10^7 unique sequences <Paper corpusId=\"230675934\" paperTitle=\"(Kelil et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. This diversity, though less extensive than CDR-H3, remains crucial for expanding the functional repertoire of antibody libraries.\n\nThe structural characteristics of CDR-L3 influence binding properties in distinct ways. Compared to CDR-H3, CDR-L3 exhibits more restricted conformational diversity, particularly in kappa light chains where the loop is relatively rigid, compared to lambda light chains which display greater flexibility <Paper corpusId=\"20900714\" paperTitle=\"(Tiller et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper>. This structural difference between kappa and lambda light chains can affect antibody behavior, with some evidence suggesting that lambda CDR-L3 flexibility may contribute to increased aggregation propensity in certain antibody formats <Paper corpusId=\"20900714\" paperTitle=\"(Tiller et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nCDR-L3 directly influences antigen binding through its interaction with CDR-H3. Molecular dynamics studies have shown that CDR-L3 forms important stabilizing contacts with CDR-H3, contributing to paratope stability <Paper corpusId=\"257534341\" paperTitle=\"(Pomarici et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. The amino acid composition at specific positions within CDR-L3 can significantly affect these interactions. For instance, an arginine at the third position of CDR-L3 has been observed to form more interactions with CDR-H3 than when tyrosine or serine occupies the same position, potentially enhancing paratope stability <Paper corpusId=\"257534341\" paperTitle=\"(Pomarici et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"41464642\" paperTitle=\"(Giles et al., 2003)\" isShortName></Paper>. This aligns with broader observations that arginine residues in CDRs can be critical determinants of antibody affinity <Paper corpusId=\"8032988\" paperTitle=\"(Giles et al._1, 2003)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nCDR-L3 diversification provides significant opportunities for affinity maturation. In some cases, libraries focusing on CDR-L3 diversification have yielded more affinity-improved variants than corresponding CDR-H3 libraries, particularly when the parental CDR-H3 is already near-optimal <Paper corpusId=\"11913189\" paperTitle=\"(Ko et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>. For example, one study demonstrated that CDR-L3 libraries under mild selection pressure produced diverse clones with improved binding characteristics, where high-stringency selection conditions facilitated isolation of affinity-matured variants with specific amino acid preferences, such as hydrophobic residues at position 91L, small amino acids at 92L, and aromatic amino acids at 93L <Paper corpusId=\"11913189\" paperTitle=\"(Ko et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe design of CDR-L3 diversity in synthetic libraries requires careful consideration of amino acid composition to balance binding potential with biophysical properties. Library designers often limit hydrophobic amino acids in CDR-L3 to reduce aggregation risk while incorporating favorable binding contributors like tyrosine, serine, and glycine <Paper corpusId=\"16251643\" paperTitle=\"(Mandrup et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper>. Positively charged amino acids are typically omitted or kept at very low frequencies to prevent polyreactivity and non-specific nucleic acid binding <Paper corpusId=\"16251643\" paperTitle=\"(Mandrup et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nModern antibody library designs have evolved sophisticated approaches to CDR-L3 diversification. The HuCAL Gold\u2122 library refined its design strategy to extend diversity to CDR-L3 while accurately reflecting canonical structures found in natural antibody families, consciously incorporating structures known to be preferred for peptide recognition <Paper corpusId=\"16807254\" paperTitle=\"(Finlay et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"15340484\" paperTitle=\"(Knappik et al., 2000)\" isShortName></Paper>. Other approaches, such as the n-CoDer\u2122 library, have grafted naturally occurring CDR-L3 sequences from human antibodies into frameworks based on well-behaved clinical antibodies <Paper corpusId=\"270629223\" paperTitle=\"(Hutchings et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe importance of CDR-L3 loop length has also been recognized, with evidence suggesting that it influences VH-antigen interactions <Paper corpusId=\"270629223\" paperTitle=\"(Hutchings et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. Loop length variation represents a valid strategy for affinity maturation, as it simultaneously influences tertiary structure and binding activity <Paper corpusId=\"257534341\" paperTitle=\"(Pomarici et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"46100746\" paperTitle=\"(Clark et al., 2008)\" isShortName></Paper>. However, some library designs have found that while CDR-L3 diversification is useful, it is not always essential for library performance, with both loop length and CDR-H3 stem composition playing more decisive roles in functional outcomes <Paper corpusId=\"270629223\" paperTitle=\"(Hutchings et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nIn practice, CDR-L3 optimization can be implemented in sequential or combinatorial approaches. Some studies have demonstrated success by first identifying beneficial mutations in separate CDR-H3 and CDR-L3 libraries, then combining these mutations to achieve synergistic improvements in binding affinity <Paper corpusId=\"9629900\" paperTitle=\"(Moon et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"23024981\" paperTitle=\"(Schier et al., 1996)\" isShortName></Paper>. This strategy has produced antibodies with dramatically increased affinity compared to wild-type variants, suggesting that combined optimization of CDR-H3 and CDR-L3 can be particularly efficient for enhancing antibody performance <Paper corpusId=\"23024981\" paperTitle=\"(Schier et al., 1996)\" isShortName></Paper>.",

                            "Interestingly, this difference observed following selection on a target had not been present in the initially tested 100 VH/VL pairs, indicating a potential influence of the selected CDR3s. Regarding monomer content, the behavior of the 36 VH/VL framework pairs (not more than 2% aggregates) is largely preserved in the VH/V\u03ba IgG1 output from phage pannings. As already discussed above for VH/V\u03bb pairs containing V\u03bb3-1, they seem to be more prone to aggregation. An explanation for this increased aggregation tendency may be found in the relatively flexible V\u03bb CDR-L3 compared with more rigid V\u03ba CDR-L3 sequence compositions. (Tomlinsonl et al., 1995)(Luo et al., 2010)(Kuroda et al., 2009) evertheless, the majority of the antigen-selected antibody molecules closely preserved the biophysical features that were characteristic of the corresponding \"parental\" VH/VL framework pair. Slight biophysical deviations were observed only in a minority of selected binders and thus have to be attributed to the influence of the particular CDR-L3 and CDR-H3 sequences. While such effects remain difficult to circumvent without abating overall CDR3 diversity, a very good balance between biophysically optimal and diverse VH/VL pairs has been obtained after phage selections."

                            "Comparing the CDR loops interactions in the different systems, it is evident that the LC germlines present in the most stable Fabs (L3-11 and L1-39) are also the ones in which the paratope is highly stabilized. Focusing on the CDR-H3/CDR-L3 interactions, when an Arg is present as third residue of the CDR-L3 loop, as in the germline L3-11, it forms more interactions with the CDR-H3 loop rather than when a Tyr or a Ser is in the same position (Fig. 2a). As previously discussed in literature, Arg located in the CDR loops, is a critical determinant for affinity (Giles et al., 2003)(Giles et al., 2003)(Birtalan et al., 2008). In this case, it seems that this residue may play an important role in the stabilization of the CDR-H3 loop, too. \n\nThe CDR-L1 and the CDR-L2 loops also interact with the CDR-H3 loop, even if their contacts are less occurrent than the ones between CDR-L3 and CDR-H3 loop (SI Fig. 7). In our dataset, CDR-L1 loops show quite some differences in sequence and length, whereas CDR-L2 loops share the same length but differ in sequence. Loop length variation is proven to be a valid strategy for affinity maturation of antibodies, since it influences tertiary structure and activity simultaneously (Brockmann et al., 2020)(Clark et al., 2008). However, an enhancement in affinity does not always go hand in hand with a higher stability. In our dataset, for example, the two germlines with longer CDR-L1 loops, L3-20 and L4-1 (respectively 12 and 17 AA) show only few stabilizing contacts with the CDR-H3 loop. Instead, the L1-39 germline, which is also the most stable one, makes the highest number of interactions (SI Fig. 7a)."

                            "OBJECTIVE\nPrevious studies have suggested the importance of somatic mutations and certain residues in the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) implicated in the pathogenesis of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS). The authors tested this hypothesis by carrying out a systematic analysis of all published aPL sequences.\n\n\nMETHODS\nEach aPL variable region sequence was aligned to the closest germline counterpart in the VBASE Sequence Directory by using DNAPLOT software, allowing analysis of nucleotide homology and distribution of somatic mutations. The probability that this distribution arose as a result of antigen-driven accumulation of replacement mutations in the CDRs was tested statistically.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere was no preferential gene or family use in the 36 aPL sequences identified. Immunoglobulin (Ig) M aPL had few somatic mutations compared with IgG. Of the IgG aPL, 9 of 14 showed evidence of antigen-driven accumulation of replacement mutations in the CDRs. Multinomial analysis allowed a clearer statistical identification of sequences that had been subject to antigen drive. The more specific IgM aPL and some IgG aPL displayed an accumulation of arginine, asparagine, and lysine residues in CDRs.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nHigh-specificity binding in IgG aPL, but not in more specific IgM aPL, is conferred by antigen-driven somatic mutation. This may in part be caused by an accumulation of arginine, asparagine, and lysine residues in the CDRs, which are germlines encoded in the more specific IgM aPL, but often arise because of somatic mutation in IgG aPL.\n\n\nRELEVANCE\nAn understanding of the role of arginine, asparagine, and lysine residues in the binding of pathogenic aPL to phospholipids, and to beta(2)-glycoprotein I, may eventually help in the development of drugs to interfere with those interactions, and thereby improve the treatment of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome."

                            "Previously we reported that the variable heavy chain region (VH) of a human beta2 glycoprotein I-dependent monoclonal antiphospholipid antibody (IS4) was dominant in conferring the ability to bind cardiolipin (CL). In contrast, the identity of the paired variable light chain region (VL) determined the strength of CL binding. In the present study, we examine the importance of specific arginine residues in IS4VH and paired VL in CL binding. The distribution of arginine residues in complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of VH and VL sequences was altered by site-directed mutagenesis or by CDR exchange. Ten different 2a2 germline gene-derived VL sequences were expressed with IS4VH and the VH of an anti-dsDNA antibody, B3. Six variants of IS4VH, containing different patterns of arginine residues in CDR3, were paired with B3VL and IS4VL. The ability of the 32 expressed heavy chain/light chain combinations to bind CL was determined by ELISA. Of four arginine residues in IS4VH CDR3 substituted to serines, two residues at positions 100 and 100 g had a major influence on the strength of CL binding while the two residues at positions 96 and 97 had no effect. In CDR exchange studies, VL containing B3VL CDR1 were associated with elevated CL binding, which was reduced significantly by substitution of a CDR1 arginine residue at position 27a with serine. In contrast, arginine residues in VL CDR2 or VL CDR3 did not enhance CL binding, and in one case may have contributed to inhibition of this binding. Subsets of arginine residues at specific locations in the CDRs of heavy chains and light chains of pathogenic antiphospholipid antibodies are important in determining their ability to bind CL."

It is probable that the CDR-H3 of hz1E11 is already close to optimal and most mutations, especially in the region 97 H -100 H , are deleterious to the binding affinity, while the CDR-L3 sequence is not as optimal and the mutation in this region can result in significant improvement in the affinity. The L-NNK library panning outputs were enriched with clones with a hydrophobic amino acid at the position 91 L , a small amino acid at 92 L , and an aromatic amino acid at 93 L . This pattern is somewhat different from the parental CDR-L3 sequence of Q 89L QLYSTPWT 97L and again suggests that the CDR-L3 sequence of the parental 1E11 antibody was sub-optimal and thus had room for affinity improvement",
                            "Milder selection pressure favored the selection of more diverse clones, whereas higher selection stringency resulted in the convergence of the panning output to a smaller number of clones with improved affinity",

                            "The diversities of the CDR2 and CDR3 sequences were designed to take into account important characteristics regarding the amino acids placed in the CDR regions. The composition of the CDR loops may have a significant influence on the antibody aggregation propensity. This is important to take into consideration when creating diversity for synthetic libraries as the natural selection in the immune cells is absent and the risk of aggregation of antibody clones might thus be increased. Propensities for aggregation were taken into account in the design of the CDR2 diversity, based on previously published work of the amino acid composition in CDR2 [6]. Generally the use of the most hydrophobic amino acids (i.e. V, I, L, M, and F) was kept at a moderate to low level (with a 0-25% likelihood of a hydrophobic amino acid at any given randomized position). This was done to lower the overall hydrophobicity of the CDRs thereby reducing the risk of aggregation [6], while at the same time allowing hydrophobic contributions to the antigen binding. Additional favorable contributions to binding, documented for tyrosine, serine and glycine, were taken into account in the design of both the CDR2 and CDR3 [40]. Positively charged amino acids were omitted or kept at very low frequencies for CDR2 and CDR3 respectively, as a high frequency of these have been linked to promotion of poly-reactivity (lack of specificity) and increased nucleic acid binding of the antibodies [16]40]. The CDR2 was designed to have a low diversity by limited randomization of only four positions (Figure 3). This entails that the overall diversity is minimized, thus ensuring that the total library diversity can be sampled in the phage display system. Due to the genetic rearrangements underlying the natural immune repertoire it is the CDR3 loop in the antibody repertoire which displays the highest diversity. Therefore the CDR3 loop in Predator library was designed to take this into account by randomizing seven positions."

This repertoire design was highly effective in generating nM-affinity clones with specificity for a selection of proteins and peptides (Knappik et al., 2000)(Marget et al., 2000). \n\nThe methods used by (Knappik et al., 2000) have since been elaborated upon in a number of reports. (Rothe et al., 2008), reported the construction of the next-generation library HuCal Gold\u2122 in which the design strategy was refined to change the CDR design complexity, the structural format of the library (to Fab fragment) and also to move to \"CysDisplay\" in which the expressed antibody is tethered to the phage via a disulphide bond with a mutant p3 protein. In this library, the CDR diversity was extended to the CDRs 1 and 2 of both V-domains, in addition to the CDR3s. The CDR cassettes were again based on trinucleotide technology and were built to accurately reflect the canonical structures and diversity found in the families upon which each of the consensus frameworks were built, consciously including structures known to be preferred in the recognition of peptides."

A consensus sequence was derived for each family and optimized for expression in Escherichia coli. In order to make all six complementarity determining regions (CDRs) accessible for diversification, the synthetic genes were designed to be modular and mutually compatible by introducing unique restriction endonuclease sites flanking the CDRs. Molecular modeling verified that all canonical classes were present. We could show that all master genes are expressed as soluble proteins in the periplasm of E. coli. A first set of antibody phage display libraries totalling 2x10(9) members was created after cloning the genes in all 49 combinations into a phagemid vector, itself devoid of the restriction sites in question. Diversity was created by replacing the V(H) and V(L) CDR3 regions of the master genes by CDR3 library cassettes, generated from mixed trinucleotides and biased towards natural human antibody CDR3 sequences. The sequencing of 257 members of the unselected libraries indicated that the frequency of correct and thus potentially functional sequences was 61 %. Selection experiments against many antigens yielded a diverse set of binders with high affinities. Due to the modular design of all master genes, either single binders or even pools of binders can now be rapidly optimized without knowledge of the particular sequence, using pre-built CDR cassette libraries. The small number of 49 master genes will allow future improvements to be incorporated quickly, and the separation of the frameworks may help in analyzing why nature has evolved these distinct subfamilies of antibody germline genes."

The semisynthetic strategy has been refined further by grafting naturally occurring CDRs from human antibodies into frameworks based on well-behaved clinical antibodies, referred to as a Generation Three design [48], in order to address the identification of highly developable therapeutic antibodies directly from the library, CDR-H3 sequences were amplified directly from B cells, while the remaining CDRs were sourced from a large next-generation sequencing dataset and all sequence liabilities eliminated. The resulting scFv library is 9 \u00d7 10 9 in size with the CDR diversity incorporated into 4 VH frameworks, 3 V\u03ba frameworks, and 1 V\u03bb framework [48]",
                            "One avenue of refining synthetic library design has been to take a minimalist strategy and decrease randomization by using a single framework with a binary code to diversify the CDR-H3. In one such study, Tyr and Ser were selected as these have been found to be highly abundant in antibody binding sites [52]",
                            "However, a glycine residue in the CDR-H3 was determined to be critical for the paratope conformation enabling high affinity binding",
                            "Thus, the minimalist synthetic CDR-H3 library strategy was explored further to generate antibodies with therapeutic potential [55]. Trinucleotide synthesis technology [56] was employed to introduce approx. equal quantities of all amino acids at each engineered position (other than cysteine) in order to evaluate the contribution of amino acid classes to antibody function. Therefore, libraries were constructed on a single framework scaffold, the clinically validated DP47 heavy chain and DP-K22 light chain, with either randomization of the CDR-H3 alone or the CDR-H3 and CDR-L3 and included incorporation of a range of loop lengths (in equal proportions rather than the parabolic distribution seen with the natural human antibody repertoire)",
                            "It was observed that loop length and CDR-H3 stem composition (potentially stabilizing the loop) played a key role in the functional output, whereas diversification of CDR-L3 was not essential for library performance",

                            "A design approach was taken to investigate the feasibility of replacing single complementarity determining region (CDR) antibody loops. This approach may complement simpler mutation-based strategies for rational antibody design by expanding conformation space. Enormous crystal structure diversity is available, making CDR loops logical targets for structure-based design. A detailed analysis for the L1 loop shows that each loop length takes a distinct conformation, thereby allowing control on a length scale beyond that accessible to simple mutations. The L1 loop in the anti-VLA1 antibody was replaced with the L2 loop residues longer in an attempt to add an additional hydrogen bond and fill space on the antibody-antigen interface. The designs expressed well, but failed to improve affinity. In an effort to learn more, one design was crystallized and data were collected at 1.9 A resolution. The designed L1 loop takes the qualitatively desired conformation; confirming that loop replacement by design is feasible. The crystal structure also shows that the outermost loop (residues Leu51-Ser68) is domain swapped with another monomer. Tryptophan fluorescence measurements were used to monitor unfolding as a function of temperature and indicate that the loop involved in domain swapping does not unfold below 60 degrees C. The domain-swapping is not directly responsible for the affinity loss, but is likely a side-effect of the structural instability which may contribute to affinity loss. A second round of design was successful in eliminating the dimerization through mutation of a residue (Leu51Ser) at the joint of the domain-swapped loop."

In addition, because it has been reported that binding affinity can be increased by a combination of mutations isolated from separate libraries (Schier et al., 1996), we randomized the residues within either CDR-H3 or CDR-L3, panned each library, and selected the variants based on their anti-cancer activities. Then, the selected variants were cloned into the expression vectors pOptiVEC (for heavy chain expression) or pcDNA3.3 (for light chain expression). An additional diverse antibody repertoire was achieved by a combination of heavy and light chains, and the resulting IgG antibodies with substituted residues in both the heavy and light chains were expressed in CHO-S cells and finally evaluated on their anti-cancer activity (step-by-step screening scheme, Fig. 2)."

CDR3 of the light (V(L)) and heavy (V(H)) chain variable region of C6.5 were sequentially mutated, the mutant scFv displayed on phage, and higher affinity mutants selected on antigen. Mutation of V(L) CDR3 yielded a scFv (C6ML3-9) with a 16-fold lower Kd (1.0 x 10(-9) M) than C6.5. Due to its length of 20 amino acids, four V(H) CDR3 libraries of C6ML3-9 were constructed. The greatest increase in affinity from a single library was ninefold (Kd = 1.1 x 10(-10) M). Combination of mutations isolated from separate V(H) CDR3 libraries yielded additional ninefold decreases in Kd, resulting in a scFv with a 1230-fold increase in affinity from wild-type C6.5 (Kd = 1.3 x 10(-11) M). The increase in affinity, and its absolute value, are comparable to the largest values observed for antibody affinity maturation in vivo or in vitro and indicate that mutation of V(L) and V(H) CDR3 may be a particularly efficient means to increase antibody affinity. This result, combined with the location of amino acid conservation and substitution, suggests an overall strategy for in vitro antibody affinity maturation. In addition, the affinities and binding kinetics of the single-chain Fv provide reagents with potential tumor targeting abilities not previously available."

Strategic engineering of these interactions can enhance bispecific antibody production and therapeutic performance by promoting proper heavy-light chain pairing and optimizing binding properties.

                "text": "\nThe interplay between CDR-H3 and CDR-L3 forms a crucial structural foundation for antibody function, with molecular studies revealing that these two regions contain the most interfacing residues among all CDRs. Despite their high sequence variability\u2014CDR-H3 and CDR-L3 displaying only 11.1% and 23.3% sequence identity, respectively\u2014they contribute over 15% of the overall heavy chain/light chain (HC/LC) interaction <Paper corpusId=\"230657571\" paperTitle=\"(Gong et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. This significant contribution to the HC/LC interface suggests that certain CDR-H3/CDR-L3 pairings may be more favorable than others, potentially influencing the initial assembly of the quaternary antibody structure as the VH/VL interaction is reportedly the first step in this process <Paper corpusId=\"230657571\" paperTitle=\"(Gong et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe specific amino acid composition at the CDR-H3/CDR-L3 interface plays a determinative role in stabilizing the paratope. Molecular dynamics studies have shown that when arginine is present as the third residue of the CDR-L3 loop, it forms more extensive interactions with CDR-H3 than when tyrosine or serine occupies the same position <Paper corpusId=\"257534341\" paperTitle=\"(Pomarici et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This aligns with previous findings that arginine residues in CDRs can be critical determinants for antibody affinity <Paper corpusId=\"257534341\" paperTitle=\"(Pomarici et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"41464642\" paperTitle=\"(Giles et al., 2003)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"8032988\" paperTitle=\"(Giles et al._1, 2003)\" isShortName></Paper>. The stabilizing interactions between CDR-L3 and CDR-H3 appear to be more prevalent than those between CDR-L1 or CDR-L2 and CDR-H3, highlighting the particular importance of the CDR-L3/CDR-H3 interface <Paper corpusId=\"257534341\" paperTitle=\"(Pomarici et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe engineering of CDR-H3/CDR-L3 interactions has found practical application in the development of bispecific antibodies. Joshi and colleagues demonstrated that CDR-L3 and CDR-H3 can make critical contributions to the yield of bispecific antibodies <Paper corpusId=\"246388057\" paperTitle=\"(Fernandez-Quintero et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. In their experiments, transplanting CDR-L3 and CDR-H3 sequences from antibodies with strong HC/LC pairing preferences into antibody pairs with no pairing preference substantially increased bispecific antibody yield\u2014from approximately 24% up to 40-65% in several cases <Paper corpusId=\"195845325\" paperTitle=\"(Joshi et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. This finding suggests that specific residues within CDR-H3 and CDR-L3 can impart pairing preference for some antibody pairs, though the effect is not universal across all antibodies <Paper corpusId=\"195845325\" paperTitle=\"(Joshi et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe relative importance of CDR-H3/CDR-L3 interactions has also been examined in the context of library design. Studies with minimalist synthetic libraries have shown that while CDR-H3 loop length and stem composition play key roles in functional outcomes, diversification of CDR-L3 is not always essential for library performance <Paper corpusId=\"270629223\" paperTitle=\"(Hutchings et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. However, the influence of CDR-L3 on VH-antigen interactions has been documented, with evidence that CDR-L3 loop length can affect how the heavy chain interacts with antigens <Paper corpusId=\"270629223\" paperTitle=\"(Hutchings et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. This suggests that while CDR-H3 may be the primary determinant of binding specificity, CDR-L3 provides an important structural context that modulates this specificity.\n\nThe interaction between CDR-H3 and CDR-L3 can also be influenced by loop length variations. Such variations represent a valid strategy for affinity maturation since they simultaneously affect tertiary structure and binding activity <Paper corpusId=\"257534341\" paperTitle=\"(Pomarici et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"46100746\" paperTitle=\"(Clark et al., 2008)\" isShortName></Paper>. However, it's important to note that enhanced affinity does not always correlate with higher stability, as demonstrated by studies showing that some light chain germlines with longer CDR-L1 loops make fewer stabilizing contacts with CDR-H3 <Paper corpusId=\"257534341\" paperTitle=\"(Pomarici et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nIn summary, the CDR-H3/CDR-L3 interface represents a critical determinant of antibody structure and function. Strategic engineering of this interface can enhance bispecific antibody production and optimize therapeutic performance by promoting proper heavy-light chain pairing and fine-tuning binding properties. The complementary roles of these two CDRs highlight the importance of considering their interaction when designing antibody libraries for phage display.",

                            "Comparing the CDR loops interactions in the different systems, it is evident that the LC germlines present in the most stable Fabs (L3-11 and L1-39) are also the ones in which the paratope is highly stabilized. Focusing on the CDR-H3/CDR-L3 interactions, when an Arg is present as third residue of the CDR-L3 loop, as in the germline L3-11, it forms more interactions with the CDR-H3 loop rather than when a Tyr or a Ser is in the same position (Fig. 2a). As previously discussed in literature, Arg located in the CDR loops, is a critical determinant for affinity (Giles et al., 2003)(Giles et al., 2003)(Birtalan et al., 2008). In this case, it seems that this residue may play an important role in the stabilization of the CDR-H3 loop, too. \n\nThe CDR-L1 and the CDR-L2 loops also interact with the CDR-H3 loop, even if their contacts are less occurrent than the ones between CDR-L3 and CDR-H3 loop (SI Fig. 7). In our dataset, CDR-L1 loops show quite some differences in sequence and length, whereas CDR-L2 loops share the same length but differ in sequence. Loop length variation is proven to be a valid strategy for affinity maturation of antibodies, since it influences tertiary structure and activity simultaneously (Brockmann et al., 2020)(Clark et al., 2008). However, an enhancement in affinity does not always go hand in hand with a higher stability. In our dataset, for example, the two germlines with longer CDR-L1 loops, L3-20 and L4-1 (respectively 12 and 17 AA) show only few stabilizing contacts with the CDR-H3 loop. Instead, the L1-39 germline, which is also the most stable one, makes the highest number of interactions (SI Fig. 7a)."

                            "OBJECTIVE\nPrevious studies have suggested the importance of somatic mutations and certain residues in the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) implicated in the pathogenesis of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS). The authors tested this hypothesis by carrying out a systematic analysis of all published aPL sequences.\n\n\nMETHODS\nEach aPL variable region sequence was aligned to the closest germline counterpart in the VBASE Sequence Directory by using DNAPLOT software, allowing analysis of nucleotide homology and distribution of somatic mutations. The probability that this distribution arose as a result of antigen-driven accumulation of replacement mutations in the CDRs was tested statistically.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere was no preferential gene or family use in the 36 aPL sequences identified. Immunoglobulin (Ig) M aPL had few somatic mutations compared with IgG. Of the IgG aPL, 9 of 14 showed evidence of antigen-driven accumulation of replacement mutations in the CDRs. Multinomial analysis allowed a clearer statistical identification of sequences that had been subject to antigen drive. The more specific IgM aPL and some IgG aPL displayed an accumulation of arginine, asparagine, and lysine residues in CDRs.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nHigh-specificity binding in IgG aPL, but not in more specific IgM aPL, is conferred by antigen-driven somatic mutation. This may in part be caused by an accumulation of arginine, asparagine, and lysine residues in the CDRs, which are germlines encoded in the more specific IgM aPL, but often arise because of somatic mutation in IgG aPL.\n\n\nRELEVANCE\nAn understanding of the role of arginine, asparagine, and lysine residues in the binding of pathogenic aPL to phospholipids, and to beta(2)-glycoprotein I, may eventually help in the development of drugs to interfere with those interactions, and thereby improve the treatment of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome."

                            "Previously we reported that the variable heavy chain region (VH) of a human beta2 glycoprotein I-dependent monoclonal antiphospholipid antibody (IS4) was dominant in conferring the ability to bind cardiolipin (CL). In contrast, the identity of the paired variable light chain region (VL) determined the strength of CL binding. In the present study, we examine the importance of specific arginine residues in IS4VH and paired VL in CL binding. The distribution of arginine residues in complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of VH and VL sequences was altered by site-directed mutagenesis or by CDR exchange. Ten different 2a2 germline gene-derived VL sequences were expressed with IS4VH and the VH of an anti-dsDNA antibody, B3. Six variants of IS4VH, containing different patterns of arginine residues in CDR3, were paired with B3VL and IS4VL. The ability of the 32 expressed heavy chain/light chain combinations to bind CL was determined by ELISA. Of four arginine residues in IS4VH CDR3 substituted to serines, two residues at positions 100 and 100 g had a major influence on the strength of CL binding while the two residues at positions 96 and 97 had no effect. In CDR exchange studies, VL containing B3VL CDR1 were associated with elevated CL binding, which was reduced significantly by substitution of a CDR1 arginine residue at position 27a with serine. In contrast, arginine residues in VL CDR2 or VL CDR3 did not enhance CL binding, and in one case may have contributed to inhibition of this binding. Subsets of arginine residues at specific locations in the CDRs of heavy chains and light chains of pathogenic antiphospholipid antibodies are important in determining their ability to bind CL."

Next, we investigated whether CDR L3 and H3 from these antibodies could be sufficient for providing high bispecific yield for other antibody pairs. We selected two antibody pairs that have low bispecific yield, namely anti-HER2/CD3 (22-24%) (Table 1) (Dillon et al., 2016) and anti-VEGFA/ANG2 (24%). (Dillon et al., 2016) CDR L3 and H3 for one arm each of these two BsIgG 1 were replaced with corresponding CDR sequences from either the anti-MET or anti-IL-13 antibodies. A substantial increase in yield of BsIgG 1 (from ~24% up to 40-65%) was observed in three of four CDR L3 and H3 recruitment cases for both anti-HER2/CD3 (Figure 7(a)) and anti-VEGFA/ANG2 (Figure 7 (b)). Thus, recruitment of CDR L3 and H3 from antibodies with a cognate HC/LC pairing preference can enhance the yield of BsIgG 1 with no pairing preference but does not invariably do so",

Together, these results suggested that CDR L3 and H3 can impart pairing preference for some, but not all, antibody pairs."

The semisynthetic strategy has been refined further by grafting naturally occurring CDRs from human antibodies into frameworks based on well-behaved clinical antibodies, referred to as a Generation Three design [48], in order to address the identification of highly developable therapeutic antibodies directly from the library, CDR-H3 sequences were amplified directly from B cells, while the remaining CDRs were sourced from a large next-generation sequencing dataset and all sequence liabilities eliminated.

Therefore, libraries were constructed on a single framework scaffold, the clinically validated DP47 heavy chain and DP-K22 light chain, with either randomization of the CDR-H3 alone or the CDR-H3 and CDR-L3 and included incorporation of a range of loop lengths (in equal proportions rather than the parabolic distribution seen with the natural human antibody repertoire)",

                            "A design approach was taken to investigate the feasibility of replacing single complementarity determining region (CDR) antibody loops. This approach may complement simpler mutation-based strategies for rational antibody design by expanding conformation space. Enormous crystal structure diversity is available, making CDR loops logical targets for structure-based design. A detailed analysis for the L1 loop shows that each loop length takes a distinct conformation, thereby allowing control on a length scale beyond that accessible to simple mutations. The L1 loop in the anti-VLA1 antibody was replaced with the L2 loop residues longer in an attempt to add an additional hydrogen bond and fill space on the antibody-antigen interface. The designs expressed well, but failed to improve affinity. In an effort to learn more, one design was crystallized and data were collected at 1.9 A resolution. The designed L1 loop takes the qualitatively desired conformation; confirming that loop replacement by design is feasible. The crystal structure also shows that the outermost loop (residues Leu51-Ser68) is domain swapped with another monomer. Tryptophan fluorescence measurements were used to monitor unfolding as a function of temperature and indicate that the loop involved in domain swapping does not unfold below 60 degrees C. The domain-swapping is not directly responsible for the affinity loss, but is likely a side-effect of the structural instability which may contribute to affinity loss. A second round of design was successful in eliminating the dimerization through mutation of a residue (Leu51Ser) at the joint of the domain-swapped loop."

Natural antibody repertoires show a distinct bias toward certain amino acids in CDRs, particularly tyrosine, glycine, and serine, despite the theoretical potential for hypervariability <Paper corpusId=\"11736660\" paperTitle=\"(Lobner et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>. This compositional bias has informed synthetic library design strategies, with some minimalist approaches demonstrating that libraries containing only tyrosine and serine in their CDRs can successfully generate specific antibodies against various antigens <Paper corpusId=\"11736660\" paperTitle=\"(Lobner et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"246433314\" paperTitle=\"(Davydova, 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. However, subsequent research has revealed that incorporating glycine is critical for enabling proper paratope conformation and high-affinity binding <Paper corpusId=\"270629223\" paperTitle=\"(Hutchings et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nWhen designing synthetic antibody libraries, developers carefully restrict certain amino acid types to optimize both binding function and biophysical properties. Hydrophobic amino acids (valine, isoleucine, leucine, methionine, and phenylalanine) are typically kept at moderate to low levels (0-25% likelihood at any randomized position) to reduce the risk of antibody aggregation while still allowing for hydrophobic contributions to antigen binding <Paper corpusId=\"16251643\" paperTitle=\"(Mandrup et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper>. Similarly, positively charged amino acids are often omitted or maintained at very low frequencies, particularly in CDR-H3 and CDR-L3, as these have been linked to increased polyreactivity and non-specific nucleic acid binding <Paper corpusId=\"16251643\" paperTitle=\"(Mandrup et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nModern library design approaches utilize sophisticated diversification techniques to optimize amino acid composition. Trinucleotide synthesis technology allows for precise control over amino acid distributions at specific positions, enabling library designers to accurately reflect the canonical structures and diversity found in natural antibody families <Paper corpusId=\"16807254\" paperTitle=\"(Finlay et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"15340484\" paperTitle=\"(Knappik et al., 2000)\" isShortName></Paper>. Some libraries, like HuCAL Gold\u2122, have refined their design strategies to extend diversity across multiple CDRs while consciously incorporating structures known to be preferred for specific binding contexts, such as peptide recognition <Paper corpusId=\"16807254\" paperTitle=\"(Finlay et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe degree of diversity also varies significantly between CDRs in modern synthetic libraries. For example, some libraries feature CDR-H1 and CDR-H2 with only six or eight binary degenerate codons (offering diversities of 64 and 256 unique sequences, respectively), while CDR-L3 and CDR-H3 contain 3-7 and 1-17 degenerate codons that can encode nine different amino acids, providing theoretical diversities on the order of 10^7 and 10^17 unique sequences, respectively <Paper corpusId=\"230675934\" paperTitle=\"(Kelil et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. This strategic allocation of diversity reflects the natural antibody tendency for highest variability in CDR-H3 and CDR-L3 <Paper corpusId=\"246433314\" paperTitle=\"(Davydova, 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nSelection pressure during phage display significantly influences amino acid composition. Analysis of pre- and post-selection sequences has revealed greater conservation in post-selection sequences, indicating that only a subset of the theoretical diversity yields functional antibodies <Paper corpusId=\"24737640\" paperTitle=\"(Qaraghuli et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>. This selection process often results in complementary electrostatic surfaces between the binding pocket and target antigen. CDR-H2 has been observed to play an important role in this context, both through direct interaction with antigens and by indirectly influencing the orientation and shape of the binding pocket when combined with CDR-H3 and CDR-L3 <Paper corpusId=\"24737640\" paperTitle=\"(Qaraghuli et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nFunctional studies have determined that both loop length and stem composition, particularly in CDR-H3, play critical roles in antibody performance <Paper corpusId=\"270629223\" paperTitle=\"(Hutchings et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. The CDR-L3 loop length has also been found to influence VH-antigen interactions, highlighting the interconnected nature of CDR contributions to binding specificity and affinity <Paper corpusId=\"270629223\" paperTitle=\"(Hutchings et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.

While na\u20ac \u0131ve libraries provide natural diversity by combination of functional V-gene segments isolated from the lymphoid tissues of non-immunized donors [e.g. CAT 1.0 and CAT 2.0 libraries of Cambridge Antibody Technology (Lloyd et al., 2008)109)], synthetic libraries such as the HuCALs (Morphosys) offer any desired amino acid compositions in the CDRs (Knappik et al., 2000)(Prassler et al., 2011). In general, it was observed that, despite the hypervariability of CDR sequences, there is a bias of functional CDRs to certain amino acid types, most of all tyrosine, glycine, and serine (Zemlin et al., 2003). Fellouse et al. showed that while scFv variants binding to some antigens at nanomolar affinities were selected from phage display libraries providing only a binary amino acid repertoire (i.e. tyrosine and serine), selections of binders from the same libraries to other antigens yielded affinities only in the micromolar range (113)(114)(115). Modifications of these libraries included an increased chemical diversity in CDR-H3 and the consideration of non-paratope residues potentially important for CDR conformation (116)."

Surprisingly, the minimalist libraries, containing sequences of only two residues, Tyr and Ser, in their CDRs, were proven highly effective in generating specific antibodies against a wide array of antigens providing a rationale for high abundance of these two residues in the CDRs of the natural immune repertoire [62]79]. Due to the simpler design, these libraries are relatively easy to construct, and, due to the smaller theoretical size, they possess higher sampling power. Involvement of more of CDRs and CDR positions into deeper diversification, while producing an exponentially increasing number of possible variants, allows to build more enhanced and sterically extended paratopes with higher conformational diversity, thus, facilitating efficient recognition of various epitopes of different types of antigens."

The composition of the CDR loops may have a significant influence on the antibody aggregation propensity. This is important to take into consideration when creating diversity for synthetic libraries as the natural selection in the immune cells is absent and the risk of aggregation of antibody clones might thus be increased. Propensities for aggregation were taken into account in the design of the CDR2 diversity, based on previously published work of the amino acid composition in CDR2 [6]. Generally the use of the most hydrophobic amino acids (i.e. V, I, L, M, and F) was kept at a moderate to low level (with a 0-25% likelihood of a hydrophobic amino acid at any given randomized position). This was done to lower the overall hydrophobicity of the CDRs thereby reducing the risk of aggregation [6], while at the same time allowing hydrophobic contributions to the antigen binding. Additional favorable contributions to binding, documented for tyrosine, serine and glycine, were taken into account in the design of both the CDR2 and CDR3 [40]. Positively charged amino acids were omitted or kept at very low frequencies for CDR2 and CDR3 respectively, as a high frequency of these have been linked to promotion of poly-reactivity (lack of specificity) and increased nucleic acid binding of the antibodies [16]40]. The CDR2 was designed to have a low diversity by limited randomization of only four positions (Figure 3). This entails that the overall diversity is minimized, thus ensuring that the total library diversity can be sampled in the phage display system. Due to the genetic rearrangements underlying the natural immune repertoire it is the CDR3 loop in the antibody repertoire which displays the highest diversity. Therefore the CDR3 loop in Predator library was designed to take this into account by randomizing seven positions."

This repertoire design was highly effective in generating nM-affinity clones with specificity for a selection of proteins and peptides (Knappik et al., 2000)(Marget et al., 2000). \n\nThe methods used by (Knappik et al., 2000) have since been elaborated upon in a number of reports. (Rothe et al., 2008), reported the construction of the next-generation library HuCal Gold\u2122 in which the design strategy was refined to change the CDR design complexity, the structural format of the library (to Fab fragment) and also to move to \"CysDisplay\" in which the expressed antibody is tethered to the phage via a disulphide bond with a mutant p3 protein. In this library, the CDR diversity was extended to the CDRs 1 and 2 of both V-domains, in addition to the CDR3s. The CDR cassettes were again based on trinucleotide technology and were built to accurately reflect the canonical structures and diversity found in the families upon which each of the consensus frameworks were built, consciously including structures known to be preferred in the recognition of peptides."

                            "By analyzing the human antibody repertoire in terms of structure, amino acid sequence diversity and germline usage, we found that seven V(H) and seven V(L) (four Vkappa and three Vlambda) germline families cover more than 95 % of the human antibody diversity used. A consensus sequence was derived for each family and optimized for expression in Escherichia coli. In order to make all six complementarity determining regions (CDRs) accessible for diversification, the synthetic genes were designed to be modular and mutually compatible by introducing unique restriction endonuclease sites flanking the CDRs. Molecular modeling verified that all canonical classes were present. We could show that all master genes are expressed as soluble proteins in the periplasm of E. coli. A first set of antibody phage display libraries totalling 2x10(9) members was created after cloning the genes in all 49 combinations into a phagemid vector, itself devoid of the restriction sites in question. Diversity was created by replacing the V(H) and V(L) CDR3 regions of the master genes by CDR3 library cassettes, generated from mixed trinucleotides and biased towards natural human antibody CDR3 sequences. The sequencing of 257 members of the unselected libraries indicated that the frequency of correct and thus potentially functional sequences was 61 %. Selection experiments against many antigens yielded a diverse set of binders with high affinities. Due to the modular design of all master genes, either single binders or even pools of binders can now be rapidly optimized without knowledge of the particular sequence, using pre-built CDR cassette libraries. The small number of 49 master genes will allow future improvements to be incorporated quickly, and the separation of the frameworks may help in analyzing why nature has evolved these distinct subfamilies of antibody germline genes."

Fifth, each of the four CDRs is composed of defined amino acid positions with restricted diversities. Therefore, the NGS data quality can be very accurately evaluated by assessing any deviations from the fixed framework or occurrence of unexpected codons at diversified positions. For instance, CDRs H1 and H2 contain only six or eight binary degenerate codons and offer a diversity of 64 and 256 unique sequences, respectively (Figure S1D). Conversely, CDRs L3 and H3 are much more diverse in terms of loop lengths (3-7 or 1-17 degenerate codons, respectively), and in terms of sequence composition (encoded by defined ratios of nine codons encoding nine amino acids). The CDRs L3 and H3 offer a theoretical diversity of the order of 10^7 and 10^17 unique sequences, respectively (Figure S1D). Ultimately, the four CDRs combined offer a practical diversity approximating 10^11 unique clones."

As part of this process, the important influence of CDR H2 on antigen binding was observed through its direct interaction with individual antigens and indirect impact on the orientation and the pocket shape, when combined with CDRs H3 and L3.

                "text": "\nThe diversification strategies employed for CDRs directly impact several critical therapeutic properties of antibodies:\n\n1. **Binding Affinity Enhancement**: Strategic CDR diversification can dramatically improve binding affinity, a key determinant of therapeutic efficacy. Targeted CDR diversification followed by stringent selection can yield antibodies with affinity improvements from nanomolar to picomolar ranges <Paper corpusId=\"3155125\" paperTitle=\"(Hu et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>. Libraries focusing on specific CDRs often show different potential for affinity enhancement, with studies demonstrating that CDR-L3 libraries sometimes produce more affinity-improved variants than corresponding CDR-H3 libraries, particularly when the parental CDR-H3 is already near-optimal <Paper corpusId=\"11913189\" paperTitle=\"(Ko et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n2. **Specificity and Cross-Reactivity Control**: The amino acid sequence within CDRs directly determines antibody binding specificity and cross-reactivity profiles <Paper corpusId=\"252734725\" paperTitle=\"(Li et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. Libraries incorporating varied CDR-H3 lengths have demonstrated the ability to generate antibodies with different binding profiles (mono-, bi-, or tri-specific) toward related receptors, illustrating how CDR design influences target selectivity <Paper corpusId=\"251258669\" paperTitle=\"(Maruthachalam et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n3. **Biophysical Properties Optimization**: CDR sequence composition significantly influences antibody biophysical properties that impact therapeutic development. Even within libraries using a fixed framework scaffold, CDR sequences can cause substantial variation in amplification efficiency during biopanning, affecting which antibodies are ultimately selected <Paper corpusId=\"249328057\" paperTitle=\"(Bai et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n4. **Developability Enhancement**: Restricted diversity in certain CDRs (CDR-H1 and CDR-H2) combined with highly variable CDR-H3 sequences has been shown to improve overall library performance, generating antibodies with favorable developability characteristics alongside nanomolar affinities <Paper corpusId=\"10576257\" paperTitle=\"(Ponsel et al., 2011)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n5. **Selection Pressure Response**: CDR design influences how antibodies respond to different selection pressures during phage display. Milder selection pressure can favor more diverse clones, while higher selection stringency typically results in convergence to fewer clones with improved affinity. This pattern is particularly evident in CDR-L3 libraries, where specific amino acid preferences emerge under stringent selection <Paper corpusId=\"11913189\" paperTitle=\"(Ko et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n6. **Engineered Framework Compatibility**: CDR grafting approaches have been developed to transplant CDRs from conventional antibodies onto alternative frameworks like nanobodies. While initial grafts may produce weak binders, these can serve as templates for targeted synthetic libraries that improve affinity without requiring animal immunization <Paper corpusId=\"259188216\" paperTitle=\"(Mustafa et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"53233964\" paperTitle=\"(Wagner et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n7. **Affinity Maturation Efficiency**: Rational stepwise strategies for CDR optimization can dramatically improve efficiency compared to traditional approaches. Methods combining microchip-synthesized degenerate oligonucleotides for CDR diversification with next-generation sequencing to identify beneficial variants can achieve substantial affinity improvements with smaller, more focused libraries <Paper corpusId=\"3155125\" paperTitle=\"(Hu et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n8. **Modulation of Therapeutic Properties**: Beyond binding characteristics, CDR diversification enables modulation of various antibody properties relevant to therapeutic applications. This includes improved functionality through random or directed mutagenesis of CDRs, DNA shuffling, or chain shuffling, with subsequent selection of variants offering enhanced therapeutic performance <Paper corpusId=\"49321986\" paperTitle=\"(Persson et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>.",

                            "Here, we described a rational stepwise strategy for the effective optimization of HuA21 to obtain low picomolar affinities by phage display. In brief, the approach started with the construction of multiple SPM libraries to diversify antibody CDRs using massively microchip-synthesized degenerate oligonucleotides. Subsequently, Illumina sequencing was used to compare the unselected and selected scFv libraries to identify beneficial variants. Last, candidate mutations from several CDRs were recombined to generate a small size phage library that was further selected to isolate mutants with greatly improved affinity.\n\nMany mutagenesis strategies have been applied in antibody affinity maturation, ranging from random mutagenesis across the complete gene sequence to targeted mutagenesis where the whole or hotspot positions in the CDR loops are diversified [2]. Typically, small CDR regions with less than 6-8 aa can be targeted for saturation mutagenesis. However, for longer CDRs, this process becomes impractical due to the limitation in the phage library sizes (10^9 \u221210^12) that may be generated and surveyed with confidence. Furthermore, numerous studies have revealed that in most cases, amino acid substitutions in a few specific positions (typically no more than three or four) in the targeted CDR are sufficient to significantly improvement affinity."

It is probable that the CDR-H3 of hz1E11 is already close to optimal and most mutations, especially in the region 97 H -100 H , are deleterious to the binding affinity, while the CDR-L3 sequence is not as optimal and the mutation in this region can result in significant improvement in the affinity. The L-NNK library panning outputs were enriched with clones with a hydrophobic amino acid at the position 91 L , a small amino acid at 92 L , and an aromatic amino acid at 93 L . This pattern is somewhat different from the parental CDR-L3 sequence of Q 89L QLYSTPWT 97L and again suggests that the CDR-L3 sequence of the parental 1E11 antibody was sub-optimal and thus had room for affinity improvement",

                            "A design strategy of mimicking natural diversity using tailored codons was used to closely mimic the human repertoire. Different library generations were described and it could be shown that the restricted diversity in CDR-H1 and CDR-H2 improved the performance of the library whereas highly variable CDR-H3 sequences were advantageous. Affinities in the low nanomolar range were achieved using these libraries.\n\nHoet and coworkers at Dyax combined synthetic diversity in CDR-H1 and -H2 with length and sequence diversity in CDR-H3 from natural origin (Figure 3) [63]. CDR-H1 and -H2 repertoires were designed based on analysis of germlines genes with introduction of hot spot mutations. Those variable parts were constructed with codon-based oligonuceotides to avoid unwanted amino acids and stop codons, with the aim to increase the functional library size. VH3_23 was used as heavy chain acceptor and combined with the full lambda and kappa light chain repertoire. The natural diversity of the CDR-H3 and light chains originated from B-cells of 35 donors having various autoimmune diseases and 10 healthy donors in order to maximize the diversity. The light chain and all three heavy chain CDRs are independently replaceable modules to facilitate affinity maturation. From the phagemid Fab library with a size of 3.5 \u00d7 10 10 and a phage library with a size of 1.0 \u00d7 10 10 , affinities in the subnanomolar range were obtained."

                            "Nanobodies, the smallest possible antibody format, have become of considerable interest for biotechnological and immunotherapeutic applications. They show excellent robustness, are non-immunogenic in humans, and can easily be engineered and produced in prokaryotic hosts. Traditionally, nanobodies are selected from camelid immune libraries involving the maintenance and treatment of animals. Recent advances have involved the generation of nanobodies from na\u00efve or synthetic libraries. However, such approaches demand large library sizes and sophisticated selection procedures. Here, we propose an alternative, two-step approach for the design and generation of nanobodies. In a first step, complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) are grafted from conventional antibody formats onto nanobody frameworks, generating weak antigen binders. In a second step, the weak binders serve as templates to design focused synthetic phage libraries for affinity maturation. We validated this approach by grafting toxin- and hapten-specific CDRs onto frameworks derived from variable domains of camelid heavy-chain-only antibodies (VHH). We then affinity matured the hapten binder via panning of a synthetic phage library. We suggest that this strategy can complement existing immune, na\u00efve, and synthetic library based methods, requiring neither animal experiments, nor large libraries, nor sophisticated selection protocols."

These methods enable significant improvements in binding affinity through strategic modification of CDR sequences, often achieving affinity enhancements from nanomolar to picomolar ranges with smaller, more focused libraries.

                "text": "\n1. **Sequential CDR Targeting**: A stepwise approach targeting CDR-L3 and CDR-H3 in sequence can yield substantial improvements in antibody affinity. This strategy has proven particularly effective when the parental CDR-H3 is already near-optimal, where CDR-L3 optimization can provide significant additional affinity gains without disrupting existing favorable interactions. <Paper corpusId=\"11913189\" paperTitle=\"(Ko et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\n2. **Tailored Selection Pressure Modulation**: Adjusting selection stringency during phage display can direct CDR optimization toward different outcomes. Milder selection conditions tend to yield more diverse antibody variants, while higher stringency typically drives convergence toward fewer clones with improved affinity. This approach is particularly effective for optimizing CDR-L3, where specific amino acid preferences emerge under stringent selection, such as hydrophobic residues at position 91L, small amino acids at 92L, and aromatic amino acids at 93L. <Paper corpusId=\"11913189\" paperTitle=\"(Ko et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\n3. **Rational Stepwise Optimization Strategy**: Advanced CDR optimization employs massively microchip-synthesized degenerate oligonucleotides to create focused single-point mutation (SPM) libraries targeting specific CDRs. This approach is followed by next-generation sequencing to identify beneficial variants by comparing unselected and selected libraries, enabling efficient identification of advantageous mutations even in longer CDRs where traditional saturation mutagenesis would be impractical. <Paper corpusId=\"3155125\" paperTitle=\"(Hu et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\n4. **Recombination of Beneficial Mutations**: After identifying favorable mutations in individual CDRs, these beneficial changes can be recombined into a smaller, more focused library that is subjected to further selection. This combinatorial approach has been shown to produce antibodies with dramatically improved affinities, often reaching low picomolar ranges, while maintaining manageable library sizes. <Paper corpusId=\"3155125\" paperTitle=\"(Hu et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\n5. **Multi-CDR Simultaneous Randomization**: Some optimization approaches target multiple residues simultaneously within a single CDR, such as positions 98, 100, 100b, 100c, 101, and 102 in CDR-H3. This approach can rapidly generate significant diversity at critical positions that directly influence binding. <Paper corpusId=\"9629900\" paperTitle=\"(Moon et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\n6. **Cross-CDR Combinatorial Strategy**: A particularly powerful technique involves first optimizing CDR-H3 and CDR-L3 separately, then combining the most promising variants to create antibodies with substitutions in both heavy and light chains. This combinatorial approach can yield affinity improvements exceeding 1000-fold compared to wild-type antibodies, with final dissociation constants (Kd) in the picomolar range. <Paper corpusId=\"9629900\" paperTitle=\"(Moon et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"23024981\" paperTitle=\"(Schier et al., 1996)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\n7. **Directed and Random Mutagenesis Approaches**: Antibody property modulation is frequently achieved through combinations of random mutagenesis and directed mutagenesis targeting specific CDR residues. These approaches capitalize on the assumption that CDRs carry most of the specificity-determining diversity of human antibodies and can be systematically modified to enhance therapeutic performance. <Paper corpusId=\"49321986\" paperTitle=\"(Persson et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\n8. **DNA Shuffling and Chain Shuffling**: These techniques introduce diversity by recombining genetic elements from different antibodies, creating novel combinations of CDR sequences.

It is probable that the CDR-H3 of hz1E11 is already close to optimal and most mutations, especially in the region 97 H -100 H , are deleterious to the binding affinity, while the CDR-L3 sequence is not as optimal and the mutation in this region can result in significant improvement in the affinity. The L-NNK library panning outputs were enriched with clones with a hydrophobic amino acid at the position 91 L , a small amino acid at 92 L , and an aromatic amino acid at 93 L . This pattern is somewhat different from the parental CDR-L3 sequence of Q 89L QLYSTPWT 97L and again suggests that the CDR-L3 sequence of the parental 1E11 antibody was sub-optimal and thus had room for affinity improvement",

                            "Here, we described a rational stepwise strategy for the effective optimization of HuA21 to obtain low picomolar affinities by phage display. In brief, the approach started with the construction of multiple SPM libraries to diversify antibody CDRs using massively microchip-synthesized degenerate oligonucleotides. Subsequently, Illumina sequencing was used to compare the unselected and selected scFv libraries to identify beneficial variants. Last, candidate mutations from several CDRs were recombined to generate a small size phage library that was further selected to isolate mutants with greatly improved affinity.\n\nMany mutagenesis strategies have been applied in antibody affinity maturation, ranging from random mutagenesis across the complete gene sequence to targeted mutagenesis where the whole or hotspot positions in the CDR loops are diversified [2]. Typically, small CDR regions with less than 6-8 aa can be targeted for saturation mutagenesis. However, for longer CDRs, this process becomes impractical due to the limitation in the phage library sizes (10^9 \u221210^12) that may be generated and surveyed with confidence. Furthermore, numerous studies have revealed that in most cases, amino acid substitutions in a few specific positions (typically no more than three or four) in the targeted CDR are sufficient to significantly improvement affinity."

Then, the selected variants were cloned into the expression vectors pOptiVEC (for heavy chain expression) or pcDNA3.3 (for light chain expression). An additional diverse antibody repertoire was achieved by a combination of heavy and light chains, and the resulting IgG antibodies with substituted residues in both the heavy and light chains were expressed in CHO-S cells and finally evaluated on their anti-cancer activity (step-by-step screening scheme, Fig. 2)."

                            "We determined the extent to which additional binding energy could be achieved by diversifying the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) located in the center of the antibody combining site of C6.5, a human single-chain Fv (scFv) isolated from a non-immune phage library which binds the tumor antigen c-erbB-2. CDR3 of the light (V(L)) and heavy (V(H)) chain variable region of C6.5 were sequentially mutated, the mutant scFv displayed on phage, and higher affinity mutants selected on antigen. Mutation of V(L) CDR3 yielded a scFv (C6ML3-9) with a 16-fold lower Kd (1.0 x 10(-9) M) than C6.5. Due to its length of 20 amino acids, four V(H) CDR3 libraries of C6ML3-9 were constructed. The greatest increase in affinity from a single library was ninefold (Kd = 1.1 x 10(-10) M). Combination of mutations isolated from separate V(H) CDR3 libraries yielded additional ninefold decreases in Kd, resulting in a scFv with a 1230-fold increase in affinity from wild-type C6.5 (Kd = 1.3 x 10(-11) M). The increase in affinity, and its absolute value, are comparable to the largest values observed for antibody affinity maturation in vivo or in vitro and indicate that mutation of V(L) and V(H) CDR3 may be a particularly efficient means to increase antibody affinity. This result, combined with the location of amino acid conservation and substitution, suggests an overall strategy for in vitro antibody affinity maturation. In addition, the affinities and binding kinetics of the single-chain Fv provide reagents with potential tumor targeting abilities not previously available."
