Pharmaceutical therapy remains the most reliable method for treatment of these diseases [1][2] . However, the limited ability of macromolecular drugs to cross the blood-spinal cord and blood-brain barriers constitutes one of the main problem in this area of medicine. Macromolecular drugs are excluded from the central nervous system by the presence of endothelial cell tight junctions at the blood-spinal cord and blood-brain barriers. Numerous studies have reported interesting approaches to identify a better way to enable drug delivery to the central nervous system through crossing the blood-spinal cord and blood-brain barriers [3][4][5][6][7][8] . Nanocarriers have been used to increase the stability of administered therapeutic molecules, improve their efficacy, and decrease undesired side effects [9] . Liposomes are well-investigated drug carriers. The plasma membrane presents a formidable barrier to the introduction of macromolecules into cells. Liposomes can diffuse through the endothelial cell membrane and enter the central nervous system passively. Nevertheless, some studies have demonstrated that naive liposomes cannot cross the blood-spinal cord barrier in large amounts to achieve a positive partition coefficient with the concentration administered [10][11] . Transactivating-transduction protein (TAT) is an 11 amino acid portion of the HIV-1 TAT protein that activates transcription of the viral genome [12] . Because traversal through cellular membranes represents a major barrier for efficient delivery of macromolecules into cells, the TAT protein may serve to transport various drugs. It has been widely shown [13][14] that addition of TAT and polyethylene glycol (PEG) to the surface of liposomes enhances their ability to be delivered across cellular membranes and also cross the blood-brain barrier. Few studies have focused on the mechanism by which TAT-PEG-modified liposomes cross the blood-spinal cord and blood-brain barriers. Fluorescence microscopy is among the most important tools to follow the specific interactions of targeted liposomes with cells and elucidate fine details of their intracellular fate [15] .\n\nTherefore, this study was designed to analyze the delivery of a novel liposome",

Lee\n## Abstract\n\n Biomaterials are natural, synthetic, or hybrid materials, which are used in medical devices or implants that are placed in contact with the human biological system to compensate for or restore diminished functions of the body. The field of biomaterials has rapidly developed to meet the ever-expanding needs in healthcare and medicine practices. Advancements in science and technology have enabled the fabrication and reengineering of biomaterials into useful medical devices or implants, such as heart valves, bone plates, hip joints, and cardiac pacemakers. Because biomaterials are placed in continuous close contact with the recipient\u2019s body fluids or tissues, the classification of available biomaterials is crucial for selecting safer and highly biocompatible materials. This review focuses on biomaterial classification, namely bioceramic, polymeric, and metallic biomaterials. Their medical applications, advantages, and disadvantages are discussed. Current trends in biomaterials involved in disease treatments, such as controlled drug delivery and cancer therapy, are additionally explored.\n\n## Polymer-based biomaterials\nThe blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a major challenge preventing effective systemic drug administration in the treatment of brain diseases. Lammers et al. [76] have demonstrated that poly(butylcyanoacrylate)-based microbubbles encased in ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles can mediate and monitor BBB permeability in a mouse model. Another study in canines has reported that polymeric magnetite nanoparticles encapsulating chemotherapy drugs bypass[ing] the BBB and facilitate the delivery to intracranial tumors after infusion by convection-enhanced delivery [77]. The spatial control and bypassing of the BBB are critical for drug delivery in treating brain disorders such as brain tumors, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease.",

These disorders are difficult to manage due to the complexity of disease mechanisms and the protective blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB), which restricts drug delivery. Recent advancements in nanoparticle (NP) technologies offer promising solutions, with potential applications in drug delivery, neuroprotection, and neuroregeneration. By examining current research, we explore how NPs can cross the BBB, deliver medications directly to targeted CNS regions, and enhance both diagnostics and treatment. Key NP strategies, such as passive targeting, receptor-mediated transport, and stimuli-responsive systems, demonstrate encouraging results. Studies show that NPs may improve drug delivery, minimize side effects, and increase therapeutic effectiveness in models of Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s, stroke, and glioblastoma. NP technologies thus represent a promising approach for CNS disorder management, combining drug delivery and diagnostic capabilities to enable more precise and effective treatments that could significantly benefit patient outcomes.",

Toader, A. Dumitru, Lucian Eva, Matei Serban, Razvan-Adrian Covache-Busuioc, A. Ciurea\n## Abstract\nThis review aims to address the significant challenges of treating central nervous system (CNS) disorders such as neurodegenerative diseases, strokes, spinal cord injuries, and brain tumors. These disorders are difficult to manage due to the complexity of disease mechanisms and the protective blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB), which restricts drug delivery. Recent advancements in nanoparticle (NP) technologies offer promising solutions, with potential applications in drug delivery, neuroprotection, and neuroregeneration. By examining current research, we explore how NPs can cross the BBB, deliver medications directly to targeted CNS regions, and enhance both diagnostics and treatment. Key NP strategies, such as passive targeting, receptor-mediated transport, and stimuli-responsive systems, demonstrate encouraging results. Studies show that NPs may improve drug delivery, minimize side effects, and increase therapeutic effectiveness in models of Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s, stroke, and glioblastoma. NP technologies thus represent a promising approach for CNS disorder management, combining drug delivery and diagnostic capabilities to enable more precise and effective treatments that could significantly benefit patient outcomes.\n## Passive Targeting\nPassive targeting exploits the physicochemical properties of NPs to achieve BBB penetration without requiring specific interactions with receptors or transporters. NPs under 100 nm with optimized surface properties, such as lipophilic coatings or PEGylation, can diffuse across the BBB via adsorptive-mediated transcytosis or nonspecific interactions [19].

            "abstract": "BackgroundDesigning efficient 'vectors', to deliver therapeutics across endothelial barriers, in a controlled manner, remains one of the key goals of drug development. Recently, transcytosis of liposome encapsulated fluorescence marker calcein across a tight cell barrier was studied. The most efficient liposomes were found to be liposomes containing sufficient amount of alkyl phospholipid (APL) perifosine. APLs have similar structure as lysophosphatidyl choline (LPC), since APLs were synthesized as metabolically stable analogues of LPC, which increases endothelial permeability directly by inducing endothelial cell contraction, resulting in formation of gaps between endothelial cells. Since one of the unique properties of lysolipid, containing liposomal formulations is dynamic equilibrium of lysolipids, which are distributed among liposomes, micelles, and free form, such liposomes represent a reservoir of free lysolipids. On the other hand lysolipid containing liposomes also represent a reservoir of an encapsulated hydrophilic drug.Presentation of the hypothesisWe hypothesize that free lysolipids, with highest concentration in vicinity of drug carrying liposomes, compromise endothelial integrity, primarily where concentrations of liposomes is the highest, in a similar manner as LPC, by formation of gaps between endothelial cells. Liposome encapsulated drug, which leaks from liposomes, due to liposome destabilization, caused by lysolipid depletion, can therefore be efficiently transported across the locally compromised endothelial barrier.Testing the hypothesisThis hypothesis could be verified: by measuring binding of perifosine and other lysolipids to albumin and to lysophospholipid receptor (LPL-R) group; formation of stress fibers and subsequent cell contraction; activation of RhoA, and endothelial barrier dysfunction; by a synthesis of other LPC analogues with high critical micellar concentration and measuring their effect on transendothelial permeability in presence and absence of albumin.Implications of the hypothesisWe propose that lysolipid containing liposomal formulations might be used as nonspecific transendothelial transport vector, since leakage of liposome encapsulated active drug occurs simultaneously with the release of the lysolipids. The concentration of the active drug is therefore expected to be the highest at the site of compromised endothelial barrier. By appropriate choice of the lysolipids an endothelial barrier would stay open only for a short time. Use of such liposomes would potentially maximize the delivery of the drug while limiting the passage of toxic substances and pathogens across the endothelial barrier. Combining lysolipid containing liposomes with superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles or a targeting ligand might be required to efficiently localize drug delivery to a disease affected tissue and to avoid endothelial disruption over the entire body.",

Designing efficient 'vectors' (antibodies, protein carriers, viruses, nanoparticles) to deliver therapeutics, especially to the disease-affected brain tissue, in a controlled and non-invasive manner remains one of the key goals of drug development [1]. Careful regulation of material exchange into and out of the brain is essential for the survival of neurons, which do not have a significant capacity to regenerate. This transport is regulated by the blood-brain barrier (BBB), a dynamic interface between the blood and the brain formed by endothelial cells of the brain capillaries. However, it also very efficiently prevents the brain uptake of most therapeutically active compounds. Because of this, many diseases of central nervous system (CNS), such as Alzheimer's disease, are undertreated. As a result, various strategies have been developed to improve the access of drugs to the brain parenchyma at therapeutically necessary concentrations to effectively manage diseases [2,3]. Various drug delivery systems such as: liposomes, surfactant coated polymeric nanoparticles, solid lipid nanoparticles [4], microspheres, nanogels, and bionanocapsules were tested for delivery of drugs to tumors of the CNS with different efficiancies [5][6][7][8]. Even though transcytosis is often thought to be a selective process, endothelial cells of microvasculature move macromolecular cargo rather nonselectively within the fluid phase of the transport vesicle or by absorption to the vesicle membrane [9]. Using vectors promoting transcytosis in such nonspecific manner can be more widely applied, especially in combination with nanoparticles or liposomes, into which large amounts of a drug can be incorporated [10]. Liposomes seem to be a promising delivery system, which enable high cellular uptake and efficient transcytosis across cellular barriers including the BBB, as their composition can be easily adjusted according to the properties of targeted cells and tissues [11]. It is expected that by a proper choice of liposome composition an efficient transcytosis of liposome entrapped drugs across",

Although the appearance of liposomes in the circulation was much slower after intraperitoneal administration, comparable maximum levels of long circulating liposomes were found between 4 and 24\u2009h after injection. Furthermore, 24\u2009h after injection a similar tissue distribution was found. To investigate the effect of GSH coating on brain delivery in vitro uptake studies in rat brain endothelial cells (RBE4) and an in vivo brain microdialysis study in rats were used. Significantly more fluorescent tracer was found in RBE4 cell homogenates incubated with GSH-PEG liposomes compared to non-targeted PEG liposomes (1.8-fold, p\u2009<\u20090.001). In the microdialysis study 4-fold higher (p\u2009<\u20090.001) brain levels of fluorescent tracer were found after intravenous injection of GSH-PEG liposomes compared with PEG control liposomes.

Most hydrophilic molecules are not able to cross the BBB due to the presence of tight junctions between the brain endothelial cells preventing paracellular transport. Transport of other more lipophilic small molecules that could potentially cross the barrier is often limited because they are substrate for efflux transporters like the p-glycoprotein (Pgp), multidrug related protein (MRP) or breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) transporters [1][2][3]. Many strategies to enhance the BBB transport of drugs have therefore been investigated.

Some examples of commonly used nanocarriers are liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles, albumin nanoparticles and polymeric nanoparticles [8]. Drug delivery using nanocarriers may increase the bioavailability and stability of drugs and decrease the (peripheral) toxicity. Furthermore, drugs delivered by liposomes are described to be able to bypass the efflux transporters at the BBB [9,10]. Moreover, liposomal formulation allows a wide range of compounds, like small molecules, peptides, proteins and RNA to be encapsulated without changing their function and protecting them against degradation and potential immune responses. Coating of liposomes with polyethylene glycol (PEG) further ensures a prolonged circulation time in plasma allowing prolonged dosing intervals. As a result, liposomes have been used in clinical practice for several years and are shown to be effective and safe for human use (e.g. Doxil \u00d5 , Ambisome \u00d5 ).

Nano-drug system targeted drug delivery to achieve drug release, increase the insoluble drugs and peptide drug bio-e\ufb03ciency, reduce the toxicity and application of drugs and other aspects of the development of good prospects, and thus become one of the key research in recent years\u2019 field. Synthesis and application of nanometer drug carriers this review is presented in recent years and its application to provide a comprehensive basis for the treatment process. Describes the nature and preparation of nano-drug carrier methods, in recent years, people have been widely concerned by scholars. Compared with the nano-drug delivery, the general pharmaceutical cannot have to extend the role of drugs, strong e\ufb03cacy, and the advantages of small drug response. Nano-materials, the specific surface area, surface activity, high catalytic efficiency, surface active center, adsorption capacity and other characteristics, which has many excellent features and new features.\n## Application of nanometer drug carrier in clinical medicine\nLiposomes or microcapsules as a drug carrier can improve the water solubility of drugs, so that drug targeting, reduce drug toxicity and prolong the residence time, prolonged the survival time of tumor animals.

            "abstract": "Simple Summary Glioma is the most prevalent form of primary malignant brain tumor and is often associated with a grim prognosis. Exosomes, minute extracellular vesicles, are secreted by various cells and hold a significant role in tumor growth and invasion. Examining the contents they carry allows for a deeper understanding of tumor characteristics and progression. Moreover, exosomes possess the capability to traverse the blood\u2013brain barrier, functioning as effective delivery vehicles. By encapsulating chemotherapy drugs and other molecules, we can achieve an enhanced therapeutic outcome. This article primarily delves into the impact of exosomes on glioma development, as well as the latest strides in diagnosis and treatment. This underscores the advantages and potential avenues for future research in the realm of exosomes for glioma diagnosis and treatment. Abstract Gliomas, the most prevalent primary malignant brain tumors, present a challenging prognosis even after undergoing surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Exosomes, nano-sized extracellular vesicles secreted by various cells, play a pivotal role in glioma progression and contribute to resistance against chemotherapy and radiotherapy by facilitating the transportation of biological molecules and promoting intercellular communication within the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, exosomes exhibit the remarkable ability to traverse the blood\u2013brain barrier, positioning them as potent carriers for therapeutic delivery. These attributes hold promise for enhancing glioma diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. Recent years have witnessed significant advancements in exosome research within the realm of tumors. In this article, we primarily focus on elucidating the role of exosomes in glioma development, highlighting the latest breakthroughs in therapeutic and diagnostic approaches, and outlining prospective directions for future research.",

                    "text": "Nanocarriers, due to their small size and adaptability, have shown significant promise in drug delivery. Exosomes, as natural nanoparticles, have garnered attention for CNS disease treatment, owing to their potential for natural BBB crossing and versatile surface engineering. Banks and colleagues investigated the capacity of 10 exosome populations obtained from mouse, human, cancerous, and non-cancerous cell lines to traverse the bloodbrain barrier [41]. The study revealed that all tested exosomes successfully crossed the blood-brain barrier, exhibiting diverse rates and engaging in various vesicular-mediated mechanisms, including specific transporters, adsorptive transcytosis, and a brain-to-blood efflux system. [42] Recent research indicates that exosomes derived from different parent cells exhibit varying tropisms for organs and tissues [43]. For example, neural-stem-cellderived EVs demonstrated enhanced CNS distribution compared to mesenchymal-stemcell-derived EVs in a mouse stroke model [44]. Furthermore, under specific pathological conditions, such as brain inflammation or tumors, there is a notable enhancement in exosome transport across the blood-brain barrier [45,46]. In mice with brain inflammation, exosomes derived from macrophages demonstrated more than a three-fold increase in delivery to the brain compared to those in normal mice [47]. Studies have postulated two possibilities for the uptake of exosomes by the brain: either being sequestered inside the brain endothelial cells or undergoing complete passage through the endothelial cell barrier [41,45]. Julien Saint-Pol et al. propose several hypothetical pathways to elucidate the communication and interaction between exosomes and the target brain cells [48]. Through the utilization of uptake mechanisms, strategies have been employed to enhance the potential of exosomes to traverse the blood-brain barrier as follows. \n\nThe process of receptor-mediated transcytosis (RMT) involves the movement of invaginated endosomal compartments to the opposite side of the membrane and is initiated by the binding of a specific ligand to its corresponding receptor. RMT has been extensively studied and widely applied for transportation through the endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier [49].",

Exosomes, minute extracellular vesicles, are secreted by various cells and hold a significant role in tumor growth and invasion. Examining the contents they carry allows for a deeper understanding of tumor characteristics and progression. Moreover, exosomes possess the capability to traverse the blood\u2013brain barrier, functioning as effective delivery vehicles. By encapsulating chemotherapy drugs and other molecules, we can achieve an enhanced therapeutic outcome. This article primarily delves into the impact of exosomes on glioma development, as well as the latest strides in diagnosis and treatment. This underscores the advantages and potential avenues for future research in the realm of exosomes for glioma diagnosis and treatment. Abstract Gliomas, the most prevalent primary malignant brain tumors, present a challenging prognosis even after undergoing surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Exosomes, nano-sized extracellular vesicles secreted by various cells, play a pivotal role in glioma progression and contribute to resistance against chemotherapy and radiotherapy by facilitating the transportation of biological molecules and promoting intercellular communication within the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, exosomes exhibit the remarkable ability to traverse the blood\u2013brain barrier, positioning them as potent carriers for therapeutic delivery. These attributes hold promise for enhancing glioma diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. Recent years have witnessed significant advancements in exosome research within the realm of tumors. In this article, we primarily focus on elucidating the role of exosomes in glioma development, highlighting the latest breakthroughs in therapeutic and diagnostic approaches, and outlining prospective directions for future research.\n## Potentiality for Crossing the BBB Based on Exosomes\nNanocarriers, due to their small size and adaptability, have shown significant promise in drug delivery. Exosomes, as natural nanoparticles, have garnered attention for CNS disease treatment, owing to their potential for natural BBB crossing and versatile surface engineering. Banks and colleagues investigated the capacity of 10 exosome populations obtained from mouse, human, cancerous, and non-cancerous cell lines to traverse the bloodbrain barrier [41]. The study revealed that all tested exosomes successfully crossed the blood-brain barrier, exhibiting diverse rates and engaging in various vesicular-mediated mechanisms, including specific transporters, adsorptive transcytosis, and a brain-to-blood efflux system. [42] Recent research indicates that exosomes derived from different parent cells exhibit varying tropisms for organs and tissues [43]. For example, neural-stem-cellderived EVs demonstrated enhanced CNS distribution compared to mesenchymal-stemcell-derived EVs in a mouse stroke model [44]. Furthermore, under specific pathological conditions, such as brain inflammation or tumors, there is a notable enhancement in exosome transport across the blood-brain barrier [45,46]. In mice with brain inflammation, exosomes derived from macrophages demonstrated more than a three-fold increase in delivery to the brain compared to those in normal mice [47]. Studies have postulated two possibilities for the uptake of exosomes by the brain: either being sequestered inside the brain endothelial cells or undergoing complete passage through the endothelial cell barrier [41,45]. Julien Saint-Pol et al. propose several hypothetical pathways to elucidate the communication and interaction between exosomes and the target brain cells [48]. Through the utilization of uptake mechanisms, strategies have been employed to enhance the potential of exosomes to traverse the blood-brain barrier as follows. \n\nThe process of receptor-mediated transcytosis (RMT) involves the movement of invaginated endosomal compartments to the opposite side of the membrane and is initiated by the binding of a specific ligand to its corresponding receptor. RMT has been extensively studied and widely applied for transportation through the endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier [49].",

Among brain cancer types, glioblastoma multiforme is a common tumour [77], with a mean survival rate of ~ 3.3% at three years post-diagnosis [77,78]. Brain cancers have traditionally been treated with a surgical procedure followed by systemic chemotherapy, but these are limited due to the effects on the brain and severe toxicity. Nanocarrier-based strategies to enhance anti-cancer drug delivery into the tumor site within the brain without destroying any healthy tissues or organs are thus being widely studied [79]. \n\nThe major challenge to chemotherapeutic delivery to the brain is the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The BBB is a protective barrier between the blood and brain tissue, preventing molecules from entering the central nervous system [80]. The BBB is formed through microvascular endothelial cells wrapped by tight junctions, adherens junctions, microvessels, pericytes, and astrocytes and interconnected by microglia and neurons [81,82]. The BBB is an obstacle to transporting many therapeutic molecules into and out of the brain [83]. More than 90% of small molecules and approximately 100% of large therapeutics are prohibited from crossing the BBB [80]. Additionally, those few therapeutic agents capable of permeating the BBB may be actively transported back into the blood vasculature via efflux transporters, such as P-gp [84]. Furthermore, metabolic degradation in the brain may reduce the accumulation of drugs in the brain [85]. \n\nAs a drug carrier, liposomes are considered an excellent candidate for crossing the BBB due to their structural resemblance with the lipid bilayer of the endothelial cell membrane [86]. The outer surface of liposomes can also be modified to extend their circulation time in the blood, thus enhancing the time available to penetrate the brain [87].",

            "abstract": "Abstract Lipid-structured vesicles have been applied for drug delivery system for over 50 years. Based on their origin, lipid-structured vesicles are divided into two main categories, namely synthetic lipid vesicles (SLNVEs) and vesicles of mammalian origin (MDVEs). Although SLNVEs can stably transport anti-cancer drugs, their biocompatibility is poor and degradation of exogenous substances is a potential risk. Unlike SLNVEs, MDVEs have excellent biocompatibility but are limited by a lack of stability and a risk of contamination by dangerous pathogens from donor cells. Since the first discovery of plant-derived vesicles (PDVEs) in carrot cell supernatants in 1967, emerging evidence has shown that PDVEs integrate the advantages of both SLNVEs and MDVEs. Notably, 55 years of dedicated research has indicated that PDVEs are an ideal candidate vesicle for drug preparation, transport, and disease treatment. The current review systematically focuses on the role of PDVEs in cancer therapy and in particular compares the properties of PDVEs with those of conventional lipid vesicles, summarizes the preparation methods and quality control of PDVEs, and discusses the application of PDVEs in delivering anti-cancer drugs and their underlying molecular mechanisms for cancer therapy. Finally, the challenges and future perspectives of PDVEs for the development of novel therapeutic strategies against cancer are discussed.",

Based on their origin, lipid-structured vesicles are divided into two main categories, namely synthetic lipid vesicles (SLNVEs) and vesicles of mammalian origin (MDVEs). Although SLNVEs can stably transport anti-cancer drugs, their biocompatibility is poor and degradation of exogenous substances is a potential risk. Unlike SLNVEs, MDVEs have excellent biocompatibility but are limited by a lack of stability and a risk of contamination by dangerous pathogens from donor cells. Since the first discovery of plant-derived vesicles (PDVEs) in carrot cell supernatants in 1967, emerging evidence has shown that PDVEs integrate the advantages of both SLNVEs and MDVEs. Notably, 55 years of dedicated research has indicated that PDVEs are an ideal candidate vesicle for drug preparation, transport, and disease treatment. The current review systematically focuses on the role of PDVEs in cancer therapy and in particular compares the properties of PDVEs with those of conventional lipid vesicles, summarizes the preparation methods and quality control of PDVEs, and discusses the application of PDVEs in delivering anti-cancer drugs and their underlying molecular mechanisms for cancer therapy. Finally, the challenges and future perspectives of PDVEs for the development of novel therapeutic strategies against cancer are discussed.\n## Crossing Barriers\nBiological barriers block foreign substances to maintain homeostasis but also prevent drugs from reaching a lesion. When administered orally, most drugs are unable to enter the bloodstream because of the intestinal barrier. When treating brainrelated diseases, drugs have difficulties entering the brain due to the blood-brain barrier and instead reach other organs, leading to potentially severe side effects. 100 Based on the phospholipid surface and nanostructure, PDVEs can transport a drug through a biological barrier and improve the bioavailability of the drug. \n\nOne prominent example showcasing the potential of PDVEs in surmounting biological barriers is their application in delivering dexamethasone (Dex) for neuroinflammation-related disease treatment. Dex is known for its anti-inflammatory properties, but its therapeutic potential is limited due to its poor bioavailability and inability to cross the blood-brain barrier efficiently. Researchers utilized Allium tuberosum-derived PDVEs to encapsulate Dex. Upon administration, these PDVEs were shown high efficiency in crossing the blood-brain barrier, and delivered Dex directly to the affected brain regions. This led to a significant alleviation of inflammation in microglial, demonstrating the potency of PDVEs as drug delivery vehicles for brain diseases. 101 o verify the ability of PDVEs to penetrate the intestinal barrier, grape-derived vesicles (GDVEs) were stained with fluorescent dyes. The results showed that GDVEs accumulated in the intestine during the first 6 h after oral administration and were decreased within 48 h. 35 Most brain cancers require surgical intervention since the restrictive bloodbrain barrier usually prevents drugs from reaching a therapeutic concentration. However, it was found that GfDVEs carrying miR17 could significantly inhibit brain cancer growth, without any toxic effects. 92 Notably, although PDVEs could cross biological barriers, they could not penetrate the placental barrier when injected intravenously into pregnant mice, suggesting the high safety of PDVEs in pregnant women. 102 Taken together, PDVEs act as intelligent Trojan horses, encasing a drug and crossing a biological barrier to transport it to the lesion.

We have previously demonstrated the biocompatibility and therapeutic potential of the layer-by-layer (LbL)-fabricated microcapsules aimed at the localized delivery of specific channel blockers to peripheral nerves. Here, we explore the potential of LbL-microcapsules to enable site-specific, directional action of neurotrophins to stimulate neuronal morphogenesis and synaptic circuit formation. We find that nanoengineered biodegradable microcapsules loaded with nerve growth factor (NGF) can guide the morphological development of hippocampal neurons in vitro. The presence of NGF-loaded microcapsules or their clusters increases the neurite outgrowth rate while boosting neurite branching. Microcapsule clusters appear to guide the trajectory of developing individual axons leading to the formation of functional synapses. Our observations highlight the potential of NGF-loaded, biodegradable LbL-microcapsules to help guide axonal development and possibly circuit regeneration in neuropathology.",

                    "text": "The polyelectrolyte microcapsules fabricated by the LbL-technique have been demonstrated as an efficient delivery system for targeting different tissue and cell types. The suitability for this type of carriers has been confirmed in animals in vivo through either systemic application [44][45][46][47] or during local injections of the microcapsule suspension into the targeted tissue [24]. However, there have been only a few attempts to explore the use of biodegradable LbL-microcapsules in the central nervous system, especially with respect to the brain where multiple and distinct cell types are densely inter-connected with high spatial specificity. Therefore, our aim was to examine the potential of LbL-microcapsules for localised delivery of neurotrophins to central neurons, a potential tool to enhance guidance and formation of functional neuronal connections. This context differs from that of systemic application which envisages blood-brain barrier permeability followed by cell targeting.\n\nOur strategy took advantage of the previous work in which fabrication protocols, release properties, and biodegradation in situ and in vivo for the LbL-fabricated microcapsules have been established [12,23,24,33]. Thus, the functional data obtained here in neuronal-astrocyte co-cultures, together with the previous reports pertaining to the encapsulation per se, suggest that LbL microcapsules meet the key requirements for applications targeting brain neurons. These include (i) high biocompatibility (no excitotoxicity) for all constitutive components of the microcapsule, (ii) gradual, prolonged release of the encapsulated compound of interest (including low molecular weight substances), and (iii) biodegradability (safe use). Monitoring primary hippocampal neurons in the present work has revealed no signs of excitotoxicity in the presence of microcapsules, at any stage of neuronal development and morphogenesis in vitro. Again, this is consistent with no effects of empty LbL-microcapsules (of the same composition) on primary hippocampal neurons or on peripheral nerve cells in vivo [24]. In addition, numerous studies have reported no toxicity produced by the Lb",

Kopach, A. Pavlov, O. Sindeeva, G. Sukhorukov, D. Rusakov\n## Abstract\nNeurological disorders and traumas often involve loss of specific neuronal connections, which would require intervention with high spatial precision. We have previously demonstrated the biocompatibility and therapeutic potential of the layer-by-layer (LbL)-fabricated microcapsules aimed at the localized delivery of specific channel blockers to peripheral nerves. Here, we explore the potential of LbL-microcapsules to enable site-specific, directional action of neurotrophins to stimulate neuronal morphogenesis and synaptic circuit formation. We find that nanoengineered biodegradable microcapsules loaded with nerve growth factor (NGF) can guide the morphological development of hippocampal neurons in vitro. The presence of NGF-loaded microcapsules or their clusters increases the neurite outgrowth rate while boosting neurite branching. Microcapsule clusters appear to guide the trajectory of developing individual axons leading to the formation of functional synapses. Our observations highlight the potential of NGF-loaded, biodegradable LbL-microcapsules to help guide axonal development and possibly circuit regeneration in neuropathology.\n## Discussion\nThe polyelectrolyte microcapsules fabricated by the LbL-technique have been demonstrated as an efficient delivery system for targeting different tissue and cell types. The suitability for this type of carriers has been confirmed in animals in vivo through either systemic application [44][45][46][47] or during local injections of the microcapsule suspension into the targeted tissue [24]. However, there have been only a few attempts to explore the use of biodegradable LbL-microcapsules in the central nervous system, especially with respect to the brain where multiple and distinct cell types are densely inter-connected with high spatial specificity. Therefore, our aim was to examine the potential of LbL-microcapsules for localised delivery of neurotrophins to central neurons, a potential tool to enhance guidance and formation of functional neuronal connections. This context differs from that of systemic application which envisages blood-brain barrier permeability followed by cell targeting.\n\nOur strategy took advantage of the previous work in which fabrication protocols, release properties, and biodegradation in situ and in vivo for the LbL-fabricated microcapsules have been established [12,23,24,33]. Thus, the functional data obtained here in neuronal-astrocyte co-cultures, together with the previous reports pertaining to the encapsulation per se, suggest that LbL microcapsules meet the key requirements for applications targeting brain neurons. These include (i) high biocompatibility (no excitotoxicity) for all constitutive components of the microcapsule, (ii) gradual, prolonged release of the encapsulated compound of interest (including low molecular weight substances), and (iii) biodegradability (safe use). Monitoring primary hippocampal neurons in the present work has revealed no signs of excitotoxicity in the presence of microcapsules, at any stage of neuronal development and morphogenesis in vitro. Again, this is consistent with no effects of empty LbL-microcapsules (of the same composition) on primary hippocampal neurons or on peripheral nerve cells in vivo [24]. In addition, numerous studies have reported no toxicity produced by the Lb",

The blood-brain barrier (BBB) remains Central nervous system (CNS) therapeutic delivery, a significant challenge without effective vivo therapeutic methods in clinical practice. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) with multi-directional differentiation potential have the characteristics of low immunogenicity, strong proliferation ability, immune regulation, and multi-directional differentiation potential. The repair effects have been identified mediated by transplanted MSCs paracrine factors, including exosomes and nanometer-sized cell communication mediators, to reduce tissue injury and enhance repair, growth, and regeneration. MSC-derived exosomes have become an attractive vehicle by passing through the blood-brain barrier (BBB), delivering therapeutic agents targeting the brain for treating autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases. Safeties, convenience, and the effectiveness of MSC-derived exosomes have been demonstrated mainly through mechanistic clinical and preclinical evidence of potential nanotherapeutic agents for further prevalent use. Thus, we want to investigate the clinical applications of MSC-derived exosomes to reveal their regenerative treatment capacity from direct and indirect neuron repairment effect, reduced neuroinflammation, and nanotherapeutic agent advantage. This paper discusses the potential and practicality of using this novel cell-free entity of mesenchymal stem cell derivatives such as exosomes in vivo administration as a therapeutic modality for treating degenerative disease and pathologies and innovation and emerging trends in the field.",

The blood-brain barrier (BBB) remains Central nervous system (CNS) therapeutic delivery, a significant challenge without effective vivo therapeutic methods in clinical practice. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) with multi-directional differentiation potential have the characteristics of low immunogenicity, strong proliferation ability, immune regulation, and multi-directional differentiation potential. The repair effects have been identified mediated by transplanted MSCs paracrine factors, including exosomes and nanometer-sized cell communication mediators, to reduce tissue injury and enhance repair, growth, and regeneration. MSC-derived exosomes have become an attractive vehicle by passing through the blood-brain barrier (BBB), delivering therapeutic agents targeting the brain for treating autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases. Safeties, convenience, and the effectiveness of MSC-derived exosomes have been demonstrated mainly through mechanistic clinical and preclinical evidence of potential nanotherapeutic agents for further prevalent use. Thus, we want to investigate the clinical applications of MSC-derived exosomes to reveal their regenerative treatment capacity from direct and indirect neuron repairment effect, reduced neuroinflammation, and nanotherapeutic agent advantage. This paper discusses the potential and practicality of using this novel cell-free entity of mesenchymal stem cell derivatives such as exosomes in vivo administration as a therapeutic modality for treating degenerative disease and pathologies and innovation and emerging trends in the field.\n## Exosomes in Neurodegenerative disease\nAlvarez-Erviti et al. found that DC-derived exosomes can deliver siRNA to the brain of mice and inferred that drugs or siRNA loaded with exosomes can pass through the BBB. They first transduced DC to express the exosome membrane protein LAMP2B, which can be fused with neuron-specific RVG peptides [41]. The purified DC exosomes contained exogenous siRNA targeting BACE1, a crucial regulatory gene in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease; these exosomes were injected intravenously into mice [42]. These exosomes specifically enter the neurons, microglia, and oligodendrocytes in the brain, leading to the knockdown of the BACE1 gene in the mouse model. This study proves the feasibility of specific systemic delivery of exosomes. More importantly, the study shows that exosomes can pass through biological barriers, indicating the possibility of RNAibased treatment of new brain tumors and brain metastases [41][42][43]. \n\nInjecting MSC-derived exosomes secreted into TBI rats intravenously observed that the exosomes secreted by MSCs could reduce the activation of astrocytes and microglia in the brain of TBI rats. Which represents the ability to inhibit inflammation and promote the recovery of nerve function [43]. A significant obstacle in treating neuroinflammatory diseases is no effective carrier to transport drugs across the blood-brain barrier. Exosomes can become ideal drug delivery vehicles of neuroinflammatory illnesses due to low immunity, innate stability, high delivery efficiency, and crossing the blood-brain barrier. The research results show that encapsulating curcumin into exosomes can increase curcumin's solubility, stability, and bioavailability compared with curcumin encapsulated in liposomes alone [44]. \n\nZhang's research showed exosome-encapsulated curcumin intranasally to interfere with lipopolysaccharide-induced rat brain inflammation model and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoproteininduced rat experimental autoimmune brain inflammation.",

However, their inability to cross the blood\u2013brain barrier hampers the clinical translation of these therapeutic strategies. Liposomes are nanoparticles composed of lipid bilayers, which can effectively encapsulate drugs and improve drug delivery across the blood\u2013brain barrier and into brain tissue through their targeting and permeability. Therefore, they can potentially treat traumatic and nontraumatic central nervous system diseases. In this review, we outlined the common properties and preparation methods of liposomes, including thin-film hydration, reverse-phase evaporation, solvent injection techniques, detergent removal methods, and microfluidics techniques. Afterwards, we comprehensively discussed the current applications of liposomes in central nervous system diseases, such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease, Huntington\u2019s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, and brain tumors. Most studies related to liposomes are still in the laboratory stage and have not yet entered clinical trials. Additionally, their application as drug delivery systems in clinical practice faces challenges such as drug stability, targeting efficiency, and safety. Therefore, we proposed development strategies related to liposomes to further promote their development in neurological disease research.",

                    "text": "As the world's population ages, neurological disorders are becoming more prevalent, drawing the attention of researchers worldwide (Deuschl et al., 2020). Over the last 30 years, neurological diseases have led to a dramatic rise in fatalities and disabilities, making them a major global public health issue (Feigin et al., 2020). The production of drugs for brain disorders on a global scale is expected to increase dramatically in the near future. Drug research for neurological disorders has been far from satisfactory when compared to that of other diseases; one of the major hindrances to the successful creation of medications for the management of neurological disorders is the inability for most drugs to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) (Banks, 2016;Yang et al., 2023). The BBB is a complex and delicate structure responsible for controlling the transport of substances between the brain and the blood, preserving ion homeostasis, and protecting brain nerve cells from any potentially harmful chemicals in the blood; unfortunately, it also blocks up to 95% of substances from becoming drugs for neurological disorders (Greene et al., 2019). To improve drug delivery to the brain, researchers have been working to create systems that are capable of efficiently crossing the BBB. To this end, novel drug delivery systems, such as liposomes, nanoparticles, and micelles, have been developed (Pardridge, 2022). Liposomes have become a widely used platform in drug delivery systems for the treatment of neurological disorders due to their enhanced bioavailability and stability, reduction in toxicity, and targeted release (Duong et al., 2023). \n\nCommon modifications that help liposomes cross the BBB include the following: (i) Surface functionalization of liposomes using polyethyleneglycol, which enables a longer circulation of liposomes and avoids rapid reticulo-endothelial system clearance (Lam et al., 2023); (ii) Surface design of bioactive ligands to increase the targeting of liposomes by enabling ligands to specifically bind to receptors or transporters that are highly expressed on brain endothelial cells.",

However, their inability to cross the blood\u2013brain barrier hampers the clinical translation of these therapeutic strategies. Liposomes are nanoparticles composed of lipid bilayers, which can effectively encapsulate drugs and improve drug delivery across the blood\u2013brain barrier and into brain tissue through their targeting and permeability. Therefore, they can potentially treat traumatic and nontraumatic central nervous system diseases. In this review, we outlined the common properties and preparation methods of liposomes, including thin-film hydration, reverse-phase evaporation, solvent injection techniques, detergent removal methods, and microfluidics techniques. Afterwards, we comprehensively discussed the current applications of liposomes in central nervous system diseases, such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease, Huntington\u2019s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, and brain tumors. Most studies related to liposomes are still in the laboratory stage and have not yet entered clinical trials. Additionally, their application as drug delivery systems in clinical practice faces challenges such as drug stability, targeting efficiency, and safety. Therefore, we proposed development strategies related to liposomes to further promote their development in neurological disease research.\n## Introduction\nAs the world's population ages, neurological disorders are becoming more prevalent, drawing the attention of researchers worldwide (Deuschl et al., 2020). Over the last 30 years, neurological diseases have led to a dramatic rise in fatalities and disabilities, making them a major global public health issue (Feigin et al., 2020). The production of drugs for brain disorders on a global scale is expected to increase dramatically in the near future. Drug research for neurological disorders has been far from satisfactory when compared to that of other diseases; one of the major hindrances to the successful creation of medications for the management of neurological disorders is the inability for most drugs to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) (Banks, 2016;Yang et al., 2023). The BBB is a complex and delicate structure responsible for controlling the transport of substances between the brain and the blood, preserving ion homeostasis, and protecting brain nerve cells from any potentially harmful chemicals in the blood; unfortunately, it also blocks up to 95% of substances from becoming drugs for neurological disorders (Greene et al., 2019). To improve drug delivery to the brain, researchers have been working to create systems that are capable of efficiently crossing the BBB. To this end, novel drug delivery systems, such as liposomes, nanoparticles, and micelles, have been developed (Pardridge, 2022). Liposomes have become a widely used platform in drug delivery systems for the treatment of neurological disorders due to their enhanced bioavailability and stability, reduction in toxicity, and targeted release (Duong et al., 2023). \n\nCommon modifications that help liposomes cross the BBB include the following: (i) Surface functionalization of liposomes using polyethyleneglycol, which enables a longer circulation of liposomes and avoids rapid reticulo-endothelial system clearance (Lam et al., 2023); (ii) Surface design of bioactive ligands to increase the targeting of liposomes by enabling ligands to specifically bind to receptors or transporters that are highly expressed on brain endothelial cells.",

Brain aging is a complex process involving multiple mechanisms, including oxidative stress, apoptosis of damaged neuronal cells, chronic inflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction, and research into new therapeutic strategies to delay brain aging has gradually become a research focus in recent years. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been widely used in cell therapy due to their functions such as antioxidative stress, anti-inflammation, and tissue regeneration. However, accompanying safety issues such as immune rejection, tumor development, and pulmonary embolism cannot be avoided. Studies have shown that using exosome derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSC-Exo) for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases is a safe and effective method. It not only has the therapeutic effects of stem cells but also avoids the risks associated with cell therapy. Therefore, exploring new therapeutic strategies to delay normal brain aging from the mechanism of MSC-Exo in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases is feasible. This review summarizes the characteristics of MSC-Exo and their clinical progress in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, aiming to explore the possibility and potential mechanisms of MSC-Exo in reversing brain aging.",

Brain aging is a complex process involving multiple mechanisms, including oxidative stress, apoptosis of damaged neuronal cells, chronic inflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction, and research into new therapeutic strategies to delay brain aging has gradually become a research focus in recent years. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been widely used in cell therapy due to their functions such as antioxidative stress, anti-inflammation, and tissue regeneration. However, accompanying safety issues such as immune rejection, tumor development, and pulmonary embolism cannot be avoided. Studies have shown that using exosome derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSC-Exo) for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases is a safe and effective method. It not only has the therapeutic effects of stem cells but also avoids the risks associated with cell therapy. Therefore, exploring new therapeutic strategies to delay normal brain aging from the mechanism of MSC-Exo in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases is feasible. This review summarizes the characteristics of MSC-Exo and their clinical progress in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, aiming to explore the possibility and potential mechanisms of MSC-Exo in reversing brain aging.\n## Uterus\nEndometrial cancer miR-499 [82] techniques to refine the large-scale manufacturing workflow has emerged as a prevalent research approach [92]. Among these properties, the unique property of MSC-Exo to cross the blood-brain barrier and migrate to the brain lesion area provides the possibility for direct treatment of neurological diseases or drug delivery. Regarding the specific mechanism of crossing, existing studies suggest that it may be the brain microvascular endothelial cells (ECs) that internalize and transport Exo across the BBB through endocytosis, only a small portion of exosomes (Exo) cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) through the paracellular pathway [93](Fig. 3). Although Exo can be uniformly taken up by the brain, the uptake mechanisms of Exo from different sources are diverse and often nonlinear, possibly related to brain-to-blood efflux [94]. Additionally, the complex components in MSC-Exo, such as various proteins, cytokines, and genetic materials, synergistically function through different targeting pathways, which are more efficient compared to single mechanisms [85]. \n\nAs a treatment tool for clinical precision medicine, the tissue distribution and targeting mechanisms of MSC-Exo are also one of the research focuses.

Furthermore, some of the conventional antimicrobial agents are unable to cross certain cell membranes thus, restricting treatment of intracellular pathogens. Therefore, the disease-causing-organisms tend to persist in these cells. However, the emergence of nanoparticle (NP) technology has come with the promising broad spectrum NP-antimicrobial agents due to their vast physiochemical and functionalization properties. In fact, NP-antimicrobial agents are able to unlock the restrictions experienced by conventional antimicrobial agents. This review discusses the status quo of NP-antimicrobial agents as potent broad spectrum antimicrobial agents, sterilization and wound healing agents, and sustained inhibitors of intracellular pathogens. Indeed, the perspective of developing potent NP-antimicrobial agents that carry multiple-functionality will revolutionize clinical medicine and play a significant role in alleviating disease burden.",

                    "text": "Infections of the brain are often very difficult to treat because of the difficulty of most antimicrobial agents to cross the blood brain barrier and inhibit microbial agents [84]. This is due to the fact that the brain is made up of complex cell networks that filter foreign materials, protect and prevent the brain from injuries and diseases [83]. However, some small microbes such as viruses as well as some bacteria are still capable of bypassing and crossing the blood brain barrier [83,84]. Substances entering the brain are mediated through a tight regulated systematic process of membrane transporters [82][83][84]. This tight regulatory system prevents most pharmacological antimicrobial agents from crossing the blood brain barrier and exercising their pharmacological activities [82][83][84]. In this regard nanotechnological antimicrobial agents could bring a novel dimensional approach that is capable of overcoming and bypassing the complex brain cell network, and inhibiting the brain pathogens, thus reducing the burden of microbial brain infections [85]. The NPs can potentially carry and potentially deliver antimicrobial across the blood brain barrier. In fact, it is known that NPs have very small nanosizes that exhibit vast physiochemical multifunctional properties that play a significant role of crossing the blood brain barrier with ease. These features of being able to transiting difficult biological system with ease without disrupting or damaging the cell membranes and sustaining the antimicrobials have made NPs and/or nanomaterials (nano-functionalizedligands) very attractive for biomedical applications [5,86]. For example, a single oral administration of polylactide-co-glycolide NP-encapsulated antituberculosis drugs consisting of rifampicin + isoniazid + pyrazinamide + ethambutol conjugate in murine mice was found to cross the blood brain barrier and sustained for 9 days in the brain [86].",

Yah, G. Simate\n## Abstract\nThe rapid emergence of antimicrobial resistant strains to conventional antimicrobial agents has complicated and prolonged infection treatment and increased mortality risk globally. Furthermore, some of the conventional antimicrobial agents are unable to cross certain cell membranes thus, restricting treatment of intracellular pathogens. Therefore, the disease-causing-organisms tend to persist in these cells. However, the emergence of nanoparticle (NP) technology has come with the promising broad spectrum NP-antimicrobial agents due to their vast physiochemical and functionalization properties. In fact, NP-antimicrobial agents are able to unlock the restrictions experienced by conventional antimicrobial agents. This review discusses the status quo of NP-antimicrobial agents as potent broad spectrum antimicrobial agents, sterilization and wound healing agents, and sustained inhibitors of intracellular pathogens. Indeed, the perspective of developing potent NP-antimicrobial agents that carry multiple-functionality will revolutionize clinical medicine and play a significant role in alleviating disease burden.\n## Nanoparticles penetration of the brain barriers and difficult to reach tissues or cells\nInfections of the brain are often very difficult to treat because of the difficulty of most antimicrobial agents to cross the blood brain barrier and inhibit microbial agents [84]. This is due to the fact that the brain is made up of complex cell networks that filter foreign materials, protect and prevent the brain from injuries and diseases [83]. However, some small microbes such as viruses as well as some bacteria are still capable of bypassing and crossing the blood brain barrier [83,84]. Substances entering the brain are mediated through a tight regulated systematic process of membrane transporters [82][83][84]. This tight regulatory system prevents most pharmacological antimicrobial agents from crossing the blood brain barrier and exercising their pharmacological activities [82][83][84]. In this regard nanotechnological antimicrobial agents could bring a novel dimensional approach that is capable of overcoming and bypassing the complex brain cell network, and inhibiting the brain pathogens, thus reducing the burden of microbial brain infections [85]. The NPs can potentially carry and potentially deliver antimicrobial across the blood brain barrier. In fact, it is known that NPs have very small nanosizes that exhibit vast physiochemical multifunctional properties that play a significant role of crossing the blood brain barrier with ease. These features of being able to transiting difficult biological system with ease without disrupting or damaging the cell membranes and sustaining the antimicrobials have made NPs and/or nanomaterials (nano-functionalizedligands) very attractive for biomedical applications [5,86]. For example, a single oral administration of polylactide-co-glycolide NP-encapsulated antituberculosis drugs consisting of rifampicin + isoniazid + pyrazinamide + ethambutol conjugate in murine mice was found to cross the blood brain barrier and sustained for 9 days in the brain [86].",

These features of being able to transiting difficult biological system with ease without disrupting or damaging the cell membranes and sustaining the antimicrobials have made NPs and/or nanomaterials (nano-functionalizedligands) very attractive for biomedical applications [5,86]. For example, a single oral administration of polylactide-co-glycolide NP-encapsulated antituberculosis drugs consisting of rifampicin + isoniazid + pyrazinamide + ethambutol conjugate in murine mice was found to cross the blood brain barrier and sustained for 9 days in the brain [86].",

LPHNPs were successfully prepared using modified single-step nanoprecipitation technique, loaded with the flavonoid rutin (RU), extracted from the flowers of Calendula officinalis L., and recently proved as a promising anti-Alzheimer. The effect of the critical process parameters (CPP) viz. PLGA amount, W lecithin/W PLGA ratio, and Tween 80 concentration on critical quality attributes (CQA); entrapment, size and size distribution, was statistically analyzed via design of experiments, and optimized using the desirability function. The optimized CPP were maintained while substituting Tween 80 with other PEG-SAA. All hybrid particles exhibited spherical shape with perceptible lipid shells. The biocompatibility of the prepared NPs was confirmed by hemolysis test. The pharmacokinetic assessments, post-intravenous administration to rats, revealed a significant higher RU bioavailability for NPs relative to drug solution. Biodistribution studies proved non-significant differences in RU accumulation within brain, but altered phagocytic uptake among various LPHNPs. The present study endorses the successful development of LPHNPs using PEG-SAA, and confirms the prospective applicability of TPGS and Solutol in enhancing brain delivery.",

Although their etiology is generally known, developing therapeutic interventions for the central nervous system is challenging due to the impermeability of the blood\u2013brain barrier. Thus, the fight against neurological diseases usually struggles \u201cat the gates\u201d of the brain. Flooding the bloodstream with drugs, where only a minor fraction reaches its target therapeutic site, is an inefficient, expensive, and dangerous procedure, because of the risk of side effects at nontargeted sites. Currently, advances in the field of nanotechnology have enabled development of a generation of multifunctional molecular platforms that are capable of transporting drugs across the blood\u2013brain barrier, targeting specific cell types or functional states within the brain, releasing drugs in a controlled manner, and enabling visualization of processes in vivo using conventional imaging systems. The marriage between drug delivery and molecular imaging disciplines has resulted in a relatively new discipline, known as theranostics, which represents the basis of the concept of personalized medicine. In this study, we review the concepts of the blood\u2013brain barrier and the strategies used to traverse/bypass it, the role of nanotechnology in theranostics, the wide range of nanoparticles (with emphasis on liposomes) that can be used as stealth drug carriers, imaging probes and targeting devices for the treatment of neurological diseases, and the targets and targeting strategies envisaged in the treatment of different types of brain pathology.",

Another is to use implantable systems, such as osmotic pumps or enhanced convention devices, for continuous drug infusion. However, surgical approaches are invasive, risky, and cannot be used when the implantable device crosses or targets critical areas of the brain. It is also possible to use such devices to perform intraventricular or intrathecal administration of drugs when involving the cerebrospinal fluid-brain barrier to avoid the blood-brain barrier. Intranasal delivery is also an emerging noninvasive alternative to bypass the blood-brain barrier and facilitates delivery of large charged therapeutic molecules into the brain. 7 Rather than bypassing the blood-brain barrier, it is possible to disrupt it temporarily by opening the tight junctions of endothelial cells. Under these conditions, permeability of the blood vessels in the brain to systemically applied treatments can be increased. 8 A transient disruption of the blood-brain barrier may be achieved by: osmotic shock using mannitol, arabinose, or other hypertonic solutions; acting at specific receptors on endothelial cells with substrates that affect the tight junctions, such as bradykinin receptors; 9 and using magnetic resonance imaging-guided ultrasound in combination with microbubbles of contrast agents to induce focalized openings in small areas of the brain. 10 Opening of the blood-brain barrier may be a dangerous procedure because it can cause hydroelectrolytic changes and suppress the mechanisms that regulate the entrance of substances into the brain. 11 There are alternative methods for distributing drugs inside the brain parenchyma without altering the blood-brain barrier when the aforementioned transport mechanisms are not suitable or unavailable. The first option is to use chemical derivatives or to partially modify the structure of the drug to facilitate traversing of the blood-brain barrier while maintaining drug activity (eg, by adding aliphatic chains to increase lipophilicity). 13 A second possibility is to use prodrugs, ie, reversible compounds that in their native state are not biologically active, but are able to cross the blood-brain barrier and undergo an enzymatic or chemical transformation once in the brain",

Although their etiology is generally known, developing therapeutic interventions for the central nervous system is challenging due to the impermeability of the blood\u2013brain barrier. Thus, the fight against neurological diseases usually struggles \u201cat the gates\u201d of the brain. Flooding the bloodstream with drugs, where only a minor fraction reaches its target therapeutic site, is an inefficient, expensive, and dangerous procedure, because of the risk of side effects at nontargeted sites. Currently, advances in the field of nanotechnology have enabled development of a generation of multifunctional molecular platforms that are capable of transporting drugs across the blood\u2013brain barrier, targeting specific cell types or functional states within the brain, releasing drugs in a controlled manner, and enabling visualization of processes in vivo using conventional imaging systems. The marriage between drug delivery and molecular imaging disciplines has resulted in a relatively new discipline, known as theranostics, which represents the basis of the concept of personalized medicine. In this study, we review the concepts of the blood\u2013brain barrier and the strategies used to traverse/bypass it, the role of nanotechnology in theranostics, the wide range of nanoparticles (with emphasis on liposomes) that can be used as stealth drug carriers, imaging probes and targeting devices for the treatment of neurological diseases, and the targets and targeting strategies envisaged in the treatment of different types of brain pathology.\n## body\nbrain parenchyma to reach the site of pathology.\n\nOne way to circumvent the blood-brain barrier is direct administration of an intraparenchymal injection of the desired substance. Another is to use implantable systems, such as osmotic pumps or enhanced convention devices, for continuous drug infusion. However, surgical approaches are invasive, risky, and cannot be used when the implantable device crosses or targets critical areas of the brain. It is also possible to use such devices to perform intraventricular or intrathecal administration of drugs when involving the cerebrospinal fluid-brain barrier to avoid the blood-brain barrier. Intranasal delivery is also an emerging noninvasive alternative to bypass the blood-brain barrier and facilitates delivery of large charged therapeutic molecules into the brain. 7 Rather than bypassing the blood-brain barrier, it is possible to disrupt it temporarily by opening the tight junctions of endothelial cells. Under these conditions, permeability of the blood vessels in the brain to systemically applied treatments can be increased. 8 A transient disruption of the blood-brain barrier may be achieved by: osmotic shock using mannitol, arabinose, or other hypertonic solutions; acting at specific receptors on endothelial cells with substrates that affect the tight junctions, such as bradykinin receptors; 9 and using magnetic resonance imaging-guided ultrasound in combination with microbubbles of contrast agents to induce focalized openings in small areas of the brain. 10 Opening of the blood-brain barrier may be a dangerous procedure because it can cause hydroelectrolytic changes and suppress the mechanisms that regulate the entrance of substances into the brain. 11 There are alternative methods for distributing drugs inside the brain parenchyma without altering the blood-brain barrier when the aforementioned transport mechanisms are not suitable or unavailable. The first option is to use chemical derivatives or to partially modify the structure of the drug to facilitate traversing of the blood-brain barrier while maintaining drug activity (eg, by adding aliphatic chains to increase lipophilicity). 13 A second possibility is to use prodrugs, ie, reversible compounds that in their native state are not biologically active, but are able to cross the blood-brain barrier and undergo an enzymatic or chemical transformation once in the brain",

The lipid bilayer membrane of exosomes also offers protection against cargo degradation, making them a desirable candidate for drug delivery. However, loading cargo into exosomes remains to be a challenge. Despite various strategies such as incubation, electroporation, sonication, extrusion, freeze\u2013thaw cycling, and transfection that have been developed to facilitate cargo loading, inadequate efficiency still persists. This review offers an overview of current cargo delivery strategies using exosomes and summarizes recent approaches for loading small-molecule, nucleic acid, and protein drugs into exosomes.

However, studies have shown that exosomes derived from various brain cell types (brain endothelial cells [113], microglia [114], astrocytes [115], and choroid plexus epithelial cells [116]) and those originating from metastatic brain tumor [117] can target the brain to varying extents. Designing engineered exosomes with surface-modified targeting peptides represents an effective strategy for achieving brain targeting [118]. For instance, Qu et al., achieved brain-targeted delivery of dopamine by saturating blood exosomes with the drug and subsequently transferring the exosomes into a mouse model of Parkinson's disease. Since transferrin is abundantly expressed on blood-derived exosomes, these exosomes, via interaction between transferrin and transferrin receptors, transported the drug across the BBB, leading to a greater than 15-fold increase in brain distribution of dopamine and better therapeutic efficacy [50]. Meanwhile, Gao et al., loaded berberine into exosomes by sonication, and found, by in vivo and tissue imaging, that these exosomes exhibited positive targeting towards the brain and spinal cord, potentially improving their antiinflammatory effect by first crossing the BBB to enter the brain in vivo, and then circulating through cerebrospinal fluid to the site of spinal cord injury [119].",

Exosomes, which range from 30 to 100 nm in diameter, possess a lipid bilayer and are secreted by various cells. Due to their high biocompatibility, stability, and low immunogenicity, exosomes are favored as cargo carriers. The lipid bilayer membrane of exosomes also offers protection against cargo degradation, making them a desirable candidate for drug delivery. However, loading cargo into exosomes remains to be a challenge. Despite various strategies such as incubation, electroporation, sonication, extrusion, freeze\u2013thaw cycling, and transfection that have been developed to facilitate cargo loading, inadequate efficiency still persists. This review offers an overview of current cargo delivery strategies using exosomes and summarizes recent approaches for loading small-molecule, nucleic acid, and protein drugs into exosomes. With insights from these studies, we provide ideas for more efficient and effective delivery of drug molecules by using exosomes.\n## Brain Targeting Exosomes\nThe human brain is protected by the complex and selective blood-brain barrier (BBB), which prevents the entry of most small-molecule drugs and almost all large-molecule therapeutic drugs, thereby, posing a major obstacle to intracerebral drug delivery [112]. However, studies have shown that exosomes derived from various brain cell types (brain endothelial cells [113], microglia [114], astrocytes [115], and choroid plexus epithelial cells [116]) and those originating from metastatic brain tumor [117] can target the brain to varying extents. Designing engineered exosomes with surface-modified targeting peptides represents an effective strategy for achieving brain targeting [118]. For instance, Qu et al., achieved brain-targeted delivery of dopamine by saturating blood exosomes with the drug and subsequently transferring the exosomes into a mouse model of Parkinson's disease. Since transferrin is abundantly expressed on blood-derived exosomes, these exosomes, via interaction between transferrin and transferrin receptors, transported the drug across the BBB, leading to a greater than 15-fold increase in brain distribution of dopamine and better therapeutic efficacy [50]. Meanwhile, Gao et al., loaded berberine into exosomes by sonication, and found, by in vivo and tissue imaging, that these exosomes exhibited positive targeting towards the brain and spinal cord, potentially improving their antiinflammatory effect by first crossing the BBB to enter the brain in vivo, and then circulating through cerebrospinal fluid to the site of spinal cord injury [119].",

Shang\n## Abstract\nExosomes are tiny vesicles produced by a wide range of cells that contain complex RNA and protein. In the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of illness, they offer great potential. In vitro engineering technique modifies exosomes to produce designed exosomes that include nucleic acids, proteins, and medicines, and are targeted to particular tissues or cells. Their applications range from tumor imaging and gene therapy to vaccine production and regenerative medicine to targeted medication delivery. Many disciplines have promising futures for using this technology. In this review, we\u2019ll look at the potential therapeutic usefulness and use of engineered exosomes in a variety of human illnesses with various systemic manifestations.\n## Nervous system\nThe central nervous system (CNS), which includes the brain and spinal cord, is the body's top organ for regulating and controlling numerous functional processes.

However, it remains the most difficult area for drug development because of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which prevents most of the currently developed drugs from entering the brain parenchyma. The BBB functions as a tight barrier to protect the CNS from potential neurotoxic substances, and regulates the selective transport of specific molecules and nutrients to maintain CNS homeostasis. Water molecules and small ions cross brain capillaries through channels, and small molecules under 500 Da can cross the BBB via passive diffusion [1]. However, macromolecules require specific receptors or transport proteins to facilitate receptor-or adsorptive-mediated transport for entry into the brain parenchyma. The increasing need for new therapeutics for CNS diseases has prompted the investigation of various endogenous transportation mechanisms that can deliver macromolecules across the BBB. The development of novel therapeutics utilizing these transportation pathways has been actively validated in numerous preclinical and clinical studies. \n\nAmong the novel therapeutics, exosomes have recently gained attention because of their role as therapeutic vehicles for delivering various active pharmaceutical ingredients Pharmaceutics 2022, 14, 672 2 of 14 to the brain. Exosomes, or small extracellular vesicles (EVs), are a subtype of EVs defined as single-membrane lipid bilayer vesicles generated by vesicle budding into endosomes that mature into multivesicular bodies or by direct vesicle budding from the plasma membrane [2]. Different subtypes of EVs have been identified based on their size and density, which allows separation by methods such as tangential flow filtration, size exclusion chromatography, and differential centrifugation [3]. Nevertheless, careful interpretation is necessary when analyzing different groups of EVs because most EV purification methods cannot determine EVs based on their biogenesis pathways, but rather isolate subtypes of EVs based on their physical properties.",

The BBB functions as a tight barrier to protect the CNS from potential neurotoxic substances, and regulates the selective transport of specific molecules and nutrients to maintain CNS homeostasis. Water molecules and small ions cross brain capillaries through channels, and small molecules under 500 Da can cross the BBB via passive diffusion [1]. However, macromolecules require specific receptors or transport proteins to facilitate receptor-or adsorptive-mediated transport for entry into the brain parenchyma. The increasing need for new therapeutics for CNS diseases has prompted the investigation of various endogenous transportation mechanisms that can deliver macromolecules across the BBB. The development of novel therapeutics utilizing these transportation pathways has been actively validated in numerous preclinical and clinical studies. \n\nAmong the novel therapeutics, exosomes have recently gained attention because of their role as therapeutic vehicles for delivering various active pharmaceutical ingredients Pharmaceutics 2022, 14, 672 2 of 14 to the brain. Exosomes, or small extracellular vesicles (EVs), are a subtype of EVs defined as single-membrane lipid bilayer vesicles generated by vesicle budding into endosomes that mature into multivesicular bodies or by direct vesicle budding from the plasma membrane [2]. Different subtypes of EVs have been identified based on their size and density, which allows separation by methods such as tangential flow filtration, size exclusion chromatography, and differential centrifugation [3]. Nevertheless, careful interpretation is necessary when analyzing different groups of EVs because most EV purification methods cannot determine EVs based on their biogenesis pathways, but rather isolate subtypes of EVs based on their physical properties.",

            "text": "The polyelectrolyte microcapsules fabricated by the LbL-technique have been demonstrated as an efficient delivery system for targeting different tissue and cell types. The suitability for this type of carriers has been confirmed in animals in vivo through either systemic application [44][45][46][47] or during local injections of the microcapsule suspension into the targeted tissue [24]. However, there have been only a few attempts to explore the use of biodegradable LbL-microcapsules in the central nervous system, especially with respect to the brain where multiple and distinct cell types are densely inter-connected with high spatial specificity. Therefore, our aim was to examine the potential of LbL-microcapsules for localised delivery of neurotrophins to central neurons, a potential tool to enhance guidance and formation of functional neuronal connections. This context differs from that of systemic application which envisages blood-brain barrier permeability followed by cell targeting.\n\nOur strategy took advantage of the previous work in which fabrication protocols, release properties, and biodegradation in situ and in vivo for the LbL-fabricated microcapsules have been established [12,23,24,33]. Thus, the functional data obtained here in neuronal-astrocyte co-cultures, together with the previous reports pertaining to the encapsulation per se, suggest that LbL microcapsules meet the key requirements for applications targeting brain neurons. These include (i) high biocompatibility (no excitotoxicity) for all constitutive components of the microcapsule, (ii) gradual, prolonged release of the encapsulated compound of interest (including low molecular weight substances), and (iii) biodegradability (safe use). Monitoring primary hippocampal neurons in the present work has revealed no signs of excitotoxicity in the presence of microcapsules, at any stage of neuronal development and morphogenesis in vitro. Again, this is consistent with no effects of empty LbL-microcapsules (of the same composition) on primary hippocampal neurons or on peripheral nerve cells in vivo [24]. In addition, numerous studies have reported no toxicity produced by the Lb",

            "text": "The brain is important organ, it is protected with Blood Brain Barrier and it is very difficult to target it, unless using modified drug delivery system. The blood-brain barrier is made up of endothelial cells, which are connected by tight junctions. The blood-brain barrier only receives the material like water, some gases, and lipid-soluble molecules by passive diffusion method, also the selective transport of molecules such as glucose and amino acids. Astrocytes are formed blood-brain barrier. BBB is one such barrier which separates but not isolates brain from all other body components. [1][2][3] The decades of research in the development of drugs delivery for brain disease, crossing of blood brain barrier is a key obstacle. So the BBB is a life saving supporting media that protect brain against the toxic substance that circulate in the blood stream, its existence is a severe limitation to the delivery of most of the drugs to the brain because they do not cross the BBB in sufficient amounts. Many serious CNS disorders of the brain such as Alzheimer disease, stroke/neuro protection, brain and spinal cord injury, brain cancer, HIV infection of the brain, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington disease and childhood inborn genetic errors affecting the brain, Parkinson disease and multiple sclerosis (MS), to reach the therapeutic drug level in the brain. A novel delivery system such as Nanoparticulate system as drug carriers with high loading capacity and small particle size, which bypass the Reticule endothelial system (RES), are considered as suitable delivery system 4 . To study BBB have provides new opportunities for increasing drug delivery to the CNS. Different techniques are used for targeting the blood brain barrier for drug delivery to the brain include carrier system, prodrug approach, liposomes, nanoparticles, dendrimers.\n\nBasal membrane and brain cells, such as pericytes and astrocytes, surrounding the endothelial cells further form and maintain an enzymatic and physical barrier known as the blood-brain barrier (BBB). BBB tight junctions are formed between endothelial cells in brain capillaries, thus preventing paracellular transport of molecules into the brain.

            "text": "Neurotrophic peptides may have considerable potential in the treatment of acute and chronic neurological diseases. However, systemic delivery is limited by significant systemic side effects, short plasma half-life or poor bloodbrain barrier passage. Therefore, local administration into the central nervous system (CNS) has been proposed [1,2]. However, this drug delivery route, bypassing the blood brain barrier, has been challenged, because substances are rapidly removed from the brain through physiological cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) outflow pathways [3][4][5].\n\nEx vivo gene therapy using encapsulated cell biodelivery has been suggested as a way to achieve a more sustained local delivery of proteins into the CNS. Bankable, non-autologous cell lines cells can be used, that have been genetically engineered to produce the protein. To prevent host versus graft reaction, encapsulation of those cells with permselective membranes has been introduced, to allow diffusional nutrition and the outward passage of the recombinant protein [6]. Encapsulation has been achieved with different techniques, using either hollow fibers or spherical polymeric microcapsules. Hollow fiber encapsulated cells were investigated in clinical trials after implantation into the lumbar subarachnoid space in chronic pain [7] and ALS patients [8] as well as into the lateral ventricle in Huntington's disease patients [9]. While lumbar implantation resulted in excellent cell viability and significant lumbar CSF levels of the secreted soluble factors [7], ventricular implantation has shown disappointing results with variable numbers of surviving cells along with a markedly low secretory rate [9]. Spherical microcapsules may achieve improved viability rates because their shape provides almost ideal diffusion properties which can improve the nutrition of encapsulated cells [10,11].\n\nGlucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a neuroprotective substance which has been shown to protect neurons from amyloid toxicity in vitro as well as in vivo in Alzheimer's disease models [12,13]. Recently, in a rat model of traumatic brain injury, our group has demonstrated similar neuroprotective properties where GLP-1 was delivered",

The nanoparticles (about 2 nm in core diameter, hydrodynamic diameter 3-4 nm) were able to enter the brain spheroid, driven by the outside-inside concentration gradient. However, the blood-brain barrier regulated the particle uptake. This regulation (i.e. the opening of the blood-brain barrier) was slower than the subsequent diffusion into the center of the spheroid. This led to an accumulation of the particles in the center of the spheroid while only few particles were observed during the passage across the pericyte/endothelial cell layer. In contrast, the dissolved FAM dye was able to enter the spheroid only to a small extent, indicating that ultrasmall nanoparticles are preferentially crossing the blood-brain barrier by a hitherto unknown transport mechanism. A prolonged hypoxia for 24 h compromised the blood-brain barrier so that both the nanoparticles and the dissolved dye could enter more easily. \n\nWe have used 70 kDa FITC-dextran as reference that has often been used as model compound to check the integrity of the BBB 6,10 . Our results show that the BBB is intact in the spheroid. 70 kDa dextran has a hydrodynamic diameter of about 12 nm. Thus, it is larger than the gold nanoparticles (metal core diameter 2 nm; hydrodynamic diameter 3-4 nm) 30 , therefore dextran and gold nanoparticles do not have the same size. However, the observation that the nanoparticles are entering the spheroids is independent from the size of the www.nature.com/scientificreports/ dextran used. Unfortunately, no information can be derived from the light microscopic images about a possible agglomeration of the nanoparticles. Their diameter of about 2-4 nm (core diameter/hydrodynamic diameter) is much less than the resolution of the confocal laser scanning microscope. Therefore, we cannot distinguish individual particles.",

            "text": "The brain is a complex, heterogenous, and extremely metabolically active organ. Under resting conditions, the brain receives a relatively large proportion of cardiac output, and is responsible for 20% of total body oxygen consumption despite only making up a small fraction of the total body mass of higher mammals (1). Neuronal synaptic activity is responsible for consuming 75-80% of energy produced in the brain (2). Precise regulation of the flux of biological substances into and out of the brain is fundamental to meeting the brain's dynamic metabolic demands, preserving physiologic neural signaling, and isolating the brain from exposure to blood-borne insults (3,4). \n\nThe blood-brain barrier (BBB) plays a significant role in maintaining normal microenvironmental conditions in the brain by selectively allowing the influx of ions, essential nutrients and energy necessary for neural function while simultaneously buffering the interstitial fluid (IF) of the brain against fluctuations in the molecular composition of the plasma, exporting metabolic waste products, and limiting the entry of toxins and other exogenous compounds from the blood (3). Several structural properties of the BBB distinguish it from the systemic vasculature and contribute to its barrier functions including a high transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER), a low rate of molecular transport via transcytosis, and severely restricted paracellular permeability (3-5). Although these gatekeeping functions of the BBB have evolved to increase the efficiency of synaptic and neural network communications requisite to the performance of complex functions and behaviors, the selectivity of the BBB has been a major obstacle to the effective systemic delivery of therapeutic agents to the brain, with <5% of small molecule pharmaceuticals effectively crossing the BBB (1,(4)(5)(6). \n\nHere we review the structure and function of the BBB and recent technologic innovations that have been developed to enhance the delivery of therapeutic agents to the central nervous system (CNS) (6-8). These advancements, as well as their limitations, are illustrated through clinical applications in companion animals with naturally occurring neurological diseases.",

Various physical barriers between blood and the CNS, including the blood-brain barrier (BBB), protect the CNS against potentially harmful endogenous and exogenous substances (1-4). A network of brain tissue capillaries which form a structural and chemical barrier between the brain and systemic circulation, are composed of specialized endothelial cells that lack pores to allow rapid exchange of molecules and are connected by extensive tight junctions that form a high-resistance barrier and severely restrict cell permeability. Under normal physiological conditions, this low BBB permeability prevents transport of bacteria and restricts movement of 100% of large molecules and 98% of small molecules from the systemic circulation to the brain (5,6). In order to enter the brain, molecules need to be less than 400 Daltons and hydrophobic. Too large or too hydrophilic molecules can pass BBB as substrates of active efflux transporters which are important determinants of drug distribution to, and elimination from, the CNS (7). \n\nNeuropharmaceutical research is associated with a significant challenge which is the requirement of neuropharmaceuticals to cross blood-CNS barriers, since they present a major obstacle for effective delivery of potential CNS medicines (4, 8). A few strategies have been proposed to disrupt the BBB for drug delivery, including trans-cranial approach using neurosurgery-based intrathecal catheters, bypassing the BBB via the olfactory route, shrinkage of the endothelial cells and opening of the tight junctions using various compounds (e.g., mannitol, ethanol or dimethylsulfoxide, alkylating agents, etc.) (6,9). However, several major disadvantages are associated with each of these strategies. In parallel, for those drug candidates that are not capable of successfully crossing the blood-CNS barriers, there is the possibility of transvascular delivery to the brain.",

            "text": "Therefore, it is necessary to protect it against the contamination with environmental and foreign substances which could lead to changes in the inner and outer concentrations of neuronal cells and subsequently to impairments in nerve conduction and dysfunctions in the body control processes [6]. The blood-brain barrier is the structure responsible for the protection of the brain, acting as a local gateway against the circulating toxins and cells [7] through a selective permeability system. Hence, the delivery systems for the treatment of brain diseases should have the capacity to cross the blood-brain barrier without causing immune responses. However, the physiological function of the blood-brain barrier is the key challenge for the delivery of pharmaceutical drugs to the brain, which represents the main reason for complications in the existing treatment strategies and for the numerous research studies focusing on the development of novel drug delivery systems for the treatment of brain-associated diseases [8]. The principal pathways for crossing the blood-brain barrier are through paracellular transport, between endothelial cells, and through transcellular transport, involving passive or active mechanisms, across the luminal side of the endothelial cells, through the cytoplasm, and subsequently across the abluminal side, into the brain interstitium [9]. Although there are multiple crossing pathways, approximately 98% of small molecules and most large molecules are unable to reach the brain through the blood-brain barrier [10]. \n\nNanotechnology, the emerging field that encompasses knowledge from multiple disciplines including chemistry, physics, engineering, and biology, implicates the development and modification of materials within the size range of 1-100 nm in at least one dimension [11][12][13]. Additionally, nanotechnology represents the capacity to understand, manipulate, and control the matter at the level of individual atoms and molecules [14]. Therefore, the implication of nanotechnology for the development of non-invasive drug delivery strategies could lead to the design of novel and improved formulations to enhance the delivery of therapeutic agents across the blood-brain barrier [3,[15][16][17][18].",

            "text": "Central nervous system (CNS) disorders, including neurodegenerative, neoplastic, and neuropsychiatric disorders are becoming increasingly prevalent around the world due to rapidly aging populations (Hebert et al., 2013). Treatment of various CNS disorders has always been a challenging task, despite the rapid development of multiple novel treatment strategies and drug approaches in recent years. Of these, development of efficient brain targeted drug delivery system is crucial for successful therapy of CNS diseases. However, the presence of the complex blood brain barrier (BBB) is one of the major obstacles that limits therapeutics entry to the CNS region (Jafari et al., 2019). The BBB, comprises brain microvascular endothelial cells, pericytes, and astrocytic end-feet, acts as a selective physical barrier that prevents approximately 98% of small molecular weight agents and nearly 100% of macromolecules, from crossing from the blood stream into the brain tissues (Pardridge, 2005;Jafari et al., 2019;Wong et al., 2019). \n\nConsequently, numerous studies have proposed promising strategies to improve the delivery of therapeutic agents to the brain by circumventing or overcoming the BBB during the last decades. These strategies include intracerebroventricular injections (Lopachev et al., 2019), convection enhanced delivery (Zhan and Wang, 2018), inhibition of efflux transporters (Sanchez-Covarrubias et al., 2014), chemical modification (Al-Ahmady, 2018), and the application of hyperosmotic agents (Patel et al., 2009) or focused ultrasound (Dauba et al., 2020;Lin et al., 2020;Wu et al., 2021a), and so on. However, the limitation of these administration routes is marred by safety concerns, invasive, and erratic efficacy.",

Many of these neurological disorders require treatment. However, the human body's blood-brain barrier (BBB) tightly regulates transport of substances from the blood to the brain to precisely control CNS homeostasis (Daneman and Prat, 2015), often rendering oral and parenteral drug administration ineffective (Calias et al., 2014;Pizzichelli et al., 2017). To overcome the BBB, two prominent strategies have been proposed: (1) the development of drugs that can pass through the barrier; and (2) utilizing alternative drug delivery routes, such as intracerebroventricular, intranasal, intra-cisterna magna, and intrathecal drug delivery (ITDD) (Calias et al., 2014).",

Thus, delivering drugs across the blood-brain barrier is an active research area in immunology, oncology, and neurology; moreover, novel methods are urgently needed to expand therapeutic options for central nervous system pathologies. While previous strategies have focused on small molecules that modulate blood-brain barrier permeability or penetrate the barrier, there is an increased focus on biomedical devices\u2014external or implanted\u2014for improving drug delivery. Here, we review device-assisted drug delivery across the blood\u2013brain barrier, emphasizing its application in glioblastoma, an aggressively malignant primary brain cancer in which the blood-brain barrier plays a central role. We examine the blood-brain barrier and its features in glioblastoma, emerging models for studying the blood-brain barrier, and device-assisted methods for crossing the blood-brain barrier. We conclude by presenting methods to monitor the blood-brain barrier and paradigms for combined cross-BBB drug delivery.",

            "text": "Biological barriers block foreign substances to maintain homeostasis but also prevent drugs from reaching a lesion. When administered orally, most drugs are unable to enter the bloodstream because of the intestinal barrier. When treating brainrelated diseases, drugs have difficulties entering the brain due to the blood-brain barrier and instead reach other organs, leading to potentially severe side effects. 100 Based on the phospholipid surface and nanostructure, PDVEs can transport a drug through a biological barrier and improve the bioavailability of the drug. \n\nOne prominent example showcasing the potential of PDVEs in surmounting biological barriers is their application in delivering dexamethasone (Dex) for neuroinflammation-related disease treatment. Dex is known for its anti-inflammatory properties, but its therapeutic potential is limited due to its poor bioavailability and inability to cross the blood-brain barrier efficiently. Researchers utilized Allium tuberosum-derived PDVEs to encapsulate Dex. Upon administration, these PDVEs were shown high efficiency in crossing the blood-brain barrier, and delivered Dex directly to the affected brain regions. This led to a significant alleviation of inflammation in microglial, demonstrating the potency of PDVEs as drug delivery vehicles for brain diseases. 101 o verify the ability of PDVEs to penetrate the intestinal barrier, grape-derived vesicles (GDVEs) were stained with fluorescent dyes. The results showed that GDVEs accumulated in the intestine during the first 6 h after oral administration and were decreased within 48 h. 35 Most brain cancers require surgical intervention since the restrictive bloodbrain barrier usually prevents drugs from reaching a therapeutic concentration. However, it was found that GfDVEs carrying miR17 could significantly inhibit brain cancer growth, without any toxic effects. 92 Notably, although PDVEs could cross biological barriers, they could not penetrate the placental barrier when injected intravenously into pregnant mice, suggesting the high safety of PDVEs in pregnant women. 102 Taken together, PDVEs act as intelligent Trojan horses, encasing a drug and crossing a biological barrier to transport it to the lesion. Meanwhile, they are safe for the fetus in the uterus.",

            "text": "The CNS and related diseases represent a serious health burden globally [26]. The therapy to treat CNS disorders is mainly hampered by the blood-brain barrier (BBB). BBB is a highly organized arrangement of the vasculature that has evolved naturally to restrict the entrance of molecules into the brain and to prevent the brain from potentially harmful microbes, to prevent microbials entering the bloodstream. Following these restrictions, most known therapies face the same hindrance from the BBB in entering the CNS and targeting the site of infection [27], whereas the BBB slowly allows the passage of nutrients and other related molecules with a smaller size which are a necessary function of the CNS [28]. \n\nDespite enduring efforts to deliver medicinal drugs to the brain tissue, these treatment regimens are compromised by low bioavailability due to the blood-brain barrier (BBB), a natural protective layer consisting of capillary endothelial cells, pericytes, and tight junctions [29]. This near-impermeable barrier impedes the entry of most macromolecules and allows only the minutest particles (<400 Da) to cross into the nerve tissue. Indeed, less than 5% of conventional therapeutic molecules in various stages of pharmaceutical development may penetrate this physiological barrier [30]. Therefore, CNS-targeted natural product formulations in nanocarriers hold infinite promise. Evidence suggests that nutraceuticals and phytochemicals exert therapeutic effects in neurological diseases, owing to their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective mechanisms [31,32]. Coupled with nanoscale delivery systems which improve solubility, enhance retention rates [33], and with the ability to permeate through the BBB (Figure 1), there is hope yet for effective treatment of neurological disorders. The following topic discusses two herbal compounds, curcumin and ginseng, and their significant potential for use in neurotherapeutics through nano-encapsulation.",

            "text": "More than a century ago, Paul Ehrlich demonstrated in a set of dye experiments the lack of permeability of intracerebral vessels to albumin-binding dyes and therefore postulated a barrier between blood and neuronal tissue. Indeed, transport across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is tightly regulated by at least four different cells that comprise the brain microvasculature: the endothelial cell and highly specific tight junctions between them, the pericytes which share with the endothelial cells a common capillary basement membrane, the astrocytic foot processes which cover the capillaries, and nerve endings which innervate the vessels. Importantly, dysfunction of the BBB occurs during numerous common neurological diseases, including stroke, epilepsy, trauma, tumors, and infectious and degenerative diseases. While it has been long recognized that BBB dysfunction is associated with brain diseases, only recently it has been suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of neuronal networks dysfunction and degeneration. In this special issue clinical and experimental evidence for the involvement of BBB dysfunction in the pathogenesis of seizures and epilepsy (N. Marchi et al. \u201cthe etiological role of blood-brain barrier dysfunction in seizure disorders\u201d and L. M.

Serlin et al. in \u201cVascular pathology and blood-brain barrier disruption in cognitive and psychiatric complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus\u201d) is given. Experimental evidence points to the mechanisms involved, which most importantly seems to include astroglial activation and disturbance of the extracellular milieu, specifically altered homeostasis of water and electrolytes (V.

It is also of utmost importance to understand the physicochemical properties of the said drug and how it engages the BBB to avoid undesired side effects. Since fewer than 5% of the tested molecules can pass through the BBB, drug development pertaining to brain-related disorders takes inordinately long to develop. Furthermore, in most cases it is also unsuccessful for allied reasons. Several drug delivery systems (DDSs) have shown excellent potential in drug delivery across the BBB while demonstrating minimal side effects. This mini-review summarizes key features of the BBB, recapitulates recent advances in our understanding of the BBB, and highlights existing strategies for the delivery of drug to the brain parenchyma.",

            "text": "The blood-brain barrier is one of the most difficult barriers for drugs/agents to cross in the body. Brain delivery is, therefore, still a major challenge. To solve this problem, various drug delivery systems, including EV-based systems, have been developed [69]. Various cells can produce EVs that can target the brain cells. For example, EVs from mesenchymal stem cells in different brain pathologies, including strokes, autism, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease specifically targeted and accumulated in the brains of pathologically relevant murine models [70]. EVs secreted by monocytes and macrophages were shown to avoid entrapment in mononuclear phagocytes whilst being readily taken up by neuronal cells [71]. The brain cells themselves also secreted EVs to communicate between cells and to deliver bioactive molecules to recipient cells to modulate cell functions such as M2 microglia-derived EVs [72]. However, not all of these EVs efficiently passed the BBB without engineering, although they could target the brain cells. Compared with these EVs, RBCEVs can actively target the brain without surface modification, and are generally produced more easily [73,74]. It has been shown that RBCEVs without any modification move through the BBB based on the transferrin-TfR interaction and the formation of a transferrin dimer [73] (Figure 2). RBCEVs are \u03b1-syn-rich EVs and have been shown to favor a BBB crossing under inflammatory conditions provoked by the peripheral administration of lipopolysaccharide [74]. It has been reported that non-modified RBC exosomes carrying dopamine showed a 10-fold increase in dopamine in the brain. \n\nThe brain-targeting efficiency of RBCEVs may be further improved by reducing offtarget accumulation such as the liver [67]. For instance, in order to reduce toxicity to nontarget tissues, RBCEVs can be modified to have additional RVG-targeting capabilities [75].",

            "text": "Peptide oral administration is a hard goal to reach, especially if the brain is the target site. The purpose of the present study was to set up a vehicle apt to promote oral absorption of the neuropeptide dalargin (DAL), allowing it to cross the intestinal mucosal barrier, resist enzymatic degradation, and transport drugs to the brain after crossing the blood\u2013brain barrier. Therefore, a chitosan quaternary ammonium derivative was synthesized and conjugated with methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin to prepare DAL-medicated nanoparticles (DAL-NP). DAL-NP particle size was 227.7 nm, zeta potential +8.60 mV, encapsulation efficiency 89%. DAL-NP protected DAL from degradation by chymotrypsin or pancreatin and tripled DAL degradation time compared to non-encapsulated DAL. Use of DAL-NP was safe for either Caco-2 or bEnd.3 cells, with the latter selected as a blood\u2013brain barrier model. DAL-NP could also cross either the Caco-2 or bEnd.3 monolayer by the transepithelial route. The results suggest a potential DAL-NP ability to transport to the brain a DAL dose fraction administered orally, although in vivo experiments will be needed to confirm the present data obtained in vitro.",

            "text": "In addition to the effect of pinocytosis and phagocytosis of MPS on the circulation time of drug granule carriers, various barriers in the body also block the absorption and circulation of drug particles carriers. The common physiological barriers of drugs include blood-brain barrier [75][76][77][78] , blood-retinal barrier [79] , blood-pancreas barrier [80] , blood-gas barrier [81] , blood-placental barrier [82] and gastrointestinal mucus barriers [83 ,84] . At present, the blood-brain barrier is a hot spot in the research. Since the loss of life and disability caused by non-fatal cases of central nervous system diseases impose a heavy burden on society, the delivery of nanoparticles into the brain is particularly worthy of attention. The cells in the blood-brain barrier have the characteristics of no perforation and low endocytic activity [85] . Therefore, the drug or carrier with a suitable particle size is one of the key factors that determine whether it can pass through the blood-brain barrier. Maksymilian et al. compared the situation of 100, 200 and 500 nm polystyrene spherical nanoparticles crossing the blood-brain barrier [86] . The results of the study found that different particle sizes have a non-monotonic dependence across the blood-brain barrier, that the transport of particles with a particle size of 200 nm is better than 100 and 500 nm. The exact reason for this non-monotonic dependence is unclear. Particles of different sizes may cross through cells along different paths. In addition, Mucus is the body's protective coating against foreign invaders, but it is a major barrier for non-invasive administration of drugs. Fig. 3 shows that the purple particles are bigger than the mesh space between mucus fibers, so it cannot penetrate the mucus layer. On the other hand, the green particles are smaller than mesh space, thus could theoretically diffuse through the pore. However, the actual situation is that, in the mucus layer, the particles will absorb the mucin or non-mucin proteins or other mucus constituents onto their surfaces. As a result, the spread of the green particles will be slowed down [87] .",

            "text": "One of the main challenges in treating brain diseases is to overcome barriers protecting the brain in order to deliver therapeutics to the central nervous system (CNS) [1]. For decades, barriers, such as the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier, have presented obstacles to scientists [2]. One approach for treating CNS diseases and overcoming the need for surgical intervention, which has the risk of complications, is harnessing established modes of brain communication. Brain cells interact in several ways -directly through membrane-cytoplasmic cell contacts via gap junctions [3], nanotubes [4], and receptor-ligand contact [5] with neighboring cells; or indirectly, for example, through the release of hormones [6], neurotransmitters [7], gliotransmitters [8], proteins [9], and releases of membrane-enclosed vesicles [10,11]. Brain-derived vesicles consist of exosomes, microvesicles, apoptotic bodies, and membrane-associated microparticles, collectively referred to as extracellular vesicles (EVs) [12,13]. A heterogeneous population of CNS-derived EVs are secreted into the extracellular space and can be retrieved in biofluids [14], including blood [15,16] and CSF [11,17]. EVs are able to pass the BBB but do so at various rates and by a diverse range of mechanisms depending on their cell of origin [18,19], allowing them either to enter the brain from the periphery or to exit via the circulation, CSF or the lymphatic system, supporting their potential to be exploited as biomarkers or therapeutic carriers, respectively [20,21].\n\nEVs (typically ~50-100 nm in diameter) encapsulate a mixture of cargo types, including proteins, lipids, DNA, and various RNA species. The EV shell consists of cell membranederived phospholipids [22]. In the CNS, EVs have been shown to be released from neurons [23], astrocytes [24], microglia [25], oligodendrocytes [",

These traumas can prompt rapid acute and long-term damage to neuronal tissue and function. Successful treatment of brain injuries is limited due to the need for swift diagnosis and difficulties in delivering therapeutics past the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Additional complications arise due to the myriad of changes that take place following brain damages. MSC-Exos are not only capable of crossing the BBB through intravenous or intranasal delivery, but also have beneficial effects in treating chronic inflammation in and promoting healthy healing, making them a potential therapeutic for complex brain injuries (Figure 6) [310][311][312][313]. \n\nCells 2021, 10, x FOR PEER REVIEW 22 of 50",

            "text": "Delivering drugs into the brain: A major challenge in the pharmacologic treatment of neurodegenerative diseases is the achievement of efficient drug delivery into the brain. Brain delivery requires that an intravenous drug crosses the blood-brain barrier, which is formed by the endothelial cells of the brain capillary vessels. To protect the brain from toxic substances, the blood-brain barrier contains tight junctions between adjacent cells that ensure a remarkably low permeability to blood molecules (Abbott et al., 2010). Consequently, this essential protective barrier complicates intravenous drugs from reaching the brain. This limitation has been frequently overlooked in drug research for neurodegenerative diseases (Pardridge, 2019). In addition, the P-glycoprotein, an active efflux system of the brain capillary vessels, pumps small molecules out of its endothelial cells, further complicating their crossing of the blood-brain barrier (Pardridge, 2019). Thus, drugs that are P-glycoprotein substrates will face an additional obstacle to their brain delivery. \n\nDrug injection into the cerebrospinal fluid, which surrounds the surface of the brain, allows the drug to reach its surface, but not to achieve a homogeneous distribution throughout this organ (Pardridge, 2019). This goal has been pursued through the exploitation of transport systems of the endothelial cells in the blood-brain barrier. Small molecules failing to diffuse through the membranes of these cells can be engineered to interact with small-molecule transporters on those membranes, including the GLUT1 glucose transporter (Pardridge, 2019;Figure 1B, left). \n\nEndothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier also contain transporters for peptides and proteins, including the insulin receptor (Abbott et al., 2010). They work by forming a vesicle around the protein or peptide and translocating it across the endothelial cell. A therapeutic protein or peptide can be fused to a monoclonal antibody that mimics a substrate of one of these transporters, yielding a molecular Trojan horse (Pardridge, 2019). Alternatively, a gene coding for the therapeutic protein or peptide can be provided through gene therapy.",

However, the presence of BBB complicates the pharmacotherapy for CNS disorders as the most chemical drugs and biopharmaceuticals have been impeded to enter the brain. Insufficient drug delivery into the brain leads to low therapeutic efficacy as well as aggravated side effects due to the accumulation in other organs and tissues. Recent breakthrough in materials science and nanotechnology provides a library of advanced materials with customized structure and property serving as a powerful toolkit for targeted drug delivery. In-depth research in the field of anatomical and pathological study on brain and BBB further facilitates the development of brain-targeted strategies for enhanced BBB crossing. In this review, the physiological structure and different cells contributing to this barrier are summarized. Various emerging strategies for permeability regulation and BBB crossing including passive transcytosis, intranasal administration, ligands conjugation, membrane coating, stimuli-triggered BBB disruption, and other strategies to overcome BBB obstacle are highlighted. Versatile drug delivery systems ranging from organic, inorganic, and biologics-derived materials with their synthesis procedures and unique physio-chemical properties are summarized and analyzed. This review aims to provide an up-to-date and comprehensive guideline for researchers in diverse fields, offering perspectives on further development of brain-targeted drug delivery system.",

            "text": "The key element that makes the use of GQDs in the biomedical and neuroscientific fields crucial, is the increasing amount of evidence indicating their capability of crossing biological barriers [73]. In particular, the greatest challenge to date for overtaking biological barriers is represented by the blood-brain barrier (BBB) (Figure 4A). From an anatomical point of view, the BBB is constituted by an inner layer of endothelial cells with tight junctional complexes, pericytes, astrocytes and neurons. The interaction of these cellular populations is called neurovascular unit [74]. The BBB works as a critical checkpoint between the CNS and the bloodstream. On one hand, BBB prevents harmful substances from entering the brain and, on the other hand, provides the essential nutrients for neurons. The restrictive nature of the BBB represents an obstacle for drug delivery to CNS [75]. Indeed, the BBB can be considered as a dynamic interface that controls the influx and efflux of a large variety of substances, including potentially useful drugs for a wide range of brain diseases, thus making most of the current therapies ineffective [76,77]. Evidence has demonstrated that less than 2% of small-molecule drugs can cross the BBB, though these drugs possess a characteristic molecular weight below 400 Da [75] and are specifically surface-modified for the uptake [78]. Due to the inability to adequately deliver therapeutic agents across the BBB, current treatments for CNS diseases remain limited. \n\nSeveral QDs have been designed to modulate or bypass the BBB for the delivery of therapeutics (Table 2). Xu and coworkers used transferrin-bioconjugated quantum rods to pass through an in vitro model of the BBB with endothelial cells and pericytes [79] (Figure 4B). These two cellular populations were cultured on a semiporous membrane, and by laser scanning confocal microscopy where the authors measured an increase in the fluorescence intensity due to QDs in the lower medium, corresponding to a decrease in the fluorescence of the upper layer. In neuroinflammatory conditions, the disruption of the integrity of the BBB is mediated by metalloproteinases.",

            "text": "There is an increasing demand for effective delivery strategies for the brain because advances in pharmaceutical technology have resulted in treatment opportunities for neurological diseases. Intravenous (IV) delivery is a wellestablished approach to introduce drugs or therapeutic genetic materials throughout the body since this route has minimal limitations on administration dose and accommodates repeated administration (128). For these applications, nonviral vectors offer the potential advantage over viral vectors of avoiding an immune response. However, nonviral gene carriers administered intravenously must overcome several obstacles before successfully reaching the brain. Interaction with serum proteins in the blood circulation compromises targeting and therapeutic efficacy of nonviral gene carriers by eclipsing targeting ligands or mediating opsonization and clearance from the circulation. Moreover, aggregation of vectors in the bloodstream can result in embolism in the capillary beds of the lung. Tethering hydrophilic groups such as dextran, PEG, or poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) to nanoparticles helps prevent binding with serum proteins and resulting aggregation (129). \n\nThe BBB, consisting of endothelial cells connected by tight junctions in the brain capillaries, poses a formidable challenge against the effective delivery of therapeutic genes to the CNS by severely limiting extravasation of delivery vectors (99,(130)(131)(132). The tight-junctions between endothelial cells and the physical and molecular barriers of the adjacent pericytes and astrocytic endfeet can be temporarily permeabilized by utilizing osmotic disruption with intracarotid hypertonic mannitol (133) or vasoactive compounds (134,135). However, the safety of this approach has been raised as a concern because BBB disruption may cause brain toxicity due to leaking plasma proteins, thus potentially causing pathological changes (136)(137)(138). \n\nReceptor-mediated transcytosis (RMT) has been investigated as an alternative strategy for crossing the BBB. Brainspecific systemic delivery systems based on antibody-and PEGconjugated liposomes, called PEGylated immunoliposomes (PIL), has been extensively explored by the Pardridge group (139)(140)(141)(142).",

            "text": "Neurotherapeutics are classes of drugs used in the treatment of brain or central nervous system disorders. The effectiveness of these actives is generally compromised due to failure reaching the site of action sufficiently. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is considered the most dominant physiological barrier impeding the passage of neuropharmaceuticals to the brain cells. It is a highly fortified membrane system, composed of specialized capillary endothelial cells, that protects the brain from extraneous organisms and harmful chemicals, and supplies the brain with the nutrients required (Salunkhe et al., 2015). Overcoming the difficulty in crossing BBB is the key strategy for efficient delivery of therapeutic molecules to the brain. \n\nSeveral delivery approaches were implemented aiming to target drugs to the brain via enhancing their transport across BBB. The application of nanotechnology coupled with surfactant coating is one of these propitious tactics. \n\nFor a long time, nanoparticle (NP)-mediated drug transport to the brain has been governed by particle coating with surfactants. The surfactant Tween V R 80 (polyethylene glycol sorbitan monooleate) is considered the gold standard effectively crossing BBB. The fact is due to the preferential adsorption of apolipoprotein E (Apo E), present in blood, on NP surfaces coated with Tween 80, rendering particles resembling the low density lipoproteins (LDL), hence interacting with LDL receptors on BBB and enhancing their cellular uptake via receptor-mediated transcytosis mechanism (Gessner et al., 2000;G\u20ac oppert & M\u20ac uller, 2003). Other surfactants were investigated for their capabilities to transport drugs across BBB, from which D-a-Tocopherol polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS) and Solutol V R HS 15 (polyethylene glycol-15-hydroxy stearate) (Lamprecht & Benoit, 2006;Wa Kasongo, 2010;Agrawa et al., 2017;Meng et al., 2017).",

            "text": "Decades of dedicated efforts have led to scientific advances in understanding the physiology of many diseases and development of a wide array of therapeutic materials. To fulfil their intended purpose, therapeutic materials must have adequate pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics that can allow them to accumulate in the diseased site in their therapeutically effective concentration. Advances in the treatment of infections or malignancies residing in peripheral tissues are growing at a faster pace compared to their CNS-associated equivalents. In large part, this phenomenon is due to the inability of the therapeutic material to cross brain barriers from the systemic circulation into brain parenchymal tissues. In this review, we describe the anatomical structure of brain barriers with a focus on the major contributor to the brain's strict permeability. We review excerpts of CNS drug delivery approaches available for clinical use or still undergoing clinical or preclinical trials. We also highlight the principles underlying their mechanism of action and bring out some of their advantages and limitations. Finally, we attempt to follow their progress as they weave their way from preclinical investigation to clinical use.\n\nTargeted drug delivery has found applications in the diagnosis and treatment of many diseases, such as cancer [1], diabetes [2] and neurodegenerative diseases [3]. As yet, neurodegenerative diseases remain an area where targeted drug delivery is most needed, since surgical treatments are not always an option and a treatment at a molecular level is needed. Additionally, intravenously injected neurotherapeutic materials not only have to evade en route biological barriers, such as solubility in the solubility in the blood stream, stability against enzymatic degradation and phagocytosis, but also barriers interposed between the systemic circulation and brain tissues [4]. Barriers of the central nervous system (CNS) are made of specialized cells that lie at the interface between blood and nervous tissues, forming the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and between blood and cerebrospinal fluid, forming the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB) Figure 1 [5][6][7][8][9]. These specialized cells express transmembrane proteins with which they can seal off the intercellular space protecting brain tissues from micro-organisms, toxic",

            "text": "While we advance in resolving of these issues to identify promising targets and drugs, and to establish better stroke models (i.e., human organoids for drug screening), it is also a priority to progress the development of efficient systems for pharmacological administration into central nervous tissue, especially designed for humans. Non-invasive (systemic) and invasive (intracerebral) routes of administration have been preclinically and clinically explored. The main handicap of the systemic route is the inability of many drugs and biomolecules to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and reach the brain with efficacy [24]. The restrictive permeability of the BBB and, in particular, the abundance of tight junctions that encircle endothelial cells, complicates the entrance of biomolecules into the brain by crossing the luminal and antiluminal lipid membranes that face the blood lumen and the brain parenchyma, respectively. Under physiological conditions, several highly regulated mechanisms have been described to facilitate the passage of specific molecules through this barrier. These mechanisms include transporter proteins, transcytosis processes, simple diffusion, and paracellular transport in the tight junction borders between adjacent endothelial cells [25]. In general, the active mechanisms of transport permit the entrance of polar molecules, such as glucose and amino acids, while small hydrophobic substances generally cross the BBB by simple diffusion [26]. In addition, some large molecules can physiologically pass through transcytosis mechanisms. Under pathological conditions, the scenario is different, since the permeability of the BBB is impaired very early after injury [27]. For example, in ischemic rats, the permeability of the BBB is compromised as soon as 2-3 h after occlusion [28]. Despite the BBB being substantially impaired after injury, in most systemic applications, it is unknown how much of the administered drug may effectively reach the brain and whether the brain's local concentrations that are effective in rodent models are also valid for humans due to differences in drug clearance. All these facts obviate any control that we believe to have over drug kinetics at effective doses to target the salvage penumbra. An alternative route for systemic administration is intracerebral.",

            "text": "Nanocarriers, due to their small size and adaptability, have shown significant promise in drug delivery. Exosomes, as natural nanoparticles, have garnered attention for CNS disease treatment, owing to their potential for natural BBB crossing and versatile surface engineering. Banks and colleagues investigated the capacity of 10 exosome populations obtained from mouse, human, cancerous, and non-cancerous cell lines to traverse the bloodbrain barrier [41]. The study revealed that all tested exosomes successfully crossed the blood-brain barrier, exhibiting diverse rates and engaging in various vesicular-mediated mechanisms, including specific transporters, adsorptive transcytosis, and a brain-to-blood efflux system. [42] Recent research indicates that exosomes derived from different parent cells exhibit varying tropisms for organs and tissues [43]. For example, neural-stem-cellderived EVs demonstrated enhanced CNS distribution compared to mesenchymal-stemcell-derived EVs in a mouse stroke model [44]. Furthermore, under specific pathological conditions, such as brain inflammation or tumors, there is a notable enhancement in exosome transport across the blood-brain barrier [45,46]. In mice with brain inflammation, exosomes derived from macrophages demonstrated more than a three-fold increase in delivery to the brain compared to those in normal mice [47]. Studies have postulated two possibilities for the uptake of exosomes by the brain: either being sequestered inside the brain endothelial cells or undergoing complete passage through the endothelial cell barrier [41,45]. Julien Saint-Pol et al. propose several hypothetical pathways to elucidate the communication and interaction between exosomes and the target brain cells [48]. Through the utilization of uptake mechanisms, strategies have been employed to enhance the potential of exosomes to traverse the blood-brain barrier as follows. \n\nThe process of receptor-mediated transcytosis (RMT) involves the movement of invaginated endosomal compartments to the opposite side of the membrane and is initiated by the binding of a specific ligand to its corresponding receptor. RMT has been extensively studied and widely applied for transportation through the endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier [49].",

            "text": "Exosomes are a subset of EVs with a diameter ranging from 30 to 100 nm, and their composition includes lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids [126,127]. Their lipid content includes sphingomyelin, phosphatidylserine, cholesterol, and ceramide or derivatives. Exosomes also carry non-specific proteins (e.g., cytoplasmic enzymes, cytosolic proteins, heat shock proteins, and transferring proteins) and specific proteins that differ from one exosome to another, depending on their origin. The genetic material of these vesicles includes This specialized barrier acts as an interface with the capacity to regulate the entry of plasma components, red blood cells, and leukocytes into the CNS and ensures the export of potentially neurotoxic molecules from the brain to the blood [119,120]. This barrier strictly controls the molecule movements between the blood and the brain, regulating the homeostasis of the nervous system [119]. Moreover, more than 98% of all small-molecule drugs and approximately 100% of biological drugs are incapable of crossing the BBB. Additionally, water-soluble molecules in the blood are prevented from entering the CNS, while lipid-soluble molecules are reduced by enzymes or efflux pumps [115,121]. \n\nThe BBB possesses several permanently active transport mechanisms to ensure the transport of nutrients into the CNS while excluding blood-borne molecules that could be detrimental [122]. On one hand, these BBB properties are proof of its vital role in maintaining the specialized microenvironment of the brain tissue. On the other hand, these features make CNS access one of the most difficult of the body, limiting the development of novel effective drugs to treat AD [119]. Even though the BBB is a strict barrier for the circulation of molecules between the blood and the CNS, there are a few pathways that allow the delivery of essential molecules that maintain brain homeostasis (Figure 5B). These include the transcellular pathway, the paracellular pathway, efflux pumps, carrier-mediated transcytosis, receptor-mediated transcytosis, and adsorptive-mediated transcytosis [114].",

            "text": "SLM also acts on the CNS by suppressing neuroinflammation, attenuating brain damage, and ameliorating cognitive deficits in various models of neurological disorders [19][20][21]. Despite sharing the immense neurotherapeutic potential of SLM, its clinical applicability has been limited due to poor aqueous solubility (0.04 mg/mL) and oral bioavailability (23-47%) [22]. In addition, SLM suffers from first-pass metabolism. In the past two decades, the nanotechnology approach has been extensively used to increase the drugs' solubility and permeability. Furthermore, it was reported that nanotechnology has no effect on the inherent properties of medicinal compounds. The current study was designed to develop micro-SLM formulations in order to enhance the therapeutic potential of the drug. \n\nThe blood-brain barrier (BBB) continues to be the most difficult barrier to cross for brain medication bioavailability. Efflux transporters, like P-glycoprotein (P-gp), are found in the endothelial cells that make up the BBB. This means that many lipophilic compounds, like potential therapeutic agents, cannot pass through the BBB. Due to the critical importance of effective drug delivery to the brain, a variety of approaches have been evaluated to minimize the effects of the BBB, including the use of prodrugs, inhibiting efflux transporters, disrupting the endothelial tight junctions that, along with the cell membrane, form the physical barrier, and nasal administration. \n\nThe high permeability of nasal mucosa and broad surface area allows for a quick onset of the therapeutic effect of the drug. The low metabolic milieu of the snout has the ability to overcome the constraints of the oral route and emulate the advantages of intravenous administration. Furthermore, nasal administration reduces the lag time associated with oral drug delivery and has the fewest negative systemic effects. The ability to target the central nervous system without passing through the BBB is an intriguing advantage of nasal medication administration.",

            "text": "It may be possible to postpone or even reverse many brain illnesses and age-related declines in brain function [65]. \n\nWhen primary tumors or metastases develop in unhealthy circumstances, the BBB is physically and functionally impaired beyond 1-2 mm in diameter, during this stage it becomes the blood-brain tumor barrier (BBTB). The deficiency of fenestration, the tight connections between endothelial cells (ECs), and the lower incidence of pinocytosis all restrict molecular exchange across the BBB, limiting transcellular transit [66]. Curcumin's limited penetration through the BBB and its chemical-physical properties provide significant constraints for using these novel systems in brain diseases. The BBB between the blood and the central nervous system (CNS) has the physiological function of maintaining ionic homeostasis and chemical exchange, thereby shielding the CNS from infections and circulating toxins and sustaining the brain microenvironment [67]. The structure, function, and permeability of the BBB changed in brain cancers such as glioblastoma (GBM). Even though various methods for crossing the BBB have been developed, significant issues still make brain drug delivery problematic. The use of customized nanocarriers to preserve drugs while allowing them to pass across the BBB appears to be a successful approach [68]. \n\nThe first stage of endocytosis determines the ultimate passage of nanoparticles into endothelial cells via transcytosis. The endothelial cells' outer membrane influences the nanoparticles' entrance; in fact, positively charged nanoparticles employ the adsorbing transcytosis route more readily than neutral or negatively charged nanoparticles, which have more negligible protein adsorption and thus longer circulation durations. Because of improper tight junctions, nanoparticles can penetrate the BBB via receptor-mediated transcytosis (RMT), adsorptive-mediated transcytosis (AMT), and extended permeability and retention (EPR) [68]. \n\nEndothelial cells (ECs), pericytes, and astrocytes occupy the BBB, and their end feet cover the basal lamina of the brain capillaries.",

            "text": "A number of patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases and other central nervous system (CNS) disorders has shown a continuous increase that is associated with the aging population during the last decade. Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, migraine, malignant glioma, vestibular schwannoma, meningitis, and multiple sclerosis are representative CNS-related diseases [1]. However, effective therapeutic agents to treat most of these diseases are still missing, mainly due to the complicated, multifactorial pathogenic mechanisms [2]. Another major hurdle in the treatment of CNS diseases is the very limited accessibility of most potential active therapeutic compounds to the brain from the systemic circulation, which results in drug levels reaching the target site being insufficient to exert the pharmacological effect [3]. \n\nRestricted drug entry to the brain is closely associated with the existence of the blood brain barrier (BBB), the network of blood vessels that is comprised of tightly packed endothelial cells that separates the brain (central interstitial fluid) from the systemic circulation [4]. BBB has a selective permeability and it does not allow for the entry of harmful substances, such as toxins, bacteria, and chemicals. Only small lipophilic molecules can easily cross the BBB and almost all large molecular weight compounds (e.g., proteins) and over 98% of hydrophilic/low-molecular-weight drugs cannot cross the BBB, thereby suffering from the very low bioavailability in the brain [5]. \n\nNumerous attempts have been made to improve the drug delivery to the brain [6]. Strategies for facilitating drug transport across the BBB can be classified into invasive-and noninvasive ones. Invasive strategies include the chemical disruption of BBB by inducing temporarily shrinkage of endothelial cells, transient opening of tight junction, and allowing drug transport to the CNS [7,8]. Noninvasive strategies take advantage of the endogenous nutrient transport mechanisms that BBB has for the drugs penetrating the BBB [9][10][11], including transcytosis mediated by transporters expressed on the BBB.",

This review highlights the great potential of recent advances in cell therapy for the treatment of neurological disorders. Through the administration of pluripotent or stem cells, this novel therapy may promote neuroprotection, neuroplasticity, and neuroregeneration in lesion areas. The review also addresses the administration of these therapeutic molecules by the intranasal route, a promising, non-conventional route that allows for direct access to the central nervous system without crossing the blood\u2013brain barrier, avoiding potential adverse reactions and enabling the administration of large quantities of therapeutic molecules to the brain. Finally, we focus on the need to use biomaterials, which play an important role as nutrient carriers, scaffolds, and immune modulators in the administration of non-autologous cells. Little research has been conducted into the integration of biomaterials alongside intranasally administered cell therapy, a highly promising approach for the treatment of neurological disorders.",

            "text": "In order for a therapeutic agent to be effective, it needs to reach the site of pathology, i.e., the CNS, where the degeneration of neurons and neuroinflammation take place. The discovery of treatments for CNS disease has been challenged by the existence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which is a highly selective barrier that isolates the CNS from systemic circulation, protecting the brain from pathogens and maintaining CNS homeostasis to allow proper neuronal function. The BBB is mainly made up of brain capillary endothelial cells (BCECs), which are connected to each other by tight junctions (TJs) and adherens junctions (AJs). 57 Lacking fenestration, these BCECs are tightly packed, restricting the paracellular diffusion of hydrophilic small molecules. 58 The transport of necessary nutrients and certain drugs across the BBB is regulated by a series of specific transport mechanisms, which can generally be classified into the following categories: passive diffusion, carrier-mediated transport, and vesicular trafficking, such as receptor-mediated transcytosis and adsorptive-mediated transcytosis. 59 Small molecule drugs make up a large majority of available CNS therapeutics, most of which penetrate the BBB via passive diffusion, while only a small number penetrate via carrier-mediated mechanisms. 60 One of the challenges in designing BBB-crossing small molecules is to maintain molecules' high lipid solubility while enabling reasonable solubility in aqueous brain interstitial fluid to reach target cells. This property requirement screens out more than 98% of all US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved small molecule drugs to be used in the CNS. 59,60 Compared to small molecule therapeutics, biologic drugs, such as recombinant proteins, antibodies, or nucleic acid drugs, are larger in size and generally do not cross the BBB via passive diffusion. 61 Proper delivery vehicles needs to be tailored to carry biologic and small molecule drugs that cannot penetrate the BBB, facilitating their entry into the CNS via receptor-mediated transcytosis. 62",

Among these disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, are especially challenging to manage. Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by age-related decline in neurological functioning and often involve neuronal cell death [2]. This gradual decline results in debilitating long-term impacts on health and quality of life [1]. The etiology of neurodegenerative diseases has been related to several factors such as; mitochondrial dysfunction, the buildup of misfolded proteins, neuroinflammation, aging, oxidative harm, and sometimes inherited and molecular issues, which can either occur separately or combined, leading to disruption of neuronal communication and thus long-term cognitive and motor impairment [1,3,4]. \n\nBecause of our limited understanding of the complicated pathogenesis of neurological diseases, current therapies are only considered symptomatic treatment, and there are no diseasemodifying drugs that can stop the progression of these diseases. The main challenges for creating new drugs for neurological diseases include identifying the right target and designing and specifically delivering the drugs to that target to ensure effective control of symptoms and avoid failure of treatment [4,5]. \n\nBesides the challenge of formulating a drug delivery system targeting the Central Nervous System(CNS), various physiological factors such as the blood-brain barrier (BBB), bloodcerebrospinal fluid barriers, and drug efflux systems also limit the access of drugs to the CNS [6]. To ensure the highest possible bioavailability with minimal side effects, it is essential to conduct a comprehensive investigation into the BBB to develop a drug and carrier system that can effectively reach the CNS. \n\nDifferent brain delivery approaches have been reported in the literature, such as intracerebroventricular, and intra-cerebral delivery methods or transient disruption of the BBB in response to stimuli of different natures; physical, chemical, or biological.",

            "text": "Curing central nervous system diseases represents an important challenge for scientists. Pharmaceutical therapy remains the most reliable method for treatment of these diseases [1][2] . However, the limited ability of macromolecular drugs to cross the blood-spinal cord and blood-brain barriers constitutes one of the main problem in this area of medicine. Macromolecular drugs are excluded from the central nervous system by the presence of endothelial cell tight junctions at the blood-spinal cord and blood-brain barriers. Numerous studies have reported interesting approaches to identify a better way to enable drug delivery to the central nervous system through crossing the blood-spinal cord and blood-brain barriers [3][4][5][6][7][8] . Nanocarriers have been used to increase the stability of administered therapeutic molecules, improve their efficacy, and decrease undesired side effects [9] . Liposomes are well-investigated drug carriers. The plasma membrane presents a formidable barrier to the introduction of macromolecules into cells. Liposomes can diffuse through the endothelial cell membrane and enter the central nervous system passively. Nevertheless, some studies have demonstrated that naive liposomes cannot cross the blood-spinal cord barrier in large amounts to achieve a positive partition coefficient with the concentration administered [10][11] . Transactivating-transduction protein (TAT) is an 11 amino acid portion of the HIV-1 TAT protein that activates transcription of the viral genome [12] . Because traversal through cellular membranes represents a major barrier for efficient delivery of macromolecules into cells, the TAT protein may serve to transport various drugs. It has been widely shown [13][14] that addition of TAT and polyethylene glycol (PEG) to the surface of liposomes enhances their ability to be delivered across cellular membranes and also cross the blood-brain barrier. Few studies have focused on the mechanism by which TAT-PEG-modified liposomes cross the blood-spinal cord and blood-brain barriers. Fluorescence microscopy is among the most important tools to follow the specific interactions of targeted liposomes with cells and elucidate fine details of their intracellular fate [15] .\n\nTherefore, this study was designed to analyze the delivery of a novel liposome",

The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a primary physical and biological obstacle that allows only small molecules to pass through it. Its selective permeability is a significant challenge in delivering therapeutics into the brain for treating brain dysfunction. It is estimated that only 2% of the new central nervous system (CNS) therapeutic compounds can cross the BBB and achieve their therapeutic targets. Scientists are exploring various approaches to develop effective cargo delivery vehicles to promote better therapeutics targeting the brain with minimal off-target side effects. Despite different synthetic carriers, one of the natural brain cargo delivery systems, \u201cexosomes,\u201d are now employed to transport drugs through the BBB. Exosomes are naturally occurring small extracellular vesicles (EVs) with unique advantages as a therapeutic delivery system for treating brain disorders. They have beneficial innate aspects of biocompatibility, higher stability, ability to cross BBB, low cytotoxicity, low immunogenicity, homing potential, targeted delivery, and reducing off-site target effects. In this review, we will discuss the limitations of synthetic carriers and the utilization of naturally occurring exosomes as brain-targeted cargo delivery vehicles and highlight the methods for modifying exosome surfaces and drug loading into exosomes. We will also enlist neurodegenerative disorders targeted with genetically modified exosomes for their treatment.",

Another is to use implantable systems, such as osmotic pumps or enhanced convention devices, for continuous drug infusion. However, surgical approaches are invasive, risky, and cannot be used when the implantable device crosses or targets critical areas of the brain. It is also possible to use such devices to perform intraventricular or intrathecal administration of drugs when involving the cerebrospinal fluid-brain barrier to avoid the blood-brain barrier. Intranasal delivery is also an emerging noninvasive alternative to bypass the blood-brain barrier and facilitates delivery of large charged therapeutic molecules into the brain. 7 Rather than bypassing the blood-brain barrier, it is possible to disrupt it temporarily by opening the tight junctions of endothelial cells. Under these conditions, permeability of the blood vessels in the brain to systemically applied treatments can be increased. 8 A transient disruption of the blood-brain barrier may be achieved by: osmotic shock using mannitol, arabinose, or other hypertonic solutions; acting at specific receptors on endothelial cells with substrates that affect the tight junctions, such as bradykinin receptors; 9 and using magnetic resonance imaging-guided ultrasound in combination with microbubbles of contrast agents to induce focalized openings in small areas of the brain. 10 Opening of the blood-brain barrier may be a dangerous procedure because it can cause hydroelectrolytic changes and suppress the mechanisms that regulate the entrance of substances into the brain. 11 There are alternative methods for distributing drugs inside the brain parenchyma without altering the blood-brain barrier when the aforementioned transport mechanisms are not suitable or unavailable. The first option is to use chemical derivatives or to partially modify the structure of the drug to facilitate traversing of the blood-brain barrier while maintaining drug activity (eg, by adding aliphatic chains to increase lipophilicity). 13 A second possibility is to use prodrugs, ie, reversible compounds that in their native state are not biologically active, but are able to cross the blood-brain barrier and undergo an enzymatic or chemical transformation once in the brain",

            "text": "The blood-brain barrier is a highly selective semi-permeable border of endothelial cells that prevents solutes in the circulating blood from crossing non-selectively into the extracellular fluid of the central nervous system, where neurons reside [35]. In the brain, there are two main associated fluid compartments: the extracellular fluid, which surrounds neurons and glial cells, and the cerebrospinal fluid, which is located in the subarachnoid space and ventricles of the brain [36]. The passage of Mg through this barrier is made possible by a complex system of genes and proteins [1]. \n\nAnimal studies have shown that Mg can cross the blood-brain barrier and is transported across the barrier with a net flow from the blood to the parenchyma [37][38][39]. The active transport of Mg from the blood to the extracellular fluid of the brain is evidenced by its higher concentration in the extracellular cortical fluid than in the plasma dialysate or cisternal cerebrospinal fluid [38,39]. Another interesting finding is that Mg administration could atten-uate cell death secondary to alterations in the cytoskeleton and, therefore, reduce apoptosis due to p53 expression after brain trauma [1]. \n\nConcerning the association between Mg and brain edema, it has been proposed that Mg supplementation decreases regional brain tissue water content, attenuates brain edema formation after trauma, protects the blood spinal cord blood, improves clinical recovery, and preserves normal spinal cord ultrastructure in the case of experimental spinal cord injury in rats [1,[40][41][42]. This has been demonstrated in experimental studies focused on the treatment of cerebral edema that sought to demonstrate the benefits of Mg administered in combination with various pharmacological drugs in animal models and its possible role in the resolution of cerebral edema [43]. They revealed that increased aquaporin-4 (AQP-4), which is a bidirectional transmembrane water channel believed to play a role in brain injury by contributing to increased brain water content, could result in cerebral edema [40,41].",

            "text": "The brain can be damaged by a wide range of conditions including infections, hypoxia, poisoning, stroke, chronic degenerative disease and acute trauma. Some of the most problematic forms of brain damage are those associated with chronic neurodegenerative diseases or acute brain trauma as a result of contusive or penetrating injury. In these cases, damage results in the loss of specific populations of neurons and the development of defined psychiatric or neurological symptoms. Current treatments for these problems are designed to pharmacologically modify disease symptoms; however, no therapies are yet available that fully restores lost function or slow ongoing neurodegeneration in the brain. Many promising therapies with growth factors has been implicated in brain regeneration, repair and neuroprotection in the central nervous system produced interesting results, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (Spuch et al. 2010) brain derived growth factor (BDNF) (Malik et al., 2010) or nerve growth factor (NGF) (Sharma. 2010). However, the critical problem is the way to deliver, in a continuous and localized manner, and more important is to supply physiological amounts of growth factors into focus damage of the brain tissue. One interesting approach is cell encapsulation, in which engineered somatic cells are protected against immune cell mediated and antibody-mediated rejection through immobilization in a polymer matrix surrounded by a semipermeable membrane. The latter regulates the bidirectional diffusion of nutrients, allowing the controlled and continuous delivery of therapeutic proteins in the absent of immunosupression in the proper concentration and localization. Encapsulated cells offer enormous potential for the treatment of human disease. Many attempts have been made to prevent the rejection of transplanted cells by the immune system. Cell encapsulation is promising machinery for cell transplantation and new materials and approaches were developed to encapsulate various types of cells to treat a wide range of diseases. Cell microencapsulation holds promise for the treatment of many diseases by the continuous delivery of therapeutic products. The complexity of many neurological diseases needs the developing of new drugs and especially new pathways to deliver the drug at proper concentration and into the correct localization.

            "text": "The approval rate for drugs to treat central nervous system (CNS) disorders is significantly lower than that for other therapeutic classes. 1 Despite aggressive efforts, many new compounds targeting the CNS are not effective in delivering a safe and efficacious dose to the brain. 1,2 One challenging aspect of CNS drug development is the requirement of the compound to cross the blood\u2212brain barrier (BBB) in sufficient amounts for therapeutic response. The BBB consists of a continuous layer of endothelial cells, surrounded by astrocyte footprocesses, and scattered pericytes. An intact BBB presents a formidable obstacle for the entry of drugs into the brain. The brain microvessel endothelial cells that form the BBB have complex tight junctions, low endocytic activity, and an absence of fenestrations 3 that prevent the passage of most polar and hydrophilic solutes from the blood into the brain. \u221210 Numerous approaches have been examined to enhance drug delivery to the brain. One such method is to chemically modify the drug molecules to reduce their interactions with efflux transporter proteins and, thus, enhance their permeation through the transcellular route. 11 This method had been tested with some chemotherapeutic drugs including paclitaxel. While chemical modification of functional groups has proven beneficial in improving BBB permeability through limiting drug interaction with efflux transporters, 12,13 there are clearly structural limitations to this approach. Another strategy to enhance drug delivery to the brain involves the direct bypassing of the BBB altogether. Two common techniques that utilize this approach include intraventricular infusion of the drug and intracerebral implants containing drug. These techniques have great potential in delivering a high dose of drug locally into the brain without causing systemic side effects; however, when used in clinical settings, the results to date have been disappointing. This may be due to the relatively small surface area of the brain that is in contact with the ventricular compartment and the limited diffusion of the drugs into the brain parenchyma from the infusion site in humans compared to preclinical animal models. 14",

The primary contact between the blood and the brain is established by the endothelial cells of the cerebral capillaries, which constitute this barrier. The BBB is the most significant impediment to the development of novel CNS therapeutics and biologics. Pharmaceuticals, including most tiny compounds, do not typically enter or exit the BBB (Cavalu et al., 2020a). Numerous efforts have been made over the last decade to address this critical issue by devising various techniques to facilitate medication transport over the BBB. In recent years, nanotechnology-based approaches have grown in prominence due to their ability to circumvent the restrictions imposed by BBB crossing. Controlled medication delivery and release for a variety of CNS diseases may be achieved using a variety of lipidic, polymeric, inorganic, and other kinds of nanoparticles (NPs) (Cavalu et al., 2020b). \n\nAs a result, NP-based treatments for AD have mostly focused on preventing A\u03b2 from aggregating or sequestering the peptide in order to reduce its brain level (the so-called \"sink effect\") (Matsuoka et al., 2003). Sink-effect-capable nanoliposomes (NL) with phosphatidic acid or cardiolipin were developed by Gobbi et al. (2010). Studying these NL in vitro, researchers found that they were highly sensitive to A\u03b2 and had its protective effect (Bereczki et al., 2011). The findings of Mourtas et al. (2011) and Canovi et al. (2011) show that NL coated with an anti-A monoclonal antibody, which has strong affinity for A\u03b2 either in vitro or ex vivo on post-mortem AD brain tissues, may suppress A\u03b2 aggregation in vitro and in vivo (Taylor et al., 2011). The capacity of fullerenes C60 to prevent A\u03b2 fibrillization is being studied in a similar fashion (Podolski et al., 2007).",

The presence of barriers, such as the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier are a major obstacle to delivering drugs to the brain (only small molecules can cross these barriers), reducing the efficacy of various therapies. Recently, it has been identified that membrane-bound vesicles of brain endothelial cells influence the formation of nanotubes involved in the construction of the BBB (Mentor and Fisher, 2021). In addition to crossing the BBB is necessary to target specific cell types such as neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia involved in specific brain diseases. Several DDSs, including nanoparticles, extracellular vesicles, and artificial vesicles have been studied for brain drug delivery (Dong 2018;Nuzzo et al., 2021). Vesicles derived from cells and brain tissue have been fabricated recently as DDS. In this review, we analyzed these new systems and their potential as DDS to contrast the brain disorders.",

            "text": "The shield of the blood brain barrier (BBB) to protect the brain makes it arduous to deliver drugs to the brain. It has been difficult  for drug delivery systems to cross the BBB and ingress into the neural region despite considerable advancement in the field. This makes the treatment of brain diseases very challenging and the success rate with regards to encephalopathy stands very low (Li et al., 2021). RBC membrane cloaking will make it trouble-free for any molecule or nanoparticle to have their way across the BBB as their membrane properties possess the privilege of passing through all the systems of the body. \n\nCurcumin, a multitarget drug, wielded its neuroprotective effects by activating several neurotrophic factors in the brain through various mechanisms. But due to its low water solubility, it has poor bioavailability. The use of curcumin in Alzheimer's disease to make use of its protective effects was achieved by RBCcloaked nanoparticles. PLGA nanoparticles loaded with curcumin was cloaked with RBC membrane and functionalized with DSPE-PEG-T807 with a size of 170 nm which could target at neuronal tau. The RBC protects curcumin by increasing its bioavailability while the T807 helps crossing the BBB with good biocompatibility, and sustained curcumin release (Figure 8B) and prolonged circulation (Figure 10) (Gao et al., 2020a). Another study has been designed with the same nanoparticle for Alzheimer's disease except that human serum albumin was used as a carrier in place of PLGA with a particle size less than 120 nm (Gao et al., 2020b). Both studies have shown good uptakes of the nanoparticles with desired targeting for the treatment of Alzheimer's. Immunotherapeutic effect in glioblastoma therapy was also achieved by using RBC-cloaked nanogels with a size about 131 nm carrying miRNAs. Reinforcement of microglia and macrophages by miRNAs reprograms the immunotherapeutic impact.",

These barriers serve as the brain's biochemical and physiological defense mechanisms (Sharma et al., 2012). The presence of the BBB, along with enzyme interactions and restricted entry of pharmaceutical agents, renders various treatments ineffective (Whiting, 2013). For effective therapy of neuronal disorders, drugs must be highly lipophilic and have a molecular weight ranging from 400 to 600 Da (Wong et al., 2012). Moreover, nanoparticles, in combination with pharmaceutical active ingredients, offer an efficient brain targeting approach for multiple therapies (Alam et al., 2010). Crossing the BBB remains a major challenge in drug delivery. Hydrophilic drugs are transported through specific carrier-mediated endocytosis and the paracellular route, while lipid-soluble drugs are transported via diffusion and P-glycoprotein (Jyoti et al., 2018). Nanogels, known for their non-toxic nature, high drug loading efficiency, and improved BBB permeability, present a promising option (Leonard and G\u00e9rard, 2010).

Moreover, the BBB performs a vital function in protecting the brain from pathogens and other dangerous agents in the blood circulation. Despite its crucial role, this barrier represents a difficult obstacle for the treatment of brain diseases because many therapeutic agents cannot cross it. Thus, different strategies based on nanoparticles have been explored in recent years. Concerning this, chitosan-decorated nanoparticles have demonstrated enormous potential for drug delivery across the BBB and treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease, gliomas, cerebral ischemia, and schizophrenia. Our main objective was to highlight the high potential of chitosan adsorption to improve the penetrability through the BBB of nanoformulations for diseases of CNS. Therefore, we describe the BBB structure and function, as well as the routes of chitosan for crossing it. Moreover, we define the methods of decoration of nanoparticles with chitosan and provide numerous examples of their potential utilization in a variety of brain diseases. Lastly, we discuss future directions, mentioning the need for extensive characterization of proposed nanoformulations and clinical trials for evaluation of their efficacy.",

            "text": "The delivery of many potentially therapeutic and diagnostic compounds to specific areas of the brain is restricted by the blood-brain barrier, the blood-CSF barrier, or other specialised central nervous system (CNS) barriers. These brain barriers are now recognised as a major obstacle to the treatment of most brain disorders. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is constituted by the endothelial cells of the brain capillaries. These cells are linked by tight junctions that form an effective barrier to paracellular aqueous diffusion (Brightman & Reese, 1969;Kniesel & Wolburg, 2000). Such junctions do not exist in the capillary endothelial cells of the peripheral circulation. This difference is thought to be the result of close apposition to both astrocytes and pericytes, both of which are tightly applied to the basement membrane of the cerebral capillaries (Kacem et al., 1998). Astrocytes have end feet, which spread in a network around the capillaries. The BBB also forms an electrical barrier in the form of a transendothelial electrical resistance (Begley & Brightman, 2003).\n\nIt can be readily seen, therefore, that the BBB effectively prevents most polar bloodborne solutes from crossing. Yet monocytes cross the BBB and differentiate into microglia. Migration is significantly inhibited by the addition of blocking antibodies to intercellular adhesion molecule-1, very late antigen-4 integrin, and monocyte chemoattractant protein (CCL-2/MCP-1), or treatment with tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (Seguin et al., 2003). These results support the concept that monocyte-endothelial cell interactions are somehow responsible for monocyte migration across the BBB.",

            "text": "The human brain is the primary center for our cognitive activities and is commonly recognized as the most complex organ of the human body. Due to its important role in human survival, the brain is guarded by a boney skull (elastic modulus, 2.4 \u00b1 1.5 GPa) [1] and a robust blood-brain barrier (BBB) (Transendothelial Electrical Resistance (TEER), ~5000 \u2126 cm 2 ) [2]. While excellent for protecting the brain, these natural barriers have also made it difficult to study and treat brain disorders, in particular, diseases that require rapid treatment. More specifically, not much is known about up-or downregulation of angiogenesis, that is, the formation of new blood capillaries via vascular sprouting from the preexisting vasculature. Most drugs that are used for treating extracranial angiogenesis (pro-/anti-angiogenic)-related conditions are ineffective intracranially. Timely delivery of the therapeutic molecules across the BBB in an angiogenesis-related condition is therefore needed. \n\nNumerous nanomedicines (NMs) have been investigated to treat angiogenesis-related conditions all over the body, and various endothelium-targeting nanosystems have been reported [3]. Recently, NMs have been investigated for their efficacy in treating brain angiogenesis conditions. These have included nano-capsules, such as solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) [4][5][6][7][8], liposomes [9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16], exosomes [17], and others [18], as well as nano-scaffolds made of chitosan [19], polymers [20,21], inorganic nanoparticles (NPs) [22][23][24], etc. (see Table 1). Only a few are FDA approved-namely, lomustine-liposomes and carboplatin-liposomes-and the survival benefits are very limited [25].",

            "text": "The global increase in aging population has also increased the incidence of neurodegenerative diseases. 1 Major neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), are diagnosed by detection of abnormal protein aggregates such as beta amyloid (A\u03b2) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) for AD, and alphasynuclein (\u03b1-syn) for PD. 2 To target these proteins, clinical trials that involve the assessment of investigational drugs (chemical or protein) or cell therapies have been conducted. 3,4 e of the major challenges in delivering therapeutics to the brain is the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The BBB protects the brain from harmful toxins but also functions as a barricade in the crossing of molecules, proteins, and cells into the brain parenchyma. To date, drug delivery research has focused on changing the physico-chemical attributes of the therapeutics or implementing additional methods (e.g., application of ultrasound to the cerebrovascular system) to increase the permeability of the BBB. 5-8  Moreover, because therapeutic efficacy may vary depending on the surrounding microenvironment of the administered site, accurate administration to the lesion site is of utmost importance. \n\n In previous studies, we found that MSCs administered via blood vessels (intravenous, 14 intra-arterial 15 ) were not detected in the brain, presumably due to the BBB. Unlike administration via the bloodstream, direct injection causes injury to the brain. 16 The intracranial approach, however, holds great therapeutic potential due to the accuracy in delivering drugs. 17 Intracranial administration includes delivery via the intracerebroventricular (ICV) or parenchymal route. While precise and accurate delivery to the lesion site may be difficult, the administered drug may be distributed widely throughout the brain when delivered via the ICV route. The washout of the therapeutics via cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow may reduce the overall therapeutic effects. 18",

            "text": "The average human brain is composed of 86 billion neurons and 85 billion glia-indispensable cells that require a special protective environment to ensure proper brain function. 1 This protection is guaranteed by a 650-km (400-mile) network of specialized blood vasculature designed to selectively restrict the entry of potentially toxic substances into the brain. 2 This blood-brain barrier (BBB) is fundamental in maintaining homeostasis and physiological brain function, with BBB disruption being a hallmark of most major neurological disorders. 3 nfortunately, the BBB is, at the same time, a barrier for most systemically applied drugs. An intact BBB is impermeable for 98% of all small molecule drugs and for nearly all large substances, such as peptides, antibodies or gene-and cell-based therapeutics. 4 herefore, many research laboratories are developing diverse strategies to improve therapeutic drug delivery to the brain, ranging from targeted ultrasound and alteration of administration routes to biochemical or genetic modifications. For instance, various drug delivery systems have been tested to transport small molecules across the BBB based on nanoparticles, such as liposomes or cyclodextrins. For larger molecules, such as antibodies, the brain shuttle technology has been recently developed and is currently being clinically tested for Alzheimer's disease to enable efficient crossing of the BBB by binding the transferrin receptor. 5 By contrast, the delivery of cells to the brain has been considerably less explored, even though cell therapy holds great promise to restore damaged neural networks and become a promising regenerative strategy for acute neurological injuries, such as stroke. In total, more than 80 clinical trials in the field of cell therapy for stroke have already been conducted or are currently ongoing. Although the initial clinical results have demonstrated the safety of cell therapies, further validating their translational potential, promising results from preclinical animal research have not been confirmed beyond doubt in a clinical setting. \n\nThe reasons for this limited translational success are multifaceted. For example, it is poorly understood which is the most promising cell source for transplantation.",

There are six FDA approved drugs (e.g., donepezil, memantine) that show some effectiveness; however, they only relieve symptoms. Two factors hamper research. First, the cause of Alzheimer\u2019s disease is not fully understood. Second, the blood-brain barrier restricts drug efficacy. This review summarized current knowledge relevant to both of these factors. First, we reviewed the pathophysiology of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Next, we reviewed the structural and biological properties of the blood-brain barrier. We then described the most promising drug delivery systems that have been developed in recent years; these include polymeric nanoparticles, liposomes, metallic nanoparticles and cyclodextrins. Overall, we aim to provide ideas and clues to design effective drug delivery systems for penetrating the blood-brain barrier to treat Alzheimer\u2019s disease.",

            "text": "SCFAs, particularly acetate, can cross the blood-brain barrier, where they exert neuroprotective effects by acting as an energy source for neurons and modulating neuroinflammation [143]. This connection between the gut and the brain, commonly referred to as the gut-brain axis, suggests that Bifidobacterium may have broader implications for cognitive and neurological development in infants [143]. \n\nThe co-evolution of bifidobacteria and human milk highlights the importance of understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie this symbiotic relationship. Systems biology approaches, such as metabolomics and next-generation sequencing, are poised to shed light on the interactions between HMOs, the infant microbiome, and host health [106]. These insights could inform the development of novel nutritional interventions, including probiotics and prebiotics, that mimic the beneficial effects of HMOs in formula-fed infants or those with disrupted microbiota. \n\nIn addition to understanding the molecular linkages between bifidobacteria and nutrition, researchers are exploring innovative methods to enhance the delivery, the efficacy, and stability of probiotics like B. infantis. One promising approach is bacterial encapsulation, which involves coating probiotic bacteria with protective materials to shield them from harsh GI conditions, such as stomach acid and bile salts [170]. Encapsulation improves the viability of probiotics during transit through the digestive system, increasing the likelihood that they will reach the colon in sufficient numbers to exert their beneficial effects. Encapsulated probiotics also offer the advantage of controlled release, where the bacteria are released gradually over time in the gut, maximizing their therapeutic potential. \n\nRecent advances in encapsulation technology have focused on optimizing the materials used to coat probiotics, as well as refining the size and release properties of the capsules. For example, microcapsules made from alginate or chitosan can provide targeted delivery to specific regions of the GI tract, while sub-100 \u00b5m microcapsules are being developed to improve sensory properties and increase the efficiency of probiotic delivery [171].",

            "text": "The delivery of drugs which can reach the CNS in sufficient concentrations is still a significant challenge in the treatment of CNS diseases [140]. One of the most selective barriers surrounding the CNS is the BBB formed by endothelial cells with tight junctions (TJ) and adherence junctions (AJ). The BBB does not only exclude large molecules; the FcRn expressed in the BBB and the blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier also contributes to the fast elimination of full-length IgGs from the brain [141]. Excluding immunological proteins, such as antibodies, from the brain is an important function of the BBB, preventing proinflammatory signs, e.g., swelling. Since the brain is surrounded by bony structures, swelling can lead to severe tissue damage. Therefore, the CNS is also referred to as an immune-privileged zone. Hence, smaller proteins, such as nanobodies and antibody derivatives without an Fc domain, should have a better potential for neurological and psychiatric indications [142]. \n\nSeveral drug delivery strategies have been introduced to cross the BBB: a paracellular route or passive diffusion by disruption of the BBB, a transcellular route by enhancing transcytosis using molecular BBB shuttles or direct delivery bypassing the BBB with intrathecal, intraventricular or intranasal delivery [143][144][145]. While nanobodies have been often discussed in relation to crossing the BBB, the number of experimental validations is rather low. However, the results of one study indicated that, following intravenous injection, two VHHs targeting extracellular amyloid deposits and intracellular tau neurofibrils bypassed the BBB in transgenic mouse models [142]. This is a promising achievement which could make the early-stage diagnosis of brain-related diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, possible. Furthermore, a VHH fusion protein with green fluorescent protein was designed to target glial fibrillary acidic protein, a protein expressed on astrocytes. This VHH was able to cross the BBB in vivo and reached the astrocytes after intracarotid and intravenous injections [146]. The authors discussed the possibility that the basic isoelectric point of a VHH could play a role.",

            "text": "Biodegradable polymeric microspheres have been one of the most common types in LAM formulation due to the capability of customizing drug release at a controlled rate for a targeted period by regulating the polymer degradation [17,19]. Among the biodegradable polymers for LAM, poly(DL-lactideco-glycolide) (PLGA) is a popular choice as a rate-controlling agent due to the abundant molecular pool of commercial availability and degraded to glycolic acid and lactic acid monomers. PLGA enable an extensive fine-tuning of drug release by various combinations of physicochemical properties such as molecular weight, lactide/glycolide ratio, and terminal groups [20][21][22]. \n\nRecent studies have reported the direct channels between the skull bone marrow and the meninges that allow the trafficking of immune cells and direct access of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to bone marrow niches [23][24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32]. In an effort to explore these direct channels for brain drug delivery, we previously established intracalvariosseous administration (ICO), the direct drug application into the diploic space between the outer and inner cortex of the skull bone [33]. The previous results demonstrated that ICO could enhance brain exposure level of small molecular CNS drugs several tens to a hundred times compared to IV injection in a day-long study with mice. In a month-long study with rabbits and infusion pump implants (under review), we also demonstrated that ICO readily delivers various molecules, including small molecular compounds, macromolecular nucleic acids and large colloidal nanoparticles to the brain. Together, we can conclude that the inner cortex of the skull is permeable to various sized molecules and ICO serves as a new blood-brain barrier (BBB)-bypassing route for brain drug delivery, particularly for drugs facing challenges in crossing the BBB [33]. \n\nHere, we report that intracalvariosseous administration of donepezil-loaded long-acting microspheres protects against cognitive impairment through long-lasting brain exposure in mice (Figure 1).",

            "text": "Transcytosis holds a great potential for drug delivery across different endothelial barriers. Designing efficient 'vectors' (antibodies, protein carriers, viruses, nanoparticles) to deliver therapeutics, especially to the disease-affected brain tissue, in a controlled and non-invasive manner remains one of the key goals of drug development [1]. Careful regulation of material exchange into and out of the brain is essential for the survival of neurons, which do not have a significant capacity to regenerate. This transport is regulated by the blood-brain barrier (BBB), a dynamic interface between the blood and the brain formed by endothelial cells of the brain capillaries. However, it also very efficiently prevents the brain uptake of most therapeutically active compounds. Because of this, many diseases of central nervous system (CNS), such as Alzheimer's disease, are undertreated. As a result, various strategies have been developed to improve the access of drugs to the brain parenchyma at therapeutically necessary concentrations to effectively manage diseases [2,3]. Various drug delivery systems such as: liposomes, surfactant coated polymeric nanoparticles, solid lipid nanoparticles [4], microspheres, nanogels, and bionanocapsules were tested for delivery of drugs to tumors of the CNS with different efficiancies [5][6][7][8]. Even though transcytosis is often thought to be a selective process, endothelial cells of microvasculature move macromolecular cargo rather nonselectively within the fluid phase of the transport vesicle or by absorption to the vesicle membrane [9]. Using vectors promoting transcytosis in such nonspecific manner can be more widely applied, especially in combination with nanoparticles or liposomes, into which large amounts of a drug can be incorporated [10]. Liposomes seem to be a promising delivery system, which enable high cellular uptake and efficient transcytosis across cellular barriers including the BBB, as their composition can be easily adjusted according to the properties of targeted cells and tissues [11]. It is expected that by a proper choice of liposome composition an efficient transcytosis of liposome entrapped drugs across",

Among these properties, the unique property of MSC-Exo to cross the blood-brain barrier and migrate to the brain lesion area provides the possibility for direct treatment of neurological diseases or drug delivery. Regarding the specific mechanism of crossing, existing studies suggest that it may be the brain microvascular endothelial cells (ECs) that internalize and transport Exo across the BBB through endocytosis, only a small portion of exosomes (Exo) cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) through the paracellular pathway [93](Fig. 3). Although Exo can be uniformly taken up by the brain, the uptake mechanisms of Exo from different sources are diverse and often nonlinear, possibly related to brain-to-blood efflux [94]. Additionally, the complex components in MSC-Exo, such as various proteins, cytokines, and genetic materials, synergistically function through different targeting pathways, which are more efficient compared to single mechanisms [85]. \n\nAs a treatment tool for clinical precision medicine, the tissue distribution and targeting mechanisms of MSC-Exo are also one of the research focuses. Currently, brain drug delivery methods include intravenous injection, oral administration, stereotactic injection, nasal administration, etc. Different delivery methods have their own advantages and disadvantages in the treatment of brain diseases and also present specific tissue distribution patterns. Most studies use intravenous injection and find that MSC-Exo accumulate most in the heart, liver and spleen [93,95]. The non-invasive method of intranasal administration allows Exo to bypass the BBB more specifically and effectively deliver to the brain and accumulate in the damaged brain area [96,97]. However, there are currently no studies directly comparing their biological distribution and efficiency through different administration methods in the same model.",

            "text": "NPs must overcome various physiological barriers to reach their targets and effectively release the drugs they convey. The frequently discussed physical barriers to NPs distribution are the tight junctions among endothelial cells (ECs) and between ECs and epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract, as well as microglial cells and pericytes of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) (following oral and intravenous administration, respectively) (Fig. 3). To penetrate the central nervous system (CNS), NPs need to be taken up by BBB ECs via receptor-mediated endocytosis and exocytosed on the opposite side [106,120]. \n\nReceptor-mediated transcytosis is an efficient method of delivering drugs into the brain or infiltrating tumor tissues [121,122]. The transporter's variability on the plasma membranes of ECs complicates BBB's crossing. However, specific transporters, such as glucose transporters, are persistently overexpressed at the BBB. Certain common targets, such as the vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM), can enhance NPs trafficking through the BBB [123]. These transporters and VCAM have the potential to be used to deliver NPs into the brain. Other investigated targeting options, such as the transferrin receptor, have theoretical benefits over different transporter types but have yet to prove their clinical usefulness [124]. However, only 5% of a systemically delivered NPs dosage reaches the CNS, and of that even less than 5% reaches the targeted cells [125]. Recent research on AuNPs that crossed the BBB proved that the NPs corona composition had been changed after the crossing but had remained stable. Hence, understanding the corona-altering mechanisms might help develop future CNS targeting approaches. The BBB is the main barrier to systemically administered NPs penetrating CNS tissues. Overall, to reach the brain, the intranasal administration of NPs is becoming more and more popular, as it bypasses the BBB and eliminates many of the drawbacks of systemic administration [126].",

            "text": "Oral administration, the most desirable route of medicine delivery, requires a drug to be absorbed while in the GI tract, with cell membrane permeation being the major determinant of absorption. \n\nThere are several processes involved in crossing the intestinal mucosa, including active transport [15], paracellular transport, and drug efflux. Passive membrane diffusion is considered to be the major contributing process [25]. Recent analyses continue to demonstrate the significance of the non-specific permeation mechanisms governed by molecular properties (namely molecular size and polarity) [16]. \n\nThe favorable property space for an orally administered drugs is defined by the afore mentioned Ro5 [26,27]. In order to achieve absorption, an oral drug needs to have a cLogP < 5; MW < 500; hydrogen bond donor (HBD) count (NH+OH) < 5; and a hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) count (N+O) < 10. \n\nMore specific rules were developed for central nervous system (CNS) projects, where crossing the blood-brain barrier is challenging due to tighter junctions and higher efflux. The CNS MPO score introduced by Wager et al. [12] was derived by analysis of drugs and candidates with regard to their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. The CNS MPO includes ionization constant (pKa), log P, and log D 7.4 . This emphasizes the importance of ionization and lipophilicity adjusted for ionization [13,23,28,29]. Recently Z. Rankovi\u0107 further refined the CNS desirability criteria in CNS MPOv.2 [30]. \n\nLipophilicity measurements also help to estimate solubility in discovery settings [31]; solubility decreases with log P > 3.",

            "text": "Though the discovery of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) can be traced back to more than 100 years ago, it was not until the 1960s when electron microscopes became available in medical research that the role of endothelial cells in the BBB was determined and confirmed. 1 Compared to \"ordinary\" endothelial cells that line blood vessels in the rest of the body, endothelial cells in the brain microvessels exhibit highly extensive tight junctions and, thus, much lower endocytosis or transcytosis activities than peripheral endothelial cells. Tight junctions and adherent junctions are the interconnectors of cerebral endothelial cells. 2,3 The presence of these tight barriers on the apical side of cell membranes restricts most water-soluble molecules from crossing the BBB by paracellular aqueous pathways. In addition, on the surface of the endothelial cell membrane, only a few small lipid-soluble agents, such as ethanol, which are smaller than 400 Da and/or are less than eight pairs of hydrogen bonds, and gaseous molecules (such as oxygen and carbon dioxide) can passively diffuse across this regulated interference by transcellular lipophilic pathways. 4 Other compounds, including nutrients, are transported by specific transport systems on the membranes. \n\nDue to these highly selective tight cell-cell barriers, more than 98% of hydrophilic agents, including polar drugs, are blocked by the tight junctions. 6][7] As a result, developing more efficient drug delivery strategies to the CNS remains a concern for current researchers, and one of the promising approaches to deliver pharmaceutical agents to the brain is to use multifunctional magnetic nanoparticles. \n\nBased on evidence showing that small nanoparticles may rapidly cross the BBB, strategies have been developed for designing magnetic nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems to enhance the therapeutic level of drugs to reach the CNS parenchyma and to reduce nanoparticle toxicity in several fields such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging. [10][11] Superparamagnetism is a phenomenon that happens when SPIONs are under an external magnetic field. After the magnetic field is removed, they no longer exhibit any residual magnetic interactions.",

            "text": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) maintains homeostasis in the brain by selective transport of metabolic compounds, while excluding harmful compounds from the blood circulation. These barrier properties prevent adequate BBB crossing of many high potential ''would-be'' central nervous system (CNS) drugs. Most hydrophilic molecules are not able to cross the BBB due to the presence of tight junctions between the brain endothelial cells preventing paracellular transport. Transport of other more lipophilic small molecules that could potentially cross the barrier is often limited because they are substrate for efflux transporters like the p-glycoprotein (Pgp), multidrug related protein (MRP) or breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) transporters [1][2][3]. Many strategies to enhance the BBB transport of drugs have therefore been investigated. These strategies are either focused on locally circumventing the BBB by direct injections in the brain or through the blood stream for widespread delivery [4][5][6][7].\n\nFor the blood-to-brain delivery of drugs via the blood stream, advanced drug delivery systems like nanocarriers can best be used. Some examples of commonly used nanocarriers are liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles, albumin nanoparticles and polymeric nanoparticles [8]. Drug delivery using nanocarriers may increase the bioavailability and stability of drugs and decrease the (peripheral) toxicity. Furthermore, drugs delivered by liposomes are described to be able to bypass the efflux transporters at the BBB [9,10]. Moreover, liposomal formulation allows a wide range of compounds, like small molecules, peptides, proteins and RNA to be encapsulated without changing their function and protecting them against degradation and potential immune responses. Coating of liposomes with polyethylene glycol (PEG) further ensures a prolonged circulation time in plasma allowing prolonged dosing intervals. As a result, liposomes have been used in clinical practice for several years and are shown to be effective and safe for human use (e.g. Doxil \u00d5 , Ambisome \u00d5 ). Liposomes can furthermore be functionalized with ligands to target specific cell types",

            "text": "Infections of the brain are often very difficult to treat because of the difficulty of most antimicrobial agents to cross the blood brain barrier and inhibit microbial agents [84]. This is due to the fact that the brain is made up of complex cell networks that filter foreign materials, protect and prevent the brain from injuries and diseases [83]. However, some small microbes such as viruses as well as some bacteria are still capable of bypassing and crossing the blood brain barrier [83,84]. Substances entering the brain are mediated through a tight regulated systematic process of membrane transporters [82][83][84]. This tight regulatory system prevents most pharmacological antimicrobial agents from crossing the blood brain barrier and exercising their pharmacological activities [82][83][84]. In this regard nanotechnological antimicrobial agents could bring a novel dimensional approach that is capable of overcoming and bypassing the complex brain cell network, and inhibiting the brain pathogens, thus reducing the burden of microbial brain infections [85]. The NPs can potentially carry and potentially deliver antimicrobial across the blood brain barrier. In fact, it is known that NPs have very small nanosizes that exhibit vast physiochemical multifunctional properties that play a significant role of crossing the blood brain barrier with ease. These features of being able to transiting difficult biological system with ease without disrupting or damaging the cell membranes and sustaining the antimicrobials have made NPs and/or nanomaterials (nano-functionalizedligands) very attractive for biomedical applications [5,86]. For example, a single oral administration of polylactide-co-glycolide NP-encapsulated antituberculosis drugs consisting of rifampicin + isoniazid + pyrazinamide + ethambutol conjugate in murine mice was found to cross the blood brain barrier and sustained for 9 days in the brain [86].",

            "text": "Infections of the brain are often very difficult to treat because of the difficulty of most antimicrobial agents to cross the blood brain barrier and inhibit microbial agents [84]. This is due to the fact that the brain is made up of complex cell networks that filter foreign materials, protect and prevent the brain from injuries and diseases [83]. However, some small microbes such as viruses as well as some bacteria are still capable of bypassing and crossing the blood brain barrier [83,84]. Substances entering the brain are mediated through a tight regulated systematic process of membrane transporters [82][83][84]. This tight regulatory system prevents most pharmacological antimicrobial agents from crossing the blood brain barrier and exercising their pharmacological activities [82][83][84]. In this regard nanotechnological antimicrobial agents could bring a novel dimensional approach that is capable of overcoming and bypassing the complex brain cell network, and inhibiting the brain pathogens, thus reducing the burden of microbial brain infections [85]. The NPs can potentially carry and potentially deliver antimicrobial across the blood brain barrier. In fact, it is known that NPs have very small nanosizes that exhibit vast physiochemical multifunctional properties that play a significant role of crossing the blood brain barrier with ease. These features of being able to transiting difficult biological system with ease without disrupting or damaging the cell membranes and sustaining the antimicrobials have made NPs and/or nanomaterials (nano-functionalizedligands) very attractive for biomedical applications [5,86]. For example, a single oral administration of polylactide-co-glycolide NP-encapsulated antituberculosis drugs consisting of rifampicin + isoniazid + pyrazinamide + ethambutol conjugate in murine mice was found to cross the blood brain barrier and sustained for 9 days in the brain [86].",

            "text": "Diseases of the central nervous system (CNS), including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, stroke, and brain tumors, have affected the normal lives of an increasing number of people worldwide in recent years [1][2][3]. However, most therapeutic drugs are unable to enter the brain parenchyma to exert their effects due to the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), so more effective treatments need to be developed for central nervous system diseases. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of the physicochemical properties of BBB and its pathological changes in different CNS diseases is essential. The BBB is a highly selective semi-permeable barrier that exists between the CNS and blood. The primary role of the BBB is to control the flow of substances between the blood and the central nervous system according to the physiological needs of the brain. It safeguards the CNS from harmful toxins, pathogens, and foreign substances in the blood, while simultaneously supplying vital nutrients to brain tissue and eliminating waste products [4]. \n\nWith the development of nanotechnology, there has been a breakthrough in the harmless passage of drugs through the BBB for the treatment of CNS diseases. Nanoparticles provide targeted therapeutic and diagnostic effects due to higher drug loading and bioavailability, lower dosing frequency, good biocompatibility and biodegradability, greater stability, fewer side effects, and less invasiveness [5,6]. Encapsulation of drugs in NPs or coupling on their surfaces can be prepared as nanodrug delivery carriers [7]. Importantly, there are also nanoparticles that are not coupled to any drug and can be used as therapeutic agents themselves for specific diseases [8,9]. Nanomaterials such as inorganic nanoparticles and polymeric nanoparticles are being designed and developed as safe, effective and practical drug delivery vehicles for crossing the BBB for the treatment and diagnosis of CNS diseases (Fig. 1). However, the use of nanoparticles for the treatment of CNS diseases still has several issues that are yet to be resolved.",

            "text": "Diseases and disorders of the nervous system, like Parkinson disease (PD) and others neurodegenerative pathologies are widespread in our society. The arsenal of treatments against these pathologies continues to increase, but in many cases its use is limited. This is due to the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which acts by limiting the penetration of drugs into the brain. To overcome this handicap, in the current research solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNPs) able to encapsulate drugs and to cross the blood-brain barrier have been designed to transport and release these drugs into their targets. These SLNPs were synthesized by a sonication method and high agitation process searching the most adequate physicochemical profile to achieve the objectives set. Today, the most efficient treatment for PD consists of providing the dopamine (DP) that is lost by neurodegeneration; however, the nature of this neurotransmitter prevents its crossing of the BBB. Therefore, DP may be considered as a good candidate to be encapsulated in SLNPs while studying how the loading drug could affect such nanoparticles. Based on these antecedents, in this research, both empty and DP-charged SLNPs were characterized physicochemically. The results obtained indicated a great stability of the nanoparticles loaded with DP when drug was used at 0.2 to 0.05%; these concentrations barely affected its size, polydispersity and \u03b6-potential, and the SLNPs elaborated in this research were high appropriate to be injected systemically. Finally, empty SLNPs labeled and administered systemically to adult male Wistar rats demonstrate their penetration ability into the brain parenchyma.",

            "title": "Inflammaging and Brain: Curcumin and Its Beneficial Potential as Regulator of Microglia Activation",
            "text": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) between the blood and the CNS is able to exert the physiological function of regulating the exchange of molecules, cell infiltration and ionic homeostasis, thus preserving the brain microenvironment and protecting the CNS from circulating toxins or pathogens [116]. It is well known that the BBB is constituted of endothelial cells, which act as a protective shield by restricting entry of substances into the brain and molecules with high lipid solubility and low molecular weight easily cross this restrictive barrier into the brain. Curcumin's poor penetration through the BBB, combined with its chemical-physical properties, pose significant limitations for the use of these new systems in brain pathologies [117]. A number of studies have been carried out to determine both the formulation of curcumin to use in the brain as well as its distribution in the brain. In this context, a study compared the distribution of conventional curcumin with that of curcumin encapsulated in polylactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) nanoparticles in the brain, reporting that curcumin nanoformulations concentrated more in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus and had a longer retention time [118]. Moreover, curcumin nanoformulation analysis reveals that curcumin is distributed in the liver, heart, spleen, lung, kidney and especially in the brain (Figure 3) where nanoformulations seem able to highly increase curcumin bioavailability and its mean residence time as well as its anti-inflammatory properties [119]. These findings provide insight into the efficacy and limitations of curcumin use as a therapeutic agent for a variety of diseases. At the same time, it also suggests that curcumin in encapsulated form, increasing its bioavailability and efficacy, can be considered an excellent tool for the treatment of various diseases, including those that are inflammatory based which trigger and worsen with the aging process. \n\nIn recent years, many studies have been conducted, in vitro and in vivo, which have strongly evidenced that curcumin seems to have particularly protective effects in the context of neuroinflammation (Figure 4).",

            "text": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is an interface between central nervous system (CNS) and blood circulation. It limits exchange of substances between blood circulation and brain tissue to prevent the CNS from the blood-borne toxins but it hinders the systemic delivery of therapeutic drugs to the brain. 1,14 Over the last two decades, researchers have developed many methods to improve the brain drug delivery, one of which is to use nanoparticles (NPs) as drug carriers for drug delivery. 6,9,12,32,39 because NPs can be made nontoxic, biodegradable and biocompatible. They can also maintain physical stability in the blood and have relatively long blood circulation time. Most importantly, after being conjugated with specific antibodies or peptides, they have the ability to recognize targeting sites. 28 NPs, made of liposomes, polymers and metals, usually have diameters from 10 to 1000 nm. It has been found that NPs under 200 nm in diameter display a decreased rate of plasma clearance and thus an extended circulation time as compared to those with a larger diameter. 32,37 here are two transport pathways across the BBB, the paracellular and transcellular pathways. 14,29 Water and small hydrophilic solutes cross the BBB through the paracellular pathway, and the large molecules cross the BBB through transcellular pathways. 14,20,25,32,39 revious studies have investigated the transport across the BBB both in vivo and in vitro. By employing intravital and multiphoton microscopy, Yuan 45,46 and Shi et al. 35,36 developed a non-invasive method and quantified the permeability (P) of post-capillary venules either on rat pia mater or in brain parenchyma 100-200 lm below pia mater to various sized solutes and NPs. Meanwhile, in vitro BBB models by monoculturing or co-culturing brain microvascular endothelial cells (ECs) with astrocytes and/or pericytes 14,24 were developed for low cost, high-throughput screening, and easiness to assess compounds as well as to investigate the transport mechanism at molecular levels.",

            "text": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) poses a formidable challenge to drug delivery in the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) diseases. The BBB consists primarily of brain endothelial cells, forming a tight monolayer connected by intricate junctional complexes. Its precise functioning hinges on ongoing interactions with additional cellular constituents, including pericytes, astrocytes, neurons, or microglia, forming altogether the neurovascular unit (NVU) [1]. This cellular arrangement, along with the presence of efflux transporters and the lack of fenestrations, restricts the transport of molecules. While this barrier serves a crucial protective role for maintaining the homeostasis of the CNS microenvironment, it also poses a significant obstacle to brain drug delivery. Hence, effectively delivering drugs across the BBB represents a pivotal challenge in developing treatments for CNS disorders. Some of the most troublesome CNS diseases that could benefit from enhanced brain drug delivery include brain tumours, neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury or stroke. \n\nThe clinical demand for strategies facilitating brain delivery has prompted the exploration of diverse approaches to ensure safe and efficient targeted brain drug delivery. While the most advanced projects have progressed to clinical trials, none has resulted in the launch of new drugs thus far [2]. \n\nIn this context, nanomedicine emerges as a delivery platform with the potential to elevate the levels of therapeutic agents in the brain by improving the distribution of drugs across the cerebral endothelium [3]. The development of nanocarriers capable of effectively crossing the BBB can be achieved through passive, active, or physical targeting [4]. Passive targeting relies on exploiting the paracellular transport through fenestrations of damaged BBB, while active targeting involves the use of ligands that specifically bind to receptors overexpressed on the brain endothelium to drive BBB crossing. However, designing targeted delivery systems based on either of these inherent biophysical characteristics of the BBB can pose challenges given the heterogeneous idiosyncrasy of the brain vasculature. Alternatively, physical targeting utilizes external stimuli to enhance the delivery of nanoparticles to the brain.",

The memantine-loaded PLGA-PEO nanoparticles were prepared by the double emulsification W/O/W method. During the first step, the memantine was dissolved in deionized wa-ter. Then, this solution was emulsified in ethyl acetate containing dissolved PLGA-PEO copolymer. Eventually, the primary emulsion was emulsified in water containing the poly(vinyl alcohol) stabilizer. Evaporation of the liquid organic phase (ethyl acetate) produced a stable suspension of the memantine-loaded nanoparticles dispersed in the water continuous phase. The control memantine-free nanoparticles were produced similarly but without memantine addition. The fluorescent nanoparticles containing rhodamine were also prepared for the biodistribution studies. The research included comprehensive characterization of nanoparticles, in vitro studies of nanoparticles' interactions with cells (mouse microvascular endothelial cells (bEnd.3) and astrocytes from brain rat cortex, and in vivo studies using the mouse model. It should be noted that nanoparticles used in animal studies did not contain any special tags facilitating their crossing through the blood-brain barrier. Any traces of PVA, which were weakly adsorbed onto the particles, were removed by the repeated sequence of the centrifugation-isolation-resuspension steps. The most important results of the aforementioned studies are as follows: The orally administered memantine-loaded nanoparticles with diameters lower than 200 nm were transported from the gastrointestinal tract to the blood. Circulating with blood, they crossed the blood-brain barrier and, according to histological analysis, accumulated in brain tissue. The behavioral tests revealed that animals treated with the memantine-loaded nanoparticles had better learning capability than mice treated with unencapsulated memantine.",

            "text": "A variety of formidable obstacles hinder the entry of drugs into the CNS. These obstacles include physiological barriers, such as the BBB and the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier, as well as various efflux transporter proteins. In current clinical applications, ~98% of chemical drugs and 100% of protein peptide drugs cannot directly enter the brain. Because of their small size and functionalization potential, NPs can be utilized as carriers for drug delivery through the human physiological barriers. For example, the solubility of a poorly soluble drug can be improved by utilizing a drug delivery system containing both hydrophilic and hydrophobic elements. NPs have significant advantages over other currently available drug delivery systems for the delivery of drugs across the BBB. Intensive research and development is being conducted to exploit the biological effects of engineered NMs for therapeutic applications in the CNS. \n\nThe NMs used in drug-delivery systems can be divided into two types: soft NMs (lipid-or polymer-based) and hard NMs (often metals, metal oxides, or ceramics). Soft NMs have been widely applied in clinics for over a decade, and many new formulations are currently undergoing clinical trials. 14  contrast, hard NPs are not being widely implemented in clinical settings despite their substantial scientific improvements. 15 Some current NP-based strategies for brain-targeted drug delivery are listed in Table 2. The preparation of a flake-shell microcapsule is illustrated in Figure 1. \n\nNanoscaffolds for neuroregeneration: application of NPs in neural tissue engineering (neural tissue regeneration) \n\nA large proportion of the world's population suffer from traumatic injuries to the brain and spinal cord, which lead to permanent disability and thus a significant global health burden. However, only a few effective treatments are available because the CNS is refractory to axonal regeneration and relatively inaccessible to most drugs. 16 Nanoscaffolding is a medical process used for tissue regrowth, including limbs and organs. A nanoscaffold is a three-dimensional nanoscale structure composed of polymer fibers that allows damaged cell adherence and helps rebuild missing tissue. As the tissue grows, the scaffold is absorbed into the body and disappears completely. 17 Advances in nanotechnology have increased the potential for axonal regeneration after a brain injury.",

            "text": "However, this route poses several important challenges: the GIT is characterized by an extreme complexity, with different segments of this system having different pH, enzymes, cell populations, and the presence of mucus. Furthermore, several factors (intestinal flora, presence of food, GIT disorders) can alter the intestinal mobility, permeability, and microenvironment composition over time. Actually, there are very few studies regarding the GIT PC formation and composition of orally administered NP formulations (Berardi and Baldelli, 2019). This discrepancy calls for a more systematic study on how the presence of PC can influence the orally administered NP colloidal stability, drug release, and intestinal permeability. \n\nFinally, the presence of biological barriers that cannot be easily penetrated can be a limiting factor for NP biodistribution. One of these barriers is represented by the blood-brain barrier (BBB). However, little is known about how the PC of NPs changes when they cross this hurdle. One of the few studies on this topic is provided by Cox et al. (2018). In this work, the PC composition of 3.5 nm NPs is assessed before or after their crossing of a Transwell in vitro model of BBB. Interestingly, the PC composition is changed dramatically upon BBB crossing because of both the different protein composition of the two media and the crossing of the BBB, itself. Indeed, NPs interacting with intracellular compartments of BBB are exposed to different microenvironments that could alter the PC. Remarkably, this cell-based mechanism appears to be the most relevant, and the PC formed after BBB crossed appeared more stable, perhaps due to the cellular removal of a portion of PC proteins, leading to a stronger binding of the residual ones. After overcoming the BBB, NPs encounter a new biological compartment populated by neuronal and specialized immune cells (the microglia). For this reason, some studies also focused on the evaluation of PEG on the NPs targeting the efficiency of different CNS cell populations. Jenkins et al. demonstrated how the use of PEG to coat magnetic NPs reduced their uptake from CNS immune cells but at the same time also reducing the uptake from neurons (Jenkins et al., 2016).",

            "text": "The tight junctions of the microvascular endothelial cell lining in the cerebral capillary walls form the BBB [14]. The presence of various cell types (astrocytes, pericytes, microglia and endothelial cells) and the high selectivity of the BBB maintain a highly controlled environment in the brain. The entry of pathogens, large or hydrophilic molecules and the diffusion of solutes in the blood is restricted, whereas some small molecules (such as O2 and CO2) can move across the BBB through diffusion. Despite this, only approximately 2% of all small molecules can cross the BBB [14]. Therefore, due to difficulties in crossing the BBB and the removal of drugs by efflux pumps, drug delivery into the brain via the oral and intravenous routes is particularly challenging. Nanoparticles present unique opportunities in crossing the BBB owing to the flexibility in the modifications of their sizes, shapes, surfaces and physiochemical properties based on different synthesis and functionalisation processes. Nanoparticles are small particles (typically 1 to 100 nm in diameter) that can be synthesised from a range of organic, inorganic and carbon-based materials. Nanoparticles show size-dependent permeation across the BBB. A 2020 study investigated the optimal brain delivery size using gold nanoparticles enhanced by focused-ultrasound-induced BBB opening. It was reported that nanoparticles ranging from 3 to 200 nm are able to permeate through the BBB, and while smaller nanoparticles show greater permeation across the BBB, larger nanoparticles (200 nm) show greater accumulation in the brain due to slower clearance from the blood [15]. Furthermore, different functionalisation and conjugation strategies, for instance, the incorporation of specific ligands, have been shown to improve the targeting effects of drug delivery nanosystems. Here, we review various nanosystems that have been proposed as potential therapeutic agents against AD and summarise their key properties (Table 1). Liposomes are small, spherical vesicles that contain one or multiple phospholipid bilayers, which can be synthesised from cholesterol or non-toxic phospholipids.",

Moreover, these nano compounds pass through this barrier and reach neurons through different routes and give the essential theranostic effects on the diseased brain. 67 Several Nanoparticles have been used for crossing the BBB as these NPs penetrates through the tight junctions between the endothelial cells of the vessels and enable the drug to pass through the BBB. Endocytosis and transcytosis of NPs can also facilitate drug transfer through The lipophilic features of lipid NPs enable them to cross the BBB to enter the brain through multiple transport pathways, including paracellular pathway, transcellular pathway, transcytosis, and receptor mediated endocytosis all these are responsible for the transporting pathways for the nano-materials. 68,69 The latest strategies of nanotechnology with the enhancement of drug delivery in the brain is shown in Figure 4.

This passive diffusion accounts for the transport of solutes through the cell membrane, depending upon size and lipophilicity of the substances. 70 Carrier mediated transport (CMT) or carrier-mediated influx are forms of diffusion which may be passive or active, depending on the context, and involve the unidirectional transport of drugs from the blood to the brain.

            "text": "In the present study, systemically applied polymeric nanoparticles were shown to distribute mainly to the liver and spleen within 24 h after intravenous administration. To a lesser extent, uptake into the brain also occurred. In general, there were no statistically significant differences in brain uptake between the individual nanoparticles, besides a moderate higher accumulation of non-biodegradable NPs at 24 h. After crossing the blood-brain barrier, the NPs were internalized in microvascular endothelial cells, microglia, and astrocytes, as well as in neurons. Disruption of the blood-brain barrier, induced by controlled cortical impact, led to a highly significant increase in NP accumulation in the brain area directly adjacent to the lesion. The investigated NPs did not trigger activation of glial cells or increased release of proinflammatory cytokines in brain tissue in a period of 24 h after intravenous application. Taken together with the findings obtained in previous works, it can be summarized that BBB disruption in the context of TBI leads to a significant increase in NP uptake in the damaged brain area, thus opening a window for the targeted transport of neuroprotective agents for the treatment of secondary brain injury.",

            "text": "Because of their ability to transport bioactive molecules like proteins and encoding and non-coding RNAs between cells and organs, extracellular vesicles play a crucial role in cellular signaling [15]. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) [16], AAV vectors [17], erythrocyte membrane-encapsulated nanocarriers [18], cell-based delivery nanocarriers [19], injectable hydrogels [20], immunomodulators [21], and many other drug delivery technologies have been created to bypass the BBB. Surprisingly, EVs outperformed them all. \n\nRecently, exosomes have been identified as the most reliable biomarkers for disease diagnosis and the most efficient drug transporters for treating diseases [22][23][24]. Exosomes are endogenous, have good pharmacokinetics and unique immunological characteristics, and may pass physiological barriers, making them superior to synthetic drug delivery vectors like liposomes and nanoparticles [25]. Additional functionalities can be used upon exosomes and for site-specific medication delivery to surface changes [26]. When taken as a whole, these characteristics of exosomes make them helpful in identifying and treating central nervous system disorders. \n\nExosomes can deliver bioactive substances through a variety of pathways and safely and efficiently transfer bioactive substances to participate in cell metabolisms, such as tissue repair [27], immune regulation [28], and tumor therapy [29]. Exosomes can carry genetic material, have stable lipid membrane structure, and are widely distributed in body fluids and other essential characteristics of delivery carriers. These have gradually become an important direction of disease research as therapeutic carriers. The complex blood-brain barrier (BBB) exists in the central nervous system, which means the treatment of its diseases has certain limitations [30]. To some extent, the brain is shielded by a semipermeable but highly selective barrier called the blood-brain barrier. However, some therapeutic medications have trouble crossing the blood-brain barrier [31]. Exosomes' delivery carrier benefits allow them to traverse the blood-brain barrier with their cargo. Consequently, it is imperative to research medicine delivery based on exosomes [32,33].",

            "text": "As the world's population ages, neurological disorders are becoming more prevalent, drawing the attention of researchers worldwide (Deuschl et al., 2020). Over the last 30 years, neurological diseases have led to a dramatic rise in fatalities and disabilities, making them a major global public health issue (Feigin et al., 2020). The production of drugs for brain disorders on a global scale is expected to increase dramatically in the near future. Drug research for neurological disorders has been far from satisfactory when compared to that of other diseases; one of the major hindrances to the successful creation of medications for the management of neurological disorders is the inability for most drugs to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) (Banks, 2016;Yang et al., 2023). The BBB is a complex and delicate structure responsible for controlling the transport of substances between the brain and the blood, preserving ion homeostasis, and protecting brain nerve cells from any potentially harmful chemicals in the blood; unfortunately, it also blocks up to 95% of substances from becoming drugs for neurological disorders (Greene et al., 2019). To improve drug delivery to the brain, researchers have been working to create systems that are capable of efficiently crossing the BBB. To this end, novel drug delivery systems, such as liposomes, nanoparticles, and micelles, have been developed (Pardridge, 2022). Liposomes have become a widely used platform in drug delivery systems for the treatment of neurological disorders due to their enhanced bioavailability and stability, reduction in toxicity, and targeted release (Duong et al., 2023). \n\nCommon modifications that help liposomes cross the BBB include the following: (i) Surface functionalization of liposomes using polyethyleneglycol, which enables a longer circulation of liposomes and avoids rapid reticulo-endothelial system clearance (Lam et al., 2023); (ii) Surface design of bioactive ligands to increase the targeting of liposomes by enabling ligands to specifically bind to receptors or transporters that are highly expressed on brain endothelial cells.",

            "text": "The advent of nanomedicine has brought nanoparticles that provide unique ways to control interactions with cells and tissues. However, when facing the complexity of in vivo systems, nanoparticles are not simply required to interact with one singular cell type, but rather with several cellular environments with distinctive characteristics before reaching the intended target site. For disorders in the NVU, reaching the diseased site is even more complex, as the CNS is well-guarded by its own immune system and a specialized endothelial barrier. The treatment and diagnosis of diseases such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and brain cancers becomes challenging, as most molecules cannot reach the brain at therapeutically relevant doses. Nanocarriers pose as an auspicious concept for improving the delivery of therapeutics to the CNS. However, systemically administrated nanocarriers that target the brain must also overcome the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS) and be transported across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), a highly selective structure [1,2]. Crossing the BBB generally implies that the nanoparticles (NPs) should be internalized by endothelial cells and subsequently exocytosed into the brain (Figure 1). Furthermore, after reaching the brain, the nanocarriers need to get to the different brain areas for effective therapeutic delivery. To obtain systems with the most favorable results, understanding and tuning of nanocarriers properties is essential. The brain capillaries irrigate the brain parenchyma, and their structure is composed of specialized endothelial cells as well as pericytes and astrocytes. The endothelial cells display apical-basal polarity, and tight junctions separate the polarized membranes. To reach the brain, NPs will need to interact with the apical membrane, be internalized by the endothelium, and undergo vesicular trafficking and exocytosis. \n\nThe highly versatile nature of polymers offers exceptional opportunities to carefully modulate NP properties.",

            "text": "Despite advanced CNS drug discovery, the majority of the CNS disorders remain undertreated because of the lack of an effective drug delivery system. It is well accepted that the failure of therapy is attributed not only to the potency of the drugs, but also to the presence of barriers that hinder the efficient delivery of the molecule (such as BBB in the case of the brain). Additionally, large molecular mass hydrophilic molecules carrying charge further exaggerate the problems because of the very poor diffusional properties in the biological milieu. However, the poor aqueous solubility and low potency of therapeutic agents in the CNS lead to higher toxicity and major side effects, demanding potential delivery models for brain treatment. Table 3 lists clinical trials involving pharmaceutical formulations administered through transdermal and intranasal routes, specifically for brain disorders. \n\nGenerally, to enter the brain drugs should pass through the endothelial cells. Primarily there are two passages for this purpose that can be described as: (1) the paracellular pathway (between endothelial cells) which could be used for the transportation of ions and solutes crossing the BBB, and (2) the transcellular pathway/transcytosis (on the endothelial cells) which could be used for the transportation of many substances across the BBB. Normally, the transcellular pathway allows for the passive diffusion of lipophilic molecules with a size of less than 500 Da. It further allows for the transportation of gas molecules depending on specific receptors, the transportation of hydrophilic polar molecules such as glucose and proteins depending on specific transporters (e.g., GLUT-1, choline transporters and large-amino acid transporter 1 or specific receptors for transferrin, insulin, lipoprotein and interleukin-13). These mechanisms could be employed to design nanomaterials for crossing the BBB. Caveolae is another transportation pathway in the brain which depends on a formed vesicle around the molecules through cellular invagination. Currently, the transcellular pathway has been widely investigated and several approaches have been devised for the transportation of drugs into the brain. Nonetheless, the active efflux pumps lessen the BBB-crossing efficiency of most of the drugs [137].",

            "text": "Recent advances in micro-and nanotechnologies have greatly attracted the attentions of researchers for the development of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs). MNPs offer great advantages for the diagnostics of various diseases, such as glioblastoma, Alzheimer, and Epilepsy [1][2][3]. MNPs have also demonstrated great advantages as contrast agents for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Naturally occurring, the endothelium patterning around the cerebral micro vessels with strong tight junctions accurately controls the transportation of biomolecules necessary for neural signaling. However, the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) prevents the delivery of large drug molecules or NPs into the brain [4]. To overcome this problem, many papers have reported non-invasive chemical techniques to increase the permeability of the BBB [5][6][7]. Based on these papers, the improper surface chemistry hinders crossing through the BBB when the recognition of these NPs takes place along with receptors on the surface of the endothelial cells. Figure 1a shows the selectivity of these non-invasive chemical techniques that enable specific molecules to cross the BBB. As seen in Figure 1(a-i), there are many lipid-soluble molecules, or so-called Passive partitioners, that can cross the BBB and enter the Central Nervous System (CNS). The relation between the translocation rate and the degree of solubility of molecules in lipids has been elucidated in [5]. There are various methods for computing the permeability of the BBB for lipid-soluble non-polar molecules under the effect of passive diffusion. \n\nDiffusion parameters could then be evaluated based on experimental results. A rigorous formulation is provided for in vivo purposes. In addition to passive partitioners, there are many solutes and drugs called ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) transporters that have much lower CNS entry rates than expected. These substances are actively transported through the capillary endothelium by means of the ABC transporter family (Figure 1(a-ii)). As mentioned above, the chemical techniques for crossing the BBB are selective and they allow the translocation of nutrients that are necessary for metabolisms, such as glucose and amino acids.",

            "text": "Currently, more than one billion individuals worldwide suffer from brain disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease), ischemic strokes, brain cancers, epilepsy, and traumatic brain injuries. By 2020, the aforementioned conditions constituted 14.7% of all disorders worldwide [1]. Various therapeutic agents for brain disorders have been developed, and a few of them that received United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, have been used clinically for the treatment. In addition, natural compounds such as phyto-compounds, which are derived from plants, vegetables, and fruits, and dietary nutrients have frequently been used to exert therapeutic effects owing to their own antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective properties [2,3]. In patients with brain disorders, combinatorial therapy or co-administration of therapeutic drugs and natural compounds has been practiced frequently owing to synergistic therapeutic effects, multi-targeting effects, immune-boosting effects, preventive effects against other chronic diseases, and safety profiles of natural compounds [4,5]. \n\nHowever, when anti-brain disorder agents, herbal medicines, and/or other natural compounds are co-administered, harmful/impeditive drug interactions may occur owing to the changes in pharmacokinetic properties (e.g., absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion; ADME) and various drug transporters, particularly brain transporters [4,6]. These ADME-mediated natural compound-drug interactions (NDIs) can increase or decrease the systemic exposure of therapeutic drugs in plasma or brain thereby accelerating their therapeutic effects, occurring drug toxicity, or diminishing drug efficacy [6]. Induction or inhibition of drug transporters and metabolism enzymes by natural compounds can also lead to significant changes in drug exposure [7]. Moreover, membrane barriers like the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB), which affect drug distribution into the brain, can be changed depending on disease state, and various drug transporters in the barriers can be significantly upregulated or downregulated by some natural compounds [8,9].",

            "text": "The development of non-invasive therapeutics that can be administered intravenously remains a challenge for the treatment of neurological disorders, including glioma, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD), among others [1]. Nanoparticles (NPs) are a powerful vehicle for drug delivery, specifically for large macromolecules including RNA therapeutics and CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing proteins [2]. The advantages of NP encapsulation of therapeutics include prolonged circulation times, efficient transport through cell membranes via endocytosis, controlled release in target tissue, efficient drug loading, and reduced side effects [3][4][5]. Despite the significant advantages of NPs, there remain limitations in delivery and biodistribution to target tissues due to natural clearance to the liver and spleen and the presence of biological barriers [2]. One of the most restrictive biological barriers in the human body is the blood-brain barrier (BBB), a semi-permeable barrier that prevents ~ 98% of small molecule drugs and ~ 100% of macromolecule drugs from entering the brain parenchyma from the bloodstream [6]. The BBB consists of a layer of brain capillary endothelial cells (BCECs) connected by tight junctions, astrocytes, pericytes, and neurons, allowing only selected molecules to cross [1,7]. \n\nDue to their relatively large size, NPs primarily enter the brain via transcytosis across the brain endothelium. One method of increasing transcytosis is with active targeting, in which ligands with high affinity for specific receptors are conjugated to NPs to facilitate receptor-mediated transcytosis (RMT). In RMT, the targeting ligands mediate the binding of NPs to receptors on the surface of BCECs, inducing the formation of endosomes that engulf the NPs and traffic them through the cell for subsequent release into the brain parenchyma via exocytosis [1].",

            "text": "Nowadays, notable challenges are emerging in the development of useful therapeutic approaches for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) [1]. Thus, it is commonly accepted that the main obstacle for drug delivery in therapeutic concentrations to the brain is constituted by the blood brain barrier (BBB), which maintains the brain homeostasis and prevents the entry of substances that can cause neuronal damage [2]. This obstructing effect of the BBB is due to brain capillary endothelial cells, which limit the transcellular transport, as well as to the tight junctions between cells, that restrict the paracellular transport [3]. In general, in the case of NDs the BBB, even though compromised and more permeable, is still capable to protect the brain from the entry into it of dangerous molecules [2]. Hence, to treat NDs with the available drug delivery systems (DDS) and to slow down their progression, it is necessary to use high doses of therapeutic agents to gain appropriate BBB crossing [4]. In addition, the delivery of the therapeutic agent is often made by prolonged infusion or highly invasive procedures. Due to all these unfavourable factors, poor results have been observed in clinical trial studies employing current DDS for the treatment of neurological diseases [1]. \n\nA widely investigated approach to bypass the BBB is represented by the intranasal delivery of therapeutic agents allowing the direct access via nose-to-brain of the active using mainly the olfactory and trigeminal nerve transport pathways [5][6][7][8]. Moreover, intranasal delivery may also allow the indirect drug absorption by the lymphatic system and its successive transport into the systemic circulation [6]. In some circumstances, the nasal drug administration route may be even an effective alternative to the oral one [9]. This last, although characterized by patient compliance and the endorsement of pharmaceutical industry [10,11], may have some disadvantages for poorly soluble and/or unstable drug molecules in the gastrointestinal fluids [11].",

            "text": "In recent years, the field of nanotechnology has emerged as an important area of biomedical research. Nanoparticles (NPs) are studied in a variety of biological systems, and the use of NPs as novel therapeutic agents has been described in several experimental systems, such as cancer, eye diseases, diabetes, coronary artery disease, etc. [1][2][3][4]. While this disease model has shown promise for the use of NPs and nanocarrier drug delivery systems, the issues of biodistribution and toxicity need to be addressed. The nanosize dimensions of NPs have been reported to facilitate the crossing of several biological barriers such as the skin, tight junctions of various epithelial layers, and the blood-brain barrier (BBB) [5,6]. \n\nThe BBB is a tight barrier of cells which separates the circulating blood from the central nervous system (CNS). The walls of BBB capillaries are composed of brain capillary endothelial cells (BCEC), which form tight junctions. Tight junctions contain integral membrane proteins that form a seal between adjacent endothelial cells. In addition, accessory structures that surround the BCECs include pericytes, associated astrocytes and neurons [7][8][9]. While the BBB is essential for maintaining CNS function and homeostasis, it is also a major obstacle in the treatment of many brain diseases. The poor permeability of various drugs and delivery systems across the BBB is primarily due to tight junctions, lack of capillary fenestrations and presence of efflux transporters. The BBB can reportedly block more than 98% of CNS drugs [10]. Consequently, finding new ways to deliver therapeutic drugs to the CNS safely and effectively is essential. \n\nVarious drug delivery and targeting strategies to overcome the BBB are under investigation, and a number of nanoparticle delivery systems have shown promise [10][11][12][13]. One approach is the use of surface-modified polymeric nanoparticles as drug carriers, such as dendrimers.",

            "text": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a structure at the interface between the brain and the blood that strictly controls the brain homeostasis in association with the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB) and the ependymal barrier [1]. BBB is composed of a monolayer of endothelial cells (EC) joined by tight junctions, limiting the paracellular crossing, and surrounded by astrocytes and pericytes. In addition to the brain's physical protection, BBB exhibits biological characteristics improving its efficacy, such as a well-developed enzymatic function, a low number of pinocytosis vesicles, and a high proportion of mitochondria, reflecting its important metabolic activity [2]. Due to the presence of the BBB, most drugs are not able to passively access the brain if they do not meet certain characteristics, such as lipophilicity and a size smaller than 400 Daltons [3]. \n\nThe development of new BBB crossing strategies is a real challenge, and some invasive and non-invasive methods are available [2,4]. The first group (i.e., ultrasounds, microwaves, osmotic opening, etc.) leads to the BBB disruption (transient or not), which precludes their routine clinical implementation due to the crucial role played by this barrier in brain protection and homeostasis. The second group shows more interest by employing natural pathways to allow brain access while the BBB's integrity is preserved. If the use of the nasal pathway [5] and of non-specific pathways, such as the passive diffusion (lipidization) or the adsorptive-mediated transcytosis (cationization), is possible [6], the receptor-mediated transcytosis (RMT) offers the advantage to be specific. It involves the binding of a vector (i.e., endogenous ligand, antibody, or peptide), coupled with the molecule of interest, to a receptor that initiates the endocytosis of this receptor and leads to the transcytosis of the complex across the EC [7,8].",

            "text": "Low intracerebral drug concentrations have posed a significant challenge in the advancement of therapeutic strategies for central nervous system (CNS) diseases. The existence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and its selective permeability restricts the effective entry of pharmacological agents into the brain. 144 In recent years, a growing body of research has indicated that exosomes may serve as promising natural drug delivery systems (DDSs). Firstly, exosomes exhibit minimal immunogenicity, thereby enhancing drug efficacy and minimizing adverse reactions; 145 Secondly, their unique phospholipid-membrane-protein structure facilitates efficient intracellular delivery of therapeutic agents into target cells. 146 Additionally, exosomes demonstrate remarkable stability, which prevents phagocytosis by macrophages and extends the half-life of the drug; 147 Most importantly, the lipid bilayer of exosomes can assist in crossing natural barriers such as the blood-brain barrier (BBB), thereby improving the bioavailability of central nervous system (CNS) therapeutic drugs. 148,149 zheimer's Disease Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by progressive cognitive decline and memory impairment. 150 Silymarin (silibinin, Slb) has demonstrated therapeutic potential in AD by inhibiting amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) aggregation and suppressing astrocyte activation; however, its clinical application is limited due to low bioavailability. 151 In this study, Huo et al investigated the efficacy of exosome-encapsulated silymarin (Exo-Slb) in treating Alzheimer's disease. Specifically, Huo et al encapsulated Slb within macrophagederived exosomes (Exo-Slb), which upon entering the brain, selectively bind to A\u03b21-42 and inhibit the aggregation of A\u03b21-42. Additionally, Exo-Slb is internalized into astrocytes, where it regulates the nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) pathway to suppress astrocyte activation, thereby mitigating astrocyte-mediated neuronal damage and effectively alleviating cognitive deficits in AD mice.",

            "text": "Despite extensive advancements in targeting technologies, brain targeting is still considered challenging by formulation scientists, when it comes to drug delivery in the area of neurological disorders. Treatment of central nervous system (CNS) disorders is significantly hampered by the complex physiology of the brain, accounting for more than 7 million global deaths every year [1]. The brain is surrounded by biological obstacles such as blood-brain barrier (BBB) and efflux transporter proteins whereby tight junctions (TJ) and P-glycoprotein (Pgp) act as specialized interface between the systemic circulation, i.e., blood and brain parenchyma [2]. These obstacles behave as gatekeepers, hence, systemic delivery of majority of neurotherapeutics in the form of conventional oral dosage form is rendered ineffective, as the desired concentration is not achieved in the brain. In addition to that, therapeutics given via oral route have to face a challenging gastrointestinal environment and hepatic-first pass metabolism, followed by crossing BBB, drugs reach to the brain. As a result, conventional drug delivery is often marred with lower concentration, poor efficacy, side-effects associated with systemic exposure, and frequent dosing. To overcome these limitations, drug may be delivered directly to the brain by overcoming and/or disrupting BBB. \n\nDrug delivery strategies across the BBB comprises of either invasive methods involving risky surgical interventions or patient-friendly non-invasive approaches like chemical or biological modifications and intranasal delivery. Invasive methods like BBB disruption, intracerebral implants, or intraventricular infusion involve irreversible disruption of barrier integrity, often resulting into severe neurological changes, alteration of brain functions, and brain abscess on prolonged time [3]. In contrast, non-invasive intranasal (IN) route avoids surgical procedures and delivers drugs directly to the brain through the olfactory or trigeminal pathway by overcoming the BBB. To some extent, IN route also delivers drug systemically crossing BBB. Rich vasculature, avoidance of first-pass metabolism, rapid onset of action, and very less systemic exposure are key advantages, making IN route promising over other delivery routes [4].",

            "text": "The essential interface between the CNS and periphery is called blood brain barrier mainly constituted by endothelial cells connected by tight junctions and adherens junctions and a sparse layers of pericytes (Thomsen et al., 2013;Mc Carthy et al., 2015;Saraiva et al., 2016). Blood brain barrier is a physical, metabolic and transport barrier which controls the transfer of substances from blood to neuro tissues and vice versa (Rhim et al., 2013;Oller-Salvia et al., 2016). The blood brain barrier was first put forward by Goldman based on the previous hypothesis by Lewandowsky which states that there is a barrier between blood and barrier prevents the transfer of dyes (Jiang et al., 2018). The function of BBB includes maintaining the ion balance, nutrient transporter and the barrier to protect the brain pathogens (Patel & Patel, 2017). However, the BBB is the blocking barrier for neuro pharmaceuticals drugs because 100% of large molecule drugs and 98% of small drugs cannot penetrate through the barrier (Pardridge, 2007;Jiang, 2013;Kreuter, 2014;Xie et al., 2019). The partial disruption of BBB leads to stroke which is evident in 33% of ischemic human patients. If the BBB gets disrupted, the ischemia was observed in 4 to 5 h in experimental rats and 12.9 h in humans (Han et al., 2016). In addition to that, the degree of leakage is not sufficient for delivery of important drugs for effective ischemic treatment and the BBB crossing was confronted as big challenge in drug delivery. \n\nThe development of drug delivery systems for the treatment of brain diseases received paramount interest in recent decades. Brain diseases are poorly treated and have to grow in an aggressive manner in the future as the population of CNS patients and brain disorders are increasing (Dong, 2018). Recent progress in nanotechnological fields paved the way for the design strategies and synthesis of novel nanostructures for biomedical applications. Nanotechnology also provides further insight in the accurate control over drug-cellular interactions and in vitro prediction of cell responses in CNS based on their stimulation to molecular characteristics.",

            "text": "Over the past three decades, there has been a substantial increase in the prevalence of neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and dementia 39 , which is exacerbated by the growth of the aging population. Additionally, there has been a significant rise in the incidence of cancer metastases to the brain 40 . Despite research aimed at developing new drugs to treat these conditions, the presence of the bloodbrain barrier (BBB) remains a significant obstacle to the clinical application of new therapeutics. Consequently, there is a demand for innovative methodologies that can improve the uptake of existing and new BBB-impermeable drugs. As an alternative to expensive animal models, this study presents a novel approach in which we have developed a 3D, multicellular human brain spheroid model that closely mimics the BBB both structurally and functionally. Unlike the physiological cylindrical geometry of the microcirculation wherein a microbubble would be boundaried by the vessel wall, our BBB model is spherical, and the microbubbles are surrounded by culture medium, which might have influenced some of the responses we observed. However, despite this dissimilarity in physical set-up, our spherical BBB model has provided valuable insights into certain aspects of BBB behavior www.nature.com/scientificreports/ and drug permeability, contributing to our understanding of the essential functions of the BBB and its response to UTMC. Further research and modeling refinements may help bridge this gap. UTMC is a novel technology that has garnered significant interest for its potential to transiently open the BBB and improve drug delivery 41 . In our spheroid model, we show that UTMC enhances drug permeability. Further experiments using chemical inhibitors indicated that UTMC-induced Ca 2+ influx and nitric oxide production regulate hyperpermeability. With a functional BBB at the periphery and a complex assembly of other brain cell types at the core, our 3D brain spheroid model provides a system for studying pathways regulating BBB permeability. \n\nPrevious studies have successfully generated complex brain organoids using iPSCs, closely mimicking in vivo physiology [42][43][44][45] .",

            "text": "One of the major challenges in the neurological field is the development of therapeutics for brain diseases. In the past decades, clinical trials for treatment of brain disorders ranging from Alzheimer disease (Cummings, 2018) to glioblastoma (Jacus et al., 2016) have led to failure, almost without exception. This is largely due to the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which is a major hurdle for delivery of drugs from the blood to the brain interstitium, since the BBB only allows for passage of small molecules that are both lipid-soluble and have a molecular weight of <400-500 Da (Pardridge, 2005). This precludes the use of ~98% of all small molecules, and all large molecule therapeutics (such as monoclonal antibodies, recombinant proteins, gene therapeutics) (Pardridge, 2005). Many attempts have been made to re-engineer drugs in order to circumvent the BBB, e.g. through nanocarriers (Beduneau et al., 2007), receptor-mediated transport (Giugliani et al., 2018) or ultrasound-induced BBB disruption (Carpentier et al., 2016), but with limited success. Thus, a drug delivery platform to transport therapeutics across the BBB, where they can exert their effects locally in the brain parenchyma, would be a major step forward in this field. \n\nIn previous studies we observed that flow-obstructing, polystyrene particles with diameters of 15 to 50 micrometer that were injected intra-arterially into the rat brain extravasated from the vessel into the brain tissue over the course of several weeks (van der Wijk et al., 2019Wijk et al., , 2020)). This process was previously observed in the mouse brain, lungs, heart and retina (Lam et al., 2010;Grutzendler et al., 2014), and in the human retina (Cho et al., 2016) and was coined angiophagy (Grutzendler et al., 2014).",

            "text": "In recent decades, neurodegenerative disorders, cerebral neoplasms, and other neurological diseases have imposed a significant economic burden on society [1,2]. Research shows that in 2021, around 3.4 billion people (95% uncertainty interval: 3.2 billion to 3.62 billion) suffered from neurological disorders, accounting for 43.1% (40.5% to 45.9%) of the global population, leading to 11.1 million (9.75 million to 13.8 million) deaths [3]. In 2017, the economic burden of Parkinson's disease in the U.S. was estimated at USD 51.9 billion, with projections suggesting a substantial rise by 2037 [4]. Nevertheless, the availability of clinically applicable diagnostic and therapeutic approaches remains inadequate, and the efficient delivery of pharmacological agents to the brain has emerged as a critical obstacle hindering advancements in the treatment of these brain disorders [5][6][7][8]. The robust structural integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) alongside its selective permeability mechanisms presents significant challenges in drug delivery systems [9][10][11][12]. Composed of vascular endothelial cells and interconnected tight junctions, along with a complete basement membrane, pericytes, and astrocytes, the BBB meticulously regulates molecular transport within the central nervous system. This regulation is crucial for maintaining homeostasis, safeguarding the neural milieu, and preventing the ingress of blood cells, plasma constituents, and potentially harmful exogenous substances into the cerebral environment [13,14]. Due to these physiological conditions, the majority of pharmacological interventions designed to modulate pathophysiological processes or address central nervous system (CNS) disorders, as well as other cerebral conditions, are unable to permeate the BBB via systemic circulation. This limitation effectively restricts their access to the affected brain regions, thereby impeding optimal drug delivery. Consequently, there is an urgent clinical necessity for the development of an innovative drug delivery system capable of circumventing the BBB to enhance therapeutic effectiveness [15,16]. \n\nThe significance of nanoparticle delivery technologies and alternative therapeutic approaches is becoming increasingly evident in this scenario.",

            "text": "Cell encapsulation technology represents an alternative approach to the delivery of biologically active compounds to the brain by overcoming the problem of graft rejection [157]. This strategy involves the use of untreated or genetically engineered cells that secrete proteins with therapeutic potential. Cells are immobilized within a polymeric semi-permeable membrane that permits the bidirectional diffusion of molecules such as the influx of oxygen, nutrients, growth factors, essentials for cell metabolism and the outward diffusion of waste products and therapeutic proteins. At the same time, the semipermeable nature of the membrane prevents the grafted cells being exposed to host immune cells and antibodies, avoiding their destruction (Fig. 4) [158,159]. Through the release of therapeutic proteins, the grafted encapsulated cells can modify a circumscribed brain microenvironment or the whole brain milieu when transplanted into the CSF, and provide clinical benefits [132,160,161]. \n\nThe use of an appropriate material with the property of biocompatibility is a crucial factor that governs the long term efficiency of this technology. The ideal capsule should need to be implanted only once in a patient's lifetime; provide stable, predictable and reproducible function for a given period of time, and not burden the patient with immune suppressive regimens, discomfort, or other adverse effects. At present, alginates are regarded as the most suitable biomaterials for cell encapsulation due to their abundance and excellent biocompatibility properties [162,163]. New polymers are being tested to be used as carriers and scaffolds for biomolecules and cell delivery in tissue engineering applications [159]. Encapsulation devices range from 'microscale' devices (100 nm-1 mm) to 'macroscale' (3-8 cm). Microcapsules, by virtue of their size, have a shorter diffusion distance for oxygen and other nutrients. However, they are mechanically and chemically fragile and cannot be retrieved once implanted within the brain parenchyma. Macrocapsules provide good cell viability and neurochemical diffusion, have good mechanical stability, and can be retrieved if needed or desired [159,161].",

            "text": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a multicellular neurovascular unit that acts as a highly impermeable cellular barrier which tightly regulates brain homeostasis. It is mainly composed of vascular endothelial cells, and physically connected with astrocyte endfeet and pericytes embedded in the vascular basement membrane to form continuous tight junctions (TJs) [1]. Explicitly illustrated in Figure 1, the endfeet of astrocytes represent nearly 99% of the luminal surface area of brain capillaries and extend into the vessel wall. Pericyte contributes to maintain and stabilize the monolayer of endothelial cells in the brain, and is essential for constituting the TJs. The interaction of these three types of cells makes the BBB a dynamic structure to regulate brain homeostasis, protect the central nerve, and respond to different physiological and pathological states, limiting the simple diffusion of blood-borne pathogens to the CNS. Also, the BBB relies on other biological macromolecules such as microglia and enzymes, to form physical, metabolic and immune barriers, strictly restricting the entry of drugs into the brain. About 98% of small molecules and almost all large molecules (for example: monoclonal antibodies and recombinant proteins), they cannot pass through the BBB. The movement of pharmacological agents from the blood circulation into the brain is influenced by the molecular weight, size, surface charge, hydrophobicity, hydrogen bond, and the affinity of the drug or drug carrier to the receptor expressed in the BBB. Obviously, the modification of the drug can reduce such effects, so as to achieve the effect of crossing the BBB. \n\nIn the past decade, there are many explorations into trans-BBB delivery systems. The following are several solute or substance transport mechanisms through the BBB [2]. First, some molecules of gases (such as O 2 and CO 2 ) and small lipophilic molecules (less than 400 Da) can be smoothly dispersed outside the endothelium. Water-soluble agents are transported through the paracellular pathway; lipidsoluble small agents, such as corticosteroids and alcohol, cross BBB by simple diffusion.",

As a new anti-cancer drug paclitaxel encapsulated in PVP nanoparticles in vivo experiments, the tumor size of tumor-bearing mice was reduced and the survival time was evaluated for effi cacy. The results showed that paclitaxel was less than the free paclitaxel nanoparticles the efficacy of the concentration was significantly increased.

Studies have shown that modifi ed nanoparticles can pass through the blood-brain barrier, which acts as a drug delivery to the central nervous system. Camptothecin solid lipid nanoparticles were injected into mice and found that camptothecin was enriched in rat brain, liver, heart, spleen, brain AUC/dose and MRT increased by 10.4 and 4 times, so this nano granules can pass the blood-brain barrier, which is of special signifi cance for the treatment of brain tumors [21].",

            "text": "The therapeutic potential of NPs exposure depends chiefly on the rate of NP penetration when delivered from the external environment to the internal bio-compartments. Thus, biological barriers are central in determining the biological impact of NP exposure. Nanomaterials offer enormous potential for therapeutics and diagnosis, but also raise the possibility of unintended access to the brain (Herda et al., 2014). In vivo studies showed that NP could be found in the CNS upon various ways of administration (Semmler-Behnke et al., 2008;Zensi et al., 2009Zensi et al., , 2010. In parallel, in vitro models of human and murine BBB have been used and developed for the investigation of NP translocation (Andrieux and Couvreur, 2009;Ragnaill et al., 2011;Bramini et al., 2014;Herda et al., 2014;Raghnaill et al., 2014).\n\nNumerous nano-delivery systems have been proposed and tested for therapeutic purposes, both in vitro and in vivo (Pandey et al., 2015). Amongst the state-of-the-art systems, polymeric NPs are promising because of their high drug encapsulation capacity, so they protect and transport hydrophobic drugs without damaging the BBB structure (Tosi et al., 2008). Binding apolipoprotein E to NPs has been suggested as a mechanism via which NPs could utilize existing pathways to access the brain (Kreuter et al., 2002;Wagner et al., 2012), and it indeed enhances the uptake of drugs (Michaelis et al., 2006). This approach is particularly promising with liposomes, which are highly biocompatible (Re et al., 2011). In general, exploiting receptor-mediated transcytosis by linking specific peptides to the NP surface has been the most studied system in the field of BBB crossing. Various molecules, such as transferrin, insulin, lectin and lipoproteins, physiologically use this route to pass from the blood stream to the brain; thus these ligands could increase the passage ratio of drug-loaded NPs through the BBB for therapeutic purposes (Herda et al., 2014;Pande",

The niosome technology and application of borneol enhanced the sustained release of the drug and its ability to traverse the blood-brain barrier, providing a foundation for the treatment of brain diseases, such as Parkinson's and AD, with GB and Pue composite drugs. Nevertheless, the location of borneol modification and the enhancement of blood-brain barrier penetration require further exploration.",

            "text": "These differences include the lack of fenestrations and presence of tight junctions, as well as extremely low transcytosis activity compared to capillaries from the periphery. In the brain, the endothelial cells, pericytes, and basement membrane proteins, as well as the end-feet of astrocytes, form the blood-brain barrier (BBB) [18]. Although small molecules may easily cross the BBB via several pathways [19], under normal conditions, the BBB prevents the crossing of most molecules [20]. \n\nNanotechnology offers new approaches for crossing the BBB [19]. In specific, NPs have several properties that enable them to cross the BBB, including their small size and surface current potential [21]. Chitosan is a cationic polymer and when used as coating of NPs increases their permeability through the cellular membrane, which is negatively charged [7,22]. As shown in our biodegradation studies, NPs without chitosan coating tend to self-organize in clusters that may lead into the formation of aggregations. These aggregations, though not large enough to act as emboli, affect the potential toxicity of NPs, by altering their molecular interactions with various proteins and other macromolecules [23]. It should be noted that particles larger than 300 nm can be eliminated from the human body by resident macrophages [24]. Our hypothesis is that the endothelial cells of the BBB are affected by the increased toxicity of NPPs in their capacity to effectively provide the brain with oxygen. This is supported by the fact that the brain lesions were compatible with acute ischemia and the changes in the endothelial cells and perivascular edema that were observed in our study. This is not at all the case when the NPs are created with the addition of a cationic polymer, like chitosan, that biodegrade without forming aggregates [9] and thus without affecting the endothelial cells. \n\nBoth NP types were loaded with curcumin, a drug with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties [1], and this may explain why the inflammatory response was mild.",

            "text": "The blood-brain interfaces restrict the cerebral bioavailability of pharmacological compounds. Various drug delivery strategies have been developed to improve drug penetration into the brain. Most strategies target the microvascular endothelium forming the blood-brain barrier proper. Targeting the blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier formed by the epithelium of the choroid plexuses in addition to the blood-brain barrier may offer added-value for the treatment of central nervous system diseases. For instance, targeting the CSF spaces, adjacent tissue, or the choroid plexuses themselves is of interest for the treatment of neuroinflammatory and infectious diseases, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, selected brain tumors, hydrocephalus or neurohumoral dysregulation. Selected CSF-borne materials seem to reach deep cerebral structures by mechanisms that need to be understood in the context of chronic CSF delivery. Drug delivery through both barriers can reduce CSF sink action towards parenchymal drugs. Finally, targeting the choroid plexus-CSF system can be especially relevant in the context of neonatal and pediatric diseases of the central nervous system. Transcytosis appears the most promising mechanism to target in order to improve drug delivery through brain barriers. The choroid plexus epithelium displays strong vesicular trafficking and secretory activities that deserve to be explored in the context of cerebral drug delivery. Folate transport and exosome release into the CSF, plasma protein transport, and various receptor-mediated endocytosis pathways may prove useful mechanisms to exploit for efficient drug delivery into the CSF. This calls for a clear evaluation of transcytosis mechanisms at the blood-CSF barrier, and a thorough evaluation of CSF drug delivery rates.",

BBB is a highly complex structure that tightly regulates the movement of ions of a limited number of small molecules and of an even more restricted number of macromolecules from the blood to the brain, protecting it from injuries and diseases. However, the BBB also significantly precludes the delivery of drugs to the brain, thus, preventing the therapy of a number of neurological disorders. As a consequence, several strategies are currently being sought after to enhance the delivery of drugs across the BBB. Within this review, the recently born strategy of brain drug delivery based on the use of nanoparticles, multifunctional drug delivery systems with size in the order of one-billionth of meters, is described. The review also includes a brief description of the structural and physiological features of the barrier and of the most utilized nanoparticles for medical use. Finally, the potential neurotoxicity of nanoparticles is discussed, and future technological approaches are described. The strong efforts to allow the translation from preclinical to concrete clinical applications are worth the economic investments.",

            "text": "However, some structural aspects need to be kept in mind when considering the blood-CSF barrier for drug delivery.While crossing the BBB might lead to a wider brain distribution, targeting the blood-CSF barrier might provide primarily drug delivery to the CSF and subsequently the CSF-brain contact surfaces [25,29].Consequently, this strategy might be more valid when the drug target is located in the ventricular, cisternal or subarachnoid spaces and surrounding areas.This might be the case for neuroinflammatory and infectious diseases, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, selected brain tumors, hydrocephalus or neurohumoral dysregulation [25].Whether CSF delivered components might also reach deeper brain tissue penetration, is still a matter of dispute and needs to be further investigated [25,30,31].In general, CSF distribution into brain tissue depends on diffusion only, which means the component concentration decreases logarithmically with distance [29].However, the penetration also depends a lot on the exact component characteristics such as size, charge and lipophilicity [32].Nevertheless, if a more continuous secretion or delivery could be achieved, extended diffusion and consequent deeper tissue penetration might be reached [27,33].Overall, detailed studies are needed to characterize the transport mechanisms at the blood-CSF barrier.Furthermore, the influence of factors such as CSF clearance flow rate and other cell layers to overcome (e.g., the ependymal cell layer lining the brain ventricles, the pia mater and glia limitans layers at the brain surface and the perivascular spaces) need to be further investigated [25,26].It was for example reported that the pial membrane does not seem to impede molecule entry from CSF to the brain, while the dense network of glial cells in the glia limitans may slow down diffusion or be a site of accumulation [34].Interestingly, while vesicular transport seems limited in the cerebral endothelial cells [35], both clathrin-coated and non-clathrin-coated vesicles seem very abundant in the CP epithelium [36].",

            "text": "While the blood brain barrier (BBB) is potentially an obstacle to effective immunotherapy in neurodegenerative disorders, in this section we briefly discuss that it is not an absolute hurdle and that novel approaches can promote the entry of antibodies, across the BBB, into the brain. The BBB clearly limits the transport of substances from the peripheral circulation into the central nervous system [35]. The BBB concept comprises a monolayer of brain endothelial cells that exhibit interconnected transmembrane tight junctions, resulting in a low permeability of molecules, including antibodies, from the blood to the brain [36][37][38][39][40]. Transporters and enzymes present on both sides of the BBB regulate the movement of substances between the periphery and the extracellular space of the central nervous system [41]. Astrocytes and pericytes surrounding the endothelial cell layer are believed to contribute to BBB integrity [38]. Given this tight regulation surrounding the central nervous system, the permeability of antibodies is low with approximately 0.1-0.2 % of peripherally administered antibody crossing the BBB and gaining access to the extracellular space of the central nervous system [36]. Evidence from AD immunotherapy studies demonstrate that anti-A\u2424 antibodies cross the BBB, albeit at a low rate [42][43][44] and A\u2424-directed IgG antibodies cross the BBB using extracellular pathways [40]. A brain-to-blood efflux system may exist at the BBB for IgG molecules [45]. A promising approach for targeting antibody therapeutics to the brain is through receptor-mediated transcytosis. The specificity of this mechanism for antibody delivery takes advantage of endogenous receptors expressed on the luminal side of the BBB that normally function to deliver macromolecule nutrients to the brain [46][47][48]. Future trials might be able to take advantage of receptor-mediated transcytosis to improve the efficacy of immunotherapies for neurodegenerative diseases.",

            "text": "The central nervous system (CNS), which includes the brain and spinal cord, is the body's top organ for regulating and controlling numerous functional processes. The peripheral nervous system connects it to other bodily systems and organs. Because many medications cannot cross the bloodbrain barrier to treat CNS diseases, therapy options are restricted (Srikanth and Kessler, 2012). Many biological barriers may be crossed by Exos, making drug-loaded Eexos a promising therapy option for CNS diseases, according to research (Srikanth and Kessler, 2012) (Table 6). \n\nMedications may have a hard time getting into the brain because of the blood-brain barrier. Anticancer medicines delivered through brain endothelium-derived Exos decreased cancer cell fluorescence and tumor growth indicators considerably, demonstrating that Exos may transfer pharmaceuticals across the blood-brain barrier and display beneficial therapeutic effects as a drug delivery mechanism (Yang et al., 2015). The blood-brain barrier may be repaired using endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFC) obtained from human umbilical cord blood. There is evidence to suggest that tissue-resident endothelial cells (EC) produced from the ECFC increased proliferation and migration of this kind of EC in mice's brain, therefore repairing the damaged blood-brain barrier. Certain origin Exos have been shown to pass the blood-brain barrier and have favorable impacts on the blood-brain barrier's overall integrity (Gao et al., 2018). \n\nUsing gold nanoparticles, researchers loaded markers into bone marrow mesenchymal cell-derived Exos (MSC-exos) and tracked the distribution of these Eexos in mice with various neurological disorders such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and stroke using conventional X-ray computed tomography CT techniques. The results showed that MSC-Exos can be acquired by neuronal cells in disease areas to track the severity of the condition and can be used for targeted drug (Perets et al., 2019). Toxicities of adeno-associated virus (AAV) can be reduced by combining Exos with AAV, and this combination can also slow the rapid clearance of AAV vectors.",

The disease affects more than 1900 people per 100,000 aged 80 years and above. Furthermore, men are 1.5 times more prone than their counterpart. Potential biomarkers escalated the precise diagnosis and helped to initiate treatment to limit its adversity. The current therapeutic schemes are focused on administration of Dopamine precursor, Dopamine agonist, Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor, Catechol-o-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitors and deep brain stimulation. The CNS delivery focuses mainly on increasing the dopamine level in the brain. CNS drug delivery faces a crucial challenge of crossing Blood Brain Barrier. Blood-Brain Barrier Penetration can be attained by several techniques. Conventional drug therapy yields harmful affects to the patients without much therapeutics. It is visible that crossing BBB is quite strenuous process. It is mandatory for developing a novel approach untangling these situations. Nanotechnology-based formulations like nanosuspensions, nanotubes etc. promotes the penetration of drug across the sophisticated barrier without creating any deterioration to cells or organs. Several novel routes for drug administration reduce dose intake with increased and precise pharmacological action. Nanoformulations and Novel routes of drug administration are a promising tool to enhance the action of drug which helps to abate the symptoms of the Disease and assist in the betterment in treatment.",

            "text": "The present study provides experimental evidence for the morphogenic effects of the neuropeptide NGF, encapsulated inside biodegradable LbL-microcapsules, on primary hippocampal neurons. Our findings demonstrate, firstly, the applicability of this type of carriers for localized delivery of bioactive compounds, such as neurotrophins, to the environment of nerve cells. Secondly, they suggest that the targeted delivery of NGFloaded microcapsules has the potential to provide axonal guidance and synapse formation for central neurons during development. The key application strategy that we foresee for NGF-loaded capsules is not related to their systemic application or blood-brain barrier issues. We see the potential use of such microcapsules as a tool to help enable axonal outgrowth, trajectory guidance, and synapse formation among damaged or malformed nerve fibres in situ. We believe that it is by placing the capsules directly (via surgery or micro-injection) in the region(s) requiring axonal reconstruction, with high spatial precision, that the effect could be achieved. Clearly, further studies in vivo would be necessary to confirm the cargo system applicability in an intact brain.

            "text": "Brain disorders, such as neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) and tumors (more than 600 pathologies), are a serious health problem, resulting in brain dysfunctions that limit normal activities, with a significant economic impact [1]. The major difficulty for the treatment of brain diseases is the presence of biological barriers (the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier) limiting brain accessibility and reducing the efficacy of therapies, with a number of side effects due to the dispersion of the drugs which fail to enter the central nervous system (CNS) [2,3]. Furthermore, it is important to administer therapeutic agents to the brain lesions present in different regions of the CNS without affecting other normal CNS tissues in order to avoid further damage. In addition, at the cellular level, it is very important that formulations may selectively target the specific brain cells (neuron, microglia, oligodendrocytes or astrocytes) involved in different brain pathologies. \n\nIn this context, the nanobiotechnology approach should offer unique opportunities to (i) improve drug bioavailability (the protection of a drug from degradation); (ii) overcome physiological barriers; (iii) enable targeted delivery and controlled release; and, consequently, (iv) reduce the doses and frequency of administration by limiting potential adverse effects. All of these advantages would allow an increase in the efficacy of therapies for the treatment of brain disorders. Several studies have focused on developing drug delivery systems (DDSs) for the brain, such as nanoparticles, dendrimers, liposomes, vesicles and nanogels [3][4][5][6][7], as a potential approach to contrast NDs. \n\nMoreover, magnetic nanoparticles have received much attention as systems for the treatment of cerebral pathologies. In particular, they have been chosen for their ease of preparation and their advantageous properties such as composition, size, surface morphology, functionalization and ability to cross the BBB, which could be very promising for future clinical applications [8,9]. \n\nRecently, brain delivery systems capable of transporting organelles such as mitochondria have also been designed [10,11].",

As such, it is a relevant therapeutic target against which drugs have to be proposed. Targeting neuro-inflammation implies crossing the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) to reach the Central Nervous System (CNS). Engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) are promising candidates to carry and deliver drugs to the CNS by crossing the BBB. There are several strategies to design ENPs intended for crossing through the BBB. Herein, we first put nanotechnologies back in their historical context and introduce neuro-inflammation and its consequences in terms of public health. In a second part, we explain how ENPs can get access to the brain and review this area by highlighting recent papers in the field. Finally, after pointing out potential guidelines for preclinical studies involving ENPs, we conclude by opening the debate on the questions of nanosafety and toxicity of these ENPs and in particular on ecotoxicity related to regulatory issues and public concerns.",

            "text": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) separates the central nervous system (CNS) from the systemic circulation. The barrier characteristics of BBB depend on the properties of the brain endothelial cells that constitute the walls of the blood vessels. There are many neurological diseases such as neurological infections, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, age-related neurodegenerative diseases, and cerebral ischemia, that require a therapy in which the drug must reach the brain. Furthermore, many of these diseases need chronic therapies. Drug targeting to the brain represents a big challenge because many of these drugs do not cross BBB. Therefore, many efforts must be done for the design of strategies to solve this problem. The use of the nose-to-brain delivery route is an important and noninvasive method of drug delivery to bypass the BBB. In fact, it is well-known that there is an intranasal direct anatomical connection between the nasal cavity and the CNS, which suggests the development of nasal formulations for brain targeting of drugs. \n\nDifferent strategies have been developed for nose-to-brain drug delivery, that also involve nanomedicine with different kinds of nanocarriers: polymeric nanoparticles, nano-emulsions, dendrimers, and nano-micelles. These systems can also be bioadhesive. The development of new nasal systems represents a great challenge in the field of controlled drug targeting and delivery. \n\nThis Special Issue was intended to highlight the current progress in the use of the nasal route for brain targeting. A series of research articles and reviews are here present and offer a summary of researches by different groups, making a significant contribution in the field. \n\nThe research section includes five papers. Bonferoni et al. proposed a chitosan salt of chitosan and oleic acid, chitosan oleate, as amphiphilic polymer to obtain polymeric nano-micelles loaded with geraniol, an acyclic monoterpene [1]. Geraniol is abundant in essential oils extracted from aromatic plants and it has anticancer and neuroprotective properties.",

            "text": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is composed of a tightly organized subset of cells, often referred to as the neurovascular unit (NVU) that controls the transport of molecules from the blood into the brain [1][2][3][4]. The prototypical NVU consists of endothelial cells connected by tight junctions to form microvessels, where the luminal surface of the polarized endothelial cells is in contact with blood and the basal surface is coated by an acellular basement membrane comprised mainly of extracellular matrix proteins such as collagens and laminins (Fig. 1A). This vascular basement membrane layer is further surrounded by pericyte cells and can merge with a parenchymal basement membrane in areas without pericytes [5]. Outside of the parenchymal basement membrane, astrocyte endfeet surround the vessel and provide a connection to neurons in the brain parenchyma. The NVU is thought to be the cellular basis for the tight regulation of transport of nutrients, metabolites, and immune cell entry across the BBB and into the brain and central nervous system. \n\nThe luminal surface of endothelial cells is in direct contact with blood and includes a wide variety of transporter proteins that shuttle nutrients and metabolites across the BBB in a tightly-regulated manner via transcytosis [6]. The tight regulation of molecules crossing the BBB represents one of the largest challenges in the treatment of neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, since many therapeutics are not able to enter the brain parenchyma due to their inability to cross the BBB efficiently, including nearly all protein-based drugs such as antibodies. One promising approach to facilitate trafficking of protein therapeutics into the brain is to use a \"carrier\" protein that binds to a transcytosing receptor present on the surface of the endothelial cells, allowing the therapeutic to piggyback on this receptor to gain access into the brain through receptor-mediated transcytosis (RMT) [7][8][9][10].",

            "text": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) which is considered as a tight connection made up from connecting the blood capillaries comprising endothelial cell with the tight junction of pericytes, astrocytes, and basal membrane [115]. Being hardest to cross, the major barrier, i.e., BBB, provides several limitations such as insufficient delivery of the therapeutic agent. Therefore, the number of central nervous system disorder remains untreated or difficult to treat. Moreover, the restriction imposed on the infiltration of the drug molecules' brain barrier allows the entry of only a small molecule having a molecular weight (especially less than 400 Da) or for the lipid-soluble drug [116]. Thus, the scenario created the necessity to develop techniques for crossing the BBB. Several advances have been made to explore the properties of BBB for the effective treatment of brain diseases, like the delivery of drug-using nanocarrier or NPs as noninvasive techniques to enhance brain drug uptake. In the past few decades, syringe injection has been used for the delivery of drugs to the brain. But these approaches are entitled with smoke limitations like serious issues regarding the probability of infection and inflammation at the site of injection together with the occurrence of pain and anxiety, which has drawn attention toward some alternative mode of drug delivery and incompetency toward the patient [117]. Kearney et al. investigated the donepezil hydrochloride (Alzheimer's drug)-loaded MN patch. In brief, MNs are made up of PVP or poly(methyl vinyl ether co-maleic anhydride/acid) polymers. Furthermore, in vitro permeation of donepezil hydrochloride across neonatal porcine skin from the patches was investigated, with 854.71 lg \u00b1 122.71 lg donepezil hydrochloride delivered after 24 h, using patch formulation, signifying the accomplishment of this delivery proposal for donepezil hydrochloride to take care of brain disorder [118]. Another study reported that the silicon-based MNs for drug delivery in the deep brain. In this regard, MN array fabricated on silicon intended for infusion of activity in the brain to recognize connections as well as neuronal activities [119].",

            "text": "In this section, we cover important barriers in the body that are particularly tightly regulated to prevent uninvited guests from entering or to remove them again: the bloodbrain barrier, the placenta barrier between mother and fetus, and the kidney. \n\nUsing 3 different sizes of polystyrene MP particles, 0.2, 2, and 10 \u00b5m, Kwon et al. observed accumulation in microglial cells after oral treatment in mice, demonstrating the ability of MP/NP to cross the blood-brain barrier [41]. The same study reported impaired microglial morphology, immune response, and apoptosis provoked by 0.2 and 2 \u00b5m particle size in human microglial HMC-3 cells, again revealing the size-dependent effects of MP/NP. Both the human cell line and the mouse brain microglia showed activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and apoptotic markers, suggesting severe effects of MP/NP particles on cellular processes in the brain. Similar results were observed using polystyrene nanoparticles with a size of 50 nm [42]. Similar to the results were seen regarding skin permeation, where the capability of particles to cross the blood-brain barrier is also size-dependent, with NP showing a higher penetrance compared to MP [43]. However, exposing mice over 180 days to polystyrene particles of different sizes, Jin et al. observed a concentration-, but not size-dependent neurotoxicological phenotype with hippocampal inflammation accompanied by cognitive and memory deficits [44]. Of note, all used particle sizes (0.5, 4, and 10 \u00b5m) were detected in the brain of exposed mice. \n\nWhen polystyrene MP/NP particles with sizes of 100 nm and 1 \u00b5m were administered orally to female mice during gestational days 1 to 17, Yang and colleagues observed not only the transfer of plastic particles from the maternal mice to the fetus across the placenta but also serious effects on the fetal thalamus, which in turn induced anxiety-like behavior in the progeny [45].",

The treatment of brain diseases is challenging partly due to the inaccessibility of therapeutic agents to the brain. An increasingly important observation is that the physiology of the brain alters during many brain diseases, and aging adds even more to the complexity of the disease. There is a notion that the permeability of the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) increases with aging or disease, however, the body has a defense mechanism that still retains the separation of the brain from harmful chemicals in the blood. This makes drug delivery to the diseased brain, even more challenging and complex task. Here, the physiological changes to the diseased brain and aged brain are covered in the context of drug delivery to the brain using nanoparticles. Also, recent and novel approaches are discussed for the delivery of therapeutic agents to the diseased brain using nanoparticle based or magnetic resonance imaging guided systems. Furthermore, the complement activation, toxicity, and immunogenicity of brain targeting nanoparticles as well as novel in vitro BBB models are discussed.",

Applying a sensitive and specific LC\u2013MS/MS technique for the measurement of BBB integrity with high precision, we have recently introduced non-radioactive [ 13 C 12 ]sucrose as a superior marker substance. Comparison of permeability markers with different molecular weight, but otherwise similar physicochemical properties, can provide insights into the uptake mechanism at the BBB. Mannitol is a small hydrophilic, uncharged molecule that is half the size of sucrose. Previously only radioactive [ 3 H]mannitol or [ 14 C]mannitol has been used to measure BBB integrity. Methods We developed a UPLC\u2013MS/MS method for simultaneous analysis of stable isotope-labeled sucrose and mannitol. The in vivo BBB permeability of [ 13 C 6 ]mannitol and [ 13 C 12 ]sucrose was measured in mice, using [ 13 C 6 ]sucrose as a vascular marker to correct for brain intravascular content. Moreover, a Transwell model with induced pluripotent stem cell-derived brain endothelial cells was used to measure the permeability coefficient of sucrose and mannitol in vitro both under control and compromised (in the presence of IL-1\u03b2) conditions. Results We found low permeability values for both mannitol and sucrose in vitro (permeability coefficients of 4.99\u2009\u00b1\u20090.152\u2009\u00d7\u200910 \u22127 and 3.12\u2009\u00b1\u20090.176\u2009\u00d7\u200910 \u22127 cm/s, respectively) and in vivo (PS products of 0.267\u2009\u00b1\u20090.021 and 0.126\u2009\u00b1\u20090.025\u00a0\u00b5l g \u22121 min \u22121 , respectively). Further, the in vitro permeability of both markers substantially increased in the presence of IL-1\u03b2.

            "text": "Although not the focus of this review, it is noteworthy to mention the existence of other blood-brain/cerebrospinal fluid barriers that are essential for brain homeostasis. The meninges (dura mater, arachnoid mater, and pia mater) comprise the outermost protection of the brain. Moreover, the brain ventricles contain highly vascularized structures, the choroid plexus, composed of fenestrated blood vessels and epithelia sealed by tight junctions. This choroid plexus epithelium comprises the so-called blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier, which establishes a barrier between the blood and the cerebrospinal fluid barrier. These barriers have been extensively reviewed elsewhere [6][7][8]. \n\nThis review will focus on recent findings describing how different pathological states compromise BBB integrity, discuss current potential therapeutic approaches that have been explored for improving BBB integrity and slowing neurodegenerative disease pathologies, and the recent findings in microbial mediated modulation of the BBB. Firstly, it is important to introduce the structure of the BBB to understand how each aspect of normal function can be altered or manipulated, affecting the integrity of the entire system. By putting everything into context by describing the BBB structure, emphasizing how the barrier alters in age and disease, and the current drugs explored to slow the negative outcomes of age and disease through acting directly on the BBB, the goal is to exploit the easily accessible and manipulable microbiota as a potential target to modulate the BBB.",

It also represents the main obstacle in the treatment of many diseases of the central nervous system. Among the different approaches employed to overcome this barrier, the use of nanoparticles as a tool to enhance delivery of therapeutic molecules to the brain is particularly promising. There is special interest in the use of magnetic nanoparticles, as their physical characteristics endow them with additional potentially useful properties. Following systemic administration, a magnetic field applied externally can mediate the capacity of magnetic nanoparticles to permeate the blood-brain barrier. Meanwhile, thermal energy released by magnetic nanoparticles under the influence of radiofrequency radiation can modulate blood-brain barrier integrity, increasing its permeability. In this review, we present the strategies that use magnetic nanoparticles, specifically iron oxide nanoparticles, to enhance drug delivery to the brain.",

Inspired by the neuroprotective properties of vinpocetine, which regulates cerebral blood flow, we propose a molecular library design centered on this class of cyclic tertiary amine compounds and develop a self-enhanced brain-targeted nucleic acid delivery system. Our findings reveal that: (i) vinpocetine-derived ionizable-lipidoid nanoparticles efficiently breach the blood-brain barrier; (ii) they have high gene-loading capacity, facilitating endosomal escape and intracellular transport; (iii) their administration is safe with minimal immunogenicity even with prolonged use; and (iv) they have potent pharmacologic brain-protective activity and may synergize with treatments for brain disorders as demonstrated in male APP/PS1 mice.",

The NK NPs were able to stop the aggregation of amyloid plaques and disrupt the aggregates that were already formed. Our results were in agreement with the previous research, 35 and substantiates the amyloid-degrading ability of NK. It has been reported that NK also has the capacity to decrease A\u03b2 by decreasing fibrin content in the blood and its leakage in the brain, thus indirectly inhibiting plaque formation. 36 Delivery of the drug to the right target has been equally important as the drug's own activity. Because of the stringent nature of the blood-brain barrier, it has been a challenge to target cerebral disease with specific drugs. The blood-brain barrier has been known to prevent the entry of any particle into the brain. Being a hydrophilic protein, NK is unable enter the brain by directly crossing the blood-brain barrier. By encapsulating NK into the PLGA matrix, it was modified in such a way that it gained the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. Combining NPs with Tet1 could be one potential strategy to increase the uptake of NPs by neuronal cells. Previous research has adopted similar strategies to combine PLGA NPs with glycosylated heptapeptide for brain targeting.

            "text": "The central nervous system (CNS) barriers are essential interfaces between the CNS and the periphery. The most selective one is the blood brain barrier (BBB), being mainly composed of endothelial cells connected by tight junctions (TJs) and adherens junctions (AJs) [1]. In some brain pathologies (e.g. brain infections, neurodegenerative disorders, and stroke) the BBB is altered and becomes more permeable allowing the entry of molecules that can induce inflammatory responses and neuronal damage [2].\n\nIn parallel, increasing worldwide lifespan has led to a rise in the prevalence of stroke, Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), having a huge impact in society and the economy [3][4][5]. However, the majority of current available treatments are symptomatic and unable to restore quality of life and halt or ameliorate damage. Until now the search for new therapies remains without significant improvements, and drug deliverypromising new molecules or even rehabilitating old onesis the major challenge to be overcome.\n\nNanoparticles (NPs) are considered one of the most auspicious and versatile drug delivery systems into inaccessible regions like the brain, being able to provide protection to therapeutic agents while efficiently delivering them into the damaged areas. Several NP formulations have been administered intravenously in healthy animals proving their efficacy in crossing the BBB, mainly when they are modified with surfactants or ligands. With this in mind, it is important to understand BBB modifications in pathology in order to take advantage of these traits to develop new and innovative NP formulations capable of successfully targeting damaged areas of the brain.\n\nIn this review, the alterations of the BBB in pathology, namely in stroke, AD and PD, will be reviewed. The principal characteristics of NPs that allow efficient brain delivery as well as targeting of the disease regions for repair will be covered.",

            "text": "Cell therapy, in particular, has shown great therapeutic potential in NDs, due to the capacity of pluripotent or stem cells to promote tissue repair at lesion sites through the restoration of dysfunctional nerve cells and, consequently, to promote endogenous repair, neurorestoration, and neuroprotection mechanisms [8]. However, research on cell therapy for NDs is ongoing, and no definitive cure has yet been developed for any of these diseases. \n\nThe blood-brain barrier (BBB) continues to represent a great challenge for the administration of treatments for NDs. Most therapeutic molecules are unable to cross the barrier to access the central nervous system (CNS) from the bloodstream; therefore, oral and systemic administration of these drugs is ineffective. Some alternatives have been proposed for the delivery of therapeutic molecules across the BBB, but most are only able to achieve low concentrations of these molecules [9]. Direct intracerebral or intrathecal administration to the CNS presents the disadvantage that it can be highly invasive, potentially triggering undesired responses [10]. Therefore, there is a need to develop biocompatible vehicles and unconventional administration routes to establish effective treatments targeting the CNS. \n\nIntranasal administration offers a direct route to the brain, bypassing the BBB and avoiding potential adverse reactions associated with the systemic absorption of drugs. Compared to other administration routes, intranasal administration is non-invasive and highly practical, and may enable larger amounts of the therapeutic molecule to reach the brain [11]. \n\nThis review discusses the advances made in the intranasal administration of cell therapies for each ND. We also address the advances in this field for the treatment of cerebrovascular disease (CVD), which, despite the different etiology from that of NDs, may also benefit from intranasal cell therapy. Finally, we present the potential use of biomaterials to assist in intranasal cell therapy targeting the CNS, a field that, to our knowledge, is as yet unexplored and may offer great therapeutic benefits in the treatment of NDs.",

It may at least partially explain why neurological disorders that continue to cause dramatic disabilities in a one billion people worldwide are so difficult to treat. Over the past four decades some progress has been made in overcoming the presence of the BBB. However, proposed approaches have been limited by a lack of specificity, safety concerns, inability to deliver sufficient drug concentration in the brain tissue, or difficulties in performing protocols. Therefore, the development of non-invasive approaches for brain drug delivery, which can be done in daily clinical practice, remains of critical importance in the treatment of brain disorders.

            "text": "The difficulty in transporting medicines, diagnostic agents, theranostics agents, proteins, nucleic acids, and other macromolecules to the CNS has been restricted by the presence of the BBB and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB). Among the two, the strategies to penetrate the BBB are one of the most important challenges encountered by formulation scientists (Banks, 2016). \n\nTherefore, the current neurotherapeutics has two key drawbacks: they have restricted entry of therapeutics by the rigid BBB, resulting in insufficient entry into the brain, and they have restricted access to immune cells in the brain. Most conventional drug treatments for neurological diseases are created with lipophilic characteristics; however, the molecular weights of such compounds are more than 400-500 Da. Due to these properties, these conventional therapeutic components are restricted to cross the rigid biological barrier of the brain to deliver therapeutically effective concentration to the brain (Howes and Kaar, 2018). On the other hand, the trans-cellular mechanism plays an important role in the penetration of small lipophilic molecules, viz., alcohol and steroid hormones (Curley and Cady, 2018;Banks and Greig, 2019). Similarly, antipsychotic agents are also known to present numerous complications, although the patients undergo normal homeostasis. There might be some mild issues of dry mouth or sedation to extremely disagreeable situations of sexual dysfunction, extrapyramidal symptoms, or constipation; to stressful situations (such as acute dystonias); to traumatizing conditions, including tardive dyskinesia or weight gain; and to potentially lethal conditions due to agranulocytosis or myocarditis (Muench and Hamer, 2010). \n\nThus, the challenges of delivering the therapeutic agents across the BBB to the brain require immediate attention for recovering from the issues by the use of modern platforms of drug delivery and novel routes of administration. Therefore, the present review has been attempted to present the challenges of delivering the therapeutics to the brain using conventional routes of administration and overcoming the issues by the introduction of intranasal routes of administration to deliver the therapeutics circumventing the biological barrier of the brain.",

            "text": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) controls the migration of components from circulating blood to brain tissue. The BBB is formed by several types of cells, including endothelial cells with tight junctions, pericytes, astrocytes with foot processes, and perivascular neurons. Thus, the arterial capillaries in the CNS form a permeability barrier distinct from any other tissue, which harbors endothelial fenestrations between cells. The tight junctions found in the BBB generate high transendothelial electrical resistances of 1,500-2,000 \u2126 cm 2 . As a comparison, in tissues other than brain, the transendothelial electrical resistance ranges from 3-33 \u2126 cm 2 . 78 Thus, the BBB contributes with the essential protection of neural structures preventing cellular damage from extra-cellular insults. \n\nHowever, from the standpoint of the therapeutic development for inherited neurological disorders such as MLD, the BBB represents \"a problem standing before the major problem\". In other words, BBB constitutes the major obstacle to novel therapeutic agents that require reaching the affected neural tissue to treat the neurological manifestations of the disease. Amongst the drugs in the current medicinal chemistry database, only a few -approximately 5%-6% -cross the BBB and are able to produce CNS effects. 79 These are small molecules with high Log P coefficient of lipophilicity, and molecular weight ranging from 400 to 450 D. 79 These drugs include antipsychotics, antidepressants, and hypnotics. 79 The BBB imposes the main obstacle to delivery of several of the novel therapies developed for MLD, including the recombinant enzyme, which is a large molecular weight therapeutic agent (\u223c52 kD). Additionally, certain cells of hematopoietic origin, including macrophages, activated T-cells, and microglial cells, are capable of crossing the BBB and migration to the CNS. 80 Thus, both specific strategies, utilizing small molecules and specific cells, constitute potential novel avenues to deliver CNS disease-modifying agents for MLD patients.",

The blood-brain barrier begins to form in utero and is a carefully regulated gatekeeper that allows nutrients but prevents bacteria and potentially harmful molecules from crossing from the blood to the brain. Capillary endothelial cells connected with tight junctions and joined by the addition of astrocytes and pericytes form the blood-brain barrier over time [66]. This process is incomplete when a preterm infant is born and begins contact with the microbiome, potentially increasing interactions between the developing preterm infant brain and bacteria and bacterial metabolites. Studies have shown that germ-free mice have prolonged increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier associated with decreased expression of the specific tight junction proteins Occludin and Claudin-5 [66]. Other studies have shown that inflammation, associated with increased systemic inflammatory cytokines as seen in NEC, further increases blood-brain barrier permeability [67]. Correspondingly, the probiotics Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium infantis, the same probiotics that have been shown to decrease the incidence of NEC, improve the blood-brain barrier specifically by increasing the tight junction protein Occludin [67]. Thus, the microbiome also has a role in regulating the blood-brain barrier itself.",

            "text": "phins can cause immunogenicity which can manifest in adverse effects including hypersensitivity and anaphylactic shock [12]. In order to overcome these pharmacokinetic issues, neurotrophins have been incorporated in drug delivery systems and neurotrophin mimetics with more favorable pharmacokinetics have been developed. Studies involving the implantation of BDNF polymers in the hippocampi of rats indicated that microspheres released the majority of the encapsulated BDNF within 48 hours [13]. Mimetics, which mimic the BDNF protein, were similarly created in an attempt to circumvent the pharmacokinetic issues [14]. The development of nonpeptide molecules that can activate the TrkB receptor without activating the harmful p75NTR receptor has been the subject of current research. In vitro experiments demonstrate that the molecule LM22A-4, a selective small-molecule partial agonist of TrkB, can trigger the downstream activators of the TrkB receptor [9]. Although these interventions are still in the preclinical stage, their potential to overcome pharmacokinetic challenges may lead to future use in clinical trials. An additional benefit of mimetics is that they may be better able to cross the blood-brain barrier compared to BDNF and NGF.\n\n1.3. Poor Blood-Brain Barrier Permeability. Attempts to use BDNF and NGF as therapeutics for central nervous system (CNS) disorders typically utilize central administration routes that bypass the BBB, including intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection, intraparenchymal injection, and intranasal administration [11]. This is largely due to their severe limitation in crossing the blood-brain barrier; however, challenges related to direct central administration still remain [11]. Intracerebroventricular and intraparenchymal routes of administration are highly invasive. Although intranasal administration is noninvasive, it generally results in lower efficiency of drug delivery to brain tissues as nasal mucosa can inhibit molecule permeability which is compounded by a lack of literature on appropriate nasal delivery [15].

            "text": "As the brain is one of the most important, complex and specialized organs, it has to be extraordinarily protected. It is secured by two main barriers: the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier and the blood-brain barrier [16]. The BBB serves for dynamic transport of nutrients, peptides, proteins and immune cells between the brain and blood [15]. The BBB is formed by the tight junctions between the microvascular endothelial cells of the CNS and it works through a selective permeability system. Paracellular transport between the endothelial cells and transcellular transport (active and passive) through the luminal side of the endothelial cells, across the cytoplasm to the abluminal site of the endothelial cells, and finally to the interstitium of the brain, represent the main pathways for crossing the BBB of small molecules. In order to treat brain disease, the therapeutic has to be able to cross the BBB and at the same time it must not cause immune response [16,89]. The mechanism of a drug delivery across the BBB should ideally be well controlled, selective and not cause any damage to the BBB. The carrier should target the BBB, although the administration is systemic; at the same time, the carrier should be biodegradable and not toxic. The concentration of the drug should reach the therapeutic concentration at the site of action and remain for an appropriate time span to achieve the desired effect [15]. \n\nUse of nanoparticles for delivery to the brain represents a promising approach, since they are small and could therefore cross the BBB and deliver drugs to their action site [5,14]. In association with potential drug delivery to the brain, several different nanomaterials have been studied, including, but not limited to, gold nanoparticles, liposomes, dendrimers, carbon nanotubes, and micelles (Figure 2) [16]. and the blood-brain barrier [16]. The BBB serves for dynamic transport of nutrients, peptides, proteins and immune cells between the brain and blood [15].

            "text": "The restrictions of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), limiting the passage of harmful molecules from the circulation, remains a major obstacle for drug delivery to the brain (Pardridge, 2020) and consequently, demands improved drug delivery strategies (Pardridge, 2012;Terstappen et al., 2021). The BBB is composed of brain endothelial cells (BECs) lining the capillary wall supported by pericytes and astrocytic end-feet (Abbott et al., 2009;Alvarez et al., 2011). It controls the entry of molecules into the brain to maintain a stable microenvironment, crucial for proper neuronal function (Abbott et al., 2009;Alvarez et al., 2011;Armulik et al., 2010;Daneman et al., 2010;Misje et al. 2010). Several different methods have been explored to overcome the hindrance of the BBB, for example, temporarily increasing BBB permeability using hyperosmolar solutes and focused ultrasound, directly infusing compounds into the brain, and exploiting targeting to existing mechanisms for nutrient transport at the BBB. Yet, these efforts are often associated with a risk of serious adverse events, limited distribution within the brain, or low brain specificity, respectively (Assmann et al., 2016;Johnsen & Moos, 2016;Johnsen et al., 2017;McMahon et al., 2019;Tajes et al., 2014). Other strategies used to enhance the BBB crossing includes engineering adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors, for example, AAV-PHP.eB and AAV-PHP.B, but these vectors are not brain permissive in all mouse strains, which limits the translation beyond mouse models (Matsuzaki et al., 2019;Mathiesen et al., 2020). An alternative approach to bypass the restrictive functions of the BBB is gene therapy to the BECs to induce protein synthesis and secretion (Figure 1a) (Burkhart et al., 2017;Chen et al., 2009;Hede et al., 2020;Jiang et al., 2003;Thomsen et al., 2011).",

            "text": "As previously noted, traditional methods for delivering drugs to the brain are invasive and costly, while also threatening patient comfort, sterility, and safety. As a result, their widespread use remains challenging. However, the emergence of nanotechnology-based delivery systems offers new opportunities to overcome these limitations and target drugs more effectively to the CNS [7]. \n\nIn general, colloidal drug carriers, including micelles, NEs, liposomes, and nanoparticles (nanospheres and nanocapsules), aim to increase the specificity toward cells or tissues, to improve the bioavailability of drugs by increasing their diffusion through biological membranes, and/or to protect them against enzymatic inactivation Lipid nanocarriers, in particular, offer several advantages over other nanocarriers, making them highly attractive for brain delivery. These nanodrug delivery systems elicit enhanced oral bioavailability, extended bloodstream half-life, and reduced side effects by modifying intrinsic drug properties such as solubility, bioavailability, diffusivity, drug release profiles, and immunogenicity [26]. These colloidal systems also have higher biocompatibility, biodegradability, and less cytotoxicity as benefits. The usage of physiological lipids and GRAS (generally regarded as safe) excipients is to account for this [82]. Additionally, they can incorporate both lipophilic and hydrophilic medications designed to be delivered to the brain, which can be given through several methods. These systems also allow access across the BBB, given their lipophilic nature and small size, as they can mask the physicochemical characteristics of nontransportable drugs and overcome their low permeability through their encapsulation [7]. \n\nWith the ability to evade phagocytosis by the reticuloendothelial system (RES) and naturally cross the brain capillary endothelial cells, lipid nanocarriers have become a major focus in CNS nanomedicine research.",

Encapsulated genetically engineered cells have been suggested as a means for sustained local delivery of such peptides to the brain. In our experiments, we studied human mesenchymal stem cells which were transfected to produce glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1).MethodsCells were packed in a water-permeable mesh bag containing 400 polymeric microcapsules, each containing 3000 cells. The mesh bags were either transplanted into the subdural space, into the brain parenchyma or into the cerebral ventricles of the cat brain. Mesh bags were explanted after two weeks, and cell viability, as well as GLP-1 concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), was measured.ResultsViability of cells did not significantly differ between the three implantation sites. However, CSF concentration of GLP-1 was significantly elevated only after ventricular transplantation with a maximum concentration of 73 pM (binding constant = 70 pM).ConclusionsThis study showed that ventricular cell-based delivery of soluble factors has the capability to achieve concentrations in the CSF which may become pharmacologically active. Despite the controversy about the pharmacokinetic limitations of ventricular drug delivery, there might be a niche in this for encapsulated cell biodelivery of soluble, highly biologically-effective neuropeptides of low molecular weight like GLP-1.",

            "text": "bioavailability, new strategies are required (Ghersi-Egea et al., 2009).\n\nA growing effort has been applied to overcome these issues and to find novel approaches for the treatment of neurological diseases with RES. Nanotechnology have been suggested as a suitable strategy for RES delivery to enhance its therapeutic activity (Summerlin et al., 2015). Through nanoencapsulation is possible to enhance RES bioavailability by increasing its solubility in water and preventing degradation. Nanoencapsulation will also allow decreasing RES toxicity in healthy tissues (Amri et al., 2012;Arora and Jaglan, 2017). In the last decade, several nanomaterials have been proposed as drug delivery systems (DDSs) (Peres et al., 2012;Khan et al., 2015;Ramalho et al., 2015a,b;Ramalho and Pereira, 2016). Each nanomaterial exhibits different biochemical and physicochemical properties and depending on the drug to be encapsulated and the disease to be treated, the most suitable nanomaterial should be selected based on its characteristics. In addition, biological barriers must be considered during the design and development of the chosen nanocarrier (Blanco et al., 2015).\n\nAmong the existent biological barriers, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is one of the main drawbacks for brain delivery. This barrier consists on a monolayer of capillary endothelial cells that block the path of over 98% of small-molecule drugs and 100% of large-molecule (>500 Da) (Cardoso et al., 2010), protecting the brain microenvironment from toxic substances present in the bloodstream, but allowing the transport of nutrients (Groothuis, 2000;Liebner et al., 2011). Thus, BBB hinders the development of novel therapies for brain disorders (Pardridge, 2009;Loureiro et al., 2014b;Bhowmik et al., 2015).\n\nThe capability of nanosystems to cross the BBB depends on their physicochemical properties, and therefore nanocarriers must meet several requirements as being non-toxic, able to carry the desired drug and able to interact with receptors present at the BBB (",

Recently, \u03b2-cyclodextrin was also proven to be useful for the IN delivery to the mouse brain of allopregnanolone, a steroid with anti-seizure activity, thereby elevating the seizure threshold [114].

Lipid nanocapsules emerge as a versatile platform to tackle those barriers, and efficiently delivery different drug payloads due to their numerous advantages. They can be produced in a fast, solvent-free and scalable-up process, and their properties can be fine-tuned for to make an optimal brain drug delivery vehicle. Moreover, lipid nanocapsule surface modification can further improve their bioavailability towards the central nervous system. Coupling these features with alternative delivery methods that stem to disrupt or fully circumvent the blood-brain barrier may fully harness the therapeutic advance that lipid nanocapsules can supply to current treatment options [54]. Surfactants are also employed to increase brain targeting. Commonly used surfactants like polysorbate 80 (PS 80 or Tween 80) and poloxamer 188 can induce the adsorption of proteins from the bloodstream that interact directly with receptors and transporters on the BBB surface [55].",

            "text": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) poses a formidable opposition to effectively treating many brain diseases because it limits the passage of cells and molecules between the bloodstream and the brain. Successfully overcoming this barrier is essential for delivering pharmacologically active molecules to targeted sites within the central nervous system (CNS). Multiple strategies have been suggested to enhance drug delivery through BBB. These include locally bypassing the barrier with direct injections or nasal applications of drugs and enhancing overall delivery through the bloodstream [1]. \n\nAn emerging frontier in pharmaceutical research entails the development of brain-targeted drug delivery systems, which hold particular significance in addressing CNS disorders while surmounting the formidable BBB. This barrier, primarily constituted of brain microvascular endothelial cells endowed with tight junctions (TJs), poses formidable difficulties to the passage of therapeutic compounds from the systemic circulation into the brain parenchyma [1]. To confront this challenge, innovative strategies such as nanocarrier-based drug delivery systems have been devised, offering the capability to encapsulate drugs and augment their transport across the BBB. Moreover, molecular targeting methodologies employing ligands specifically tailored to receptors expressed on brain endothelial cells present a promising avenue for facilitating enhanced drug penetration into the CNS [1]. These advancements are significant for elevating the therapeutic efficacy and mitigating off-target effects in treating neurological conditions, encompassing neurodegenerative diseases and brain malignancies. Nevertheless, continued research and development endeavors are imperative to refine the design and performance of brain-targeted drug delivery systems, thereby ensuring their safety, efficacy, and translational viability. \n\nA tightly regulated microenvironment is vital for the normal operations of the CNS. A biological membrane at the blood-brain interface effectively separates the brain and the rest of the body. Paul Ehrlich initially discovered this barrier when he observed that a dye injected peripherally failed to stain brain tissue [2]. Subsequent experiments by Ehrlich's colleague, Goldmann, using the same dye in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), further validated this finding by demonstrating selective staining of brain tissue without leakage into the surrounding areas [2].",

            "text": "Because the brain is the most important human organ, many brain disorders can cause severe symptoms. For example, glioma, one type of brain tumor, is progressive and lethal, while neurodegenerative diseases cause severe disability. Nevertheless, medical treatment for brain diseases remains unsatisfactory, and therefore innovative therapies are desired. However, the development of therapies to treat some cerebral diseases is difficult because the blood-brain barrier (BBB) or blood-brain tumor barrier prevents drugs from entering the brain. Hence, drug delivery system (DDS) strategies are required to deliver therapeutic agents to the brain. Recently, brain-targeted DDS have been developed, which increases the quality of therapy for cerebral disorders. This review gives an overview of recent brain-targeting DDS strategies. First, it describes strategies to cross the BBB. This includes BBB-crossing ligand modification or temporal BBB permeabilization. Strategies to avoid the BBB using local administration are also summarized. Intrabrain drug distribution is a crucial factor that directly determines the therapeutic effect, and thus it is important to evaluate drug distribution using optimal methods. We introduce some methods for evaluating drug distribution in the brain. Finally, applications of brain-targeted DDS for the treatment of brain tumors, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and stroke are explained.",

Neuropeptides and many drugs which are hydrophilic in nature possibly will encompass the intricacy while passing the blood brain barrier.

We note briefly here the existence of the two other \"high\" barriers: the blood-testis barrier [101,102], and the blood-placenta barrier [73,[103][104][105][106][107][108]. It is interesting to compare the strikingly different structural embodiments of these three \"high\" barriers: the blood-brain barrier resides in the microvascular endothelium of the cerebral circulation, the bloodtestis barrier resides in the Sertoli (epithelial) cells of the testis, and the blood-placenta barrier resides in the syncytial trophoblast. Each of these barriers therefore bases on a different morphological substrate: an endothelium, an epithelium, and a syncytium. This illustrates the great variety of blood-tissue barrier constructions that are possible, and a wide variety of constructions is also likely to be found amongst the \"lower\" or \"less high\" barriers found in other organs. between the blood and the central nervous tissue. Nanoparticles (NP, green stars) applied in the blood could cross the endothelial layer (En) and the subendothelial basement membrane (BM), and pass through the gaps between two astroglial endfeet (interstitium).

            "text": "With the development of an aging population, the incidence of central nervous system (CNS) diseases including ALzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, stroke, and brain tumors is increasing and has become the second most common type of disease threatening human life. These diseases are caused by a variety of complex ischemic, hemorrhagic, inflammatory, neurodegenerative, and developmental disorders, which are prevalent and poorly treated. However, the success of CNS drug development is very low, and one of the most important constraints is the difficulty of crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Almost all large-molecule drugs, including peptides, recombinant proteins, monoclonal antibodies, and drugs based on RNA interference technology, and more than 98% of smallmolecule drugs fail to cross the blood-brain barrier, which seriously hinders the effective clinical treatment of CNS diseases. 33 Therefore, CNS drugs need to be able to overcome the BBB and achieve adequate exposure in the CNS while having safety and efficacy, which is the key to successful CNS drug development. The brain barrier is a key factor affecting the efficacy of central nervous system drugs, so increasing drug distribution to the brain could improve efficacy for possible new approaches to the treatment of refractory depression. \n\nIn order to achieve drug delivery across the BBB, existing research mainly focuses on directly interfering with the physiological barrier function of the BBB to reduce the obstruction of the blood-brain barrier, such as opening tight junctions 34 and inhibiting efflux pumps; 35 or rationally designing and modifying drug molecules 36 to change the properties of drugs to make them cross the BBB more easily, such as designing drugs by simulating endogenous molecules, pre-drug design, lipidation modification, glycosylation modification; and also coupling drugs with carriers to build effective brain drug delivery systems, such as monoclonal antibody delivery systems and cell shuttle peptide delivery systems. In addition, the use of appropriate routes of drug delivery, including nasal administration and intrathecal injection, has improved the success rate of crossing the BBB.",

Therefore, we investigated oral delivery of green fluorescence protein (GFP) or myelin basic protein (MBP) fused with the transmucosal carrier cholera toxin B subunit (CTB), expressed in chloroplasts (bioencapsulated within plant cells) to the brain and retinae of triple transgenic Alzheimer's disease (3\u00d7TgAD) mice, across the blood-brain barriers (BBB) and blood-retinal barriers (BRB). Human neuroblastoma cells internalized GFP when incubated with CTB-GFP but not with GFP alone. Oral delivery of CTB-MBP in healthy and 3\u00d7TgAD mice shows increased MBP levels in different regions of the brain, crossing intact BBB. Thioflavin S-stained amyloid plaque intensity was reduced up to 60% by CTB-MBP incubation with human AD and 3\u00d7TgAD mice brain sections ex vivo. Amyloid loads were reduced in vivo by 70% in hippocampus and cortex brain regions of 3\u00d7TgAD mice fed with bioencapsulated CTB-MBP, along with reduction in the ratio of insoluble amyloid \u03b2 42 (A\u03b242) to soluble fractions. CTB-MBP oral delivery reduced A\u03b242 accumulation in retinae and prevented loss of retinal ganglion cells in 3\u00d7TgAD mice. Lyophilization of leaves increased CTB-MBP concentration by 17-fold and stabilized it during long-term storage in capsules, facilitating low-cost oral delivery of therapeutic proteins across the BBB and BRB.",

            "text": "Drug delivery technologies such as liquid, semi-solid or particulate formulations are important to deliver pharmaceutical compounds safely to their desired site of therapeutic activity [1]. A highly critical point in drug delivery is the low availability of drugs in the central nervous system (CNS) due to the blood-brain barrier. This barrier prevents 95% of molecules from entering the CNS by numerous tight junctions and efflux transporters [2]. Though, the blood-brain barrier is more permeable for small lipophilic molecules and provides some specific transporters, it limits severely therapies for CNS diseases [3,4]. \n\nThe current state-of-the-art to deliver drugs with a low central bioavailability is intrathecal, intracerebroventricular or intraparenchymal injections that deliver directly to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of the CNS. A chronic drug supply can be provided by implanted medical devices. Although, such techniques are in clinical use, these routes of administration are invasive and their use is predominantly limited to intensive care as the risk of infections is not neglectable [5][6][7][8][9].

Vascular pathological disorders and other chronic neuropathological disorders can be observed. The infection risk, catheter obstruction, and trauma situations are other possible complications. 17 4.2. Noninvasive Techniques. For noninvasive treatment methods, where patient compliance is higher than invasive techniques, there are strategies based on increasing the passage through the blood\u2212brain barrier with lipid-mediated transport mechanisms, the use of alternative administration routes, and the use of nanosized drug delivery systems. There are several strategies based on increasing lipid-mediated transport mechanisms and crossing the blood\u2212brain barrier which include chemical modification with various functional groups and the pro-drug approach. 44 he basic principle in chemical modification is to increase the lipophilicity of the drug molecule. In case of drugs with hydrophilic character, the modification is achieved by adding a functional group that increases the lipophilic character of the drug, so that the low level of passage through the blood\u2212brain barrier can be increased. In the pro-drug approach, the inactive form of the original molecule is metabolized in the brain parenchyma as it passes through the blood\u2212brain barrier. A bioactivation step is needed in the pro-drug approach. 47 While evaluating the effectiveness of these treatment strategies, the increased sensitivity to oxidation due to the increased lipophilic character of the drug, its distribution to other tissues, and the need for a metabolic bioactivation step in the pro-drug approach must be taken into consideration. 47,48 Due to the unique physiological characteristics of the brain, studies have been carried out on alternative administration routes to achieve the desired treatment outcomes.",

In recent years, changes in the gut microbiota composition have been reported as a part of the pathology in numerous neurodegenerative diseases. Bacterial extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been suggested as a novel mechanism for the crosstalk between the brain and gut microbiota, physiologically connecting the observed changes in the brain to gut microbiota dysbiosis. Methods Publications reporting findings on bacterial EVs passage through the blood\u2013brain barrier were identified in PubMed and Scopus databases. Results The literature search yielded 138 non-duplicate publications, from which 113 records were excluded in title and abstract screening step. From 25 publications subjected to full-text screening, 8 were excluded. The resulting 17 publications were considered for the review. Discussion Bacterial EVs have been described with capability to cross the blood\u2013brain barrier, but the mechanisms behind the crossing remain largely unknown. Importantly, very little data exists in this context on EVs secreted by the human gut microbiota. This systematic review summarizes the present evidence of bacterial EVs crossing the blood\u2013brain barrier and highlights the importance of future research on gut microbiota-derived EVs in the context of gut-brain communication across the blood\u2013brain barrier.",

            "text": "The central nervous system (CNS) is one of the most in-demand areas for the development of new therapeutics owing to the increasing occurrence rate of neurodegenerative disorders. However, it remains the most difficult area for drug development because of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which prevents most of the currently developed drugs from entering the brain parenchyma. The BBB functions as a tight barrier to protect the CNS from potential neurotoxic substances, and regulates the selective transport of specific molecules and nutrients to maintain CNS homeostasis. Water molecules and small ions cross brain capillaries through channels, and small molecules under 500 Da can cross the BBB via passive diffusion [1]. However, macromolecules require specific receptors or transport proteins to facilitate receptor-or adsorptive-mediated transport for entry into the brain parenchyma. The increasing need for new therapeutics for CNS diseases has prompted the investigation of various endogenous transportation mechanisms that can deliver macromolecules across the BBB. The development of novel therapeutics utilizing these transportation pathways has been actively validated in numerous preclinical and clinical studies. \n\nAmong the novel therapeutics, exosomes have recently gained attention because of their role as therapeutic vehicles for delivering various active pharmaceutical ingredients Pharmaceutics 2022, 14, 672 2 of 14 to the brain. Exosomes, or small extracellular vesicles (EVs), are a subtype of EVs defined as single-membrane lipid bilayer vesicles generated by vesicle budding into endosomes that mature into multivesicular bodies or by direct vesicle budding from the plasma membrane [2]. Different subtypes of EVs have been identified based on their size and density, which allows separation by methods such as tangential flow filtration, size exclusion chromatography, and differential centrifugation [3]. Nevertheless, careful interpretation is necessary when analyzing different groups of EVs because most EV purification methods cannot determine EVs based on their biogenesis pathways, but rather isolate subtypes of EVs based on their physical properties.",

It is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease over the past decades. The disease's etiology is still uncertain however few aspects which are considered to be crucial in its pathogenesis comprise reduced acetylcholine levels, abnormal proteins and their unwanted buildup and oxidative stress [2]. The presence of blood brain barrier (BBB) is one of the main factors that hampers the drug development and discovery of new compounds in the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's as it hinders the drug delivery to brain [3]. To attain efficacious AD treatment, the blood-brain barrier's (BBB) role has to be considered. It is a specific biochemical, structural and physiological barrier [4]. It only allows specific molecules transport that is vital for the function of brain. Almost 100% of large and more than 98% of small drug molecules are precluded from brain drug delivery [5]. Owing to these factors CNS is one of the most complex microenvironments of the body. Drug delivery system (DDS) shows promise in the treatment of CNS diseases because it displays numerous benefits such as drug delivery to a specific site, protection of drug from clearance by immune and circulatory systems, changing the physicochemical characteristics of drugs, reduction of doses and control of drug release [6][7][8]. They make DDS an attractive option for treating AD. \n\nThe current interest in the development brain drug delivery has resulted in the advancement of numerous colloidal systems such as dendrimers, [9] solid lipid nanoparticles, [10] polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) [11] and liposomes [12]. Amongst the several delivery systems used polymeric NPs have shown promise owing to their potential in opening tight junctions (Tj) of BBB, they efficiently prolong the release of drug and protect against enzymatic-mediated degradation.",

            "text": "The human brain is protected by the complex and selective blood-brain barrier (BBB), which prevents the entry of most small-molecule drugs and almost all large-molecule therapeutic drugs, thereby, posing a major obstacle to intracerebral drug delivery [112]. However, studies have shown that exosomes derived from various brain cell types (brain endothelial cells [113], microglia [114], astrocytes [115], and choroid plexus epithelial cells [116]) and those originating from metastatic brain tumor [117] can target the brain to varying extents. Designing engineered exosomes with surface-modified targeting peptides represents an effective strategy for achieving brain targeting [118]. For instance, Qu et al., achieved brain-targeted delivery of dopamine by saturating blood exosomes with the drug and subsequently transferring the exosomes into a mouse model of Parkinson's disease. Since transferrin is abundantly expressed on blood-derived exosomes, these exosomes, via interaction between transferrin and transferrin receptors, transported the drug across the BBB, leading to a greater than 15-fold increase in brain distribution of dopamine and better therapeutic efficacy [50]. Meanwhile, Gao et al., loaded berberine into exosomes by sonication, and found, by in vivo and tissue imaging, that these exosomes exhibited positive targeting towards the brain and spinal cord, potentially improving their antiinflammatory effect by first crossing the BBB to enter the brain in vivo, and then circulating through cerebrospinal fluid to the site of spinal cord injury [119].",

            "text": "Treating neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease remains an ongoing challenge due to the protective blood-brain barrier (BBB), which prevents most therapeutic agents from crossing into the brain. To overcome this challenge, innovative lipid-based nanoparticles and polymeric scaffolds are being explored as potential solutions for targeted drug delivery to the brain [126][127][128]. These delivery systems are designed to cross the BBB either by exploiting specific transport mechanisms or by modifying their surface properties to enhance permeability. Lipid nanoparticles, such as solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) or liposomes, have shown promise in delivering neuroprotective agents such as antioxidants, neurotrophic factors, and anti-inflammatory drugs directly to the brain [129][130][131]. These systems can also be engineered to release their payloads in a controlled manner, which improves drug efficacy and minimizes side effects. Research has also focused on the development of polymeric nanoparticles and nanogels that can encapsulate multiple therapeutic agents and release them in a targeted, sustained manner, ensuring that higher concentrations of the drug reach the intended site of action within the brain [132,133]. Advances in polymeric scaffolds have enabled the development of biomaterials that can not only carry drugs to the brain but also serve as structural support for damaged tissues, aiding in neuroregeneration [134,135]. For example, hydrogel-based systems have been developed to deliver nerve growth factors to promote the regeneration of neurons in conditions such as Parkinson's disease [136][137][138]. These systems are designed to interact with specific regions of the brain that are affected by disease, improving the delivery of therapeutic agents and providing more personalized, effective treatment options. Moreover, strategies such as nanoparticle-functionalized antibodies and aptamers are being investigated to enhance targeting specificity, ensuring that drugs reach only the affected areas, thereby minimizing off-target effects [139,140].",

This core is composed of an organogel of solid and liquid lipids, such as sorbitan monostearate (SM) and caprylic/capric triglyceride (CCT). The lipid-core is surrounded by a biodegradable polyester, such as poly(\uf065-caprolactone) (PCL). These nanocapsules are stabilized in water by polysorbate 80 (P80) micelles, forming a hydrophilic corona [19]. This innovative and complex supramolecular structure increases the drug loading capacity to over 40 times compared tonanocapsules containing an oil-core [20]. LNCs show controlled and sustained drug release, which diffusional barriers are related to the viscosity of the organogel and the polymer wall [21]. A liquid formulation of resveratrol-loaded LNC improved the antiinflammatory effect of resveratrol after oral administration toa murine model of lipopolysaccharideinduced acute respiratory distress syndrome [22]. Furthermore, acetyl eugenol-loaded LNC (or blank-LNCs) reduced the melanoma volume after daily oral to mouse, which effectivity was explained by SK-Mel-28 cellular uptake as visualized in vitro by CytoViva \u00ae microscopy images [23]. Furthermore, trans-resveratrolloaded LNC showed drug brain targeting after oral administration to healthy male Wistar rats [24]. In addition, intravital microscopy analysis demonstrated that LNC can cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) since the fluorescence in the brain tissue of mice increased after oral administration of fluorescent-labeled LNC (prepared with dye-polymer conjugate) [25]. This study also demonstrated that indomethacin-loaded LNCs can cross the intestinal barrier, they are absorbed, distributed and, then, they target glioblastoma in brain tissue decreasing the tumor size after oral administration [25]. We developed LNC formulations, and we have been studying their pharmacological applications.",

            "text": "In parallel, for those drug candidates that are not capable of successfully crossing the blood-CNS barriers, there is the possibility of transvascular delivery to the brain. It has been demonstrated that the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp) can actively transport lipophilic drugs out of the capillary endothelial cells in brain, leading to minimizing or avoiding neurotoxic adverse effects of drugs. However, efflux transporters may also limit the central distribution of drugs that are beneficial to treat CNS diseases. Therefore, modulation of efflux transporters at the BBB can be considered as a novel strategy to enhance the penetration of drugs into the brain, especially for drug-resistant CNS diseases (10,11). \n\nAn alternative way for drug delivery to the brain is to use delivery systems that facilitate the movement of drug candidate across the blood-CNS barrier (8,9,12). Polymeric micelles are one of the promising nanomedicine-based technologies which have been evaluated as nanocarriers for anticancer drugs (13)(14)(15)(16)(17)(18). Polymeric micelles are kinetically stable nanoparticles with a core-shell structure which are made from amphiphilic block copolymers with hydrophilic and hydrophobic chains that self-assemble in water above the critical micelle concentration. The hydrophobic core of these nano-carriers could serve as a microenvironment for solubilizing poorly water soluble drugs through hydrophobic interaction and/or hydrogen bonding and protect the enclosed compounds from inactivation in biological media, while exposing their hydrophilic shells to the external environment (9, 13). In addition, these systems exhibit many advantages, among which small particle size (less than 100 nm), targeting ability, ease of preparation and prolonged circulation time (the ability to escape from renal exclusion and reticuloendothelial system) could be mentioned (9,13,(19)(20)(21)(22)(23)(24).",

            "text": "The human Blood Brain Barrier (hBBB) is a complex cellular architecture separating the blood from the brain parenchyma. Its integrity and perfect functionality are essential for preventing neurotoxic plasma components and pathogens enter the brain. Although vital for preserving the correct brain activity, the low permeability of hBBB represents a huge impediment to treat mental and neurological disorders or to address brain tumors. Indeed, the vast majority of potential drug treatments are unable to reach the brain crossing the hBBB. On the other hand, hBBB integrity can be damaged or its permeability increase as a result of infections or in presence of neurodegenerative diseases. Current in vitro systems and in vivo animal models used to study the molecular/drug transport mechanism through the hBBB have several intrinsic limitations that are difficult to overcome. In this scenario, Organ-on-Chip (OoC) models based on microfluidic technologies are considered promising innovative platforms that combine the handiness of an in vitro model with the complexity of a living organ, while reducing time and costs. In this review, we focus on recent advances in OoCs for developing hBBB models, with the aim of providing the reader with a critical overview of the main guidelines to design and manufacture a hBBB-on-chip, whose compartments need to mimic the \u2018blood side\u2019 and \u2018brain side\u2019 of the barrier, to choose the cells types that are both representative and convenient, and to adequately evaluate the barrier integrity, stability, and functionality.",

            "text": "The management of brain diseases remains a challenge, particularly because of the difficulty for drugs to cross the blood\u2013brain barrier. Among strategies developed to improve drug delivery, nano-sized emulsions (i.e., nanoemulsions), employed as nanocarriers, have been described. Moreover, focused ultrasound-mediated blood\u2013brain barrier disruption using microbubbles is an attractive method to overcome this barrier, showing promising results in clinical trials. Therefore, nanoemulsions combined with this technology represent a real opportunity to bypass the constraints imposed by the blood\u2013brain barrier and improve the treatment of brain diseases. In this work, a stable freeze-dried emulsion of perfluorooctyl bromide nanodroplets stabilized with home-made fluorinated surfactants able to carry hydrophobic agents is developed. This formulation is biocompatible and droplets composing the emulsion are internalized in multiple cell lines. After intravenous administration in mice, droplets are eliminated from the bloodstream in 24 h (blood half-life (t1/2) = 3.11 h) and no long-term toxicity is expected since they are completely excreted from mice\u2019 bodies after 72 h. In addition, intracerebral accumulation of tagged droplets is safely and significantly increased after focused ultrasound-mediated blood\u2013brain barrier disruption. Thus, the proposed nanoemulsion appears as a promising nanocarrier for a successful focused ultrasound-mediated brain delivery of hydrophobic agents.",

            "text": "Neurodegradative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease are incurable and debilitating conditions. Although various therapeutic strategies have been introduced to modulate neurodegenerative diseases, current therapies are limited because of the poor permeability of drugs through the blood-brain barrier. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop effective therapeutic strategies to deliver drugs to the central nervous system [175,176]. Blood-brain barrier penetration strategies, such as adsorptive and receptor/transporter-mediated transcytosis and targeting specific domains within brain tissues, can enhance the delivery efficiency of NFs to brain lesions. With the development of brain-targeted drug delivery systems, NFs can interact with target cells and tissues in the brain to induce the preferred physiological response while lowering harmful side effects. \n\nInduction of neurogenesis, which is a process of generating new neurons, can be a potential target for treating neurodegradative diseases [177]. Curcumin, a natural polyphenol compound derived from the rhizome of the Indian spice turmeric, has neuroprotective and antioxidant effects through activation of the transcription factor Nrf2, promotion of neurite outgrowth, and proliferation of neural stem cells via activation of the ERK and MAP kinase pathways [178][179][180]. Recently, researchers reported curcumin-encapsulated biodegradable poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles that can induce neural stem cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation by neurogenesis [181]. Curcumin-loaded nanoparticles were developed by encapsulating curcumin in PLGA nanoparticles using the emulsion method. The nanoparticles have a mean diameter of 200 \u00b1 20 nm and entrapment efficiency of 77%, leading to the increased water solubility of curcumin. Moreover, these nanoparticles increased neuronal differentiation by activating the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway and reversed learning and memory impairments in an amyloid beta-induced rat model with AD-like phenotypes compared to free curcumin.",

            "text": "The blood-brain barrier has been defined as a mechanism, unique to central nervous system (CNS), for exchange of substances between plasma and intercellular fluid. This barrier is generally believed to consist of the selectively permeable layer of eNS capillary endothelium (Ti~ mira, 'et a1. 1968;Crone and Thompson 1970). However, a number of tissue layers other than the capillary endothelium have been proposed as the site of the blood-brain barrier (Wilson 1968). The exchange processes across the blood-brain barrier have been discussed by Woodbury (1965). \n\nThe rate of growth of mammalian brain is most rapid before birth; but, in species like rats, rabbits and mice which are born in an immature state, myelination of the brain begins a week or two after birth (Widdowson 1968). \n\nEntry of many drugs into the fluid environment of CNS cells is significantly restricted by their failure to penetrate the blood-brain barrier. Passage of substances through the blood-brain barrier depends on their physicochemical properties. According to Ariens et a1. (1964), the blood-brain barrier appears to behave as a lipid membrane. Therefore, a lipid-insoluble substance will pass the barrier with difficulty, but a lipid-soluble drug will reach the same free concentration on both sides of the barrier. However, the blood-brain barrier represents a unique example of unequal distribution of drugs (Brodie and Hogben 1957). Even if injected intravenously, many drugs fail to penetrate into the CNS (Goth 1970). The blood-brain relationship for each and every substance is different (Dobbing 1961). \n\nSulfonamides are believed to penetrate the blood-brain barrier in variable degrees (G 0 Ids wo rt h y et a1. 1954). Physico-chemical properties of sulfonamides especially of lipid-solubility, protein binding, molecular configuration and acidic properties have been reported to bear an important relationship to the permeability of these compounds through the blood-brain barrier (Goth 1970;Oldendorf 1974).",

            "text": "The BBB controls the entry of nutrients from the vascular system into the extracellular fluid of the central nervous system (CNS) and limits the passage of harmful exogenous molecules to maintain homeostasis, which severely limits the therapeutic efficacy of drugs against CNS diseases including AD [66]. Advantageously, MSC-EVs, which contain small-molecule nucleic acids, proteins, and other cell growth regulators, can penetrate the BBB to exert therapeutic effects in the brain and have therefore been adopted in a wide range of studies on different diseases, such as AD (Table 3) [67][68][69][70][71]. \n\nOne of the most remarkable characteristics of MSC-EVs is their capacity to circulate in the bloodstream and cross the BBB. Although it is unclear how natural MSC-EVs cross the BBB, researchers have found that MSCs crossed the brain microvascular endothelial cell (BMEC) monolayers through transient intercellular gaps formed between BMECs [72]. Transmigration of MSCs across the endothelium in peripheral tissues is mediated by integrin-mediated adhesion or matrix metalloproteinase-dependent extracellular matrix degradation [73,74]. Because the membrane of EVs derived from MSCs shares similar features with MSCs, these findings may offer clues for further investigation into the exact mechanism underlying BBB penetration by MSC-EVs. Moreover, as BMECs cannot represent the function of the complete BBB, a quantitative and qualitative method is needed for monitoring MSC-EV delivery in vivo to the brain [75]. \n\nApart from the traditional intravenous (IV) delivery strategy, nasal delivery has also been studied as a non-invasive method to send MSC-EVs directly to the brain [58,76], and the olfactory mucosa pathway in the olfactory region is the most essential route to the brain [77]. Intranasal administration of PKH-26 labelled MSC-EVs mainly reached neurons, compared with microglia and astrocytes [78], while another study observed a higher absorption by microglia and neurons in the hippocampus but not by astrocytes [58].",

CXCR5 is frequently expressed on B-cell lymphoma, allowing for targeted delivery of the nanocapsulated antibody to CXCR5-expressing lymphoma cells. This resulted in increased levels of the drug in the CNS and control of metastases in the mice. This system could serve as a model for delivering therapeutics with limited CNS penetration [121]. \n\nA challenge in the treatment of infections of the CNS is poor penetration of the bloodbrain barrier (BBB). Modification of the polymer shell to contain abundant choline and acetylcholine analogues has been shown to deliver macromolecules to the CNS with >10-fold higher levels compared to native forms. This modification was utilised in treatment of HIV infection in the CNS of rhesus macaques. IgG1 antibody PGT121 was encapsulated via in situ polymerization of MPC as a monomer, Poly(DL-lactide)-b-Poly(ethylene glycol)-b-Poly(DL-lactide)-diacrylate triblock (A102, PLA-PEG-PLA) as a hydrolysable crosslinker, and GDMA as a degradable crosslinker. Effective transport of the nanocapsule-antibody across the BBB and into the CNS was observed [122].",

Polyanhydride NPs are ideal drug carriers because they are biodegradable, and their rate of encapsulated payload release can be tailored to the desired experimental design [28][29][30]. \n\nThe extent of BBB penetration by MPO-encapsulated polyanhydride NPs has been investigated in vitro. It was discovered that MPO-NP is internalized by human brain epithelial cells, a critical component of the BBB [31]. MPO-NP has not been investigated in vivo. In this study, we tested the efficacy of MPO-encapsulated NPs based on a 20:80 copolymer of 1,6-bis(p-carboxyphenoxy) hexane (CPH) and sebacic anhydride (SA) in an 8-day rat model of DFP-induced epileptogenesis. DFP exposure or seizures disrupt the BBB's selective permeability [32]. Therefore, we compared the serum and hippocampal concentrations of MPO-NP (4 mg, i.m., every 2 days) and non-encapsulated MPO-oral (30 mg/kg, daily) dosing after exposing the rats to DFP. We hypothesized that following DFP exposure, NOX inhibition by MPO-NP or MPO-oral would reduce the markers of neurodegeneration and reactive microgliosis and astrogliosis in the hippocampus, amygdala, and piriform cortex.",

            "text": "Alvarez-Erviti et al. found that DC-derived exosomes can deliver siRNA to the brain of mice and inferred that drugs or siRNA loaded with exosomes can pass through the BBB. They first transduced DC to express the exosome membrane protein LAMP2B, which can be fused with neuron-specific RVG peptides [41]. The purified DC exosomes contained exogenous siRNA targeting BACE1, a crucial regulatory gene in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease; these exosomes were injected intravenously into mice [42]. These exosomes specifically enter the neurons, microglia, and oligodendrocytes in the brain, leading to the knockdown of the BACE1 gene in the mouse model. This study proves the feasibility of specific systemic delivery of exosomes. More importantly, the study shows that exosomes can pass through biological barriers, indicating the possibility of RNAibased treatment of new brain tumors and brain metastases [41][42][43]. \n\nInjecting MSC-derived exosomes secreted into TBI rats intravenously observed that the exosomes secreted by MSCs could reduce the activation of astrocytes and microglia in the brain of TBI rats. Which represents the ability to inhibit inflammation and promote the recovery of nerve function [43]. A significant obstacle in treating neuroinflammatory diseases is no effective carrier to transport drugs across the blood-brain barrier. Exosomes can become ideal drug delivery vehicles of neuroinflammatory illnesses due to low immunity, innate stability, high delivery efficiency, and crossing the blood-brain barrier. The research results show that encapsulating curcumin into exosomes can increase curcumin's solubility, stability, and bioavailability compared with curcumin encapsulated in liposomes alone [44]. \n\nZhang's research showed exosome-encapsulated curcumin intranasally to interfere with lipopolysaccharide-induced rat brain inflammation model and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoproteininduced rat experimental autoimmune brain inflammation.",

However, few nanocarriers can enter the brain via a systemic route through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to efficiently reach neurons. Here we prepare a self-assembled supramolecular nanocarrier with a surface featuring properly configured glucose. The BBB crossing and brain accumulation of this nanocarrier are boosted by the rapid glycaemic increase after fasting and by the putative phenomenon of the highly expressed glucose transporter-1 (GLUT1) in brain capillary endothelial cells migrating from the luminal to the abluminal plasma membrane. The precisely controlled glucose density on the surface of the nanocarrier enables the regulation of its distribution within the brain, and thus is successfully optimized to increase the number of nanocarriers accumulating in neurons. There are only a few examples of nanocarriers that can transport bioactive substances across the blood-brain barrier. Here the authors show that by rapid glycaemic increase the accumulation of a glucosylated nanocarrier in the brain can be controlled.",

Similarly, an in vitro BBB model was used to provide visual evidence that EVs are internalised by brain endothelial cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis and subsequently trafficked across the cell layer, suggesting that EVs utilise active transcytosis rather than passive diffusion [83]. \n\nIn addition to crossing the BBB, EVs have also been observed to traverse mucosal membranes. It was reported that intranasally administered EVs loaded with anti-inflammatory compounds efficiently reached the brain, likely bypassing the mucosal barrier via the olfactory and trigeminal nerve pathways [84].",

            "text": "The blood-brain barrier restricts the exchange of substances (e.g., nutrients, drugs, and poison) between the blood vessels of the brain and brain cells, and helps maintain the optimal environment for nerve function. Therefore, nutrients necessary for nerve activity in the brain (e.g., glucose and amino acids) are selectively transported, and unnecessary substances produced in the brain are excreted into the blood to maintain brain homeostasis. The blood-brain barrier is composed of brain microvascular endothelial cells, astrocytes, and pericytes. Diffusion between cells is limited by the adhesion of the brain microvascular endothelial cells to each other on the blood side [1] (Figure 1). As a result, substances must pass through the endothelial cells in order to be transferred from the circulating blood to the brain. Although highly water-soluble substances have difficulty crossing the blood-brain barrier, nutrients (e.g., glucose, amino acids, peptides, and nucleotides) selectively cross this barrier using various solute-carrier transporters (SLC transporters) that are expressed in the brain microvascular endothelial cells. In addition, ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC transporters), which are also present in the brain microvascular endothelial cells, prevent the accumulation of a poison or drug in the brain by effluxing those that enter the brain back into the blood. Therefore, transporters present in the blood-brain barrier serve as gatekeepers that selectively restrict the transport of substances into the brain.

            "text": "The recent focus of research on alternative routes to improve drug targeting for the management of central nervous system (CNS) disorders has become essential, due to the unsatisfactory results of other routes, such as the parenteral and oral. In this context, the nose-to-brain route emerges as a promising alternative that allows drug passage directly from the nose to the brain, avoiding the need to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) 1 . The latter is a complex barrier formed by tightly connected endothelial capillary cells, pericytes, astroglia and perivascular mast cells, which protects the brain from pathogens and xenobiotics and prevents the passage of about 98% of the molecules, from the blood to the brain 2e4 . Lipophilic and low molecular weight molecules are the only molecules that can easily cross BBB endothelial cells 5,6 . According to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), more than 90% of new drugs used to treat CNS diseases have not been approved due to the difficulty of crossing the BBB 7 . Besides, the CNS has other barriers, including the blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the blood-spinal cord and the blood-retinal barrier 8,9 . Thereby, the intranasal route was suggested as a promising approach to improve the delivery of drugs to the CNS avoiding the need to cross the BBB. This route has shown several advantages, including high drug bioavailability, noninvasiveness, high blood flow, large surface area available for drug absorption, easiness of application, rapid onset of action, avoidance of gastrointestinal and hepatic metabolism and, as mentioned, possibility to circumvent the BBB 10e12 . However, several factors can limit the maintenance of the drug in the nasal mucosa and must be considered when developing an intranasal formulation 10 , including short residence time (15e30 min) due to the mucociliary clearance mechanism, low drug permeability in the nasal mucosa, small volume available for administration (up to 200 mL per nostril), and enzymatic degradation. Furthermore, intranasal formulations should have physiological tonicity, adequate viscosity and pH compatible with",

            "text": "The term \"central nervous system (CNS) diseases\" refers to a broad variety of illnesses, from mild neurological impairments that can manifest as motor, cognitive, visual, linguistic, or cognitive problems alone or in combination with comas and brain death [1,2]. These days, one in six people around the world show signs of having a central nervous system disorder [3,4]. Central nervous system diseases including multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's all have high societal healthcare expenditures [5,6]. Despite extensive research, diagnosing and treating CNS diseases remains a clinical challenge [7]. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a specialized microvasculature in the brain that prevents harmful substances from crossing over into the central nervous system (CNS) when it is in a normal state [8,9]. Drug transport to the CNS, however, hampered various factors such as enzymatic breakdown, the blood-brain barrier, limited circulation lifetimes, and low tissue penetration. To effectively treat CNS diseases, it is necessary to overcome the BBB's sieving out of a large proportion of medicines [10]. \n\nConsequently, solving these issues has emerged as one of the greatest obstacles in treating brain diseases [11]. Possible solutions include using nanotechnology for controlled medication delivery, imaging, and gene editing, all of which are aided by biological, physical, and chemical alteration tactics [12,13]. The nanoparticle is an effective tool for maximizing distribution efficiency, heightening therapeutic benefit, and decreasing unintended consequences. Intravenous, intranasal, and local injections, such as those administered intracranially, are all being explored as potential delivery mechanisms for the nanoplatform being developed for the diagnosis and treatment of brain diseases [14]. Because of their ability to transport bioactive molecules like proteins and encoding and non-coding RNAs between cells and organs, extracellular vesicles play a crucial role in cellular signaling [15].",

            "text": "Judit P. Vigh The blood-brain barrier (BBB) acts as a selective semipermeable barrier separating the central nervous system (CNS) from the circulatory system [1]. Circulating immune cells normally do not enter the healthy brain unless the BBB is damaged [2]. Despite the immune privilege, a physical deterioration may occur in the BBB due to reasons such as inflammation, hypertension, autoimmunity, and cancer, and cause circulatory immune cells to enter CNS and increase inflammation. We aimed to clarify the complex relationship of BBB and neuroinflammation through the simulation of monocyte migration through the BBB. In vitro BBB model was created using bacterial cellulose (BC) as basal membranes. BC pore size was modified using polycaprolactone microspheres. BCs were shown to have a pore diameter of 4-10 \u00b5m. Human brain microvascular endothelial cells were seeded in the luminal portion of the Cell Crown inserts, and tight junctions were followed by TEER measurements. Neuroinflammation model was created on thrice-subcloned cell line derived from the SK-N-SH neuroblastoma (SHSY-5Y) cells by hydrogen peroxide treatment in the abluminal part. After reaching the target TEER value and inflammation level, fluorescently labeled monocyte cells were introduced from the luminal part, and their migration to abluminal part was evaluated. A major challenge in diagnosis and therapy of neurodegenerative diseases is the crossing of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). In vitro BBB models are available as a screening platform [1], but they only mimic healthy conditions without taking into account the BBB alterations associated with neurodegenerative diseases [2].",

            "text": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) plays a key role in normal neuronal function, disease and aging as it serves the needs for homeostasis, entry of nutrients, and communication of the central nervous system (CNS) [1,2]. BBB remodeling has been indicated in the pathogenesis of various CNS diseases such as neuronopathic lysosomal storage diseases or Alzheimer's disease [3,4]. Moreover, the neuroprotective role of the BBB hinders rapid and wide systemic delivery of therapeutic drugs or diagnostic agents to the CNS [5]. The BBB comprises approximately 600 km of capillaries formed by highly specialized brain capillary endothelial cells (BrEC), which are characterized by less pinocytotic activity, a lack of fenestrations, and unique expression patterns of trans-membrane transport receptors [6]. Inter-endothelial tight junctions form a physical barrier that blocks the contents of blood from entering the brain through para-cellular routes [7]. Astrocytic end-feet surround more than 90% of the BrEC abluminal surface and, together with pericytes, microglial cells, and neuronal endings, form the neurovascular unit and influence the \"tightness\" and trafficking function of the barrier [8]. The complexity of BBB architecture heightens the difficulty of developing BBB models that capture physical and biological characteristics of the BBB in a physiologically relevant geometry, thus contributing to the paucity of therapies and diagnoses for most neurological disorders [3]. Inconclusive or sometimes contradictory results in BBB-related studies are attributable, in part, to a shortage of standardized and systematically validated evaluation tools. \n\nTwo widely used approaches for studying the BBB in vitro include brain endothelial cell culture-based models and the utilization of isolated primary brain microvessels (BrMV). While an ultimate cell culture system that possesses all major BrEC properties remains to be developed [9,10], microvessels freshly isolated from the brain largely retain their functional and cellular characters and molecular signatures as displayed in vivo, which is critical for the BBB research and the development/optimization of brain drug delivery [11].",

Hence, the subject of this paper is to review the nanocarriers presently used to diagnose and treat the most prevalent neurological disorders (Figure 1). \n\nPharmaceutics 2019, 11, 101 2 of 23 of these diseases is becoming a great concern [5]. Neurological pathologies are characterized by processes involving protein aggregation which subsequently lead to neurodegeneration or dysregulation of immune mechanisms, or by the progressive loss of neuronal structure and function, associated with abnormalities in brain development and function and neuronal death [6,7]. However, diagnosis, management, and monitoring strategies for neurological disorders are currently unsuccessful mostly due to the complexity of the nervous system [8,9]. Additionally, their diagnosis and treatment involve high precision, dedication, and experience [9]. Furthermore, the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB) represents the main cause for limitations in the management of neurological diseases [7]. The BBB comprises the neurovascular unit which includes specialized endothelial cells, pericytes, astrocytes, neurons, and the extracellular matrix [10]. The BBB represents the dynamic interface between the brain and the circulating blood, acting as a gateway to protect the brain from toxins and cells and to maintain its proper microenvironment [11,12] through the tight junctions, an intricate system of proteins between the endothelial cells [10]. By contrast, the BCSFB consists in epithelial cells only, which are responsible for the physical and chemical properties. Similarly, the tight junctions between the epithelial cells prevent the paracellular diffusion of molecules into the cerebrospinal fluid. If the molecules penetrate the barrier, they may enter into the interstitial fluid of the brain [13].",

Transport routes of the drug molecules across the BBB occurs via the pathways including paracellular and transcellular diffusion, receptor-mediated transcytosis, cell-mediated transcytosis, transporter-mediated transcytosis, and adsorptive mediated transcytosis (Fig. 1a). 10 Many efforts have been made in response to each process of the drug transportation, which have also been accompanied by reviews of latest progress in this field, but most of literature emphasize the BBB breakdown in specific brain disorders, [11][12][13][14] or give a general review of delivery strategies concentrating on the barrier physiology. 15,16 On the basis of these strategies, functional materials with small size, tailored architecture and therapeutic motifs that facilitate the targeted drug delivery are widely engineered. 3][24] Improved performance of brain-targeted drug delivery was proved thanks to these materials with obvious advantages including non-invasive delivery, high drug loading, good biocompatibility, prolonged blood circulation, and importantly brain targeting effect. Over the past few years, we have witnessed the booming advances in exploiting materials science and nanotechnology in brain-targeted drug delivery. Brain disorder therapy utilizing tailored systems has been a benefactor of this emergence, yet a timely and comprehensive review is lacking. In the light of excellent performance of BBB crossing strategies for enhanced drug delivery, we will first summarize the structure and different cells contributing to the integrity of BBB (Fig. 1b). Further, main BBB crossing strategies derived are highlighted with relevant transcytosis mechanisms as well as their interactions at barrier interface (Fig. 1c). Specifically, we addressed the issues of different pathways from passive transcytosis, intranasal administration, ligands conjugation for brain targeting, membrane coating for brain targeting, to stimuli-mediated BBB disruption. Then, the updated progress of customized materials was overviewed and how they were fabricated and utilized for the treatment of brain disorders was summarized (Fig. 1d). The discussion of potential translational trials and the remaining challenging in this field will also be presented.",

            "text": "Abstract The central nervous system (CNS) diseases are major contributors to death and disability worldwide. However, the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) often prevents drugs intended for CNS diseases from effectively crossing into the brain parenchyma to deliver their therapeutic effects. The blood\u2013brain barrier is a semi-permeable barrier with high selectivity. The BBB primarily manages the transport of substances between the blood and the CNS. To enhance drug delivery for CNS disease treatment, various brain-based drug delivery strategies overcoming the BBB have been developed. Among them, nanoparticles (NPs) have been emphasized due to their multiple excellent properties. This review starts with an overview of the BBB\u2019s anatomical structure and physiological roles, and then explores the mechanisms, both endogenous and exogenous, that facilitate the NP passage across the BBB. The text also delves into how nanoparticles' shape, charge, size, and surface ligands affect their ability to cross the BBB and offers an overview of different nanoparticle classifications. This review concludes with an examination of the current challenges in utilizing nanomaterials for brain drug delivery and discusses corresponding directions for solutions. This review aims to propose innovative diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for CNS diseases and enhance drug design for more effective delivery across the BBB. Graphical abstract",

            "text": "Despite the developments and advances of research, brain targeting is considered one of the challenging tasks. Among the most prominent central nervous system (CNS) disorders are brain tumor or glioma, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, strokes, seizure or epilepsy, schizophrenia, migraine, traumatic brain injuries, cerebral palsy, CNS infection, and several psychological disorders including depression, anxiety, depression and many others. 1 Multiple therapies including surgery, deep brain stimulation, intravenous (IV), oral and topical dosage forms, and rehabilitation therapies are currently available. However, conventional therapies have certain limitations that aid the drug entry into general blood circulation after passing different physiological barriers like the blood-brain barrier (BBB) as part of the apparent blood distribution volume. 2 After that drug cargo reaches the brain to a lesser amount, exhibits limited therapeutic efficacy. In comparison, surgical approaches and brain implants are considered unsafe, short-term and highly invasive treatment approaches. 3,4 One of the critical obstacles to therapeutics entry into the CNS is the BBB. The blood-brain barrier acts as a neuroprotective barrier by maintaining CNS homeostasis by displaying a sure sign of a higher metabolic rate. The brain is a challenging organ for medication administration since the BBB is the finest gatekeeper, shielding the CNS from external drugs. As a result, drug transport to the brain is problematic since many pharmaceuticals lack solubility, lipophilicity, and bioavailability, and the BBB can inhibit 98% of drugs. Because conventional medication therapies are inadequate, developing strategies to deliver therapeutic pharmaceuticals to the CNS safely and effectively is critical. Treatment failure in brain targeting is associated with a variety of difficult pharmaceutical issues, such as pharmacological or toxicity concerns, multiple drug resistance (MDR), the complex anatomical structure of delivery vehicles, and brain capillary endothelial cells (BCECs) that form the BBB. 5,6 BCECs are classically considered a significant opportunity for brain drug targeting due to a wide-ranging network of receptors and transporters that enable the transport of essential components, including small solutes and large hydrophilic compounds (insulin, transferrin, etc.). The BBB also protects",

            "text": "The brain is a site of relative immune privilege. The immunological perspective of the brain has gradually evolved with sequential identifications of linkages between the brain and the immune system. The blood-brain-barrier effectively stops macromolecules, but subsets of leukocytes can interact with the intact barrier and cross over into the perivascular space in low numbers (Hickey, 1991(Hickey, , 1999Wekerle et al., 1991). Passage from the blood to the brain is a tightly regulated two-step process involving: (1) passage over the endothelial layer delineating the capillaries and the basal membrane into the perivascular space, and (2) passage over the glia limitans that builds the border between the perivascular space and the brain parenchyma. The first step occurs even under physiological conditions, whereas the crossing of the glia limitans is usually considered to occur in concert with a neuroinflammatory event (Hickey, 1991(Hickey, , 1999Mundt et al., 2019;Wekerle et al., 1991). Leukocytes can also potentially enter the brain parenchyma from the cerebrospinal fluid, but need to cross the ependymal cell layer that delineate the ventricles (Bechmann et al., 2007;Engelhardt and Ransohoff, 2012;Wilson et al., 2010). In conjunction with the communication between perivascular spaces with the subarachnoidal space, the periarterial/perivascular drainage (Engelhardt et al., 2016;Weller et al., 2008), the recent re-discovery of extensive brain lymphatics draining the dura mater (Da Mesquita et al., 2018;Louveau et al., 2015), and vascular channels linking the bonemarrow of the skull to the brain surface (Herisson et al., 2018), it is becoming increasingly clear that the brain is a part of the immune surveillance network that covers the entire body.

It is, however, a considerably fragile organ, and therefore found enclosed in the cranium of the skull. Despite this physical enclosure to resist mechanical insult, it must further be physically protected from exposure to toxins and microorganisms present in the systemic circulation and the integrity of its physiological environment must be maintained. The BBB also acts as a strict barrier to the passage of xenobiotics, and, as a result, it is an aspect to circumvent to achieve adequate pharmaceutical delivery. In the brain, there are three such principal barriers: the blood-brain barrier (BBB), blood-leptomeningeal barrier (BLMB) and the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB), with the former constituting the key homeostatic regulator mediating transport between the peripheral circulation and the CNS [26]. \n\nThe BBB is a cellular barrier constituted primarily by a concentric series of microvessel non-fenestrated continuous endothelial cells with tight junction adjoints, which was first described by Paul Ehrlich in 1885 [27]. This barrier thus exquisitely regulates the passage of xenobiotics, microorganisms and endogenous entities such as macrophages and endopeptides. It is increasingly acknowledged that the BBB is in fact far more complicated in composition, with contributions from several proteins (i.e., claudin-5 [28] and cell types (e.g., perivascular astrocytes), as the former provide high transendothelial potential resistances in the order of ~1500 Ohm/cm 2 [29], thus significantly hampering paracellular mechanism of drug delivery, and the latter contribute to capillary phenotypic regulation. \n\nThis constitutes a significant hindrance to the development of therapeutic or diagnostic agents for brain-targeted drug delivery, as many agents may appear bioactive but cannot be permitted across this barrier.",

            "text": "Despite the mechanisms of how EXOs reaches the brain still being unknown, they are considered promising therapeutic agents for brain protection. Indeed, intranasal administration of EXOs-encapsulated curcumin in LPS-induced brain inflammation and in autoimmune encephalomyelitis in C57BL/6j induced a reduction in the number of activated inflammatory microglial cells [234]. The treatment with EXOs-encapsulated curcumin of stroke injury in type-1 diabetic mice ameliorates neurodegeneration, promotes neuronal survival and restores cognitive function by reducing infarct volume, edema and vascular damage [235]. In a model of mouse cerebral ischemia, treatment with EXOs-encapsulated curcumin reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 levels and efficiently suppressed inflammation and cellular apoptosis in the lesion region of the ischemic brain [236]. Curcumin primed EXOs, prepared by incubating mouse brain endothelial cells with 7.5 \u00b5M curcumin for 72 h protected brain endothelial cell layer permeability by decreasing oxidative stress and mitigating impaired junction proteins [237]. Curcuminloaded exosomes, isolated from mouse embryonic stem cells and administered nasally to ischemia-injured mice, was distributed into all brain regions and improved the neurological score after three days of treatment. In addition, the treatment restored vascular endothelial tight (claudin-5 and occludin) and adherent (VE-cadherin) junction proteins, suggesting that combining the potentials of embryonic stem cell exosomes and curcumin can help neurovascular restoration following ischemia-reperfusion injury in mice [238].",

            "text": "Efficient drug delivery to the restricted confines of the brain stands as a pivotal aspect in the treatment of brain diseases. The Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB), an intricate network of cells including astrocytes and endothelial cells, poses a formidable obstacle to drug delivery into the brain [1]. Its presence precludes numerous potentially effective drugs, such as anticancer agents, from diffusing adequately into the brain parenchyma and accumulating at the desired sites of action [2]. In response to this challenge, the rapid development of central nervous system (CNS) implantable devices for multifaceted applications, including the management of conditions such as Parkinson's disease, depression, and epilepsy [3][4][5], has revolutionized conventional treatment patterns. However, a significant drawback lies in their biocompatibility [6]. The development of brain implants is inherently limited, and their long-term clinical application entails unclear risks [7]. While there are numerous short-term benefits associated with medical implants, their biocompatibility remains a case of concern due to the potential for long-term side effects in patients [8][9][10]. A deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying their biocompatibility is indispensable for the development of more effective and safer novel therapies. \n\nEnsuring safety in neural implants is critical, as their size poses challenges in tissue tolerance, leading to inflammation and glial scar formation due to mechanical imbalances with brain tissue [8,11,12]. Cytotoxicity or inflammation could impair neurological function and reduce treatment efficacy in confined spaces [13]. While larger implants may not be suitable for long-term use [14], smaller, non-tethered small implants are believed to cause less trauma, offering greater precision and functionality [14]. Tethered implants, though useful for continuous monitoring [15], can trigger stronger immune responses and tissue damage due to their invasiveness [14,16]. Non-tethered implants, by minimizing physical interference, offer a more patient-friendly option with reduced chronic inflammation and better immune tolerance.",

            "text": "Most neurological disorders compromise the central nervous system (CNS) and its main organ, the brain. These disorders include stroke, brain cancer, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, neuroinfections, and traumatic disorders of the nervous system, among others (http://www.who.int/en/). Because millions of people worldwide are affected by CNS disorders, they constitute 6.3% of the global burden of disease. In other words, CNS diseases are a huge world of burden of human suffering with negative economic results [1]. Most of the therapeutic molecules cannot attain the brain because of the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which separates the bloodstream from the cerebral parenchyma [2]. This barrier is mainly composed by endothelial cells, which are linked by tight junctions [3]. The BBB also contains a basal membrane, pericytes, and astrocytes [3]. More important is the presence of efflux transporters that perform active back-transport of the therapeutic molecules to the blood lumen. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is the most important efflux transporter associated to the failure of various therapies to treat CNS diseases [4]. Advances in nanomedicine have created a non-invasive strategy for the management of CNS diseases [5]. This strategy emphasizes on the encapsulation of therapeutic compounds, which are mainly P-gp substrates, in drug delivery systems, also called nanocarriers, such as liposomes, lipid nanocapsules, polymeric nanoparticles, or polymersomes [6][7][8][9][10]. Encapsulation of therapeutic compounds in drug delivery systems improve their solubility and protect them from the biological environment and circumvent the P-gp at the BBB yielding higher concentrations of the therapeutic compounds in the brain parenchyma [5].

            "text": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) has been a great hurdle for brain drug delivery. The BBB in healthy brain is a diffusion barrier essential for protecting normal brain function by impeding most compounds from transiting from the blood to the brain; only small molecules can cross the BBB. Under certain pathological conditions of diseases such as stroke, diabetes, seizures, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer disease, the BBB is disrupted. The objective of this review is to provide a broad overview on current strategies for brain drug delivery and related subjects from the past five years. It is hoped that this review could inspire readers to discover possible approaches to deliver drugs into the brain. After an initial overview of the BBB structure and function in both healthy and pathological conditions, this review re-visits, according to recent publications, some questions that are controversial, such as whether nanoparticles by themselves could cross the BBB and whether drugs are specifically transferred to the brain by actively targeted nanoparticles. Current non-nanoparticle strategies are also reviewed, such as delivery of drugs through the permeable BBB under pathological conditions and using non-invasive techniques to enhance brain drug uptake. Finally, one particular area that is often neglected in brain drug delivery is the influence of aging on the BBB, which is captured in this review based on the limited studies in the literature.",

Each solution was drawn into PTFE tubing and loaded into the device at the following flow rates: 10 \u00b5L/min, 4 \u00b5L/min, 70 \u00b5L/min, and 35 \u00b5L/min, listed from innermost to outermost phases. Hydrogel microcapsules were collected in 1.5-mL tubes (Eppendorf) only after flow rates had stabilized since the formation of the hydrogel capsule depends on the uniform mixture with acetic acid. All oil was removed from the tube and the drops were briefly resuspended in HFE-7500 oil with 0.4% acetic acid to ensure the gelation of the microcapsules and to remove excess surfactant. The drops were then resuspened twice in HFE-7500 oil only. Excess oil was removed and 200 \u00b5L of 2 mM CaCl 2 with 0.05% Triton-X was added on top of the microcapsule layer. To transfer the microcapsules into the aqueous phase, 50 \u00b5L (or greater than 20 v/v%) of 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctanol (Alfa Aesar) was added to the oil phase and the tube was gently inverted until the microcapsules could no longer be seen in the oil phase. Any remaining oil was removed using gel loading pipette tips and the microcapsules were centrifuged at 200 \u00d7 g for 2 min. If any residual oil remained, it was again removed and the microcapsules were washed with fresh 2 mM CaCl 2 solution three times.",

            "text": "The existence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a major limiting factor for efficient delivery of therapeutic agents into the CNS. BBB is constituted by endothelial cell tight junctions in the brain microvessels and has a complex and highly organized multicellular structure 43,44 . The BBB effectively protects the brain from most harmful substances in the external environment, and also excludes from the brain \u223c100% of large-molecule neurotherapeutics and more than 98% of all small-molecule drugs 45 . Therefore, although acting as both morphological and functional barrier, the BBB also hinders effective drug delivery to the brain and impedes the therapy of various neurological disorders. Herein, development of nanocarriers that possess BBB permeability is of great importance.\n\nTo address the limitation of crossing the BBB, many strategies have been investigated. Receptor-mediated transcytosis has been utilized as a key strategy for drug delivery across the BBB. The LDLR on the brain endothelial cell surface is a major apoE receptor that regulates the amount of apoE in the CNS 46 . Recent studies found that targeting LDLR provided a rational strategy for efficient transport across the BBB via receptor-mediated transcytosis and subsequent drug release in the brain 47 . It has been found that the bioactive apoE peptides were capable of binding to LDL receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) tightly in a purified system and apoE could bind to LDLR family only after being incorporated into lipids 48 . Therefore, apoE-rHDL holds great promise for possessing BBB-penetrating activity and brain drug delivery via LDLR-mediated transcytosis. For instance, Song et al. 49 developed apoE-rHDL as a biomimetic nanocarrier for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. They utilized apoE3, one of the predominant apoE isoforms for construction of apoE-rHDL in which the N-terminal domain of apoE3 interacted with LDLR to mediate transcytosis. This biologically inspired nanocarrier successfully crossed the BBB (Fig. 2), promoted microglial and astroglial degradation of amyloid beta (A\u03b2) and rescued memory deficits in Alzheimer model mice.",

            "text": "In recent decades, the improvement in the quality of life in developed countries has led to an increase in life expectancy and, thus, the aged population, which is closely related to the increase in the prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases [1]. Neurodegeneration is defined as progressive damage in neural tissues drifting to an irrecoverable neuronal loss, which impacts cognitive function, motor activity, and the mental impairment of these patients [2]. These pathologies encompass a large variety of disorders with different pathological patterns and clinical manifestations, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), epilepsy, Parkinson's disease (PD), and multiple sclerosis (MS) [3]. \n\nOne of the main problems involving the success of pharmacological therapies in treating these diseases is the limited passage of exogenous molecules into the central nervous system (CNS) [4]. Restricted drug delivery into the brain is mostly attributed to the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The endothelial cell barrier comprises the main physical barrier where different molecules involved in the transport of substances are found. This penetration restriction stems mainly from the tight junctions between the endothelial cells, the lack of transcellular pathways, especially for hydrophilic drugs, and the unavailability of transport vesicles [5]. Because of these, crossing the BBB has gained much attention within the scientific and health communities. Drugs administered systemically must pass from the blood circulation into the CNS by crossing this physiological barrier, whose fundamental function is to protect the CNS from harmful substances [5]. \n\nExosomes are extracellular vesicles (EVs) loaded with a wide variety of molecules, such as RNA, amino acids, lipids, metabolites, or proteins from their cells of origin [6]. Exosome biogenesis is initiated by plasma membrane invagination of the origin cell and is located in multivesicular bodies (MVBs), which are formed intracellularly [7]. Then, MVBs are transported to the luminal side of the plasma membrane through the microtubule network and the cytoskeleton [7], and exosomes are released to the cytosol by an exocytosis process [7].",

            "text": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is located at the level of the cerebral microvasculature and is critical for maintain central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis. Although the BBB restricts the entry of potentially neurotoxic substances in the brain, it also presents a major obstacle to the delivery of therapeutics into the CNS for disease treatment. The BBB exhibits a small rate of pinocytosis and possesses tight junctions (TJ) which form a seal between opposing endothelial membranes 1 . The presence of TJ at the BBB creates a high transendothelial electrical resistance of 1500-2000 \u03a9\u2022cm 2 compared to 3-30 \u03a9\u2022cm 2 across most peripheral microvessels 2, 3 . This high resistance is associated with very low permeability, i.e. the BBB greatly restricts paracellular diffusion of solutes from the blood into the brain. Typically, only minute, lipophilic molecules appreciably cross the normal, healthy BBB via transcellular passive diffusion, although some limited transport of certain peptides and peptide analogs has been reported 4 . Essential nutrients such as glucose or iron gain entry into the CNS through specific transporters such as the glucose transporter 1 or receptors such as the transferrin receptor 5, 6 . Receptors and transporters for gastrointestinal hormones involved in regulating metabolism are expressed at the BBB in order to convey information between the CNS and periphery 7 . In addition to its low paracellular permeability and low rate of pinocytosis, the BBB also expresses a high number of drug transporters (e.g. Pglycoprotein) which further restrict brain entry of many endogenous and exogenous substances that would otherwise be predicted to cross the BBB based on molecular weight (MW) and lipophilicity considerations 8, 9 . \n\nAlthough there are many examples of small MW drugs which cross the BBB, nearly all large MW substances are severely restricted from crossing the BBB under normal conditions; indeed, the only examples of large MW drugs approved for clinical use in treating a neurological illness are those that act via peripheral mechanisms. Many large MW substances have shown substantial promise in treating aspects of CNS diseases based on studies utilizing in vitro systems and animal models.",

            "text": "The BBB, blood-CSF barrier (BCB), and arachnoid barrier are the three major interfaces formed by distinct cells.Microvascular endothelial cells that line the cerebral capillaries and enter most mammalian brains, spinal cords, and other organisms with a fully developed CNS constitute the BBB.Given that the average adult total surface area falls between 12 and 18 m 2 and the average microvessel surface area per gram of tissue is between 150 and 200 cm, it is regarded as the largest interface for blood-brain exchange.BBB is essential for shielding the brain parenchyma from blood-borne pathogens and acts as a formidable barrier against the entry of medications and other exogenous substances into the CNS. 149hree methods-non-invasive, invasive, and identifying alternate drug delivery pathways-can transport a nanomaterialbased BBB throughout the brain. 150Noninvasive methods widely used in research depend on biological processes to help drugs pass through transcellular channels and the blood-brain barrier (Figure 3). 151The intranasal delivery method effectively crosses the BBB by delivering NPs through the olfactory epithelium or trigeminal nerves directly into the BBB. 152However, this is challenging for large proteins to do so.With low cellular toxicity and high effectiveness, cell-penetrating peptide (CPP)based delivery methods can successfully transport macromolecules across cellular membranes. 138The BBB must be physically broken apart for the invasive mechanism to function, and nanomaterials must be transferred along paracellular channels to cross the BBB (Figure 3). 153The transient BBB disruption technique described above and local delivery strategy are part of the invasive mechanism, also known as the paracellular mechanism. 154In the non-invasive approach, the BBB is unaltered during the drug delivery process, and NPs are delivered across the BBB via transcellular channel. 155Noninvasive or transcellular intranasal delivery strategies include four BBB crossing methods: CPP-mediated, receptor-mediated, shuttle peptide-mediated, and cell-mediated.\n\nIn contrast, invasive procedures manipulate the BBB or directly administer medications to the brain tissue. 156",

            "text": "CNS diseases, such as epilepsy, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, Parkinson, and others, are defined as disorders that affect different parts of the brain (29). As stated by the world health organization (WHO), millions of people are suffering from neurological diseases worldwide (29). Medications used for the treatment of these disorders are usually given orally or parenterally. In order to be effective, the CNS medications should be transferred from the systemic bloodstream into the brain (where their active target is located) by crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The BBB is a membrane layer that surrounds the microvasculature of the brain creating an interface between the blood and the tissues of the CNS (2)(3). It serves as a diffusion layer that regulates the passage of nutrients, drugs as well as other chemicals from the blood to the neuronal tissues thus regulating the proper functioning of the CNS (2)(30).\n\nThree cellular elements constitute the BBB including the endothelial cells, the astrocyte end-feet, and pericytes (2). The endothelial cells of the BBB are unique from those in other parts of the body by the presence of tight joints between cells and the scattering of pinocytic transport vesicles (2)(31). These tight junctions restrict the paracellular movement of water-soluble molecules (including many therapeutic agents) while small lipophilic molecules can diffuse transcellular across the plasma membrane in accordance with their concentration gradient (31). Furthermore, the entrance of many lipid-soluble molecules into the brain is impeded by the availability of diverse efflux transporters that belong to the ABC-binding cassette. These transporters are non-specific and have the capability to actively efflux a broad scope of highly lipid-soluble substances that could spread easily through the plasma membrane, back to the blood (30) (31). Large entities (including many nutrients) can infiltrate to the brain by approaches that are facilitated by transporters and receptor-mediated endocytosis (31). All of these obstacles increase the difficulty for the CNS drugs to reach their active sites (4)(32).\n\nThe nasal mucosa is the only place in the body at which the brain becomes in a close",

            "text": "Central nervous system (CNS) tumors represent the primary cause of cancer-related death in children [1][2][3]. Treatment modalities include surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy with outcomes largely depending on the biological aggressiveness of the disease and marginal improvement in the last decade [4]. Delivering diagnostic and therapeutic agents to central nervous system represents a critical challenge due to the presence of the bloodbrain barrier (BBB) that represents a dynamic, semi-permeable barrier whose function is to protect nervous system microenvironment from pathogens or toxins, separating blood from brain [5]. The tight junctions between endothelial cells along with the basal membrane, characterized by laminin, collagen, and fibronectin, in which contractile pericytes are located, limit the passage or transport of solutes. Additionally, in the BBB astrocytic end-feet are also involved in blocking the free diffusion of molecules. Moreover, some brain regions as the pons have a more restrictive BBB towards the entry of molecules compared with other brain areas, this may have significant consequences for preclinical drug penetration studies and for the treatment of CNS tumors, particularly in diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) [6]. Moreover, BBB allows the passive diffusion of small size molecules such as the indispensable gas oxygen, water, and some hydrophobic solute, as well as lipophilic molecules with a positive surface charge, the latter representing the majority of current diagnostic and therapeutic agents. Meanwhile, the passage of polar components is only permitted by the presence of specific carriers through an active transport (i.e., glucose and amino acids) [7]. Additional BBB crossing mechanisms such as receptor-mediated transcytosis and adsorptive transcytosis occur, and they are currently being explored in order to expand the repertoire of drugs able to pharmacologically penetrate BBB [8]. For example, the most common modification of water-soluble drugs take place through the addition of lipid for allowing passive diffusion into the brain [9]; also, the development of peptide-drug conjugates with a transportable peptide such as insulin, transferrin, etc., through a disulfide bond.",

            "text": "Accumulating evidence shows that EVs can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) from both directions. Bio-distribution analysis of fluorescent or luciferase labeled EVs has provided ample evidence of EVs entering the brain from the periphery. These studies show that 0.5-2% of EVs from various cancer cell lines accumulate in the brain after being injected into the circulation (Lai et al., 2014;Hoshino et al., 2015;Wiklander et al., 2015). In addition, peripheral EVs were shown to deliver siRNA, miRNA, and mRNA to central targets after passing through the BBB (Alvarez-Erviti et al., 2011;Bala et al., 2015). These observations establish the therapeutic potential of EVs as a drug delivery platform. There is also evidence for exosomes crossing the BBB from the brain into the circulation. For example, glioblastoma specific mRNA has been found in circulating EVs and was also suggested as a biomarker (Skog et al., 2008;Noerholm et al., 2012;Chen et al., 2013). Following inflammation of the striatum, EVs have been shown to cross the BBB and recruit neutrophils from the liver. In addition, astrocyte-derived EVs were also found in the circulation (Goetzl et al., 2016b, Dr. Norman J. Haughey personal communication). We present evidence (below) that brain EVs can be recovered from peripheral blood of genetically modified animals.",

Thus, the term blood brain barrier is designated to describe a lipid-containing membrane or barrier which limits the accessibility of polar substances to the brain. This concept holds well in most cases. In a few instances, however, fairly liposoluble substances such as morphine (1, 2) demonstrate a low distribution to the brain. On the other hand, we have observed that chlorpromazine sulfoxide, a polar substance, was found in the brain in a substantial amount following an intraperitoneal injection to rats, even after a rigorous perfusion of the brain with hypertonic as well as isotonic NaCl or KCl solutions (unpublished observations). These facts raised the question whether liposolubility per se is the sole factor determining the permeability of a drug through a blood brain barrier.",

            "text": "The treatment of neurological pathologies often suffers from serious drawbacks related to the difficulty of delivering drugs across the blood brain barrier (BBB) to the site of interest at an effective concentration [1]. The BBB is a complex system composed of endothelial cells tight junctions, pericytes, and astrocytes which, together with the efflux proteins on the BBB surface, are considered the \"security wall\" of the central nervous system, regulating the entry of foreign substances in the brain [2]. Lipophilic xenobiotics can passively diffuse from the blood to the brain by crossing both the apical and basal membranes of endothelial cells [3]. On the other hand, hydrophilic compounds necessary for the neuronal functionality (e.g., glucose, \u03b1-amino acids, and vitamins) can be up-taken within the brain via specific cell membrane transporters [4]. Finally, high molecular weight molecules (e.g., peptide and proteins), which are too large for cell membrane transporters, can cross the endothelium to a limited degree through a vesicular route, either by specific receptor-mediated or adsorptive-mediated transcytosis [5]. \n\nSuch a complex barrier, although being effective in protecting the brain from toxic molecules, hinders the entry of a large proportion of pharmacologically active molecules suitable for the treatment of many brain disease and disorders [6]. Thus, a significant challenge consists in designing therapeutic approaches to increase the number of drugs capable to overcome the BBB and/or improve their concentration in the brain. Biodegradable nanocarriers have been proposed as adequate solution to meet these needs by virtue of their small size and the ability to easily penetrate into cells, thus efficiently delivering drugs in the central nervous system [7].",

            "text": "Cannabidiol (CBD) is a potent non-psychoactive constituent in marijuana (Cannabis sativa) with no reported intoxicating effects unlike tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) [1]. CBD binds to receptors CB1, CB2 and 5HT1A to modulate cellular activity and inhibit excitotoxicity [2]. The anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of CBD have been reported across numerous pathologies, including neurodegenerative and metabolic diseases. Studies show that repeated administration of CBD may be neuroprotective in animal models of Alzheimer's disease via decreasing microglial activation and attenuation of memory deficits [3]. Furthermore, activation of the endocannabinoid system has been shown to preserve the cerebral capillary endothelium that forms the blood brain barrier (BBB) [4,5] and exert therapeutic effects in animal models of diabetes [6]. \n\nCBD is highly lipophilic, sensitive to light and largely broken down in the duodenum resulting in extremely low oral bioavailability in plasma and tissues (approximately 6% and 1%, respectively) [7]. Whilst chronic usage of CBD is clinically well tolerated, its lability poses limitations for use in research and adaptation as a pharmacotherapy [8]. Therefore, emerging studies have focused on encapsulation techniques that function as a vehicle for CBD [9]. \n\nSodium alginate is an extract from brown algae that is biocompatible, hydrophilic, nontoxic and readily available for human use. The alginate cross-links with multivalent ions like Ca 2+ to form stable hydrogel polymers under mild aqueous conditions [10]. Thus, calcium alginate microcapsules provide a 'physical' barrier for volatile drugs such as CBD against exposure to light and air in pharmacological protocols. Previously, our studies have demonstrated that sodium alginate microcapsules significantly increase the brain uptake and associated neuroprotective effects of probucol-the highly lipophilic, antilipidemic drug [11].",

CHS has been utilized in numerous studies for intranasal targeting to the brain. 42,69 The encapsulation of drug was done in the NE that provided significant protection against biological and chemical degradation from the external environment, as well as facilitated extracellular transport through P-glycoprotein-mediated efflux. This mechanism contributes to the increased availability of the drug in CNS. The nanoscale of these formulations allows for easy transportation through olfactoryneurons to the brain, utilizing the olfactory-membrane's various endocytic-pathways found in sustentacular and neuronal cells, which is beneficial for treating diseases basically related to brain. 28 Based on the results of our research studies, CHS-EUGE-NE was employed to enhance the direct delivery of Eugenol (EUGE) to the brain, thereby improving its bioavailability and targeting. \n\nDepression is a significant contributor to global suicide rates. Typically, treatments for depression are administered orally, which can lead to several side effects and limited therapeutic efficacy, resulting in patient intolerability. The antidepressant action of Eugenol relies on maintaining therapeutic concentrations in the central nervous system (CNS) over extended periods. 53 However, there are significant challenges in crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB) when drugs are administered intravenously or orally. The intranasal route is considered the most effective for brain-targeted delivery, allowing drugs to reach the brain directly through neuronal and extracellular pathways. To enhance brain targeting via the intranasal route, we utilized chitosan, to create a mucoadhesive formulation of CHS-EUGE-NE. 42 The rat olfactory area, located in the posterior part of the nasal cavity, facilitates the delivery and absorption of drugs through this route.

            "text": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) consists of several structural components, including endothelial cells with tight junctions, pericytes, astrocytic endfeet, and extracellular matrix components [33,34]. These components work together to tightly regulate the passage of substances from the bloodstream into the brain capillaries. Tight junctions between endothelial cells form a seal that restricts the movement of molecules, while specialized transporter proteins selectively control the entry of essential nutrients into the brain. Astrocytic endfeet surrounding blood vessels help maintain BBB integrity by releasing signaling molecules that influence endothelial cell function and tight junction formation [33,34]. By collaborating through these mechanisms, the BBB establishes a robust barrier, safeguarding the brain from potentially harmful substances while permitting the passage of essential molecules necessary for proper brain function. While the BBB serves as a protective barrier, it also poses a significant challenge in the treatment of neurological disorders. Many drugs are unable to cross the BBB efficiently, limiting their effectiveness in neuroprotection. \n\nHowever, during conditions such as stroke, the structure of the BBB is partially disrupted, leading to increased permeability to molecules and particles, which can facilitate the entry of nanoparticles without targeted modifications into the brain parenchyma [35]. Initially, the upregulation of caveolin expression in endothelial cells enhances the transcellular transport of nanoparticles, while the subsequent breakdown of tight junctions promotes particle crossing via the paracellular route [36]. This phenomenon has enabled many unmodified nanomedicines to passively accumulate in the brain following stroke [36][37][38][39]. The positive zeta potential could significantly enhance the interaction between the S/G@COF and the negatively charged BBB. \n\nTo test the capability of S/G@COF in crossing the BBB, S/G@COF was labeled with rhodamine B, an easy-detectable staining fluorescent dye. At different time points post injection (0.5, 1, 3, 6, 9, 24 h), the in vivo fluorescence signals in the brain were recorded and analyzed.",

Its health benefits have led to recent increases in the consumption of curcumin. It has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities and is a potent neuroprotective against diseases of the brain. Nevertheless, its low bioavailability and its relative difficulty crossing the blood-brain barrier limit curcumin\u2019s use for these purposes. Curcumin-loaded nanoparticles may be an effective treatment for several diseases although there is a paucity of studies reporting its safety in the central nervous system (CNS). Therefore, this study aimed to identify non-neurotoxic concentrations of free curcumin and two nanoformulations of curcumin. Cell lines BV-2 and SH-SY5Y, both originating from the CNS, were evaluated after 24, 48, and 72\u2009h of treatment with free curcumin and nanocapsules We measured viability, proliferation, and dsDNA levels. We measured levels of reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide as proxies for oxidative stress in culture supernatants. We found that free curcumin was toxic at 10 and 20\u2009\u00b5M, principally at 72\u2009h. Nanoformulations were more neurotoxic than the free form. Safe concentrations of free curcumin are between 1\u20135\u2009\u00b5M, and these concentrations were lower for nanoformulations. We determined the ideal concentrations of free curcumin and nanocapsules serving as a basis for studies of injuries that affect the CNS.",

            "text": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) comprises a specialized network of endothelial cells, pericytes, and astrocytes, acting as a defense mechanism to prevent the extravasation of materials. Tight junctions between adjacent brain endothelial cells limit paracellular transport, restricting the passive entry of molecules to a narrow range of size and lipophilicity. These formidable physical and functional barriers impede the exposure of drugs to intracranial tissues. Tight junctions commonly exclude hydrophilic small molecules from entering the brain, and although many lipophilic drugs can passively diffuse, their penetration into diseased brain tissue is often inefficient. This inefficiency typically necessitates high drug doses, leading to dose-limiting systemic toxicity [105,106]. In light of the numerous challenges associated with the passage of small molecules through the blood-brain barrier, nanoparticles have been investigated as a potential means to enhance drug delivery to brain tissues [107]. Much of the current research has concentrated on improving the passive transport mechanisms of drug-loaded nanoparticles across the BBB. For example, in diseases where the BBB is compromised, such as glioblastoma, nanostructures have been observed to extravasate through leaky vasculature, accumulating at tumor sites. \n\nSimilarly, strategies have been developed to enhance drug delivery across an intact BBB by initially disrupting this barrier [108][109][110][111]. However, such approaches, while allowing unregulated passage across the BBB, may compromise the BBB's homeostatic functions and expose the brain to harmful toxins and pathogens [112]. In contrast, alternative approaches for diseases like SHH subgroup medulloblastoma, where the BBB remains intact, involve the use of nontargeting nanocarriers to prolong the systemic circulation of small-molecule drugs, and over a relatively long time, an appreciable number of drugs would cross the BBB. Nevertheless, this has only partially improved on-target toxicity profiles at high doses [112].",

NPs under 100 nm with optimized surface properties, such as lipophilic coatings or PEGylation, can diffuse across the BBB via adsorptive-mediated transcytosis or nonspecific interactions [19]. Lipid NPs, including liposomes and solid lipid NPs (SLNs), excel in this domain due to their stability and ability to encapsulate both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs. Recent advances in these systems include modifications for extended circulation and targeted release in diseased CNS regions [20].

Despite intense study activities, the numerous \"diseases of the mind\" also have significant deep-rooted issues for improved therapeutic strategies, and CNS therapy can also be effective for other disorders [1]. The complex pathophysiology of neurological disorders, trouble reaching the brain with large as well as small molecular drugs, and risk, uncertainty, and massive costs of controlled clinical trials present major obstacles in the research and production of novel drugs for brain disorders [2]. These issues have caused a drop in the pharmaceutical sector in recent years, with decreased funding in pharmaceutical production for many CNS conditions being identified. Neural disabilities are the world's second leading cause of death (16.8 percent of the world's deaths) and the primary cause of Disability-Adjusted Life Years(DALY) [3]. Oral drug administration is the most appropriate path if clinical consequences are envisaged [4]. Because of numerous disadvantages including a sluggish action and poor bioavailability (40-45%) According to a new World Health Organization (WHO) study, central nervous system (CNS) conditions such as brain cancers, migraine, autism, neurodegenerative disorders (e. g., diseases of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's), and dementia are among the key triggers of human population impairment [6]. Nevertheless, the production of drug therapies for the treatment of brain neurological disorders relies heavily on the capacity of medicinal agents to successfully permeate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and have a major effect on the brain [7,8]. The brain consists of two major barriers stopping external materials: BBB and BCSF. The brain has two major barriers that prohibit the entrance of external materials. When intravenous or oral drugs are used, the BBB must first travel to transfer into the brain [9]. In the last couple of decades, researchers have continued to look at new solutions to the introduction of medications into the brain [7]. The provision of nose-to-brain supplies the immediate supply of medicines to the brain without the need to permeate the BBB which can also avoid adverse effects that may arise as medicines are routinely ingested",

Complex pathophysiological mechanisms evolved in the progression of psychosis include GABAergic, dopaminergic, cholinergic dysfunction, hypofunctioning of NMDA receptors along with neuroinflammation and oxidative stress impedes its treatment (Kumar et al., 2017). Numerous drugs are available for the treatment of psychosis, but they provide only symptomatic relief (Rao & Remington, 2013;Hunter, 2014). Therefore, it is necessary to explore the drugs of different category to overcome this problem. In line with previous studies, tetracycline antibiotics possess neuroprotective, antidepressant, antianxiety, antipsychotics, memory enhancing, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects (Pae et al., 2008;Arakawa et al., 2012;Nagpal et al., 2013), thus, we have selected another tetracycline antibiotic, doxycycline, for the present study. Doxycycline hydrochloride has been used for its neuroprotective effect in previous study (Cho et al., 2009), as well as peripheral side effects appear at higher doses limiting its use for psychiatric disorders (Angelakis et al., 2015;Frye et al., 2015). Consequently, targeting doxycycline hydrochloride to brain can reduce its dose and overcome peripheral side effects for the treatment of psychiatric disorders, but its hydrophilicity deters it crossing the blood brain barrier. Nanoparticulate drug delivery systems have been designed for the targeting of drugs to brain for better efficacy (Kreuter, 2001(Kreuter, , 2002)). Hydrophilic drugs have been encapsulated in nanoparticles as carriers to improve their penetration in brain through blood brain barrier, enhance their bioavailability, minimize side effects as well as facilitate the controlled release of encapsulated drug (Hansraj et al., 2015).",

            "text": "Purpose Ginsenoside Rg3 (Rg3) and Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS) can be used for ischemic stroke treatment, however, the lack of targeting to the ischemic region limits the therapeutic effect. To address this, we leveraged the affinity of macrophage membrane proteins for inflamed brain microvascular endothelial cells to develop a macrophage membrane-cloaked liposome loaded with Rg3 and PNS (MM-Lip-Rg3/PNS), which can precisely target brain lesion region through intranasal administration. Methods MM-Lip-Rg3/PNS was prepared by co-extrusion method and was performed by characterization, stability, surface protein, and morphology. The cellular uptake, immune escape ability, and blood-brain barrier crossing ability of MM-Lip-Rg3/PNS were studied in vitro. The in vivo brain targeting, biodistribution and anti-ischemic efficacy of MM-Lip-Rg3/PNS were evaluated in MACO rats, and we determined the diversity of the nasal brain pathway through the olfactory nerve blockade model in rats. Finally, the pharmacokinetics and brain targeting index of MM-Lip-Rg3/PNS were investigated. Results Our results indicated that MM-Lip-Rg3/PNS was spherical with a shell-core structure. MM-Lip-Rg3/PNS can avoid mononuclear phagocytosis, actively bind to inflammatory endothelial cells, and have the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. Moreover, MM-Lip-Rg3/PNS could specifically target ischemic sites, even microglia, increase the cumulative number of drugs in the brain, improve the inflammatory environment of the brain, and reduce the infarct size. By comparing olfactory nerve-blocking rats with normal rats, it was found that there are direct and indirect pathways for nasal entry into the brain. Pharmacokinetics demonstrated that MM-Lip-Rg3/PNS exhibited stronger brain targeting and prolonged drug half-life. Conclusion MM-Lip-Rg3/PNS might contribute to the accumulation of Rg3 and PNS in the is",

            "text": "terest in assessing the impact of particle elasticity on nanoparticle delivery is a relatively recent development. 19 Spherical poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) nanoparticles of different stiffness showed marked differences in circulation half-lives, as well as uptake in macrophages, endothelial, and epithelial cells. 20 Manipulating particle elasticity also has the ability to alter some of the classical trends observed with other properties, such as size. Hard microparticles are quickly cleared from circulation by the liver and spleen, but soft, discoidal microparticles (6 \u03bcm diameter) can circulate for days, and their circulation time is stiffness-dependant. 21 Soft discoidal particles also accumulate in tumors more than their stiff counterparts, though this is attributed primarily to the differences in circulation times of the particles. 22 livery of nanoparticles to the brain is of particular interest because of the substantial burden that central nervous system (CNS) diseases place on society both in terms of lives lost and disability caused in nonfatal cases. 23 The estimated cost of neurological diseases in the United States alone is over $800 billion. 24 One of the major issues in treating brain diseases is crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB), perhaps the body's most exclusive transport barrier. 6][27][28] As a result, there has been significant research into methods for improving nanoparticle transport through the BBB, using ideas ranging from physically disrupting the endothelium using ultrasound combined with microbubbles, 29 to coating nanoparticles with ligands that enhance transcytosis, 30 to using live cells as delivery vehicles. 31 While there has been some investigation into how nanoparticle properties modulate transport into the brain, 30 overall very little is known about how these differences affect their biological performance. \n\nImproving the design of nanoparticles for brain delivery requires more information on how transport is affected by nanoparticle properties, and the utility of traditional in vivo and in vitro methods is limited in this respect.",

Nanotechnology has emerged as a promising tool to tackle these problems by providing a novel platform to improve the transport of drugs across the physiological barrier. Nanoparticles (promising carriers) have become the major focus of drug delivery research for drug delivery to the brain due to unique characteristics such as small size, enhanced drug solubility, the ability for multi-functionality, a controlled drug release profile, and the potential for site-specific targeting [20]. The nanoparticle surface can be readily modified to incorporate the targeting ligands to bind receptors and transporters at the BBB enables them to bypass receptor mediated endocytosis to improve CNS selectivity and permeability. Various classes of nanoparticles including polymeric, metallic and lipid nanoparticles can also enter the brain and cross the BBB through different endocytotic mechanisms [21].",

            "text": "Brain tumours typically have a poor prognosis with an average life expectancy of approximately one year [75,76]. Among brain cancer types, glioblastoma multiforme is a common tumour [77], with a mean survival rate of ~ 3.3% at three years post-diagnosis [77,78]. Brain cancers have traditionally been treated with a surgical procedure followed by systemic chemotherapy, but these are limited due to the effects on the brain and severe toxicity. Nanocarrier-based strategies to enhance anti-cancer drug delivery into the tumor site within the brain without destroying any healthy tissues or organs are thus being widely studied [79]. \n\nThe major challenge to chemotherapeutic delivery to the brain is the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The BBB is a protective barrier between the blood and brain tissue, preventing molecules from entering the central nervous system [80]. The BBB is formed through microvascular endothelial cells wrapped by tight junctions, adherens junctions, microvessels, pericytes, and astrocytes and interconnected by microglia and neurons [81,82]. The BBB is an obstacle to transporting many therapeutic molecules into and out of the brain [83]. More than 90% of small molecules and approximately 100% of large therapeutics are prohibited from crossing the BBB [80]. Additionally, those few therapeutic agents capable of permeating the BBB may be actively transported back into the blood vasculature via efflux transporters, such as P-gp [84]. Furthermore, metabolic degradation in the brain may reduce the accumulation of drugs in the brain [85]. \n\nAs a drug carrier, liposomes are considered an excellent candidate for crossing the BBB due to their structural resemblance with the lipid bilayer of the endothelial cell membrane [86]. The outer surface of liposomes can also be modified to extend their circulation time in the blood, thus enhancing the time available to penetrate the brain [87].",

            "text": "5][86] Many angiogenesis inhibitors, including those recently discovered, are limited when their clinical potential is considered. There is, therefore, an increased need for the novel approaches offered by nanotechnology and polymer chemistry. In the future, many antiangiogenic drugs may be reformulated or improved using carriers or polymer conjugation to yield more favorable clinical properties. This will be particularly important in the case of brain tumors, as the brain represents a unique environment with barriers that make drug delivery vastly more challenging. Changing drug solubility, availability in the brain, circulating time, release kinetics or route of administration are frequently as important as drug discovery itself. Although many new challenges await the translation of these drug delivery systems, often without addressing these issues even the most promising drugs cannot be translated to clinical use. The unique cranial vessels form the blood brain barrier (BBB) limits the delivery of drugs into the brain. This is critical for chemotherapies, but less so for antiangiogenic drugs that can be effective without crossing the BBB. Polymeric drug delivery systems have been developed to improve drug properties (such as: solubility, half-life, stability, toxicity) and treat pathologies within the brain parenchyma. These delivery system can be either local (e.g., wafers, nano/micro particles, cell encapsulated capsules) or systemic (e.g., polymer conjugates, nanoparticles). The BBB is disrupted at tumor site causing high vessel leakage that leads to high interstitial fluid pressure. This results in poor accumulation of small molecule drugs, but enables passive targeting of nanoparticles at the tumor site (known as the EPR effect). Neurotoxicity represents another challenge for antiangiogenic and anticancer drugs, though this may be overcome by enlarging molecular size of the drug by polymer conjugation.",

            "text": "The blood brain barrier (BBB) is a highly selective biological system that maintains brain homeostasis [1]. Due to its high efficiency, the BBB prevents 99% of currently available small molecules (> 400 Da) and all large molecule drugs from crossing the BBB [2]. This hinders clinical treatment of neurological diseases and disorders, as well as development of novel drugs to treat the aforementioned diseases [3], [4]. Current techniques for drug delivery through the BBB are either invasive and localized or non-invasive with regionally nonspecific delivery [5], [6], [7]. An optimal system for trans-BBB drug delivery would be non-invasive, have high regional specificity and be reproducible without permanent long-term neurological effects. \n\nOur group and others have shown over the past decade that focused ultrasound (FUS) with microbubbles (MB) is an effective technique to open the BBB for multiple in vivo animal models [8], [9], [10], [11]. This technique is performed noninvasively and the opening closes within hours to days depending on the acoustic pressure used [12], [13]. FUS mediated BBB opening has been shown to be effective for facilitating drugs such as doxorubicin to treat tumors and assist delivery of other small molecules (gold nanoparticles, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, adeno-associated virus) across the BBB [14], [15], [16], [17]. FUS with MB is a promising technique for targeted drug delivery in the central nervous system, but before clinical application of this technique in humans can occur, the long term effects of the technique on behavioral and cognitive function must be further investigated. \n\nThe introduction of MB coupled with lower-pressure FUS has been shown not to damage tissue or cause neurological deficits in mice [18], [19]. Our group and others have shown that for specific parameters the FUS with MB procedure can be safe for non-human primates (NHP) [20], [21].",

            "text": "Infrequently considered obstacles to CNS drug delivery include metabolism and degradation, the dilution effects caused by systemic distribution, and drug clearance in the peripheral organs. When injected into the systemic blood circulation, these lipophilic substances more quickly pass into all other tissues in the body since the strategy of enhancing the lipophilicity of therapeutic agents has been employed to improve their permeability in the CNS [71]. With increased systemic distribution, a higher dosage is necessary to obtain therapeutic concentration in the brain. This results in systemic effects that are not targeted and increased systemic toxicity. The administration of drugs poses a significant challenge due to the limited availability of medication that can freely diffuse into the CNS as a result of its high affinity for plasma protein binding. Even though this is typically considered to be a negligible barrier to CNS administration, it is one site where innovative drug delivery technology may have a big impact. Encapsulating the medicinal substance in a carrier alters the pharmacokinetic profile overall and prevents premature release into the systemic circulation [72].",

For brain disease imaging, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the primary imaging modalities used in the clinic for providing high spatial and temporal resolution.",

Interestingly, it is expressed in the gastrointestinal tract; however, its supposed receptor, GPR173, is predominantly found in hypothalamic areas. To date, it is unknown how peripherally secreted phoenixin-14 is able to reach its centrally located receptor. To investigate whether phoenixin is able to pass the blood\u2013brain barrier, we used an in vitro mono-culture blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) model consisting of brain capillary-like endothelial cells derived from human induced-pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC-BCECs). The passage of 1 nMol and 10 nMol of phoenixin-14 via the mono-culture was measured after 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, and 240 min using a commercial ELISA kit. The permeability coefficients (PC) of 1 nMol and 10 nMol phoenixin-14 were 0.021 \u00b1 0.003 and 0.044 \u00b1 0.013 \u00b5m/min, respectively. In comparison with the PC of solutes known to cross the BBB in vivo, those of phoenixin-14 in both concentrations are very low. Here, we show that phoenixin-14 alone is not able to cross the BBB, suggesting that the effects of peripherally secreted phoenixin-14 depend on a co-transport mechanism at the BBB in vivo. The mechanisms responsible for phoenixin-14\u2032s orexigenic property along the gut\u2013brain axis warrant further research.",

Modulation of the aniline moiety of BF2 formazanate dyes significantly enhances their abilities to cross the BBB for noninvasive brain imaging. Furthermore, the intact mouse brain imaging and dynamic dye diffusion across the BBB were monitored using these BF2 formazanate dyes in the NIR-II region.

To treat metastatic brain disease, blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) permeability is considered desirable for increasing clinical efficacy. Experimental Design: We examined the level of brain penetration for 16 irreversible and reversible EGFR-TKIs using multiple in vitro and in vivo BBB preclinical models. Results: In vitro osimertinib was the weakest substrate for human BBB efflux transporters (efflux ratio 3.2). In vivo rat free brain to free plasma ratios (Kpuu) show osimertinib has the most BBB penetrance (0.21), compared with the other TKIs (Kpuu \u2264 0.12). PET imaging in Cynomolgus macaques demonstrated osimertinib was the only TKI among those tested to achieve significant brain penetrance (Cmax %ID 1.5, brain/blood Kp 2.6). Desorption electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy images of brains from mouse PC9 macrometastases models showed osimertinib readily distributes across both healthy brain and tumor tissue. Comparison of osimertinib with the poorly BBB penetrant afatinib in a mouse PC9 model of subclinical brain metastases showed only osimertinib has a significant effect on rate of brain tumor growth. Conclusions: These preclinical studies indicate that osimertinib can achieve significant exposure in the brain compared with the other EGFR-TKIs tested and supports the ongoing clinical evaluation of osimertinib for the treatment of EGFR-mutant brain metastasis. This work also demonstrates the link between low in vitro transporter efflux ratios and increased brain penetrance in vivo supporting the use of in vitro transporter assays as an early screen in drug discovery.",

The most common causative bacteria in children and adults are Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis associated with high morbidity and mortality, while among neonates, most cases of bacterial meningitis are due to group B Streptococcus and Escherichia coli. Here we summarise our current knowledge on the strategies used by these bacterial pathogens to survive in the bloodstream, to colonise the brain vasculature and to cross the blood\u2013brain barrier.",

Such a selectively permeable barrier prevents the entry of therapeutic molecules from blood circulation to brain parenchyma. Towards enhancing the efficacy of brain tumor-selective drug delivery without perturbing the BBB integrity, nanometric drug carriers are increasingly becoming an efficient therapeutic modality in preclinical studies. Psychostimulant drugs such as amphetamine and methylated amphetamine (METH) are known to penetrate the BBB. Still, little effort has been made to exploit them in nano-drug delivery, largely due to their toxicities. Herein, for the first time, we design, synthesize, and formulate three different \u03b2-amphetaminylated cationic lipid nanoparticles. We show that the \u03b2-amphetaminylated cationic lipid nanoparticles are nontoxic and can cross the BBB presumably through active transcytosis. The BBB penetrating ability also depends on the hydrophilic-hydrophobic balance of the lipids, with hexadecyl lipid (16-BACL) nanoparticle showing maximum accumulation in the brain. The lipid nanoparticle of 16-BACL can simultaneously encapsulate paclitaxel and PDL1-siRNA. The dual drug-loaded lipid nanoparticles showed apoptosis driven cellular cytotoxicity against GL261 cells and improved the overall survivability of orthotopic glioblastoma bearing mice compared to their non-targeting counterpart. The present work describes a new class of BBB-crossing lipid nanoparticles and delineates their therapeutic promise against glioblastoma.",

Drug modification, osmotic opening of cerebral capillary endothelium, and alternative routes for administration (e.g., intracerebral delivery) have been successfully used to enhance drug transport to the CNS. The use of nanocarriers, such as liposomes and solid polymeric or lipid nanoparticles may be advantageous over the current strategies. These nanocarriers can not only mask the BBB limiting characteristics of the therapeutic drug molecule, but may also protect the drug from chemical/enzymatic degradation, and additionally provide the opportunity for sustained release characteristics. Reduction of toxicity to peripheral organs can also be achieved with these nanocarriers. This review article discusses the various barriers for drug delivery to the CNS and reviews the current state of nanocarriers for enhancing drug transport into the CNS.",

More than 25 small vesicles were prepared by lipid film hydration/extrusion to generate small unilamellar vesicles. The fluorescence marker calcein was encapsulated to mimic hydrophilic drug transport. Marker uptake by MDCK cells seems to be mediated by different mechanisms for the liposomes used. It was mainly depending on membrane fluidity and vesicle charge. Liposomes L2 with a positive charge (325 +/- 3 pmol/well) and vesicles L3 containing the helper lipid dioleylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) in their membrane (216 +/- 42 pmol/well) were taken up to the most. Selected liposomes were tested for their transcytotic transport across a MDCK monolayer. Liposomes L4 containing equimolar DOPE and octadecyl-1,1-dimethylpiperidin-1-ium-4-yl phosphate (OPP) were the most efficient vesicles for transcellular transport resulting in 808 +/- 30 pmol calcein/cm(2) in the basal medium (28.1% of total liposomal marker added). Transcytosis was positively correlated with membrane fluidity in the outer part of the bilayer, as electron paramagnetic resonance measurements revealed. We expect that an increase in membrane fluidity of vesicles should also improve the restricted transport of hydrophilic drugs across the blood-brain barrier."

Several studies have shown that exogenous Tat protein was able to translocate through the plasma membrane and to reach the nucleus to transactivate the viral genome. A region of the Tat protein centered on a cluster of basic amino acids has been assigned to this translocation activity. Recent data have demonstrated that chemical coupling of a Tat-derived peptide (extending from residues 37 to 72) to several proteins allowed their functional internalization into several cell lines or tissues. A part of this same domain can be folded in an \u03b1-helix structure with amphipathic characteristics. Such helical structures have been considered as key determinants for the uptake of several enveloped viruses by fusion or endocytosis. In the present study, we have delineated the main determinants required for Tat translocation within this sequence by synthesizing several peptides covering the Tat domain from residues 37 to 60. Unexpectedly, the domain extending from amino acid 37 to 47, which corresponds to the \u03b1-helix structure, is not required for cellular uptake and for nuclear translocation. Peptide internalization was assessed by direct labeling with fluorescein or by indirect immunofluorescence using a monoclonal antibody directed against the Tat basic cluster. Both approaches established that all peptides containing the basic domain are taken up by cells within less than 5 min at concentrations as low as 100 nm. In contrast, a peptide with a full \u03b1-helix but with a truncated basic amino acid cluster is not taken up by cells. The internalization process does not involve an endocytic pathway, as no inhibition of the uptake was observed at 4\u2009\u00b0C. Similar observations have been reported for a basic amino acid-rich peptide derived from the Antennapedia homeodomain (1). Short peptides allowing efficient translocation through the plasma membrane could be useful vectors for the intracellular delivery of various non-permeant drugs including antisense oligonucleotides and peptides of pharmacological interest.",

We demonstrate the effective passage of tail-vein-injected Tween-SPIONs across normal BBB in rats under an external magnetic field (EMF). The quantitative analyses show significant accumulation of SPIONs in the cortex near the magnet, with progressively lower accumulation in brain tissues far from the magnet. A transmission electron microscopy picture of an ultrathin section of the rat brain displays Tween-SPIONs crossing the BBB. The comparative study confirms that both the Tween-80 modification and EMF play crucial roles in the effective passage of SPIONs across the intact BBB. However, the magnetic force alone cannot drag the SPIONs coated with PEI/PEG polymers through the BBB. The results indicate the Tween-SPIONs cross the BBB via an active penetration facilitated by EMF. This work is encouraging for further study on the delivery of drug or diagnostic agents into the parenchyma of the brain for dealing with neurological disorders by using Tween-SPIONs carriers under EMF."

Drug delivery to the brain is a challenge even though there is relatively high blood \ufb02ow. There are two physiological barriers likes blood-brain barrier and blood-cerebrospinal \ufb02uid barrier which separates the brain from its blood supply controlling the transport of compounds. Many of the brain or CNS associated diseases remain untreated by effective therapies. This is not because there is a lack of candidate drugs but due to the inability of many therapeutic molecules to cross the BBB, the BCSFB or other specialized CNS barriers to reach the speci\ufb01c areas of brain. Hence there is a need in the modern approaches and present insights into using ligand conjugation and nanotechnology to target the BBB via different transport pathways and mechanisms. The field of novel drug delivery system has fully emerged and came into existence as an ideal approach of drug targeting and delivery to brain. The new approaches of drug delivery to brain help in successful transporting drugs across the BBB."

However, crossing the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) and finding the toxic aggregates among aggregates of different sizes and shapes remain a challenge. The ability of identifying early aggregates can provide a new approach to find inhibitors of the initial nucleation events correlating presenile dementia. In this study, we have prepared polyfluorene nanoparticles using chitosan as an additive, which enables it to cross BBB efficiently and employed as a highly efficient amyloid oligomer modulator. The polymer conjugate, polyfluorene\u2013chitosan (PC), shows no toxicity in MTT assay and precludes self-aggregation of A\u03b21\u201340 and human cerebrospinal fluid oligomers to final fibril formation. This modulation strategy is supported by thioflavin T assay, circular dichroism studies, atomic force microscope images, and Fourier transform infrared analysis. The polymer\u2013protein interface exhibits the presence of co-aggregates and responded with a stable optical response. The simple synthesis to get desired sizes and shapes with necessary photophysical behavior, biocompatibility, and most prominently BBB permeability makes this polymer conjugate very unique and highly attractive for modulation of amyloid oligomers selectively as well as for developing next generation nanotheranostic materials toward presenile dementia.",

EPR spectra were recorded at room temperature and the computer simulation analysis of spectra was made in order to obtain the magnetic parameters. Noncovalent labeling of proteins can give valuable information on the magnetic interaction between the label molecule and the paramagnetic center of the proteins. The relevance of this interaction can be obtained from line shape analysis: computer simulations for nonheme proteins assume a Gaussian line shape, whereas for heme proteins, a weighted sum of Lorentzian and Gaussian components is assumed. In the framework of the \"moderate jump diffusion\" model for rotational diffusion, the rotational correlation time is strongly influenced by pH, because of the electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding."

LNCs increase the concentration of drugs in the brain after oral or intravenous administration. We proposed to determine whether the drug is released from the LNC to cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) or the drug-loaded LNCs can cross the BBB to release the drug. We synthesized a Rhodamine B-polymer conjugate to prepare a fluorescent-labeled LNC formulation, and intravital microscopy was used to determine the ability of the LNCs to cross the brain barrier using different administration routes in C57BI/6 mice. A glioblastoma model was used to determine the impact of the LNC as a shuttle for treatment. After pial vessel exposure, intense fluorescence was detected inside the vessels 10 min after intravenous or 20 min after intraperitoneal injections of fluorescent-labeled LNC. The fluorescence was observed in the perivascular tissue after 30 and 60 min, respectively. Increased tissue fluorescence was detected 240 min after oral administration. The integrity of the barrier was determined during the experiments. Normal leukocyte and platelet adhesion to the vessel wall indicated that Rhodamine B-labeled LNC did not cause pial vessel alterations. After intravenous or oral administration, Rhodamine B-labeled LNC-containing co-encapsulated indomethacin and indomethacin ethyl ester exhibited similar behavior in pial vessels, being more efficient in the treatment of mice with glioblastoma than indomethacin in solution. Therefore, we demonstrated that LNCs act as drug shuttles through the BBB, delivering drugs in brain tissue with high efficiency and reducing glioblastoma after intravenous or oral administration."

This exosome-dominated traffic control system has increased understanding of many diseases, including cancer metastasis, diabetes, and HIV. In addition to the important diagnostic role, exosomes are particularly attractive for drug delivery, due to their distinctive properties in cellular information transfer and uptake. Compared to viral and non-viral synthetic systems, the natural, cell-derived exosomes exhibit intrinsic payload and bioavailability. Most importantly, exosomes easily cross biological barriers, obstacles that continue to challenge other drug delivery nanoparticle systems. Recent emerging studies have shown numerous critical roles of exosomes in many biological barriers, including the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB), blood\u2013cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB), blood\u2013lymph barrier (BlyB), blood\u2013air barrier (BAB), stromal barrier (SB), blood\u2013labyrinth barrier (BLaB), blood\u2013retinal barrier (BRB), and placental barrier (PB), which opens exciting new possibilities for using exosomes as the delivery platform. However, the systematic reviews summarizing such discoveries are still limited. This review covers state-of-the-art exosome research on crossing several important biological barriers with a focus on the current, accepted models used to explain the mechanisms of barrier crossing, including tight junctions. The potential to design and engineer exosomes to enhance delivery efficacy, leading to future applications in precision medicine and immunotherapy, is discussed.",

In this review, we explored how biological barriers are effectively overcome by non-viral systems, usually nanoparticles, to reach an efficient delivery of cargoes. Furthermore, this review contributes to the understanding of several mechanisms of cellular internalization taken by nanoparticles. Because a critical factor for nanoparticles to do this relies on the ability to escape endosomes, researchers have dedicated much effort to address this issue using different nanocarriers. Here, we present an overview of the diversity of nanovehicles explored to reach an efficient and effective delivery of both nucleic acids and proteins.

Therefore, the development of nanocarriers that possess both blood-brain barrier permeability and A\u03b2-targeting ability is of great importance for the intervention of AD. Here we constructed a biomimetic nanocarrier named apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-reconstituted high density lipoprotein nanocarrier (ANC) from recombinant ApoE and synthetic lipids to achieve the above goals. \u03b1-Mangostin (\u03b1-M), a polyphenolic agent that can inhibit the formation of A\u03b2 oligomers and fibrils and accelerate A\u03b2 cellular degradation, was used as the model drug. Compared with the control liposome, ANC demonstrated about 54-fold higher cellular uptake in brain endothelial cell line in vitro in an ApoE-dependent manner and much higher brain delivery efficiency in vivo. Confocal microscopy analysis witnessed the penetration of ANC across the brain vessels and its accumulation at the surrounding of A\u03b2 aggregates. Following the loading of \u03b1-M, the A\u03b2-binding affinity of the nanoformulation (ANC-\u03b1-M) was not reduced but even enhanced. The effect of ANC-\u03b1-M on facilitating the microglia-mediated uptake and degradation of A\u03b21-42 was enhanced by 336% and 29-fold when compared with that of the nontreated control and also much higher than that of ANC. Following intravenous administration for 2 to 4 weeks, ANC-\u03b1-M exhibited the most efficient efficacy in decreasing amyloid deposition, attenuating microgliosis, and rescuing memory defect in SAMP8 mice, an AD mouse model. Taken together, the findings of this work provided strong evidence that the ApoE-based biomimetic nanocarrier could provide a promising platform for brain drug delivery toward the treatment of AD."

The BBB is a protective barrier between the blood and brain tissue, preventing molecules from entering the central nervous system (Hersh et al., 2016). The BBB is formed through microvascular endothelial cells wrapped by tight junctions, adherens junctions, microvessels, pericytes, and astrocytes and interconnected by microglia and neurons (Neganova et al., 2022)(Quader et al., 2022). The BBB is an obstacle to transporting many therapeutic molecules into and out of the brain (Khatoon et al., 2020). More than 90% of small molecules and approximately 100% of large therapeutics are prohibited from crossing the BBB (Hersh et al., 2016). Additionally, those few therapeutic agents capable of permeating the BBB may be actively transported back into the blood vasculature via efflux transporters, such as P-gp (Tellingen et al., 2015). Furthermore, metabolic degradation in the brain may reduce the accumulation of drugs in the brain (Bree et al., 1992). \n\nAs a drug carrier, liposomes are considered an excellent candidate for crossing the BBB due to their structural resemblance with the lipid bilayer of the endothelial cell membrane (Schnyder et al., 2011). The outer surface of liposomes can also be modified to extend their circulation time in the blood, thus enhancing the time available to penetrate the brain [87].",

This complex barrier controls and limits the systemic delivery of therapeutics to the CNS. Several innovative strategies have been explored to enhance the transport of therapeutics across the BBB, each with individual advantages and disadvantages. Ongoing advances in delivery approaches that overcome the BBB are enabling more effective therapies for CNS diseases. In this review, we discuss: (1) the physiological properties of the BBB, (2) conventional strategies to enhance paracellular and transcellular transport through the BBB, (3) emerging concepts to overcome the BBB, and (4) alternative CNS drug delivery strategies that bypass the BBB entirely. Based on these exciting advances, we anticipate that in the near future, drug delivery research efforts will lead to more effective therapeutic interventions for diseases of the CNS."

Additionally, those few therapeutic agents capable of permeating the BBB may be actively transported back into the blood vasculature via efflux transporters, such as P-gp (Tellingen et al., 2015). Furthermore, metabolic degradation in the brain may reduce the accumulation of drugs in the brain (Bree et al., 1992). \n\nAs a drug carrier, liposomes are considered an excellent candidate for crossing the BBB due to their structural resemblance with the lipid bilayer of the endothelial cell membrane (Schnyder et al., 2011). The outer surface of liposomes can also be modified to extend their circulation time in the blood, thus enhancing the time available to penetrate the brain [87]."

Neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) is an important NTF during peripheral nerve regeneration which is scarce in the first few weeks of nerve defect. Exosomes are nanovesicles and have been served as promising candidate for biocarrier. In this work, NT-3 mRNA was encapsulated in adipose-derived stem cell (ADSC)-derived exosomes (Exo NT-3 ). These engineered exosomes were applied as NT-3 mRNA carrier and then were loaded in nerve guidance conduit (Exo NT-3 -NGC) to bridge rat sciatic nerve defect. Method NT-3 mRNA was encapsulated in exosomes by forcedly expression of NT-3 mRNA in the donor ADSCs. Exo NT-3 were co-cultured with SCs in vitro; after 24\u00a0h of culture, the efficiency of NT-3 mRNA delivery was evaluated by qPCR, western blotting and ELISA. Then, Exo NT-3 were loaded in alginate hydrogel to construct the nerve guidance conduits (Exo NT-3 -NGC). Exo NT-3 -NGC were implanted in vivo to reconstruct 10\u00a0mm rat sciatic nerve defect. The expression of NT-3 was measured 2\u00a0weeks after the implantation operation. The sciatic nerve functional index (SFI) was examined at 2 and 8\u00a0weeks after the operation. Moreover, the therapeutic effect of Exo NT-3 -NGC was also evaluated by morphology assay, immunofluorescence staining of regenerated nerves, function evaluation of gastrocnemius muscles after 8\u00a0weeks of implantation. Results The engineered exosomes could deliver NT-3 mRNA to the recipient cells efficiently and translated into functional protein. The constructed NGC could realize stable release of exosomes at least for 2\u00a0weeks. After NGC implantation in vivo, Exo NT-3 -NGC group significantly promote nerve regeneration and improve the function recovery of gastrocnemius muscles compared with control exosomes (Exo empty -NGC) group. Conclusion In this work, NGC was constructed to allow exosome-mediated NT-3 mRNA delivery. After Exo NT-3 -NGC implantation in vivo, the level of NT-3 could restore which enhance the nerve regeneration. Our study provide a potential approach to improve nerve regeneration."

BBB is a highly complex structure that tightly regulates the movement of ions of a limited number of small molecules and of an even more restricted number of macromolecules from the blood to the brain, protecting it from injuries and diseases. However, the BBB also significantly precludes the delivery of drugs to the brain, thus, preventing the therapy of a number of neurological disorders. As a consequence, several strategies are currently being sought after to enhance the delivery of drugs across the BBB. Within this review, the recently born strategy of brain drug delivery based on the use of nanoparticles, multifunctional drug delivery systems with size in the order of one-billionth of meters, is described. The review also includes a brief description of the structural and physiological features of the barrier and of the most utilized nanoparticles for medical use. Finally, the potential neurotoxicity of nanoparticles is discussed, and future technological approaches are described. The strong efforts to allow the translation from preclinical to concrete clinical applications are worth the economic investments."

We investigated the neurorestorative effects of exosomes derived from mouse brain endothelial cells (EC-Exo) as treatment for stroke in T2DM mice and investigated the role of miR-126 in mediating EC-Exo-derived therapeutic benefits in T2DM-stroke mice. Methods- Adult, male BKS.Cg-m+/+Leprdb/J (T2DM) mice were subjected to photothrombotic stroke model. T2DM mice were intravenously injected at 3 days after stroke with (1) PBS; (2) liposome mimic (vehicle control, 3\u00d71010); (3) EC-Exo (3\u00d71010); (4) knockdown of miR-126 in EC-Exo (miR-126-/- EC-Exo, 3\u00d71010). Behavioral and cognitive tests were performed, and mice were sacrificed at 28 days after stroke. Results- Compared with non-DM stroke mice, T2DM-stroke mice exhibit significantly decreased serum and brain tissue miR-126 expression. Endothelial cells and EC-Exo contain high levels of miR-126 compared with other cell types or exosomes derived from other types of cells, respectively (smooth muscle cells, astrocytes, and marrow stromal cells). Compared with PBS or liposome mimic treatment, EC-Exo treatment of T2DM-stroke mice significantly improves neurological and cognitive function, increases axon density, myelin density, vascular density, arterial diameter, as well as induces M2 macrophage polarization in the ischemic boundary zone. MiR-126-/- EC-Exo treatment significantly decreases miR-126 expression in serum and brain, as well as attentuates EC-Exo treatment-induced functional improvement and does not significantly increase axon and myelin density, vascular density, arterial diameter or induce M2 macrophage polarization in T2DM-stroke mice.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been shown to contribute to the progression of a variety of brain diseases including metastatic brain cancer and have been suggested as promising therapeutics and drug delivery vehicles. However, the ability of native tumor-derived EVs to breach the BBB and the mechanism(s) involved in this process remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that tumor-derived EVs can breach the intact BBB in vivo and by using state-of-the-art in vitro and in vivo models of the BBB, we have identified transcytosis as the mechanism underlying this process. Moreover, high spatiotemporal resolution microscopy demonstrated that the endothelial recycling endocytic pathway is involved in this transcellular transport. We further identify and characterize the mechanism by which tumor-derived EVs circumvent the low physiologic rate of transcytosis in the BBB by decreasing the brain endothelial expression of rab7 and increasing the efficiency of their transport. These findings identify previously unknown mechanisms by which tumor-derived EVs breach an intact BBB during the course of brain metastasis and can be leveraged to guide and inform the development of drug delivery approaches to deliver therapeutic cargoes across the BBB for treatment of a variety of brain diseases including, but not limited to, brain malignancies."

We found that biodistribution and pharmacokinetics of exosomes were significantly affected by pathophysiological conditions of sepsis compared to those of liposomes.

Transwell assays revealed that luciferase-carrying exosomes can cross a BMEC monolayer under stroke-like, inflamed conditions (TNF-\u03b1 activated) but not under normal conditions. Confocal microscopy showed that exosomes are internalized by BMECs through endocytosis, co-localize with endosomes, in effect primarily utilizing the transcellular route of crossing.

Intracellular signaling and cytokine output were determined by protein microarrays, and phenotypic changes were assessed by flow cytometry. Recall antigen testing, mixed lymphocyte reactions, and migration assays analyzed PBMC functional capacity.\n\n\nRESULTS\nProtein microarray data revealed induction of an immunosuppressive phenotype and cytokine output at high tumor-vesicle concentrations but an activated phenotype at low concentrations. T cell activation antigen expression confirmed differential activation profiles. Functional analyses revealed decreased migratory capacity of PBMCs after incubation with EVs; however, recall antigen and mixed lymphocyte tests indicated that activation capacity is still retained in EV-treated cells.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe differential effects of high and low EV concentrations dictate modulatory effects on PBMCs. These data provide a role for EVs at high concentrations for inducing selective tolerance of an immune response in a tumor setting. This suggests that lymphocytes in patients' circulation are not irreparably impaired, as previously thought, but can be rescued to augment antitumor responses."

Reducing A\u03b242 is therefore a cornerstone in causal drug development. Nevertheless, many promising substances failed in clinical trials, because reaching the target organ in vivo is difficult. The brain is protected by the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) that shields off most molecules to maintain the brain homeostasis. Brain-targeted nanoparticles are one successful tool to bypass this problem: by acting as Trojan horses they carry embedded drugs across the BBB for brain disorder treatment. Here, flurbiprofen, a \u03b3-secretase modulator, was embedded in Poly(Lactic Acid) (PLA) nanoparticles. We tested if the drug-loaded nanoparticles affected the integrity of our advanced in vitro BBB model in transendothelial electrical resistance measurements and permeability assays, and investigated the nanoparticle-cell interaction in flow cytometry and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Furthermore, we assessed the drug transport capacity by highperformance liquid \nchromatography \nand the biological efficacy of the embedded drug in an A\u03b242-detecing ELISA. We also verified the viability of the AD model cells by a cellular viability assay. After adding flurbiprofen-loaded nanoparticles to the blood compartment of a Transwell\u00ae model, the drug was detectable in the brain compartment, where it induced an A\u03b242 lowering effect. Flurbiprofen from nanoparticles crossed the BBB without impairing barrier integrity, whereas the free drug was highly cytotoxic and destroyed the barrier. Ligand coupling of \napolipoprotein \nE3 to the nanoparticles increased cellular uptake. Hence, we expect an even more pronounced A\u03b242 reducing effect for apolipoprotein-modified, flurbiprofen-loaded nanoparticles. In conclusion, we enabled transport of a hardly permeable drug across an advanced in vitro BBB model, opening opportunities in the treatment and prevention of AD and other brain disorders. Using a primary porcine BBB model that displays excellent barrier characteristics, we show that flurbiprofen-loaded nanoparticles reduce A\u03b242 burden without impairing barrier function."

One particularly intriguing mode of interaction between neurons, astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes is characterized by the release of extracellular vesicles that transport proteins, lipids, and nucleotides from one cell to another. Notably, several proteins that cause disease, including the prion protein and mutant SOD1, have been detected in glia-derived extracellular vesicles and observed to fuse with neurons and trigger pathology in vitro. Here we review the structural and functional characterization of such extracellular vesicles in neuron-glia interactions. Furthermore, we discuss possible mechanisms of extracellular vesicle biogenesis and release from activated glia and microglia, and their effects on neurons. Given that exosomes, the smallest type of extracellular vesicles, have been reported to recognize specific cellular populations and act as carriers of very specialized cargo, a thorough analysis of these vesicles may aid in their engineering in vitro and targeted delivery in vivo, opening opportunities for therapeutics.",

Intranasal delivery is a noninvasive and convenient method that rapidly targets therapeutics to the CNS, bypassing the BBB and minimizing systemic exposure. This review focuses on the current understanding of the mechanisms underlying intranasal delivery to the CNS, with a discussion of pathways from the nasal cavity to the CNS involving the olfactory and trigeminal nerves, the vasculature, the cerebrospinal fluid, and the lymphatic system. In addition to the properties of the therapeutic, deposition of the drug formulation within the nasal passages and composition of the formulation can influence the pathway a therapeutic follows into the CNS after intranasal administration. Experimental factors, such as head position, volume, and method of administration, and formulation parameters, such as pH, osmolarity, or inclusion of permeation enhancers or mucoadhesives, can influence formulation deposition within the nasal passages and pathways followed into the CNS. Significant research will be required to develop and improve current intranasal treatments and careful consideration should be given to the factors discussed in this review."

                            "The major challenge to chemotherapeutic delivery to the brain is the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The BBB is a protective barrier between the blood and brain tissue, preventing molecules from entering the central nervous system (Hersh et al., 2016). The BBB is formed through microvascular endothelial cells wrapped by tight junctions, adherens junctions, microvessels, pericytes, and astrocytes and interconnected by microglia and neurons (Neganova et al., 2022)(Quader et al., 2022). The BBB is an obstacle to transporting many therapeutic molecules into and out of the brain (Khatoon et al., 2020). More than 90% of small molecules and approximately 100% of large therapeutics are prohibited from crossing the BBB (Hersh et al., 2016). Additionally, those few therapeutic agents capable of permeating the BBB may be actively transported back into the blood vasculature via efflux transporters, such as P-gp (Tellingen et al., 2015). Furthermore, metabolic degradation in the brain may reduce the accumulation of drugs in the brain (Bree et al., 1992). \n\nAs a drug carrier, liposomes are considered an excellent candidate for crossing the BBB due to their structural resemblance with the lipid bilayer of the endothelial cell membrane (Schnyder et al., 2011). The outer surface of liposomes can also be modified to extend their circulation time in the blood, thus enhancing the time available to penetrate the brain [87]."

                            "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) poses a unique challenge for drug delivery to the central nervous system (CNS). The BBB consists of a continuous layer of specialized endothelial cells linked together by tight junctions, pericytes, nonfenestrated basal lamina, and astrocytic foot processes. This complex barrier controls and limits the systemic delivery of therapeutics to the CNS. Several innovative strategies have been explored to enhance the transport of therapeutics across the BBB, each with individual advantages and disadvantages. Ongoing advances in delivery approaches that overcome the BBB are enabling more effective therapies for CNS diseases. In this review, we discuss: (1) the physiological properties of the BBB, (2) conventional strategies to enhance paracellular and transcellular transport through the BBB, (3) emerging concepts to overcome the BBB, and (4) alternative CNS drug delivery strategies that bypass the BBB entirely. Based on these exciting advances, we anticipate that in the near future, drug delivery research efforts will lead to more effective therapeutic interventions for diseases of the CNS."

BBB is a highly complex structure that tightly regulates the movement of ions of a limited number of small molecules and of an even more restricted number of macromolecules from the blood to the brain, protecting it from injuries and diseases. However, the BBB also significantly precludes the delivery of drugs to the brain, thus, preventing the therapy of a number of neurological disorders. As a consequence, several strategies are currently being sought after to enhance the delivery of drugs across the BBB. Within this review, the recently born strategy of brain drug delivery based on the use of nanoparticles, multifunctional drug delivery systems with size in the order of one-billionth of meters, is described. The review also includes a brief description of the structural and physiological features of the barrier and of the most utilized nanoparticles for medical use. Finally, the potential neurotoxicity of nanoparticles is discussed, and future technological approaches are described. The strong efforts to allow the translation from preclinical to concrete clinical applications are worth the economic investments."

                            "Research has also focused on the development of polymeric nanoparticles and nanogels that can encapsulate multiple therapeutic agents and release them in a targeted, sustained manner, ensuring that higher concentrations of the drug reach the intended site of action within the brain [132](Manimaran et al., 2023)."

Regenerative medicine utilizes products of cell therapy, as well as biomedical or tissue engineering, and is a huge field for development. In regenerative medicine, stem cells and growth factor are mainly used; thus, innovative drug delivery technologies are being studied for improved delivery. Drug delivery systems offer the protection of therapeutic proteins and peptides against proteolytic degradation where controlled delivery is achievable. Similarly, the delivery systems in combination with stem cells offer improvement of cell survival, differentiation, and engraftment. The present review summarizes the significance of biomaterials in tissue engineering and the importance of colloidal drug delivery systems in providing cells with a local environment that enables them to proliferate and differentiate efficiently, resulting in successful tissue regeneration."

Polymer and lipid-based drug carriers are advantageous for delivery to the central nervous system (CNS) due to their safety profiles, drug-loading capacity, and controlled-release properties. Polymer and lipid-based nanoparticles (NPs) are reported to penetrate the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) and have been extensively assessed in in vitro and animal models of glioblastoma, epilepsy, and neurodegenerative disease. Since approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of intranasal esketamine for treatment of major depressive disorder, intranasal administration has emerged as an attractive route to bypass the BBB for drug delivery to the CNS. NPs can be specifically designed for intranasal administration by tailoring their size and coating with mucoadhesive agents or other moieties that promote transport across the nasal mucosa. In this review, unique characteristics of polymeric and lipid-based nanocarriers desirable for drug delivery to the brain are explored in addition to their potential for drug repurposing for the treatment of CNS disorders. Progress in intranasal drug delivery using polymeric and lipid-based nanostructures for the development of treatments of various neurological diseases are also described."

The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a primary physical and biological obstacle that allows only small molecules to pass through it. Its selective permeability is a significant challenge in delivering therapeutics into the brain for treating brain dysfunction. It is estimated that only 2% of the new central nervous system (CNS) therapeutic compounds can cross the BBB and achieve their therapeutic targets. Scientists are exploring various approaches to develop effective cargo delivery vehicles to promote better therapeutics targeting the brain with minimal off-target side effects. Despite different synthetic carriers, one of the natural brain cargo delivery systems, \"exosomes,\" are now employed to transport drugs through the BBB."

                            "Since the 2013 Nobel Prize was awarded for the discovery of vesicle trafficking, a subgroup of nanovesicles called exosomes has been driving the research field to a new regime for understanding cellular communication. This exosome-dominated traffic control system has increased understanding of many diseases, including cancer metastasis, diabetes, and HIV. In addition to the important diagnostic role, exosomes are particularly attractive for drug delivery, due to their distinctive properties in cellular information transfer and uptake. Compared to viral and non-viral synthetic systems, the natural, cell-derived exosomes exhibit intrinsic payload and bioavailability. Most importantly, exosomes easily cross biological barriers, obstacles that continue to challenge other drug delivery nanoparticle systems. Recent emerging studies have shown numerous critical roles of exosomes in many biological barriers, including the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB), blood\u2013cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB), blood\u2013lymph barrier (BlyB), blood\u2013air barrier (BAB), stromal barrier (SB), blood\u2013labyrinth barrier (BLaB), blood\u2013retinal barrier (BRB), and placental barrier (PB), which opens exciting new possibilities for using exosomes as the delivery platform. However, the systematic reviews summarizing such discoveries are still limited. This review covers state-of-the-art exosome research on crossing several important biological barriers with a focus on the current, accepted models used to explain the mechanisms of barrier crossing, including tight junctions. The potential to design and engineer exosomes to enhance delivery efficacy, leading to future applications in precision medicine and immunotherapy, is discussed."

These bioactive ligands can specifically bind to receptors or transporters that are highly expressed on brain endothelial cells, enhancing the targeting specificity of liposomes <Paper corpusId=\"272527281\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.

The BBB is a protective barrier between the blood and brain tissue, preventing molecules from entering the central nervous system (Hersh et al., 2016). The BBB is formed through microvascular endothelial cells wrapped by tight junctions, adherens junctions, microvessels, pericytes, and astrocytes and interconnected by microglia and neurons (Neganova et al., 2022)(Quader et al., 2022). The BBB is an obstacle to transporting many therapeutic molecules into and out of the brain (Khatoon et al., 2020). More than 90% of small molecules and approximately 100% of large therapeutics are prohibited from crossing the BBB (Hersh et al., 2016). Additionally, those few therapeutic agents capable of permeating the BBB may be actively transported back into the blood vasculature via efflux transporters, such as P-gp (Tellingen et al., 2015). Furthermore, metabolic degradation in the brain may reduce the accumulation of drugs in the brain (Bree et al., 1992). \n\nAs a drug carrier, liposomes are considered an excellent candidate for crossing the BBB due to their structural resemblance with the lipid bilayer of the endothelial cell membrane (Schnyder et al., 2011). The outer surface of liposomes can also be modified to extend their circulation time in the blood, thus enhancing the time available to penetrate the brain [87]."

                            "Tat is an 86-amino acid protein involved in the replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Several studies have shown that exogenous Tat protein was able to translocate through the plasma membrane and to reach the nucleus to transactivate the viral genome. A region of the Tat protein centered on a cluster of basic amino acids has been assigned to this translocation activity. Recent data have demonstrated that chemical coupling of a Tat-derived peptide (extending from residues 37 to 72) to several proteins allowed their functional internalization into several cell lines or tissues. A part of this same domain can be folded in an \u03b1-helix structure with amphipathic characteristics. Such helical structures have been considered as key determinants for the uptake of several enveloped viruses by fusion or endocytosis. In the present study, we have delineated the main determinants required for Tat translocation within this sequence by synthesizing several peptides covering the Tat domain from residues 37 to 60. Unexpectedly, the domain extending from amino acid 37 to 47, which corresponds to the \u03b1-helix structure, is not required for cellular uptake and for nuclear translocation. Peptide internalization was assessed by direct labeling with fluorescein or by indirect immunofluorescence using a monoclonal antibody directed against the Tat basic cluster. Both approaches established that all peptides containing the basic domain are taken up by cells within less than 5 min at concentrations as low as 100 nm. In contrast, a peptide with a full \u03b1-helix but with a truncated basic amino acid cluster is not taken up by cells. The internalization process does not involve an endocytic pathway, as no inhibition of the uptake was observed at 4\u2009\u00b0C. Similar observations have been reported for a basic amino acid-rich peptide derived from the Antennapedia homeodomain (1). Short peptides allowing efficient translocation through the plasma membrane could be useful vectors for the intracellular delivery of various non-permeant drugs including antisense oligonucleotides and peptides of pharmacological interest."

More than 25 small vesicles were prepared by lipid film hydration/extrusion to generate small unilamellar vesicles. The fluorescence marker calcein was encapsulated to mimic hydrophilic drug transport. Marker uptake by MDCK cells seems to be mediated by different mechanisms for the liposomes used. It was mainly depending on membrane fluidity and vesicle charge. Liposomes L2 with a positive charge (325 +/- 3 pmol/well) and vesicles L3 containing the helper lipid dioleylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) in their membrane (216 +/- 42 pmol/well) were taken up to the most. Selected liposomes were tested for their transcytotic transport across a MDCK monolayer. Liposomes L4 containing equimolar DOPE and octadecyl-1,1-dimethylpiperidin-1-ium-4-yl phosphate (OPP) were the most efficient vesicles for transcellular transport resulting in 808 +/- 30 pmol calcein/cm(2) in the basal medium (28.1% of total liposomal marker added). Transcytosis was positively correlated with membrane fluidity in the outer part of the bilayer, as electron paramagnetic resonance measurements revealed. We expect that an increase in membrane fluidity of vesicles should also improve the restricted transport of hydrophilic drugs across the blood-brain barrier."

                            "Lipid nanocapsules emerge as a versatile platform to tackle those barriers, and efficiently delivery different drug payloads due to their numerous advantages. They can be produced in a fast, solvent-free and scalable-up process, and their properties can be fine-tuned for to make an optimal brain drug delivery vehicle. Moreover, lipid nanocapsule surface modification can further improve their bioavailability towards the central nervous system. Coupling these features with alternative delivery methods that stem to disrupt or fully circumvent the blood-brain barrier may fully harness the therapeutic advance that lipid nanocapsules can supply to current treatment options (Moura et al., 2020). Surfactants are also employed to increase brain targeting. Commonly used surfactants like polysorbate 80 (PS 80 or Tween 80) and poloxamer 188 can induce the adsorption of proteins from the bloodstream that interact directly with receptors and transporters on the BBB surface (Feng et al., 2019)."

LNCs increase the concentration of drugs in the brain after oral or intravenous administration. We proposed to determine whether the drug is released from the LNC to cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) or the drug-loaded LNCs can cross the BBB to release the drug. We synthesized a Rhodamine B-polymer conjugate to prepare a fluorescent-labeled LNC formulation, and intravital microscopy was used to determine the ability of the LNCs to cross the brain barrier using different administration routes in C57BI/6 mice. A glioblastoma model was used to determine the impact of the LNC as a shuttle for treatment. After pial vessel exposure, intense fluorescence was detected inside the vessels 10 min after intravenous or 20 min after intraperitoneal injections of fluorescent-labeled LNC. The fluorescence was observed in the perivascular tissue after 30 and 60 min, respectively. Increased tissue fluorescence was detected 240 min after oral administration. The integrity of the barrier was determined during the experiments. Normal leukocyte and platelet adhesion to the vessel wall indicated that Rhodamine B-labeled LNC did not cause pial vessel alterations. After intravenous or oral administration, Rhodamine B-labeled LNC-containing co-encapsulated indomethacin and indomethacin ethyl ester exhibited similar behavior in pial vessels, being more efficient in the treatment of mice with glioblastoma than indomethacin in solution. Therefore, we demonstrated that LNCs act as drug shuttles through the BBB, delivering drugs in brain tissue with high efficiency and reducing glioblastoma after intravenous or oral administration."

                            "In numerous neurodegenerative diseases, the interplay between neurons and glia modulates the outcome and progression of pathology. One particularly intriguing mode of interaction between neurons, astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes is characterized by the release of extracellular vesicles that transport proteins, lipids, and nucleotides from one cell to another. Notably, several proteins that cause disease, including the prion protein and mutant SOD1, have been detected in glia-derived extracellular vesicles and observed to fuse with neurons and trigger pathology in vitro. Here we review the structural and functional characterization of such extracellular vesicles in neuron-glia interactions. Furthermore, we discuss possible mechanisms of extracellular vesicle biogenesis and release from activated glia and microglia, and their effects on neurons. Given that exosomes, the smallest type of extracellular vesicles, have been reported to recognize specific cellular populations and act as carriers of very specialized cargo, a thorough analysis of these vesicles may aid in their engineering in vitro and targeted delivery in vivo, opening opportunities for therapeutics."

Their cargo, composed of a vast diversity of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, supports the EVs\u2019 inter-cellular communication. The role of EVs in many cellular processes is now well documented both in physiological and pathological conditions. In this review, we focus on the role of EVs in the central nervous system (CNS) in physiological as well as pathological conditions such as neurodegenerative diseases or brain cancers. We also discuss the future of EVs in clinical research, in particular, their value as biomarkers as well as innovative therapeutic agents. While an increasing number of studies reveal EV research as a promising field, progress in the standardization of protocols and innovation in analysis as well as in research tools is needed to make a breakthrough in our understanding of their impact in the pathophysiology of the brain."

                "text": "\nNanoparticles (NPs) have emerged as effective carriers for drug delivery across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) due to their small size and versatile physicochemical properties. Various types of nanoparticle systems have been investigated for CNS drug delivery, including polymeric nanoparticles, solid lipid nanoparticles, and iron oxide nanoparticles <Paper corpusId=\"14855413\" paperTitle=\"(Koklic et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper>. The ability of these nanocarriers to mask the BBB-limiting characteristics of therapeutic drug molecules while protecting them from chemical and enzymatic degradation makes them particularly valuable for CNS drug delivery <Paper corpusId=\"25018911\" paperTitle=\"(Tiwari et al., 2006)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nA key advantage of nanoparticle-based systems is their ability to transport antimicrobial agents across the BBB. For instance, a single oral administration of polylactide-co-glycolide nanoparticles encapsulating antituberculosis drugs (rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol) was shown to cross the BBB in mice and sustain drug levels in the brain for up to 9 days <Paper corpusId=\"1631909\" paperTitle=\"(Yah et al._1, 2015)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"16052590\" paperTitle=\"(Pandey et al., 2006)\" isShortName></Paper>. This approach is particularly valuable for treating brain infections, which are traditionally difficult to address due to the limited penetration of most antimicrobial agents through the BBB <Paper corpusId=\"256373280\" paperTitle=\"(Yah et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"14947610\" paperTitle=\"(Masserini, 2013)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe size of nanoparticles is critical for BBB penetration, with particles under 100 nm showing enhanced ability to diffuse across the BBB via adsorptive-mediated transcytosis or nonspecific interactions <Paper corpusId=\"274701961\" paperTitle=\"(Toader et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. Physical and chemical features of nanoparticles determine their path across the BBB, with functionalized NPs capable of targeting specific transport mechanisms in brain capillary endothelial cells <Paper corpusId=\"246189487\" paperTitle=\"(Bhattacharya et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. Endocytosis and transcytosis are key mechanisms by which nanoparticles can cross the BBB, allowing drug-conjugated NPs to enter the central nervous system <Paper corpusId=\"246189487\" paperTitle=\"(Bhattacharya et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nSurface modifications play a crucial role in enhancing nanoparticle transport across the BBB. Iron oxide nanoparticles modified with PEG, PEI, and surfactants like Tween 80, along with an applied magnetic field, have demonstrated active penetration of the BBB in vivo <Paper corpusId=\"220365771\" paperTitle=\"(Gauger et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"206420944\" paperTitle=\"(Huang et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>. Other polymer-based surfactants such as Brij-35, Pluronic F68, and Vitamin E-TPGS have also shown improved passage through the BBB, allowing access to brain tumors like glioblastoma <Paper corpusId=\"220365771\" paperTitle=\"(Gauger et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nNovel approaches include \u03b2-amphetaminylated cationic lipid nanoparticles, which can cross the BBB through active transcytosis without exhibiting the toxicity associated with psychostimulant drugs <Paper corpusId=\"216131322\" paperTitle=\"(Saha et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. Additionally, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNPs) have been designed to encapsulate drugs and cross the BBB, providing effective transport and release of therapeutics to their targets <Paper corpusId=\"225563049\" paperTitle=\"(Ortega et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nSimple surface coatings can also facilitate BBB crossing by attracting plasma proteins that enhance uptake at the BBB. For example, coating nanoparticles with poloxamer 188 during the lyophilization process has shown excellent uptake in bEnd.3 cells and dopaminergic neurons derived from differentiated LUHMES cells <Paper corpusId=\"269355009\" paperTitle=\"(Danz et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"59148222\" paperTitle=\"(Stab et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>. This approach presents a less time-consuming method for targeting nanoparticles to the brain while maintaining their drug transport capabilities.\n\nAnother innovative approach involves polymer-derived extracellular vesicles (PDVEs), which can transport drugs through biological barriers, including the BBB, and improve drug bioavailability. For example, PDVEs derived from Allium tuberosum have been used to encapsulate dexamethasone, showing high efficiency in crossing the BBB and delivering the drug directly to affected brain regions <Paper corpusId=\"265332428\" paperTitle=\"(Zhao et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nCombining nanoparticles with physical methods has also shown promise. Poly(butylcyanoacrylate)-based microbubbles encased in ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles have demonstrated the ability to mediate and monitor BBB permeability in mouse models <Paper corpusId=\"248329736\" paperTitle=\"(Chong et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. This approach highlights the potential for multimodal strategies that both facilitate drug delivery across the BBB and provide real-time monitoring of the process.",

The NPs can potentially carry and potentially deliver antimicrobial across the blood brain barrier. In fact, it is known that NPs have very small nanosizes that exhibit vast physiochemical multifunctional properties that play a significant role of crossing the blood brain barrier with ease. These features of being able to transiting difficult biological system with ease without disrupting or damaging the cell membranes and sustaining the antimicrobials have made NPs and/or nanomaterials (nano-functionalizedligands) very attractive for biomedical applications (Ngoy et al., 2011)(Pandey et al., 2006). For example, a single oral administration of polylactide-co-glycolide NP-encapsulated antituberculosis drugs consisting of rifampicin + isoniazid + pyrazinamide + ethambutol conjugate in murine mice was found to cross the blood brain barrier and sustained for 9 days in the brain [86]."

This is due to the fact that the brain is made up of complex cell networks that filter foreign materials, protect and prevent the brain from injuries and diseases (Masserini, 2013)",

The NPs can potentially carry and potentially deliver antimicrobial across the blood brain barrier. In fact, it is known that NPs have very small nanosizes that exhibit vast physiochemical multifunctional properties that play a significant role of crossing the blood brain barrier with ease",

                            "The central nervous system, one of the most delicate microenvironments of the body, is protected by the blood-brain barrier (BBB) regulating its homeostasis. BBB is a highly complex structure that tightly regulates the movement of ions of a limited number of small molecules and of an even more restricted number of macromolecules from the blood to the brain, protecting it from injuries and diseases. However, the BBB also significantly precludes the delivery of drugs to the brain, thus, preventing the therapy of a number of neurological disorders. As a consequence, several strategies are currently being sought after to enhance the delivery of drugs across the BBB. Within this review, the recently born strategy of brain drug delivery based on the use of nanoparticles, multifunctional drug delivery systems with size in the order of one-billionth of meters, is described. The review also includes a brief description of the structural and physiological features of the barrier and of the most utilized nanoparticles for medical use. Finally, the potential neurotoxicity of nanoparticles is discussed, and future technological approaches are described. The strong efforts to allow the translation from preclinical to concrete clinical applications are worth the economic investments."

NPs under 100 nm with optimized surface properties, such as lipophilic coatings or PEGylation, can diffuse across the BBB via adsorptive-mediated transcytosis or nonspecific interactions (Vargas et al., 2024). Lipid NPs, including liposomes and solid lipid NPs (SLNs), excel in this domain due to their stability and ability to encapsulate both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs.

Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) coated with PEG (poly(ethylene glycol)), PEI (poly(ethylene imine)), and Tween 80 (polysorbate 80) (Tween-SPIONs) were prepared. We demonstrate the effective passage of tail-vein-injected Tween-SPIONs across normal BBB in rats under an external magnetic field (EMF). The quantitative analyses show significant accumulation of SPIONs in the cortex near the magnet, with progressively lower accumulation in brain tissues far from the magnet. A transmission electron microscopy picture of an ultrathin section of the rat brain displays Tween-SPIONs crossing the BBB. The comparative study confirms that both the Tween-80 modification and EMF play crucial roles in the effective passage of SPIONs across the intact BBB. However, the magnetic force alone cannot drag the SPIONs coated with PEI/PEG polymers through the BBB. The results indicate the Tween-SPIONs cross the BBB via an active penetration facilitated by EMF. This work is encouraging for further study on the delivery of drug or diagnostic agents into the parenchyma of the brain for dealing with neurological disorders by using Tween-SPIONs carriers under EMF."

                            "Towards enhancing the efficacy of brain tumor-selective drug delivery without perturbing the BBB integrity, nanometric drug carriers are increasingly becoming an efficient therapeutic modality in preclinical studies. Psychostimulant drugs such as amphetamine and methylated amphetamine (METH) are known to penetrate the BBB. Still, little effort has been made to exploit them in nano-drug delivery, largely due to their toxicities. Herein, for the first time, we design, synthesize, and formulate three different \u03b2-amphetaminylated cationic lipid nanoparticles. We show that the \u03b2-amphetaminylated cationic lipid nanoparticles are nontoxic and can cross the BBB presumably through active transcytosis."

                            "Reaching the brain is one of the most challenging endeavours due to the high selectivity of the bloodbrain barrier (Davson, 1977).The most promising avenues involve surface modifications targeting the specific transport mechanisms most prevalent in the brain capillary endothelial cells, be it receptor-or transporter-mediated transport (Leyva-G\u00f3mez et al., 2015).To achieve this, specific substances, peptides or proteins that are recognised by these processes have to be present on the nanoparticle surface.While the direct linking of these substances to the particle surface is widely used (Silva et al., 2019)43,(Huang et al., 2013), simpler surface coatings are also able to attract plasma proteins, which will then facilitate the uptake at the blood-brain barrier (Gelperina et al., 2010)(Stab et al., 2016).This shortens the nanoparticle production process and thus allows fewer possibilities to lose some amount of the encapsulated dopamine at each of the steps.The nanoparticles used here, with a simple surface coating of poloxamer 188 introduced during the lyophilisation process, present the least time-consuming and easiest method of targeting the nanoparticles to the brain.The success of this strategy has been shown by the excellent uptake values in the bEnd.3 cells as a simple model system and the still high uptake even in the dopaminergic neurons derived from differentiated LUHMES cells.Successful transport of the contained dopamine could be shown in an advanced blood-brain barrier model using brain capillary endothelial cells derived from hiPS cells, as discussed above."

                            "Elevated amyloid-\u03b242 (A\u03b242) in the brain is expected to cause \nAlzheimer\u2019s Disease \n(AD). Reducing A\u03b242 is therefore a cornerstone in causal drug development. Nevertheless, many promising substances failed in clinical trials, because reaching the target organ in vivo is difficult. The brain is protected by the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) that shields off most molecules to maintain the brain homeostasis. Brain-targeted nanoparticles are one successful tool to bypass this problem: by acting as Trojan horses they carry embedded drugs across the BBB for brain disorder treatment. Here, flurbiprofen, a \u03b3-secretase modulator, was embedded in Poly(Lactic Acid) (PLA) nanoparticles. We tested if the drug-loaded nanoparticles affected the integrity of our advanced in vitro BBB model in transendothelial electrical resistance measurements and permeability assays, and investigated the nanoparticle-cell interaction in flow cytometry and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Furthermore, we assessed the drug transport capacity by highperformance liquid \nchromatography \nand the biological efficacy of the embedded drug in an A\u03b242-detecing ELISA. We also verified the viability of the AD model cells by a cellular viability assay. After adding flurbiprofen-loaded nanoparticles to the blood compartment of a Transwell\u00ae model, the drug was detectable in the brain compartment, where it induced an A\u03b242 lowering effect. Flurbiprofen from nanoparticles crossed the BBB without impairing barrier integrity, whereas the free drug was highly cytotoxic and destroyed the barrier. Ligand coupling of \napolipoprotein \nE3 to the nanoparticles increased cellular uptake. Hence, we expect an even more pronounced A\u03b242 reducing effect for apolipoprotein-modified, flurbiprofen-loaded nanoparticles. In conclusion, we enabled transport of a hardly permeable drug across an advanced in vitro BBB model, opening opportunities in the treatment and prevention of AD and other brain disorders. Using a primary porcine BBB model that displays excellent barrier characteristics, we show that flurbiprofen-loaded nanoparticles reduce A\u03b242 burden without impairing barrier function."

                            "When administered orally, most drugs are unable to enter the bloodstream because of the intestinal barrier. When treating brainrelated diseases, drugs have difficulties entering the brain due to the blood-brain barrier and instead reach other organs, leading to potentially severe side effects. (Langen et al., 2019) Based on the phospholipid surface and nanostructure, PDVEs can transport a drug through a biological barrier and improve the bioavailability of the drug. \n\nOne prominent example showcasing the potential of PDVEs in surmounting biological barriers is their application in delivering dexamethasone (Dex) for neuroinflammation-related disease treatment. Dex is known for its anti-inflammatory properties, but its therapeutic potential is limited due to its poor bioavailability and inability to cross the blood-brain barrier efficiently. Researchers utilized Allium tuberosum-derived PDVEs to encapsulate Dex. Upon administration, these PDVEs were shown high efficiency in crossing the blood-brain barrier, and delivered Dex directly to the affected brain regions."

Research suggests that brain microvascular endothelial cells internalize and transport exosomes across the BBB through endocytosis, with only a small portion crossing via the paracellular pathway <Paper corpusId=\"276534368\" paperTitle=\"(Quan et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"237503305\" paperTitle=\"(Xu et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. High-resolution microscopy has demonstrated that the endothelial recycling endocytic pathway is involved in this transcellular transport <Paper corpusId=\"201831379\" paperTitle=\"(Morad et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nInterestingly, exosomes derived from different parent cells exhibit varying tropisms for organs and tissues <Paper corpusId=\"267847345\" paperTitle=\"(Yang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. For example, neural-stem-cell-derived extracellular vesicles have demonstrated enhanced central nervous system distribution compared to those derived from mesenchymal stem cells in a mouse stroke model <Paper corpusId=\"267847345\" paperTitle=\"(Yang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"9850133\" paperTitle=\"(Hellwinkel et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>.

In one study, dendritic cell-derived exosomes were engineered to express the exosome membrane protein LAMP2B fused with neuron-specific RVG peptides. These modified exosomes successfully delivered siRNA targeting BACE1, a crucial regulatory gene in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis, to the brain of mice after intravenous injection <Paper corpusId=\"250363831\" paperTitle=\"(Su, 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.

Designing engineered exosomes with surface-modified targeting peptides represents an effective strategy for achieving specific brain targeting <Paper corpusId=\"258791576\" paperTitle=\"(Zeng et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.

                            "The human brain is protected by the complex and selective blood-brain barrier (BBB), which prevents the entry of most small-molecule drugs and almost all large-molecule therapeutic drugs, thereby, posing a major obstacle to intracerebral drug delivery (Pandit et al., 2019). However, studies have shown that exosomes derived from various brain cell types (brain endothelial cells (Venkat et al., 2019), microglia (Ge et al., 2019), astrocytes (He et al., 2023), and choroid plexus epithelial cells (Pauwels et al., 2022)) and those originating from metastatic brain tumor (Morad et al., 2019) can target the brain to varying extents. Designing engineered exosomes with surface-modified targeting peptides represents an effective strategy for achieving brain targeting [118]."

Because of their special properties, including low toxicity and immunogenicity, biodegradability, ability to encapsulate endogenous biologically active molecules and cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), exosomes have great therapeutic potential in cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. However, the poor targeting ability of natural exosomes greatly reduces the therapeutic effect. Using engineering technology, exosomes can obtain active targeting ability to accumulate in specific cell types and tissues by attaching targeting units to the membrane surface or loading them into cavities. In this review, we outline the improved targeting functions of bioengineered exosomes, tracing and imaging techniques, administration methods, internalization in the BBB, and therapeutic effects of exosomes in cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative diseases and further evaluate the clinical opportunities and challenges in this research field."

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been shown to contribute to the progression of a variety of brain diseases including metastatic brain cancer and have been suggested as promising therapeutics and drug delivery vehicles. However, the ability of native tumor-derived EVs to breach the BBB and the mechanism(s) involved in this process remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that tumor-derived EVs can breach the intact BBB in vivo and by using state-of-the-art in vitro and in vivo models of the BBB, we have identified transcytosis as the mechanism underlying this process. Moreover, high spatiotemporal resolution microscopy demonstrated that the endothelial recycling endocytic pathway is involved in this transcellular transport. We further identify and characterize the mechanism by which tumor-derived EVs circumvent the low physiologic rate of transcytosis in the BBB by decreasing the brain endothelial expression of rab7 and increasing the efficiency of their transport. These findings identify previously unknown mechanisms by which tumor-derived EVs breach an intact BBB during the course of brain metastasis and can be leveraged to guide and inform the development of drug delivery approaches to deliver therapeutic cargoes across the BBB for treatment of a variety of brain diseases including, but not limited to, brain malignancies."

(Mirzaaghasi et al., 2021) Recent research indicates that exosomes derived from different parent cells exhibit varying tropisms for organs and tissues (Hellwinkel et al., 2016). For example, neural-stem-cellderived EVs demonstrated enhanced CNS distribution compared to mesenchymal-stemcell-derived EVs in a mouse stroke model [44]. Furthermore, under specific pathological conditions, such as brain inflammation or tumors, there is a notable enhancement in exosome transport across the blood-brain barrier (Chen et al., 2016)(Xu et al., 2018). In mice with brain inflammation, exosomes derived from macrophages demonstrated more than a three-fold increase in delivery to the brain compared to those in normal mice (Yuan et al., 2017)."

                            "BACKGROUND\nGlioma-related immunosuppression is well documented; however, the mechanisms of suppression are not fully understood. Here we explore a role for glioma extracellular vesicles (EVs) as a means of immune modulation.\n\n\nMETHODS\nHealthy donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were incubated with mitogenic stimuli and various concentrations of glioma-derived EVs. Intracellular signaling and cytokine output were determined by protein microarrays, and phenotypic changes were assessed by flow cytometry. Recall antigen testing, mixed lymphocyte reactions, and migration assays analyzed PBMC functional capacity.\n\n\nRESULTS\nProtein microarray data revealed induction of an immunosuppressive phenotype and cytokine output at high tumor-vesicle concentrations but an activated phenotype at low concentrations. T cell activation antigen expression confirmed differential activation profiles. Functional analyses revealed decreased migratory capacity of PBMCs after incubation with EVs; however, recall antigen and mixed lymphocyte tests indicated that activation capacity is still retained in EV-treated cells.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe differential effects of high and low EV concentrations dictate modulatory effects on PBMCs. These data provide a role for EVs at high concentrations for inducing selective tolerance of an immune response in a tumor setting. This suggests that lymphocytes in patients' circulation are not irreparably impaired, as previously thought, but can be rescued to augment antitumor responses."

                            "The delivery of therapeutics to the central nervous system remains a major challenge in part due to the presence of the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB). Recently, cell-derived vesicles, particularly exosomes, have emerged as an attractive vehicle for targeting drugs to the brain, but whether or how they cross the BBB remains unclear. Here, we investigated the interactions between exosomes and brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) in vitro under conditions that mimic the healthy and inflamed BBB in vivo. Transwell assays revealed that luciferase-carrying exosomes can cross a BMEC monolayer under stroke-like, inflamed conditions (TNF-\u03b1 activated) but not under normal conditions. Confocal microscopy showed that exosomes are internalized by BMECs through endocytosis, co-localize with endosomes, in effect primarily utilizing the transcellular route of crossing. Together, these results indicate that cell-derived exosomes can cross the BBB model under stroke-like conditions in vitro. This study encourages further development of engineered exosomes as drug delivery vehicles or tracking tools for treating or monitoring neurological diseases."

The purified DC exosomes contained exogenous siRNA targeting BACE1, a crucial regulatory gene in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease; these exosomes were injected intravenously into mice (Daneshmandi et al., 2020). These exosomes specifically enter the neurons, microglia, and oligodendrocytes in the brain, leading to the knockdown of the BACE1 gene in the mouse model. This study proves the feasibility of specific systemic delivery of exosomes. More importantly, the study shows that exosomes can pass through biological barriers, indicating the possibility of RNAibased treatment of new brain tumors and brain metastases (Stewart et al., 2003)(Daneshmandi et al., 2020)[43]."

                            "Biological barriers are one of the most efficient apparatuses for organs and tissues' protection against pathogens and diseases.Some examples can be mentioned: blood-brain barrier (BBB), stromal barrier, placental barrier, and blood-air barrier, among others.Nonetheless, when an organ or tissue protected by these barriers gets sick, it is challenging to deliver drugs, even for nanometric vesicles (Choudhury et al., 2021)(Elliott et al., 2021)(Torres-Vanegas et al., 2021).No doubt, crossing the blood-brain barrier is one of the major challenges faced by modern drug delivery systems and pharmacology.\n\nIn recent studies, biomimetic nanovesicles are being explored as candidates to cross the blood-brain barrier.Engineered or not, small extracellular vesicles are the most common vesicles employed to this aim, probably because of their endogenous origin.\n\nSmall extracellular vesicles derived from macrophages were used as a carrier to cross the blood-brain barrier in mice models.The nanovesicles were loaded with a protein cargo, the brain-derived neurotrophic factor, by simple incubation.This was possible since cargo and carrier have electrostatic attraction.Even though a small fraction of the injected dose (0.093 \u00b1 0.02 %D/g brain -0.538 \u00b1 0.315 %ID/g brain), the study showed that small extracellular vesicles are candidates for brain drug delivery systems (Yuan et al., 2017).\n\nA liposome containing an isolated protein, apolipoprotein E (ApoE), was used as a carrier to deliver \u03b1-mangostin in vivo.The nanoparticle was synthesized by thin-film hydration method followed by sonication, and the drug was loaded during this process.Fluorescent imaging analysis showed a higher signal in mice brain when compared to the control (Song et al., 2016).\n\nVirus-inspired nanocarriers can cross the blood-brain barrier, especially as a gene delivery system.Viruses like Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), lentivirus, adenovirus, and adeno-associated virus were used as vectors for drug and gene delivery (Gray et al., 2010)."

                            "Amyloid beta (A\u03b2) and its aggregation forms in the brain have been suggested as key targets for the therapy of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, the development of nanocarriers that possess both blood-brain barrier permeability and A\u03b2-targeting ability is of great importance for the intervention of AD. Here we constructed a biomimetic nanocarrier named apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-reconstituted high density lipoprotein nanocarrier (ANC) from recombinant ApoE and synthetic lipids to achieve the above goals. \u03b1-Mangostin (\u03b1-M), a polyphenolic agent that can inhibit the formation of A\u03b2 oligomers and fibrils and accelerate A\u03b2 cellular degradation, was used as the model drug. Compared with the control liposome, ANC demonstrated about 54-fold higher cellular uptake in brain endothelial cell line in vitro in an ApoE-dependent manner and much higher brain delivery efficiency in vivo. Confocal microscopy analysis witnessed the penetration of ANC across the brain vessels and its accumulation at the surrounding of A\u03b2 aggregates. Following the loading of \u03b1-M, the A\u03b2-binding affinity of the nanoformulation (ANC-\u03b1-M) was not reduced but even enhanced. The effect of ANC-\u03b1-M on facilitating the microglia-mediated uptake and degradation of A\u03b21-42 was enhanced by 336% and 29-fold when compared with that of the nontreated control and also much higher than that of ANC. Following intravenous administration for 2 to 4 weeks, ANC-\u03b1-M exhibited the most efficient efficacy in decreasing amyloid deposition, attenuating microgliosis, and rescuing memory defect in SAMP8 mice, an AD mouse model. Taken together, the findings of this work provided strong evidence that the ApoE-based biomimetic nanocarrier could provide a promising platform for brain drug delivery toward the treatment of AD."

                            "In numerous neurodegenerative diseases, the interplay between neurons and glia modulates the outcome and progression of pathology. One particularly intriguing mode of interaction between neurons, astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes is characterized by the release of extracellular vesicles that transport proteins, lipids, and nucleotides from one cell to another. Notably, several proteins that cause disease, including the prion protein and mutant SOD1, have been detected in glia-derived extracellular vesicles and observed to fuse with neurons and trigger pathology in vitro. Here we review the structural and functional characterization of such extracellular vesicles in neuron-glia interactions. Furthermore, we discuss possible mechanisms of extracellular vesicle biogenesis and release from activated glia and microglia, and their effects on neurons. Given that exosomes, the smallest type of extracellular vesicles, have been reported to recognize specific cellular populations and act as carriers of very specialized cargo, a thorough analysis of these vesicles may aid in their engineering in vitro and targeted delivery in vivo, opening opportunities for therapeutics."

                            "Tat is an 86-amino acid protein involved in the replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Several studies have shown that exogenous Tat protein was able to translocate through the plasma membrane and to reach the nucleus to transactivate the viral genome. A region of the Tat protein centered on a cluster of basic amino acids has been assigned to this translocation activity. Recent data have demonstrated that chemical coupling of a Tat-derived peptide (extending from residues 37 to 72) to several proteins allowed their functional internalization into several cell lines or tissues. A part of this same domain can be folded in an \u03b1-helix structure with amphipathic characteristics. Such helical structures have been considered as key determinants for the uptake of several enveloped viruses by fusion or endocytosis. In the present study, we have delineated the main determinants required for Tat translocation within this sequence by synthesizing several peptides covering the Tat domain from residues 37 to 60. Unexpectedly, the domain extending from amino acid 37 to 47, which corresponds to the \u03b1-helix structure, is not required for cellular uptake and for nuclear translocation. Peptide internalization was assessed by direct labeling with fluorescein or by indirect immunofluorescence using a monoclonal antibody directed against the Tat basic cluster. Both approaches established that all peptides containing the basic domain are taken up by cells within less than 5 min at concentrations as low as 100 nm. In contrast, a peptide with a full \u03b1-helix but with a truncated basic amino acid cluster is not taken up by cells. The internalization process does not involve an endocytic pathway, as no inhibition of the uptake was observed at 4\u2009\u00b0C. Similar observations have been reported for a basic amino acid-rich peptide derived from the Antennapedia homeodomain (1). Short peptides allowing efficient translocation through the plasma membrane could be useful vectors for the intracellular delivery of various non-permeant drugs including antisense oligonucleotides and peptides of pharmacological interest."

                            "Reaching the brain is one of the most challenging endeavours due to the high selectivity of the bloodbrain barrier (Davson, 1977).The most promising avenues involve surface modifications targeting the specific transport mechanisms most prevalent in the brain capillary endothelial cells, be it receptor-or transporter-mediated transport (Leyva-G\u00f3mez et al., 2015).To achieve this, specific substances, peptides or proteins that are recognised by these processes have to be present on the nanoparticle surface.While the direct linking of these substances to the particle surface is widely used (Silva et al., 2019)43,(Huang et al., 2013), simpler surface coatings are also able to attract plasma proteins, which will then facilitate the uptake at the blood-brain barrier (Gelperina et al., 2010)(Stab et al., 2016).This shortens the nanoparticle production process and thus allows fewer possibilities to lose some amount of the encapsulated dopamine at each of the steps.The nanoparticles used here, with a simple surface coating of poloxamer 188 introduced during the lyophilisation process, present the least time-consuming and easiest method of targeting the nanoparticles to the brain.The success of this strategy has been shown by the excellent uptake values in the bEnd.3 cells as a simple model system and the still high uptake even in the dopaminergic neurons derived from differentiated LUHMES cells.Successful transport of the contained dopamine could be shown in an advanced blood-brain barrier model using brain capillary endothelial cells derived from hiPS cells, as discussed above."

They can be produced in a fast, solvent-free and scalable-up process, and their properties can be fine-tuned for to make an optimal brain drug delivery vehicle. Moreover, lipid nanocapsule surface modification can further improve their bioavailability towards the central nervous system. Coupling these features with alternative delivery methods that stem to disrupt or fully circumvent the blood-brain barrier may fully harness the therapeutic advance that lipid nanocapsules can supply to current treatment options (Moura et al., 2020). Surfactants are also employed to increase brain targeting. Commonly used surfactants like polysorbate 80 (PS 80 or Tween 80) and poloxamer 188 can induce the adsorption of proteins from the bloodstream that interact directly with receptors and transporters on the BBB surface (Feng et al., 2019)."

Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) coated with PEG (poly(ethylene glycol)), PEI (poly(ethylene imine)), and Tween 80 (polysorbate 80) (Tween-SPIONs) were prepared. We demonstrate the effective passage of tail-vein-injected Tween-SPIONs across normal BBB in rats under an external magnetic field (EMF). The quantitative analyses show significant accumulation of SPIONs in the cortex near the magnet, with progressively lower accumulation in brain tissues far from the magnet. A transmission electron microscopy picture of an ultrathin section of the rat brain displays Tween-SPIONs crossing the BBB. The comparative study confirms that both the Tween-80 modification and EMF play crucial roles in the effective passage of SPIONs across the intact BBB. However, the magnetic force alone cannot drag the SPIONs coated with PEI/PEG polymers through the BBB. The results indicate the Tween-SPIONs cross the BBB via an active penetration facilitated by EMF. This work is encouraging for further study on the delivery of drug or diagnostic agents into the parenchyma of the brain for dealing with neurological disorders by using Tween-SPIONs carriers under EMF."

Reducing A\u03b242 is therefore a cornerstone in causal drug development. Nevertheless, many promising substances failed in clinical trials, because reaching the target organ in vivo is difficult. The brain is protected by the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) that shields off most molecules to maintain the brain homeostasis. Brain-targeted nanoparticles are one successful tool to bypass this problem: by acting as Trojan horses they carry embedded drugs across the BBB for brain disorder treatment. Here, flurbiprofen, a \u03b3-secretase modulator, was embedded in Poly(Lactic Acid) (PLA) nanoparticles. We tested if the drug-loaded nanoparticles affected the integrity of our advanced in vitro BBB model in transendothelial electrical resistance measurements and permeability assays, and investigated the nanoparticle-cell interaction in flow cytometry and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Furthermore, we assessed the drug transport capacity by highperformance liquid \nchromatography \nand the biological efficacy of the embedded drug in an A\u03b242-detecing ELISA. We also verified the viability of the AD model cells by a cellular viability assay. After adding flurbiprofen-loaded nanoparticles to the blood compartment of a Transwell\u00ae model, the drug was detectable in the brain compartment, where it induced an A\u03b242 lowering effect. Flurbiprofen from nanoparticles crossed the BBB without impairing barrier integrity, whereas the free drug was highly cytotoxic and destroyed the barrier. Ligand coupling of \napolipoprotein \nE3 to the nanoparticles increased cellular uptake. Hence, we expect an even more pronounced A\u03b242 reducing effect for apolipoprotein-modified, flurbiprofen-loaded nanoparticles. In conclusion, we enabled transport of a hardly permeable drug across an advanced in vitro BBB model, opening opportunities in the treatment and prevention of AD and other brain disorders. Using a primary porcine BBB model that displays excellent barrier characteristics, we show that flurbiprofen-loaded nanoparticles reduce A\u03b242 burden without impairing barrier function."

                            "Passive targeting exploits the physicochemical properties of NPs to achieve BBB penetration without requiring specific interactions with receptors or transporters. NPs under 100 nm with optimized surface properties, such as lipophilic coatings or PEGylation, can diffuse across the BBB via adsorptive-mediated transcytosis or nonspecific interactions (Vargas et al., 2024). Lipid NPs, including liposomes and solid lipid NPs (SLNs), excel in this domain due to their stability and ability to encapsulate both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs. Recent advances in these systems include modifications for extended circulation and targeted release in diseased CNS regions [20]."

Modification of the polymer shell to contain abundant choline and acetylcholine analogues has been shown to deliver macromolecules to the CNS with >10-fold higher levels compared to native forms. This modification was utilised in treatment of HIV infection in the CNS of rhesus macaques. IgG1 antibody PGT121 was encapsulated via in situ polymerization of MPC as a monomer, Poly(DL-lactide)-b-Poly(ethylene glycol)-b-Poly(DL-lactide)-diacrylate triblock (A102, PLA-PEG-PLA) as a hydrolysable crosslinker, and GDMA as a degradable crosslinker. Effective transport of the nanocapsule-antibody across the BBB and into the CNS was observed (Habtemariam et al., 2020)."

This phase I, randomized, single\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled, single ascending dose study evaluated the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and safety profile of subcutaneously administered vutrisiran (5\u2013300 mg) in healthy subjects (n = 80). Vutrisiran treatment achieved potent and sustained TTR reduction in a dose\u2010dependent manner, with mean maximum TTR reduction of 57\u201397%, maintained for \u2265 90 days post dose. Vutrisiran was rapidly absorbed (peak plasma concentration 3\u20135 hours post dose), had a short plasma half\u2010life (4.2\u20137.5 hours), and plasma concentrations increased in a dose\u2010proportional manner. Pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic results were similar in Japanese and non\u2010Japanese subjects. Vutrisiran had an acceptable safety profile; the most common treatment\u2010related adverse event was mild, transient injection site reactions in four (6.7%) vutrisiran\u2010treated subjects. The favorable pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and safety results observed here support vutrisiran's continued clinical development."

                            "One way to circumvent the blood-brain barrier is direct administration of an intraparenchymal injection of the desired substance. Another is to use implantable systems, such as osmotic pumps or enhanced convention devices, for continuous drug infusion. However, surgical approaches are invasive, risky, and cannot be used when the implantable device crosses or targets critical areas of the brain. It is also possible to use such devices to perform intraventricular or intrathecal administration of drugs when involving the cerebrospinal fluid-brain barrier to avoid the blood-brain barrier. Intranasal delivery is also an emerging noninvasive alternative to bypass the blood-brain barrier and facilitates delivery of large charged therapeutic molecules into the brain. (Dhuria et al., 2010) Rather than bypassing the blood-brain barrier, it is possible to disrupt it temporarily by opening the tight junctions of endothelial cells. Under these conditions, permeability of the blood vessels in the brain to systemically applied treatments can be increased. (Gabathuler, 2010) A transient disruption of the blood-brain barrier may be achieved by: osmotic shock using mannitol, arabinose, or other hypertonic solutions; acting at specific receptors on endothelial cells with substrates that affect the tight junctions, such as bradykinin receptors; (Borlongan et al., 2003) and using magnetic resonance imaging-guided ultrasound in combination with microbubbles of contrast agents to induce focalized openings in small areas of the brain.

Intranasal delivery is a noninvasive and convenient method that rapidly targets therapeutics to the CNS, bypassing the BBB and minimizing systemic exposure. This review focuses on the current understanding of the mechanisms underlying intranasal delivery to the CNS, with a discussion of pathways from the nasal cavity to the CNS involving the olfactory and trigeminal nerves, the vasculature, the cerebrospinal fluid, and the lymphatic system. In addition to the properties of the therapeutic, deposition of the drug formulation within the nasal passages and composition of the formulation can influence the pathway a therapeutic follows into the CNS after intranasal administration. Experimental factors, such as head position, volume, and method of administration, and formulation parameters, such as pH, osmolarity, or inclusion of permeation enhancers or mucoadhesives, can influence formulation deposition within the nasal passages and pathways followed into the CNS. Significant research will be required to develop and improve current intranasal treatments and careful consideration should be given to the factors discussed in this review."

                            "Biological barriers are one of the most efficient apparatuses for organs and tissues' protection against pathogens and diseases.Some examples can be mentioned: blood-brain barrier (BBB), stromal barrier, placental barrier, and blood-air barrier, among others.Nonetheless, when an organ or tissue protected by these barriers gets sick, it is challenging to deliver drugs, even for nanometric vesicles (Choudhury et al., 2021)(Elliott et al., 2021)(Torres-Vanegas et al., 2021).No doubt, crossing the blood-brain barrier is one of the major challenges faced by modern drug delivery systems and pharmacology.\n\nIn recent studies, biomimetic nanovesicles are being explored as candidates to cross the blood-brain barrier.Engineered or not, small extracellular vesicles are the most common vesicles employed to this aim, probably because of their endogenous origin.\n\nSmall extracellular vesicles derived from macrophages were used as a carrier to cross the blood-brain barrier in mice models.The nanovesicles were loaded with a protein cargo, the brain-derived neurotrophic factor, by simple incubation.This was possible since cargo and carrier have electrostatic attraction.Even though a small fraction of the injected dose (0.093 \u00b1 0.02 %D/g brain -0.538 \u00b1 0.315 %ID/g brain), the study showed that small extracellular vesicles are candidates for brain drug delivery systems (Yuan et al., 2017).\n\nA liposome containing an isolated protein, apolipoprotein E (ApoE), was used as a carrier to deliver \u03b1-mangostin in vivo.The nanoparticle was synthesized by thin-film hydration method followed by sonication, and the drug was loaded during this process.Fluorescent imaging analysis showed a higher signal in mice brain when compared to the control (Song et al., 2016).\n\nVirus-inspired nanocarriers can cross the blood-brain barrier, especially as a gene delivery system.Viruses like Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), lentivirus, adenovirus, and adeno-associated virus were used as vectors for drug and gene delivery (Gray et al., 2010)."

There are a broad range of therapeutic targets, with very different requirements for a suitable viral vector. By utilizing different vector tropisms, novel routes of administration and engineered promoter control, transgenes can be targeted to specific therapeutic applications. Viral vectors have proven efficacious in preclinical models for several disease applications, spurring several clinical trials. While the field has pushed the limits of existing adeno-associated virus-based vectors, a next generation of vectors based on rational engineering of viral capsids should expand the application of gene therapy to be more effective in specific therapeutic applications."

                            "Amyloid beta (A\u03b2) and its aggregation forms in the brain have been suggested as key targets for the therapy of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, the development of nanocarriers that possess both blood-brain barrier permeability and A\u03b2-targeting ability is of great importance for the intervention of AD. Here we constructed a biomimetic nanocarrier named apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-reconstituted high density lipoprotein nanocarrier (ANC) from recombinant ApoE and synthetic lipids to achieve the above goals. \u03b1-Mangostin (\u03b1-M), a polyphenolic agent that can inhibit the formation of A\u03b2 oligomers and fibrils and accelerate A\u03b2 cellular degradation, was used as the model drug. Compared with the control liposome, ANC demonstrated about 54-fold higher cellular uptake in brain endothelial cell line in vitro in an ApoE-dependent manner and much higher brain delivery efficiency in vivo. Confocal microscopy analysis witnessed the penetration of ANC across the brain vessels and its accumulation at the surrounding of A\u03b2 aggregates. Following the loading of \u03b1-M, the A\u03b2-binding affinity of the nanoformulation (ANC-\u03b1-M) was not reduced but even enhanced. The effect of ANC-\u03b1-M on facilitating the microglia-mediated uptake and degradation of A\u03b21-42 was enhanced by 336% and 29-fold when compared with that of the nontreated control and also much higher than that of ANC. Following intravenous administration for 2 to 4 weeks, ANC-\u03b1-M exhibited the most efficient efficacy in decreasing amyloid deposition, attenuating microgliosis, and rescuing memory defect in SAMP8 mice, an AD mouse model. Taken together, the findings of this work provided strong evidence that the ApoE-based biomimetic nanocarrier could provide a promising platform for brain drug delivery toward the treatment of AD."
