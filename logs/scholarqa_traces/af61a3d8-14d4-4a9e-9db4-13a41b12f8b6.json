Compared to liposomes which have a lipid bilayer surrounding an aqueous core, lipid nanoparticles with a particle structure have several attractive advantages for encapsulating poorly water\u2010soluble drugs such as better stability due to the particle structure, high drug encapsulation efficiency because of a pre\u2010 or co\u2010drug\u2010loading strategy. While many studies have reported the synthesis of lipid nanoparticles for hydrophobic drug encapsulation, the precise control of drug loading and encapsulation efficiency remains a significant challenge. This work reports a new concentration\u2010controlled nanoprecipitation platform technology for fabricating lipid nanoparticles with tunable drug loading up to 70 wt%. This method is applicable for encapsulating a wide range of drugs from very hydrophobic to slightly hydrophilic. Using this facile method, nanoparticles with tunable drug loading exhibited excellent properties such as small particle size, narrow size distribution, good particle stability, showing great promise for future drug delivery applications.",

                    "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have emerged as promising therapeutic delivery vehicles for a wide range of drugs over the past few decades. The amphipathic and biodegradable nature of the lipid nanomaterials makes them attractive for encapsulating both hydrophobic and hydrophilic therapeutic drugs for drug delivery. [1] The great success of COVID-19 mRNAlipid vaccines have rightly put lipids on the spotlight again. [2] NPs can be categorized into two main groups: liposomes with a water core and lipid bilayer structure, and solid LNPs. However, most LNPs in the clinical context have limited drug loading (< 10 wt%). [3] While the emulsion/solvent evaporation method can produce NPs with drug loading up to 14%, other common approaches such as traditional nanoprecipitation method or evaporation method can only achieve a drug loading less than 5%. [4,5] Such a low drug loading requires the excessive use of nanocarriers to achieve the therapeutic threshold of drugs, leading to toxic side effects and degradation burden. [6] In contrast, high drug loading NPs offer advantages such as improving intravenous injection compatibility, minimizing material toxicity, reducing manufacturing cost and increasing production scalability. [3,6] Meanwhile, it has been demonstrated that cells are only able to uptake a limited number of NPs. According to a previous research, SKOV3 cells have been shown to have a limited capacity for NPs cellular uptake, with a maximum of 1.9 \u00d7 10 5 particles taken up by a single SKOV3 cell. [7] Therefore, a minimum number of NPs with sufficient amount of drug loaded is beneficial for delivering a maximum amount of drug. [7] It is therefore of great significance to develop LNPs with tunable drug loading, ranging from low to very high, thereby reducing the need for excessive use of nanocarriers and improving drug delivery efficacy. \n\n14] Among the approaches, nanoprecipitation is the simplest method for lipid-based nanoparticle production, and does not require high-shear force/high-temperature/high-pressure.

Compared to liposomes which have a lipid bilayer surrounding an aqueous core, lipid nanoparticles with a particle structure have several attractive advantages for encapsulating poorly water\u2010soluble drugs such as better stability due to the particle structure, high drug encapsulation efficiency because of a pre\u2010 or co\u2010drug\u2010loading strategy. While many studies have reported the synthesis of lipid nanoparticles for hydrophobic drug encapsulation, the precise control of drug loading and encapsulation efficiency remains a significant challenge. This work reports a new concentration\u2010controlled nanoprecipitation platform technology for fabricating lipid nanoparticles with tunable drug loading up to 70 wt%. This method is applicable for encapsulating a wide range of drugs from very hydrophobic to slightly hydrophilic. Using this facile method, nanoparticles with tunable drug loading exhibited excellent properties such as small particle size, narrow size distribution, good particle stability, showing great promise for future drug delivery applications.\n## INTRODUCTION\nLipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have emerged as promising therapeutic delivery vehicles for a wide range of drugs over the past few decades. The amphipathic and biodegradable nature of the lipid nanomaterials makes them attractive for encapsulating both hydrophobic and hydrophilic therapeutic drugs for drug delivery. [1] The great success of COVID-19 mRNAlipid vaccines have rightly put lipids on the spotlight again. [2] NPs can be categorized into two main groups: liposomes with a water core and lipid bilayer structure, and solid LNPs. However, most LNPs in the clinical context have limited drug loading (< 10 wt%). [3] While the emulsion/solvent evaporation method can produce NPs with drug loading up to 14%, other common approaches such as traditional nanoprecipitation method or evaporation method can only achieve a drug loading less than 5%. [4,5] Such a low drug loading requires the excessive use of nanocarriers to achieve the therapeutic threshold of drugs, leading to toxic side effects and degradation burden. [6] In contrast, high drug loading NPs offer advantages such as improving intravenous injection compatibility, minimizing material toxicity, reducing manufacturing cost and increasing production scalability. [3,6] Meanwhile, it has been demonstrated that cells are only able to uptake a limited number of NPs. According to a previous research, SKOV3 cells have been shown to have a limited capacity for NPs cellular uptake, with a maximum of 1.9 \u00d7 10 5 particles taken up by a single SKOV3 cell. [7] Therefore, a minimum number of NPs with sufficient amount of drug loaded is beneficial for delivering a maximum amount of drug. [7] It is therefore of great significance to develop LNPs with tunable drug loading, ranging from low to very high, thereby reducing the need for excessive use of nanocarriers and improving drug delivery efficacy. \n\n14] Among the approaches, nanoprecipitation is the simplest method for lipid-based nanoparticle production, and does not require high-shear force/high-temperature/high-pressure.

A drug with poor aqueous solubility, therefore, poses challenges with regards to its pharmaceutical advance and ultimately its biological usage. Lipid nanoparticles have been used in pharmaceutical science due to their importance in green chemistry.

The physicochemical attributes, such as size, nucleic acid encapsulation and electric charge, may have a significant impact on the efficacy of these medicines. In this study, adjustments to aqueous to lipid phase ratios were assessed for their impact on LNP size and other critical quality attributes (CQAs). It was observed that minor adjustments of aqueous-to-organic lipid phase ratios can be used to precisely control the size of ALC-0315-formulated LNPs. This was then used to evaluate the impact of phase ratio and corresponding size ranges on the in vitro and in vivo expression of these LNPs. In HEK293 cells, larger LNPs led to higher expression of the mRNA cargo within the LNPs, with a linear correlation between size and expression. In THP-1 cells this preference for larger LNPs was observed up to 120 d.nm after which there was a fall in expression. In BALB/c mice, however, LNPs at the lowest phase ratio tested, >120 d.nm, showed reduced expression compared to those of range 60\u2013120 d.nm, within which there was no significant difference between sizes. These results suggest a robustness of LNP expression up to 120 d.nm, larger than those <100 d.nm conventionally used in medicine.",

What differentiates LNPs from other lipid-based nanoparticle formats is the presence of a solid core created from nucleic acid complexed to a permanent or ionisable cationic lipid. 2][3] The COVID-19 pandemic placed LNPs in the spotlight, hugely increasing interest and recognition of their potential in drug and vaccine delivery, which is evidenced by a doubling of published literature on LNPs in the last 5 years. 4 ptimising LNP manufacture has emerged as valuable research, especially concerning production speeds, scalability, stability and efficacy of the end product. 5,6 The growth of this field is driven by challenges faced during the rapid mass production of LNP-based mRNA vaccines during the pandemic. One of the biggest challenges was producing formulations rapidly to meet demand. Furthermore, manufacturing formu-lation parameters have been widely explored in the field of liposomes, 7,8 so translating this research to LNPs is valuable. In addition to optimisation of the manufacturing process, testing the robustness of parameters used is vital, as this aids in understanding the formulation, as well as defining the limits within formulations, and expands the knowledge base in nanomedicine formulation strategy. For example, there is evidence that size impacts LNP immunogenicity and mRNA expression, impacting therapeutic efficacy. 3,9,10 However, the impact varies based on the indication and pharmacokinetics; while larger LNPs (>100 d.nm) may have higher mRNA expression, 10 there is evidence that smaller LNPs (<100 d nm) are more readily absorbed from the injection site. 9 icrofluidics is a precise, reproducible, and scalable method for manufacturing LNPs. It has easily adjustable parameters, which can be precisely controlled with relative ease in comparison with other methods of LNP manufacturing. 11 arameters, such as mixing speed and flow-rate ratio, can significantly impact the critical quality attributes of the produced LNPs.",

Rattray, Yvonne Perrie\n## Abstract\nLipid nanoparticles (LNPs), most commonly recognised for their role in COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, are important delivery vehicles for nucleic acid (mRNA, siRNA) therapies. The physicochemical attributes, such as size, nucleic acid encapsulation and electric charge, may have a significant impact on the efficacy of these medicines. In this study, adjustments to aqueous to lipid phase ratios were assessed for their impact on LNP size and other critical quality attributes (CQAs). It was observed that minor adjustments of aqueous-to-organic lipid phase ratios can be used to precisely control the size of ALC-0315-formulated LNPs. This was then used to evaluate the impact of phase ratio and corresponding size ranges on the in vitro and in vivo expression of these LNPs. In HEK293 cells, larger LNPs led to higher expression of the mRNA cargo within the LNPs, with a linear correlation between size and expression. In THP-1 cells this preference for larger LNPs was observed up to 120 d.nm after which there was a fall in expression. In BALB/c mice, however, LNPs at the lowest phase ratio tested, >120 d.nm, showed reduced expression compared to those of range 60\u2013120 d.nm, within which there was no significant difference between sizes. These results suggest a robustness of LNP expression up to 120 d.nm, larger than those <100 d.nm conventionally used in medicine.\n## Introduction\nLipid nanoparticles (LNPs) lie within the family of lipid-based nanoparticles, which also includes liposomes, and other nanoscale lipid complexes. What differentiates LNPs from other lipid-based nanoparticle formats is the presence of a solid core created from nucleic acid complexed to a permanent or ionisable cationic lipid. 2][3] The COVID-19 pandemic placed LNPs in the spotlight, hugely increasing interest and recognition of their potential in drug and vaccine delivery, which is evidenced by a doubling of published literature on LNPs in the last 5 years. 4 ptimising LNP manufacture has emerged as valuable research, especially concerning production speeds, scalability, stability and efficacy of the end product. 5,6 The growth of this field is driven by challenges faced during the rapid mass production of LNP-based mRNA vaccines during the pandemic. One of the biggest challenges was producing formulations rapidly to meet demand. Furthermore, manufacturing formu-lation parameters have been widely explored in the field of liposomes, 7,8 so translating this research to LNPs is valuable. In addition to optimisation of the manufacturing process, testing the robustness of parameters used is vital, as this aids in understanding the formulation, as well as defining the limits within formulations, and expands the knowledge base in nanomedicine formulation strategy. For example, there is evidence that size impacts LNP immunogenicity and mRNA expression, impacting therapeutic efficacy. 3,9,10 However, the impact varies based on the indication and pharmacokinetics; while larger LNPs (>100 d.nm) may have higher mRNA expression, 10 there is evidence that smaller LNPs (<100 d nm) are more readily absorbed from the injection site. 9 icrofluidics is a precise, reproducible, and scalable method for manufacturing LNPs. It has easily adjustable parameters, which can be precisely controlled with relative ease in comparison with other methods of LNP manufacturing. 11 arameters, such as mixing speed and flow-rate ratio, can significantly impact the critical quality attributes of the produced LNPs.",

In this review, we aim to highlight the progress in the development of these lipid nanoparticles for various applications, ranging from cancer nanomedicines to COVID-19 vaccines. The lipid-based nanoparticles discussed in this review are liposomes, niosomes, transfersomes, solid lipid nanoparticles, and nanostructured lipid carriers. We particularly focus on the innovations that have obtained regulatory approval or that are in clinical trials. We also discuss the physicochemical properties required for specific applications, highlight the differences in requirements for the delivery of different cargos, and introduce current challenges that need further development. This review serves as a useful guideline for designing new lipid nanoparticles for both preventative and therapeutic vaccines including immunotherapies.",

Following on SLNs, nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) have been developed to enhance drug encapsulation and prevent drug leakage. NLCs are composed of an unstructured lipid interior and a monolayer surfactant periphery (Figure 2). The core is made of a mixture of solid and liquid lipids that form an imperfect crystal interior to increase the drug loading, while SLNs are saturating the drug loading due to a solid crystal lattice. In addition, this liquid phase in NLC inhibits drug release during storage [36]. \n\nMoreover, lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles have been studied to create synergies between lipid-based nanoparticles and polymeric particles. Indeed, Zhang et al. made a comparison between lipid-based nanoparticles, polymeric nanoparticles and the hybrid nanoparticles loaded with cisplatin, where the in vivo data suggests that cisplatin-loaded lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles inhibited the ovarian carcinoma most effectively [37]. Additionally, these hybrid particles have also been considered in gene delivery applications [24,38]. By optimizing the properties of lipid-based nanoparticles, the safety, encapsulating capacity, stability, pharmacokinetics, bio-distribution, and therapeutic benefit can be controlled as a result [39].",

H. Thi, Estelle J A Suys, J. S. Lee, D. Nguyen, K. Park, N. Truong\n## Abstract\nCOVID-19 vaccines have been developed with unprecedented speed which would not have been possible without decades of fundamental research on delivery nanotechnology. Lipid-based nanoparticles have played a pivotal role in the successes of COVID-19 vaccines and many other nanomedicines, such as Doxil\u00ae and Onpattro\u00ae, and have therefore been considered as the frontrunner in nanoscale drug delivery systems. In this review, we aim to highlight the progress in the development of these lipid nanoparticles for various applications, ranging from cancer nanomedicines to COVID-19 vaccines. The lipid-based nanoparticles discussed in this review are liposomes, niosomes, transfersomes, solid lipid nanoparticles, and nanostructured lipid carriers. We particularly focus on the innovations that have obtained regulatory approval or that are in clinical trials. We also discuss the physicochemical properties required for specific applications, highlight the differences in requirements for the delivery of different cargos, and introduce current challenges that need further development. This review serves as a useful guideline for designing new lipid nanoparticles for both preventative and therapeutic vaccines including immunotherapies.\n## Overview of Lipid-Based Nanoparticles\nAll these lipophilic bi/multilayer nanoparticles with hydrophilic core are able to encapsulate both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs without chemical intervention. Hydrophobic drugs are preferentially sandwiched in the external bilayer, while hydrophilic molecules are incorporated in the aqueous cavity (Figure 2). These particles are therefore considered an effective carrier for a wide spectrum of drugs, with sufficient protection, sustainable drug release, and improved bioavailability. [27,33] Biocompatible and biodegradable ingredients, high cell uptake, good protection of drugs in acidic pH, long shelf life, ease of drug entrapment [32] Gelling tendency [29] Nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) \n\nSolid and liquid lipids (fats and oils), surfactants [32] All SLN's advantages but higher drug encapsulation, more sustainable drug release, better diuretic activity and fewer drug lost within storage time [32] Optimization required of the ratio of solid/liquid lipids The drawbacks related to their limited stability, toxicity, low loading capacity, and convoluted manufacturing has sparked the interest of researchers to develop a new class of particles became [25,29], mainly aiming at improving the encapsulation efficiency [12]. Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs, Figure 2) are made of solid fats and surfactants to form a spherical nanoparticle with a solid lipid core and a monolayer shell [33,34]. They exhibit greater encapsulation efficiency for hydrophobic drugs than liposomes since they lack an aqueous core. This rigid core also improved the stability of SLNs compared to liposomes and polymeric nanoparticles. Indeed, SLNs in aqueous media could be stored for at least 3 years [35].

Additionally, the large-scale production and excellent reproducibility of SLNs are important properties for downstream commercial and clinical applications [29].\n...\nAdditionally, the large-scale production and excellent reproducibility of SLNs are important properties for downstream commercial and clinical applications [29]. Following on SLNs, nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) have been developed to enhance drug encapsulation and prevent drug leakage. NLCs are composed of an unstructured lipid interior and a monolayer surfactant periphery (Figure 2). The core is made of a mixture of solid and liquid lipids that form an imperfect crystal interior to increase the drug loading, while SLNs are saturating the drug loading due to a solid crystal lattice. In addition, this liquid phase in NLC inhibits drug release during storage [36]. \n\nMoreover, lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles have been studied to create synergies between lipid-based nanoparticles and polymeric particles. Indeed, Zhang et al. made a comparison between lipid-based nanoparticles, polymeric nanoparticles and the hybrid nanoparticles loaded with cisplatin, where the in vivo data suggests that cisplatin-loaded lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles inhibited the ovarian carcinoma most effectively [37]. Additionally, these hybrid particles have also been considered in gene delivery applications [24,38]. By optimizing the properties of lipid-based nanoparticles, the safety, encapsulating capacity, stability, pharmacokinetics, bio-distribution, and therapeutic benefit can be controlled as a result [39].",

Consequently, new antimicrobial strategies are urgently required. Drug delivery systems represent a potential solution to improve current antibiotic properties and reverse resistance mechanisms. Among different drug delivery systems, solid lipid nanoparticles represent a highly interesting option as they offer many advantages for nontoxic targeted drug delivery. Several publications have demonstrated the capacity of SLNs to significantly improve antibiotic characteristics increasing treatment efficiency. In this review article, antibiotic-loaded solid lipid nanoparticle-related works are analyzed to summarize all information associated with applying these new formulations to tackle the antibiotic resistance problem. The main antimicrobial resistance mechanisms and relevant solid lipid nanoparticle characteristics are presented to later discuss the potential of these nanoparticles to improve current antibiotic treatment characteristics and overcome antimicrobial resistance mechanisms. Moreover, solid lipid nanoparticles also offer new possibilities for other antimicrobial agents that cannot be administrated as free drugs. The advantages and disadvantages of these new formulations are also discussed in this review. Finally, given the progress of the studies carried out to date, future directions are discussed.",

Different nanoparticles can be obtained composed of biocompatible and biodegradable lipids: liposomes, nanostructured lipid carriers or solid lipid nanoparticles, for instance. Liposomes have been the most applied lipid-based drug delivery systems, and they have also been approved for clinical treatments [32]. Nonetheless, they present a low capacity to encapsulate hydrophobic molecules, low storage stability and eventual drug leakage in the media [31,32]. \n\nSolid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) offer an interesting alternative to liposomes as promising robust nanocarriers for controlled drug delivery. They present a hydrophobic internal core composed of solid lipids at room or body temperature and an external stabilizing layer formed by amphiphilic surfactants and sometimes co-surfactants (Figure 2). They present many advantages, such as low toxicity, high stability, high biocompatibility and biodegradability, and the remarkable capacity to incorporate both hydrophilic and lipophilic compounds. In addition, they enable a controlled release of the incorporated drug, and they provide chemical protection to the compound. They can be produced by simple and economical large-scale production, and it has been demonstrated that they can be effectively administrated through a wide variety of routes (oral, parenteral, rectal, nasal, ocular, etc.) [31]. The components, production methods and characterization protocols for the SLNs development are beyond the scope of this review and are already reviewed elsewhere [31,[33][34][35]. \n\nAnother advantage of SLNs is that their surface can be easily modified to modulate some relevant biological interactions. For instance, signaling molecules can be added to obtain targeted drug delivery, or surface characteristics can be altered by adding polymers (such as polyethylene glycol, PEG) to obtain a steal drug delivery system inside the organism [31,36].",

Alkorta\n## Abstract\nAntimicrobial resistance is one of the biggest threats to global health as current antibiotics are becoming useless against resistant infectious pathogens. Consequently, new antimicrobial strategies are urgently required. Drug delivery systems represent a potential solution to improve current antibiotic properties and reverse resistance mechanisms. Among different drug delivery systems, solid lipid nanoparticles represent a highly interesting option as they offer many advantages for nontoxic targeted drug delivery. Several publications have demonstrated the capacity of SLNs to significantly improve antibiotic characteristics increasing treatment efficiency. In this review article, antibiotic-loaded solid lipid nanoparticle-related works are analyzed to summarize all information associated with applying these new formulations to tackle the antibiotic resistance problem. The main antimicrobial resistance mechanisms and relevant solid lipid nanoparticle characteristics are presented to later discuss the potential of these nanoparticles to improve current antibiotic treatment characteristics and overcome antimicrobial resistance mechanisms. Moreover, solid lipid nanoparticles also offer new possibilities for other antimicrobial agents that cannot be administrated as free drugs. The advantages and disadvantages of these new formulations are also discussed in this review. Finally, given the progress of the studies carried out to date, future directions are discussed.\n## New Strategies to Overcome Antimicrobial Resistance Mechanisms\nTherefore, lipid-based nanoparticles are less toxic and more biocompatible than inorganic or polymeric nanoparticles [31]. Different nanoparticles can be obtained composed of biocompatible and biodegradable lipids: liposomes, nanostructured lipid carriers or solid lipid nanoparticles, for instance. Liposomes have been the most applied lipid-based drug delivery systems, and they have also been approved for clinical treatments [32]. Nonetheless, they present a low capacity to encapsulate hydrophobic molecules, low storage stability and eventual drug leakage in the media [31,32]. \n\nSolid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) offer an interesting alternative to liposomes as promising robust nanocarriers for controlled drug delivery. They present a hydrophobic internal core composed of solid lipids at room or body temperature and an external stabilizing layer formed by amphiphilic surfactants and sometimes co-surfactants (Figure 2). They present many advantages, such as low toxicity, high stability, high biocompatibility and biodegradability, and the remarkable capacity to incorporate both hydrophilic and lipophilic compounds. In addition, they enable a controlled release of the incorporated drug, and they provide chemical protection to the compound. They can be produced by simple and economical large-scale production, and it has been demonstrated that they can be effectively administrated through a wide variety of routes (oral, parenteral, rectal, nasal, ocular, etc.) [31]. The components, production methods and characterization protocols for the SLNs development are beyond the scope of this review and are already reviewed elsewhere [31,[33][34][35]. \n\nAnother advantage of SLNs is that their surface can be easily modified to modulate some relevant biological interactions. For instance, signaling molecules can be added to obtain targeted drug delivery, or surface characteristics can be altered by adding polymers (such as polyethylene glycol, PEG) to obtain a steal drug delivery system inside the organism [31,36].",

LNP consisting of 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC), cholesterol, N-(carbonyl-methoxypolyethyleneglycol-2000)-1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (MPEG-2000-DSPE), and various cationic surfactants were prepared at diverging flow rate ratios (FRR) via microfluidic mixing. Utilizing a second chip in the microfluidic set-up, LNP were coated with polyoxyethylene (9) nonylphenol monophosphate ester (PNPP). LNP were examined for their stability in different physiologically relevant media as well as for hemolytic and cytotoxic effects. Finally, phosphate release and charge conversion of PNPP-coated LNP were evaluated after incubation with alkaline phosphatase and on Caco2-cells. LNP produced at an FRR of 5:1 exhibited a size between 80 and 150 nm and a positive zeta potential. Coating with PNPP within the second chip led to LNP exhibiting a negative zeta potential. After incubation with 1 U/ml alkaline phosphatase for 4 h, zeta potential of the LNP containing 1,2-dioleoyloxy-3-trimethylammonium-propane chloride (DOTAP) as cationic component shifted from\u2009\u2212\u200935 mV to approximately\u2009+\u20095 mV.

Bernkop\u2010Schn\u00fcrch\n## Abstract\nIt was the aim of this study to design charge converting lipid nanoparticles (LNP) via a microfluidic mixing technique used for the preparation and coating of LNP. LNP consisting of 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC), cholesterol, N-(carbonyl-methoxypolyethyleneglycol-2000)-1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (MPEG-2000-DSPE), and various cationic surfactants were prepared at diverging flow rate ratios (FRR) via microfluidic mixing. Utilizing a second chip in the microfluidic set-up, LNP were coated with polyoxyethylene (9) nonylphenol monophosphate ester (PNPP). LNP were examined for their stability in different physiologically relevant media as well as for hemolytic and cytotoxic effects. Finally, phosphate release and charge conversion of PNPP-coated LNP were evaluated after incubation with alkaline phosphatase and on Caco2-cells. LNP produced at an FRR of 5:1 exhibited a size between 80 and 150 nm and a positive zeta potential. Coating with PNPP within the second chip led to LNP exhibiting a negative zeta potential. After incubation with 1 U/ml alkaline phosphatase for 4 h, zeta potential of the LNP containing 1,2-dioleoyloxy-3-trimethylammonium-propane chloride (DOTAP) as cationic component shifted from\u2009\u2212\u200935 mV to approximately\u2009+\u20095 mV. LNP prepared with other cationic surfactants remained slightly negative after enzymatic phosphate cleavage. Manufacturing of LNP containing PNPP and DOTAP via connection of two chips in a microfluidic instrument proves to show efficient change in zeta potential from negative to positive after incubation with alkaline phosphatase.

Gill, Luigi X Cubeddu\n## Abstract\nThis manuscript explores the use of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) in addressing the pivotal challenges of lung cancer treatment, including drug delivery inefficacy and multi-drug resistance. LNPs have significantly advanced targeted therapy by improving the precision and reducing the systemic toxicity of chemotherapeutics such as doxorubicin and paclitaxel. This manuscript details the design and benefits of various LNP systems, including solid lipid\u2013polymer hybrids, which offer controlled release and enhanced drug encapsulation. Despite achievements in reducing tumor size and enhancing survival, challenges such as manufacturing complexity, biocompatibility, and variable clinical outcomes persist. Future directions are aimed at refining targeting capabilities, expanding combinatorial therapies, and integrating advanced manufacturing techniques to tailor treatments to individual patient profiles, thus promising to transform lung cancer therapy through interdisciplinary collaboration and regulatory innovation.\n## Lipid-Based Nanoparticles\nLipid nanoparticles, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), and lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles (LPHNPs) represent innovative platforms in the field of drug delivery, offering unique advantages and applications in biomedicine.Lipid nanoparticles are highly regarded for their ability to control the release of therapeutic molecules, particularly those that are hydrophobic and have low bioavailability.SLNs and nanostructured lipid carriers are praised for their low toxicity, enhanced encapsulation capacity, controlled drug release kinetics, and scalability, making them pivotal in drug delivery systems [10].\n\nSolid lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles (SLPNs) have emerged as a novel category, combining the beneficial properties of lipids with the stability and functional versatility of polymers.This fusion results in nanocarriers with a controlled particle size, high drug loading yield, and sustained drug release capabilities.Moreover, the hybrid structure of lipid-polymer nanoparticles improved in vitro and in vivo stability, signifying their potential as robust drug carriers [11].\n\nThe lipid-based nanocarriers are gaining significant interest by researchers working on the development of novel formulations for the pulmonary delivery of anticancer drugs owing to their biocompatible, biodegradable, non-toxic, and non-irritant nature, the ability to entrap and deliver diverse molecules in a controlled manner with enhanced bioavailability, the ability to transport across blood vessels and different membranes and barriers, in addition to the ease of preparation and scale-up.Each type of lipid-based carrier has a unique structure, as shown in Figure 1 [12].\n\nPharmaceutics 2024, 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 31\n\nIn summary, the continuous evolution of drug delivery technologies, particularly through LNPs, is essential in addressing the numerous challenges in lung cancer treatment.These technologies promise to enhance the precision, efficacy, and safety of cancer therapeutics, directly responding to the unmet needs and gaps in current treatment modalities.\n...\nLipid nanoparticles, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), and lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles (LPHNPs) represent innovative platforms in the field of drug delivery, offering unique advantages and applications in biomedicine.Lipid nanoparticles are highly regarded for their ability to control the release of therapeutic molecules, particularly those that are hydrophobic and have low bioavailability.SLNs and nanostructured lipid carriers are praised for their low toxicity, enhanced encapsulation capacity, controlled drug release kinetics, and scalability, making them pivotal in drug delivery systems [10].\n\nSolid lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles (SLPNs) have emerged as a novel category, combining the beneficial properties of lipids with the stability and functional versatility of polymers.This fusion results in nanocarriers with a controlled particle size, high drug loading yield, and sustained drug release capabilities.Moreover, the hybrid structure of lipid-polymer nanoparticles improved in vitro and in vivo stability, signifying their potential as robust drug carriers [11].\n\nThe lipid-based nanocarriers are gaining significant interest by researchers working on the development of novel formulations for the pulmonary delivery of anticancer drugs owing to their biocompatible, biodegradable, non-toxic, and non-irritant nature, the ability to entrap and deliver diverse molecules in a controlled manner with enhanced bioavailability, the ability to transport across blood vessels and different membranes and barriers, in addition to the ease of preparation and scale-up.Each type of lipid-based carrier has a unique structure, as shown in Figure 1 [12].Together, lipid-based nanoparticles, especially the advanced solid lipid-polymer hybrid types, hold significant promise for transforming drug delivery, offering targeted, controlled, and efficient therapeutic molecule transport.The continuous research and Pharmaceutics 2024, 16, 644 3 of 30 development in this area are likely to further refine these systems, overcoming current limitations and paving the way for their widespread application in treating complex diseases like cancer [13].\n\nOn the other hand, there are challenges and drawbacks associated with these nanocarriers.",

The lack of long-lasting effects of non-viral vectors is an advantage for infectious disease vaccines. With the introduction of microfluidic processes that facilitate the encapsulation of nucleic acid cargo, lipid nanoparticles are being studied as delivery vehicles for various RNA-based biopharmaceuticals. In particular, using microfluidic chip-based fabrication processes, nucleic acids such as RNA and proteins can be effectively incorporated into lipid nanoparticles and utilized as delivery vehicles for various biopharmaceuticals. Due to the successful development of mRNA therapies, lipid nanoparticles have emerged as a promising approach for the delivery of biopharmaceuticals. Biopharmaceuticals of various types (DNA, mRNA, short RNA, proteins) possess expression mechanisms that are suitable for manufacturing personalized cancer vaccines, while also requiring formulation with lipid nanoparticles. In this review, we describe the basic design of lipid nanoparticles, the types of biopharmaceuticals used as carriers, and the microfluidic processes involved. We then present research cases focusing on lipid-nanoparticle-based immune modulation and discuss the current status of commercially available lipid nanoparticles, as well as future prospects for the development of lipid nanoparticles for immune regulation purposes.",

                    "text": "To compensate for this, ionizable lipids that are neutral in circulation and positively charged only in endosomes have been developed and actively studied [19]. \n\nThe use of microfluidic mixing enables the fabrication of LNPs that effectively shield biopharmaceuticals [20]. Conventional batch-mode mixing methods rely on the homogenization of the particle size through sonication and extrusion [21]. However, mass production using these methods is difficult, and high batch-to-batch variability is a drawback. In particular, low yields and complex processes have made the clinical transition of LNPs difficult. In contrast, microfluidic production techniques have the advantage of producing homogeneously sized nanoparticles via a simple process, and large quantities of these nanoparticles can be easily produced [20]. The size of the nanoparticles can also be effectively controlled using microfluidic devices [22]. siRNA-loaded LNPs smaller than 50 nm that are capable of tumor penetration have been prepared using this technique [20]. \n\nThe first approved siRNA-loaded LNPs (Onpattro) demonstrated the potential of LNP production using a microfluidic-based ethanol injection method for medicinal applications [22]. The mRNA vaccines recently launched by Moderna and Pfizer are lipid nanoparticle formulations produced using microfluidic processes. In vaccine development, Lipid-based nanoparticles offer a diverse range of options for drug delivery. Each type exhibits unique properties that can be tailored to meet the specific requirements of the therapeutic cargo. Factors such as the nature of the cargo, desired release kinetics, and the targeted delivery site play crucial roles in selecting the appropriate lipid-based nanoparticles. Ongoing research and development in this field hold immense promise for advancing drug delivery strategies and improving therapeutic outcomes. \n\nRecently, LNPs have been actively investigated for the delivery of RNA-based biopharmaceuticals [11,12]. Although non-viral vectors such as LNP have lower efficiency than viral vectors, the former are biosafe and have the advantage of being able to carry large mRNA sequences [13,14].",

                    "text": "Although non-viral vectors such as LNP have lower efficiency than viral vectors, the former are biosafe and have the advantage of being able to carry large mRNA sequences [13,14]. Furthermore, LNPs can easily fulfill three requirements for nucleic acid delivery vehicles: efficient encapsulation to resist degradation by nucleases, a mechanism for targeted delivery and intracellular entry, and a manufacturing process that allows for the mass production of uniformly sized nanoparticles [15]. The cargo content and physicochemical properties (particle size, shape, surface charge, etc.) of LNPs can be controlled by adjusting the lipid composition [16]. \n\nNanoparticles containing cationic lipids have been widely studied as carriers of genes and nucleic acids because of their ability to carry negatively charged nucleic acids and attach to the lipid bilayer of cells [17]. However, cytotoxicity due to cationic lipids and rapid elimination from the body are limitations [18]. To compensate for this, ionizable lipids that are neutral in circulation and positively charged only in endosomes have been developed and actively studied [19]. \n\nThe use of microfluidic mixing enables the fabrication of LNPs that effectively shield biopharmaceuticals [20]. Conventional batch-mode mixing methods rely on the homogenization of the particle size through sonication and extrusion [21]. However, mass production using these methods is difficult, and high batch-to-batch variability is a drawback. In particular, low yields and complex processes have made the clinical transition of LNPs difficult. In contrast, microfluidic production techniques have the advantage of producing homogeneously sized nanoparticles via a simple process, and large quantities of these nanoparticles can be easily produced [20]. The size of the nanoparticles can also be effectively controlled using microfluidic devices [22]. siRNA-loaded LNPs smaller than 50 nm that are capable of tumor penetration have been prepared using this technique [20]. \n\nThe first approved siRNA-loaded LNPs (Onpattro) demonstrated the potential of LNP production using a microfluidic-based ethanol injection method for medicinal applications [22].",

Shim\n## Abstract\nIn recent years, with the approval of preventative vaccines for pandemics, lipid nanoparticles have become a prominent RNA delivery vehicle. The lack of long-lasting effects of non-viral vectors is an advantage for infectious disease vaccines. With the introduction of microfluidic processes that facilitate the encapsulation of nucleic acid cargo, lipid nanoparticles are being studied as delivery vehicles for various RNA-based biopharmaceuticals. In particular, using microfluidic chip-based fabrication processes, nucleic acids such as RNA and proteins can be effectively incorporated into lipid nanoparticles and utilized as delivery vehicles for various biopharmaceuticals. Due to the successful development of mRNA therapies, lipid nanoparticles have emerged as a promising approach for the delivery of biopharmaceuticals. Biopharmaceuticals of various types (DNA, mRNA, short RNA, proteins) possess expression mechanisms that are suitable for manufacturing personalized cancer vaccines, while also requiring formulation with lipid nanoparticles. In this review, we describe the basic design of lipid nanoparticles, the types of biopharmaceuticals used as carriers, and the microfluidic processes involved. We then present research cases focusing on lipid-nanoparticle-based immune modulation and discuss the current status of commercially available lipid nanoparticles, as well as future prospects for the development of lipid nanoparticles for immune regulation purposes.\n## Introduction\nTo compensate for this, ionizable lipids that are neutral in circulation and positively charged only in endosomes have been developed and actively studied [19]. \n\nThe use of microfluidic mixing enables the fabrication of LNPs that effectively shield biopharmaceuticals [20]. Conventional batch-mode mixing methods rely on the homogenization of the particle size through sonication and extrusion [21]. However, mass production using these methods is difficult, and high batch-to-batch variability is a drawback. In particular, low yields and complex processes have made the clinical transition of LNPs difficult. In contrast, microfluidic production techniques have the advantage of producing homogeneously sized nanoparticles via a simple process, and large quantities of these nanoparticles can be easily produced [20]. The size of the nanoparticles can also be effectively controlled using microfluidic devices [22]. siRNA-loaded LNPs smaller than 50 nm that are capable of tumor penetration have been prepared using this technique [20]. \n\nThe first approved siRNA-loaded LNPs (Onpattro) demonstrated the potential of LNP production using a microfluidic-based ethanol injection method for medicinal applications [22]. The mRNA vaccines recently launched by Moderna and Pfizer are lipid nanoparticle formulations produced using microfluidic processes. In vaccine development, Lipid-based nanoparticles offer a diverse range of options for drug delivery. Each type exhibits unique properties that can be tailored to meet the specific requirements of the therapeutic cargo. Factors such as the nature of the cargo, desired release kinetics, and the targeted delivery site play crucial roles in selecting the appropriate lipid-based nanoparticles. Ongoing research and development in this field hold immense promise for advancing drug delivery strategies and improving therapeutic outcomes. \n\nRecently, LNPs have been actively investigated for the delivery of RNA-based biopharmaceuticals [11,12]. Although non-viral vectors such as LNP have lower efficiency than viral vectors, the former are biosafe and have the advantage of being able to carry large mRNA sequences [13,14].\n...\nAlthough non-viral vectors such as LNP have lower efficiency than viral vectors, the former are biosafe and have the advantage of being able to carry large mRNA sequences [13,14]. Furthermore, LNPs can easily fulfill three requirements for nucleic acid delivery vehicles: efficient encapsulation to resist degradation by nucleases, a mechanism for targeted delivery and intracellular entry, and a manufacturing process that allows for the mass production of uniformly sized nanoparticles [15]. The cargo content and physicochemical properties (particle size, shape, surface charge, etc.) of LNPs can be controlled by adjusting the lipid composition [16]. \n\nNanoparticles containing cationic lipids have been widely studied as carriers of genes and nucleic acids because of their ability to carry negatively charged nucleic acids and attach to the lipid bilayer of cells [17]. However, cytotoxicity due to cationic lipids and rapid elimination from the body are limitations [18]. To compensate for this, ionizable lipids that are neutral in circulation and positively charged only in endosomes have been developed and actively studied [19]. \n\nThe use of microfluidic mixing enables the fabrication of LNPs that effectively shield biopharmaceuticals [20].

Since the materials used for LNPs production include natural sources, they offer several benefits over other materials. These advantages include temporal and thermal stability, ease of preparation, high loading capacity, relatively low production costs, and feasibility for large-scale industrial manufacturing [26]. The main natural sources used for LNPs production include (i) phospholipids and cholesterol, which enhance the stability and circulation capability of NPs within the biological matrix, and (ii) positively charged lipids, which improve the loading capacity of negatively charged molecules. Additionally, LNPs chemical modifications, such as conjugation with gangliosides or polyethylene glycol (PEG), increase solubility and prevent detection by the immune system [27]. LNPs efficiently penetrate cell membranes and deliver their cargo to intracellular target sites due to their similarity to the lipid components of the biological membranes [28]. Once internalized, LNPs release the encapsulated bioactive molecules by exploiting the low pH of the intracellular environment. LNPs can also be linked to antibodies to recognize malignant cells or receptors [26] (Figure 1). \n\nThe LNPs most commonly used in the biomedical field can be categorized into three main groups: liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN), and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) [29]. Liposomes are composed of amphipathic phospholipids organized in bilayer structures.

The permeability of hydrophobic drugs across the liposomal membrane can also be improved by adding cholesterol to the formulation.

The COVID-19 pandemic has changed our lives and although SARS-CoV-2 has caused irreversible health, social and economic damage, continuous and extensive efforts world-wide were essential to reduce its deleterious effects. During the last decades, the use of nanotechnology in medicine has effectively been translated to the design of drug delivery systems, nanostructured tissues, diagnostic platforms, and novel nanomaterials against several human diseases and infectious pathogens. Nanotechnology-enabled vaccines have been positioned as solutions to mitigate the pandemic outbreak caused by the novel pathogen severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. To fast-track the development of vaccines, unprecedented industrial and academic collaborations emerged around the world, resulting in the clinical translation of effective vaccines in less than one year. In this article, we provide an overview of the path to translation from the bench to the clinic of nanotechnology-enabled messenger ribonucleic acid vaccines and examine in detail the types of delivery systems used, their mechanisms of action, obtained results during each phase of their clinical development and their regulatory approval process. We also analyze how nanotechnology is impacting global health and economy during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.",

Lipid-based nanoparticles are excellent platforms for the encapsulation of diverse hydrophobic or hydrophilic therapeutics, including small molecules, proteins, and nucleic acids. Their multiple advantages include formulation and synthesis simplicity, self-assembly, biocompatibility, and high bioavailability [45]. Common fabrication techniques for lipid-based nanocarriers are highpressure homogenization, high-speed stirring, ultrasonication, emulsion/solvent evaporation, double emulsion, phase inversion, and solvent injection [46]. \n\nLipid-based NPs are divided into several types of systems: liposomal NPs, composed of a lipid bilayer enclosing a hydrophilic core; lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), liposome-like structures with diverse morphologies that usually form an inverse micelle within the core to encapsulate hydrophilic agents; and solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNPs) composed of a lipid monolayer enclosing a solid lipid core [47]. Gene delivery systems often use LNPs to encapsulate nucleic acids in spherical vesicles composed of several materials: ionizable or cationic lipids, helper lipids, and polyethylene glycol (PEG) [48]. Ionizable lipids, which are neutral at physiological pH and positively charged at low pH, are embedded in the micellar structure of LNPs to complex with negatively charged genetic material, aid endosomal escape, and protect against nuclease-mediated degradation [49,50]. Helper lipids such as distearoylphosphatidylcholine and cholesterol, promote cell membrane binding and provide structural rigidity. Because LNPs can be rapidly taken up by the reticuloendothelial system, PEG is commonly used to decorate the NP surface to increase bioavailability in the human body [51].",

Lopez-Cantu, Xichi Wang, Hector Carrasco-Magallanes, Samson Afewerki, Xingcai Zhang, J. Bonventre, G. U. Ruiz\u2010Esparza\n## Abstract\nPfizer\u2013BioNTech\u2019s and Moderna\u2019s nanotechnology-enabled mRNA vaccines are the first of its kind to be approved for human use. The COVID-19 pandemic has changed our lives and although SARS-CoV-2 has caused irreversible health, social and economic damage, continuous and extensive efforts world-wide were essential to reduce its deleterious effects. During the last decades, the use of nanotechnology in medicine has effectively been translated to the design of drug delivery systems, nanostructured tissues, diagnostic platforms, and novel nanomaterials against several human diseases and infectious pathogens. Nanotechnology-enabled vaccines have been positioned as solutions to mitigate the pandemic outbreak caused by the novel pathogen severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. To fast-track the development of vaccines, unprecedented industrial and academic collaborations emerged around the world, resulting in the clinical translation of effective vaccines in less than one year. In this article, we provide an overview of the path to translation from the bench to the clinic of nanotechnology-enabled messenger ribonucleic acid vaccines and examine in detail the types of delivery systems used, their mechanisms of action, obtained results during each phase of their clinical development and their regulatory approval process. We also analyze how nanotechnology is impacting global health and economy during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.\n## Lipid-Based Nanoparticles\nLipid-based nanoparticles have been the most common class of nanomedicines approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [44]. Lipid-based nanoparticles are excellent platforms for the encapsulation of diverse hydrophobic or hydrophilic therapeutics, including small molecules, proteins, and nucleic acids. Their multiple advantages include formulation and synthesis simplicity, self-assembly, biocompatibility, and high bioavailability [45]. Common fabrication techniques for lipid-based nanocarriers are highpressure homogenization, high-speed stirring, ultrasonication, emulsion/solvent evaporation, double emulsion, phase inversion, and solvent injection [46]. \n\nLipid-based NPs are divided into several types of systems: liposomal NPs, composed of a lipid bilayer enclosing a hydrophilic core; lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), liposome-like structures with diverse morphologies that usually form an inverse micelle within the core to encapsulate hydrophilic agents; and solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNPs) composed of a lipid monolayer enclosing a solid lipid core [47]. Gene delivery systems often use LNPs to encapsulate nucleic acids in spherical vesicles composed of several materials: ionizable or cationic lipids, helper lipids, and polyethylene glycol (PEG) [48]. Ionizable lipids, which are neutral at physiological pH and positively charged at low pH, are embedded in the micellar structure of LNPs to complex with negatively charged genetic material, aid endosomal escape, and protect against nuclease-mediated degradation [49,50]. Helper lipids such as distearoylphosphatidylcholine and cholesterol, promote cell membrane binding and provide structural rigidity. Because LNPs can be rapidly taken up by the reticuloendothelial system, PEG is commonly used to decorate the NP surface to increase bioavailability in the human body [51].",

Therefore, it has very low oral bioavailability. In this study, glyceryl monostearate (GMS) and Capryol\u2122 90 were selected as solid and liquid lipids, respectively, to develop CC-NLC (nanostructured lipid carrier). CC was successfully encapsulated into NLP (CC-NLC) to enhance its oral bioavailability. CC-NLC was formulated using a hot homogenization-ultrasonication technique, and the physicochemical properties were characterized. The developed CC-NLC formulation was showed in nanometric size (121.6 \u00b1 6.2 nm) with high encapsulation efficiency (96.23 \u00b1 3.14%). Furthermore, it appeared almost spherical in morphology under a transmission electron microscope. The surgical experiment of the designed CC-NLC for absorption from the gastrointestinal tract revealed that CC-NLC absorption in the stomach was only 15.26% of that in the intestine. Otherwise, cellular uptake study exhibit that CC-NLCs should be internalized through the enterocytes after that transported through the systemic circulation. The pharmacokinetic results indicated that the oral bioavailability of CC was remarkably improved above 2-fold after encapsulation into nanostructured lipid carriers. These results ensured that nanostructured lipid carriers have a highly beneficial effect on improving the oral bioavailability of poorly water-soluble drugs, such as CC.",

NLCs were developed to solve the drawbacks of SLNs. Therefore, NLCs vary from SLNs by the feature of being smaller in size, better shelf-life stability, and better drug loading capacity [22]. \n\nNLCs are composed of a blend of solid lipids and liquid lipids in a suitable proportion. Presence of liquid lipids in solid matrix provide immobilization of drug and prevent the particle aggregation, due to solid matrix and therefore, inhibit expulsion of the drug [23,24]. Besides, the presence of liquid lipids increases the lipid matrix imperfections that lead to higher drug entrapment as compared to SLNs [18,25,26]. \n\nNLC can improve and enhance the oral bioavailability of loaded drugs by one or more of the following mechanisms: \n\n(1) The mucoadhesion properties of NLCs to the intestinal wall; \n\n(2) Emulsifying properties of surfactants used in formulation improve the permeability and solubility of the drug through the gastrointestinal tract membrane; (3) The nanosize of NLCs contributes to the enterocyte's surface to increase. Consequently, improve and enhance drug permeability across the intestinal membrane [27,28].",

Anwar, H. Dawaba, M. Afouna, A. Samy, Mohammed H Rashed, Abdelaziz E Abdelaziz\n## Abstract\nCandesartan Cilexetil (CC) is a prodrug widely used in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure, but it has some limitations, such as very poor aqueous solubility, high affinity to P-glycoprotein efflux mechanism, and hepatic first-pass metabolism. Therefore, it has very low oral bioavailability. In this study, glyceryl monostearate (GMS) and Capryol\u2122 90 were selected as solid and liquid lipids, respectively, to develop CC-NLC (nanostructured lipid carrier). CC was successfully encapsulated into NLP (CC-NLC) to enhance its oral bioavailability. CC-NLC was formulated using a hot homogenization-ultrasonication technique, and the physicochemical properties were characterized. The developed CC-NLC formulation was showed in nanometric size (121.6 \u00b1 6.2 nm) with high encapsulation efficiency (96.23 \u00b1 3.14%). Furthermore, it appeared almost spherical in morphology under a transmission electron microscope. The surgical experiment of the designed CC-NLC for absorption from the gastrointestinal tract revealed that CC-NLC absorption in the stomach was only 15.26% of that in the intestine. Otherwise, cellular uptake study exhibit that CC-NLCs should be internalized through the enterocytes after that transported through the systemic circulation. The pharmacokinetic results indicated that the oral bioavailability of CC was remarkably improved above 2-fold after encapsulation into nanostructured lipid carriers. These results ensured that nanostructured lipid carriers have a highly beneficial effect on improving the oral bioavailability of poorly water-soluble drugs, such as CC.\n## Introduction\nThe lipid-based nanoparticulate systems LNS were stated as a replacement drug delivery system to conventional polymeric nanoparticles [19,20]. \n\nThe advantages of lipid-based nanoparticulate systems over the polymeric nanoparticles depend on the unique lipid matrix composition, such as biocompatibility, biodegradability, protection of the encapsulated compound against enzymatic degradation [21], possibility incorporation both lipophilic and hydrophilic drugs, high entrapment efficiency, easy to scale-up and controlled release of drugs [18,19]. \n\nBesides, lipid-based nanoparticles are nanosized drug delivery system, which possesses the advantages of polymeric nanoparticles, liposomes, and emulsion. \n\nNanostructured lipid carriers are the second generation of lipid-based nanoparticles. NLCs were developed to solve the drawbacks of SLNs. Therefore, NLCs vary from SLNs by the feature of being smaller in size, better shelf-life stability, and better drug loading capacity [22]. \n\nNLCs are composed of a blend of solid lipids and liquid lipids in a suitable proportion. Presence of liquid lipids in solid matrix provide immobilization of drug and prevent the particle aggregation, due to solid matrix and therefore, inhibit expulsion of the drug [23,24]. Besides, the presence of liquid lipids increases the lipid matrix imperfections that lead to higher drug entrapment as compared to SLNs [18,25,26]. \n\nNLC can improve and enhance the oral bioavailability of loaded drugs by one or more of the following mechanisms: \n\n(1) The mucoadhesion properties of NLCs to the intestinal wall; \n\n(2) Emulsifying properties of surfactants used in formulation improve the permeability and solubility of the drug through the gastrointestinal tract membrane; (3) The nanosize of NLCs contributes to the enterocyte's surface to increase. Consequently, improve and enhance drug permeability across the intestinal membrane [27,28].",

When compared to typical colloidal carriers, SLNs have numerous advantages, including reduced toxicity, a high surface area, delayed drug release, greater cellular absorption, and the capacity to improve drug solubility and bioavailability. 39,40 This is what Pfizer BioNTech used in their most recent creation of a Nano type vaccine. The drug release from SLNs is determined by the matrix type and the drug's placement in the formulation. SLNs made from biodegradable and biocompatible materials can include both hydrophilic and lipophilic bioactive, making them a feasible choice for controlled and targeted drug delivery. 40 The drug is usually disseminated or dissolved in the solid core of SLNs, which is hydrophobic with a monolayer coating of phospholipids (see Scheme 2). 39,40 LNPs are nano-vectors developed to replace liposomes, lipid emulsions, and polymeric nanoparticles as colloidal drug delivery vehicles. SLNPs offer a chance to develop novel therapeutic prototypes for drug delivery and targeting, because of their unique size dependent features and capacity to load medicines. Many academics throughout the world are interested in SLNPs because they have a lot of potential for achieving the objective of targeted and regulated medication delivery.",

Safer, S. Leporatti\n## Abstract\nAbstract Chitosan has been investigated in several biological fields, including drug and gene delivery, tissue engineering antiviral and immunological adjuvant methods. It\u2019s a cationic copolymer of N-acetyl glucosamine and D-glucosamine with different molecular chain lengths, compositions, and sequences than N-acetyl glucosamine and D-glucosamine. It is biocompatible and cyto-compatible, as well as recyclable and bioresorbable. As effective drug delivery methods, chitosan nanoparticles are shaped into several pathways. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of its antiviral application as a nanocarrier for antiviral medications, highlighting the benefits, limitations, and downsides. In this review, we will report the most recent COVID-19 vaccination advances. It will also be discussed what the future holds for chitosan nanoparticles in the treatment of coronaviruses.\n## BioNTech/Pfizer Vaccine Contains Solid Nano Lipids\nSolid lipid nanoparticles (SLNPs) were first developed in 1991 with the goal of providing biocompatibility, storage stability, and the prevention of drug degradation. 39 SLNPs are nanoscopic colloidal carriers (50-1000 nm) that have been created to address the flaws of conventional colloidal carriers (eg, polymer degradation and cytotoxicity, lack of a suitable large scale production method, inferior stability, drug leakage and fusion, phospholipid degradation, high production cost 39 ). When compared to typical colloidal carriers, SLNs have numerous advantages, including reduced toxicity, a high surface area, delayed drug release, greater cellular absorption, and the capacity to improve drug solubility and bioavailability. 39,40 This is what Pfizer BioNTech used in their most recent creation of a Nano type vaccine. The drug release from SLNs is determined by the matrix type and the drug's placement in the formulation. SLNs made from biodegradable and biocompatible materials can include both hydrophilic and lipophilic bioactive, making them a feasible choice for controlled and targeted drug delivery. 40 The drug is usually disseminated or dissolved in the solid core of SLNs, which is hydrophobic with a monolayer coating of phospholipids (see Scheme 2). 39,40 LNPs are nano-vectors developed to replace liposomes, lipid emulsions, and polymeric nanoparticles as colloidal drug delivery vehicles. SLNPs offer a chance to develop novel therapeutic prototypes for drug delivery and targeting, because of their unique size dependent features and capacity to load medicines. Many academics throughout the world are interested in SLNPs because they have a lot of potential for achieving the objective of targeted and regulated medication delivery.",

            "abstract": "Numerous drugs have emerged to treat various diseases, such as COVID-19, cancer, and protect human health. Approximately 40% of them are lipophilic and are used for treating diseases through various delivery routes, including skin absorption, oral administration, and injection. However, as lipophilic drugs have a low solubility in the human body, drug delivery systems (DDSs) are being actively developed to increase drug bioavailability. Liposomes, micro-sponges, and polymer-based nanoparticles have been proposed as DDS carriers for lipophilic drugs. However, their instability, cytotoxicity, and lack of targeting ability limit their commercialization. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have fewer side effects, excellent biocompatibility, and high physical stability. LNPs are considered efficient vehicles of lipophilic drugs owing to their lipid-based internal structure. In addition, recent LNP studies suggest that the bioavailability of LNP can be increased through surface modifications, such as PEGylation, chitosan, and surfactant protein coating. Thus, their combinations have an abundant utilization potential in the fields of DDSs for carrying lipophilic drugs. In this review, the functions and efficiencies of various types of LNPs and surface modifications developed to optimize lipophilic drug delivery are discussed.",

                    "text": "Thus, many researchers have focused on the possibility of treating various diseases using LCCs [20,21]. Numerous studies have been conducted to improve the bioavailability of liposomes, such as drug loading, increased residence time in the body, extrusion to ensure uniform size, and antibody-based targeting [22,23]. These efforts have led to clinical trials in various medical fields, including liposomebased anticancer drugs, antibiotics, gene therapy, and anesthetics [20]. Currently, many liposome-based treatments, such as Doxyl \u00ae (doxorubicin), AmBisome \u00ae (Amphotericin B), and daunoXome \u00ae (daunorubicin), have been approved and used in medicine [24]. However, the high production cost, limited physical stability, low drug-loading capacity, leakage of encapsulated drugs, and complexity and use of toxic organic solvents in the manufacturing process restrict the commercialization of liposomes [25,26]. This situation requires a new alternative; thus, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) were developed as novel LCCs to overcome the limitations of liposomes [21,25]. LNPs comprise lipids, surfactants, polymers, and emulsions or colloidal nanoparticle structures [27,28]. Unlike liposomes, LNPs mainly consist of phospholipids, a surfactantbased monolayer, and an interior filled with hydrophobic materials (Figure 1) [24]. The synthesis of LNPs is more straightforward to scale up than that of liposomes because they are produced by emulsification between an organic phase and an aqueous phase using the properties of surfactants [29,30]. In addition, they have many advantages, such as a low cytotoxicity, low cost, high stability, and drug-loading efficiency [6]. Previous studies on LNP preparation, characterization, drug loading, and delivery have demonstrated their great potential as a DDS. Generally, drugs are loaded in the carrier during the manufacturing process. Thus, their hydrophobic internal structural characteristics make them suitable for lipophilic drug delivery.",

Yoo, Taek Lee\n## Abstract\nNumerous drugs have emerged to treat various diseases, such as COVID-19, cancer, and protect human health. Approximately 40% of them are lipophilic and are used for treating diseases through various delivery routes, including skin absorption, oral administration, and injection. However, as lipophilic drugs have a low solubility in the human body, drug delivery systems (DDSs) are being actively developed to increase drug bioavailability. Liposomes, micro-sponges, and polymer-based nanoparticles have been proposed as DDS carriers for lipophilic drugs. However, their instability, cytotoxicity, and lack of targeting ability limit their commercialization. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have fewer side effects, excellent biocompatibility, and high physical stability. LNPs are considered efficient vehicles of lipophilic drugs owing to their lipid-based internal structure. In addition, recent LNP studies suggest that the bioavailability of LNP can be increased through surface modifications, such as PEGylation, chitosan, and surfactant protein coating. Thus, their combinations have an abundant utilization potential in the fields of DDSs for carrying lipophilic drugs. In this review, the functions and efficiencies of various types of LNPs and surface modifications developed to optimize lipophilic drug delivery are discussed.\n## Introduction\nThus, many researchers have focused on the possibility of treating various diseases using LCCs [20,21]. Numerous studies have been conducted to improve the bioavailability of liposomes, such as drug loading, increased residence time in the body, extrusion to ensure uniform size, and antibody-based targeting [22,23]. These efforts have led to clinical trials in various medical fields, including liposomebased anticancer drugs, antibiotics, gene therapy, and anesthetics [20]. Currently, many liposome-based treatments, such as Doxyl \u00ae (doxorubicin), AmBisome \u00ae (Amphotericin B), and daunoXome \u00ae (daunorubicin), have been approved and used in medicine [24]. However, the high production cost, limited physical stability, low drug-loading capacity, leakage of encapsulated drugs, and complexity and use of toxic organic solvents in the manufacturing process restrict the commercialization of liposomes [25,26]. This situation requires a new alternative; thus, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) were developed as novel LCCs to overcome the limitations of liposomes [21,25]. LNPs comprise lipids, surfactants, polymers, and emulsions or colloidal nanoparticle structures [27,28]. Unlike liposomes, LNPs mainly consist of phospholipids, a surfactantbased monolayer, and an interior filled with hydrophobic materials (Figure 1) [24]. The synthesis of LNPs is more straightforward to scale up than that of liposomes because they are produced by emulsification between an organic phase and an aqueous phase using the properties of surfactants [29,30]. In addition, they have many advantages, such as a low cytotoxicity, low cost, high stability, and drug-loading efficiency [6]. Previous studies on LNP preparation, characterization, drug loading, and delivery have demonstrated their great potential as a DDS. Generally, drugs are loaded in the carrier during the manufacturing process. Thus, their hydrophobic internal structural characteristics make them suitable for lipophilic drug delivery.",

Patro\n## Abstract\nTyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are used as targeted therapy for cancer by inhibiting the signaling pathway and tumor growth. Many TKIs got approved by FDA in recent times for the treatment of cancer by oral route. However, the TKIs have formulation challenges leading to compromised bioavailability which can cause a weak therapeutic response. The cancer nanotherapeutics using nanocarriers based drug delivery has emerged as an advanced tool to provide a solution to formulation challenges and a better cancer therapy by overcoming the limitations in conventional cancer therapy. This review describes the various formulation issues of anticancer drugs with a special reference to TKIs, as well as the capability of solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) for an efficient nano targeted cancer drug delivery.\n## Advantages of SLNs\nThe SLNs have excellent biocompatibility and low toxicity. The lipophilic drugs are better delivered by SLNs. 55 he SLNs are made from physiologically compatible lipids. SLNs also show less cytotoxicity as compared to the polymeric nanoparticles. 56 easibility of large scale production, high product stability, biodegradability, increased entrapment efficiency, controlled drug release, drug targeting by surface modification are the advantages of SLNs over the liposomes and polymeric nanoparticles. 57 LNs also show controlled drug release by the degradation, erosion, or diffusion of the lipid matrix. 53 he SLNs, can deliver the TKIs, with enhanced bioavailability and decreased resistance. Combination drug delivery with targeted therapy also possible. 10 Lipid based nano carriers such as, SLNs can improve the limitations of conventional anticancer treatment by highly capable anticancer drugs in terms of therapeutic activity and functionality. 53",

This review presents a broad treatment of solid lipid nanoparticles discussing their advantages, limitations and their possible remedies. The different types of nanocarriers which were based on solid lipid like solid lipid nanoparticles, nanostructured lipid carriers, lipid drug conjugates are discussed with their structural differences. Different production methods which are suitable for large scale production and applications of solid lipid nanoparticles are described. Appropriate analytical techniques for characterization of solid lipid nanoparticles like photon correlation spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry are highlighted. Aspects of solid lipid nanoparticles route of administration and their biodistribution are also incorporated. If appropriately investigated,solid lipid nanoparticles may open new vistas in therapy of complex diseases. \n\u00a0\n## INTRODUCTION:\nolloidal particles ranging in size between 10 and 1000 nm are known as nanoparticles.They are manufactured from synthetic/natural polymers and ideally suited to optimize drug delivery and reduce toxicity.Over the years, they have emerged as a variable substitute to liposomes as drug carriers.The successful implementation of nanoparticles for drug delivery depends on their ability to penetrate through several anatomical barriers, sustained release of their contents and their stability in the nanometer size.However, the scarcity of safe polymers with regulatory approval and their high cost have limited the wide spread application of nanoparticles to clinical medicine 1 .To overcome these limitations of polymeric nanoparticles, lipids have been put forward as an alternative carrier, particularly for lipophilic pharmaceuticals.These lipid nanoparticles are known as solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), which are attracting wide attention of formulators world-wide 2 .SLNs are colloidal carriers developed in the last decade as an alternative system to the existing traditional carriers (emulsions, liposomes and polymeric nanoparticles).They are a new generation of submicron-sized lipid emulsions where the liquid lipid (oil) has been substituted by a solid lipid.SLN offer unique properties such as small size, large surface area, high drug loading and the interaction of phases at the",

Despite their development over the past several decades, this technology is still hindered by issues with the manufacturing processes leading to high polydispersity, batch-to-batch and operator-dependent variability, and limits to the production volumes. To overcome these issues, the use of microfluidic techniques in the production of LBNPs has sharply increased over the past two years. Microfluidics overcomes many of the pitfalls seen with conventional production methods, leading to reproducible LBNPs at lower costs and higher yields. In this review, the use of microfluidics in the preparation of various types of LBNPs, including liposomes, lipid nanoparticles, and solid lipid nanoparticles for the delivery of small molecules, oligonucleotides, and peptide/protein drugs is summarized. Various microfluidic parameters, as well as their effects on the physicochemical properties of LBNPs, are also discussed.",

Vogelaar, Samantha Marcotte, Jiaqi Cheng, Benazir Oluoch, J. Zaro\n## Abstract\nLipid-based nanoparticles (LBNPs) are an important tool for the delivery of a diverse set of drug cargoes, including small molecules, oligonucleotides, and proteins and peptides. Despite their development over the past several decades, this technology is still hindered by issues with the manufacturing processes leading to high polydispersity, batch-to-batch and operator-dependent variability, and limits to the production volumes. To overcome these issues, the use of microfluidic techniques in the production of LBNPs has sharply increased over the past two years. Microfluidics overcomes many of the pitfalls seen with conventional production methods, leading to reproducible LBNPs at lower costs and higher yields. In this review, the use of microfluidics in the preparation of various types of LBNPs, including liposomes, lipid nanoparticles, and solid lipid nanoparticles for the delivery of small molecules, oligonucleotides, and peptide/protein drugs is summarized. Various microfluidic parameters, as well as their effects on the physicochemical properties of LBNPs, are also discussed.\n## Introduction\nLipid-based nanoparticles (LBNPs), defined as 10-1000 nm nanoparticles composed of lipids as the main structural component, are versatile drug delivery systems (DDSs) as they can encapsulate a variety of drug cargos and selectively target cell/tissues by modification of the outer components.These types of nanosystems, including lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs), have the advantages of protecting the cargo from degradation, allowing lower doses/toxic side effects, enhancing the solubility and therefore bioavailability of hydrophobic molecules, and being biocompatible/biodegradable [1].Although LNPs were recently brought into the spotlight worldwide due to the emergence of the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, lipid-based delivery systems have been studied since the 1960s with the discovery of liposomes.Liposomes are the earliest form of LBNPs and are composed of selfformed closed lipid bilayer vesicles with an aqueous core [2].This technology has led to the development of many Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs, starting with Doxil \u00ae in 1995.Due to the complicated production methods, low encapsulation efficiency, and limitations in the physicochemical properties of the drugs that could be incorporated, other types of lipid-based carriers were developed.",

Due to the low solubility and short half-life of RDV in the blood, an injectable formulation was prepared using sulphobutylether-beta-cyclodextrin. However, it can accumulate in the kidney and cause renal impairment. NLCs improve the parenteral delivery of hydrophobic drugs such as RDV by increasing drug solubility and bioavailability. For the synthesis of RDV-NLCs, the aqueous phase containing Tween 80 was injected into the lipid phase under rapid stirring and was sonicated. The experimental conditions were optimized using Box-Behnken design and Design Expert software. The optimum formulation contained a total lipid of 2.13%, a total surfactant of 1%, and a hot bath time of 71 min. The optimum formulation showed particle size, polydispersity index, zeta potential, and entrapment efficiency values of 151.0\u2009\u00b1\u20091.7 nm (from 149.1 to 152.1), 0.4\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1 (from 0.3 to 0.5), \u221243.8\u2009\u00b1\u20091.2 mV (from \u221242.4 to \u221244.7), and 81.34\u2009\u00b1\u20091.57% (from 79.52 to 82.33%), respectively.

Ghourchian\n## Abstract\nThe aim of this study was to synthesize and evaluate nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) loaded with Remdesivir (RDV) to control its side effects in COVID-19 patients. Due to the low solubility and short half-life of RDV in the blood, an injectable formulation was prepared using sulphobutylether-beta-cyclodextrin. However, it can accumulate in the kidney and cause renal impairment. NLCs improve the parenteral delivery of hydrophobic drugs such as RDV by increasing drug solubility and bioavailability. For the synthesis of RDV-NLCs, the aqueous phase containing Tween 80 was injected into the lipid phase under rapid stirring and was sonicated. The experimental conditions were optimized using Box-Behnken design and Design Expert software. The optimum formulation contained a total lipid of 2.13%, a total surfactant of 1%, and a hot bath time of 71 min. The optimum formulation showed particle size, polydispersity index, zeta potential, and entrapment efficiency values of 151.0\u2009\u00b1\u20091.7 nm (from 149.1 to 152.1), 0.4\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1 (from 0.3 to 0.5), \u221243.8\u2009\u00b1\u20091.2 mV (from \u221242.4 to \u221244.7), and 81.34\u2009\u00b1\u20091.57% (from 79.52 to 82.33%), respectively. RDV-NLCs showed acceptable stability for 30 days at 25 \u2103 and were compatible with commonly used intravenous infusion fluids for 48 h. FE-SEM images of RDV-NLC showed spherical particles with a mean diameter of 207 nm. The NLC-RDV formulation showed a sustained release of RDV with a low risk of dose-dumping, minimizing potential side effects. In addition, RDV in the form of RDV-NLC causes less cytotoxicity to healthy normal kidney cells, which is expected to reduce renal impairment in COVID-19 patients.\n## body\nTherefore, an efficient alternative formulation for better delivery of RDV with minimum side effects is required. \n\nNanosized drug-carrier systems have been developed in the past decades and are divided into polymeric and lipid nanoparticles 10 .

The advent of pharmaceutical nanotechnology has allowed an arsenal of drugs with poor stability, low solubility, high off-target toxicity and other disadvantageous features, to be accessible as pharmaceutical products that could be administered to a patient. Nanotechnology was introduced in drug delivery very long ago, but has flourished with unprecedented intensity during the last twenty years and now a diversity of nano-based preparations are at clinical stage of development or already available in the market. Undoubtedly, nanotechnology plays a key role in future pharmaceutical development and pharmacotherapy. In the first part of this review, we have already discussed recent (2008-2012) patents on linear polymer-based nanosystems (nanogels, nanospheres and nanocapsules) applications to cancer therapy. Here, we have expanded such analysis to branched polymers (dendrimers), self-assembling nanomicelles and lipid-based nanocarriers.",

Therefore, there is a need to develop alternative nanocarriers based on lipid components. It is hoped that these drug carriers will allow higher control over drug release and delivery of therapeutics which may not efficiently load into LP. Between the variety of lipid carriers, Nanostructured Lipid Carriers (NLC) and Solid Lipid Nanoparticles (SLN) have been developed and used as parenteral drug delivery systems, especially in cancer chemotherapy [313,314]. SLN were developed in the middle of the 1990s, by replacing the liquid lipid (oil) of an oil-in-water nanoemulsion by a solid lipid or a blend of solid lipids [315]. The use of solid lipids instead of oils is a very attractive idea to achieve controlled drug release, since the drug molecule mobility in a solid matrix should be intuitively lower compared with an oily phase [118]. SLN have a diameter approximately between 50 and 1000 nm [316]. Moreover, large-scale manufacturing of SLN is possible (while other systems such as polymeric nanoparticles have faced scalingup issues), and solvent use can be avoided using highpressure homogenization with extant machinery [5,117,118]. A couple of limitations to the use of SLN come from their limited loading capacity because of the formation of a highly ordered, perfect lipid crystal matrix [317]. After preparation, at least some of the particles crystallize in higher energy modifications that, during storage, evolve to low energy, more ordered modifications that lead to drug expulsion [117]. These drawbacks have been solved by second generation lipid nanoparticles, NLC, in which the solid lipids are blended with oils.",

Dendrimers, micelles, lipid-based nanosystems).\n# Venue: Recent Patents on Anti-Cancer Drug Discovery\n# Authors: M. E. Ruiz, M. Gantner, A. Talevi\n## Abstract\nThe great efforts of many researchers have brought down some of the barriers that exist to turn a good in vitro compound into a potential in vivo drug. The advent of pharmaceutical nanotechnology has allowed an arsenal of drugs with poor stability, low solubility, high off-target toxicity and other disadvantageous features, to be accessible as pharmaceutical products that could be administered to a patient. Nanotechnology was introduced in drug delivery very long ago, but has flourished with unprecedented intensity during the last twenty years and now a diversity of nano-based preparations are at clinical stage of development or already available in the market. Undoubtedly, nanotechnology plays a key role in future pharmaceutical development and pharmacotherapy. In the first part of this review, we have already discussed recent (2008-2012) patents on linear polymer-based nanosystems (nanogels, nanospheres and nanocapsules) applications to cancer therapy. Here, we have expanded such analysis to branched polymers (dendrimers), self-assembling nanomicelles and lipid-based nanocarriers.\n## Solid Lipid Nanoparticles\nLP have some important drawbacks: they are manufactured through processes that involve organic solvents, they are unstable in biological fluids and more generally in aqueous solutions (they cannot be commercialized as such), and they present poor batch-to-batch reproducibility and difficul-ties in sterilization [311,312]. Therefore, there is a need to develop alternative nanocarriers based on lipid components. It is hoped that these drug carriers will allow higher control over drug release and delivery of therapeutics which may not efficiently load into LP. Between the variety of lipid carriers, Nanostructured Lipid Carriers (NLC) and Solid Lipid Nanoparticles (SLN) have been developed and used as parenteral drug delivery systems, especially in cancer chemotherapy [313,314]. SLN were developed in the middle of the 1990s, by replacing the liquid lipid (oil) of an oil-in-water nanoemulsion by a solid lipid or a blend of solid lipids [315]. The use of solid lipids instead of oils is a very attractive idea to achieve controlled drug release, since the drug molecule mobility in a solid matrix should be intuitively lower compared with an oily phase [118]. SLN have a diameter approximately between 50 and 1000 nm [316]. Moreover, large-scale manufacturing of SLN is possible (while other systems such as polymeric nanoparticles have faced scalingup issues), and solvent use can be avoided using highpressure homogenization with extant machinery [5,117,118]. A couple of limitations to the use of SLN come from their limited loading capacity because of the formation of a highly ordered, perfect lipid crystal matrix [317]. After preparation, at least some of the particles crystallize in higher energy modifications that, during storage, evolve to low energy, more ordered modifications that lead to drug expulsion [117]. These drawbacks have been solved by second generation lipid nanoparticles, NLC, in which the solid lipids are blended with oils.",

These systems are able to protect and target drugs to specific sites, allowing for a reduction in peripheral toxicity and an increase in therapeutic benefits [110,111]. So far, different nanoparticulate carriers have been used for these purposes, such as lipid nanoparticles, polymeric nanoparticles, and inorganic nanoparticles, among others [112]. Recent studies have shown particular interest in lipid nanoparticles, as they show advantages over other types of nanoparticles, including biodegradability, biocompatibility, low toxicity, scale-up capacity, and prolonged drug delivery [111]. In general, lipid nanoparticles include liposomes and solid lipid matrix nanoparticles, specifically solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC), though different nomination for lipid-based nanoparticles can be found elsewhere [109]. Nonetheless, although liposomes have been developed earlier and there are already some products approved for clinical use, liposome-based formulations show stability problems and the raw materials are expensive [113,114]. Therefore, SLN and NLC arise as a promising alternative, as they can overcome these limitations and have proven to be effective drug delivery systems. Their success can be demonstrated by the exponential increase in scientific publications on these systems [109,110]. In particular, publications from 2015 to date have increased from 682 to 1113 in PubMed (61.3%) and from 1141 to 2773 in Scopus (41.1%), which are remarkable numbers if we consider that the total period of publications on SLN is around 30 years, and on NLC around 20 years. SLN were the first generation of solid lipid-based carrier systems with sizes in the nanometer range and ability to encapsulate lipophilic drugs [115].",

Recent studies have shown particular interest in lipid nanoparticles, as they show advantages over other types of nanoparticles, including biodegradability, biocompatibility, low toxicity, scale-up capacity, and prolonged drug delivery [111]. In general, lipid nanoparticles include liposomes and solid lipid matrix nanoparticles, specifically solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC), though different nomination for lipid-based nanoparticles can be found elsewhere [109]. Nonetheless, although liposomes have been developed earlier and there are already some products approved for clinical use, liposome-based formulations show stability problems and the raw materials are expensive [113,114]. Therefore, SLN and NLC arise as a promising alternative, as they can overcome these limitations and have proven to be effective drug delivery systems. Their success can be demonstrated by the exponential increase in scientific publications on these systems [109,110]. In particular, publications from 2015 to date have increased from 682 to 1113 in PubMed (61.3%) and from 1141 to 2773 in Scopus (41.1%), which are remarkable numbers if we consider that the total period of publications on SLN is around 30 years, and on NLC around 20 years. SLN were the first generation of solid lipid-based carrier systems with sizes in the nanometer range and ability to encapsulate lipophilic drugs [115].",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been widely investigated as drug delivery systems for enhancing drug bioavailability and targeting therapeutic and diagnostic agents to pathological sites such as brain and solid tumors [1,2,3,4,5,6].The recent introduction to clinics of RNAi and mRNA-based medicinal products using LNPs [7,8] has highlighted the enormous potential of lipid carriers as drug delivery systems for both large biomacromolecules like nucleic acid and peptides, as well as small molecule drugs.However, LNPs comprise a diverse range of nanometer carriers composed of lipid molecules.Indeed, due to the broad definition of lipids according to IUPAC [9], LNPs encompass various structurally different nanoscale carriers, including liposomes, liquid LNPs, solid LNPs, nanostructured lipid carriers, and cationic lipid-nucleic acid complexes [4].\n\nLNPs for drug delivery have the advantage of using GRAS materials [10] and industrial-scale production protocols [4], which increases the likelihood of developing effective nanotechnology-based medicine for clinical use.However, the lack of a deep and comprehensive understanding of the LNP structure hinders the rational, safe and effective design of these drug carriers.The effectiveness and safety of LNPs are not only influenced by the lipids in their formulation and the amount of drug they can hold but also by various factors such as their size, shape, surface chemistry, internal structure, and drug distribution.Careful analysis of the entire system is essential in comprehending the nano-bio interface, which is accountable for the safety and efficacy of nanotechnology-based medication.[11].\n\nSolid LNPs are a type of drug delivery and targeting carriers that have shown great promise due to their stability over time.Compared to other lipid-based delivery systems like liposomes and nanoemulsions, solid LNPs have the solid-state stability of the core that is less prone to problems such as drug leakage/degradation and particle coalescence.",

In the next generation of the lipid nanoparticle, NLCs are modified SLNs which improve the stability and capacity loading. Three structural models of NLCs have been proposed. These LNPs have potential applications in drug delivery field, research, cosmetics, clinical medicine, etc. This article focuses on features, structure and innovation of LNPs and presents a wide discussion about preparation methods, advantages, disadvantages and applications of LNPs by focusing on SLNs and NLCs.",

Liposomes are the first nano system approved for protein and drug delivery [37]. LNPs originate from liposomes that deliver small-molecule drugs and are cationic, spherical vesicles. They are composed of phospholipids and cholesterol [38]. They demonstrate high biocompatibility and can enter the cytoplasm through natural biological processes like membrane fusion, owing to the phospholipid bilayer of the plasma membrane [39]. LNPs have been shown to reduce drug toxicity, enhance drug stability, and improve drug bioavailability [40]. Studies have indicated that LNPs are effective immune stimulators in mRNA-based vaccine delivery and enhance the efficacy of protein subunit vaccines [41,42]. Many LNPs-based siRNA drugs have entered the clinical trial stage [43]. However, LNPs also have some disadvantages, such as their complex composition, relatively lower stability, and targeting efficacy [44,45]. Leakage may occur when loaded with drugs, and increasing the dose can have toxic side effects on the organism [46]. Additionally, emulsifiers that produce toxicity to the body further limit the potential application of cationic NPs [47].",

Lipid-based nanocarriers or nanoparticles (LNPs) have various favourable properties, making them an ideal choice. LNPs are characteristically spherical and possess a lipid solid core with a matrix containing soluble lipophilic molecules. As cell membranes are mainly composed of lipids and phospholipids, lipid-based nanocarriers as a drug transport have the natural advantage of better interaction with cells, and therefore facilitating better cellular uptake of transported drug [74]. Furthermore, lipid nanoparticle materials are biocompatible and biodegradable [75]. Several notable classes of lipid-based nanocarriers have been studied for RNA delivery, including liposomes, solid lipid-based nanoparticles, nanostructured lipid carriers, lipidoid nanoparticles, lipophilic conjugates, transfersomes, lipospheres and nanoemulsions. [14,76,77]. It is important to note that there are many other lipid-based carrier systems out there; however, Table 1 summarises some of them and their advantages. Positively charged carriers that include stable nucleic acid-lipid particles (SNALPs) and solid-lipid nanoparticles (SLNs). SNALPs are made from a lipid bilayer containing cationic and fusogenic lipids, stabilised with a diffusible polyethylene glycol-lipid (PEG-lipid) while SLNs consist of natural components of protein-free low-density lipoproteins (LDLs). \n\nProtection against harsh environmental situations Ease of large-scale production Nanostructured lipid carriers [75,76] Second generation SLNs formed from a mixture of solid and liquid lipids resulting in an unstructured-matrix due to the different moieties of the constituents.",

            "text": "delivery of nucleic acids into cells makes them superior to other carriers. Since biological membranes and nucleic acids are negatively charged, it is difficult to deliver mRNA across this barrier. LNPs offer an ideal platform for delivering nucleic acid therapies as the ionizable lipids are nearneutrally charged at physiological pH. However, in acidic endosomal compartments (pH-4.5), they become ionized, promoting endosomal escape for effective intracellular delivery [46,47]. Hence, LNPs achieve high encapsulation rate for nucleic acids with improved transfection efficiency. Furthermore, LNPs have relatively low cytotoxicity and immunogenicity compared to liposomes, thus favoring delivery of nucleic acid based therapeutics [48][49][50].\n\nLipids used in formulating these nanoparticles are biocompatible and are well endured by fatty acids, triglycerides, waxes and steroids. In addition, selecting a good combination of emulsifiers could  make the formulation more stable with higher efficiency [52]. In terms of industrial scale up, LNPs offer multiple advantages compared with other carrier systems, such as large scale production using microfluidics or T-junction mixing, stability, and low cost of raw materials [52][53][54]. The most significant parameters in LNPs characterization are particle size, their size distribution, degree of polymorphism, zeta potential, crystallinity, drug loading, drug release and entrapment efficiency [55]. Drug release from LNPs mostly relies on the type of matrix used and the position of drug in the matrix formulation. The ingredients of lipid matrix, manufacturing parameters and surfactant concentrations, such as rate of stirring, temperature etc. can modulate the drug release profile [56]. In a nutshell, the most fundamental rationale of using LNPs, as an alternative to polymeric nanoparticles, is the simplicity of largescale manufacturing and their low toxicity [57,58].",

            "text": "Versatile nano-platforms have been investigated to deliver mRNA in the body, including LNPs, polymer-based nanoparticles, polymer-lipid hybrid nanoparticles, poly-peptides, protein derivatives mRNA complexes, and gold nanoparticles [16,19]. Among these vectors, LNPs are the most commonly used due to the relative ease of large scaled manufacture, their ability to deliver the encapsulated mRNA to ribosomes (via endosome escape), and flexibility for surface modification with a ligand for specific cell targeting, for example to enhance the uptake into dendritic cells [5,18]. LNPs are versatile drug delivery systems that have been investigated to tackle various disease, including infection and cancer [21]. As LNPs consist of at least one synthetic or natural lipid layer and an aqueous, oil, solid, or amorphous core [22], hydrophilic molecules, such as mRNA, small interference RNA (siRNA) and proteins can be entrapped within the LNP aqueous core, whereas lipophilic compounds can be incorporated into the lipid layers [18]. Thus, LNPs can be co-loaded with an immunopotentiator, also known as adjuvants, to enhance the immune response of the mRNA vaccine. The choice of LNPs for mRNA vaccine delivery has shifted from traditional liposomes, lipoplexes, and cationic nanoemulsions, to more advanced solid nanoparticles and nanostructured lipid carriers [20]. LNPs were employed not only by BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, but also by other mRNA vaccines in the development of delivery carriers, which are listed in Table 1.",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) lie within the family of lipid-based nanoparticles, which also includes liposomes, and other nanoscale lipid complexes. What differentiates LNPs from other lipid-based nanoparticle formats is the presence of a solid core created from nucleic acid complexed to a permanent or ionisable cationic lipid. 2][3] The COVID-19 pandemic placed LNPs in the spotlight, hugely increasing interest and recognition of their potential in drug and vaccine delivery, which is evidenced by a doubling of published literature on LNPs in the last 5 years. 4 ptimising LNP manufacture has emerged as valuable research, especially concerning production speeds, scalability, stability and efficacy of the end product. 5,6 The growth of this field is driven by challenges faced during the rapid mass production of LNP-based mRNA vaccines during the pandemic. One of the biggest challenges was producing formulations rapidly to meet demand. Furthermore, manufacturing formu-lation parameters have been widely explored in the field of liposomes, 7,8 so translating this research to LNPs is valuable. In addition to optimisation of the manufacturing process, testing the robustness of parameters used is vital, as this aids in understanding the formulation, as well as defining the limits within formulations, and expands the knowledge base in nanomedicine formulation strategy. For example, there is evidence that size impacts LNP immunogenicity and mRNA expression, impacting therapeutic efficacy. 3,9,10 However, the impact varies based on the indication and pharmacokinetics; while larger LNPs (>100 d.nm) may have higher mRNA expression, 10 there is evidence that smaller LNPs (<100 d nm) are more readily absorbed from the injection site. 9 icrofluidics is a precise, reproducible, and scalable method for manufacturing LNPs. It has easily adjustable parameters, which can be precisely controlled with relative ease in comparison with other methods of LNP manufacturing. 11 arameters, such as mixing speed and flow-rate ratio, can significantly impact the critical quality attributes of the produced LNPs.",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have emerged as a critical tool in the treatment of genetic/hereditary disorders, infectious diseases, and cancers, among other illnesses. LNP systems have been established to yield a safe and efficacious delivery of nucleic acid and small molecule drugs to target cells in the body. The worldwide use of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines has ensured wide acceptability within scientific and regulatory bodies. Such systems have therefore drawn immense attention from academia and industry alike. For example, a search on clinicaltrials.gov reveals a sizeable number of ongoing clinical trials on LNP products. A list of these trials is presented in Table 1. \n\nAs seen from the sheer number of currently ongoing clinical studies (Table 1), LNPs are a field of \"hot pursuit\" for the delivery of nucleic acids, small molecules, and other drug cargos. This highlights the importance of gaining insights into LNP drug delivery systems. \n\nLipid-based delivery systems have come a long way over several decades since their first discovery and use as liposomes, which are lipidic bilayer vesicles broadly encapsulating hydrophobic drugs in the bilayer and hydrophilic drugs in the vesicular core. Liposomes are formed by liquid-crystalline lipid bilayers and have been prepared by complex production methods. To simply the manufacturing process and add rigidity to lipid vesicles, solid lipids were incorporated into the system to form solid lipid nanoparticles. Mixtures of solid and liquid crystalline lipids were used to form nanostructured lipid carriers. Then, with the requirement of incorporating a charged drug cargo, countercharged lipid exploration was initiated in lipid nanostructured delivery systems and the need for less toxic nanocarriers brought about the use of ionizable lipids. The quest for an enhancement in endosomal escape brought about the use of lipids with inverted cubic and hexagonal liquid crystalline phases. The progress of lipidic nanocarriers to the current form of LNPs, which are the most sought after lipidic nanocarriers for clinical use nowadays, has been recently thoroughly reviewed by Tenchov et al.

            "text": "Lipid nanocarriers have emerged as versatile and powerful tools in the field of theranostics, offering a unique combination of diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities. Their biocompatibility, ability to encapsulate a wide range of therapeutic and diagnostic agents, and potential for surface modification make them ideal candidates for targeted and personalized medicine. Continued research in the development and synthesis of chemically modified LNPs to achieve tunable biodegradability in vivo would allow the optimization of delivery vehicles, making them more versatile, highly efficient, and biocompatible. Advances in nanoparticle design have significantly improved their stability, targeting efficiency, and controlled-release properties, addressing some of the major challenges in current medical treatments. It is important to note that, among the various types of lipid nanoparticles, liposomes are currently the only lipid-based carriers for theranostics that are undergoing clinical trials. This highlights their established safety profile and efficacy, setting a milestone for other lipid nanoparticles in the theranostic field. \n\nHowever, despite the promising results, several hurdles remain to be overcome before lipid nanoparticles can be widely adopted in clinical practice. These include their potential toxicity, the scalability of their production, regulatory approval, and the need for more comprehensive in vivo studies to fully understand their long-term effects and efficacy. Furthermore, combining diagnostic and therapeutic functionalities into a single nanoparticle system poses additional challenges in terms of design and functionality. \n\nFor these reasons, the use of LNPs in medicine is expected to expand significantly. The development of different types of LNPs with optimized drug delivery properties, such as nanostructured lipid carriers and ionizable cationic nanoparticles, brings additional advantages to LNP formulations and broadens the perspectives of their applications [139]. \n\nFuture research should focus on the development of more sophisticated nanoparticle systems, improving targeting accuracy, and ensuring safe and cost-effective production methods. Interdisciplinary collaboration among chemists, biologists, engineers, and medical professionals will be crucial to advance this technology from the laboratory to the clinic. \n\nIn conclusion, lipid nanoparticles hold great potential for revolutionizing the field of theranostics by pioneering more efficient and individualized treatment approaches.",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have shown remarkable pharmacological and therapeutic properties, raising the interest of researchers for preclinical and clinical studies. Since the materials used for LNPs production include natural sources, they offer several benefits over other materials. These advantages include temporal and thermal stability, ease of preparation, high loading capacity, relatively low production costs, and feasibility for large-scale industrial manufacturing [26]. The main natural sources used for LNPs production include (i) phospholipids and cholesterol, which enhance the stability and circulation capability of NPs within the biological matrix, and (ii) positively charged lipids, which improve the loading capacity of negatively charged molecules. Additionally, LNPs chemical modifications, such as conjugation with gangliosides or polyethylene glycol (PEG), increase solubility and prevent detection by the immune system [27]. LNPs efficiently penetrate cell membranes and deliver their cargo to intracellular target sites due to their similarity to the lipid components of the biological membranes [28]. Once internalized, LNPs release the encapsulated bioactive molecules by exploiting the low pH of the intracellular environment. LNPs can also be linked to antibodies to recognize malignant cells or receptors [26] (Figure 1). \n\nThe LNPs most commonly used in the biomedical field can be categorized into three main groups: liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN), and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) [29]. Liposomes are composed of amphipathic phospholipids organized in bilayer structures. In aqueous solutions, liposomes form vesicles that enhance the stability and solubility of the cargo molecules, whether hydrophilic or hydrophobic. The permeability of hydrophobic drugs across the liposomal membrane can also be improved by adding cholesterol to the formulation. SLNs are composed of mono-, di-, or triglycerides, fatty acids, and glycerides. These physiological elements maintain a solid state in the body, ensuring physical stability over long periods, controlled release of both lipophilic and hydrophilic drugs, and protection of labile molecules.",

            "text": "Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNPs) were first developed in 1991 with the goal of providing biocompatibility, storage stability, and the prevention of drug degradation. 39 SLNPs are nanoscopic colloidal carriers (50-1000 nm) that have been created to address the flaws of conventional colloidal carriers (eg, polymer degradation and cytotoxicity, lack of a suitable large scale production method, inferior stability, drug leakage and fusion, phospholipid degradation, high production cost 39 ). When compared to typical colloidal carriers, SLNs have numerous advantages, including reduced toxicity, a high surface area, delayed drug release, greater cellular absorption, and the capacity to improve drug solubility and bioavailability. 39,40 This is what Pfizer BioNTech used in their most recent creation of a Nano type vaccine. The drug release from SLNs is determined by the matrix type and the drug's placement in the formulation. SLNs made from biodegradable and biocompatible materials can include both hydrophilic and lipophilic bioactive, making them a feasible choice for controlled and targeted drug delivery. 40 The drug is usually disseminated or dissolved in the solid core of SLNs, which is hydrophobic with a monolayer coating of phospholipids (see Scheme 2). 39,40 LNPs are nano-vectors developed to replace liposomes, lipid emulsions, and polymeric nanoparticles as colloidal drug delivery vehicles. SLNPs offer a chance to develop novel therapeutic prototypes for drug delivery and targeting, because of their unique size dependent features and capacity to load medicines. Many academics throughout the world are interested in SLNPs because they have a lot of potential for achieving the objective of targeted and regulated medication delivery.",

            "text": "SLNs present some advantages, such as the capacity to load both hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs, biocompatibility, low susceptibility to erosion, and slow water absorption. Also, the main advantages of SLNs over liposomes rely on the higher stability and loading capacity of hydrophobic drugs [7,10]. Importantly, some of the manufacturing processes used for SLNs production can be applied to large-scale production, with excellent reproducibility being important for downstream commercial and clinical applications [11]. \n\nSLNs are the first generation of this type of lipidic particles that present some limitations, including possible polymorphic transitions, particle growth and gelling, limited cargo (although higher than liposomes), and stability of some drugs since, during storage, lipid crystallization leads to drug expulsion and premature release [10,12]. Also, like other nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems, SLNs also present high manufacturing costs compared to conventional formulations. In order to overcome the limitations of SLNs, a second-generation, nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC) was developed. NLCs differentiate from SLNs by having a blend of solid and liquid (oils) lipids in the composition. This allows a reduction in the melting point of the lipidic core and a higher loading capacity and storage stability of the system [13]. Moreover, in the last years, many lipidic nanoparticles (LNPs), some of them with mixed/hybrid properties, have been proposed, and their categorization is not always consensual. For example, Moderna's and BioNTech/Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccines are referred to as LNPs or SLNs, depending on the source of information [14,15]. This makes difficult the proper identification and classification of the formulations. Despite the similitudes among the SLNs, LNPs, and NLCs, in this review, we will focus on the use of classic SLNs for cancer treatment.",

            "text": "Lipid-based nanoparticles (LNPs) have a number of unique properties and represent one of the most promising nanocarriers for drug delivery and tumor theranostics. LNPs can be classified as liposomes (LSs), solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNPs), and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) and have many advantages, including ease of composition, self-assembly, biocompatibility, high bioavailability, ability to carry a large payload and range physical, and chemical properties that can be controlled to modulate their biological characteristics [71]. LSs are one of the most studied delivery systems due to the biocompatibility and biodegradability that they present. The main components of the LSs are phospholipids, which are organized in bilayer vesicles due to their amphipathic properties. Thus, they are able to encapsulate both hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs [72]. Cholesterol-modified LSs increase the permeability of hydrophobic drugs through a bilayer membrane that improves their stability in the blood [72]. However, major disadvantages of LSs include the lack of available preparation methods, low degree of drug loading capacity and stability, and rapid degradation in the human body until the therapeutic effect can be achieved. SLNPs are colloidal drug delivery systems composed of physiological lipids, which remain solid both at room and body temperatures. The solid lipid forms a matrix material for drug encapsulation and is a stabilized mixture of surfactants or polymers. They have low toxicity, physical stability over a long period and control of release of drugs, site-specific targeting, easy large-scale production, and simple sterilization [73]. NLCs are nanocarriers developed from SLNPs, which represent a combination of solid and liquid lipids. The advantage of these systems is the higher ability to encapsulate a wide range of drugs soluble in liquid and solid lipid phases [74]. \n\nThere are two main ways to deliver nanocarriers. One of them is passive targeting, which occurs when liposomes penetrate into tumor cells only due to molecular movement through the cell membrane (Figure 2).",

            "text": "Lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles are a class of scalable and biodegradable nanocarriers that show significant potential for mRNA delivery [205]. Attractive for immunotherapy due to their structural versatility, inorganic nanoparticles with lipid shells have been investigated to effectively encapsulate drugs [206]. LPN is a mature technology platform for safe and effective delivery of RNA drugs. Compared with other nucleic acid drug delivery systems, LPN has great advantages, such as high nucleic acid encapsulation rate and effective cell transfection, high tissue penetration, low cytotoxicity and immunogenicity. For example, researchers have used materials such as ionizable lipid libraries, phospholipids, cholesterol, and lipid-anchored PEG to create a lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticle that can effectively deliver mRNA to mouse fetuses [207,208]. After encapsulation of mRNA by lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles and intravenous injection into the fetus, it was demonstrated that lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles enabled functional delivery of mRNA to the liver, lungs, and intestine. Notably, lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles were also used to deliver erythropoietin (EPO) mRNA to demonstrate its therapeutic potential. Delivery of EPO mRNA to mouse fetal hepatocytes increased the EPO protein content in the fetus and greatly enhanced the therapeutic effect (Figure 7) [207]. \n\nLipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles retain the properties of lipid nanoparticles while providing more structural options that offer advantages in immunotherapy. Therefore, LNPs are a key technology for mRNA vaccines to effectively protect mRNA and transport it into cells to play an important role, but their complex structures and manufacturing processes can hinder the clinical application of these heterogeneous nanoparticles [209], and further research is needed to overcome these hindrances to achieve better therapeutic results. Lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles retain the properties of lipid nanoparticles while providing more structural options that offer advantages in immunotherapy.",

            "text": "Lipid-based formulations are known for better uptake efficiency at cellular level. Physiological aspects of lipid-cell interaction are vital to understand the therapeutic distribution and ultimate fate of carrier system (Xing et al., 2016). LNPs exhibit many advantages as delivery carriers over other nanocarrier systems (such as polymers, CNTs, metallic NPs etc.), and have seen extensive usage in drug delivery. In addition to the above mentioned concerns of CNTs and metallic NPs, it has been observed that metallo-supramolecular polymers, that can provide the functionality of the metal ion along with the processability of a polymer have some limitations when used in drug delivery processes. For example, the introduction of metal ions in the body can disturb the ion balance and limit certain medical applications (Rowan and Beck, 2005), (Dong et al., 2015). Furthermore, dendritic polymers exhibit many drawbacks which limit their usage in theranostic applications, for instance, several complex and highly expensive synthetic and purification procedures can lead to imprecise or nonspecific structures with low quantifiability. Moreover, these polymers show poor reproducibility and certain biosafety concerns due to their possible toxicity and unexpected removal, which restrict their clinical translation (Jain et al., 2010), (Shcharbin et al., 2014). The development of LNPs paves the way for resolving above stated limitations. \n\nAdvantages of LNPs may include: (1) ease of engineering processes, (2) up-scaling feasibility, (3) excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability, (4) negligible toxicity, (5) controlled and targeted drug release potential, (6) improved drug solubility and stability, (7) enhanced bioavailability, (8) potential of encapsulating both lipophilic and hydrophilic drugs, (9) less expensive, (10) encapsulation of high drug content, (11) potential to cross various physiological barriers, (12) easy validation, and many others which could be favorable for specific delivery route or nature of the payload (Ghasemiyeh and Mohammadi-Samani, 2018), (Attama et al., 2012).",

However, the difficulties associated with mass production and the stability of LNPs limit the clinical and commercial applications of LNP technologies. To address this issue, researchers present a simple and industrially accessible method for producing bilayer vesicles. An ethanolic solution dissolving phytantriol, Pluronic F127, and vitamin E acetate was mixed with deionized water. When ethanol was evaporated from the aqueous mixture, vesicles were transformed into liquid NPs with well-de\ue103ned internal structures such as hexagonal lattices, lined or coiled patterns, and disordered structures, depending on the composition. The production only needs mixing and ethanol evaporation and it is possible to produce about 10 kg per batch of reaction, enabling the large-scale production of lipid NPs for various biomedical applications. 377 Another study aimed at developing a large-scale modular production line, which involved a continuous and scalable emulsi\ue103cation and homogenization process to produce nanostructured lipid NPs. The production line exhibited good control over the emulsi\ue103cation and homogenization process and enabled the particle size below 210 nm at a throughput of 25 kg h \u22121 , demonstrating the robustness of this device. 378 To realize a continuous and scalable nanoprecipitation synthesis of solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN), researchers developed a platform to mix an acetonic lipid solution with water using static mixers, which exhibited good control over the nanoprecipitation process and enabled the production of SLN below 200 nm at a throughput of 37.5-150 g h \u22121 . This work demonstrates the potential of using the static mixing-nanoprecipitation technique for continuous and large-scale production of SLN. 379 ecently, micro\ue104uidics has developed as a novel process for simply manufacturing LNPs. In micro\ue104uidics, introducing only the aqueous phase and lipids into the organic solvent phase can generate LNPs with the conditioning of \ue104ow rate, the ratio between the two phases of liquids, the concentration of lipids and drugs, as well as the mixing modes.",

            "text": "This structure grants LNPs excellent drug loading capacity and stability (Zong et al., 2023). Compared to liposomes, LNPs provide higher drug loading capacity and better physical stability due to their solid or semi-solid lipid cores, which allow drugs to be more effectively embedded, enhancing drug stability and loading efficiency (Estap\u00e9 Senti et al., 2024). Additionally, the surface of LNPs can be modified with polyethylene glycol (PEG) or other hydrophobic molecules to extend their circulation time in the blood and reduce the likelihood of clearance by the mononuclear phagocyte system (Huang et al., 2023). LNPs also offer significant advantages in targeted delivery and localized release. By modifying the surface with targeting ligands, LNPs can specifically target tumor cells or particular molecules within the tumor microenvironment, enabling precise drug delivery. In the context of mRNA vaccine delivery, LNPs protect mRNA from degradation by nucleases within the body and facilitate its effective entry into target cells (Cheng et al., 2020;Kon et al., 2023). The successful application of LNPs in CRISPR-Cas9 has further validated their potential in nucleic acid drug delivery, laying a foundation for their use in cancer immunotherapy (Rosenblum et al., 2020). \n\nPolymeric Nanoparticles (PNPs) are nanoscale particles made from natural or synthetic polymers, including structures such as solid nanoparticles, nanomicelles, or nanocapsules. Their greatest advantage lies in their highly tunable physicochemical properties. By selecting different polymer materials and synthesis methods, the particle size, shape, surface charge, and degradation rate of PNPs can be precisely controlled (Li et al., 2018;Rajana et al., 2022). For example, by incorporating stimulus-responsive polymers (e.g., pH, temperature, or redox-sensitive polymers), PNPs can trigger drug release in specific pathological environments, thereby enhancing treatment specificity and efficacy (Kim et al., 2024).",

            "text": "Drug delivery system (DDS) is a progressive pharmaceutical formulation that delivers drugs to specific sites and release in a desired manner and rate. A few decades ago, small molecule drugs were the predominant therapeutic agents and their delivery depended heavily on the physicochemical properties of their own structure. In contrast, with the development of pharmaceutical sciences, the content of drugs has been extended to nucleic acids [1], peptides [2], proteins [3], and even cells [4], which are difficult to apply directly in clinical therapy due to the instability of their physicochemical properties. In this context, the role of DDS is increasingly significant, not only limited to improving the solubility of small molecule drugs but also in controlling the release behavior [5], maintaining the activity of drugs [6], overcoming biological barriers [7], and improving pharmacokinetics [8]. Lipid nanoparticle (LNP) is currently the most widely used and mature DDS in clinical practice. Whether it is more than twenty small molecule DDS formulations that have been marketed or the recent mRNA vaccines for COVID-19, LNP plays a key role in the development of advanced pharmaceuticals [9]. The concept of LNP can be divided into general LNP and special LNP. General LNP is a new DDS that use biocompatible phospholipid materials as carriers to wrap bioactive substances in nuclei or attach them to the surface of nanoparticles. General LNP includes solid lipid nanoparticles, niosomes, transfersomes, nanostructured lipid carriers, micelles, etc., of which liposome is the most representative [10]. And special LNP is described in more articles now as a specific type of particle used to deliver nucleic acids with the development of COVID-19 vaccines [10,11]. Special LNP is a composite vesicular structure composed of four components: PEGylated lipids, ionizable lipids, structural phospholipids, and cholesterol. Here, we refer to LNPs, collectively, as lipid-based nanoparticles to avoid confusion.",

While all three types of LNP include lipids in their formulation, they can be differentiated by their core structure as described in Figure 2. Lipid nanoparticles used in drug delivery systems have an average size in the nanometer range. The majority of the ingredients entering the LNP composition are FDA and EMA approved, with the lipid composition remaining similar to lipophilic physiological molecules, while being adapted to fit the active molecule encapsulated. They are non-toxic and biodegradable. \n\nLNP are used as drug delivery systems, protecting and stabilizing hydrophobic active molecules in aqueous solutions. Their primary advantage is the improvement of the bioavailability of drugs, specifically lipophilic molecules that can be better solubilized in the lipid core than in aqueous environments. The lipophilic core of lipid nanoparticles entraps active ingredients, while the surfactant membrane, generally consisting solely or partially of phospholipids, ensures the stability of LNP in hydrophilic environment. LNP are particularly well suited for transdermal drug delivery. Indeed, lipid nanoparticles are known to create a mono-layer film on the skin, limiting water evaporation and improving skin hydration [16].",

            "text": "As a result of their small size and unique properties, the use of nanoparticles as drug carriers has been the focus of interest of researchers worldwide, specially to improve treatments of different unmet medical needs [109]. These systems are able to protect and target drugs to specific sites, allowing for a reduction in peripheral toxicity and an increase in therapeutic benefits [110,111]. So far, different nanoparticulate carriers have been used for these purposes, such as lipid nanoparticles, polymeric nanoparticles, and inorganic nanoparticles, among others [112]. Recent studies have shown particular interest in lipid nanoparticles, as they show advantages over other types of nanoparticles, including biodegradability, biocompatibility, low toxicity, scale-up capacity, and prolonged drug delivery [111]. In general, lipid nanoparticles include liposomes and solid lipid matrix nanoparticles, specifically solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC), though different nomination for lipid-based nanoparticles can be found elsewhere [109]. Nonetheless, although liposomes have been developed earlier and there are already some products approved for clinical use, liposome-based formulations show stability problems and the raw materials are expensive [113,114]. Therefore, SLN and NLC arise as a promising alternative, as they can overcome these limitations and have proven to be effective drug delivery systems. Their success can be demonstrated by the exponential increase in scientific publications on these systems [109,110]. In particular, publications from 2015 to date have increased from 682 to 1113 in PubMed (61.3%) and from 1141 to 2773 in Scopus (41.1%), which are remarkable numbers if we consider that the total period of publications on SLN is around 30 years, and on NLC around 20 years. SLN were the first generation of solid lipid-based carrier systems with sizes in the nanometer range and ability to encapsulate lipophilic drugs [115].",

            "text": "Rapid advances in lipid-based nanoparticles show an immense impact on cancer treatment and management. Looking into the structural makeup of LNPs, we found that LNPs are composed of lipids that are both biodegradable and biocompatible such as phospholipids, cholesterol, and triglycerides. The inclusion of such less toxic substances, as well as limited use of organic solvents, makes LNPs a safe drug delivery system against TNBC as compared to polymeric and inorganic NPs [4,8]. According to the general prototype, LNPs consist of API, lipids that are designed to sequester, deliver, and promote functionality. Further, to maintain the stability of the dispersions formed by the LNPs, in environmental stresses, surfactants or a combination of surfactants are used, depending on their HLB values [25]. Further, to safeguard the LNPs from the reticuloendothelial system (RES) and to render biological stability, LNPs are often coated with a stealth or biocompatible polymeric layer such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) [6,26,27]. Finally, for possessing an enhanced targeting property, the LNPs may bind with a targeting moiety such as a biological receptor-specific ligand. Such orientation of LNPs and their small size help the LNPs to accumulate frequently on the tumor sites [6]. \n\nIn cancer research, it was observed that approximately 40% of new chemical entities show poor aqueous solubility, which further limits their therapeutic efficiency. Thus, the utilization of hydrophobic LNPs as a vehicle either encapsulates or solubilizes the drug moiety that will further improve the stability of poorly aqueous soluble drugs in the surrounding aqueous media and will prevent the precipitation of the drugs both in vitro and in vivo. Hence, it could be inferred that the development of LNPs shows improved chemotherapeutic efficacy by increasing their solubility [28,29].",

            "text": "Therefore, lipid-based nanoparticles are less toxic and more biocompatible than inorganic or polymeric nanoparticles [31]. Different nanoparticles can be obtained composed of biocompatible and biodegradable lipids: liposomes, nanostructured lipid carriers or solid lipid nanoparticles, for instance. Liposomes have been the most applied lipid-based drug delivery systems, and they have also been approved for clinical treatments [32]. Nonetheless, they present a low capacity to encapsulate hydrophobic molecules, low storage stability and eventual drug leakage in the media [31,32]. \n\nSolid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) offer an interesting alternative to liposomes as promising robust nanocarriers for controlled drug delivery. They present a hydrophobic internal core composed of solid lipids at room or body temperature and an external stabilizing layer formed by amphiphilic surfactants and sometimes co-surfactants (Figure 2). They present many advantages, such as low toxicity, high stability, high biocompatibility and biodegradability, and the remarkable capacity to incorporate both hydrophilic and lipophilic compounds. In addition, they enable a controlled release of the incorporated drug, and they provide chemical protection to the compound. They can be produced by simple and economical large-scale production, and it has been demonstrated that they can be effectively administrated through a wide variety of routes (oral, parenteral, rectal, nasal, ocular, etc.) [31]. The components, production methods and characterization protocols for the SLNs development are beyond the scope of this review and are already reviewed elsewhere [31,[33][34][35]. \n\nAnother advantage of SLNs is that their surface can be easily modified to modulate some relevant biological interactions. For instance, signaling molecules can be added to obtain targeted drug delivery, or surface characteristics can be altered by adding polymers (such as polyethylene glycol, PEG) to obtain a steal drug delivery system inside the organism [31,36].",

            "text": "Nanoparticles are rapidly developing as drug carriers. Lipid nanoparticles are widely employed in drug delivery. Many different types of lipid nanoparticles have been engineered, such as lipid nanocapsules, lipid drug conjugates, SLNs, and NLCs. NLCs involve the modification of SLNs. The structural arrangement of solid and liquid lipids of NLCs is not fixed in design. Thus, the structure is flexible, and high encapsulation efficiency and drug loading can be attained, and leakage impeded while retaining the features of SLNs. NLCs, as a new generation of lipid nanoparticles, offer many advantages and a wide range of applications, such as in drug delivery, with broad prospects for further development. NLCs are the most important type of drug delivery and are prepared mainly using HPH, which is a well-established technique; however, the disadvantages related to this production method (high operating temperatures and cavitation forces), as well as the need for encapsulating many types of drugs with different physico-chemical features and various stability and solubility problems, led to the development of new types of lipid nanoparticles and innovative preparation methods. At present, research on NLCs is limited to preclinical studies, with clinical applications remaining far from realization. There are some limitations, such as the presence of organic solvent residue, uneven distribution, complex production process, poor stability, and so on. \n\nTherefore, PNPs entered the field as a better drug carrier. Compared to NLCs, PNPs not only can effectively transport the drug to a specific target site, such as the organs or tissues affected by the disease, but also increase the efficacy of drugs in diseased tissue. Meanwhile, PNPs can reduce the side effects on the surrounding normal tissue and organs, enhance the stability of the drug, and make the release more gradual and better controlled. Many have benefitted from the ability to control or adjust the drug release, which is achieved through the modification of nanoparticle surfaces, development of new carrier materials, and the study of targeted drugs.",

            "text": "The underlying concept of LNPs as a well-tolerated carrier system is well established and documented. It was observed that the lipids employed in the preparation of LNPs such as liposomes, nanoemulsion, SLNs, NLCs, and LPH-NPs are non-toxic, biocompatible, and biodegradable with poor or no immunogenicity. The lipids have the capacity of forming nanostructure and have been investigated extensively as a nanocarrier for cancer-targeted drug delivery system. It was further concluded that the physicochemical properties of lipids provide the opportunity to optimize the drug delivery system by customizing their geometrical parameters which include particle size, morphology, entrapment efficiency, drug loading, and in vitro drug release profile. Further, the LNPs show passive targeting as well as active targeting if surface-functionalized, which enhances the therapeutic efficacy as well as targeting the cancer site. However, there exists certain reluctance regarding the efficacy and safety of LNPs which are overturned by the advent of reliable GRAS-regulated lipids, cGMP-grade manufacturing processes, and preclinical data related to their ADME status and toxicity, followed by fruitful first-in-man studies. It was further expected that the LNPs might be the first nanoparticle forming an impact on the management and treatment of cancer. Likewise, Doxil nanoparticles were observed as the first of a wave of novel LNPmediated drug delivery systems that could deliver a transformative impact on anticancer therapeutics in the years to come.",

            "text": "mRNA delivery vehicles primarily include LNPs, polymeric nanoparticle delivery systems, inorganic nanoparticle delivery systems, and peptide nanoparticle delivery systems. Among them, LNPs are the most widely used in mRNA vaccines; they are also common non-viral delivery vehicles in gene therapy [75]. mRNAs can be protected by LNPs from ribonuclease degradation and enter cells by endocytosis then escape into the cytoplasm via endosomes to complete mRNA translation and expression [76]. The immunogenicity of mRNA vaccines is also increased after LNP encapsulation and delivery [77]. \n\nLNPs in mRNA vaccines are composed of four main components: phospholipids, cholesterol, PEG lipids, and ionizable lipids. Because phospholipids can spontaneously organize into lipid bilayers and have high phase transition temperatures, they are often used as structural lipids and account for approximately 10-20% of the total lipids in LNPs. Kauffman et al. [78] found that phospholipid 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) improved mRNA transfection efficiency. Zhang et al. [79] found that DOPE can affect the biodistribution of LNPs in vivo. Cholesterol is another structural lipid in LNPs, accounting for approximately 20-50% of the total lipids in LNPs. Cholesterol enhances particle stability by modulating membrane integrity and rigidity [80,81]. The molecular geometry of cholesterol derivatives can further affect the delivery efficiency and biodistribution of LNPs [82]. PEG lipids serve to control the size of LNPs and stabilize them, preventing aggregation of the particles during storage [83,84]. PEG lipids can also prevent rapid uptake of LNPs, reducing serum protein-mediated opsonization and clearance by reticuloendothelial cells and improving the circulation half-life of LNPs [85].",

Recently, they have gained significant interest, mainly due to the widespread use of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, which would not have been possible without LNP-based mRNA delivery. While many challenges remain in the development of safe and effective LNP-based drug delivery systems, further studies are needed to deepen our understanding of biological and chemical factors prior to broad clinical application. However, researchers assume that targeted delivery systems, such as LNPs, are likely to increase the efficacy and reduce side effects of existing therapies, e.g., immunotherapy, mRNA-based cancer vaccines or CAR therapy [22,26]. \n\nFrom our perspective, major challenges regarding the clinical implementation of LNPs in lung cancer treatment are (1) identifying the target and determining druggability, (2) predicting the quality and stability of LNPs, and (3) enabling specific tissue targeting and tumor penetration. \n\nOverall, however, we believe that LNPs have the potential to become an essential drug delivery system, overcome limitations of traditional therapeutic reagents and open new avenues for translational nanomedicine in lung cancer treatment.",

            "text": "Therefore, an efficient alternative formulation for better delivery of RDV with minimum side effects is required. \n\nNanosized drug-carrier systems have been developed in the past decades and are divided into polymeric and lipid nanoparticles 10 . Polymeric nanoparticles are solid colloidal particles made of non-biodegradable synthetic polymers or biodegradable macromolecular materials from synthetic, semisynthetic, or natural resources. They have some disadvantages, such as the cytotoxicity of polymers and the lack of suitable large-scale production techniques. In contrast, lipid nanoparticles have less toxicological risk due to the natural and biological origins of their materials. Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) are the most common lipid nanomaterials. The advantages of SLNs are the use of biodegradable physiological lipids, the avoidance of organic solvents related to the production method, the possibility of large-scale production, improving the drug bioavailability, the protecting of sensitive drugs from rigorous environments, and controlling drug release 11 . Nevertheless, SLNs show disadvantages such as unpredictable gelation tendency, unexpected dynamics of polymorphic transitions, particle growing, high water content of SLN dispersions, adjustment of drug release profile, limited drug loading (DL) capacity due to the crystalline structure of solid lipids, and drug expulsion during storage due to the formation of a perfect crystal 12 . \n\nNLCs are the second generation of SLNs, which were developed to resolve some problems raised by SLNs. In contrast to SLN being produced from solid lipids, NLCs are produced by controlled mixing of solid lipids with liquid lipids, leading to unique nanostructures in the matrix. Since liquid lipids solubilize lipophilic molecules more than solid lipids, the NLC particles can provide a higher loading capacity and better release control. When SLNs are prepared from solid lipids, their matrix forms a perfect crystal lattice with limited space to accommodate the active ingredients. In contrast, the employment of solid and liquid lipids in NLCs can distort the production of a perfect crystal.",

Due to their size-dependent properties, lipid nanoparticles offer the possibility to develop new therapeutics that could be used for secondary and tertiary level of drug targeting. Hence, lipid nanoparticles hold great promise for reaching the goal of controlled and site specific drug delivery and has attracted wide attention of researchers.\n\nAt the turn of the millennium, modifications of SLN, nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) and lipid drug conjugate (LDC)-nanoparticles were introduced [2,3] in addition to liquid crystal DDS. These carrier systems overcome observed limitations of conventional SLN and more fluid lipid DDS. Compared to liposomes and emulsions, solid particles possess some advantages, e.g. protection of incorporated active compounds against chemical degradation and more flexibility in modulating the release of the compound. This paper focuses on the different lipid based nano systems, their structure and associated features, stability, production methods, drug incorporation and other issues related to their formulation and use in drug delivery. The following advantages among others, could be ascribed to lipid based nanocarriers:\n\n\u2022 ability to control and target drug release. \u2022 ability to improve stability of pharmaceuticals. \u2022 ability to encapsulate high drug content (compared to other carrier systems e.g. polymeric nanoparticles). \u2022 the feasibility of carrying both lipophilic and hydrophilic drugs. \u2022 most of the lipids used are biodegradable, and as such they have excellent biocompatibility, are non-toxic, non-allergenic and non-irritating. \u2022 they can be formulated by water-based technologies and thus can avoid organic solvents. \u2022 they are easy to scale-up and sterilize. \u2022 they are less expensive than polymeric/surfactant based carriers. \u2022 they are easy to validate.",

Their main components are lipids and fatty acids, which are widely found in biological membranes. They have excellent biocompatibility, allowing both hydrophilic drugs to be loaded in the core and lipid-soluble drugs to be loaded between the lipid bilayers (Jagaran & Singh, 2022;Large et al., 2021). The design of PTX-loaded Rg3-LPs on C6 glioma cells was shown not only improved the permeability to the BBB but also enhanced the targeting and diffusion ability of glioma in vivo (Fanciullino, Ciccolini & Milano, 2021;Zhu et al., 2021). SLNs and NLCs are new types of nano-drug-loading system developed over the past decade, which have the advantages of good biocompatibility, controlled drug release and ease of large-scale industrial production as some researches have shown (Chang et al., 2021;Paliwal et al., 2020).",

SLNs have attracted increasing attention in recent years for delivering drugs, nucleic acids, proteins, peptides, nutraceuticals, and cosmetics. These nanocarriers have attracted industrial attention due to their ease of preparation, physicochemical stability, and scalability. These characteristics make SLNs attractive for manufacture on a large scale. Currently, several products with SLNs are in clinical trials, and there is a high possibility that SLN carriers will quickly increase their presence in the market. A large-scale manufacturing unit is required for commercial applications to prepare enough formulations for clinical studies. Furthermore, continuous processing is becoming more popular in the pharmaceutical sector to reduce product batch-to-batch differences. This review paper discusses some conventional methods and the rationale for large-scale production. It further covers recent progress in scale-up methods for the synthesis of SLNs, including high-pressure homogenization (HPH), hot melt extrusion coupled with HPH, microchannels, nanoprecipitation using static mixers, and microemulsion-based methods. These scale-up technologies enable the possibility of commercialization of SLNs. Furthermore, ongoing studies indicate that these technologies will eventually reach the pharmaceutical market.",

With the accumulating library of lipid materials with various functions and characteristics, LNPs holds great potential for versatile delivery of a universal selection of therapeutic agents, with greatly shortened time for formulation screening and optimization.

            "text": "Use of nanoparticle has shown great potential as novel drug delivery systems. The ability to deliver drugs more effectively and efficiently to the site of interest translates into less harmful systemic side effects and more beneficial therapeutic action [1]. Nanoparticulate delivery systems such as liposomes and polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) have been extensively developed for delivering a variety of bioactive molecules such as drugs, genes, proteins, and targeting ligands [2,3]. Among these delivery systems, liposomes are spherical lipid vesicles with a bilayer structure of natural or synthetic amphiphilic lipid molecules. Liposomes have been widely used as drug delivery vesicles because of their biocompatible, biodegradable, nontoxic, flexible, and non-immunogenic properties for systemic and local administration. Furthermore, the lipid materials are able to fuse with the cell membrane and enhance the cell internalization of liposomes. However, liposomes have several limitations from the viewpoint of physical and chemical stability, batch-to-batch reproducibility, sterilization and manufacturing scale-up [4,5]. On the other hand, polymeric nanoparticles possess high structural integrity afforded by the rigidity of the polymer matrix, and are thus inherently more stable than liposomes [6,7]. The limitations of polymeric NPs include use of toxic organic solvents in the production process, poor drug encapsulation for hydrophilic drugs, polymer cytotoxicity and polymer degradation [8]. \n\nThe lipid-polymer hybrid NPs (LPNs) combining the positive attributes of both liposomes and polymeric NPs are increasingly being considered as promising candidates to carry therapeutic agents safely and efficiently [9,10]. LPNs are polymeric nanoparticles enveloped by lipid layers [11]. The inclusion of lipid coat enables the hybrid nanoparticles to encapsulate not only water-insoluble drugs, but also water-soluble drugs with greater encapsulation efficiency. LPNs exhibit high structural integrity, stability during storage, and controlled release capability attributed to the polymer core, and high biocompatibility and bioavailability owed to the lipid layer [12,13].",

            "text": "Recently, nanotechnology has been successfully employed in the pharmaceutical industry for improving drug solubility, bioavailability, and stability during processing and storage [7].Nanopreparations based on lipids (LNPs), which are naturally abundant and part of the human diet, have been found to be superior to polymeric nanoparticles in preserving and enhancing the biological activity of the encapsulated payloads [8].Low production cost, ease of scale-up, better stability profile, and ease of modifications make LNPs a more preferable option among colloidal carriers [9].LNPs are feasible and effective for administration via different routes, including oral, parenteral, and topical [10].\n\nSolid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), a primary type of LNPs, are made up of solid lipids with a crystalline nature, which encapsulate the active substance within a solid lipid matrix, allowing for controlled drug release [11].SLNs can easily penetrate through biological membranes and facilitate the penetration of loaded drugs, hence improving their concentration in target tissues [12].Nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs), introduced as the next generation LNPs, are composed of solid and liquid lipids.They aim to overcome the shortcomings of SLNs, for instance, increased drug loading capacity and improved stability by preventing drug leakage from the nanoparticles during storage [13].\n\nLiposomes, nanosized lipid bilayer vesicular systems composed of natural phospholipids and cholesterol, can incorporate higher loads of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs, protect the loaded substances, and efficiently cross biological membranes [14,15].Moreover, liposomes can be easily modified for targeted delivery with controlled release and have minimal intrinsic toxicity due to the natural phospholipids.Structurally, liposomes may have one or multiple bilayer membranes.On the basis of number of bilayers, liposomes are classified as multilamellar vesicles (MLV) and unilamellar vesicles (ULV).",

On the basis of this, we delve deep into manufacturing challenges, scalability issues, and regulatory hurdles, associated with the clinical translation of LNP technology. Within the framework focusing on the programmability in each domain, we prioritized patient-centric factors like dosing regimens, administration techniques, and potential consequences. Notably, this review expands to innovative anatomical routes, such as intranasal and intraocular administration, offering a thorough examination of the advantages and disadvantages of each route. We also offered a comprehensive comparison between artificial LNPs and natural exosomes in terms of functionality, biocompatibility, and therapeutic potential. Ultimately, this review highlights the potential of programmable LNPs to evolve into more intelligent, naturally integrated systems, achieving optimal biocompatibility and functionality.",

            "text": "The materials used to develop nanoparticles as antigen delivery systems/vaccines against arboviruses are diverse. In general, organic polymers were preferentially used to develop nanovaccines against arboviruses compared to inorganic polymers (Figure 2A). Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are one of the most used in experimental vaccines against arboviruses. LNPs have been used as a delivery system. This could be attributed to some advantages of these nanoparticles, such as high mono dispersion, long time stability, and relatively good thermal stability [44]. LNPs generally consist of four components, (1) an ionizable cationic lipid, which promotes self-assembly in particles about 100 nm in size and allows the release of the antigen; (2) a lipid-bound polyethylene glycol (PEG), which increases the half-life of formulations; (3) cholesterol, a stabilizing agent; and (4) naturally occurring phospholipids, which support the lipid bilayer structure [45]. LNPs also promote improved protein stability, prevent proteolytic degradation, and have low toxicity since LNPs production do not need to use potentially toxic organic solvents, which can also have a harmful effect on antigens [46]. Currently, LNPs are one of the most used vectors for RNA delivery in vivo, especially for the treatment of genetic conditions, but some works explore them as vaccines [45,47,48]. \n\nAmong inorganic nanoparticles, it is not surprising that gold nanoparticles (Au-NPs) are the most used in the production of vaccines against arboviruses (Figure 2A). As they were widely disseminated throughout nanotechnology, they are used in almost all medical applications (diagnostics, therapy, prevention). They are usually the most used material in inorganic nanoparticles for vaccine purposes [25,49]. Au-NPs could increase antigen stability by protecting them from premature degradation by proteolytic enzymes [50].",

            "text": "These lipidic, polymeric and inorganic nanocarriers all have distinct advantages and disadvantages in drug delivery applications 168,169 . Lipidic nanoparticles are easy to formulate, and many different lipids are available with well-defined composition and properties, which can be screened to identify the ideal lipid mixture for optimal delivery performance 229 . The efficacy of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine is partly related to such an optimized lipid formulation 230 . However, encapsulating small hydrophilic drugs and functionalization of lipid nanoparticles remain challenging, but could be addressed through modification of lipids. Polymeric nanoparticles show high compositional and structural diversity, in terms of molecular weight and architecture, enabling the encapsulation of almost any drug. In addition, biodegradability, stimulus responsiveness and targeting can be incorporated into polymeric nanoparticles. However, batch-to-batch variations in composition and molecular weight of the polymeric carrier may be problematic for clinical translation. For example, a wide molecular weight distribution leads to polydispersity in nanoparticle size and surface potential, which, in turn, promotes aggregation and affects performance. Inorganic nanoparticles are usually more uniform in size, composition and structure, and can possess electrical, magnetic or optical properties for external control release or imaging. Inorganic nanoparticles with a porous structure, such as mesoporous silica nanoparticles, allow loading of drug molecules into the internal pores with high efficiency 231,232 . If drug loading is confined to surface immobilization, however, the loading level is lower, and surface-exposed drugs are more prone to degradation.\n\nSeveral strategies can be applied to improve the delivery performance of nanocarriers 168,169 . For example, more specific inflammation targeting can be achieved by designing carriers that respond to inflammatory molecules. Furthermore, the delivery of multiple cargoes with one vehicle (all-in-one drug delivery platform) at different stages of inflammation would be valuable to treat inflammation. For example, by adapting to the characteristics of the inflammatory microenvironment at different stages, the delivery system could initially release scavengers to remove cfDNA or mitigate RONS, followed by the release of drugs that can block leukocyte-endoth",

            "text": "Translating nanosystems into clinics has a barrier in determining appropriate manufacturing strategies that ensure quality and yield. 170,171 CDNs have issues with scalability and reproducibility because they are natural lipids derived from cells. 172 On the other hand, LNPs are synthetic lipid nanoparticles, and therefore they have advantages in large-scale production. COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are made using LNPs as a delivery system, meaning that clinical translation of LNPs has been successful. 173 Using micro-\ue104uidic chips, large-scale production of both CDNs and LNPs are plausible. 110,174 Therefore, one of the future challenges will be the large-scale production of CDNs, concerning the mass production of mammalian cells to prepare for CDNs. \n\nTrafficking in vitro and in vivo of nanosystems are critical future challenges. Most of the research on trafficking nanosystems employs \ue104uorescent tags, either using lipid dyes or \ue104uorescently labeled proteins. Even though these techniques demonstrated data on nanosystem absorption, the intracellular trafficking and processing of these molecules are not representative of nucleic acids. 175 It is a \ue103eld of research that has not been developed so far due to technical problems. Intracellular trafficking and determining endosomal pathways in vitro, needs high-resolution confocal laser scanning microscopy as well as \ue104uorescent dyelabeled genes. 215 Another important challenge is to \ue103nd out what types of targeted cells exist a\ue09der systemic delivery. Fluorescently labeled gene or \ue104uorescent protein-expressing gene transfection was required, followed by \ue104ow cytometry analysis. However, this method has a limitation in analyzing one delivery system at a time. 85 DNA barcoding can solve this problem and works efficiently. DNA barcoding can identify differences in species in their DNA. 177 It is difficult to classify more than ten \ue104uorescence types; on the other hand, there are 10 million species. Therefore, DNA barcoding enables, in a single experiment, the analysis of targeted cells by hundreds of nanoparticles. 63,64,74 anosystems can target different cells without speci\ue103c ligands, and the mechanism is not fully identi\ue103ed, as described above.",

            "text": "The authors obtained a good separation profile for liposomes and three main acceptor domains (albumin, HDL, and LDL) [58]. This study confirmed that rigid liposomes and PEGylated fluid liposomes showed higher stability in human plasma when compared to non-PEGylated fluid liposomes. This means that the bilayer composition of a liposomal formulation plays a significant role in stability and drug release in biological media. Hence, separation of the plasma-liposome sample by AF4 seems to be a potential alternative to already established methods. \n\nLipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are typically spherical nanoparticles with a solid lipid core that act as a novel pharmaceutical drug delivery system [84,85]. LNPs were first approved as a drug delivery vehicle in 2018 for the drug Onpattro to treat polyneuropathy in patients with hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis [86]. It became more widely known in late 2020 because some COVID-19 vaccines, notably mRNA-1273 [87] and BNT162b [88], used PEGylated-lipid nanoparticles for mRNA delivery [89]. Similar to liposomal drug formulations, determination of payload content relative to LNP size can be important to understand the efficacy and safety. AF4 has been successfully used for the separation and characterization of lipid-based drug delivery systems; however, electrostatically interacting LNP complexes with the relatively labile lipid-monolayer coating are more prone to destabilization during the focusing step in the conventional AF4 channel [90]. \n\nNon-focusing AF4 channels (frit-inlet or dispersion channel) can circumvent the instability of the LNPs during conventional AF4 separation. In a recent study, Mildner et al., demonstrated AF4 with the frit-inlet channel was well-suited for the analysis of lipid-based nanoparticles for RNA delivery with satisfactory reproducibility and sample recovery [39].",

            "text": "Avian anti-TNF-\u03b1 antibody  The synthesis of IFX@PPNP was feasible. Oral administration of IFX@PPNP resulted in a high drug concentration locally in the inflamed intestines and low systemic exposure. Treatment with IFX@PPNP was highly effective in terms of clinical, histomorphological parameters, as well it led to a decrease in pro-inflammatory parameters in colonic tissue and serum LPNs are obtained from biodegradable lipid materials of physiological nature and of high melting point. The high melting point (usually above room and body temperature) ensures that the lipid core of nanoparticles is solid, promoting the sustained release of the loaded drug [43]. The lipid character of these drug delivery systems is particularly suited for oral administration as they will undergo the same metabolic pathways as the lipids from food [17,44]. Lipids work as absorption enhancers, thereby improving the bioavailability of the loaded drugs. This is particularly interesting for drugs belonging to classes II and IV of the Biopharmaceutical Classification System (BCS) [22]. The advantages of using LNPs as promising carriers for the oral administration of mAbs are attributed to their biodegradability, low cytotoxicity, high drug loading capacity, and scalability. Their production is cost-effective, and the particles provide a drug release in a controlled manner for up to several weeks [45]. Both types of LNPs, namely solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC), are currently considered to be the newest and the most effective carriers of active substances [23,46,47]. Their main advantage is to increase the bioavailability of the incorporated drug administered by different routes [48,49]. They can modify drug release [50] for site-specific targeting of the drug to improve its bioavailability [51,52]. LNPs are composed of biodegradable and biocompatible lipids [53,54], solid at room and body temperatures. They have also been successfully proposed to encapsulate proteins and small peptides [45,46,[55][56][57][58][59].",

Of many currently available nanoparticles for drug delivery, including, bubbles, 6,7 fiber meshes, 8,9 and patches, 10 lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have shown several irreplaceable advantages over these counterparts. LNPs are lipid-based nanocarriers (monostearin, phospholipids, sphingolipids, etc.), and compared with other carriers, the lipid material has advantages of simple molecular structures, good biocompatibility, and capability of large-scale production. 11 LNPs are preferable drug delivery systems for improving the bioavailability of many lipophilic drugs due to their superior transmembrane delivery and preferable cellular internalization capabilities. 12,13 e prodrugs are generally recognized as chemically modified and biologically inert drug molecules that can be activated at the target sites to release pharmacologically active drugs. 14 Although prodrugs have been proved to show elevated benefits in cancer treatment, 15 the mechanisms responsible for its functionalization and the methods to study their activation within cells are rarely been explored, which calls for more related efforts. 16 Therefore, in this study, the lipid and drug were covalently combined in the form of a prodrug and then prepared into nanoparticles to achieve a satisfactory drugloading. Meanwhile, the covalently linked bonds could achieve responsive cleavage at the target site to release the drug.

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have emerged as promising therapeutic delivery vehicles for a wide range of drugs over the past few decades. The amphipathic and biodegradable nature of the lipid nanomaterials makes them attractive for encapsulating both hydrophobic and hydrophilic therapeutic drugs for drug delivery. [1] The great success of COVID-19 mRNAlipid vaccines have rightly put lipids on the spotlight again. [2] NPs can be categorized into two main groups: liposomes with a water core and lipid bilayer structure, and solid LNPs. However, most LNPs in the clinical context have limited drug loading (< 10 wt%). [3] While the emulsion/solvent evaporation method can produce NPs with drug loading up to 14%, other common approaches such as traditional nanoprecipitation method or evaporation method can only achieve a drug loading less than 5%. [4,5] Such a low drug loading requires the excessive use of nanocarriers to achieve the therapeutic threshold of drugs, leading to toxic side effects and degradation burden. [6] In contrast, high drug loading NPs offer advantages such as improving intravenous injection compatibility, minimizing material toxicity, reducing manufacturing cost and increasing production scalability. [3,6] Meanwhile, it has been demonstrated that cells are only able to uptake a limited number of NPs. According to a previous research, SKOV3 cells have been shown to have a limited capacity for NPs cellular uptake, with a maximum of 1.9 \u00d7 10 5 particles taken up by a single SKOV3 cell. [7] Therefore, a minimum number of NPs with sufficient amount of drug loaded is beneficial for delivering a maximum amount of drug. [7] It is therefore of great significance to develop LNPs with tunable drug loading, ranging from low to very high, thereby reducing the need for excessive use of nanocarriers and improving drug delivery efficacy. \n\n14] Among the approaches, nanoprecipitation is the simplest method for lipid-based nanoparticle production, and does not require high-shear force/high-temperature/high-pressure.

            "text": "The versatility in the field of nanomedicine is evolving with passing time and extensive investigations are being performed by scientists worldwide. The nano-drug delivery systems are classified as polymeric systems, such as nanocapsules, nanospheres, nanofibres, and nanodiscs, and lipid-based systems, such as liposomes, transferosomes, ethosomes, niosomes, virosomes, phytosomes, micelles, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), and nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC) systems. \n\nLipid nanoparticles (LNPs) gained attention in the early 1990s when the first-generation SLNs were created [1]. The SLNs created a lot of interest worldwide and quite several research groups started working on SLNs in the first years of their discovery, and to date, SLNs remain an alternative approach to current conventional carriers, such as emulsions, liposomes, and polymeric nanoparticles [2,3]. The SLNs are within the range of submicron (50-1,000 nm) and the appropriate selection of lipids and surfactants will affect particle size (PS), long-term storage stability, drug loading (DL), and release behaviors [4,5]. Their major benefit is the prospect of their large-scale industrial development [6,7]. Possible SLN-related problems, such as restricted DL capacity, change in drug release profile, and expulsion of drugs during storage, are either avoided or minimized using the new-generation NLCs [8]. \n\nNLCs are the second generation of SLNs, composed of a binary mixture of solid lipid and liquid lipid, the average size in the range of 10-500 nm [9]. Here, the solid lipid is mixed with the liquid lipids preferably in a ratio of 70:30 up to 99.9:0.1. They contain a special nanostructure, which results in the improvement in DL as well as firm incorporation of the drug inside increasing the storage time. The NLCs can be administered to the patients using oral, topical, intravenous (IV), as well as ocular routes [10].",

            "text": "Lipid-based, polymeric and inorganic nanoparticles have been extensively studied for the effective delivery of drugs across the BBB via a noninvasive pathway [170]. \n\nThe polymers used in NP formulation can be natural or synthetic. Some of the most widely used natural polymers are chitosan, cellulose and gelatin. As for synthetic polymers, polylactic acid and poly-(lactide-coglycolide) are commonly used. These NPs have been widely researched due to their potentially high versatility and biocompatibility, depending on the chosen polymer [170,203,204]. \n\nThe use of polymer NPs has a few critical disadvantages which has hindered their market application, such as the toxicity of some of the polymers, the presence of solvent residues during production and purification, high cost, degradability, difficulty in the application of large-scale production and the requirement for high quality and high purity polymers [204]. \n\nInorganic NPs display some advantages over polymeric NPs, namely, in terms of the control of size and shape, the ease of production and functionalization and ease of tracking by microscopy or analytic techniques. They also provide a stronger support for the nanostructure than organic-based structures. These NPs are made using heavy metals or semiconductive metals such as gold, silica or carbon. However, these NPs have some disadvantages, e.g., they might not be degraded or eliminated through the kidneys, or may cause undesired long-term toxicity [170,205]. \n\nLipid-based NPs have several advantages that justify increased investment in their development. These types of particles display protection against chemical and enzymatic degradation, lipid compatibility, gradual release of active compound from the lipid matrix, diminished adverse side effects and chronic toxicity. Furthermore, they hold the possibility of production without the use of organic solvents (e.g., via the high-pressure homogenization method) and easy scale-up [203,204]. \n\nOf the many NPs being investigated by scientists, lipid-based NPs have taken the lead, due to the aforementioned advantages, along with their biocompatibility and versatility.",

            "text": "Lipid-based nanoparticles, which are typically spherical in shape and contain a lipid bilayer that encapsulates aqueous compartments, provide several benefits as a drug delivery system. These benefits include the ability to transport substantial payloads, biocompatibility, excellent bioavailability, and the simplicity of formulation [40]. As a result, lipid-based NPs have emerged as the predominant class of FDA-approved nanomedicines, owing to their versatility and efficacy [41]. Among the various subsets of lipid-based nanocarriers, liposomes are particularly prominent. Liposomes are typically composed of phospholipids, enabling the formation of unilamellar or multilamellar vesicular structures. This unique property of liposomes enables them to efficiently carry and deliver a wide range of drugs, including hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds. Different things can affect how stable liposomes are, both in the lab and in living things. These include the size of the nanoparticles, their surface charge, the type of lipids they contain, the number of lamellae they have, and any changes to their surface that involve ligands or polymers [42,43]. To stop the reticuloendothelial system from taking them up quickly, liposomes are often modified on the outside to make them last longer in the bloodstream and carry drugs better. These modifications have played a crucial role in facilitating the clinical utilization of liposomes. The nanodispersions made up of uniformly dispersed nanoparticles in a liquid media, with sizes ranging from 1 to 100 nm. Moreover, the surface area increases with decrease in particle size, which improves the rate of breakdown and absorption of the dispersed materials. In pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and culinary goods, these dispersions are frequently employed to increase the solubility, stability, and bioavailability of active substances [44]. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a notable subgroup within lipid-based NPs that are extensively employed for nucleic acid delivery, offering improved stability, protection, and targeted delivery capabilities.",

[171,172] However, the challenges still exist for the application of different types of nanoparticle carriers. Lipid NPs are favored by vaccine developers because they have a high drug delivery efficiency and are easily manufactured. The current use of microfluidics to generate LNPs, which encapsulate mRNA in LNPs before entering the body, is the only FDA-approved mRNA delivery technology on the market, and its safety and efficacy have been demonstrated in this pandemic. [173] However, improving the stability of LNP vaccines remains a challenge, particularly in the case of non-thermal formulations. Although materials such as polyethylene glycol can improve the stability of the system, recent reports have shown that mRNA cargoes in Pfizer/Biotech and Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine must still be held at ultra-low temperatures to maintain their stability. [174] o address this issue, the application of engineered nanoscale transport systems can help to improve the overall thermal stability of the cargo carried, and optimizing the appropriate route of administration can help to improve the effectiveness and durability of drug-or vaccine-induced immune protection. \n\nProtein assembly based vaccine candidates are another powerful strategy due to their plasticity and diversity. [175] The use of protein assemblies has several advantages over other nanocarriers: [175][176][177][178] (1) they allow multiple pathogenic units to be retained in an assembled structure, maintaining the original activity of the assembly; (2) repetitive surface patterns and a particulate structure that triggers a strong immune response, and (3) they can be designed to prevent enrichment and amplification of pathogenic components. However, for generic vaccine applications, the selection of VLP candidates based on the type of immune response and the development of effective design strategies remain challenging.",

For instance, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) can be used for the targeted delivery of therapeutic molecules, increasing their bioavailability and pharmacokinetic properties beyond the Lipinski rules (1). Indeed, the development of nucleic acid therapeutics has long been hampered by the inherent hydrophilic nature, large size, and poor membrane permeability of nucleic acids (2). LNPs can be a potent alternative to viral-mediated nucleic acid delivery, with an extensive range of applications such as RNA interference (RNAi) therapy or RNA-based vaccines through intracellular delivery, respectively, of short interfering RNA (siRNA) or messenger RNA (mRNA) (3).\n\nOne of the primary advantages associated with LNPs is their biocompatibility that enables their use in vivo for human therapy (4,5). LNPs are made of two major components: a lipid phase and a water phase containing surfactants. LNPs are generally divided into liposomes with an aqueous core or other LNPs; the latter could be solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) with a solid core and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) featuring a core that is a mixture of solid and molten lipids (6). This subclass of LNPs was initially designed to improve the colloidal stability of lipid carriers and increase the drug payload into the core by controlling the release profile (7). Moreover, they are considered advantageous because their manufacturing processes can be easily scaled up for large production (8).\n\nDue to the nature of their lipid core, these particles are not well adapted for nucleic acid encapsulation. The loading of biomacromolecules such as siRNA or mRNA, therefore, occurs through the association with their shell either by chemical modifications of Polyethylene glycol (PEG) residues (9) or by incorporation of cationic lipids at the level of phospholipid monolayer, thus allowing electrostatic interactions with negatively charged nucleic acids (9)(10)(11)(12).

A compound nanoparticle drug delivery system in interaction with lymph nodes is shown in Fig. 1. \n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration alludes to nanomaterials as materials with particles in the range of 1 to 100 with properties different from the bulk material [4,5]. Nanofibers, nanoplates, nanowires, quantum dots, and other related materials have been characterized [6]. Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) are a type of lipid nanoparticles (LN), which can be constructed by utilizing solid lipids [7]. Subsequent versions of SLNs have been developed such as nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs), which represent the second era of LN [8]. Both SLN and NLC are built from solid lipids. The interior structure of SLN contains solid lipids, while NLC is developed utilizing a mixture of solid and liquid lipids, which produce precious stone cross section [9,10]. These flaws have additionally been reported for SLNs in light of the fact that SLNs that contain many solid lipid segments can be used in medical applications [11,12]. Polymeric nanoparticles (PN) can be built from natural polymers or inorganic materials, for example, silica [13]. The polymers or lipids shape the core of NPs, which improve stability and drug delivery and offer uniform shape and size [14]. \n\nPN can be described as nanocapsules or nanospheres. The nanocapsules contain oil in a vesicular structure along with a drug [15,16], while nanospheres contain polymeric chains without oil [17,18]. A drug is packed in PNs through blending with the polymer. The incorporation of the drug is ensured in the nanoparticles at the time of polymerization. PNs are loaded with a drug by dissolving, scattering, or artificially adsorbing it in the constituents of the polymer network [19,20].",

Following on SLNs, nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) have been developed to enhance drug encapsulation and prevent drug leakage. NLCs are composed of an unstructured lipid interior and a monolayer surfactant periphery (Figure 2). The core is made of a mixture of solid and liquid lipids that form an imperfect crystal interior to increase the drug loading, while SLNs are saturating the drug loading due to a solid crystal lattice. In addition, this liquid phase in NLC inhibits drug release during storage [36]. \n\nMoreover, lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles have been studied to create synergies between lipid-based nanoparticles and polymeric particles. Indeed, Zhang et al. made a comparison between lipid-based nanoparticles, polymeric nanoparticles and the hybrid nanoparticles loaded with cisplatin, where the in vivo data suggests that cisplatin-loaded lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles inhibited the ovarian carcinoma most effectively [37]. Additionally, these hybrid particles have also been considered in gene delivery applications [24,38]. By optimizing the properties of lipid-based nanoparticles, the safety, encapsulating capacity, stability, pharmacokinetics, bio-distribution, and therapeutic benefit can be controlled as a result [39].",

Moreover, LNPs are easily scalable for manufacturing, possess the ability to encapsulate and protect biotherapeutics, exhibit good long-term stability, offer prolonged drug release effects, have small sizes that facilitate cellular internalization, allow for surface modification to promote drug targeting, and facilitate drug transport across the BBB [103][104][105][106][107]. While lipid nanoparticles show promise for delivering drugs to the brain due to t ability of drugs to cross the BBB, their efficacy is hindered by several limitations. One the constraints is the induction of immune responses, leading to clearance by the body causing adverse reactions [176,177]. Targeting specific brain regions remains a hurdle b cause the complex biological environment of the brain may impede the efficient transpo and release of therapeutic payloads from the nanoparticles [178]. Therefore, although lip nanoparticles provide pathways for brain drug delivery, the existing drawbacks need be addressed for the successful application of LNPs in treating neurological disorders.",

            "text": "Lipid-based nanoparticles have been the most common class of nanomedicines approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [44]. Lipid-based nanoparticles are excellent platforms for the encapsulation of diverse hydrophobic or hydrophilic therapeutics, including small molecules, proteins, and nucleic acids. Their multiple advantages include formulation and synthesis simplicity, self-assembly, biocompatibility, and high bioavailability [45]. Common fabrication techniques for lipid-based nanocarriers are highpressure homogenization, high-speed stirring, ultrasonication, emulsion/solvent evaporation, double emulsion, phase inversion, and solvent injection [46]. \n\nLipid-based NPs are divided into several types of systems: liposomal NPs, composed of a lipid bilayer enclosing a hydrophilic core; lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), liposome-like structures with diverse morphologies that usually form an inverse micelle within the core to encapsulate hydrophilic agents; and solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNPs) composed of a lipid monolayer enclosing a solid lipid core [47]. Gene delivery systems often use LNPs to encapsulate nucleic acids in spherical vesicles composed of several materials: ionizable or cationic lipids, helper lipids, and polyethylene glycol (PEG) [48]. Ionizable lipids, which are neutral at physiological pH and positively charged at low pH, are embedded in the micellar structure of LNPs to complex with negatively charged genetic material, aid endosomal escape, and protect against nuclease-mediated degradation [49,50]. Helper lipids such as distearoylphosphatidylcholine and cholesterol, promote cell membrane binding and provide structural rigidity. Because LNPs can be rapidly taken up by the reticuloendothelial system, PEG is commonly used to decorate the NP surface to increase bioavailability in the human body [51].",

            "text": "Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) are the most widely studied LNP for lipophilic drug delivery (Figure 1). SLNs are synthesized through emulsification between an organic phase containing a solid lipid and a water phase containing a surfactant at a temperature slightly higher than the melting temperature of the solid lipid. SLNs consist of a solid lipid internal structure to enhance the stability of the DDS. Therefore, they can protect drugs more from external environmental conditions than nano-emulsion-type LNPs [55]. Therefore, they are attracting attention for oral administration because they can protect drugs from extreme conditions such as gastric acid [26,56]. From a formulation point of view, SLNs offer advantages, such as excellent biodegradability, physical stability, and controlled drug release [57][58][59]. Owing to these properties, SLNs are considered an attractive alternative to emulsion LNPs. Lipophilic drug delivery studies using SLNs have been actively conducted in various disease models (Table 1). However, the high-temperature emulsification process to obtain a uniform solid lipid core can limit using SLNs in delivering drugs unstable to heat and physical shock. In addition, SLNs have limited commercialization because of their high initial burst drug release and leakage during storage owing to the crystallization of solid lipids during the cooling process after synthesis [59][60][61][62].",

            "text": "One major reason for using LNP is their ability to control drug release kinetics. The drug delivery kinetics from LNP depends on their composition, the nature of the active molecule, and its localization inside the nanoparticle. The interactions between the active molecule and the liquid and solid lipids are especially crucial. In vitro tests have shown that LNP dispersions generally provide a prolonged release of loaded drugs [7]. The constraints of the in vivo environment can, however, require some adaptations to the design of LNP. To improve the blood half-life of the particles, PEG-based surfactants can be included as membrane ingredients. Adding PEG chains on the surface of the nanoparticle allows to prolong systemic circulation time and decrease immunogenicity [27,28]. \n\nWhile LNP provide stability and enhance the solubility of hydrophobic active molecules, drug release from LNP still, sometimes, displays a characteristic burst effect profile. This is especially the case when the active molecule is located both in the core and at the membrane of the lipid nanoparticle [5]. This specific kinetics can be desirable for transdermal delivery; it creates a mono-layer of the active ingredient on the skin, improving the drug permeation through the stratum corneum [29,30]. However, it is also often seen as undesirable because of its contribution to local or systemic drug toxicity and because it also reduces the blood half-time of the drug. It may lead to a poor delivery of the active ingredient and a poor therapeutic outcome. \n\nMoreover, when LNP are used for dermal, transdermal or ocular drug delivery, they need to be dispersed in a 3D mechanical matrix to remain at the administration site to prevent undesired systemic and local side-effects (irritation, inflammation). The encapsulation of LNP inside a suitable delivery vehicle could prevent such negative features. Indeed, a double encapsulation system-drug loaded into LNP, themselves entrapped in a vehicle material-could provide spatial and temporal control over drug delivery. Moreover, the vehicle, as is the case for certain hydrogels, can display interesting properties such as muco-adhesion and enhanced biocompatibility [31].",

Polymeric nanoparticles: Nanoparticles (NPs) are, colloidal particles, less than 1000 nm, that can be used for better drug delivery and prepared either by encapsulating the drug within a vesicle and or by dispersing the drug molecules within a matrix 32 . Nanoparticulate drug delivery systems have been extensively studied in recent years for spatial and temporal delivery, especially in tumour and brain targeting. NPs have great promise for better drug delivery as found in both pharmaceutical and clinical research. As a drug carrier, NPs have significant advantages like better bioavailability, systemic stability, high drug loading, long blood circulation time and selective distribution in the organs/tissues with longer half life. Nanoparticles, prepared from a wide variety of biodegradable/biocompatible polymers such as poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA), poly(D,Llactide) (PLA), polybutyl cyanoacrylates (PBCA), polycaprolactone (PCL) etc are extensively used for the delivery of drugs to the central nervous system.",

The solid lipid nanoparticles are sub-micron colloidal carriers (50-100 nm) which are composed of physiological lipid, dispersed in water or in aqueous surfactant solution. SLNs as colloidal drug carrier combines the advantage of polymeric nanoparticles fat emulsions and liposomes. In order to overcome the disadvantages associated with the liquid state of the oil droplets, the liquid lipid was replaced by solid lipid which eventually transformed into solid lipid nanoparticles. Solid lipid nanoparticles possess a solid lipid core matrix that cansolubilize lipophilic molecules. The lipid core is stabilized by surfactants (emulsifiers) [1].",

            "text": "Lipid-based nanoparticles (LNPs) are another popular nanoparticle of choice and have been clinically used for a variety of FDA-approved applications, ranging from ONPATTRO \u00ae polyneuropathy therapy to the mRNA-1274 (Moderna, Cambridge, MA, USA) and BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech, New York, NY, USA) COVID-19 vaccines [47,48]. One reason for this is their high degree of biocompatibility and their reduced risk of producing inflammatory responses due to lipids' status as a natural component of the cell membrane [21]. Another advantage is the ability of liposomal NPs to encapsulate hydrophobic molecules in their lipid bilayer, hydrophilic molecules in their aqueous core, or both simultaneously, giving them compatibility with diverse payloads. Conversely, other lipid-containing NPs incorporate hydrophobic molecules into the lipid construct before mixing with the aqueous phase for NP synthesis [49]. LNPs have been shown to deliver not only small molecules, such as anti-cancer drugs and chemotherapy agents [50,51], but also, more recently, nucleic acids. LNPs encapsulated with siRNA targeting ApoB [52], PCSK9 [53], PLK1 [54], VEGF, and KSP [52] expression are just a few examples, along with those delivering self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) [55] and mRNA [50][51][52][53][54][55]. The enhanced flexibility for payloads of diverse chemical properties also allows opportunities for the co-delivery of molecules, such as a combination of antigenic material with tolerogenic agents (e.g., suppressive cytokines and broad immunosuppressants) [56]. Additionally, other LNPs have been surface-modified with engineered peptides and whole membrane proteins, providing further avenues for their possible use as antigen-specific immune tolerance therapeutics [57]. Finally, a low-shear extrusion manufacturing method can minimize the protein denaturation risk during encapsulation.",

The most widely used LNPs included solid lipid nanoparticle (SLN) and nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC). The advantages of LNPs included biocompatibility, controlled and sustained release of anti-tumor drugs, and lower systemic toxicity, especially hugged the advantage to delivery mRNA for tumor immunotherapy [194,195]. For the components of LNPs, typical LNPs were composed of cationic lipids, ionizable lipids, or helper lipids. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) lipids or surfactants may be also added to improve colloidal stability of the LNPs [196,197]. At present, the potential clinical application of LNPs mainly lies in effectively modulating mRNA delivery to improve the immunotherapeutic effects. Naked mRNA was unstable, and can be rapidly degraded by nucleases and Fig. 9 A summary of liposomes used in tumor immunotherapy to inhibit tumor progression. The 7 kinds of liposomes mentioned in this manuscript increase the infiltration of CD8 + T cells, decrease the level of immune suppressive T cells, promote the maturation of DCs, and induce the macrophage transformation from M2 type to M1 type and restore tumor immunity to inhibit tumor progression self-hydrolysis. Encapsulation of mRNA by LNPs could protect naked mRNA from extracellular ribonucleases and contributed to the intracellular mRNA delivery. As a result, the therapeutic effect of these mRNA can be fully performed. Many studies have convinced this point [198][199][200][201]. \n\nFirst, the LNPs vector have the adjuvant effect.

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) as nanocarriers for the delivery of oligonucleotide-based therapeutics have sparked a profound change in the industry sector, due to their success in delivering vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic. The successful global implementation of LNPs has seen a rapid growth in research into their applications for the delivery of cargo in a range of therapy areas of unmet clinical need. Alterations in LNP constituent lipids and ratios have led to the discovery of a broad spectrum of prospective nanomedicine candidates in pharmaceutical industry pipelines, increasing the popularity of LNPs and their versatility and applicability to a diverse molecular portfolio [1][2][3][4][5]. \n\nThe successful clinical and commercial translation of LNPs for oligonucleotide delivery depends on acceptable formulation physicochemical stability of the nanocarrier during its shelf life, and the ability to protect oligonucleotide cargo from premature degradation. Highlighted by recent reviews [6,7], there is a critical need for the development of orthogonal analytical pipelines to profile prototype LNP physicochemical attributes during early formulation development stages. Once manufactured, the LNP formulation critical quality attributes (CQAs) are quantified using established techniques, such as dynamic light scattering (DLS: size and polydispersity), electrophoretic light scattering (ELS: zeta potential) and the RiboGreen\u2122 assay (drug encapsulation efficiency and recovery) [8][9][10]. Due to significant research interest and field novelty, the characterisation of prototype LNP candidates remains on a case-by-case basis. Continuing the process to harmonise the measurement of LNP physicochemical attributes, the Nanotechnology Characterisation Laboratory (NCL) and European NCL have issued guidelines for the analysis of prototype nanoparticulate formulations [11][12][13]; they recommend the use of at least one low-resolution technique and an orthogonal high-resolution technique for the measurement of nanoparticle size, ensuring that robust and representative results are obtained while standardised reference materials are under development.",

A variety of delivery platform vehicles are under development to target immune cells, such as antibodies (16), polymers (17), aptamers (18), and lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) (19,20). In comparison to other NPs, LNPs have attractive biological properties, which include general biocompatibility, biodegradability, and the ability to entrap both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs (15,21). Multiple properties of LNPs can be altered via different lipid composition and ratios or by surface chemistry, including their size, charge, and surface functionality (22). LNPs serve as carriers for a variety of therapeutic molecules: from nucleic acid to proteins, small molecules and chemotherapy drugs, and combinations of the aforementioned agents (22)(23)(24). LNPs shelter their cargo from clearance in the surrounding biological milieu, increasing the half-life in circulation, minimizing systemic toxicity, and hence enabling a wide therapeutic window (15,22,25). In addition, LNPs can promote delivery of their cargo directly to specific immune cell, such as APC or T-lymphocytes (20,26,27). Here, we review the latest developments in nanoparticle-based cancer immunotherapy, centering on LNPs.",

            "text": "Fabricating LNP via microfluidics bears several advantages including precise control over parameters, high reproducibility, and the possibility for industrial scale-up [10,11]. Properties of LNP can be affected by various factors, including FRR, TFR, dimensions of the chip, lipid composition, and buffer choice [32,42]. The success of this method was further proven with the admission of the COVID-19 vaccines [10,42]. Besides the delivery of nucleic acids, those lipidbased nanocarriers including liposomes, self-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SEDDS) and LNP can be promising formulations for oral drug delivery as well. Nevertheless, these systems should stay physically stable, meaning the particles should maintain a homogenous size distribution and prevent aggregation which could further cause phase separation and escape of the encapsulated drug [43]. Furthermore, the formulation can be impacted by lipid degradation either during storage or within the gastrointestinal tract. Especially changes in pH from acidic conditions in the stomach to neutral or alkaline environments in the intestine, variable concentration of salts, and electrolytes and gastrointestinal enzymes like pancreatic lipase are able to degrade those lipid-based nanocarriers, and continuing decomposition could as well lead to undesired drug release [44][45][46]. Possible strategies to overcome these problems can be based on suitable surface coating, e.g., PEG which sterically stabilizes the particles preventing aggregation and also hampers the adsorption of enzymes [45,47]. Moreover, non-digestible components can be chosen for the composition of the nanoparticles. LNP in our study were based on cholesterol, DSPC as structural lipid, MPEG-2000-DSPE as PEGylated lipid, and positive surfactants providing a positive surface charge of LNP. Cholesterol can improve the stability of LNP by modulating the integrity and rigidity of the cellular membrane [11,42,48,49]. DSPC is able to form a lamellar phase which stabilizes the structure of LNP and furthermore facilitates endosomal escape [11,48].",

This structure enables LNPs to effectively encapsulate and deliver diverse oligonucleotides, including siRNA, mRNA, and plasmid DNA. \n\nLNPs are renowned for their excellent stability and efficient intracellular delivery, making them highly suitable for nucleic-acid-based therapy. Lipid-based nanoparticles offer a diverse range of options for drug delivery. Each type exhibits unique properties that can be tailored to meet the specific requirements of the therapeutic cargo. Factors such as the nature of the cargo, desired release kinetics, and the targeted delivery site play crucial roles in selecting the appropriate lipid-based nanoparticles. Ongoing research and development in this field hold immense promise for advancing drug delivery strategies and improving therapeutic outcomes. \n\nRecently, LNPs have been actively investigated for the delivery of RNA-based biopharmaceuticals [11,12]. Although non-viral vectors such as LNP have lower efficiency than viral vectors, the former are biosafe and have the advantage of being able to carry large mRNA sequences [13,14]. Furthermore, LNPs can easily fulfill three requirements for nucleic acid delivery vehicles: efficient encapsulation to resist degradation by nucleases, a mechanism for targeted delivery and intracellular entry, and a manufacturing process that allows for the mass production of uniformly sized nanoparticles [15]. The cargo content and physicochemical properties (particle size, shape, surface charge, etc.) of LNPs can be controlled by adjusting the lipid composition [16]. \n\nNanoparticles containing cationic lipids have been widely studied as carriers of genes and nucleic acids because of their ability to carry negatively charged nucleic acids and attach to the lipid bilayer of cells [17]. However, cytotoxicity due to cationic lipids and rapid elimination from the body are limitations [18]. To compensate for this, ionizable lipids that are neutral in circulation and positively charged only in endosomes have been developed and actively studied [19].",

            "text": "The last decade has seen interesting developments in the field of lipid-polymer hybrid nanotechnology. There has been an exponential increase in the number of studies performed using these hybrid systems, with a dazzling array of surface coatings and encapsulated cargoes. Not only have these LPNs been used to deliver therapeutic molecules such as small molecules, plasmids, siRNA, proteins and peptides, they have also been used to deliver diagnostic molecules such as iron oxide nanoparticles, fluorescent dyes, quantum dots and gold nanoparticles. These systems have been tested in both in vitro and in vivo models. \n\nAlthough LPNs encompass the advantages of both polymeric nanoparticles and liposomes, they present new challenges that may impede clinical translation. For example, a multi-step synthesis process is required due to the use of two classes of biomaterials (lipids and polymers), which may make scale-up manufacturing more challenging. There are also additional economic and quality considerations when produ-cing the LPNs on a large scale. Researchers need to define all of the component ingredients at a molecular level, and evaluate their safety and biocompatibility in vivo. Thus, the development of simple and scalable protocols for the synthesis of LPNs, using FDA-approved materials with highly predictable in vivo characteristics, will enable faster clinical translation. \n\nAlthough LPNs present a number of advantages in that they can deliver both hydrophobic and hydrophilic cargo and also be functionalized for active targeting, more studies need to be done at the pre-clinical stage. For example, the majority of cancer therapeutic studies reported in the literature using LPNs have only been tested in in vitro models. More investigational new drug (IND) type studies focusing on in vivo antitumor efficacy, biodistribution, clearance and long-term toxicity will need to be performed. \n\nApart from IND studies, there are also several interesting novel techniques that could be explored further. One such example is the recent development of 'cell ghosts', which are LPN-like nanoparticles that use biologically derived lipid membranes isolated from cells in place of synthetic lipids. 87 Such nanoparticles may have unique biological functionalities depending upon the cell type chosen and hold immense potential for cancer treatment.",

            "text": "LNPs are lipid vesicle delivery systems that are nonviral and multifunctional, comprising ionizable lipids as the primary components, cholesterol, phospholipids for structural integrity, and PEG-modified lipids to aid in maintaining stability (Fig. 2B) [117]. Following extensive research, LNPs have been utilized for the administration of various vaccines and have significantly enhanced both humoral and cellular immune responses. LNPs can stimulate robust follicular Th cells, durable plasma cells, B cells in germinal centers, and memory B cells, resulting in enhanced humoral immune reactions after vaccination [133]. Recently, LNPs have been extensively studied as potential carriers for mRNA vaccines in clinical trials of COVID-19, tumor vaccines, and influenza vaccines. For example, emergency marketing authorizations were granted in 2020 for Pfizer's BNT162b2 vaccine (Comirnaty) and Moderna's mRNA-1273 vaccine (Spikevax), both of which utilize LNPs for mRNA antigen delivery [134,135]. The successful use of these two mRNA vaccines has yielded exciting results and made significant contributions to the fight against COVID-19. LNPs have accelerated the utilization of mRNAs in humans, and their promising prospects in vaccine development are highly anticipated. Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) are a type of lipidbased nanocarrier comprising active pharmaceutical ingredients and solid lipids, along with surfactants and/ or co-surfactants. They serve as vaccine delivery systems that entrap drugs within natural or synthetic solid lipids, such as lecithin, acting as carriers [136]. Their internal oil phase was replaced with a solid lipid to reduce the limitations associated with conventional lipid formulations, avoid the use of organic solvents during preparation, provide better stability, reduce drug degradation, and maintain relative stability during storage. SLNs play a pivotal role in various applications in nanotechnology, such as vaccine delivery and cancer treatment, owing to their capacity to encapsulate both hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds, biocompatibility, and ease with which their surface can be modified [118].",

The use of nanoparticles can ensure the stability and solubility of the loaded ingredients or drugs, promote transmembrane transport, and significantly improve hemostatic efficacy. Nanoparticles formed from natural and synthetic polymers exhibit good drugloading stability and are easily surface-modified. Controlled release and targeting of drugs can be achieved by modulating the properties of polymers and by realizing surface modifications. Nanoparticles are classified into several categories according to their chemical composition: liposome-based nanoparticles (LNPs), polymeric nanoparticles, and inorganic nanoparticles. \n\nLNPs are extensively studied as drug delivery carriers. These nanoparticles generally comprise ionized cationic lipids, phospholipids, cholesterol, and polyethylene glycol lipids. LNPs exploit the properties of phospholipid molecules to penetrate cell membranes, laying the foundation for the development of drug delivery carriers. Chen et al. used LNPs to wrap hemostatic macromolecules such as thrombin and studied the activation of platelets in the presence of LNPs loaded with thrombin. They conducted in vitro platelet contraction assays and thromboelastography tests to arrive at the results [222]. It was observed that platelet endocytosis of LNPs loaded with thrombin significantly increased the sensitivity of platelets toward collagen and significantly accelerated the time to clot formation. An increase in clot stiffness was also observed. Its introduction into the plasma of patients suffering from coagulation disorders also markedly accelerated the time of formation of blood clots. Attention should be paid to the fact that thrombin not fully encapsulated by LNPs may activate platelets prematurely, resulting in rapid platelet activation and thrombosis. LNPs equipped with ADP could also effectively activate and aggregate platelets, thus significantly shortening the clotting time in a rabbit liver defect model. Thrombus formation in arteries is avoided under these conditions [222].",

            "text": "Thus, many researchers have focused on the possibility of treating various diseases using LCCs [20,21]. Numerous studies have been conducted to improve the bioavailability of liposomes, such as drug loading, increased residence time in the body, extrusion to ensure uniform size, and antibody-based targeting [22,23]. These efforts have led to clinical trials in various medical fields, including liposomebased anticancer drugs, antibiotics, gene therapy, and anesthetics [20]. Currently, many liposome-based treatments, such as Doxyl \u00ae (doxorubicin), AmBisome \u00ae (Amphotericin B), and daunoXome \u00ae (daunorubicin), have been approved and used in medicine [24]. However, the high production cost, limited physical stability, low drug-loading capacity, leakage of encapsulated drugs, and complexity and use of toxic organic solvents in the manufacturing process restrict the commercialization of liposomes [25,26]. This situation requires a new alternative; thus, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) were developed as novel LCCs to overcome the limitations of liposomes [21,25]. LNPs comprise lipids, surfactants, polymers, and emulsions or colloidal nanoparticle structures [27,28]. Unlike liposomes, LNPs mainly consist of phospholipids, a surfactantbased monolayer, and an interior filled with hydrophobic materials (Figure 1) [24]. The synthesis of LNPs is more straightforward to scale up than that of liposomes because they are produced by emulsification between an organic phase and an aqueous phase using the properties of surfactants [29,30]. In addition, they have many advantages, such as a low cytotoxicity, low cost, high stability, and drug-loading efficiency [6]. Previous studies on LNP preparation, characterization, drug loading, and delivery have demonstrated their great potential as a DDS. Generally, drugs are loaded in the carrier during the manufacturing process. Thus, their hydrophobic internal structural characteristics make them suitable for lipophilic drug delivery.",

Their ability to encapsulate and protect fragile nucleic acid cargo, such as mRNA and siRNA, while facilitating cellular uptake and endosomal escape, has positioned LNPs as the leading delivery system for mRNA vaccines. This is evidenced by the rapid development and deployment of mRNA-based vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 (Comirnaty \u00ae and Spikevax\u2122 [1]) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (mRESVIA \u00ae ), which demonstrates the scalability, safety, and efficacy of LNP formulations in clinical settings. \n\nAdvancements in LNP design have focused on optimising their composition, which typically includes an ionizable lipid, a phospholipid, cholesterol, and a PEGylated lipid. These components synergistically enhance the stability, cellular delivery, and biocompatibility of LNPs. Additionally, innovations in LNP manufacturing technologies, such as microfluidic techniques, have enabled precise control over particle size and reproducibility, further enhancing the development and clinical application of LNPs. \n\nThe performance of LNPs for mRNA delivery is dependent on their potency, in vivo distribution and targeting, ability to induce an immune response, and inherent adjuvanticity [2]. Cellular uptake of these LNPs is a multi-step process mediated by the LNP's size and the interaction between LNPs and biological fluids, specifically biomolecules such as immunoglobulins and lipoproteins [3]. LNPs can be internalised by several methods, including micropinocytosis and clathrin-mediated endocytosis, with the endocytic pathway dependent on the nanoparticle properties and the type of cells [4]. After entering the cells, the LNPs enter the endosome, where the ionisable lipid becomes protonated due to the lower, acidic pH in the endosomal compartment.",

These nanoparticles serve as carriers to protect mRNA from degradation, facilitate cellular uptake, and enhance vaccine efficacy. Here, we explore several prominent methods along with their applications and implications in mRNA vaccine development. \n\nPolymeric Nanoparticles: Polymeric nanoparticles are widely investigated due to their versatility, biocompatibility, and ability to encapsulate and deliver mRNA effectively. Methods such as nanoprecipitation, emulsion solvent evaporation, and electrospinning are commonly employed for their synthesis. For instance, poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles synthesized via nanoprecipitation have shown promise in encapsulating mRNA, protecting it from enzymatic degradation, and facilitating controlled release kinetics [80]. \n\nLipid-Based Nanoparticles: Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are another pivotal class of nanoparticles for mRNA vaccine delivery. LNPs typically consist of ionizable lipids, cholesterol, and PEGylated lipids, which stabilize and protect mRNA during delivery. Methods such as microfluidics and double emulsion techniques are utilized to produce LNPs with precise particle sizes and surface characteristics. LNPs have demonstrated high transfection efficiency and immune response induction, making them a leading candidate for mRNA vaccine formulations [33]. \n\nInorganic Nanoparticles: Inorganic nanoparticles, including gold nanoparticles, silica nanoparticles, and quantum dots, offer unique physical and chemical properties that can be exploited in mRNA vaccine design. Synthesis methods involve chemical reduction, sol-gel processes, and seed-mediated growth. These nanoparticles can serve as adjuvants, carriers, or imaging agents in vaccine formulations, enhancing stability and targeting specific immune responses [18]. \n\nHybrid Nanoparticles: Hybrid nanoparticles combine the advantages of different materials to achieve synergistic effects in mRNA vaccine delivery.",

            "text": "Lipids are amphipathic molecules containing a hydrophilic head, hydrophobic tail, and an intermediate that connects the two (Figure 6). The idea of LNPs was developed in the late 1960s when it was discovered that lipid bilayer vesicles spontaneously form in water, which led to liposomes being used in the delivery of mRNA (Hou et al. 2021;Mashima and Takada 2022;Tenchov et al. 2021). The use of LNPs has extended past NA delivery, where they are also used in medical imaging, nutrition, agriculture, and are an important component of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines (Tenchov et al. 2021). LNPs typically range from 50 to 100 nm in diameter, exhibit a spherical shape, and possess a micellar structure. They are characterized by enhanced kinetic stability and a more rigid morphology compared to other nanoparticle systems. LNPs enable highly efficient encapsulation, offering robustness and scalability in their manufacturing process. Additionally, they exhibit excellent stability, with a shelf life of approximately 1 year when stored at 4\u00b0C, making them a wellestablished and mature technology for therapeutic applications (Cullis and Hope 2017). LNPs are typically composed of ionizable lipids, cationic lipids, PEG-conjugated lipids, phospholipids, and cholesterol. Among these, ionizable lipids play an important role in facilitating intracellular delivery through the stabilization of NA complex and promoting endosomal escape in acidic environments (Mashima and Takada 2022;Mendes et al. 2022). Recent advancements are focused on the optimization of ionizable lipids for better biocompatibility and reduced systemic toxicity. Furthermore, branched fatty acidbased novel ionizable lipids have shown improved stability in lipid self-assembly, nucleic acid binding, and phase behavior, which may help in their overall stability. Pawlowska et al. investigated these novel ionizable lipids, showing that lipid head-group size and alkyl chain flexibility can significantly impact DNA binding capacity (Pawlowska et al. 2024).",

            "text": "Lipid-based nanoparticles (Lipid-NPs) is a nanoparticles group including liposomes, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), nanoemulsions (NEs), solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs), extracellular vesicles (EVs), and lipid polymer hybrid nanoparticles (LPHNPs) [75]. \n\nLiposomes, which are lipid-based structures, are also a prototype of lipid-NPs. They create spherical follicular systems with a variety of sizes. They can be composed of natural or synthetic phospholipids, which create a double lipid layer, surrounding an aqueous core [76]. Because it resembles structures responsible for creating cell membranes, liposomes are considered safe, with high biocompatibility, degradability, and low toxicity [75,77]. \n\nAmphiphilic character ensures the ability to transfer both hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs [75][76][77][78][79]. The liposomes were first described in 1961 by Bangham [80], and they are currently known as one of the best medicine carriers [81]. They have various applications such as protecting drugs from in vivo degradation, controlling drug release, targeted drug delivery, modulating biodistribution and enhancement of solubility, and bioavailability [77]. Moreover, by manipulating the percentage of components, the surface load of lipids, as well as the presence of surface ligands, it is possible to identify the physicochemical properties and biological effectiveness of liposomes [75]. The abovementioned modifications prevent short circulation time in human body fluids, instability in vivo and lack of targeting selectivity, which are the main flaws of unmodified liposomal carriers [82][83][84]. Kaldybekov et al. (2018) designed a drug delivery system, based on the use of a mucoadhesive carrier, applied in BC therapy-maleimide-functionalised PEGylated liposomes [85].",

            "text": "Studies have suggested that the structure and pKa of the ionizable lipids play a crucial role in the delivery efficiency of the cargo to the target cells [5,18,19]. For example, Dlin-MC3-DMA, the ionizable lipid in Onpattro (Figure 1b), with a pKa of 6.44, has a 10-fold higher potency than (2,2-dilinoleyl-4-(2-dimethylaminoethyl)- [1,3]dioxolane, DLin-KC2-DMA) with a pKa of 6.7 [20,21]. However, it should be noted that subtle differences in the lipid structure can induce variations in the structural packing of LNP's, resulting in a different morphology and delivery profile. To improve the particle stability, DSPC, with two saturated acyl chains and a large head group, is incorporated into the formulation (Figure 1b). These lipids produce a cylindrical geometry and play the role of helper lipids in the LNP to maintain the outer layer structure and increase the Onpattro's formation [22]. The PEG-DMG lipids on the particle surface (Figure 1a,b) prevent particle aggregation due to stealth properties and prolong the circulation time in vivo. Altogether, this LNP system has a solid core structure, a low surface charge at physiological media, and low immunogenicity [16]. This technology has sparked interest in further developing genetic therapies and novel delivery systems. Lipid-based nanoparticles are a particularly promising vehicle [11,23,24] for gene delivery with their higher biocompatibility than polymeric and inorganic nanoparticles, their inherent penetrating ability, their biodegradability, structural flexibility, and low immunogenicity [25,26]. These nanostructures can also be produced rapidly at large scale, which is a major advantage when moving into clinical trials and commercial applications [25]. \n\nSince the success of Doxil, Onpattro, and various other LNPs in clinical trials, a myriad of studies has been conducted to translate R&D efforts into commercial products.",

Given that various metal, inorganic, and polymer nanoparticles are already approved for human use or in late-stage clinical trials, much of the focus may shift to the derivation and coating processes of cell membranes. Fortunately, many existing industrial-scale technologies can be readily adapted for high-yield production. Various nanomaterial-based drug delivery systems have been developed, including liposomes, polymer carriers, mesoporous silica, micelles, and other nanoparticles. Among these, lipid nanoparticles are particularly widely used in the research and application of nucleic acid drugs. 148 They function as a \"cloak\" for nucleic acid molecules, tightly encapsulating them. Upon entering the body, these lipid nanoparticles protect the drug molecules from digestion and absorption by endogenous enzymes. Additionally, because their components are similar to cell membranes, they have natural affinity and can fuse with cell membranes, releasing mRNA molecules into cells to exert their therapeutic effects. 149 Mesoporous silica nanoparticles have garnered attention as nanoscale drug carriers due to their large surface area, high stability, negligible toxicity, customizable pore size, and ease of encapsulating various biomolecules. 150 ompared to liposomes, polymer nanoparticles offer high stability and inherent sustained and controlled drug release characteristics. They can prolong drug release, delay metabolism and detoxification, extend circulation time, avoid systemic clearance, and enhance intracellular uptake. Additionally, exosome delivery systems are another major method of drug delivery. 151 Exosomes are membranous vesicles released into the extracellular matrix following the fusion of multivesicular bodies with the cell membrane. \n\nPatients with NSCLC driven by genetic mutations often do not benefit from ICIs treatment, whereas nucleic acid drugs are recognized as potent tools against tumors.",

In comparison, non-viral vectors based on synthetic materials, such as polymers, lipids, peptides, and inorganic silica materials, are thought to be less immunogenic, and their features like biodegradability, chemical versatility, and ease of scaling up, continue to attract more and more researchers to develop potent and safe carriers for nucleic acid delivery (Yin et al. 2014;Kubiatowicz et al. 2022). \n\nAmong these non-viral delivery systems, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are recognized as the most clinically advanced nucleic acid delivery technology since they were used in the first FDA (the US Food and Drug Administration)-approved siRNA drug, patisiran, for the treatment of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (hATTR) and, most recently, were utilized to rapidly develop Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna's COVID-19 mRNA vaccines (BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273) against SARS-CoV-2 (Xiao and Shi 2021;Tian et al. 2023). LNPs are lipid-based sphere-shape vesicles with a diameter of 50-200 nm that are commonly composed of ionizable lipids, phospholipids, cholesterol, and polyethylene glycol (PEG)-lipids (Zong et al. 2023). While tremendous efforts, such as developing novel lipid molecules (Liu et al. 2021) and optimizing internal ratios of lipid components (Cheng et al. 2018), have been made to improve the potency of LNPs, achieving efficient nucleic acid delivery to specific organs or cell types still presents a critical challenge (Dilliard and Siegwart 2023;Kon et al. 2023;Veiga et al. 2023;Wei et al. 2022).",

            "text": "Used alone, in blends, or combined with other types of materials, polymer-based nanostructures can be used as vehicles for a variety of cargos (e.g., drugs, genes, vaccines, biomolecules, imaging agents, etc.), improving their therapeutic activity while diminishing off-target toxicity [33,34]. Moreover, polymeric systems can improve immunotherapeutic approaches due to their adjustable physicochemical properties and the possibility of functionalization with different surface ligands. Polymeric nanoparticles can target dendritic cells (which are crucial for initiating immune responses), making them highly beneficial for immunotherapeutic strategies. Furthermore, studies suggest that improving the size, shape, surface charge, and hydrophobicity of nanoparticles enhances the transport of immunotherapeutic agents to malignancies. This precise control facilitates the combination of immunotherapy treatments, avoids the reoccurrence of tumors, promotes the development of long-lasting immunological memory, and improves patient outcomes by lowering toxicity and adverse events associated with the immune system [34,35]. \n\nInteresting prospects in immunotherapy are also offered by lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). LNPs have been extensively investigated because they can be manufactured on a large scale while maintaining precise manipulation of their morphology and lipid composition [36][37][38]. Their application in tumor immunotherapy has greatly enhanced the effectiveness of antitumor treatment while minimizing negative effects on the body as a whole. Particularly, LNPs were remarked to be valuable carriers for delivering mRNA for cancer immunotherapy. LNPs provide protection to the mRNA and further augment its internalization and distribution into cells. From a clinical perspective, LNPs have effectively enabled the transport of mRNA, as demonstrated by their involvement in COVID-19 vaccines [39][40][41]. \n\nCarbon-based nanomaterials (CBNs) have also been increasingly explored for use in transporting various therapeutics, with their unique features exploited to interfere with the immune system.",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticle (LNP) technology has emerged as a promising drug delivery system after it demonstrated its effectiveness during the COVID-19 pandemic. One advantage of the LNP system is that particles can be precisely tuned by modifying its structure and surface properties, allowing specific organtargeted delivery [1][2][3]. One of the most critical quality attribute of LNPs is the particle size distribution (PSD), as it directly affects biodistribution within the body [4]. Particles smaller than 100-200 nm are generally preferred, as they exhibit enhanced permeation through biological barriers and improved accumulation in target tissues, mainly due to their efficient drainage to lymph nodes [5,4,6]. Meanwhile, larger particles are preferred when targeting liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) [7]. Additionally, larger particles have advantages in targeting antigen-presenting cells (APCs), as they are more efficiently taken up by these cells, particularly through macropinocytosis in dendritic cells [8,6]. Larger particles were reported to elicit a stronger T cell response [9]. These findings highlight the need for tuning LNP size, with consideration of the target organ and therapeutic effects [10,11]. Therefore, a manufacturing system capable of producing LNPs with a tunable size is crucial to meet the broad range of LNP applications for therapeutic uses. \n\nThe main challenges in tuning the size of LNPs arise from their complex nature, in which multiple physicochemical phenomena are interconnected. For example, LNPs are typically fabricated through the self-assembly of four major lipid components: ionizable lipids, polyethylene glycol (PEG)-lipids, phospholipids, and cholesterol [12]. This process is driven by the rapid mixing of an organic phase with an aqueous buffer, which rapidly increases the polarity of the organic phase. This sudden polarity shift induces lipid self-assembly into a dense core surrounded by lipid bilayers, encapsulating the payload [13,14].",

            "text": "The targeted delivery of therapeutic molecules to specific sites in the body represents an active area of research in the biomedical sciences involving scientists, clinicians and engineers alike. To be successful, drug delivery systems must overcome limitations that normally render a pharmaceutical agent ineffective, such as biological barriers and poor biodistribution to the desired site of action. At present, several delivery platforms have been incorporated into clinically used products, including viral vectors, molecular conjugates, antibody-drug conjugates and nanoparticles. Of those, nanoparticles are a particularly promising delivery platform because of their capacity to load different types of drugs separately or in combination, their minimal immunogenicity and their easily modulated properties through controlled chemical synthesis 1 .\n\nOne application that has received substantial attention recently is the delivery of nucleic acids for therapeutics and vaccines. Most notably, the rapid and successful deployment of the messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna represented a turning point for drug delivery 2,3 . These vaccines rely on lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) as a delivery system to shuttle mRNA past multiple biological barriers that would otherwise prevent efficacy. With over a billion doses of mRNA-LNP vaccines administered globally, LNPs for nucleic acid delivery represent one of the most widely used drug products in history. Additionally, LNPs as delivery platforms have been leveraged in multiple clinical trials for applications such as vaccination, protein replacement therapy, cancer immunotherapy, RNA interference and gene editing 4 . LNPs feature high potency, biocompatibility and the ability to be administered repeatedly, all of which are properties that favour clinical translation 4 . Therefore, it is timely to reflect on the lessons learnt from the successful development of LNPs to help devise design criteria for new clinically translatable nanoparticles based on LNPs and related materials. Polymers represent another class of materials with emerging utility for nucleic acid delivery. Multiple biomedical products, such as controlled release depots and absorbable sutures, already incorporate polymers, laying a foundation for successful clinical translation, and their properties can be controlled using chemical synthesis to produce efficacious delivery systems 5,6 . Collectively, lipid and polymer nanoparticles represent the largest",

Several lipid-based delivery systems have been clinically approved to deliver small drug molecules such as doxorubicin and vincristine [3]. In 2018, the first LNP-based drug containing small interfering RNA (siRNA) named Patisiran was approved for the treatment of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis [4]. Additional LNPs are being evaluated clinically for delivery of a wide variety of nucleic acids, including siRNA, messenger RNA (mRNA), and plasmid DNA, for both therapeutic and vaccine purposes [5][6][7]. LNPs that encapsulate nucleic acid macromolecules are generally comprised of four components: (1) an ionizable amino lipid (cationic lipid); (2) a zwitterionic phospholipid such as 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC) or 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC); (3) a neutral lipid such as cholesterol; and (4) a polyethylene glycol-lipid (PEG-lipid) [8]. The ionizable cationic lipid plays a principal role, for example, in siRNA transfection, by mediating cytosolic delivery of the siRNA through facilitated endosomal escape after LNP endocytosis. Neutral lipids, such as DSPC, 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, and cholesterol, are selected to modulate the fluidity and phase behavior of the LNP, whereas PEG-lipids are utilized to improve particle circulation half-life and systemic exposure [9].",

LNPs have also been used in various disciplines such as medical imaging, cosmetics, nutrition, agriculture, and other cutting-edge technologies such as nanoreactors. Liposomes, an early form of LNPs, are a very adaptable nanocarrier platform because they can transport both hydrophobic and hydrophilic molecules, such as tiny molecules, proteins, and nucleic acids. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), such as solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) and nanostructured lipid carriers, were developed to address limitations in colloidal carriers, such as emulsions and liposomes, and polymeric nanoparticles, such as rapid release via the reticuloendothelial system, cell interactions and transfer through the intermembrane, lowered encapsulation efficacy, bad stability, and a shorter shelf life. Targeted drug delivery, enhanced physical stability, and a favorable drug excretion profile have all been made possible by LNPs [92]. In 2012, Bernardi and co-investigator developed lipid-core nanocapsules loaded with indomethacin (IndOH-LNCs) and then examined their capacity to protect cells from neuroinflammation and A\u03b21-42-induced cell damage. They discovered that IndOH-LNCs reduced A-induced cell death and suppressed A\u03b21-42-induced neuroinflammation in organotypic hippocampus preparations. They also discovered that IndOH-LNC treatment enhanced interleukin-10 production while lowering c-Jun N-terminal kinase phosphorylation [93].",

As a result, LNPs show a very low systemic toxicity and stabilize as well as protect the payload drug from biodegradation, while exhibited a controlled and sustained drug release profile [197,198]. \n\nLipid NPs are oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions comprised of lipid core surrounded by a shell or corona of water molecules stabilized with  [194] with permission from Elsevier. amphiphilic surfactant. Hence, Lipid NPs are able to transport both lipophilic and hydrophilic drug molecules. Lipid might be easily transformed from liquid to solid state in various structures and dispersed in water solution at body or room temperature [199]. So, LNPs are the spherical vesicles of ionized lipids dispersed in aqueous dispersion and exhibited positive charge at the normal pH with a particle size from 40 to 1000 nm. LNPs can be categorized into two sub classes: solid lipid NPs as well as nanostructured lipid carriers (Fig. 7) [200].",

            "text": "There has been considerable interest in developing nanoparticles as effective drug delivery devices over the past few decades. Nanoparticles, generally, range from 10nm to 1000nm in diameter. Nanoparticles were first developed in 1970. They were actually devised as carriers for vaccines and anticancer drugs. The focus on developing means to target the tumors and also reduce the uptake of nanoparticles by the reticuloendothelial system was the first step in this direction 5 . \n\nPolymers from natural and synthetic sources have been used. Polymer based systems in the submicron range include water soluble polymer-drug conjugates, polymer nanocapusles and nanospheres. An advantage with these systems is the vast range of chemical modifications possible. The main problem, nevertheless, encountered with these systems is possible organic residues during the production process and the polymer cytotoxicity. Polymer hydrolysis during storage has to be taken into account and lyophilization is often required to prevent polymer degradation 6 . Since the beginning of the nineties attention from various research groups has focused on an alternative to polymeric nanoparticles, the solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN). The use of solid lipids as a matrix material for drug delivery is wellknown from lipid pellets for oral drug delivery (e.g., Mucosolvan \u00ae retard capsules). Basically, lipids can be used which are well tolerated by the body (e.g., glycerides composed of fatty acids which are present in the emulsions for parenteral nutrition). Large scale production can be performed in a cost-effective and relatively simple way using high pressure homogenization leading to SLN 3,7 . \n\nA clear advantage of SLNs is the fact that the lipid matrix is made from physiological lipids which decrease the danger of acute and chronic toxicity. Also the possibility of control drug release and drug targeting with the higher drug pay load and feasibility for sterilization are some of the major advantages with these systems.",

            "text": "Based on the advantages of the aforementioned LNP types, nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) with cores hybridized with liquid and solid lipids have been developed to improve the lipophilic drug delivery efficiency (Figure 1) [60]. NLCs are formed by adding liquid lipids to the high-temperature organic phase during the manufacturing process of SLNs, with oil plots composed of liquid lipids collected inside the solid core during the emulsification process. The formed oil plot induces an increased number of defects in the core-solid matrix, which improves the capture rate by promoting drug inflow into the interior while maintaining the physical stability of the LNCs and preventing drug leakage from the solid lipid-core LNP crystallization [61]. The drug-loading capacity of NLCs can be increased by combining solid and liquid lipids with various properties. Owing to these advantages, NLCs have attracted attention as a DDS (Table 1); however, some unresolved challenges remain. NLCs are synthesized using several lipids; therefore, quality challenges, such as sterilization stability and polymorphic changes in the lipids, may occur [103]. Cytotoxicity due to the nature and concentration of some lipids and surfactants (such as hydrophobic surfactants) used in NLCs synthesis may occur [26]. In addition, the synthesis of NLCs is similar to that of SLNs and thus it was initially considered that NLCs could be used only for delivering heat-stable drugs. However, Gainza et al. [104] modified the synthesis and revealed that NLCs could also be used to deliver heat-sensitive drugs (such as proteins).",

To solve this issue, various nanoparticulate delivery systems have been developed [63][64][65][66]. Among these nanocarriers, polymeric nanoparticles and liposomes are two important nanocarriers for drug delivery applications. Polymeric nanoparticles are composed of biodegradable or biocompatible polymer(s) with stabilizers and possess extensive abilities for entrapment, encapsulation, or conjugation of therapeutic molecules. Whereas liposomes are spherical nanovesicles composed of lipid bilayers of natural or synthetic phospholipids, home to several approved therapeutics. These two nanoplatforms have the ability to enhance the efficacy of therapeutic agents through prolonged circulation half-life, sustained release, and targeted delivery of agents. A number of US Food and Drug Administration approved agents based on polymer and liposomes have been in clinical use and many more are under various stages of clinical development. Liposomes are highly biocompatible but less stable systemically, while polymeric nanoparticles exhibit superior stability but relatively less biocompatible material. \n\nPolymeric nanoparticles are often synthesized by biocompatible polymers and are known to deliver cargos in a sustained manner. One of the biggest advantages of polymeric nanoparticles is, they provide a variety of cargo loading including drugs, nucleic acids, proteins/antibodies, and peptides in order to obtain the targeted therapy [67]. Despite having these many advantages, polymeric nanoparticles have various limitations too such as toxicity of preparation solvents and degradation byproducts, biphasic drug release, batch to batch reproducibility, and large-scale production [68]. On the other hand, due to the presence of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic sites, liposomes allow to load a variety of hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs and dyes [69]. The average size range for liposomes is 100-250 nm [70]. Liposomes offer enhanced half-life, biodistribution and permeability [71].",

RNAi-lipid-based nanocarriers are able to provide security against serum nucleases enabling prolonged circulation, leading to a greater uptake by the target tissue [33]. Lipid nanocarrier's enormous advantages are their excellent biodegradability and biocompatibility. Likewise, most LNPs exhibit bearable toxicity and low immunogenicity [34]. In many previous anticancer immunotherapeutic methods, lipid-based nanovectors have empowered the integration of mRNA-based science, such as monoclonal antibodies, Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) cell therapy, and therapeutic vaccines [35]. Developing the LNPs delivery method has enabled the scientific translation and approval of the first siRNA drug to inhibit pathogenic protein manufacturing in hepatocytes [36]. Some LNPs and polymer NPs are potentially toxic at high doses, and usually have low delivery effectiveness than other systems with higher stability and appreciable surface area [37,38]. Kaczmarek et al. developed hybrid polymerlipid nanoformulations to act as a nanocarrier for functional delivery of the mRNA in HeLa cells (cervical cancer cells), as well as to the primary mouse lung cells. Importantly, these data demonstrated an association between serum stability and in vivo efficacy [39]. NPs mediated gene transfection was efficient [40].",

Examples are recent COVID-19 vaccines from both Pfizer's and Modena's contain mRNA wrapped in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) that support carrying it to human cells nevertheless also act as an adjuvant, a vaccine ingredient that bolsters the immune response [80]. The nanoparticles are <100 nm in size, and a wide range of drugs, including hydrophilic and hydrophobic small drugs, flavonoids, vaccines and biological molecules, can be delivered by these NPs [81][82][83]. Application of NPs in drug delivery can be mentioned in diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular and Alzheimer's disease [84]. The NPs help improve several features to attain improved bioavailability, as shown in Fig . 3 [85]. \n\nAP acts well in pharmacological aspect, but due to its poor solubility, its clinical application has been limited. Therefore, new formulations or methods should be developed to improve solubility of AP and its bioavailability [86]. Numerous kinds of nanomaterials such as metallic-based nanomaterials, lipid-based and polymeric nanoparticles were developed in order to the highly effective delivery of AP [86][87][88]. The oral bioavailability of AP nanoparticles was about 5 fold upper compared to the naked AP, and this formulation shows no toxic outcome on the organs of mice [89]. Various studies have revealed that solid dispersion (SD) can be effectively applied in order to the improving the dissolution level of poorly water-soluble drugs [90]. Metallic nanoparticles and carbon-based nanomaterials have been broadly applied as drug delivery systems, predominantly in targeted therapy [91]. Lipid-based nanocarriers are applied to progress the high-efficiency delivery and bioavailability of AP. Furthermore, the appliances of lipid-based nanoparticles to overcome the MDR have been proposed based on improved permeability of membrane [92,93].",

            "text": "In addition, the cytotoxicity of cationic lipids can not be ignored. To solve this problem, researchers design lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles with better colloidal stability via the combination of a polymeric core and a cationic lipid shell layer [20]. Jansen et al. fabricated lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles (LNPs) composed of DOTAP (1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium propane) and PLGA (poly (DLlactic-co-glycolic acid) containing siRNA against TNF-\u03b1 to reduce the chronic inflammatory conditions of RA. In addition to great TNF-\u03b1 silencing efficiency, LNPs showed better stability than reference lipidoid-based stable nucleic acid particles (SNALPs) [20]. Moreover, the addition of PLGA may provide the nanoparticles with the ability to release cargo in a sustained way due to the outstanding controllable and alterable degradation profile of PLGA particles [34]. Song et al. designed a lipidoid-polymer hybrid nanoparticle composed of Pluronic F127 and spermidine-based lipidoid (S14) to deliver siRNA against IL-1\u03b2 efficiently. The carriers could lower the expression of IL-1\u03b2 and effectively attenuate the inflammatory symptoms of arthritis induced by collagen antibody (Figure 1) [21]. Compared with other kinds of nanomaterials, lipid-based nanoparticles possess many unique advantages, including high delivery efficiency, low immunogenicity, good biocompatibility and versatility. However, the limitations, such as low stability, short half-time and toxicity at high concentrations, can not be ignored. Lipid-based nanoparticles have shown promise in preclinical studies and are currently being used in clinical trials for gene therapy. Researchers are working to optimize their stability, delivery efficiency and safety profile to make them more effective in treating diseases. Advancements in nanotechnology and lipid chemistry are expected to lead to the development of more sophisticated lipid-based nanoparticles that can deliver nucleic acids for RA gene therapy with even greater precision and efficiency.",

Among them, lipid-based materials are particularly favored due to their advantages of easy availability, large-scale production capability, and good safety profile. Additionally, the clinical translation of nanoparticles will be greatly limited by the requirement for excessive additional materials or more complex manufacturing processes to achieve the ideal surface and holistic properties (such as charge, hydrophilicity, particle size, and rigidity). Therefore, it is crucial to take into account the design of The hard NPs with higher rigidity tended to be transported through exocytosis-related pathways such as the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, microtubules, and caveolae, thus showing higher exocytosis efficiency 174",

Lipids are sometimes defined as aquaphobic or amphipathic small molecules; the amphiphilic characteristic of certain lipids enables us to build formations in an aqueous environment like vesicle, large uniflagellar liposomes, or membrane. Biological lipid is made up of two types of biochemical subunits or \"building blocks\": ketoacyl and isoprene groups.

They have little oral absorption due to their highly hydrophobic nature [15]. As a consequence, the desire to extend the range of applications for such carriers was unsatisfactory, and they're not employed in propulsion systems till 1900, while they were encased into colloidal delivery systems [16,17,18,19]. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) were seen to be better beneficial than polymeric nanoparticles in the creation of nanoparticle-based delivery systems, and they've been widely employed for drug delivery [20]. Because LNPs are made from physiologic and/or biodegradable lipids, these lipid-based carrier systems are also referred to as \"Nano safe\" carriers [21].

            "text": "Initially, viral vectors were utilized for nucleic acid delivery. However, their potential immunogenicity and safety concerns have posed insurmountable challenges, leading to a gradual shift towards synthetic nanocarriers. Recently, polymers have been one of the pioneering nanomaterials employed for the delivery of nucleic acids. Although polymers possess the advantages of easy synthesis and variable chemical structures, they often face restrictions in terms of biodegradability [251,252]. Undoubtedly, the most successful nucleic acid carriers in the current stage are LNPs. A growing body of studies has confirmed that LNPs have been the most advanced nucleic acid delivery systems to date. They have gained extensive usage, including two approved mRNA vaccines on the market against SARS-CoV-2. Nevertheless, conventional LNPs are difficult to specifically target extrahepatic organs [55]. So far, the focus has shifted to designing delivery systems that can effectively deliver therapeutic agents to targeted tissues and cells [253]. Researchers have found that the tissue selectivity of nanoparticles is closely related to factors such as the surface charge of lipid fractions. Although cationic lipidbased LNPs consisting of cations, such as DOTAP, have achieved pulmonary delivery of nucleic acids to a certain extent, there are still some potential safety hazards associated with the unavoidable cytotoxicity of positively charged substances in vivo [251]. The emergence of ionizable lipids, which carry a positive charge only in a specific physiological environment, avoids the toxicity of cationic lipids and brings superior transfection efficiency [38,222,[254][255][256][257][258]. Currently, most lung-targeted nucleic acid products that have entered the clinical research stage have been developed based on ionizable lipids, including MRT5005 \u00ae RCT1100 \u00ae . Recent studies have explored new approaches, such as attaching peptides or antibodies on the surface of nanoparticles, to achieve active targeting. The researchers have investigated the properties of materials that influence delivery efficacy and intend to provide solutions to overcome the limitations of existing materials [259].",

Furthermore, nanomaterials have the ability to improve the intravenous delivery of medications and optimize drug stability in order to reduce deterioration (Kumar et al., 2017). various nano-carriers are used for the purpose of delivering drugs. lipid-based nano-carriers are typically spherical structures consisting of a lipid bilayer that encloses an aqueous phase. these nanocarriers include liposomes, lipid nanoparticles, and emulsions. examples of polymeric nano-carriers are dendrimers and polymer micelles. inorganic nanoparticles containing metals can serve as nanocarriers for medication DDS owing to their specific use and compatibility with imaging in medicine (Mitchell et al., 2021). For the aim of developing intracellular drug DDS, nano-carriers can be manufactured in a modular form utilizing a wide variety of materials, each of which can be produced in a variety of shapes and sizes. \n\nRecently, there have been a growing number of nanotherapeutic medications that have been made available for sale or have reached the clinical testing phase. the inaugural phase i clinical trial employing a nanomaterials-based technology with targeted delivery of siRNA to individuals with solid tumors was executed in 2010 (Davis et al., 2010). A clinical research found that an actively directed polymeric nanoparticle, that contained chemotherapy drug docetaxel (DtXl), demonstrated a more effective treatment of tumors when compared to a solvent based DtXl formulation (Song et al., 2016). the introduction of hybrid NPs has further enhanced the advancement in the field of nanoparticle-based medication DDS. Hybrid nanoparticles amalgamate the characteristics of diverse nanoparticles, hence augmenting the efficacy and durability of drug-DDS (Mottaghitalab et al., 2019).",

Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs, Figure 2) are made of solid fats and surfactants to form a spherical nanoparticle with a solid lipid core and a monolayer shell [33,34]. They exhibit greater encapsulation efficiency for hydrophobic drugs than liposomes since they lack an aqueous core. This rigid core also improved the stability of SLNs compared to liposomes and polymeric nanoparticles. Indeed, SLNs in aqueous media could be stored for at least 3 years [35]. The production of SLNs does not require organic solvents, which eliminates the risk of toxicity caused by solvent residues. Additionally, the large-scale production and excellent reproducibility of SLNs are important properties for downstream commercial and clinical applications [29].",

Nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems offer significant advantages over traditional drugs, such as increasing drug solubility and stability, achieving controlled drug release, and overcoming biological barriers (Cui et al., 2016). The major classes of materials used to construct nanoparticles include lipid, polymers and inorganic materials (Ju et al., 2022). \n\nLipid nanoparticles (LNanoparticles), with a liposome-like structure, are widely used for the delivery of drugs (Mitchell et al., 2021;Eygeris et al., 2022). Nanoparticles can achieve drug loading in different ways including post-loading, co-loading, and pre-loading (Figure 6) (Liu et al., 2020). The efficacy of LNanoparticles for drug delivery, together with their simple synthesis, small size and serum stability, allow LNanoparticles to play an important role in personalized gene therapy, and in the penetration of the blood-brain barrier (Berraondo et al., 2019;Cheng et al., 2020;Hou et al., 2021). \n\nPolymeric nanoparticles can be formed from natural or synthetic materials and monomeric or pre-polymeric polymers to effectively deliver a wide range of drugs, including hydrophobic and hydrophilic compounds, and carriers of varying molecular weights, allowing the precise control of the loading efficiency and release kinetics of these therapeutic agents by modulating properties such as composition, stability, reactivity, and surface charge (Caldorera-Moore et al., 2019;Knight et al., 2019;Zhang et al., 2020). PLGA has been approved by the FDA for its excellent biosafety, biodegradability and versatility, and is considered to be one of the most successful polymers in the biomedical field (Ulery et al., 2011;Martins et al., 2018;Niza et al., 2021).",

Their biochemical properties as \u2018green\u2019 materials and biochemical processes as \u2018green\u2019 processes mean they can be environmentally sustainable. Generally, lipid nanoparticles can be employed as carriers for both lipophilic and hydrophilic drugs. The proposed administration route for nanoparticles can present advantages and disadvantages which should be considered by a formulator. Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) are attractive delivery systems because of their ease of manufacture, biocompatibility, biodegradability, and scale-up capacity of formulation constituents. The easy and simple scalability of novel SLNs and nano lipid carriers, along with their various processing procedures, recent developments, limitation and toxicity, formulation optimization and approaches for the manufacture of lipid nanoparticles, lyophilization and drug release are comprehensively discussed in this review. This review also summarizes the research data related to the various preparation methods and excipients used for SLNs and NLCs in recent years.",

            "text": "Lipid-based drug delivery systems are the most widely used and marketed systems that include a whole range of carrier types. The most advanced liposomes are large amphiphilic vesicles with a lipid bilayer having both a polar aqueous core and an unpolar surrounding lipid bilayer. More complex lipid nanoparticles such as solid lipid nanoparticles, nanostructured lipid carriers and electrostatic cationic lipid-nucleic acid lipoplexes have a more complex structure and enhanced properties in stability compared to liposomes [50][51][52][53]. Originally, LNPs were developed as vehicles for DNA-based drugs. Over time, they have proven to be reliable delivery systems for siRNA, as they are also able to entrap siRNA and thus protect the siRNA from degradation. The lipid matrix of the majority of siRNA LNPs is composed of cationic or ionizable lipids, neutral helper lipids, cholesterol and shielding lipids [54]. \n\nCationic lipids such as DOTAP [55], DOTMA [56] or DMAPAP [57] can electrostatically form stable complexes with the negative siRNA due to electrostatic interactions, thereby enabling the capturing of siRNA in the LNP. However, the net cationic lipid systems suffer from the so called \"polycationic dilemma\", as a high number of cationic charges favour the formation of complexes, but vice versa suffer from cytotoxic effects due to unspecific interactions with negatively charged cell membranes and blood components [58]. In that regard, research about pH-sensitive ionizable lipids was intensified [59]. Ionizable lipids such as DLin-DMA, DODAP or DLin-MC3-DMA offer a key advantage during the production of LNPs, because their charge can be varied [55]. They can be positively or neutrally charged depending on the pH value of the medium and allow reliable electrostatic complexation with siRNA, resulting in efficient encapsulation during manufacturing. This ability to change the charge at different pH values reduces the toxicity of ionizable lipids [60].",

Conventional batch-mode mixing methods rely on the homogenization of the particle size through sonication and extrusion [21]. However, mass production using these methods is difficult, and high batch-to-batch variability is a drawback. In particular, low yields and complex processes have made the clinical transition of LNPs difficult. In contrast, microfluidic production techniques have the advantage of producing homogeneously sized nanoparticles via a simple process, and large quantities of these nanoparticles can be easily produced [20]. The size of the nanoparticles can also be effectively controlled using microfluidic devices [22]. siRNA-loaded LNPs smaller than 50 nm that are capable of tumor penetration have been prepared using this technique [20]. \n\nThe first approved siRNA-loaded LNPs (Onpattro) demonstrated the potential of LNP production using a microfluidic-based ethanol injection method for medicinal applications [22]. The mRNA vaccines recently launched by Moderna and Pfizer are lipid nanoparticle formulations produced using microfluidic processes. In vaccine development, Lipid-based nanoparticles offer a diverse range of options for drug delivery. Each type exhibits unique properties that can be tailored to meet the specific requirements of the therapeutic cargo. Factors such as the nature of the cargo, desired release kinetics, and the targeted delivery site play crucial roles in selecting the appropriate lipid-based nanoparticles. Ongoing research and development in this field hold immense promise for advancing drug delivery strategies and improving therapeutic outcomes. \n\nRecently, LNPs have been actively investigated for the delivery of RNA-based biopharmaceuticals [11,12]. Although non-viral vectors such as LNP have lower efficiency than viral vectors, the former are biosafe and have the advantage of being able to carry large mRNA sequences [13,14].",

            "text": "The structural combination of a polymer hydrogel network and a nanoparticle (e.g., metals, nonmetals, metal oxides, and polymeric moieties) possesses the capability of providing superior functionality to the composite material. It has been demonstrated that this combination has practical applications in various fields such as catalysis, electronics, bio-sensing, drug delivery and environmental remediation. Furthermore, the hybridization of the two compounds may enhance the synergistic properties of each component. For instance, the mechanical strength of the hydrogel could simultaneously decrease the nanoparticle's aggregation, making it more stable and more efficient. As a result of these mutual benefits and the associated potential applications, multidisciplinary research groups have shown a surge of interest in the last decade [1]. Because of their differences in properties when compared to bulk materials, nanoparticles are now widely being used in everyday consumer products and appliances. This trend has sparked public debate about the safety of nanoparticle technology, and regulatory authorities in several countries have stepped in on this issue [2]. The advantages of a nanoscale drug delivery system are numerous and include a targeted delivery method that allows for enhanced drug concentration at the intended place while decreasing systemic exposure to a potentially toxic chemical. In addition, a nanoscale drug delivery system offers a consistent rate of drug administration and an improvement in drug stability owing to drug degradation and loss prevention [3]. \n\nLipidic drug delivery systems have gained attention in recent decades due to their biocompatibility as well as their ability to permeate challenging physiological barriers, particularly the blood-brain barrier (BBB), due to their lipophilicity, even without surface modifications. Additionally, the simplicity of preparation, cost-effectiveness, and practicality of large-scale manufacturing make these delivery methods more appealing [4]. \n\nLipid carriers can be categorized into various types depending on their method of preparation and physicochemical characteristics. They include liposomes, niosomes, solid lipid nanoparticles and nanostructured lipid carriers. \n\nCurrently, a variety of nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) formulations have been approved because they not only demonstrated enhanced loading efficiencies but also improved stability and prevented drug ejection during storage.",

            "text": "Nanotechnology is revolutionising research and development in healthcare. Currently, the most advanced clinical grade nanotechnologies in cancer are LNPs. Unfortunately there remains scepticism from the big pharma industry and from clinicians themselves regarding the efficacy and safety of such nanoparticle technologies. Such scepticism will only be solved with the advent of reliable cGMP-grade manufacturing processes and reliable preclinical ADME/toxicology data, followed by a range of successful first-in-man studies. While these data are being acquired, nanoparticle technologies continue to be innovated in the laboratory. The ultimate push will be for targeted trig-anostic  drug  -ABCD nanoparticles (targeted  T  NPs) that are enabled for targeted delivery then triggered release of  active therapeutic agents (or drug entities), all monitored by simultaneous, real-time diagnostic imaging using  different imaging agent probes integrated into the nanoparticle. Of the latter, both NIR and 19 F-NMR spectroscopy probes [80] could have real clinical potential alongside MRI. Such multiplicity of functions offers the very real opportunity for highly personalized drug nanoparticles assembly from selected tool-kits of chemical components, highly refined for specific, personalized delivery applications. As this vision begins to take shape, so we will be looking on a very different world of innovative, interactive healthcare products with vastly more potential to treat and even to cure cancer than has ever been seen before. Inevitably, words of balance and caution need to be expressed as well. This review has focused on LNPs and particularly on those that conform to the ABCD nanoparticle structural paradigm. There is plenty enough good reason for this focus given prospects for LNPs that conform to this paradigm in vivo, in pre-clinical studies and even in clinic. However, nanoparticles now come in many shapes and sizes ranging from polymer-based nanoparticles (PNPs) to hard, inorganic nanoparticle structures, such as the highly novel and advanced targeted 2 T 2 NP system mentioned above. However, in general, although many such systems are showing promise in vivo, few PNPs or inorganic nanoparticle structures have advanced significantly towards clinical applications.",

            "text": "Polymeric nanoparticles have many disadvantages like cytotoxicity of the polymers after internalization in to the cell as well as its difficulty in large scale production which leads to the use of physiological lipids or lipids as drug carriers. Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), nanostructure lipid carriers (NLC) and lipid drug conjugates (LDC) are innovative carrier systems which overcome the above associated problems as well. \n\nThe SLNs are sub-micron colloidal carriers which are composed of physiological lipid, dispersed in water or in an aqueous surfactant solution. Advantages of SLN are the use of physiological lipids, the avoidance of organic solvents, a potential wide application spectrum (dermal, per oral, intravenous) and the high pressure homogenization as an established production method 67 . Potential disadvantages such as poor drug loading capacity, their particle growing, unpredictable gelation tendency, drug expulsion after polymeric transition during storage and relatively high water content of the dispersions (70-99.9%) have been observed [68][69] . \n\nNano structured lipid carriers (NLC) are mixtures of solid and fluid lipids, the fluid lipid phase is reported to be embedded into the solid lipid matrix or to be localized at the surface of solid platelets and the surfactant layer 70 . NLC system minimizes or avoids the following disadvantages of SLNs like low drug loading capacity, drug expulsion during storage and high water content 71 . \n\nAnother major problem of SLN is the low capacity to load hydrophilic drugs due to partitioning effects during the production process. Thus only highly potent low dose hydrophilic drugs may be suitably incorporated in the solid lipid matrix 72 . In order to overcome this limitation, the so called lipid drug conjugate (LDC) nanoparticles with drug loading capacities of up to 33% have been developed 73 . \n\nMany applications like drugs with irritant effects like tretinoin turns out to be less irritating if applied when encapsulated within SLN 74 . Lipid nanoparticles can be used to improve the bioavailability of drugs, e.g.",

Typically, simple lipidcoated LCNHPs with either organic or inorganic core could be fabricated at a laboratory scale by using a lipid thin-\ue103lm hydration method. Various studies on LCHNPs using this method are listed in Table 1. For LCHNPs with organic nanoparticulate cores, the two main components are \ue103rst prepared separately. More speci\ue103cally, the polymeric core is usually prepared through ESE or the nanoprecipitation methods, while the lipid thin-\ue103lm is usually prepared by solvent evaporation of a lipid-containing organic solvent in a rotary evaporator. The core-shell structure is then obtained through direct hydration of the lipid thin \ue103lm within the nanoparticle dispersion (i.e. \ue103lm-rehydration method). Alternatively, it can also be prepared by fusing the preformed nanoparticles with lipid vesicles, followed by vortexing or sonication to achieve self-assembly of the lipids onto the nanoparticle surface through electrostatic or van der Waals interactions (vesicle-fusion method) (Fig. 3). The \ue103nal LCHNPs could subsequently be harvested from any excessive, non-adsorbed lipids by centrifugation. For LCHNPs with inorganic cores, coating with lipids could be achieved similarly by using the vesicle-fusion or \ue103lm-rehydration method to coat bare inorganic nanoparticles, so as to generate a symmetrical lipid bilayer on the inorganic nanoparticle surface. The co-delivery LCHNP system enabled the intravenous administration of hydrophobic drugs, and sustained released trend showed strong cytotoxic effect against breast cancer cells 61 \n\n2.1.2.

            "text": "Despite demonstrated safety and efficacy from clinical trials (Fig. 1), the rate of clinical translation of silica nanoparticles remains slow. For example, although gold shell-silica nanoparticles were developed in the 1990s, it took about two decades for this technology to advance into clinical trials. Organic nanoparticles, such as liposomes and lipid nanoparticles, have been successfully translated into clinical applications. However, compared with organic nanoparticles, silica nanoparticles have several advantages, which warrant further clinical studies; for example, by modulating their structural and physiochemical properties, such as size, charge, surface functionality and shape, silica nanoparticles can deliver drugs across biological barriers. Moreover, they can easily be hybridized with other inorganic particles, such as gold nanoparticles. Silica nanoparticles also possess self-adjuvant properties, which is desirable for the development of next-generation nanovaccines 2 . In addition, silica nanoparticles are stable in harsh biological settings, for example, in the acidic environment of the stomach, in which liposomes usually degrade, limiting their applicability in oral delivery 2 . Consequently, silica nanoparticles with good safety, efficacy and viability may be applicable in more diverse clinical scenarios than their organic counterparts.\n\nBased on their performance in clinical trials, silica nanoparticles are emerging as a promising diagnostic and delivery platform and could play a key role in the development of next-generation theranostics, nanovaccines and formulations to orally deliver peptides and proteins. However, key hurdles that remain to be C o m m e n t  overcome for silica nanoparticles' clinical translation include establishing safety from chronic exposure, establishing long-term toxicological profiles from different routes of administration, investigating reliable scale-up methods and synthesizing reproducible silica nanoparticles with minimal batch-to-batch variation. Moreover, only solid silica nanoparticles without pores or with small pores have been clinically tested thus far. These nanoparticles do not have high cargo-loading capacity, especially for nucleic-acid-based drugs. Alternatively, dendritic, virus-like, large-pore and me",

Nano-delivery systems, on the whole, could be divided into two groups: polymer-and lipid-based systems [31]. Poly-(lactic acid) or poly(lactide-co-glycolide), owing to the excellent biocompatibility, biodegradability and incorporation capability for hydrophilic drugs, have been widely used to fabricate nanoparticles [28]. Wang\uf0a0et al fabricated the SIM-loaded nanoparticles and confirmed that the NPs exhibited a cumulative release of up to 80% within 72 h and had an excellent cellular uptake capacity and showed great biocompatibility with MC3T3-E1 cells [34]. Copolymer micellar nanoparticles of SV provided control drug release profiles and could control cholesterol level in hyperlipidemic rabbits [26]. However, the number of products based on the polymer system in the market is limited owing to their potential toxicity, the need to use organic solvents and the lack of suitable methods for large-scale production [3]. Lipid nanoparticles, due to their nonuse organic solvents, negligible toxicity, sustained drug release and suitability for large-scale production and sterilization [5,12], have been considered as an alternative to traditional carriers such as polymeric liposomes and nanoparticles [13,20], especially for drugs with poor water-solubility, peptides, and genes, as well as for other applications [18,21]. Nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC), the second generation of lipid nanoparticles, have been demonstrated to load various small moleculars [21,31].",

            "text": "LNPs are typically classified into several categories, including liposomes, lipid nanoemulsions, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs), polymer-lipid hybrid nanoparticles (PLNs), and protein-lipid nanoparticles, such as synthetic high-density lipoproteins (sHDLs) [67]. Liposomes, due to their amphiphilic nature, possess both hydrophilic and lipophilic properties, allowing them to efficiently encapsulate and deliver a wide variety of substances with diverse solubility profiles. Multilamellar liposomes, in particular, can incorporate larger amounts of lipophilic molecules into their vesicle membranes, thanks to their increased surface area. Nanoemulsions, on the other hand, are created by dispersing oil droplets in an aqueous phase (o/w) or water droplets in an oil phase (w/o), with surfactants stabilizing the system, enabling the encapsulation of either lipophilic or hydrophilic drugs, respectively [68]. Polymer-lipid hybrid nanoparticles (PLNs) are composed of a lipid shell surrounding a polymer core. Protein-lipid nanoparticles, such as synthetic high-density lipoproteins (sHDLs), are structured similarly to endogenous pre-\u03b2 HDLs [69]. Typically, sHDLs consist of phospholipids and apolipoproteins or their mimetic peptides (Figure 3). In contrast to liposomes, sHDLs usually exhibit a discoidal structure, with the lipid bilayer stabilized by the protein or peptide component. As drug-free nanoparticles, sHDLs can function similarly to endogenous HDLs. Additionally, sHDLs can be utilized as drug delivery systems, as their lipid bilayer structure allows for the encapsulation of lipophilic small molecule drugs [70].",

            "text": "Various types of vectors are being developed for mRNA delivery. [1,4] Common challenges of these vectors relate to increasing translation efficiency, promoting advantageous pharmacokinetic profiles with high mRNA stability, achieving tissue and cellular selectivity, and employing simple manufacturing and storage. Viral vectors have shown outstanding properties for delivering mRNA, such as in vivo application and high translation rates. [5] However, they are limited by their maximum packing size, cytotoxicity, immunogenicity and intricate manufacturing. [6] Nonviral vectors based on biocompatible materials have potential for overcoming the drawbacks of viruses through precise engineering of their nanostructure. These nonviral carriers are mainly prepared from lipids, polymers, and their combinations. [4,7] Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are at the forefront of clinical translation, showing high delivery efficiency. mRNA formulated in LNPs can be delivered to several organs and cell types, leading to a variety of therapeutic applications, for example, vaccines for cancer and infectious diseases. [1,2,8] These advanced studies have demonstrated the safety and high translation ability of lipid carriers, but also identified limitations, such as thermostability issues that correspond with expensive cold chains and logistics, [9] and in many cases tropism to the liver. [10] hile polymer-based mRNA delivery systems are less advanced in the clinic than lipids and show certain challenges, such as relatively low transfection efficiency and potential toxicities, [11] they have potential for providing unique features, such as the assembly of various nanostructures in aqueous conditions, ability of lyophilization and long-term storage, [12] and distinct pharmacokinetics that could be useful for developing advanced mRNA therapies. However, it is important to note that precise engineering of the polymers, controlled chemical structure, and high batch-to-batch reproducibility are key features for the translation of polymer-based mRNA delivery systems into therapeutics. In this regard, not all polymer-based systems may satisfy the abovementioned properties, and thus, may not be suitable for clinical application. [13] In our work, we discussed the unique strengths, advantages, and disadvantages of polymer systems.",

            "text": "Genetic drugs have the potential to treat a variety of diseases. Recently, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have attracted much attention among drug delivery systems for genetic drugs. LNPs have been practically used in small interfering RNA (siRNA) drugs and mRNA vaccines. Although LNPs are generally prepared by mixing nucleic acids in acidic aqueous buffer and lipid excipients in alcohol (i.e., ethanol), it is not well understood which process parameters in the LNPs formation affect the physicochemical properties and the functionality of LNPs. In this study, we used siRNA-containing LNPs as a model, and evaluated the effect that aqueous solution parameters (buffering agent type, salt concentration, and pH) and mixing parameters (ratio, speed, and temperature) exert on the physicochemical properties and in vitro gene-knockdown activity of LNPs. Among such parameters, the type of buffering agent, salt concentration (ionic strength), pH in acidic aqueous buffer, as well as the mixing ratio and speed significantly affected the mean particle diameter and in vitro gene-knockdown activity of LNPs. A strong correlation between the mean particle diameters and their in vitro gene-knockdown activities was observed. These observations suggest that the process parameters influencing the mean LNPs diameter are likely to be important in the formation of LNPs and also that these correlate with in vitro gene-knockdown activity. Because LNP systems are being further developed for future clinical applications of genetic drugs, information regarding the LNPs manufacturing process is of utmost importance. The results observed in this study will be useful for the manufacturing of optimal LNPs.",

LNPs like liposomes, emulsions, nanocapsules, nanospheres, solid lipid nanoparticles, nanostructured lipid carriers, and exosomes are employed in drug delivery and the diagnosis of cancer [186,187]. LNPs are spherical nanovesicles comprised of phospholipids, cholesterol, and solid and liquid lipids, and are used to entrap hydrophobic drugs as well as hydrophilic drugs. In addition to these, they also contain surfactants and co-surfactants used to reduce the interfacial tension between two phases and form a monophasic layer. Various anticancer therapeutics have already been formulated as liposomal formulations such as lipoplatin, which is a cisplatin-loaded liposome [188]. Various studies inferred that compared to PNPs, LNPs are considered more beneficial for treatment, because the LNPs are composed of GRAS-recognized biocompatible and biodegradable lipids, making them safe for delivery [189]. was observed that the ICAM-1-targeted Lcn2-liposomes mediated a strong interaction or binding with the TNBC cells (MDA-MB-231) compared to the interaction of the noncancerous cells (MCF-10A) with the TNBC cells. Additionally, it was observed that the knockdown of Lcn2 through ICAM-1-targeted Lcn2-liposomes resulted in a significant decrease in the generation of VEGF (Figure 9), which led to decreased angiogenesis both in vitro as well as in vivo [190].

            "text": "Although non-viral vectors such as LNP have lower efficiency than viral vectors, the former are biosafe and have the advantage of being able to carry large mRNA sequences [13,14]. Furthermore, LNPs can easily fulfill three requirements for nucleic acid delivery vehicles: efficient encapsulation to resist degradation by nucleases, a mechanism for targeted delivery and intracellular entry, and a manufacturing process that allows for the mass production of uniformly sized nanoparticles [15]. The cargo content and physicochemical properties (particle size, shape, surface charge, etc.) of LNPs can be controlled by adjusting the lipid composition [16]. \n\nNanoparticles containing cationic lipids have been widely studied as carriers of genes and nucleic acids because of their ability to carry negatively charged nucleic acids and attach to the lipid bilayer of cells [17]. However, cytotoxicity due to cationic lipids and rapid elimination from the body are limitations [18]. To compensate for this, ionizable lipids that are neutral in circulation and positively charged only in endosomes have been developed and actively studied [19]. \n\nThe use of microfluidic mixing enables the fabrication of LNPs that effectively shield biopharmaceuticals [20]. Conventional batch-mode mixing methods rely on the homogenization of the particle size through sonication and extrusion [21]. However, mass production using these methods is difficult, and high batch-to-batch variability is a drawback. In particular, low yields and complex processes have made the clinical transition of LNPs difficult. In contrast, microfluidic production techniques have the advantage of producing homogeneously sized nanoparticles via a simple process, and large quantities of these nanoparticles can be easily produced [20]. The size of the nanoparticles can also be effectively controlled using microfluidic devices [22]. siRNA-loaded LNPs smaller than 50 nm that are capable of tumor penetration have been prepared using this technique [20]. \n\nThe first approved siRNA-loaded LNPs (Onpattro) demonstrated the potential of LNP production using a microfluidic-based ethanol injection method for medicinal applications [22].",

The ability of a mRNA vaccine to have a therapeutic effect is related to the capacity of LNPs to deliver the nucleic acid intact into cells. The role of LNPs is to protect mRNA, especially from degradation by ribonucleases (RNases) and to allow it to access the cytoplasm of cells where it can be translated into the protein of interest. LNPs enter cells by endocytosis and their size is a critical parameter impacting their cellular internalization. In this work, we studied different formulation process parameters impacting LNPs size. Taylor dispersion analysis (TDA) was used to determine the LNPs size and size distribution and the results were compared with those obtained by Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS). TDA was also used to study both the degradation of mRNA in the presence of RNases and the percentage of mRNA encapsulation within LNPs.",

            "text": "mRNA-based therapy holds great promise for treating infectious diseases, cancer, and inheritable diseases. The rapid development of biomaterials and nanotechnology could greatly help solve various problems such as delivery issues, limited stability, cell targeting and transfection Non-viral vectors, such as LNPs, can effectively load mRNA, improve transfection efficiency, trigger immune responses, and enhance antibody titers. This has been exemplified by mRNA vaccines for COVID-19. Further development and clinical applications of mRNA-based therapeutics can be facilitated by the use of LPX, polyplexes, LPPs, and others. However, the safety, effectiveness, and functionality of these delivery vectors need to be explored. For lipid nanoparticles, biodegradable lipid-based nanoparticles can be quickly eliminated from plasma and tissues, enhancing their safety and tolerability. Cationic lipids determine the delivery efficiency and transfection efficiency of lipid nanoparticle-mRNA formulations, and toxicity of vectors is related to cationic lipid structure. Ionizable lipids endow vectors with low toxicity stealth ability. Regulating head groups and hydrophobic tails of lipids can enhance the delivery efficiency of mRNA by increasing cellular uptake and endosomal escape of mRNA-loaded lipid nanoparticles. Adjusting lipid structures can also achieve organ-specific and cell-specific delivery of lipid nanoparticles. In the face of these challenges, naturally derived membrane lipids (such as exosomes and cell membranes) may provide another option for mRNA delivery. \n\nFor other delivery vectors, polymeric nanoparticles exhibited diversified delivery strategies owing to the versatility, tunability and scalability of polymers. Both targeted functional groups modified polymers and responsive polymers can effectively delivery mRNA in vitro and in vivo. However, as clinical vaccine candidates, polymeric nanoparticle-mRNA formulations require comprehensive safety evaluation of polymers and their degradation products, as well as reliable quality controls based on the complexity of polymer structures before entering the market. Hybrid nanoparticles, such as LPPs or CLANs, may improve mRNA delivery potency by integrating the advantages of individual components, whereas the biodegradability of components and their degradation products should be evaluated.",

They come in various types, each with specific advantages for different applications. One type is the polymer-core lipid-shell hybrid nanoparticles, which have a partial polymer core covered by a lipid shell. They can hold hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs, making them suitable for anticancer therapeutics by co-delivering drug-resistance inhibitors and chemotherapeutic drugs [186]. Another type is the core-shell hollow lipid-polymer-lipid hybrid nanoparticles, which have a hollow core with cationic lipid layers. They possess the features of both lipoplexes and PLGA nanoparticles. They can efficiently capture anionic drugs, enabling the co-delivery of negatively charged nucleic acids such as siRNAs and small drugs to overcome drug resistance. Lastly, the polymer-caged liposome hybrid nanoparticles have polymer coatings on the surface of liposomes, which enhances stability and controls the drug release profile. Despite the versatility of hybrid nanoparticles, they possess common attributes, including a polymeric core that is both hydrophobic and hydrophilic for drug encapsulation, a biocompatible lipid shell encompassing the polymeric core, and an outer component comprising a lipid-PEG that is enveloped by a lipid layer. This structural design enhances drug loading and steric stabilization, prolongs in vivo circulation time, prevents immune recognition, and enhances active targeting, thereby enabling their potential use in anticancer therapeutics [186,187]. \n\nSeveral studies have demonstrated the feasibility of using lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles for PDAC treatment. Hu et al. successfully created hybrid nanoparticles by conjugating an anti-CEA half-antibody with a lipid-polymer structure. The maleimidethiol coupling reaction was employed to attach the anti-CEA half-antibody to the lipid-PEG end.",

It was observed that nanoparticles exist in many shapes and sizes, ranging from inorganic nanoparticles to polymer-based nanoparticles. It was further observed that a few of the polymer-based nanoparticles or inorganic nanoparticles showed significant in vivo results for clinical application. Our view suggests that such nanoparticles can induce certain toxicity in humans, which is not observed in the case of lipid-based nanoparticles, and urges the evaluation of the substantial preclinical studies with utmost caution.

Thereby, these systems consist of aqueous dispersions of particles with sizes ranging from 150 to 300 nm, although higher and smaller sizes may be found (58,78). \n\nSo far, when compared to other colloidal systems (e.g. liposomes and polymeric nanoparticles), lipid nanoparticles have been described as superior carriers. This contributes to their advantages for use as drug delivery systems, such as (22,79,80): low or absence of in vivo toxicity, related to the use of generally recognized as safe (GRAS) substances; protection of the drug molecules from degradations; good long-term stability; controlled drug release effect; specific drug targeting, improving bioavailability; economic production techniques, which do not require the use of organic solvents and ease the transfer to an industrial scale. \n\nThere are two types of lipid nanoparticle systems: the solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) and the nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs). The former were first created and the latter emerged to circumvent the drawbacks pointed out of the SLNs, such as limited drug-loading capacity and drug expulsion during storage. The NLCs are also composed of a solid lipid matrix, which has blended a liquid lipid (usually up to 30%) that confers a higher capacity for drug encapsulation. Therefore, the mixture of solid with spatially incompatible liquid lipids originate a structure with more imperfect crystal lattices, which can accommodate greater amounts of molecules, increasing drug loading and preventing storage expulsion (58).",

            "text": "Complex diseases like cancer and genetic disorders often exhibit heterogeneous and dynamic characteristics within the body, making uniform drug distribution challenging 1,2 . The treatment of these diseases necessitates precise and effective drug-delivery systems with high spatiotemporal control for maximized therapeutic impact 3,4 . Up to date, delivery loaders such as hydrogels 5 , polymeric nanoparticles 6 , molecular conjugates 7 , viral vectors 8 , and lipid-based nanoparticles 9 (LBNPs) are getting widely used. Particularly, LBNPs are increasingly recognized for their ability to protect and deliver sensitive agents like mRNA to target sites, locally or systematically, while maintaining biocompatibility 9,10 . LBNPs allow targeted administration to specified diseased cells or tissues, enhancing therapeutic efficacy via controlled release mechanisms and minimizing systemic side effects. Among the diverse LBNP formulations, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are distinguished by their inclusion of ionizable lipids. They incorporate helper lipids, cholesterol, PEGylated lipids, and other functional components into their self-assembled nanoscale structure, just like other LBNPs 11,12 . Their impact has been evidenced by numerous clinical trials 13,14 and emergency use authorizations for SARS-CoV2 mRNA vaccines by Pfizer and Moderna [15][16][17] . \n\nConceptually, LNPs simulate a \"thermodynamic system\" where the mass is enclosed within confined spaces under equilibrium circumstances and released when the system is nonequilibrium. In this review, we examine the equilibrium and non-equilibrium states of LNPs as semi-closed systems at different stages of their life cycle. While existing reviews comprehensively covered aspects such as development 9 , component 18 , application 19 , and clinical aspects of LNPs 19 , our perspective further integrates structural, environmental, and functional aspects within a thermodynamically informed framework. On this basis, we introduce the Four-Domain Model, comprising the Architecture, Interface, Payload, and Dispersal Domain (Fig. 1). This modular framework fills in the gaps in the present studies by dissecting the advancement of LNPs with particular attention on each domain's programmability.",

            "text": "Nanoparticles (NPs) are materials with sizes ranging from 1 to 100 nm and are characterized with uniform size distribution, favorable surface potential, and low polydispersity index [5,6]. A variety of techniques are used to formulate nanoparticles, such as emulsification [7], nanomilling [8], and nanoprecipitation [9]. NP-based formulations have the potential to improve the stability and solubility of APIs, facilitate their transport across membranes, and prolong circulation times, thereby reducing toxicity, and enhancing bioavailability and efficacy [6,10]. \n\nThere are three main classes of nanoparticles as drug delivery systems: lipid-, polymer-, or inorganic-NPs [6]. Lipid-NPs are spherical vehicles comprised of a lipid bilayer(s) surrounding one or more internal aqueous compartments. Lipid-NP delivery systems (e.g., liposomes) have several advantages, such as self-assembly, biocom- patibility, high bioavailability, and payload flexibility [11]. Polymer-NPs are engineered using biocompatible natural or synthetic polymers, such as hyaluronic acid or poly(lacticco-glycolic acid). Inorganic-NPs are made from materials that have good biocompatibility and stability [6,12] such as gold, iron oxide, zinc oxide, silver, carbon, silica, boron, hydroxyapatite, and semiconductors [12,13]. \n\nThe design of NP-based DDSs relies on understanding the mechanisms of biological barriers to therapeutics. Previous reviews have outlined design frameworks to overcome these biological barriers [6,10,14,15]. One of those designs includes incorporating cationic polymers (e.g., poly-ethyleneimine) that effectively increases the release of APIs from NPs confined in endosomal compartments [10]. Another technique entails PEGylation, which results in evasion of mononuclear phagocytes [16][17][18].",

They are widely used in therapeutics and drug delivery because conjugating mRNA with LNPs protects it from enzymatic degradation, increasing the levels of interferon interacting genes by 15-25 folds when compared to neutral or negatively charged NPs, mediating efficient drug uptake through a sophisticated permeation mechanism, and simultaneously ensuring targeted vaccine delivery [49]. As a result, the creation of a steady, powerful, and long-lasting immune response is aided, which might better protect the host from infection. The synthetic lipids have two unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon chains that are either bonded to a quaternary amine, unlike natural lipids [50].\n\nThe LNPs-based systems utilize two cationic liposomes namely, 1,2-di-O-octadecyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (DOTMA) and 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP) for nucleic acid delivery [51]. These liposomes serve as suitable drug and nucleic acid delivery systems and are considered viable candidates not only for their utilization as nano-adjuvants in vaccines but are also currently being explored as potential candidates for drug carriers. Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna Vaccine are two of the most widely used COVID-19 vaccines which are LNP-based mRNA vaccines used all over the world [52,53].",

The emergence of mRNA-LNP has represented a significant advancement in cancer prevention, yet there is still ample scope for enhancing LNP effectiveness. This can be accomplished through the refinement of lipid composition and customizing LNPs to cater to specific objectives. Cell membrane-coated biomimetic nanoparticles have shown great potential for cancer targeted therapies due to their superior molecular identification specificity and cancer cell targeting. However, there is still a lack of key indicators that can assess the quality of these bio-inspired nanoparticles and the resulting therapeutic effects. Additionally, only a few of these nanoparticles have received clinical approval due to their toxicity, immunogenicity and reticuloendothelial system isolation. Microsphere formulations are a type of sustained-release drug delivery system that can stably release drugs over a prolonged period. They are mainly used for diseases that require frequent dosing, such as cancer and psychiatric disorders. This drug delivery system can significantly improve the bioavailability of drugs and patient compliance. However, the development and production of microsphere formulations are challenging, and there are high barriers to entry in the industry. Therefore, it is necessary to accelerate the development of corresponding technologies. There is no denying that nanotechnology will play an important role in the future of medicine, but there are many aspects of nanotechnology that are not yet perfect. For nanotechnology to benefit humanity, further exploration by relevant researchers is needed.",

            "text": "LP have some important drawbacks: they are manufactured through processes that involve organic solvents, they are unstable in biological fluids and more generally in aqueous solutions (they cannot be commercialized as such), and they present poor batch-to-batch reproducibility and difficul-ties in sterilization [311,312]. Therefore, there is a need to develop alternative nanocarriers based on lipid components. It is hoped that these drug carriers will allow higher control over drug release and delivery of therapeutics which may not efficiently load into LP. Between the variety of lipid carriers, Nanostructured Lipid Carriers (NLC) and Solid Lipid Nanoparticles (SLN) have been developed and used as parenteral drug delivery systems, especially in cancer chemotherapy [313,314]. SLN were developed in the middle of the 1990s, by replacing the liquid lipid (oil) of an oil-in-water nanoemulsion by a solid lipid or a blend of solid lipids [315]. The use of solid lipids instead of oils is a very attractive idea to achieve controlled drug release, since the drug molecule mobility in a solid matrix should be intuitively lower compared with an oily phase [118]. SLN have a diameter approximately between 50 and 1000 nm [316]. Moreover, large-scale manufacturing of SLN is possible (while other systems such as polymeric nanoparticles have faced scalingup issues), and solvent use can be avoided using highpressure homogenization with extant machinery [5,117,118]. A couple of limitations to the use of SLN come from their limited loading capacity because of the formation of a highly ordered, perfect lipid crystal matrix [317]. After preparation, at least some of the particles crystallize in higher energy modifications that, during storage, evolve to low energy, more ordered modifications that lead to drug expulsion [117]. These drawbacks have been solved by second generation lipid nanoparticles, NLC, in which the solid lipids are blended with oils.",

Interestingly, the use of nanoparticles as a drug delivery system dated back to the early 1990s. Several new generation nanoparticles with new therapeutic modalities have been developed since then. Therapeutic and diagnostic nanoparticles fall under two categories: inorganic (AgNps, AuNps, CuONps, ZnONps, TiO 2 Nps, MgONps, CaONps, Fe 2 O 3 Nps, MnO 2 Nps, etc.) and organic (liposomes, polymeric NPs, micelles, solid lipid Nps (SLNs), nanostructured   Zhao et al. (2020) lipid carriers (NLCs), nanocapsules, nanotubes, quantum dots, dendrimers, emulsions, nanogels, and vesicles). Several inorganic nanoparticles have been successful in clinical studies and have been developed in the clinic for several applications (Anselmo and Mitragotri 2015). Organic nanoparticles have frequently been used in vaccine production and as drug delivery agents. Organic nanoparticles delivered intravenously as treatments for several diseases are also available (Petros and DeSimone 2010). Organic and inorganic nanoparticles have some distinct advantages over The size greatly influences antimicrobial potential of nanoparticles. Small size particle has a larger surface areato-volume ratio. Parameters like synthesis method and reducing/stabilizing agents also affect the morphology, size and stability of the synthesized nanoparticles. Thus, controlling these parameters is a major challenge for efficient and highly effective nanoparticles synthesis. Nanoparticles often used as antimicrobial agents usually ranges from 1 to 100 nm. However, particle size range from 10 \u00b5m to 10 nm are often more effective because they can easily penetrate and interact with cells. However, synthesizing nanoparticle with such size is often an issue 2\n\nShape Nanoparticles are often synthesized in different shapes. AgNps for example have different shapes such as spherical, triangular or pyramid, nanorods, nanowires, flower shaped, octahedral, tetrahedral, nano-prism and nano",

Among these, lipid nanoparticles (LNP) have specifically come up for dermal, transdermal, mucosal, intramuscular and ocular drug administration routes in the last twenty years. However, for some of them (especially dermal, transdermal, mucosal), the LNP aqueous dispersions display unsuitable rheological properties. They therefore need to be processed as semi-solid formulations such as LNP-hydrogel composites to turn into versatile drug delivery systems able to provide precise spatial and temporal control of active ingredient release. In the present review, recent developments in the formulation of lipid nanoparticle-hydrogel composites are highlighted, including examples of successful encapsulation and release of lipophilic drugs through the skin, the eyes and by intramuscular injections. In relation to lipid nanoparticles, a specific emphasis has been put on the LNP key properties and how they influence their inclusion in the hydrogel. Polymer matrices include synthetic polymers such as poly(acrylic acid)-based materials, environment responsive (especially thermo-sensitive) polymers, and innovative polysaccharide-based hydrogels. The composite materials constitute smart, tunable drug delivery systems with a wide range of features, suitable for dermal, transdermal, and intramuscular controlled drug release.",

            "text": "LNPs seem to be promising vehicles across pharmaceutical industries to deliver mRNA and other therapeutics. As a milestone in mRNA-based intervention, LNPs-mRNA vaccines were successfully tried for the first time against COVID-19. 110 LNPs were the key in developing the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine for effective protection and transportation. Liposome, an early LNPs version, is a versatile nanomedicine delivery platform (Figure 4). Lipid nanoparticles are successfully used as an mRNA delivery system. Many liposomal drugs are approved and are in use in medical practice. \n\nAn enhanced physical stability with a more complex architecture was exhibited in subsequent lipid-nanocarrier innovations in the form of a nanostructured lipid carrier, cationic lipid-nucleic acid complex, and solid-lipid NP. LNPs hold great promise in treating an array of diseases due to their encapsulation and site-specific delivery ability and sustained release of contents. 111 The delivery of polymeric particles encapsulated nucleic acids and the delivery of exogenous mRNA into a host cell with liposome were successfully demonstrated long ago, in 1976 112 and 1978 113 respectively. \n\nCationic lipids are commonly used in formulating mRNAbased vaccines. The headgroup in cationic lipids has a permanent positive charge. 114 \u2212117 Spleen-targeted DOTMA\u2212mRNA lipoplexes are developed as systemic cancer vaccines. 118 Antigen-specific CD4 regulatory T cells proliferate by such vaccines that lead to superior immunosuppression with reduced clinical signs. 119 \u2212123 Dimethyldioctadecylammonium bromide (DDAB), a quaternary NH 4 \n\n+ lipid as an mRNA vaccine adjuvant, forms mRNA complexes that stimulate innate immunity. 124 Biodegradable lipids are more and more being accepted in the vaccine world. It helps the rapid elimination of lipid NPs from tissue and plasma through which their safety and tolerability are improved. COVID-19 mRNA (mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2) vaccines involving biodegradable lipids have widespread acceptance. \u2212127 Other than being used for vaccines against infectious diseases, mRNA vaccines have a promising future, including their use in cancer.",

            "text": "Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) are generally known as lipid nanoparticles (LNPs).SLNs are lipid-based nanoparticles. They are an innovative pharmaceutical drug delivery method as well as a new pharmaceutical formulation (1). \n\nSolid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) were first introduced in 1991 as an alternative to traditional colloidal carriers like emulsions, liposomes, and polymeric micro and nanoparticles. As an alternate particulate carrier system, nanoparticles produced from solid lipids are getting a lot of attention as a new colloidal drug carrier for intravenous applications. \n\nSLNs are sub-micron colloidal carriers with diameters ranging from 50 to 1000 nm, made up of physiological lipid and dispersed in water or an aqueous surfactant solution. SLN are appealing for their potential to increase pharmaceutical efficacy due to their unique qualities such as tiny size, vast surface area, high drug loading, and phase interaction at the interface. \n\nSolid lipid nanoparticles are an innovative possible colloidal carrier system as an alternative to polymers that is identical to oil in water emulsion. The liquid lipid has been replaced with a solid lipid. \n\nSolid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) have been considered the most effective lipid-based colloidal carriers. This is one of the most used methods for increasing the oral bioavailability of medicines that are poorly water soluble. SLNs are made up of physiologically acceptable lipid components that are solid at room temperature and are in the submicron size range of 50-1000 nm. All of the benefits of polymeric nanoparticles, fat emulsions, and liposomes are combined in SLNs. \n\nSLNs have many benefits, including superior biocompatibility, minimal toxicity, and improved delivery of lipophilic medicines via solid lipid nanoparticles, as well as a physically stable system (2). \n\nSolid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) have a huge amount of potential in terms of achieving the goal of site-specific drug delivery.

            "text": "Among the lipid-based nanoparticles, SLNPs have been intensively developed because they combine the advantages of different carrier systems like liposomes and polymeric particles. Similarly to liposomes, SLNPs are composed of physiologically-biocompatible excipients (lipids and fatty acids). In the same way to polymeric NPs, their solid matrix core can efficiently protect the loaded active pharmaceutical ingredient against chemical degradation under the harsh conditions of biological milieux. Therefore, SLNPs provide controlled release profiles of the encapsulated drugs [95]. \n\nIn addition to the above advantages, liposomes can encapsulate and transport both lipophilic and hydrophilic drugs. They have a high degree of similarity to cell membranes in terms of lipid composition and organization, which facilitates the bioavailability of the pharmaceutical compounds [102]. Liquid crystalline nanocarriers (LCN) such as cubosomes and hexosomes (Figure 3) involve multiple compartments for encapsulation of either lipophilic or hydrophilic drugs. They display structural advantages which enable high encapsulation efficacy for molecules of various sizes and hydrophilicity [113,116]. LCNs are formed by self-assembly of lyotropic lipids such as unsaturated monoglycerides, phospholipids, glycolipids, and other amphiphilic molecules. For example, monoolein, which is a nontoxic, biodegradable, and biocompatible lipid, is classified as a GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe), and \u03c9-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) have been shown to be highly beneficial in various disease models of neurodegeneration [123,124]. \n\nIn the following section, we summarize recently reported works on curcumin delivery to in vitro and in vivo models of neurodegenerative diseases. Lipid-based nanoparticles have the advantage of being the least toxic carriers for in vivo applications. The lipids used to prepare biocompatible and biodegradable nanoparticles are usually naturally-occurring molecules with low acute and chronic toxicity.",

            "text": "Beyond light delivery approaches, another way to maximize the therapeutic effect is to deliver the PS in a nanoparticle formulation, with or without active targeting, in so-called third-generation agents (Huang et al., 2012). These PDT nanoparticles aim to overcome biocompatibility issues with free PS, improve the kinetics and distribution characteristics and/or enable multimodal therapy. These issues can be particularly important with newer organic or inorganic PS constructs in order to trade biocompatibility and efficacy (Shim et al., 2022). Although some advantages can be achieved through conjugation of standard molecular PSs with antibodies, folate moieties or other small molecules, the majority of third-generation PDT approaches use nanoparticle systems (Dinakaran et al., 2023). \n\nFor nanoparticle-based PDT, the predominant constructs are with lipid nanoparticles (LNP) and their derivatives. LNPs here refer to a family of lipid-based nanoparticles such as micellar structures (single layer phospholipid with hydrophobic interior), liposomes (bi-layer phospholipids with physiologic interior environment), solid LNPs (admixture of lipids along with payload) and similar carriers. These are an attractive carrier system for PS because of the extensive research that has made them stable, biocompatible, have favorable distribution properties and drug release kinetics, provide passive targeting through the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect or allow active targeting via aptamers, allow simultaneous co-delivery of other cancer drugs, and make even natively toxic drugs feasible to use in humans (Avci et al., 2014;Dinakaran et al., 2023). Beyond this obvious advantage, further development of LNP-based PDT agents has resulted in some new strategies in leveraging nanoparticles for PDT.",

LNPs are synthesized by self-assembly of an ionizable cationic lipid and due to their similar size to viruses (80-200 nm), they can efficiently deliver mRNA into the cytoplasm [105,106]. Modifications of these nanoparticles with cholesterol or PEG, different LNPs can be developed. It is worth to mention that cholesterol and the PEG-lipid composition could increase stability and half-life of the formulation, respectively. By entry of the LNPs-mRNA vaccine complex into the cell through endocytosis mechanism, endosomal escape is facilitated due to the presence of lipid in composition of LNPs and then it releases mRNA into the cytoplasm, where the mRNA is translated into antigenic proteins that stimulate the immune system which results in the formation of neutralizing antibodies [107][108][109]. In addition to LNPs, several nanoparticles have been utilized as propitious vehicles for mRNA delivery, such as cationic polymer nanoparticles, polyethyleneimine, oil-inwater (O/W) cationic nanoemulsion and PEG-lipid functionalized dendrimer nanoparticles [103,110].",

            "text": "Numerous drugs have emerged to treat various diseases, such as COVID-19, cancer, and protect human health. Approximately 40% of them are lipophilic and are used for treating diseases through various delivery routes, including skin absorption, oral administration, and injection. However, as lipophilic drugs have a low solubility in the human body, drug delivery systems (DDSs) are being actively developed to increase drug bioavailability. Liposomes, micro-sponges, and polymer-based nanoparticles have been proposed as DDS carriers for lipophilic drugs. However, their instability, cytotoxicity, and lack of targeting ability limit their commercialization. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have fewer side effects, excellent biocompatibility, and high physical stability. LNPs are considered efficient vehicles of lipophilic drugs owing to their lipid-based internal structure. In addition, recent LNP studies suggest that the bioavailability of LNP can be increased through surface modifications, such as PEGylation, chitosan, and surfactant protein coating. Thus, their combinations have an abundant utilization potential in the fields of DDSs for carrying lipophilic drugs. In this review, the functions and efficiencies of various types of LNPs and surface modifications developed to optimize lipophilic drug delivery are discussed.",

            "text": "Furthermore, the inherent biocompatibility and safety of LNPs allow them to evade the innate immune system and extend their circulation time [71]. This makes LNPs particularly effective for delivering nucleic acids and hydrophobic protein-based drugs with short circulation half-lives, enabling precise therapeutic gene editing with the CRISPR-Cas9 system. \n\nThe significance of LNPs, with their ability to preserve lipid physicochemical properties in aqueous environments, became apparent with the fact that many small molecule anticancer drugs have low aqueous solubility, requiring encapsulation strategies to enhance delivery [72]. Several liposome-based pharmaceutical formulations have since been approved, showcasing their versatility in encapsulating hydrophilic drugs within their aqueous core and hydrophobic drugs within their lipid bilayer [73]. However, liposome technologies face challenges such as complex manufacturing processes, scalability limitations, and restricted applications for small-molecule drugs. \n\nLNPs were developed to address these limitations. Similar to liposomes, LNPs are composed of phospholipids, cholesterol, and PEGylated lipids, but with the addition of ionizable cationic lipids. These cationic lipids facilitates electrostatic interactions with negatively charged nucleic acids, forming stable nanoparticles [74]. Unlike the bilayer structure of liposomes, LNPs can adopt diverse internal architectures influenced by their nucleic acid cargo, lipid composition, manufacturing methods, and processing conditions. Negatively charged biomolecules such as CRISPR-Cas9 plasmid DNA, mRNA, and gRNA can stably bind to LNPs via electrostatic interactions, enabling the formation of highly efficient delivery systems, as shown in Figure 3a. Due to these properties, LNPs have become the most widely used non-viral delivery system for nucleic acids, with extensive research into their therapeutic applications ongoing [75].",

They claimed that the bilayer nanoparticles of the LPP provided better mRNA encapsulation and progressive release of mRNA molecules with polymer degradation as well as excellent dendritic cell targeting for better activation of T-cell immune responses through antigen presentation [41]. Using the SW-BIC-213 delivery platform, a new COVID-19 vaccine has been developed and is currently in phase I trials [42]. Furthermore, to enhance the stability of mRNA, Jacob A. Poliskey et al. utilized a PEGylated polyacridine peptide to bind double-stranded mRNA (dsmRNA) to generate dsmRNA polyplexes that were metabolically stable in the circulation. In addition, Yoshinaga et al. complexed mRNA with derived poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(cationic) block copolymers with phenylboronic acid and polyol groups to obtain polycomposite micelles (PM) with ATP-responsive cross-linked mRNA loading in the inner core to prevent enzymatic degradation [43,44]. \n\nCompared to conventional cationic polymeric carriers, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) made with ionizable lipids have shown many advantages: good biocompatibility, high nucleic acid encapsulation and effective transfection, high tissue penetration for delivery of therapeutic agents, intelligent drug release, low off-target effects, and low cytotoxicity and immunogenicity. Hence, LNPs have become the most studied and widely used third-generation mRNA delivery system [45,46], which has greatly contributed to the development of the mRNA industry and clinical applications such as the application of LNP-assisted mRNA delivery for potent cancer immunotherapy [47]. As shown in Table 3, for nucleic acid drugs, LNPs have more advantages than other delivery systems in terms of the encapsulation effect, expression efficiency, and safety in vitro and vivo.",

            "text": "One of the situations in the treatment of disease is the administration of the right concentration of an efficacious drug to the site of action in a controlled and continuous manner. Nanoparticles are an important particulate carrier system. Nanoparticles are solid colloidal particles ranging in size from 1 to 1000 nm and are composed of macromolecular material [1]. Nanoparticles can be either polymeric or lipidic (SLNs). Industry estimates suggest that approximately 40% of lipophilic drug candidates fail due to issues of solubility and formulation stability, leading to a significant failure of research activity in advanced lipophile delivery technologies. Solid lipid nanoparticle technology is a promising new approach to lipophile drug delivery. Solid Lipid Nanoparticles (SLN) are an important advance in this area. The bio-acceptable and biodegradable properties of SLN make it less toxic than polymer nanoparticles. Their small size extends the blood circulation time, is suitable for large-scale production and the absence of burst effects makes them attractive candidates to study. \n\nSolid lipid nanoparticles, introduced in 1991, are colloid carriers for regulating drug delivery systems through the development of emulsions, liposomes, microparticle polymers, and nanoparticles, with an average particle size of between 50-1000 nm [2]. Solid lipid nanoparticles combine the advantages and disadvantages of other colloid carriers. Its advantages include allowing controlled drug release and drug targeting, high oral bioavailability, increased drug stability, enabling the combination of lipophilic and hydrophilic drugs, absence of toxicity from carriers, avoiding the use of organic solvents, and easy largescale production. \n\nHowever, solid lipid nanoparticles also have disadvantages such as they can cause drug degradation if they are made using high pressure and a gelation phenomenon can occur which describes the dispersed viscosity of solid lipid nanoparticles from low viscosity to gel-like viscosity. Solid lipid nanoparticles are prepared by homogenizing the liquid secretions of lipids and emulsifiers.",

            "text": "A nanoparticle (NP) is a particle of matter between 1 and 100 nanometres (nm) in diameter. The definition is occasionally applied to larger particles, up to 500 nm. It has been confirmed that an NP has the potential to improve the solubility and stability of an encapsulated drug, enhance transport across membranes, and prolong retention time to improve efficacy and safety [90,91]. Based on these advantages, NP research has been increasingly used for drug development and application. Currently, nanoparticles (NPs) are mainly divided into three classes based on structural differences, namely polymeric NPs, inorganic NPs and lipid-based NPs, each of which has its own strengths and weaknesses. For example, inorganic NPs are well suited for theranostic applications due to their unique electrical, magnetic, and optical properties. However, toxicity and solubility limitations have become the obstacle to clinical therapy for inorganic NPs. Lipid-based NPs have simple structures, high bioavailability, and payload flexibility, while their encapsulation efficiency (EE) is low. Compared with the above NPs, polymeric NPs have more advantages, such as high payload for hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs, precise control of particle properties and easy surface modification, as well as high EE. In addition, they are stable during storage, especially biodegradable polymers with low aggregation and toxicity [92]. For these reasons, biodegradable polymeric NPs have increasingly become a focus of research in nanomedicine. In recent years, more and more studies on biodegradable polymeric NPs loaded with flavonoids have been published. Therefore, we will focus on the presentation of biodegradable polymeric NPs in the following part.",

            "text": "During the last decade, development of nanoparticle-based therapeutic agents has been extensively studied, and nano-delivery systems are the area of prime importance for specifically targeting the desired area in the treatment of many diseases. \n\nCurrently, the majority of nanoparticles used for the targeting delivery approach are made of polymers or lipids. Even though polymeric nanoparticles demonstrate great advantages in disease therapy, they also present disadvantages such as difficulties in scaling up, usage of organic solvents in their fabrication process, biocompatibility, cytotoxicity, and immunogenicity. On the other hand, lipid-based nanoparticles exhibit the ability to cross hard-to-reach sites, even without any surface functionalization, because of their similarity to cell membrane. Thus, lipid-based nano-delivery systems are considered as the next generation of therapeutics. \n\nAs of today, therapeutic nanoparticles are mostly developed for the treatment or prevention of only one disease. However, researchers started to combine various drug molecules as well as various types of nanoparticles, thereby, the future of therapeutic nanoparticles is guided to the direction of multi-therapeutic nanoparticles to be designed for the treatment of more than one disease. \n\nAlthough nanoparticle-based delivery systems contribute significantly to the targeted therapy with improved efficiency, reduced side effects, and better bioavailability, we still know very little about the metabolism, clearance, and toxicity of nanoparticles. To date, most of the published studies demonstrate the encapsulation of clinical drugs with nanoparticles. However, the studies on other therapeutics, like genes, enzymes, or DNA/RNA, are still limited. The significance of published data is often approved with patents; however, a few of them can pass the trials and become commercially available in the market. This suggests that additional studies are required about the formulation, fabrication, and toxicity of nanoparticles. Moreover, cost of nanomedicine and manufacturing at larger scale is another important issue needing to be addressed. The lack of financial input or the poor cost-benefit balance prevents the progress of therapeutics from their inception to the market.",

This review synthesizes key insights from the current literature to highlight the pivotal role of nanoparticles in advancing the field of mRNA vaccines. \n\nRole of Nanoparticles in mRNA Vaccine Formulation: Nanoparticles, particularly lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) and polymeric nanoparticles, serve as effective carriers for mRNA molecules, protecting them from enzymatic degradation and facilitating their efficient delivery into target cells. LNPs, exemplified by the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines, encapsulate mRNA encoding viral antigens, enabling robust immune responses and high vaccine efficacy. \n\nAdvantages of Nanoparticle-Based Delivery Systems: The use of nanoparticles enhances vaccine stability by preventing premature mRNA degradation and optimizing its bioavailability. Advanced nanoparticle designs, including surface modifications and the incorporation of stabilizing agents, prolong mRNA's half-life and facilitate controlled release kinetics, which are crucial for sustained antigen expression and prolonged immune stimulation. \n\nCharacterization and Optimization of Nanoparticles: Critical to nanoparticle-enhanced mRNA vaccines is the characterization of nanoparticle properties using techniques such as dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy, and spectroscopic methods. These analyses ensure uniform particle size distribution, structural integrity, and surface charge optimization, contributing to vaccine consistency and reproducibility. \n\nClinical Success and Safety Profiles: Clinical trials of nanoparticle-based mRNA vaccines have demonstrated high efficacy rates against infectious diseases like COVID-19, underscoring their clinical relevance and translational potential. Safety profiles indicate manageable adverse reactions primarily associated with transient local reactogenicity, highlighting the overall safety of nanoparticle formulations in diverse patient populations. \n\nChallenges and Mitigation Strategies: Despite advancements, challenges such as immune activation, biocompatibility concerns, and scalability issues remain significant hurdles in nanoparticle-based mRNA vaccine development. Addressing these challenges requires rigorous preclinical evaluation, the optimization of manufacturing processes, and adherence to stringent regulatory guidelines to ensure vaccine safety, efficacy, and global accessibility.",

            "text": "The success of mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 has further highlighted the potential of LNPs in nucleic acid delivery, demonstrating their stability and effectiveness in clinical applications [100]. Studies have also demonstrated that LNPs can effectively deliver mRNA to cancer cells, resulting in significant antitumor activity [100]. LNPs can effectively protect the genetic cargo from degradation. Their ability to bypass endosomal trapping (endosomal escape), principally through membrane inversion, however, remains poor, resulting in the delivery of only ~ 2% of nucleic acids to the cytosol of target cells [111]. Another noteworthy characteristic of LNPs is their tendency to accumulate in the liver upon systemic intravenous administration, which can lead to potential liver-targeting therapeutic strategies [112] once the concern of hepatotoxicity is resolved. \n\nLipid nanoemulsions are colloidal dispersions of two immiscible liquids, typically oil (lipid) and water, stabilized by a surfactant monolayer at the interface, forming droplets ranging from 20 to 200 nm in diameter. Like other lipid-based nanocarriers, lipid nanoemulsions are well-suited for delivering hydrophobic drugs and can protect cargoes from enzymatic degradation and offer controlled release. Compared with other lipid-based nanocarriers, lipid nanoemulsions offer less expensive manufacturing, but challenges include the potential toxicity of surfactants and relatively fewer opportunities for surface modification [105]. Lipid nanoemulsions have been explored as carriers for hydrophobic drugs, including chemotherapeutic agents such as paclitaxel [113] and doxorubicin [114], phytochemicals such as curcumin [115,116], nucleic acids [117], and proteins. \n\nWhile the previously discussed lipid-based nanocarriers are liquid at body temperatures and rely on amphiphilic interactions for stability, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) include a core made of lipids with high melting temperatures. So, this solid core at body temperature offers improved encapsulation efficiency, stability, and drug-release properties compared to liposomes.",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles can be broadly classified into five categories, depending on the method of preparation and the different physicochemical properties of their formulation. Their respective names are Liposomes, Niosome, Transfersome, Solid Lipid Nanoparticles (SLNs) and Nanostructured Lipid Carriers (NLCs). The different physical and chemical properties of different components make different types of LNPs provide unique and distinct advantages for the delivery of different nanomedicine. In clinical application, different types of LNPs have targeted and wide uses to meet the drug administration needs of different types of drugs. \n\nLiposomes are the most commonly used lipid nanoparticles, spherical in shape and typically 10-1000 nm in size, and the main body of phospholipids and cholesterol gives Liposomes good bio-affinity and the ability to encapsulate and protect lipophilic drugs. Liposomes are the first nano-drug delivery platforms to be used in the clinic and are also highly reproducible, allowing for mass production in a simple step-by-step process. However, their high cholesterol content makes them more rigid than several other LNPs, making them less penetrating and more susceptible to cuticle restriction in skin delivery. They are also less efficient in encapsulating hydrophilic drugs, which can lead to drug leakage. Today, liposomes have been widely used as delivery vehicles for various vaccines, vaccine adjuvants, and gene editing technologies [16]. \n\nNiosomes is an alternative to Liposome. They use a non-ionic surfactant instead of the phospholipid in the original Liposome and has a particle size of 10-1000 nm. This gives them a longer shelf life and better stability. In addition, the Niosomes are electrically neutral compared to the traditional Liposome, which makes them more biocompatible. However, the neutral nature of the body also makes them less efficient for drug encapsulation and tends to lead to particle aggregation in the body. Niosomes are currently used mainly for drug delivery against the blood-brain barrier [17].",

These lipid nanoparticles, employed as drug delivery systems, boast a multitude of enticing attributes, including exceptional biocompatibility, ease of synthesis, tissue specificity, evasion of the reticuloendothelial system, controlled drug release, scalability, non-toxicity, and precision-targeted delivery [7]. Biodegradable polymeric nano-based targeted drug delivery technologies have demonstrated remarkable advantages in achieving precise local delivery while minimizing unintended off-target side effects [8]. Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) show promise in drug delivery due to enhanced stability and controlled release. Yet, achieving precise organ and site-specific delivery is a complex task. Overcoming barriers like particle size optimization and evading defense mechanisms is essential. Tailoring SLNs to distinct organs is ongoing research, holding great potential [9].",

            "text": "Helper phospholipids and cholesterol stabilize the nanoparticle structure and aid in intracellular delivery of the cargo (Cheng and Lee, 2016). PEG-lipids modulate the surface properties of LNPs, including particle size and zeta potential, and affect their interactions with the environment, which can impact circulation time and clearance rate (Mui et al., 2013;Ryals et al., 2020;Kim et al., 2021). The choice of each lipid components (Nogueira et al., 2020;Patel et al., 2020), ratios between the different lipids (Yanez Arteta et al., 2018;Kulkani et al., 2018), ratios between lipids and nucleic acids (Kulkarni et al., 2018;Carrasco et al., 2021), as well as the type and length of oligonucleotide cargo (Aburai et al., 2020;Li et al., 2023), are all factors that could be fine-tuned for desirable outcomes. \n\nIn addition to variations in common chemical components, a host of other parameters can also dramatically affect LNP size, structure and chemistry. For example, new chemistries have been explored, such as the covalent addition of peptides to lipids that may aid in targeting LNPs to specific cells (Endsley and Ho, 2012). The physical mixing process to form LNPs can be done with various microfluidic designs or robotic handling (Chen et al., 2012;Sarode et al., 2022). pH-dependent structural changes of LNPs have also been studied to gain further insights on LNP formation and drug release (Yu et al., 2023). LNPs can change as a function of time (Ball et al., 2017), thus limiting shelf life. Storage methods may include highly concentrated solutions, freezing (\u221220 or \u221280 \u00b0C) or lyophilization, and require identification of beneficial excipients. Once delivered to biological tissues, structural changes may enhance targeting and therapeutic release. \n\nThe characterization of structural features has depended on small-angle scattering (SAS) and/or cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM).",

A nanoscale material may be a natural, incidental or a manufactured material comprising of particles, either in an unbound state or as an aggregate, wherein the size range of one or more external dimensions is between 1 and 100 nm for \u226550% (threshold between 1 and 50%) of the particles, according to the number size distribution that encapsulates a therapeutic compound (Arms et al., 2018;Soares et al., 2018). Some of the nanoscale systems that can be employed for drug delivery are lipid-based vehicles, polymer-based delivery systems, metal nanoparticles, nanoshells, and non-injectable nanovectors (Riehemann et al., 2009). Liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) are the lipid-based nanoparticles that facilitate the transport of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic molecules, controlled drug release with a very low or no toxicity (Garc\u00eda-Pinel et al., 2019). In polymer-based delivery systems, the polymer may be of natural origin like chitosan, starch, alginate, cellulose; biosynthesized, poly-\u03b2-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) or chemically synthesized materials like polylactic acid (PLA), polyurethane, poly(lactic-glycolic acid) (PLGA), polymethyl methacrylate resin (PMMA). Some of the main advantages of these of these polymer-based delivery systems include high biological safety, good biodegradability, and safe delivery of the drug (Han et al., 2018).",

            "text": "Three different types of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been used for ophthalmic formulations: solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNPs), nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs), and hybrid lipid nanoparticles. SLNPs are aqueous colloidal dispersions composed of solid lipids as a matrix material with the capacity to encapsulate hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs. SLNPs are provided with multiple advantages such as physical stability, protection of the encapsulated drug, controlled release, biocompatibility, feasible production, and the possibility of being sterilized by autoclaving [88][89][90][91]. On the other hand, SLNs have limited drug loading and expulsion for both hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs. Loaded drugs are usually located between fatty acid chains, in lipid layers, or in crystal imperfections [92]. NLCs consist of a mixture of solid and liquid lipids, and they exhibit a higher drug-loading capacity and longer stability than SLNPs [93]. Finally, hybrid lipid nanoparticles modified by multifunctional polymers [94] combine the merits of polymeric nanoparticles and lipid-based systems, which improve the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of the loaded drug [95]. \n\nExperimentally, LNPs have been used for the delivery of substances to the posterior segment of the eye via corneal and non-corneal pathways. Araujo et al. [96] developed a nanometric (\u223c200 nm), unimodal, and negatively charged NLC loaded with the fluorescent lipid, Nile red (NR-NLC) marker and a drug, triamcinolone acetonide (TA). The method used for the construction of the NLC was high-pressure homogenization. After NR-NLC eyedrop instillation in mice, lipophilic actives were released into the posterior segment of the eye. Retinal fluorescence of Nile red gradually increased over time, peaking 40 min after administration and almost disappearing at 160 min.",

            "text": "In the field of nanomedicine, lipid-based nanoparticles have garnered significant attention due to their distinctive properties and their potential for various applications in drug delivery [1,2]. Researchers have developed multiple types of lipid-based nanoparticles, each offering unique advantages and properties (Figure 1). Micelles, on the other hand, are self-assemblies of lipid monolayers in aqueous solutions, forming structures with a hydrophobic core [3]. The hydrophobic core of a micelle is particularly well-suited to the encapsulation of small hydrophobic molecules. They can serve as effective carriers for the delivery of hydrophobic drugs, enhancing solubility and stability. Solid lipid nanoparticles feature a surfactant shell encasing a solid lipid core matrix [4,5]. The solid matrix of solid lipid nanoparticles imparts stability and enables the controlled release properties, making them valuable in various drug delivery applications. Another notable lipid-based nanoparticle variant is liposomes, which consist of one or more lipid bilayers encompassing an aqueous core [6,7]. Liposomes can be categorized based on their lamellarity and size. Due to their unique structure, liposomes have the capacity to encapsulate both hydrophobic and hydrophilic small molecules, positioning them as versatile carriers for a wide array of therapeutic agents. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) represent a versatile class of lipid-based nanoparticles characterized by a lipid shell enveloping an inner core composed of reverse micelles [8][9][10]. This structure enables LNPs to effectively encapsulate and deliver diverse oligonucleotides, including siRNA, mRNA, and plasmid DNA. LNPs are renowned for their excellent stability and efficient intracellular delivery, making them highly suitable for nucleic-acid-based therapy. \n\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 13 composed of reverse micelles [8][9][10].",

            "text": "The efficacy of drug therapy is dependent on the distribution of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). A well-designed distribution system aims to produce an optimal degree of API at the activity site, resulting in the strongest therapeutic response and the fewest side effects possible. On the other hand, individual discrepancies in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters make designing dosage regimens more difficult. New innovations, such as lipid-based colloidal carriers, are being introduced to ensure proper clinical reaction. Most traditional formulations aim for immediate API availability to ensure fast and full systemic absorption. Several new API distribution frameworks have recently been introduced to enable APIs to be published at a controlled and predictable pace. Lipid-based colloidal carriers, such as nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) and solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN), have attracted a great deal of interest in several novel delivery mechanisms. Several modified-release SLNs and NLCs optimized for different administration routes have been developed for multiple APIs based on their physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties as well as the impact induced. For example, polymeric nanoparticles, liposomes, and regular oil-in-water (o/w) emulsions have advantages that lipid nanoparticles (SLNs and NLCs) do not have. Particles with diameters between 120 and 200 nm are seldom cleared by RES cells, preventing liver and spleen filtration [92], and various release profiles may be obtained since the API is inserted into the lipid matrix [94][95][96]. Particles with longer circulation times and hence greater ability to target the site of interest should be 120-200 nm in diameter and have a hydrophilic surface (external hydrophilic polymer corona) in order to reduce the clearance by macrophages. \n\nOne of the most significant disadvantages of drug delivery nanoparticles is the rapid clearance of carrier from the bloodstream by the reticulo endothelial system (RES). Following intravenous administration, the carriers first come into contact with plasma/serum proteins (opsonins) before they reach the target cells.",

Furthermore, exosomes, which are cell-derived vesicles that have a structure similar to that of liposomes and contain nucleic acids and proteins, have been investigated as novel drug delivery systems (DDS) (Chung et al., 2016;Kim et al., 2016;Lu et al., 2018;Rayamajhi et al., 2019;Zheng et al., 2019). The functionalization of DDS carriers has been investigated for the efficient delivery of therapeutic drugs and has been reported to improve targeting and intracellular translocation by modifying functional lipids with molecules, such as antibodies, small molecules, and peptides (Song et al., 2009;Kibria et al., 2011;Lu et al., 2018;Moghimipour et al., 2018). The quality of functional lipids, such as molecular weight distribution, dispersibility in water, and solubility in solvents, is important in terms of the production and quality control of nanoparticles. \n\nIn recent years, nanoparticle preparation methods using microfluidic devices have attracted increased attention as novel preparation methods, as they are used in methods for manufacturing LNP formulations, such as Onpattro\u00ae. Mixing between organic solvents and buffers in microchannels promotes the self-assembly of nanoparticles, and high-speed and strictly controlled mixing enables the preparation of uniform and highly reproducible nanoparticles (Zhigaltsev et al., 2012;Maeki et al., 2017). \n\nIn this way, the quality of functional lipids and the manufacturing method of nanoparticles play a crucial role in the clinical use of nanoparticles.",

Due to their unique size-dependent properties, lipid nanoparticles offer the possibility to develop new therapeutics. The ability to incorporate drugs into nanocarriers offers a new prototype in drug delivery that could be used for secondary and tertiary levels of drug targeting. Hence, solid lipid nanoparticles hold great promise for reaching the goal of controlled and site specific drug delivery and hence have attracted wide attention of researchers. This review presents a broad treatment of solid lipid nanoparticles discussing their advantages, limitations and their possible remedies. The different types of nanocarriers which were based on solid lipid like solid lipid nanoparticles, nanostructured lipid carriers, lipid drug conjugates are discussed with their structural differences. Different production methods which are suitable for large scale production and applications of solid lipid nanoparticles are described. Appropriate analytical techniques for characterization of solid lipid nanoparticles like photon correlation spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry are highlighted. Aspects of solid lipid nanoparticles route of administration and their biodistribution are also incorporated. If appropriately investigated, solid lipid nanoparticles may open new vistas in therapy of complex diseases.",

Four broad categories of materials used for nanoparticle synthesis include metals, lipids, carbon-based materials, as well as synthetic and natural polymers [2]. \n\nMetal and metal-oxide nanoparticles have long been implemented for theranostics and have recently been designed to conjugate target ligands, antigens, and immunomodulators on their surfaces. A few examples for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and type I diabetes (T1D), include iron oxide NPs, which have been popularly conjugated to high-avidity MHC peptide ligands, and gold NPs, modified with T-cell epitopes and 2-(1 \u2032 H-indole-3 \u2032 -carbonyl)-thiazole-4carboxylic acid methyl ester [42][43][44]. Gold and silicon nanoparticles, amongst others, have also been designed for various therapeutic applications [45]. However, the typical requirement for payloads to be conjugated to the nanoparticle metal surface may severely limit the types of molecules and, thus, applications of such particles [2]. Innocuous antigens and/or their epitopes, for example, may be difficult to implement with such metal or metal-oxide nanoparticles for antigen-specific tolerance. Additionally, while the stability of these particles can be highly favorable depending on the application, their lack of biodegradability has been demonstrated to increase tissue accumulation, creating toxicity and safety concerns [2,46]. Lipid-based nanoparticles (LNPs) are another popular nanoparticle of choice and have been clinically used for a variety of FDA-approved applications, ranging from ONPATTRO \u00ae polyneuropathy therapy to the mRNA-1274 (Moderna, Cambridge, MA, USA) and BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech, New York, NY, USA) COVID-19 vaccines [47,48].",

Carbon nanotubes and mesoporous silica nanoparticles are examples of inorganic nanoparticles. For instance, liposomes, a type of nano drug delivery system, have been extensively explored [10] . Doxil, a liposomal formulation of doxorubicin, showed improved efficacy and reduced cardiotoxicity compared to the free drug, leading to its approval for the treatment of ovarian cancer and AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma [11] . \n\nDespite their potential, nano drug delivery systems face certain challenges that need to be addressed for their successful translation into clinical applications [12] . The stability and storage of nano drug delivery systems present additional challenges. The complex manufacturing and scale-up processes involved in ensuring consistent quality, reproducibility, and scalability of nanoparticles pose a significant challenge [13] . Establishing standardized guidelines for assessing safety, efficacy, and quality is essential for facilitating regulatory approval and market entry.

            "text": "Nanoplatforms that can be used to deliver mRNA in the body include polymer-based nanoparticles, polymer-lipid hybrid nanoparticles, polypeptides, protein derivatives, complexes of protein mRNA derivatives, and gold nanoparticles. All of these have the relative ease of large-scale production, scaling their manufacturing ability, to provide the ability to deliver enclosed mRNA delivery to ribosome mRNA (via endosome escape), and flexibility is used to modify the surface with a ligand to further target specific cells [44,58]. Lipids are the best choice for mRNA transfer due to their fusion compatibility with lipid cell membranes [59]. Some advancements in lipid nanoparticles are listed in Figure 3. First, to identify lipids, it must be noted that these are amphiphilic molecules that consist of a hydrophobic tail region, a polar head group, and a linker between the two groups [60]. LNPs are stable, biocompatible particles with a bilayer lipid shell consisting of four components: cationic/ionizable lipids, PEG, auxiliary lipids, and cholesterol, that encompass an aqueous core in which they can carry mRNA to protect it from destruction (Figure 4) [22,59,61]. The ratio of these components varies based on the target tissue, and are differentiated from liposomes due to the lack of a hollow nucleus [59]. It can be noted that the function of liposomes in drug delivery is absorption. Liposomes are also spherical lipid vesicles but have two concentric lipid layers and reach one or more layers that are confined to a water space (Figure 4). Liposomes have the ability to carry hydrophobic and hydrophilic molecules. Cationic liposomes, which are mainly composed of cationic lipids, can effectively concentrate nucleic acids due to positive charges [56,62]. The comparison between liposomes and LNPs is shown in Table 1. The use of liposomes in mRNA delivery can have the advantage that they can protect mRNA against nucleases, they have high transfer efficiencies, and because of their resemblance to cell membranes, they can easily combine with receptor cells.",

            "text": "Many of these nano-delivery systems, notably LCHNPs, have demonstrated signi\ue103cantly enhanced bactericidal activity compared to free drugs, particularly against intracellular bacterial strains and bio\ue103lms. In addition to delivering existing antibiotics, LCHNPs with inorganic and metallic materials also possess potent antimicrobial properties. However, despite of their outstanding potential, there has not been any clinical translations arising from this technology, not only because of their complex constituents but also the many barriers faced by this nano-delivery system. Some issues that need to be addressed include understanding the interactions of nanoparticles with biological systems, solving the issues of nanoparticle aggregation in physiological \ue104uids, and characterizing these nanoparticles under physiological conditions. \n\nScalable manufacturing remains as one of the biggest challenges faced by nanoparticle therapies. The scale-up production of single-material systems or formulations, such as liposomes and polymeric nanoparticles loaded with an active pharmaceutical ingredient, have already been successfully achieved and are widely utilized by the pharmaceutical industry. The rapid development of new biomaterials, complex nanostructures and novel synthesis approaches will continue to pose new challenges to the scalable production of these technologies. 1][142][143] The PRINT process enables the speci\ue103c design and large-scale synthesis of well-de\ue103ned micro-and nanoparticles with uniformed size and shape. In addition, a double usage of spray-drying technique serves as a promising large-scale method to assemble lipids  onto nanoparticle surfaces. Accompanied with these advanced techniques, the large-scale production of LCHNPs with acceptable batch-to-batch variation that is free of contamination could be achieved. \n\nGiven the usage of LCHNPs in the biological environment, it is therefore of great importance to evaluate its performance under relevant biological conditions. Usually, given limited research resources, in vitro evaluation of delivery systems on cells/bacterial cells is reported. However, in vitro studies by introducing nanoparticles onto planktonic bacteria o\ue09den lack the complexities of a true biological environment. 144 For clinical translation, the use of appropriate animal models to assess in vivo performances, such as tolerability, biodistribution, toxicity, and potential side effects, are o\ue09den mandatory. 145",

            "text": "Advances in biomaterials promote the development of nanomedicine. In the above discussion, it is easy to see that each type of nanodrug delivery system has its own advantages. LNPs, which are mainly formed from phospholipids, are nontoxic, biocompatible and biodegradable and can also reduce the toxic effects of carrier molecules, which means they are particularly suitable for oral or other routes of drug delivery. Polymers have various compositions, sizes, morphologies and surface properties that can be adjusted by applying different ingredients and manufacturing methods for specific applications. Tailoring polymers can improve organ selectivity by introducing targeting groups. Meanwhile, some inorganic nanoparticles, such as AgNPs and AuNPs, can bind to viral surface receptors and prevent viruses from entering the host cell. However, it is important to note that LNP has been shown to induce immune reactions on several previous occasions, suggesting that potential immune reactions should be considered. In addition, although inorganic nanoparticles or nanodelivery systems have good antiviral activity, they are difficult to degrade in living organisms and tend to accumulate in the body, causing organ toxicity. In contrast, cationic polymers can bind to negatively charged cell membranes to increase permeability and facilitate endocytosis, but they also show cytotoxicity by damaging the cell membranes and reducing the DNA release rate.\n\nTherefore, some factors need to be considered when developing nanodrugs for antiviral therapy. First, the choice of nanodelivery systems depends on the characteristics of the antiviral drug. For example, the activity of the antiviral drug suramin is often limited by its difficulty in penetrating cell membranes and poor cellular internalization, and the use of cationic LNP can overcome this obstacle very well. To inhibit the adhesion of LNP to mucus and make it easier to pass through epithelial cells, LNP can be modified with PEG to improve their molecularly neutral nature. Second, as a drug delivery vehicle, the efficiency of drug release at the targeted site is also a key problem that needs to be considered. Nucleic acid drugs, for example, are of great interest because of their ability to act directly on diseasecausing target genes or target mRNAs to treat disease at",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) containing ionizable lipids are the most clinically advanced platform for mRNA delivery, but their application beyond the liver remains challenging. Polymer-lipid hybrid nanoparticles offer a promising alternative, combining the synthetic versatility and unique properties of polymers with the biocompatibility of lipid excipients. While the significance of alkyl tail design is well-recognized for ionizable lipids, the impact of the polymer side chain composition on interactions with lipid excipients, mRNA delivery efficacy, and tissue specificity remains poorly understood. Here, we focus on a class of ionizable amino-polyesters (APEs) that exhibit features desired for potential clinical applications, including narrow molecular weight distribution and a good safety profile, and investigate the effect of polymer side chain composition on the formulation of APE lipid nanoparticles (APE-LNPs) for mRNA delivery. A library of 36 APEs was synthesized via ring-opening polymerization of chemically diverse tertiary amino-alcohols and lactone monomers with distinct alkyl side chain compositions, including variations in length and unsaturation. We show that optimal alkyl side chain length is critical for the assembly of stable mRNA nanoparticles and efficient mRNA delivery both in vitro and in vivo. Top-performing APE-LNPs display superior delivery efficacy in vitro and in extrahepatic tissues compared to benchmark LNPs, including DLin-MC3-DMA ionizable lipid. The polymer chain composition affects the tissue selectivity of APE-LNPs, with shorter side chains (4-5 carbons) effectively targeting the spleen and lungs, while longer chains (7-9 carbons) show enhanced liver delivery. We also explored the relevance of lipid excipients in APE-LNPs, demonstrating the essential role of unsaturated phospholipids in enhancing cellular uptake and mRNA delivery, and the limited relevance of cholesterol. These findings provide valuable insights into the design of polymers for use in the LNP context, which could aid the development of polymeric alternatives to ionizable lipids and expand the utility of mRNA LNP technology to nonliver tissues.",

These NPs can be categorized based on their structure and composition. In particular, LNPs offer advantages such as biodegradability, biocompatibility, and safety, which are ideal characteristics for a vaccine delivery system [157]. LPNs can facilitate the delivery of mRNA and protect it from rapid degradation by RNases [68]. Additionally, LNPs can interact with the immune system, enhancing cellular and humoral immunity. They have been pivotal in the development of vaccines and other nanomedicines [68,158]. Furthermore, there are many examples of lipid-based NP vaccines that have been widely used in preclinical and clinical studies (Table 3). ICMVs have an aqueous core surrounded by multilayers of lipids. Their robust lipid wall protects the particles from serum-mediated degradation, enabling stable delivery of vaccine components to lymphoid tissues and thus generating potent antibody responses. ICMVs can serve as a delivery system for both hydrophilic and hydrophobic antigens and adjuvants, showing promise as a vaccination strategy against cancers and intracellular pathogens [181]. Studies have demonstrated that ICMVs with both surface-conjugated and encapsulated malarial antigens offer superior vaccination protection compared to soluble antigens due to the prolonged persistence of antigens in the draining lymph nodes [182]. Despite these values, ICMVs have some disadvantages, such as the complexity of production, the risk of triggering an unintended immune response, the unpredictable release of encapsulated substances from ICMVs, and the fact that techniques used to produce ICMVs may not be easily scaled up for industrial production, limiting their widespread application [181].",

            "text": "Recently, targeted drug delivery systems have gained much importance for delivering many kinds of drugs as well as imaging agents, particularly to the targeted disease cells or tissues. The diagnosis and treatment of brain disorders is an extremely challenging task. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is the primary obstacle in conveying the chemotherapeutic and diagnostic agents that prompt the insufficient delivery of drug at the brain-targeted site. Many drug molecules are non-soluble in aqueous systems, unable to cross BBB, or present severe side effects. Lipid-based nanoparticle (LBNP) systems represent one of the most potential colloidal carriers. They are preferred over polymeric nanoparticles due to their high stability, excellent targeting ability,increased loading capacity, non-toxicity, low production costs, and ease of preparation. Combining drug with lipid nanoparticles reduces the therapeutic dose and toxicity, decreases drug resistance, and increases drug levels in the targeted tissue. This review presents the different types of LBNPs developed in recent years and theirapplication in brain disorders.",

            "text": "Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) are two major types of lipid-based nanocarriers developed to overcome the limitations of other colloidal carriers, such as emulsions, liposomes and polymeric nanoparticles (Naseri et al., 2015). Some of these limitations include limited stability when stored over extended periods, poor batch-to-batch reproducibility, low drug loading capacity (LC) and failure to manipulate biological membrane barriers to achieve sufficient API delivery for therapeutic activity (Beija et al., 2012;Riehemann et al., 2009). The encapsulation of drug molecules in nanoparticles shields them from the effect of efflux transporters and the small particle size facilitates uptake of drugs across biological membranes (Ahmad et al., 2018b). SLN and NLC are nanovectors manufactured using solid lipids or a combination of solid and liquid lipids, respectively (Mehnert and Mader, 2002;Riehemann et al., 2009). SLN are usually used as aqueous dispersions and are produced using a solid lipid, an API and surfactant(s) which impart stability to the system (Mehnert and Mader, 2002). NLC differ from SLN only from an excipients point of view, in that binary mixtures of solid and liquid lipids are used for formulation (Uner, 2006). In addition to excellent physical stability, SLN and NLC have an ability to exhibit complex functions, such as controlled delivery of API across different biological membrane barriers and consequently targeting organs leading to adhesion and improved cellular uptake (Ahmad et al., 2018b;Naseri et al., 2015;Riehemann et al., 2009). \n\nThe manufacture of SLN or NLC formulations involves melting a solid lipid or a binary mixture of solid and liquid lipid, followed by re-dispersion of the molten lipids as submicron-size droplets in an aqueous medium containing surfactant(s) (Uner, 2006).",

Initially synthetic/natural polymers were ideally used to manufacture .It suited to optimize drug delivery and reduce toxicity. Speiser and coworkers in the mid-seventies introduces polymeric nanoparticles. This developed as a variable substitute to liposomes as drug carriers after few years. Any nano drug delivery's success is by its ability to penetrate through several anatomical barriers, sustained release of their contents and their stability in the nanometer size. In spite of overwhelming advantages of polymeric nano particles, not many products made it to market because of certain stumbling blocks like presence of solvent residues left over from production, the cytotoxicity of the polymers, and the lack of low-cost, qualified large scale production units yielding a product of a quality acceptable by the regulatory authorities, the scarcity of safe polymers have limited the wide spread application of nanoparticles to clinical medicine 2 To overcome these limitations of polymeric nanoparticles, lipids have been put forward as an alternative carrier, particularly for lipophilic pharmaceuticals. 3 These lipid nanoparticles are known as solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) developed in 1991. In 1999, the complete patent rights for production of SLN by high pressure homogenization have been acquired by SkyePharma 4 . Great progress was made in treating different diseases using SLN .SLNs are colloidal carriers developed in the last decade as an alternative system to the existing traditional carriers (emulsions, liposomes and polymeric nanoparticles). They are a new generation of submicron-sized lipid emulsions where the liquid lipid (oil) has been substituted by a solid lipid. SLN has special qualities such as small size, large surface area, high drug loading and the interaction of phases at the interfaces, and are attractive for their potential to improve performance of pharmaceuticals, neutraceuticals and other materials.",

With the approval of two COVID-19 mRNA vaccines (Comirnaty \u00ae (Pfizer-BioNTech), and Spikevax \u00ae (Moderna)), the preferred nano-delivery system is commonly lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) (Guerin Thompson, 2021). LNP can be prepared with different techniques, such as conventional lipid Thin-Film Hydration subsequent Size-Reduction Techniques, Ethanol-Injection Method, and nextgeneration In-line T-junction mixing and microfluidic mixing which are all based on a rapid mixing self-assembly process, namely a spontaneous organization of individual lipid molecule into a nanostructured sphere driven by non-covalent interactions (Figure 3) (Shepherd et al., 2021). Microfluidic mixing is a promising new method for preparing large-scale lipid-based cargos. It is well-made and can be expanded from the research laboratory to good manufacturing practice (GMP) production preferred nowadays for use in clinical trials and commercial pharmaceuticals. Another advantage of the microfluidics method is the ability to control various parameters. LNP formulations typically consist of 1) an ionizable or cationic lipid, possessing a positive charged tertiary or quaternary amines head to interact with the mRNA macromolecular; 2) a helper lipid (e.g., DSPC) acting like the phospholipid in the hydrophobic membrane; 3) cholesterol providing stabilization of the LNP bilayer; and 4) an outer PEGylated-surface to give the nanoparticle a hydrophilic surface, lengthen the blood circulation time and reduce nonspecific protein absorption (Kowalski et al., 2019).",

In addition, of this, several nanoscale Drug Delivery Systems (DDSs) such as micelle, poly (D, L-lactic-co-glycolic acid(13), liposome3) ), dendrimer (14), and mesoporous silica nanoparticles (15) have been recently developed and examined for ELT delivery in the cancer treatment. \n\nAmong the described drug nanocarriers, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) such as Liposomes, phytosomes, nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs), etc are available for DDSs of ELT delivery. LNPs as an effective systematic drug administration method is able to enhance the solubilization and stabilization of several drugs by protection of them from the biological fluids, and limitation of nonspecific cytotoxicity (16,17). It is reported that LNPs contain different advantages that make them a unique oral drug delivery system, including low cost raw materials, exclusively compared with phospholipids, easy scale-up and manufacture, high stability and storage, controlled release, and high versatility (17,18). Liposome and NLCs are interesting nanocarriers based on LNPs that could deliver their cargoes via encapsulation route (19,20). The first aim of the present study was to characterize and optimize different formulations of NLC and liposome ELTloaded systems. The second aim was to study in-vitro anti-cancer activity of the optimized formulations of ELT-liposome and ELT-NLC by assessment of their cellular cytotoxicity, apoptosis, and DNA fragmentations.",

Benefits of nanoparticle drug delivery systems include minimised irritant reactions and improved penetration within the body due to their small size, allowing for intravenous and other delivery routes. Oral administration is the most convenient route among various routes of drug delivery as it offers high patient compliance. However, the poor aqueous solubility and poor enzymatic/metabolic stability of drugs are major limitations in successful oral drug delivery. There are several approaches to improve problems related to hydrophobic drugs. Among various approaches, nanotechnology-based drug delivery system has potential to overcome the challenges associated with the oral route of administration. Novel drug delivery systems are available in many areas of medicine. Nanoparticles (NPs) and other colloidal drug-delivery systems modify the kinetics, drug distribution in the body and release profile of an associated drug. Nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) have been promising formulation for effective oral drug delivery and opening new possibilities for NLCs in future pharmaceutical applications. Nanostructure lipid carriers (NLCs) are nanosized-based carrier systems which comprise solid lipid matrix combined with liquid lipids and surfactants. The aim of the paper is to explore the various advantages of formulation technology along with the characterization parameter of the NLCs.",

These characteristics enable the large-scale production of SLNPs; however, some challenges must be resolved in future industrial manufacturing, such as polymorphism, phase separation, and sterilization resulting from manufacturing processes [9]. Polymeric nanomedicines, including polymeric nanoparticles, micelles, and polymersomes, have many advantages for cancer therapy, such as a solubilizing ability for hydrophobic drugs, significant drugsustained release, reduced drug toxicity, and enhanced drug accumulation in tumors [10]. To enhance the in vivo therapeutic efficacy, various multifunctional nanomedicines have been reported, for example, spontaneous property transitions in response to endogenous and/or exogenous stimuli (e.g., pH, temperature, light, ultrasound, redox, and enzyme) for specific delivery. However, these nanomedicines usually have sophisticated structures, causing difficulties in large-scale production, in vivo characterization, and clinical translation. In the review article \"'One-for-All' approach: a black technology for nanomedicine development\", Youqing Shen et al. provide a promising strategy of \"One-for-All\", in which the polymeric nanocarrier prepared from phospholipid-affinitive poly (tertiary amine-oxide) has a simple structure but enables all the properties necessary for an in vivo delivery process. Because the tumor microenvironment (TME) plays an important role in cancer procession and metastasis, modulating the TME has been an alternate cancer treatment strategy, offering reduced toxicity and enhancing other cancer therapies [11,12]. Polymeric nanomedicines have substantial potential in remodeling the TME, owing to their controlled synthesis, high modifiability, and tunable responses to various stimuli [13].",

            "text": "Beyond this obvious advantage, further development of LNP-based PDT agents has resulted in some new strategies in leveraging nanoparticles for PDT. \n\nOne optically active LNP agent was first reported by Lovell et al. (2011) with self-assembling porphyrin-lipid nanoparticles (Porphysomes) that exhibited high biocompatibility, minimal systemic toxicity (up to 1,000 mg/kg in mice), photothermal activation in the intact state and photodynamic activation when dissociated after cell uptake (Guidolin et al., 2021). Other iterations of Porphysomes have demonstrated theranostic capabilities with fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging (Muhanna et al., 2015). These examples show that LNP systems for PDT can not only gives the expected biocompatibility and distribution benefits as with chemotherapeutic payloads but can also present opportunities for unique new applications. Some drawbacks can still exist, however, namely, challenges in synthesis to achieve appropriate characteristics of size, polydispersity and encapsulation efficiency (Hou et al., 2021). Another issue is the tendency for LNP encapsulated PS to self-quench, which is why systems such as Porphysomes are not photodynamically active until dissociated into porphyrin-lipid monomers in vitro or in vivo (Muhanna et al., 2015). \n\nBeyond LNPs, the next most common nanocarrier platform for PSs is polymeric nanoparticles such as poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA). PLGA also has a track record of preclinical and clinical use to carry chemotherapeutic agents, albeit less developed than LNPs (Dinakaran et al., 2023). For the PLGA may have some advantages over LNP for photosensitizer delivery. PLGA is particularly effective at encapsulating strongly hydrophobic drugs such as PSs derived from porphyrins, hypocrellins and pthalocyanates (Kou et al., 2017).",

            "text": "Nanotechnology has been widely used to improve the oral absorption and therapeutic efficacy of small molecule peptide drugs, which have shown tremendous potentials but great challenges (Olbrich et al., 2001;Tan et al., 2009;Li et al., 2013;Yang et al., 2013;Thi et al., 2015;Wang et al., 2018). Poly-(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) nanoparticles have attracted much attention, owing to the unique properties of biodegradability, biocompatibility, and sustained release (Musumeci et al., 2006). Liposomes also have been applied for drug delivery due to the superior biocompatibility, drug absorption and nontoxicity (Wang and Liu, 2013). Unfortunately, both of them have some unsatisfied disadvantages in peptide delivery, such as leakage and safety issues, which seriously limited the delivery efficiency. It is necessary to deal with these problems for improving the oral delivery efficiency of peptides (Luo et al., 2006).\n\nLipid coating PLGA nanoparticles system (lipid nanoparticles, LNPs) has not only combined the advantages of polymer nanoparticles and liposomes but efficiently avoided the defects of them (Muller and Keck, 2004;Alavi et al., 2017). The dual advantages of the particles and vesicle make it an excellent oral drug carrier with high biocompatibility and sustained release (Xie et al., 2018). In this system, drugs can be efficiently encapsulated in the nanoparticles core and/or the lipid bilayers, resulted in increased drug load capability. The drug diffusion rate can be delayed by the polymer core. Additionally, the stability of the LNPs can be further increased by the lipid shell (Nogu\u00e9s et al., 2006). However, it is still challenging to achieve high encapsulation efficiency (EE) and decent particle size when incorporating hydrophilic drugs into LNPs.\n\nHypertension has become a strong risk factor for cardiovascular disease and affected almost 2 billion people. In detail, it has highly correlated with the heart attack, cerebral hemorrhage, stroke, kidney failure and blindness (Kje",

            "text": "The progress of lipidic nanocarriers to the current form of LNPs, which are the most sought after lipidic nanocarriers for clinical use nowadays, has been recently thoroughly reviewed by Tenchov et al. [1]. Overall, lipidic nanocarriers have been extensively explored, from their conventional uncharged vesicular form to the present day ionizable lipid core LNPs. In the present review, for simplicity of understanding, the general inherent principle of a bilayer surface is used in the figures to explain nanoparticle design elements and the way they work. \n\nHerein, we discuss some key design principles of LNPs. Specifically, we discuss the potency, biodegradability, and immunogenicity of LNP systems, which are important considerations for developing such systems. The basic design aspects of LNPs presented in this review hold true regardless of the type of drug cargo, i.e., macromolecules or small molecules. \n\nMoreover, the route of administration and targeting of LNPs to hepatic and nonhepatic targets depend on some key underlying considerations. We cover the rationale regarding the selection of the route of administration. We also briefly discuss targeting approaches to non-hepatic targets. \n\nBesides the above-mentioned product characteristics, one of the critical hurdles, however, with intracellular delivery of LNPs is the release of the drug cargo from the endosome [2]. It has been estimated that only <2% of API escapes the endosome intracellularly [3]. One of the core focus areas of LNP development, therefore, is the better design of these systems to enhance endosomal drug escape. Such LNP design strategies revolve around enhanced electrostatic charge interactions with the endosome and subsequent LNP destabilization to release the drug cargo. \n\nThe electrostatic-charge-based drug delivery mechanism has been an integral part of pH-sensitive liposomal drug delivery systems as well. pH-sensitive liposomes are strikingly similar to LNPs in that they contain pH-sensitive lipids akin to the ionizable pH-sensitive lipids in LNPs.",

            "text": "Nowadays, nanotechnology plays a vital role worldwide due to the benefits and potential it can provide to humans. A few decades ago, nanotechnology was implemented in industry, but this science has progressively influenced various areas of material applications, including the medical area [1]. In the biomedical field, nanotechnology offers many benefits regarding the treatment of various human diseases, taking into account precise target-oriented drug delivery to a specific organ. Generally, nanotechnology involves the study of well-defined nanostructures, by the association of nanoparticles under 100 nm with basic building blocks of different dimensions at the molecular level. Nanoparticles exhibit the great advantage of consisting in a small size and high surface area-to-volume ratio with the property of conjugation/encapsulation of different coating materials, such as organic polymers, organic surfactants, inorganic metals, inorganic compounds, or bioactive molecules [2]. Of all known structured nano-carriers, lipid nanostructures offer the possibility for developing novel therapeutics formulations, due to their unique and tailorabledependent properties. Lipids were promoted as alternative carriers, especially for lipophilic pharmaceutical products. Lipid nanoparticles known as solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) have attracted the attention of researchers because they improve the stability of pharmaceutical products and are also able to carry both lipophilic and hydrophilic drugs [3,4]. Compared to other colloidal carriers (polymeric, emulsions, liposomes), SLNs show many advantages, such as excellent biocompatibility (no toxicity because of the physiological biodegradable lipids), biodegradability, a less expensive fabrication process, sterilizability, easily industrially scaleable production, long-term stability, high entrapment efficiency, the association with the majority of molecules, and so on [5,6]. In addition to the aforementioned advantages, if they carry lipophilic drugs, the latter are automatically protected from the degradation process, because they are entrapped into the SLN lipid nanostructure [7].",

            "text": "Other biomaterials, such as polymer-based nanoparticles, allow more complicated architecture of biomaterial design and represent a new class of biomaterials entering clinical trials [95]. Furthermore, polymeric nanoparticles are similar to liposomes, but differ in key aspects. They are also lipid-based, but they vary according to the function they are designed for. Structurally, they are prepared as a solid lipid nanomaterial or with a liquid core. The necessary drug can be attached on the outside or can be housed inside the nanoparticle. In contrast, in liposomes (as seen in Fig. 2), the aqueous core houses the drug surrounded by a phospholipid bilayer. Additionally, polymeric nanoparticles have theoretical advantages in clinical medicine when compared to liposomes, but have yet to be proven. Their greatest advantage lies in our ability to alter their design, allowing researchers to customize specific materials for the required task. This ability helps tailor the drug's pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profile by changing the polymeric nanoparticle profile, resulting in more effective targeting of organ or tumor [96]. They also have a reliable profile in terms of degradation or metabolization, many of which can bypass hepatic metabolization and even the reticuloendothelial systems. However, liposomes have been in use much longer and are approved by the FDA for multiple drug formulations, currently conferring them an advantage for clinical use. Poly(l-glutamic acid)-paclitaxel, which can be functionalized to prolong circulation time, showed promising results in phase I/II trials but was halted at phase III due to lack of efficacy [97]. \n\nOther systems of nanoparticle delivery of other chemotherapeutics with adjuvant radiotherapy are currently being tested under clinical trials. Sanoff et al. provided their phase 1b and 2 results identifying a nanoparticle cyclodextrin-based polymer conjugated to campothecin that demonstrated initial success in safe dosing, limiting side effect profile [98].",

            "text": "Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) were first described in the nineties [93]. They are made of solid lipids well tolerated by the body (e.g., glycerides composed of fatty acids, which are commonly used in emulsions for parenteral nutrition, cholesterol [94], glycerol behenate (Compritol \u00ae 888 ATO) [94], glyceryl palmitostearate (Precirol \u00ae ATO 5) [95], glyceryl monostearates (Imwitor \u00ae 900) [96], tripalmitin [97] and other triglycerides such as tristearin, trilaurin, hard fats such as Witepsol series, cetyl palmitate, lipid acids such as stearic acid [98], palmitic acid [99]), thus minimizing the risk of acute and chronic toxicity [100]. SLNs are solid at room temperature, thus allowing reduced mobility for incorporated drugs, which is a desirable feature for controlled drug release. Their diameter usually varies between 50 nm and 1 \u00b5m, and they can be stabilized using non-toxic surfactants, polymers or both. Large-scale production can be performed in a cost-effective and relatively simple way using hot or cold high-pressure homogenization (HPH) or microemulsion techniques [98]. Other possible preparation methods, such as emulsification-solvent evaporation [101], solvent injection [102], solvent emulsification-diffusion [103,104] and ultrasonication [105], require the use of organic solvents and do not allow for easy scale up.\n\nAmong particulate formulations, solid lipid nanoparticles have been successfully explored for drug delivery because they combine the benefits of liquid lipid-based colloidal systems (e.g., emulsions and liposomes) and solid systems [106]. These products possess excellent tissue biocompatibility, biodegradability, composition flexibility and small size, making them suitable for a variety of applications. Furthermore, they have been found to enhance the drug bioavailability after oral or local administration. On the other hand, solid lipid particle manufacturing",

SLN can be prepared by a variety of technologies including heat or cold homogenization, which is easy to scale up production, has good preparation repeatability and does not require toxic organic solvents in the preparation process (16,18). The main feature of SLN is that it contains lipids that remain solid at room temperature. Biocompatible substances such as triglycerides, fatty acids, steroids and biowaxes are often used to prepare SLN systems. Due to their small sizes and large surface area, SLN are suitable to be covered with functionalized ligands moieties, antibody and other functional group (19). SLNs can be orally administered as aqueous dispersions or in the dosage forms of capsules, tablets, and pellets (20). Among the different types of nanocarriers, SLN are at the forefront of the potential application in oral drug delivery systems (21). SLN have many advantages like easy manufacturing, the stability of pharmaceuticals, increased drug content, effective release of drug and high long-term stability. Additionally In terms of drug delivery, SLN system can efficiently encapsulate antitumor drugs and other substances with poor water-solubility due to its high lipid content (22).",

            "text": "Similar to polymers, the properties of LNP can be tuned by choosing different lipids and stabilizers or stabilizer mixtures, but in contrast to polymers, these small-molecule building blocks can be excreted via the kidneys. 18,19 LNP formulations are becoming increasingly important in drug delivery not only due to their potential to deliver hydrophobic compounds within their core. They are further able to complex genetic material such as different types of RNA, if, for example, a potentially cationic stabilizer is added for complexation of the latter. 20 Stabilizers can, depending on the nature of their hydrophilic, ionic, or ionizable head groups, further provide tissue or organ selectivity, 21 regulate biocompatibility 13,22 and release properties. Receptor-targeting molecules can be attached to enable accumulation of the particles in specific cell types or tissues, and the protein adsorption pattern of the particle can be influenced. 23 The choice of the core-forming lipid, on the other hand, can influence particle stability. For example, a lipid with a melting point below body temperature can form a particle with a solid core and, therefore, higher stability (solid lipid nanoparticle, SLNP). 16 If shorter degradation times are desired, choosing a liquid lipid may be of advantage. 24 If the melting point of the lipid is close to body temperature, the stability of the particles may even change at a target location (temperature-responsiveness). 19 Replacing the pure lipid with a lipid mixture in the case of solid lipid nanoparticles helps to prevent expulsion of the stabilizer, which can occur upon crystallization of the lipid. 25 LNP sizes are dependent on both the stabilizer and the ratio of all compounds used in the formulation, and their internal structures can be complex, especially if genetic material is encapsulated. 20,26 odern LNP formulations that are used for, e.g., the encapsulation of mRNA-based vaccines, are comprised of a tailor-made mixture of lipids and stabilizers. 27,28 Ionic or ionizable stabilizers and phospholipids are needed for particle integrity and encapsulation of the payload.",

            "text": "Nanotechnology for nanomedicine development employs functional materials with appropriate nanoscale organization that can interact with biological systems and induce desired physiological responses while minimizing undesirable side effects [60]. Nanotechnology-based delivery systems can influence drug capacity to cross the biological barriers (e.g., the BBB) and reach the targeted brain regions [58][59][60][61]. Therefore, nanocarriers are promising for the development of personalized medicines for the treatment of neurological disorders [62][63][64][65][66][67]. \n\nLipid-based nanoparticles, including solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNPs), nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC), liposomes and liquid crystalline nanocarriers (LCN), as well as polymer-based nanoparticles (Figure 3), have been developed to overcome the poor solubility, stability, and bioavailability of curcumin, and to promote its utilization as a drug in disease treatments . Lipid-based nanoparticles have the advantage of being the least toxic carriers for in vivo applications. The lipids used to prepare biocompatible and biodegradable nanoparticles are usually naturally-occurring molecules with low acute and chronic toxicity. In the case of polymeric nanoparticles, the in vivo degradation of the polymer matrices might cause toxic effects [94]. The biocompatibility and the physico-chemical diversity of lipids and their capacity to enhance the oral bioavailability of drugs have made this kind of nanocarriers very attractive systems for drug delivery. As a matter of fact, lipid-based formulations may positively influence drug absorption in several ways, e.g., by influencing the solubilization properties, preventing the drug precipitation upon intestinal dilution, increasing the membrane permeability, inhibiting the efflux transporters, reducing the CYP enzymes, or enhancing the lymphatic transport [94,122]. \n\nAmong the lipid-based nanoparticles, SLNPs have been intensively developed because they combine the advantages of different carrier systems like liposomes and polymeric particles.",

            "text": "The advent of ionizable lipids made it possible to develop pharmacologically useful lipid formulations 11 . Specifically, pH-titratable lipids are almost entirely uncharged at the physiological pH of blood but positively charged at the acidic pH of endosomes. These features enable these lipid carriers to interact with negatively charged RNAs and endosomal membranes but prevent disadvantageous rapid clearance and low tolerability. Cationic or ionizable lipids with poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG)-lipids and helper lipids constitute the main components of lipid nanovehicles used for RNA delivery. PEG-lipids contribute to drug formulation stability during the production process and can shield the surface of lipid nanovehicles from blood components to optimize their pharmacokinetics and biodistribution. Helper lipids mainly facilitate lipid nanovehicles to escape from endosomes. \n\nWith the development of preparation technology, lipid nanovehicles have been developed from conventional lipoplexes to stabilized nucleic acid-lipid particles (SNALPs), lipopolyplexes, membrane/core nanoparticles (MCNPs), and lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). Therefore, in this review, lipid nanovehicles specifically include lipoplexes, SNALPs, lipopolyplexes, MCNPs, and LNPs. In contrast to classical hollow liposomes, lipopolyplexes, MCNPs, and LNPs contain a solid internal core that encapsulates RNA molecules, and therefore, they show higher kinetic stability and more rigid morphology. In particular, homogeneous LNPs are obtained by large-scale commercial fabrication methods such as T-mixing or microfluidic-mixing technology. Accordingly, LNPs are the most advanced lipid nanovehicles to deliver RNAs developed to date 12 .",

            "text": "Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) are a system similar to liposomes but differ in their lipid aggregation status [17]. Solid lipid nanoparticles have spherical shapes with a diameter of 50-1000 nm. The essential ingredients for the manufacture of SLN are lipids that are in a solidstate at room temperature, emulsifiers, active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) and a suitable solvent system. The advantages of SLN over liposomes are 1) avoiding the use of organic solvents; 2) has good reproducibility and allows it to be produced on a large scale; 3) enhances stability due to its rigid lipid matrix; 4) has a large entrapment efficiency against hydrophobic drugs; 5) has the ability for controlled release. This SLN changes the dimensions of drug delivery by combining the advantages of microemulsions, liposomes and polymeric nanoparticles. This SLN can also be used intravenously because an aqueous solution or aqueous surfactant can be dispersed spontaneously [66]. The small particle size is also the key to delivering the drug to the target. The size of solid lipid nanoparticles <10 nm will be able to diffuse into the blood capillaries, the size of 10-100 nm can deliver drugs into the lymphatic capillaries by convection, while the dimensions of 100-200 nm its ability to diffuse rapidly has decreased [67]. \n\nThe critical elements that determine the efficiency of delivery include particle size, surface charge, PEGylation, and surface modification by the target ligand [67]. Solid lipid nanoparticles can undergo phagocytic uptake, which can be minimized by surface modification. Cyclodextrins are widely used to increase solubility in water, increase bioavailability and improve physicochemical properties of drugs with their inclusion complexes. The addition of a cyclodextrin inclusion complex to the SLNs will improve the drug release profile of the system. Liquid SLN stability is also good. Aqueous SLN is stable for 3 y of storage. The tendency of SLN to gel formation related to long storage and light exposure can be overcome by lipid modification [66].",

NLCs were developed to solve the drawbacks of SLNs. Therefore, NLCs vary from SLNs by the feature of being smaller in size, better shelf-life stability, and better drug loading capacity [22]. \n\nNLCs are composed of a blend of solid lipids and liquid lipids in a suitable proportion. Presence of liquid lipids in solid matrix provide immobilization of drug and prevent the particle aggregation, due to solid matrix and therefore, inhibit expulsion of the drug [23,24]. Besides, the presence of liquid lipids increases the lipid matrix imperfections that lead to higher drug entrapment as compared to SLNs [18,25,26]. \n\nNLC can improve and enhance the oral bioavailability of loaded drugs by one or more of the following mechanisms: \n\n(1) The mucoadhesion properties of NLCs to the intestinal wall; \n\n(2) Emulsifying properties of surfactants used in formulation improve the permeability and solubility of the drug through the gastrointestinal tract membrane; (3) The nanosize of NLCs contributes to the enterocyte's surface to increase. Consequently, improve and enhance drug permeability across the intestinal membrane [27,28].",

The ideal drug delivery system needs to be study their biological and physio-chmical properties. Nanoparticles based drug delivery systems such as solid-lipids, liposomes, dendrimers, noisome, protein, polymeric, and polysaccharide nanoparticles are considered as effective approach for the treatment of chronic human diseases (Duan et al., 2020). Due to their various advantages as a carrier and drug delivery vehicle, solid-lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) have attracted worldwide (Jumaa and M\u00fcller, 2000). Phospholipids are important constituents of lipid and lipid-based drug delivery systems due to their amphiphilic nature, bio-compatibility, and multifunctionality. SLNs are commonly spherical shaped with an average diameter of 50-1,000 nm. SLNs are formulated with the ingredients of lipids, emulsifiers, active pharmaceutical ingredients and solvent systems. The preparation of SLNs does not require the need of any organic solvents. The rigid hardcore lipid matrix provides stability and bio-degradability to SLNs. Apart, SLNs provide better entrapment efficiency for hydrophobic drugs, have greater ability of controlled release and targeting ligands. Since, the organic solvents are not required for the synthesis of SLNs, it can provide tremendous reproducibility, feasibility of large-scale production, costeffective, and can adopt during high-pressure homogenization method (Gohla and Dingler, 2001). Unlike polymeric nanomaterials, the lipid core matter of SLNs is physiological and biodegradable which can provide better bio-compatibility and bio-availability. Whereas the polymeric nanomaterials may accumulate unwantedly in the liver, spleen, etc., (Schwarz, 1999).\n\nLiposomes are vital biological nanomaterials that have been reported for various applications over a long period of time. Naturally, they pose nano scale properties, structurally similar to bio-film, excellent bio-compatibility, and sought-after drug delivery systems.

Moreover, LNPs can overcome many biological obstacles (Kim et al., 2018), thus attracting increasing attention of the researchers day by day (Garc\u00eda-Pinelet al.), (Tang et al., 2018). In addition to their potential to cross various physiological barriers, these nanocarriers can be functionalized with several targeting moieties to enhance penetration across the barriers (Olusanya, Haj Ahmad, Ibegbu, Smith, Elkordy), (Riaz et al., 2018). Furthermore, temperature dependent self-assembly of lipid molecules, termed as thermo-responsive LNPs (TLNs), have served to enhance the drug permeability across the blood brain barrier (BBB) with potential to target glioblastoma cells (Rehman et al., 2017a). (See section 2 for suitability of lipid nanotheranostic system). \n\nAmong several LNPs, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs), lipid nanocapsules (LNCs), liposomes, and coreshell lipid nanoparticles (CLNs) have been widely explored in recent years. Specifically, SLNs and NLCs have shown promising potential as oral drug carriers anticipated to help the scientists planning to conduct studies on lipid-based nanocarriers (Okur et al., 2020). Ample studies aren't present regarding in vivo analysis of different aspects of NLCs as they have recently joined the plethora of lipid nanocarriers (Feitosa, Geraldes, Beraldo-de-Ara\u00fajo, Costa, Oliveira-Nascimento). \n\nSLNs corresponding to the colloidal drug delivery method comprise of a solid-lipid core that retains its solid phase at both, room and body temperatures.

However, the high risk of fouling compromises its reliability for continuous operation. Researchers reported an ultrasound-assisted processing method for the precipitation of LNPs in a micro-\ue104uidic mixer. Nanoparticles can be produced over several hours without clogging. Thus, this in-process ultrasonication is effective at improving the reliability of micro\ue104uidic precipitation and preventing the buildup of precipitates in the channels (Fig. 10A). 381 To boost the productivity of LNPs in micro\ue104uidics, obtaining a high concentration of LNPs is an alternative strategy. However, high concentration of lipids makes it difficult to control the size and dispersity of LNPs. Researchers developed a micro\ue104uidic device named iLiNP in which a simple baffle mixer structure can achieve rapid ethanol dilution. \n\nCompared with other micro\ue104uidic devices, iLiNP could produce smaller and more concentrated LNPs with good dispersity.

Using this approach, production rates of greater than 10 g h \u22121 can readily be achieved, demonstrating that the use of the MIVR is a viable method of producing hybrid nanoparticles in clinically relevant quantities. 383 LPH NPs are capable of delivering a wide range of therapeutic compounds in a controlled manner.",

Besides, LNPs have potential to be efficient mRNA delivery platforms. These nanoparticles are composed of multiple lipid components such as ionizable amine lipid, phospholipid, cholesterol, and PEG lipid. Among them, ionizable amine lipids have main role in endosomal escape of nucleic acid. Several studies have been done regarding vaccine technology based mRNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles for many infectious diseases including HIV, CMV, rabies, influenza, zika, and most recently COVID-19 (Alberer et al., 2017;John et al., 2018;Sahin et al., 2020). For instance, Elia et al., in 2021, fabricated an mRNA-based vaccine by use of LNPs-encapsulated SAR-S-CoV-2 human Fc-conjugated receptor binding domain (RBD-hFc). Various ionizable lipids have been assessed in vivo in a luciferase (luc) mRNA reporter assay, and two leading LNPs formulations have been selected for the subsequent RBD-hFc mRNA vaccine technology. The data in the current research show that these nanoparticles possess the potential to be employed in LNP-based mRNA vaccines technology against COVID-19.",

            "text": "PEGylated lipids, or PEG-lipids, represent important components that are usually located on the surface of the LNPs. PEG-lipids consist of a hydrophilic molecule of PEG conjugated to a hydrophobic alkyl (or lipid) chain, where the PEG domain is attached to the LNP surface while the alkyl chain is attached to the LNP bilayer. The incorporation of PEGylated lipids in LNPs is known to extend the circulation time of LNPs due to their steric barrier effect. This property reduces binding of LNPs to plasma proteins (opsonins), reduces rapid elimination by the reticuloendothelial system, and consequently, assists in the accumulation of the nanoparticles at disease sites [25,49]. In addition, the steric barrier properties of PEGylated lipids may prevent fusion or aggregation of nanoparticles during manufacturing, and this would result in a homogenous formulation with a small particle size (50-100 nm) and narrow polydispersity index [25]. \n\nThe amount of PEGylated lipids incorporated in LNPs should be controlled carefully and kept to a minimum. Having higher PEG contents usually increases the residence time of LNPs in the blood circulation but may prevent their fusion with the endosomal bilayer and hinder the intracellular delivery of nucleic acids [68,69]. Therefore, a reduction in PEG content from 10% to about 1.5% (along with increasing the ionizable lipids to 57%) produced a marked improvement in the potency of mRNA-based LNPs as reported by Semple et al. [64]. Moreover, monitoring the size of PEG-lipids attached to the LNPs can be used to control the rate at which the PEG-lipids diffuse away from the nanoparticles and affect the residence time in blood circulation. Larger lipid anchors are usually used in formulating liposomes that circulate for longer duration in the blood to deliver chemotherapeutic drugs [70]. On the other hand, smaller lipid anchors are used in developing LNPs that favor shorter residence times to deliver siRNA to hepatocytes [71].",

            "text": "When comparing the advantages and disadvantages of different types of nanomaterial platforms for drug delivery, lipid-based nanoparticles, including liposomes, present several advantages.They are biocompatible, biodegradable, and can encapsulate both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs with a high loading capacity.They also enable controlled drug release and can be tailored for specific properties.However, conventional liposomes are quickly cleared from the bloodstream, limiting their effectiveness.This limitation has led to the development of stealth liposomes with extended circulation time.Additionally, although strategies like receptor targeting and stimuli-responsive drug release enhance their efficacy, another limitation is the possibility of leakage and fusion of encapsulated drug/molecules [60,116].\n\nSLNs offer stability in aqueous environments, controlled drug release, and versatility in administration routes.They have shown promise in enhancing the efficacy of various anticancer drugs [42].NLCs, the second generation of lipid nanoparticles, address limitations of SLNs, such as restricted drug loading and potential for drug leakage, by using a combination of solid and liquid lipids [117].\n\nIn comparison, polymer-based platforms, including polymer-drug conjugates, polymeric micelles, and dendrimers, offer ease of synthesis, high stability, controlled drug release, and low toxicity [118].Polymer-drug conjugates can enhance pharmacokinetic properties and reduce side effects [119].Polymeric micelles possess advantages over other polymeric drug carriers due to their inherent self-assembly properties, making them easier to fabricate [120].Dendrimers, while versatile, can be toxic to normal cells due to their strong interaction with cell membranes [121].\n\nNanocrystals offer benefits such as enhanced bioavailability and water solubility of drugs, and high drug-loading capacity.However, challenges include an incomplete understanding of structure-function relationships, the difficulty in achieving an adjustable dosage range, and the lack of standardized characterization methods [88].Inorganic nanoparticles, like gold and silver nanoparticles, offer high stability and reduced drug leakage, making them suitable for drug delivery.",

            "text": "Animal model studies have shown that a decrease of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the striatum led to the loss of motor functions characterized by PD [45]. QDs are smaller nanoparticles typically made from a combination of metals and metalloids. QDs can also be made from organic materials such as graphene. QDs are mostly employed in bioanalytical applications, biological detection, and diagnosis, due to photoactivity and semi conductivity. The therapeutic applications of QDs are less explored. Some have reported the application of QDs as photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy (PDT) [46,47]. The generation of reactive oxygen species that are suspected of promoting neurodegeneration is typical during the PDT procedure, blocking the broad application of PDT [48]. To our knowledge, studies investigating the biodegradability of inorganic nanoparticles mainly focus on systemic clearance. Investigations into their distribution and long-term toxicity in the brain are essential for their deployment for therapeutic applications against neurodegenerative diseases. \n\nCompared to inorganic nanoparticles, lipid and polymeric nanoparticles are inherently more biocompatible. In addition to the advantages over inorganic NPs, lipids and polymer nanoparticle surfaces can also be modified to impart desired functionalities. Natural polymer nanoparticles are generally less toxic and more biodegradable compared to synthetic polymers. The degradation of synthetic polymers can lead to increased toxicity. Without modifications, the hydrophobicity of some polymeric systems limits their application to the delivery of hydrophilic drugs. Hydrogels, on the other hand, are hydrophilic and thus are incompatible with hydrophobic drugs. If a controlled/long-term drug release is desired, polymeric nanoparticle systems are not recommended due to the burst release effect. The use of toxic organic solvents to produce polymer nanoparticle systems is sometimes unavoidable, thus limiting scalability. While most inorganic nanoparticle systems are used for diagnosis, several reports have demonstrated the use of lipid-based nanoparticle systems for therapeutic applications.",

Their primary advantage is the improvement of the bioavailability of drugs, specifically lipophilic molecules that can be better solubilized in the lipid core than in aqueous environments. The lipophilic core of lipid nanoparticles entraps active ingredients, while the surfactant membrane, generally consisting solely or partially of phospholipids, ensures the stability of LNP in hydrophilic environment. LNP are particularly well suited for transdermal drug delivery. Indeed, lipid nanoparticles are known to create a mono-layer film on the skin, limiting water evaporation and improving skin hydration [16].",

            "text": "As mentioned earlier, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) have a key weakness in limited drug loading capacity. 124 To address this challenge, researchers have introduced the second generation of SLNs, known as nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs), which incorporate both solid and liquid lipids in their cores, resulting in a more disordered lipid structure. This structural characteristic allows for higher drug loading capacity and improved drug release kinetics compared to SLNs. 125,126 he ratio between solid lipid (e.g., cetyl palmitate), liquid oil (e.g., caprylic triglyceride), and surfactant (e.g., polysorbate 80) plays a critical role in determining the entrapment efficiency and stability of therapeutic agents in vivo. 127 NLCs can be modified with ligands or polymers for targeted delivery of hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs. 79 As efficient carriers, RNA-and pDNA-loaded NLCs enable gene therapy and personalized medicine, modulating gene expression, and delivering therapeutic proteins. These lipid-based nanoparticles offer versatile platforms for nucleic-acid\u2212based therapies to treat genetic diseases and cancers. \n\nMD simulations offer valuable insights into the physicochemical properties and behavior of NLCs. 74 For instance, the self-assembly behavior of mixed NLC systems containing Rhodamine, Miglyol 812, Tween 80, and Gelucire 44/14 was investigated by using MD simulations. 128 The results demonstrated that raising the temperature to 358 K improved the stability of the NLCs, leading to enhanced component compaction. Furthermore, this study has shown that adding oil to the lipid formulation creates an imperfect core, effectively increasing the drug loading capacity of the NLCs. \n\nNLCs offer advantages over other LNP formulations such as improved drug-loading capacity, controlled release, and enhanced stability for drug delivery. 129,126 They are biocompatible and biodegradable, making them ideal drug carriers. NLCs have shown promise in increasing oral drug availability and have been studied in clinical trials for various pharmaceuticals, including COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, anticancer agents, antioxidants, and antiviral agents 127,130\u2212132 (Table 1).",

            "text": "Ionizable lipid-based LNPs were formulated using a microfluidic mixing device, following a previously established protocol [38 ]. The formulation comprised ionizable lipid, helper lipid (DSPC), cholesterol, and a PEG-lipid conjugate (DMG-PEG20 0 0) with a molar ratio of 50:10:38.5:1.5 (Fig. 1 B) [38 ]. We used Firefly luciferase (Fluc) mRNA to   measure the efficiency of in vitro and in vivo delivery [38 ,40 ]. We examined various weight ratios of ionizable lipid to mRNA ranging from 2:1 to 20:1. The encapsulation efficiency and drug (mRNA) loading capacity are used as important criteria for evaluating the quality of LNPs. Encapsulation efficiency signifies the ratio of RNA enclosed within lipid nanoparticles to the total RNA within the LNP solution, whereas a high encapsulation efficiency indicates a low presence of free mRNA in the prepared LNP solution. On the other hand, drug loading efficiency measures the proportion of RNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles concerning the RNA input during the preparation process. Consequently, a high drug loading efficiency reflects a relatively minor loss of mRNA in LNP throughout the preparation process. At ionizable lipid to mRNA weight ratios exceeding 2:1, the encapsulation efficiency of LNPs generated from three HTO lipids and SM-102 all surpassed 70% (Fig. 1 C). Notably, the drug (mRNA) loading efficiency of HTO LNP is superior to that of SM-102 (Fig. 1 D). Furthermore, it was observed that LNPs exhibited negative surface charges at neutral pH, potentially due to the presence of negatively charged mRNA molecules ( Table S1) [18 ,41 ]. The molecular dynamics simulations suggested that the presence of more hydroxyl groups in HTO lipids could form more hydrogen bonds with mRNA than SM-102 (Fig. 1 E and F). These interactions may enhance the binding affinity between lipid and mRNA, thereby reducing the loss of mRNA during LNP preparation.",

            "text": "Despite constituting the smallest molar percentage of lipids in LNPs, typically around 1.5 mol%, PEG-lipids exert a substantial impact on the critical properties of LNPs. Specifically, they localize on the surface of lipid particles and maintain the spatial stability of the delivery system. Furthermore, the presence of PEG chains prevents LNP aggregation, serum protein adsorption, and uptake by the mononuclear phagocytic system in vivo, thereby prolonging the circulating half-life of LNPs in the bloodstream [54,55]. Alternatively, extended circulation times lead to a higher number of nanoparticles interacting with the blood-brain barrier. Importantly, the size of LNPs must be carefully controlled during preparation, as it plays a pivotal role in determining their pharmacokinetics, delivery efficiency, and transfection efficacy. Studies have shown that increasing the molar ratio of PEG-lipids results in significantly smaller LNPs, independent of other lipid components [56,57]. These findings underscore the importance of optimizing the PEG-lipid ratio to achieve the desired size and functionality of LNPs. Moreover, beyond their influence on structural properties such as size and stability, variations in the molar ratio and composition of PEG-lipids also markedly affect the biodistribution and cellular interaction of LNPs, which are critical in determining the efficiency of cargo delivery to target cells [58]. PEGylated polymeric nanocarriers were developed by Nance and colleagues for the targeted delivery of the anticancer drug paclitaxel (PTX) to brain tissues. They demonstrated that PEGylation significantly enhanced the brain-targeting ability of the nanocarriers, improving PTX delivery to brain regions compared to uncoated polymeric nanocarriers [59]. Therefore, the careful optimization of these parameters is essential to create a balanced LNP structure that maximizes the therapeutic potential of PEGylated lipids. In conclusion, PEGylated lipids serve a crucial role in enhancing the stability, tissue penetration, and targeting efficiency of LNPs as drug delivery systems. These advancements in PEGylation strategies offer significant potential for developing precise and efficient delivery platforms.",

Multiple biomedical products, such as controlled release depots and absorbable sutures, already incorporate polymers, laying a foundation for successful clinical translation, and their properties can be controlled using chemical synthesis to produce efficacious delivery systems 5,6 . Collectively, lipid and polymer nanoparticles represent the largest share of non-viral systems studied for nucleic acid delivery.\n\nIn this Review, we discuss recent advances in the engineering of lipid and polymer nanoparticles for the delivery of genetic drugs to specific organs and cell types in the body. Other approaches and materials have been excellently summarized elsewhere [7][8][9][10] . Genetic drugs based on nucleic acid biomolecules must reach the cytosol of target cells while avoiding bystander cells, which necessitates the design of tissue-targeted delivery systems. As cell-based assays can be a poor predictor of in vivo performance, we limit our scope to delivery systems whose organ-targeting properties have been validated in animal models 11 . Although we emphasize targeting specific organs and cell types via intravenous (i.v.) administration, alternative modes of administration can also be used to control the biological fate of a delivery system 12 . Three mechanisms, passive, active and endogenous targeting (Box 1), are leveraged to engineer nanoparticles that reach specific organs through the vascular network. Delivery using passive and active targeting has been extensively investigated for decades. However, endogenous targeting represents an emerging paradigm based on a growing understanding of how the protein corona impacts delivery. The examples we provide highlight mechanisms for organ-specific delivery of genetic drugs, but we anticipate that these Review article that appears to depend on the choice of nucleic acid cargo, the lipid composition of the LNP, formulation method and processing 23 .\n\nThe structure and properties of LNPs depend on both the chemistry of the constituent lipids and their molar proportions. Thus, it is important to understand the function of each lipid in an LNP, identify or synthesize appropriate lipid molecules to execute those functions and test the efficacy of different LNP chemical compositions and combinations in vivo 24 . Optimization of the chemistry of the ionizable cationic lipid component of LNPs has been the focus of extensive efforts 15 . A",

They are applied in many areas of medicine with one of them being drug delivery. Nanoparticles have a number of advantages as drug carriers which include reduced toxic effects, increased bioavailability, and their ability to be modified for specific tissues or cells. Due to the exciting development of nanotechnology concomitant with advances in biotechnology and medicine, the number of clinical trials devoted to nanoparticles for drug delivery is growing rapidly. Some nanoparticles, lipid-based types, in particular, played a crucial role in the developing and manufacturing of the two COVID-19 vaccines\u2014Pfizer and Moderna\u2014that are now being widely used. In this analysis, we provide a quantitative survey of clinical trials using nanoparticles during the period from 2002 to 2021 as well as the recent FDA-approved drugs (since 2016). A total of 486 clinical trials were identified using the clinicaltrials.gov database. The prevailing types of nanoparticles were liposomes (44%) and protein-based formulations (26%) during this period. The most commonly investigated content of the nanoparticles were paclitaxel (23%), metals (11%), doxorubicin (9%), bupivacaine and various vaccines (both were 8%). Among the FDA-approved nanoparticle drugs, polymeric (29%), liposomal (22%) and lipid-based (21%) drugs were the most common. In this analysis, we also discuss the differential development of the diverse groups of nanoparticles and their content, as well as the underlying factors behind the trends.",

Nanotechnology has made an important contribution to the development of effective vaccine adjuvants and delivery systems. LNP-based mRNA vaccines can protect the encapsulated mRNA from the host environment and release it continuously to induce a lasting immunostimulatory effect. Nanocarriers, including viral and non-viral carriers, have also been explored as potential tools in delivering vaccines because they are expected to elicit a wide range of immune responses in addition to cellmediated immunity (83). Nanomaterial delivery systems mainly include nanoemulsion-based adjuvants, lipid nanocarriers, and adjuvants targeting pattern recognition receptors (83). The use of nanomaterials as drug carriers is effective in the treatment of Currently, the main nanomaterials used to deliver mRNA vaccines are lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). LNPs constitute four components, including ionizable cationic lipids, lipid-linked polyethylene glycol, cholesterol, and naturally occurring phospholipids. The synthesis of LNPs is a crucial process, which directly affect the size and encapsulation efficiency of the LNPs. The crucial factor in the synthesis of fine and uniform LNPs is the rapid mixing of the excess water and ethanol-lipid phase. Using the staggered herringbone structure, microfluidic mixing is a selectable synthesis method, for the diverse-scale synthesis of LNPs (15). Once the mRNA vaccines enter the targeted cells, the process of their forming complexes with cationic lipids released is necessary for nucleic acid delivery. Through neutralizing the charge of their cationic lipid carriers, the cell's anionic lipids can help LNPs release nucleic acids, thereby disrupting the electrostatic interactions between the lipid carriers and nucleic acids (87, 88).",

Thus, the limitations in the pharmaceutical development of liposomes are focused mostly on quality assurance and cost. Quality assurance in the manufacturing of liposomes is focused on concerns related to both the manufacturing process and the stability of the formulation. These systems encounter challenges such as: (i) the scalability of the manufacturing process, (ii) the reliability and reproducibility of the final product, (iii) the absence of adequate equipment and/or in-house expertise, (iv) the potential for chemical instability or denaturation of the encapsulated compound during manufacturing, and (v) long-term stability issues [190]. Therefore, despite the plethora of encouraging results in research studies, as well as in preclinical studies, the clinical translation of liposomal drug delivery systems is slow. \n\nThese disadvantages of liposomes led to the development of other colloidal drug delivery systems, being used as efficient drug carriers for different delivery routes, such as solid lipid nanoparticles, nanostructured lipid carriers, polymeric nanoparticles, and other polymeric nanocarriers. These nanocarriers may overcome some of the drawbacks of liposomes, such as the high cost, potential vesicles' instability, limited encapsulation efficiency, and others. However, when introducing polymeric-and surfactant-based nanocarriers, caution should be taken regarding the safety profile of the polymers and surfactants used in the formulation.",

            "text": "The first generation of lipid-based nanosystems employed cationic liposomes to encapsulate and protect siRNA molecules. Cationic liposomes possess a positive charge, enabling electrostatic interaction with the negatively charged siRNA, forming stable complexes that facilitate cellular uptake and endosomal escape. One such example is the widely utilized lipofectamine-based system, which combines cationic lipids with siRNA, leading to efficient gene silencing [26]. However, these early lipid-based nanosystems revealed challenges such as poor stability, limited siRNA loading capacity, and potential cytotoxicity. \n\nTo overcome these limitations, the second generation of lipidic nanosystems introduced the concept of lipid nanoparticles LNPs. LNPs are comprised of a lipid bilayer encapsulating the siRNA payload and often contain additional components, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) and targeting ligands. These components enhance stability, circulation time, and specific delivery to the target cells or tissues. Notably, LNPs incorporating ionizable cationic lipids have shown remarkable success in siRNA delivery. For instance, the FDAapproved lipid nanoparticle system, Onpattro, utilizes an ionizable lipid formulation to effectively deliver siRNA targeting transthyretin (TTR) for the treatment of hereditary ATTR amyloidosis [27]. The second-generation lipidic nanosystems represent a significant advancement in siRNA delivery, addressing previous challenges and exhibiting improved therapeutic potential. Lipid nanoparticles act to reduce biological barriers to siRNA delivery, degradation by nuclease, and intracellular trafficking. LNPs may offer potential advantages including enhanced bioavailability, increasing aqueous solubility to reduce cellular clearance time, improving receptor specificity, and targeting drugs to exact tissue. \n\nLNPs fabricated using well-tolerated components can be prepared on a large scale and can be sterilized and lyophilized, providing storage stability. They are also biocompatible and biodegradable, similarly to liposomes. The LNPs are composed mainly of phospholipids, organized in a bi-layered structure.",

[1] While oligonucleotides can be chemically modified to enhance their \"drug-likeness\", and are often administered naked or conjugated with targeting motifs (e.g., N-acetylgalactosamine), larger nucleic acids (NAs) such as mRNA typically require encapsulation inside a nanocarrier to facilitate their intracellular delivery. [2] Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have emerged as clinically relevant drug delivery systems for NAs owing to their ease of manufacturing, high NA loading efficiencies and generally good safety profile. [3] However, the LNP field currently faces two obstacles that are slowing down its advancement. 2a,4] Second, LNPs have been linked to unwanted immune reactions and accelerated blood clearance after repeated administrations, underlining the need for the development of safer and more efficacious LNP formulations. [5] xtracellular vesicles (EVs), which are naturally occurring cellproduced vesicles, may offer a promising avenue to address some of the limitations of LNPs. [6] They transport biomolecules such as proteins and NAs through the extracellular space, serving as important mediators of cell-cell communication. [7] Clinical trials with EVs (e.g., from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)) have highlighted their good tolerability, [6,8] and there is evidence that EVs can deliver NAs more safely and effectively compared to LNPs. [9] evertheless, achieving efficient loading of therapeutic NA doses into the lumen of small EVs (< 200 nm) remains challenging. \n\nGenetic manipulation of EV producer cell lines is a widely used method to introduce protein or NA-based cargo into EVs.

            "text": "In the golden age of pharmaceutical nanocarriers, we are witnessing a maturation stage of the original concepts and ideas. There is no doubt that nanoformulations are extremely valuable tools for drug delivery applications; the current challenge is how to optimize them to ensure that they are safe, effective and scalable, so that they can be manufactured at an industrial level and advance to clinical use. In this context, lipid nanoparticles have gained ground, since they are generally regarded as nontoxic, biocompatible and easy-to-produce formulations. Pharmaceutical applications of lipid nanocarriers are a burgeoning field for the transport and delivery of a diversity of therapeutic agents, from biotechnological products to small drug molecules. This review starts with a brief overview of the characteristics of solid lipid nanoparticles and discusses the relevancy of performing systematic preformulation studies. The main applications, as well as the advantages that this type of nanovehicles offers in certain therapeutic scenarios are discussed. Next, pharmacokinetic aspects are described, such as routes of administration, absorption after oral administration, distribution in the organism (including brain penetration) and elimination processes. Safety and toxicity issues are also addressed. Our work presents an original point of view, addressing the biopharmaceutical aspects of these nanovehicles by means of descriptive statistics of the state-of-the-art of solid lipid nanoparticles research. All the presented results, trends, graphs and discussions are based in a systematic (and reproducible) bibliographic search that considered only original papers in the subject, covering a 7 years range (2013-today), a period that accounts for more than 60% of the total number of publications in the topic in the main bibliographic databases and search engines. Focus was placed on the therapeutic fields of application, absorption and distribution processes and current efforts for the translation into the clinical practice of lipid-based nanoparticles. For this, the currently active clinical trials on lipid nanoparticles were reviewed, with a brief discussion on what achievements or milestones are still to be reached, as a way of understanding the reasons for the scarce number of solid lipid nanoparticles undergoing clinical trials.",

Factors such as low cost and high effectiveness, biocompatibility, potential to penetrate biological barriers, and stability in physiological conditions should be considered to facilitate nanoparticle production.\n\nResearch institutions and businesses should support scale-up efforts to bring their innovations in this area to market so that society may reap the full benefits of its many applications.

LNPs products must still adhere to all other industry requirements, such as using a clean room, specialized manufacturing equipment, machine authentication, flooring, safety, and employee instruction.

Hence, solid lipid nanoparticles hold great promise for reaching the goal of controlled and site specific drug delivery and hence have attracted wide attention of researchers. This review presents a broad treatment of solid lipid nanoparticles discussing their advantages, limitations and their possible remedies. The different types of nanocarriers which were based on solid lipid like solid lipid nanoparticles, nanostructured lipid carriers, lipid drug conjugates are discussed with their structural differences. Different production methods which are suitable for large scale production and applications of solid lipid nanoparticles are described. Appropriate analytical techniques for characterization of solid lipid nanoparticles like photon correlation spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry are highlighted. Aspects of solid lipid nanoparticles route of administration and their biodistribution are also incorporated. If appropriately investigated,solid lipid nanoparticles may open new vistas in therapy of complex diseases.",

Nanotechnology can also protect AMPs from degradation and increase their efficacy [233]. Nanoparticles range from 0.1 to 100 nm and can transport peptides across the intestinal barrier to enter the bloodstream [132,233]. Various nanomaterials used for the delivery of AMPs include metal nanoparticles (gold, silver), lipid nanoparticles (liposome), polymer nanoparticles [chitosan, hyaluronic acid, and poly(glycolide-co-lactide) or PLGA], and other nanostructures (dendrimer, carbon nanotube, and quantum dot), as shown in Figure 6 [234]. [235]. Lipid nanoparticles are biocompatible, which gives them the advantage of being used to avoid toxicity in tissues [236]. Polymeric nanoparticles contain a coating of molecules with specific properties such as antimicrobial activity and good bioavailability [237]. Forming other nanostructures helps combat complications, such as different structures, allowing biofilm inhibition [238]. Modified with permission from CC-BY 4.0 [235].

It is the leading cancer killer in both men and women in every Ethnic Group. A major problem associated with chemotherapies against their lung cancer is the lack of selective toxicity, which results in a narrow therapeutic index thereby compromising clinical prognosis. To circumvent these challenges, the present investigation sought to develop a docetaxel-loaded nanostructured lipid carrier system (DTX-NLCS) for the treatment of lung cancer. A 3-factor/3-level Box-Behnken Design was applied to systematically optimize the DTX-NLCS parameters. The amount of drug, emulsifier concentration, and homogenization speed was selected as independent variables, while the particle size and % entrapment efficiency (%EE) were selected as dependent variables. The optimized batch parameters were 29.81\u2009mg drug, 19.97% w/w emulsifier, and 13 200 (rpm) speed of homogenization with a mean particle size of 154.1\u2009\u00b1\u20093.13\u2009nm and a mean %EE of 86.12\u2009\u00b1\u20093.48%. The in vitro lipolysis experiments revealed that the optimized DTX-NLCs were stabilized by 10% w/w PEG 4000 mono-stearate and exhibited an anti-lipolytic effect. Furthermore, the in vitro gastrointestinal stability studies (at pH-1.2, pH-4.5, pH-6.8, and pH-7.4) revealed that the optimized developed system could withstand various GI tract media. The in vitro dissolution studies depicted a pH-independent controlled-release consistent with the Weibull model. In vitro cytotoxicity studies using NCI-H460 cell lines further revealed that there was a reduction in IC50 values in the DTX-NLCS treated cells as compared to those treated with the pure drug, indicating an improved efficiency for the developed system.

The urgent need for a vaccine has led to the development of various immunization approaches. mRNA vaccines represent a cell-free, simple, and rapid platform for immunization, and therefore have been employed in recent studies toward the development of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Herein, we present the design of an mRNA vaccine, based on lipid nanoparticles (LNPs)-encapsulated SARS-CoV-2 human Fc-conjugated receptor-binding domain (RBD-hFc). Several ionizable lipids have been evaluated in vivo in a luciferase (luc) mRNA reporter assay, and two leading LNPs formulations have been chosen for the subsequent RBD-hFc mRNA vaccine strategy. Intramuscular administration of LNP RBD-hFc mRNA elicited robust humoral response, a high level of neutralizing antibodies and a Th1-biased cellular response in BALB/c mice. The data in the current study demonstrate the potential of these lipids as promising candidates for LNP-based mRNA vaccines in general and for a COVID19 vaccine in particular."

Particularly, Solid Lipid Nanoparticles (SLNs) have emerged as promising nanocarriers in cancer therapy. SLNs offer remarkable advantages such as low toxicity, high bioavailability of drugs, versatility of incorporation of hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs, and feasibility of large-scale production. Their molecular structure is crucial to obtain high quality SLN preparations and it is determined by the relationship between the composition and preparation method. Additionally, SLNs allow overcoming several physiological barriers that hinder drug delivery to tumors and are also able to escape multidrug resistance mechanisms, characteristic of cancer cells. Focusing on cell delivery, SLNs can improve drug delivery to target cells by different mechanisms, such as passive mechanisms that take advantage of the tumor microenvironment, active mechanisms by surface modification of SLNs, and codelivery mechanisms. SLNs can incorporate many different drugs and have proven to be effective in different types of tumors (i.e., breast, lung, colon, liver, and brain), corroborating their potential. Finally, it has to be taken into account that there are still some challenges to face in the application of SLNs in anticancer treatments but their possibilities seem to be high."

This SLN changes the dimensions of drug delivery by combining the advantages of microemulsions, liposomes and polymeric nanoparticles. This SLN can also be used intravenously because an aqueous solution or aqueous surfactant can be dispersed spontaneously (Duan et al., 2020)."

This enables effective delivery of encapsulated compounds to target sites while minimizing systemic toxicity. Liposomes present as an attractive delivery system due to their flexible physicochemical and biophysical properties, which allow easy manipulation to address different delivery considerations. Despite considerable research in the last 50 years and the plethora of positive results in preclinical studies, the clinical translation of liposome assisted drug delivery platforms has progressed incrementally. In this review, we will discuss the advances in liposome assisted drug delivery, biological challenges that still remain, and current clinical and experimental use of liposomes for biomedical applications. The translational obstacles of liposomal technology will also be presented.",

Currently in the spotlight as vital components of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, LNPs play a key role in effectively protecting and transporting mRNA to cells. Liposomes, an early version of LNPs, are a versatile nanomedicine delivery platform. A number of liposomal drugs have been approved and applied to medical practice. Subsequent generations of lipid nanocarriers, such as solid lipid nanoparticles, nanostructured lipid carriers, and cationic lipid-nucleic acid complexes, exhibit more complex architectures and enhanced physical stabilities. With their ability to encapsulate and deliver therapeutics to specific locations within the body and to release their contents at a desired time, LNPs provide a valuable platform for treatment of a variety of diseases. Here, we present a landscape of LNP-related scientific publications, including patents and journal articles, based on analysis of the CAS Content Collection, the largest human-curated collection of published scientific knowledge. Rising trends are identified, such as nanostructured lipid carriers and solid lipid nanoparticles becoming the preferred platforms for numerous formulations. Recent advancements in LNP formulations as drug delivery platforms, such as antitumor and nucleic acid therapeutics and vaccine delivery systems, are discussed. Challenges and growth opportunities are also evaluated in other areas, such as medical imaging, cosmetics, nutrition, and agrochemicals. This report is intended to serve as a useful resource for those interested in LNP nanotechnologies, their applications, and the global research effort for their development."

SLNs have attracted increasing attention in recent years for delivering drugs, nucleic acids, proteins, peptides, nutraceuticals, and cosmetics. These nanocarriers have attracted industrial attention due to their ease of preparation, physicochemical stability, and scalability. These characteristics make SLNs attractive for manufacture on a large scale. Currently, several products with SLNs are in clinical trials, and there is a high possibility that SLN carriers will quickly increase their presence in the market. A large-scale manufacturing unit is required for commercial applications to prepare enough formulations for clinical studies. Furthermore, continuous processing is becoming more popular in the pharmaceutical sector to reduce product batch-to-batch differences. This review paper discusses some conventional methods and the rationale for large-scale production. It further covers recent progress in scale-up methods for the synthesis of SLNs, including high-pressure homogenization (HPH), hot melt extrusion coupled with HPH, microchannels, nanoprecipitation using static mixers, and microemulsion-based methods. These scale-up technologies enable the possibility of commercialization of SLNs. Furthermore, ongoing studies indicate that these technologies will eventually reach the pharmaceutical market.",

The size of the nanoparticles can also be effectively controlled using microfluidic devices (Kimura et al., 2020)...Furthermore, LNPs can easily fulfill three requirements for nucleic acid delivery vehicles: efficient encapsulation to resist degradation by nucleases, a mechanism for targeted delivery and intracellular entry, and a manufacturing process that allows for the mass production of uniformly sized nanoparticles (2017).",

After preparation of LNPs, the organic solvent injection method needs some post-treatments, such as overnight dialysis or direct dilution with a buffer solution. LNP production using the microfluidic-based organic solvent injection method is dominated by kinetics rather than thermodynamics. Kinetics of ethanol removal from the inner and outer membranes of LNPs could induce a structural change in the membrane that could lead to fusion of LNPs. However, the effects of microfluidic post-treatment on the final size of LNPs have not been sufficiently understood. Herein, we investigated the effect of the post-treatment processes on the final product size of LNPs in detail. A simple baffle device and a model lipid system composed of a neutral phospholipid (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, POPC) and cholesterol were used to produce the LNPs. We demonstrated that flow conditions of the post-treatment diluting the remaining ethanol in the LNP suspension affected the final product size of LNPs. Based on the findings, we developed an integrated baffle device composed of an LNP production region and a post-treatment region for a microfluidic-based LNP production system; this integrated baffle device prevented the undesirable aggregation or fusion of POPC LNPs even for the high-lipid-concentration condition. Finally, we applied our concept to small interfering RNA (siRNA) delivery and confirmed that no significant effects due to the continuous process occurred on the siRNA encapsulation efficiency, biological distribution, and knockdown activity. The microfluidic post-treatment method is expected to contribute to the production of LNPs for practical applications and the development of novel LNP-based nanomedicines.",

Nucleic acid particles need to be small, stable and functional in terms of selective cell uptake and controlled release of encapsulated nucleic acids. Here we report on small (\u223c38 nm) monomolecular nucleic acid/lipid particles (mNALPs) that contain single molecules of short double-stranded oligonucleotides covered by a tight, highly curved lipid bilayer. The particles consist of DOPE, DOTAP, DOPC and DSPE-PEG(2000) and are assembled with 21 bp double-stranded DNA or small interfering RNA by solvent exchange on a hydrodynamic-focusing microfluidic chip. In comparison to vortex mixing by hand this method increases the encapsulation efficiency by 20%, and yields particles with a narrower size distribution, negligible aggregate formation and high stability in blood plasma and serum. Modification of mNALPs with folate-conjugated PEG-lipids results in specific binding and uptake by epithelial carcinoma KB cells overexpressing folate receptors. Binding is significantly reduced by competitive inhibition using free folate and is not observed with non-targeted mNALPs, revealing high specificity. The functionalized mNALPs show gene silencing in the presence of chloroquine, an endosome-destabilizing agent. Together, the robust self-assembly of small-sized mNALPs with their high stability and receptor-specific cell uptake demonstrate that the tight, PEG-grafted lipid-bilayer encapsulation may offer a promising approach towards the delivery of short double-stranded oligonucleotides."

Intracellular delivery of NWs without compromising cellular integrity and metabolic activity has, however, proven difficult without external mechanical forces or electrical pulses. Here, we introduce a biomimetic approach in which a cell penetrating peptide, the trans-activating transcriptional activator (TAT) from human immunodeficiency virus 1, is linked to the surface of Si NWs to facilitate spontaneous internalization of NWs into primary neuronal cells. Confocal microscopy imaging studies at fixed time points demonstrate that TAT-conjugated NWs (TAT-NWs) are fully internalized into mouse hippocampal neurons, and quantitative image analyses reveal an ca. 15% internalization efficiency. In addition, live cell dynamic imaging of NW internalization shows that NW penetration begins within 10-20 min after binding to the membrane and that NWs become fully internalized within 30-40 min. The generality of cell penetrating peptide modification method is further demonstrated by internalization of TAT-NWs into primary dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons.",

Thus, three main categories of linkers will be highlighted, forming either disulfide acid-sensitive or stimuli-sensitive bonds.

To overcome these issues, the use of microfluidic techniques in the production of LBNPs has sharply increased over the past two years. Microfluidics overcomes many of the pitfalls seen with conventional production methods, leading to reproducible LBNPs at lower costs and higher yields. In this review, the use of microfluidics in the preparation of various types of LBNPs, including liposomes, lipid nanoparticles, and solid lipid nanoparticles for the delivery of small molecules, oligonucleotides, and peptide/protein drugs is summarized. Various microfluidic parameters, as well as their effects on the physicochemical properties of LBNPs, are also discussed.",

In fact, LNPs are currently being used in the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. Cationic LNPs composed of 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP)/cholesterol (chol) LNPs have been classified as one of the most efficient gene delivery systems and are being tested in numerous clinical trials. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of the molar ratio of DOTAP/chol, PEGylation, and lipid to mRNA ratio on mRNA transfection, and explore the applications of DOTAP/chol LNPs in pDNA and oligonucleotide transfection. Here we showed that PEGylation significantly decreased mRNA transfection efficiency of DOTAP/chol LNPs. Among non-PEGylated LNP formulations, 1:3 molar ratio of DOTAP/chol in DOTAP/chol LNPs showed the highest mRNA transfection efficiency. Furthermore, the optimal ratio of DOTAP/chol LNPs to mRNA was tested to be 62.5 \u00b5M lipid to 1 \u03bcg mRNA. More importantly, these mRNA-loaded nanoparticles were stable for 60 days at 4 \u00b0C storage without showing reduction in transfection efficacy. We further found that DOTAP/chol LNPs were able to transfect pDNA and oligonucleotides, demonstrating the ability of these LNPs to transport the cargo into the cell nucleus. The influence of various factors in the formulation of DOTAP/chol cationic LNPs is thus described and will help improve drug delivery of nucleic acid\u2013based vaccines and therapies."

We discuss computational studies and modeling techniques to enhance the understanding of how LNPs interact with therapeutic cargo and to predict the potential effectiveness of such interactions in therapeutic applications. We also analyze the benefits and drawbacks of various LNP production techniques such as nanoprecipitation, emulsification, evaporation, thin film hydration, microfluidic-based methods, and an impingement jet mixer. Additionally, we discuss the major challenges associated with industrial development, including stability and sterilization, storage, regulatory compliance, reproducibility, and quality control. Overcoming these challenges and facilitating regulatory compliance represent the key steps toward LNP\u2019s successful commercialization and translation into clinical settings."

Moreover, research and development of engineered multifunctional nanoparticles as pharmaceutical drug carriers have spurred exponential growth in applications to medicine in the last decade. Design principles of these nanoparticles, including nanoemulsions, dendrimers, nano-gold, liposomes, drug-carrier conjugates, antibody-drug complexes, and magnetic nanoparticles, are primarily based on unique assemblies of synthetic, natural, or biological components, including but not limited to synthetic polymers, metal ions, oils, and lipids as their building blocks. However, the potential success of these particles in the clinic relies on consideration of important parameters such as nanoparticle fabrication strategies, their physical properties, drug loading efficiencies, drug release potential, and, most importantly, minimum toxicity of the carrier itself. Among these, lipid-based nanoparticles bear the advantage of being the least toxic for in vivo applications, and significant progress has been made in the area of DNA/RNA and drug delivery using lipid-based nanoassemblies. In this review, we will primarily focus on the recent advances and updates on lipid-based nanoparticles for their projected applications in drug delivery. We begin with a review of current activities in the field of liposomes (the so-called honorary nanoparticles), and challenging issues of targeting and triggering will be discussed in detail. We will further describe nanoparticles derived from a novel class of amphipathic lipids called bolaamphiphiles with unique lipid assembly features that have been recently examined as drug/DNA delivery vehicles. Finally, an overview of an emerging novel class of particles (based on lipid components other than phospholipids), solid lipid nanoparticles and nanostructured lipid carriers will be presented. We conclude with a few examples of clinically successful formulations of currently available lipid-based nanoparticles.",

There are several examples of biomacromolecules used nowadays in the therapeutics, which are promising candidates to be delivered by means of liposomes and lipid nanoparticles, such as solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC). Several production procedures can be applied to achieve a high association efficiency between the bioactives and the carrier, depending on the physicochemical properties of both, as well as on the production procedure applied. Generally, this can lead to improved bioavailability, or in case of oral administration a more consistent temporal profile of absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Advantages and drawbacks of such colloidal carriers are also pointed out.

Since that time, the field of nanomedicine has evolved alongside growing technological needs to improve the delivery of various therapeutics. Over these past decades, newer generations of nanoparticles have emerged that are capable of performing additional delivery functions that can enable treatment via new therapeutic modalities. In the current clinical landscape, many of these new generation nanoparticles have reached clinical trials and have been approved for various indications. In the first issue of Bioengineering & Translational Medicine in 2016, we reviewed the history, current clinical landscape, and clinical challenges of nanoparticle delivery systems. Here, we provide a 3 year update on the current clinical landscape of nanoparticle drug delivery systems and highlight newly approved nanomedicines, provide a status update on previous clinical trials, and highlight new technologies that have recently entered the clinic."

They have been shown to be beneficial for stabilizing therapeutic compounds, overcoming obstacles to cellular and tissue uptake, and improving biodistribution of compounds to target sites in vivo. This enables effective delivery of encapsulated compounds to target sites while minimizing systemic toxicity. Liposomes present as an attractive delivery system due to their flexible physicochemical and biophysical properties, which allow easy manipulation to address different delivery considerations. Despite considerable research in the last 50 years and the plethora of positive results in preclinical studies, the clinical translation of liposome assisted drug delivery platforms has progressed incrementally.

                            "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have emerged across the pharmaceutical industry as promising vehicles to deliver a variety of therapeutics. Currently in the spotlight as vital components of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, LNPs play a key role in effectively protecting and transporting mRNA to cells. Liposomes, an early version of LNPs, are a versatile nanomedicine delivery platform. A number of liposomal drugs have been approved and applied to medical practice. Subsequent generations of lipid nanocarriers, such as solid lipid nanoparticles, nanostructured lipid carriers, and cationic lipid-nucleic acid complexes, exhibit more complex architectures and enhanced physical stabilities. With their ability to encapsulate and deliver therapeutics to specific locations within the body and to release their contents at a desired time, LNPs provide a valuable platform for treatment of a variety of diseases. Here, we present a landscape of LNP-related scientific publications, including patents and journal articles, based on analysis of the CAS Content Collection, the largest human-curated collection of published scientific knowledge. Rising trends are identified, such as nanostructured lipid carriers and solid lipid nanoparticles becoming the preferred platforms for numerous formulations. Recent advancements in LNP formulations as drug delivery platforms, such as antitumor and nucleic acid therapeutics and vaccine delivery systems, are discussed. Challenges and growth opportunities are also evaluated in other areas, such as medical imaging, cosmetics, nutrition, and agrochemicals. This report is intended to serve as a useful resource for those interested in LNP nanotechnologies, their applications, and the global research effort for their development."

(15 sources)",
                "text": "\nThe manufacturing processes for lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) present several distinct advantages that make them superior to polymeric and inorganic alternatives for large-scale clinical drug delivery applications. One of the most fundamental advantages is the simplicity of their production processes. As noted by Khurana et al., \"the most fundamental rationale of using LNPs, as an alternative to polymeric nanoparticles, is the simplicity of large-scale manufacturing and their low toxicity\" <Paper corpusId=\"232368936\" paperTitle=\"(Khurana et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nA key manufacturing benefit is that many LNP production methods, particularly for solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), \"do not require organic solvents, which eliminates the risk of toxicity caused by solvent residues\" <Paper corpusId=\"233396407\" paperTitle=\"(Thi et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. This solvent-free approach simplifies both production and regulatory approval processes. LNPs can be \"produced by a variety of technologies including heat or cold homogenization, which is easy to scale up production, has good preparation repeatability and does not require toxic organic solvents in the preparation process\" <Paper corpusId=\"244779759\" paperTitle=\"(Lu et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe scalability of LNP production represents another significant advantage. Modern manufacturing techniques such as microfluidics have revolutionized LNP production capabilities. Microfluidic production \"has the advantage of producing homogeneously sized nanoparticles via a simple process, and large quantities of these nanoparticles can be easily produced\" <Paper corpusId=\"259236911\" paperTitle=\"(Kim et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This technique is described as \"a precise, reproducible, and scalable method for manufacturing LNPs\" with \"easily adjustable parameters, which can be precisely controlled with relative ease in comparison with other methods of LNP manufacturing\" <Paper corpusId=\"272844430\" paperTitle=\"(McMillan et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nFrom an industrial perspective, LNPs offer \"multiple advantages compared with other carrier systems, such as large scale production using microfluidics or T-junction mixing, stability, and low cost of raw materials\" <Paper corpusId=\"232368936\" paperTitle=\"(Khurana et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"231677450\" paperTitle=\"(Elia et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"231676976\" paperTitle=\"(Buschmann et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. This combination of production efficiency and economic benefits makes LNPs particularly attractive for commercial development.\n\nThe synthesis of LNPs is also \"more straightforward to scale up than that of liposomes because they are produced by emulsification between an organic phase and an aqueous phase using the properties of surfactants\" <Paper corpusId=\"257244786\" paperTitle=\"(Seo et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"252142220\" paperTitle=\"(Khairnar et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"51890703\" paperTitle=\"(Ghasemiyeh et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>. This streamlined approach to manufacturing helps address one of the key challenges in nanomedicine - transitioning from laboratory-scale production to industrial manufacturing.\n\nAdditionally, LNPs benefit from favorable validation and regulatory attributes, being \"easy to validate\" <Paper corpusId=\"4713903\" paperTitle=\"(Attama et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper> and can be \"easily scaled up and sterilized\" <Paper corpusId=\"4713903\" paperTitle=\"(Attama et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper>. The use of \"generally recognized as safe (GRAS) substances\" in LNP formulations further facilitates regulatory approval processes <Paper corpusId=\"7489958\" paperTitle=\"(Almeida et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThese manufacturing advantages collectively contribute to LNPs being recognized as having \"ease of engineering processes, up-scaling feasibility... less expensive... easy validation\" compared to alternative nanoparticle systems <Paper corpusId=\"240262693\" paperTitle=\"(Bukhari et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. They can be \"produced by simple and economical large-scale production\" methods <Paper corpusId=\"235212646\" paperTitle=\"(Arana et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"85515889\" paperTitle=\"(Bayon-Cordero et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>, further cementing their position as ideal candidates for industrial-scale pharmaceutical manufacturing.",

SLN can be prepared by a variety of technologies including heat or cold homogenization, which is easy to scale up production, has good preparation repeatability and does not require toxic organic solvents in the preparation process (M\u00fcller et al., 2000)(Deshmukh, 2014)."

                            "Conventional batch-mode mixing methods rely on the homogenization of the particle size through sonication and extrusion (He et al., 2018). However, mass production using these methods is difficult, and high batch-to-batch variability is a drawback. In particular, low yields and complex processes have made the clinical transition of LNPs difficult. In contrast, microfluidic production techniques have the advantage of producing homogeneously sized nanoparticles via a simple process, and large quantities of these nanoparticles can be easily produced (Sato et al., 2016). The size of the nanoparticles can also be effectively controlled using microfluidic devices (Kimura et al., 2020)",

The urgent need for a vaccine has led to the development of various immunization approaches. mRNA vaccines represent a cell-free, simple, and rapid platform for immunization, and therefore have been employed in recent studies toward the development of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Herein, we present the design of an mRNA vaccine, based on lipid nanoparticles (LNPs)-encapsulated SARS-CoV-2 human Fc-conjugated receptor-binding domain (RBD-hFc). Several ionizable lipids have been evaluated in vivo in a luciferase (luc) mRNA reporter assay, and two leading LNPs formulations have been chosen for the subsequent RBD-hFc mRNA vaccine strategy. Intramuscular administration of LNP RBD-hFc mRNA elicited robust humoral response, a high level of neutralizing antibodies and a Th1-biased cellular response in BALB/c mice. The data in the current study demonstrate the potential of these lipids as promising candidates for LNP-based mRNA vaccines in general and for a COVID19 vaccine in particular."

                            "Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) are an alternate carrier system to liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, and inorganic carriers. SLNs have attracted increasing attention in recent years for delivering drugs, nucleic acids, proteins, peptides, nutraceuticals, and cosmetics. These nanocarriers have attracted industrial attention due to their ease of preparation, physicochemical stability, and scalability. These characteristics make SLNs attractive for manufacture on a large scale. Currently, several products with SLNs are in clinical trials, and there is a high possibility that SLN carriers will quickly increase their presence in the market. A large-scale manufacturing unit is required for commercial applications to prepare enough formulations for clinical studies. Furthermore, continuous processing is becoming more popular in the pharmaceutical sector to reduce product batch-to-batch differences. This review paper discusses some conventional methods and the rationale for large-scale production. It further covers recent progress in scale-up methods for the synthesis of SLNs, including high-pressure homogenization (HPH), hot melt extrusion coupled with HPH, microchannels, nanoprecipitation using static mixers, and microemulsion-based methods. These scale-up technologies enable the possibility of commercialization of SLNs. Furthermore, ongoing studies indicate that these technologies will eventually reach the pharmaceutical market."

Particularly, Solid Lipid Nanoparticles (SLNs) have emerged as promising nanocarriers in cancer therapy. SLNs offer remarkable advantages such as low toxicity, high bioavailability of drugs, versatility of incorporation of hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs, and feasibility of large-scale production. Their molecular structure is crucial to obtain high quality SLN preparations and it is determined by the relationship between the composition and preparation method. Additionally, SLNs allow overcoming several physiological barriers that hinder drug delivery to tumors and are also able to escape multidrug resistance mechanisms, characteristic of cancer cells. Focusing on cell delivery, SLNs can improve drug delivery to target cells by different mechanisms, such as passive mechanisms that take advantage of the tumor microenvironment, active mechanisms by surface modification of SLNs, and codelivery mechanisms. SLNs can incorporate many different drugs and have proven to be effective in different types of tumors (i.e., breast, lung, colon, liver, and brain), corroborating their potential. Finally, it has to be taken into account that there are still some challenges to face in the application of SLNs in anticancer treatments but their possibilities seem to be high."

These cost advantages, combined with efficient scale-up capabilities and high drug loading capacity, make LNPs particularly attractive for commercial pharmaceutical production. (14 sources)",
                "text": "\nThe economic and resource advantages of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) represent a critical factor in their suitability for large-scale clinical drug delivery applications. One of the most significant economic benefits is the relatively low cost of raw materials used in LNP production. As noted by Khurana et al., LNPs offer \"multiple advantages compared with other carrier systems, such as... low cost of raw materials\" <Paper corpusId=\"232368936\" paperTitle=\"(Khurana et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. This cost advantage provides a fundamental economic incentive for pharmaceutical companies to adopt LNP-based drug delivery systems over alternatives.\n\nBeyond raw material expenses, LNPs are recognized as \"less expensive\" overall compared to polymeric and inorganic alternatives <Paper corpusId=\"240262693\" paperTitle=\"(Bukhari et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. This general cost-effectiveness stems from multiple factors throughout the production process. Kumar et al. specifically highlight \"low production costs\" as a key advantage that makes LNPs preferred over polymeric nanoparticles <Paper corpusId=\"249916106\" paperTitle=\"(Kumar et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>, while Ashfaq et al. similarly emphasize the \"low production cost\" alongside \"ease of scale-up\" that makes LNPs \"a more preferable option among colloidal carriers\" <Paper corpusId=\"264789329\" paperTitle=\"(Ashfaq et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe economic benefits of LNPs extend to manufacturing efficiency through high drug loading capacity. High drug loading nanoparticles offer advantages such as \"reducing manufacturing cost and increasing production scalability\" <Paper corpusId=\"259383591\" paperTitle=\"(Xu et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This increased loading capacity means more therapeutic agent can be delivered per unit of carrier material, improving the overall economic efficiency of the formulation.\n\nFrom a resource utilization perspective, LNPs are characterized by \"relatively low production costs, and feasibility for large-scale industrial manufacturing\" <Paper corpusId=\"271997570\" paperTitle=\"(Adamo et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"261160050\" paperTitle=\"(Mehta et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. The straightforward scale-up process of LNPs compared to liposomes - \"produced by emulsification between an organic phase and an aqueous phase using the properties of surfactants\" - contributes to their cost-effectiveness <Paper corpusId=\"257244786\" paperTitle=\"(Seo et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"252142220\" paperTitle=\"(Khairnar et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"51890703\" paperTitle=\"(Ghasemiyeh et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>. This simplified manufacturing approach reduces the need for specialized equipment and complex processes that would otherwise increase production costs.\n\nThe economic advantages of LNPs also extend to long-term storage and stability, with research showing they are a \"cost-effective choice for nucleic acid delivery due to their ease of manufacturing and reproducible scale-up procedures\" <Paper corpusId=\"269312598\" paperTitle=\"(Arjunan et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"248668143\" paperTitle=\"(Sun et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. This reproducibility and stability reduces waste and rework during manufacturing, further enhancing the economic profile of LNP production.\n\nWhen compared to polymeric nanoparticles specifically, the economic advantages of LNPs are particularly notable. Khurana et al. state that \"the most fundamental rationale of using LNPs, as an alternative to polymeric nanoparticles, is the simplicity of large-scale manufacturing\" <Paper corpusId=\"232368936\" paperTitle=\"(Khurana et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"231676976\" paperTitle=\"(Buschmann et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"231677450\" paperTitle=\"(Elia et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.

                            "Over the past decade, the therapeutic potential of nanomaterials as novel drug delivery systems complementing conventional pharmacology has been widely acknowledged. Among these nanomaterials, lipid-based nanoparticles (LNPs) have shown remarkable pharmacological performance and promising therapeutic outcomes, thus gaining substantial interest in preclinical and clinical research. In this review, we introduce the main types of LNPs used in drug formulations such as liposomes, nanoemulsions, solid lipid nanoparticles, nanostructured lipid carriers, and lipid polymer hybrid nanoparticles, focusing on their main physicochemical properties and therapeutic potential. We discuss computational studies and modeling techniques to enhance the understanding of how LNPs interact with therapeutic cargo and to predict the potential effectiveness of such interactions in therapeutic applications. We also analyze the benefits and drawbacks of various LNP production techniques such as nanoprecipitation, emulsification, evaporation, thin film hydration, microfluidic-based methods, and an impingement jet mixer. Additionally, we discuss the major challenges associated with industrial development, including stability and sterilization, storage, regulatory compliance, reproducibility, and quality control. Overcoming these challenges and facilitating regulatory compliance represent the key steps toward LNP\u2019s successful commercialization and translation into clinical settings."

                            "Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) are an alternate carrier system to liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, and inorganic carriers. SLNs have attracted increasing attention in recent years for delivering drugs, nucleic acids, proteins, peptides, nutraceuticals, and cosmetics. These nanocarriers have attracted industrial attention due to their ease of preparation, physicochemical stability, and scalability. These characteristics make SLNs attractive for manufacture on a large scale. Currently, several products with SLNs are in clinical trials, and there is a high possibility that SLN carriers will quickly increase their presence in the market. A large-scale manufacturing unit is required for commercial applications to prepare enough formulations for clinical studies. Furthermore, continuous processing is becoming more popular in the pharmaceutical sector to reduce product batch-to-batch differences. This review paper discusses some conventional methods and the rationale for large-scale production. It further covers recent progress in scale-up methods for the synthesis of SLNs, including high-pressure homogenization (HPH), hot melt extrusion coupled with HPH, microchannels, nanoprecipitation using static mixers, and microemulsion-based methods. These scale-up technologies enable the possibility of commercialization of SLNs. Furthermore, ongoing studies indicate that these technologies will eventually reach the pharmaceutical market."

                            "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) can be used as delivery vehicles for nucleic acid biotherapeutics. In fact, LNPs are currently being used in the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. Cationic LNPs composed of 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP)/cholesterol (chol) LNPs have been classified as one of the most efficient gene delivery systems and are being tested in numerous clinical trials. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of the molar ratio of DOTAP/chol, PEGylation, and lipid to mRNA ratio on mRNA transfection, and explore the applications of DOTAP/chol LNPs in pDNA and oligonucleotide transfection. Here we showed that PEGylation significantly decreased mRNA transfection efficiency of DOTAP/chol LNPs. Among non-PEGylated LNP formulations, 1:3 molar ratio of DOTAP/chol in DOTAP/chol LNPs showed the highest mRNA transfection efficiency. Furthermore, the optimal ratio of DOTAP/chol LNPs to mRNA was tested to be 62.5 \u00b5M lipid to 1 \u03bcg mRNA. More importantly, these mRNA-loaded nanoparticles were stable for 60 days at 4 \u00b0C storage without showing reduction in transfection efficacy. We further found that DOTAP/chol LNPs were able to transfect pDNA and oligonucleotides, demonstrating the ability of these LNPs to transport the cargo into the cell nucleus. The influence of various factors in the formulation of DOTAP/chol cationic LNPs is thus described and will help improve drug delivery of nucleic acid\u2013based vaccines and therapies."

The urgent need for a vaccine has led to the development of various immunization approaches. mRNA vaccines represent a cell-free, simple, and rapid platform for immunization, and therefore have been employed in recent studies toward the development of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Herein, we present the design of an mRNA vaccine, based on lipid nanoparticles (LNPs)-encapsulated SARS-CoV-2 human Fc-conjugated receptor-binding domain (RBD-hFc). Several ionizable lipids have been evaluated in vivo in a luciferase (luc) mRNA reporter assay, and two leading LNPs formulations have been chosen for the subsequent RBD-hFc mRNA vaccine strategy. Intramuscular administration of LNP RBD-hFc mRNA elicited robust humoral response, a high level of neutralizing antibodies and a Th1-biased cellular response in BALB/c mice. The data in the current study demonstrate the potential of these lipids as promising candidates for LNP-based mRNA vaccines in general and for a COVID19 vaccine in particular."

(10 sources)",
                "text": "\nThe physical and formulation properties of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) provide significant advantages that directly support their scalability for industrial production. One of the most important physical characteristics is their enhanced stability profile, with solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) exhibiting \"enhanced stability due to rigid lipid matrix\" <Paper corpusId=\"240580539\" paperTitle=\"(Yuliani, 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. This improved stability translates directly to manufacturing advantages, as it enables \"high product stability\" <Paper corpusId=\"244213917\" paperTitle=\"(Satapathy et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> and \"better stability to sterilization in comparison to another lipid nanocarriers\" <Paper corpusId=\"247969208\" paperTitle=\"(Cholkar et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe compositional flexibility of LNPs represents another key physical property supporting scalability. The \"appropriate selection of lipids and surfactants\" significantly impacts \"particle size (PS), long-term storage stability, drug loading (DL), and release behaviors\" <Paper corpusId=\"248301171\" paperTitle=\"(Javed et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. This flexibility allows manufacturers to optimize formulations for specific therapeutic applications while maintaining scalable production processes. The unique lipid matrix composition provides \"biocompatibility, biodegradability, protection of the encapsulated compound against enzymatic degradation\" <Paper corpusId=\"226252335\" paperTitle=\"(Anwar et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>, all critical attributes for pharmaceutical-grade products.\n\nDrug loading capacity is another physical property that enhances the scalability of LNP production. LNPs offer \"increased loading capacity\" <Paper corpusId=\"252145310\" paperTitle=\"(Chaudhuri et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> and \"high entrapment efficiency against hydrophobic drugs\" <Paper corpusId=\"240580539\" paperTitle=\"(Yuliani, 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. SLNs and NLCs in particular are \"praised for their low toxicity, enhanced encapsulation capacity, controlled drug release kinetics, and scalability\" <Paper corpusId=\"269827015\" paperTitle=\"(Omidian et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"32952680\" paperTitle=\"(Islan et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>. This high loading efficiency means more therapeutic agent can be delivered per production batch, improving manufacturing economics.\n\nA particularly valuable formulation property of LNPs is their versatility in drug encapsulation. They offer the \"possibility incorporation both lipophilic and hydrophilic drugs\" <Paper corpusId=\"226252335\" paperTitle=\"(Anwar et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> and \"can incorporate both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs (as single compounds or in a combination)\" <Paper corpusId=\"265409712\" paperTitle=\"(Wu et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This dual capability eliminates the need for different carrier systems for different drug types, streamlining manufacturing operations.\n\nThe physical properties of LNPs also contribute to their controlled release capabilities, which is an important pharmaceutical attribute for scaled production. They provide \"ability to entrap and deliver diverse molecules in a controlled manner with enhanced bioavailability\" <Paper corpusId=\"269827015\" paperTitle=\"(Omidian et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> and \"controlled drug release\" <Paper corpusId=\"226252335\" paperTitle=\"(Anwar et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. These release properties can be modulated through formulation adjustments, providing manufacturing flexibility while maintaining therapeutic efficacy.\n\nLong-term stability is another critical physical attribute supporting industrial-scale production. LNPs \"offer good long-term stability\" <Paper corpusId=\"265409712\" paperTitle=\"(Wu et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>, reducing concerns about product degradation during storage and distribution. This stability profile simplifies supply chain logistics and extends product shelf-life, both important considerations for commercial manufacturing.\n\nThe physical and formulation advantages of LNPs culminate in their \"desirable physicochemical stability for industrial scalability\" <Paper corpusId=\"269895711\" paperTitle=\"(Canales et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>, making them \"promising nanodrugs for large-scale manufacturing\" <Paper corpusId=\"269895711\" paperTitle=\"(Canales et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. Their \"economic production, simple preparation, and desirable physicochemical stability\" <Paper corpusId=\"269895711\" paperTitle=\"(Canales et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> collectively position LNPs as ideal candidates for industrial-scale pharmaceutical production. These inherent physical properties ensure that \"their major benefit is the prospect of their large-scale industrial development\" <Paper corpusId=\"248301171\" paperTitle=\"(Javed et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.",

Solid lipid nanoparticles and nanostructured lipids carriers are widely seen as the workhorses of drug delivery systems because of low toxicity, enhanced encapsulation capacity, controlled drug kinetic release, easy tailoring and targeting and practicable scale up.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nA new generation of hybrid lipid nanoparticles has emerged by combining the lipidic properties with polymers, proteins and metallic structures. The main features of hybrid lipid nanoparticles including popular methods for synthesis and characterization, biological and toxicological properties, administration routes, drug encapsulation strategies, tailoring and targeting, and potential systems for use in biomedicine are described in the present review."

Efficient delivery of mRNA vaccines will be key for their success and translation to the clinic. Among potential nonviral vectors, lipid nanoparticles are particularly promising. Indeed, lipid nanoparticles can be synthesized with relative ease in a scalable manner, protect the mRNA against degradation, facilitate endosomal escape, can be targeted to the desired cell type by surface decoration with ligands, and as needed, can be codelivered with adjuvants."

Despite their development over the past several decades, this technology is still hindered by issues with the manufacturing processes leading to high polydispersity, batch-to-batch and operator-dependent variability, and limits to the production volumes. To overcome these issues, the use of microfluidic techniques in the production of LBNPs has sharply increased over the past two years. Microfluidics overcomes many of the pitfalls seen with conventional production methods, leading to reproducible LBNPs at lower costs and higher yields. In this review, the use of microfluidics in the preparation of various types of LBNPs, including liposomes, lipid nanoparticles, and solid lipid nanoparticles for the delivery of small molecules, oligonucleotides, and peptide/protein drugs is summarized. Various microfluidic parameters, as well as their effects on the physicochemical properties of LBNPs, are also discussed."

                            "In recent years, various nanotechnology platforms in the area of medical biology, including both diagnostics and therapy, have gained remarkable attention. Moreover, research and development of engineered multifunctional nanoparticles as pharmaceutical drug carriers have spurred exponential growth in applications to medicine in the last decade. Design principles of these nanoparticles, including nanoemulsions, dendrimers, nano-gold, liposomes, drug-carrier conjugates, antibody-drug complexes, and magnetic nanoparticles, are primarily based on unique assemblies of synthetic, natural, or biological components, including but not limited to synthetic polymers, metal ions, oils, and lipids as their building blocks. However, the potential success of these particles in the clinic relies on consideration of important parameters such as nanoparticle fabrication strategies, their physical properties, drug loading efficiencies, drug release potential, and, most importantly, minimum toxicity of the carrier itself. Among these, lipid-based nanoparticles bear the advantage of being the least toxic for in vivo applications, and significant progress has been made in the area of DNA/RNA and drug delivery using lipid-based nanoassemblies. In this review, we will primarily focus on the recent advances and updates on lipid-based nanoparticles for their projected applications in drug delivery. We begin with a review of current activities in the field of liposomes (the so-called honorary nanoparticles), and challenging issues of targeting and triggering will be discussed in detail. We will further describe nanoparticles derived from a novel class of amphipathic lipids called bolaamphiphiles with unique lipid assembly features that have been recently examined as drug/DNA delivery vehicles. Finally, an overview of an emerging novel class of particles (based on lipid components other than phospholipids), solid lipid nanoparticles and nanostructured lipid carriers will be presented. We conclude with a few examples of clinically successful formulations of currently available lipid-based nanoparticles."

However, mass production using these methods is difficult, and high batch-to-batch variability is a drawback. In particular, low yields and complex processes have made the clinical transition of LNPs difficult. In contrast, microfluidic production techniques have the advantage of producing homogeneously sized nanoparticles via a simple process, and large quantities of these nanoparticles can be easily produced (Sato et al., 2016). The size of the nanoparticles can also be effectively controlled using microfluidic devices (Kimura et al., 2020)",

Their multiple advantages include formulation and synthesis simplicity, self-assembly, biocompatibility, and high bioavailability (Sercombe et al., 2015). Common fabrication techniques for lipid-based nanocarriers are highpressure homogenization, high-speed stirring, ultrasonication, emulsion/solvent evaporation, double emulsion, phase inversion, and solvent injection (Tenchov et al., 2021)."

                            "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have emerged across the pharmaceutical industry as promising vehicles to deliver a variety of therapeutics. Currently in the spotlight as vital components of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, LNPs play a key role in effectively protecting and transporting mRNA to cells. Liposomes, an early version of LNPs, are a versatile nanomedicine delivery platform. A number of liposomal drugs have been approved and applied to medical practice. Subsequent generations of lipid nanocarriers, such as solid lipid nanoparticles, nanostructured lipid carriers, and cationic lipid-nucleic acid complexes, exhibit more complex architectures and enhanced physical stabilities. With their ability to encapsulate and deliver therapeutics to specific locations within the body and to release their contents at a desired time, LNPs provide a valuable platform for treatment of a variety of diseases. Here, we present a landscape of LNP-related scientific publications, including patents and journal articles, based on analysis of the CAS Content Collection, the largest human-curated collection of published scientific knowledge. Rising trends are identified, such as nanostructured lipid carriers and solid lipid nanoparticles becoming the preferred platforms for numerous formulations. Recent advancements in LNP formulations as drug delivery platforms, such as antitumor and nucleic acid therapeutics and vaccine delivery systems, are discussed. Challenges and growth opportunities are also evaluated in other areas, such as medical imaging, cosmetics, nutrition, and agrochemicals. This report is intended to serve as a useful resource for those interested in LNP nanotechnologies, their applications, and the global research effort for their development."

                            "Microfluidic methodologies for preparation of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) based on an organic solvent injection method enable precise size control of the LNPs. After preparation of LNPs, the organic solvent injection method needs some post-treatments, such as overnight dialysis or direct dilution with a buffer solution. LNP production using the microfluidic-based organic solvent injection method is dominated by kinetics rather than thermodynamics. Kinetics of ethanol removal from the inner and outer membranes of LNPs could induce a structural change in the membrane that could lead to fusion of LNPs. However, the effects of microfluidic post-treatment on the final size of LNPs have not been sufficiently understood. Herein, we investigated the effect of the post-treatment processes on the final product size of LNPs in detail. A simple baffle device and a model lipid system composed of a neutral phospholipid (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, POPC) and cholesterol were used to produce the LNPs. We demonstrated that flow conditions of the post-treatment diluting the remaining ethanol in the LNP suspension affected the final product size of LNPs. Based on the findings, we developed an integrated baffle device composed of an LNP production region and a post-treatment region for a microfluidic-based LNP production system; this integrated baffle device prevented the undesirable aggregation or fusion of POPC LNPs even for the high-lipid-concentration condition. Finally, we applied our concept to small interfering RNA (siRNA) delivery and confirmed that no significant effects due to the continuous process occurred on the siRNA encapsulation efficiency, biological distribution, and knockdown activity. The microfluidic post-treatment method is expected to contribute to the production of LNPs for practical applications and the development of novel LNP-based nanomedicines."

                            "Non-viral delivery of nucleic acids for therapies based on RNA interference requires a rational design and optimal self-assembly strategies. Nucleic acid particles need to be small, stable and functional in terms of selective cell uptake and controlled release of encapsulated nucleic acids. Here we report on small (\u223c38 nm) monomolecular nucleic acid/lipid particles (mNALPs) that contain single molecules of short double-stranded oligonucleotides covered by a tight, highly curved lipid bilayer. The particles consist of DOPE, DOTAP, DOPC and DSPE-PEG(2000) and are assembled with 21 bp double-stranded DNA or small interfering RNA by solvent exchange on a hydrodynamic-focusing microfluidic chip. In comparison to vortex mixing by hand this method increases the encapsulation efficiency by 20%, and yields particles with a narrower size distribution, negligible aggregate formation and high stability in blood plasma and serum. Modification of mNALPs with folate-conjugated PEG-lipids results in specific binding and uptake by epithelial carcinoma KB cells overexpressing folate receptors. Binding is significantly reduced by competitive inhibition using free folate and is not observed with non-targeted mNALPs, revealing high specificity. The functionalized mNALPs show gene silencing in the presence of chloroquine, an endosome-destabilizing agent. Together, the robust self-assembly of small-sized mNALPs with their high stability and receptor-specific cell uptake demonstrate that the tight, PEG-grafted lipid-bilayer encapsulation may offer a promising approach towards the delivery of short double-stranded oligonucleotides."

Perhaps the most significant comparative advantage is their superior safety profile. Unlike polymeric and inorganic alternatives, LNPs \"have less toxicological risk due to the natural and biological origins of their materials\" <Paper corpusId=\"271921383\" paperTitle=\"(Amiri et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. This reduced toxicity represents a fundamental rationale for preferring LNPs over polymeric nanoparticles <Paper corpusId=\"232368936\" paperTitle=\"(Khurana et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) specifically were developed \"to address the flaws of conventional colloidal carriers\" including \"polymer degradation and cytotoxicity\" <Paper corpusId=\"245239319\" paperTitle=\"(Safer et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nFrom a manufacturing perspective, LNPs offer substantial advantages in terms of production scalability compared to alternatives. They demonstrate \"feasibility of large scale production\" and \"high product stability\" over liposomes and polymeric nanoparticles <Paper corpusId=\"244213917\" paperTitle=\"(Satapathy et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. This scalability advantage is complemented by their \"low production costs, and ease of preparation\" <Paper corpusId=\"249916106\" paperTitle=\"(Kumar et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. The combined benefits of \"low production cost, ease of scale-up, better stability profile, and ease of modifications make LNPs a more preferable option among colloidal carriers\" <Paper corpusId=\"264789329\" paperTitle=\"(Ashfaq et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nAnother key differentiator is that many LNP production methods avoid the use of organic solvents, unlike some polymeric nanoparticle preparation techniques. The \"avoidance of organic solvents related to the production method\" is highlighted as a significant advantage of SLNs <Paper corpusId=\"271921383\" paperTitle=\"(Amiri et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. This elimination of organic solvents reduces both environmental impact and potential toxicity concerns.\n\nSolid lipid nanoparticles in particular \"offer an alternative carrier system to liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, and inorganic carriers\" with advantages stemming from their \"economic production, simple preparation, and desirable physicochemical stability for industrial scalability\" <Paper corpusId=\"269895711\" paperTitle=\"(Canales et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. These characteristics collectively make them more promising candidates for large-scale manufacturing compared to alternative nanoparticle systems.\n\nDespite these advantages, it's important to acknowledge that challenges remain for widespread clinical adoption of LNPs. These include \"potential toxicity, the scalability of their production, regulatory approval, and the need for more comprehensive in vivo studies\" <Paper corpusId=\"272340496\" paperTitle=\"(Giordano et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.

We present an overview of mRNA delivery systems and then focus on the lipid nanoparticles used in the current SARS-CoV-2 vaccine clinical trials. The review concludes with an analysis of the determinants of the performance of lipid nanoparticles in mRNA vaccines."
