            "abstract": "A first pilot study showed that an image-guided navigation system could improve resection margin rates in locally advanced (LARC) and locally recurrent rectal cancer (LRRC) patients. Incremental surgical innovation is often implemented without reimbursement consequences, health economic aspects should however also be taken into account. This study evaluates the early cost-effectiveness of navigated surgery compared to standard surgery in LARC and LRRC. A Markov decision model was constructed to estimate the expected costs and outcomes for navigated and standard surgery. The input parameters were based on pilot data from a prospective (navigation cohort n =\u200933) and retrospective (control group n =\u2009142) data. Utility values were measured in a comparable group (n =\u200963) through the EQ5D-5L. Additionally, sensitivity and value of information analyses were performed. Based on this early evaluation, navigated surgery showed incremental costs of \u20ac3141 and \u20ac2896 in LARC and LRRC. In LARC, navigated surgery resulted in 2.05 Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) vs 2.02 QALYs for standard surgery. For LRRC, we found 1.73 vs 1.67 QALYs respectively. This showed an Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) of \u20ac136.604 for LARC and \u20ac52.510 for LRRC per QALY gained. In scenario analyses, optimal utilization rates of the navigation technology lowered the ICER to \u20ac61.817 and \u20ac21.334 for LARC and LRRC. The ICERs of both indications were most sensitive to uncertainty surrounding the risk of progression in the first year after surgery, the risk of having a positive surgical margin, and the costs of the navigation system. Adding navigation system use is expected to be cost-effective in LRRC and has the potential to become cost-effective in LARC. To increase the probability of being cost-effective, it is crucial to optimize efficient use of both the hybrid OR and the navigation system and identify subgroups where navigation is expected to show higher effectiveness.",

                    "text": "Rectal cancer is mainly treated by surgical resection, often complemented with pre-and/or postoperative (chemo) radiotherapy in stage II-IV tumors [1][2][3], showing a 5-year survival rate of ~ 45% for stage III and ~ 20% for stage IV tumors [4]. Surgical resection of both locally advanced (LARC) and locally recurrent rectal cancer (LRRC) requires special consideration because (1) the disruption of normal anatomical planes and (2) radiotherapy-induced fibrosis can lead to a higher risk of a tumor positive involved circumferential resection margin [1,5]. In this setting, LARC was defined as T3 or T4 tumors extending close to (< 2 mm) or invading the mesorectal fascia, as shown on rectal magnetic resonance imaging. LRRC was defined as rectal cancer that recurred in the pelvic area after earlier treatment. In 10-15% of rectal cancer patients, positive surgical margins are found [6,7] which negatively affects the prognosis [8][9][10]. Local recurrence can cause debilitating symptoms, and often requires additional treatment, such as chemoradiotherapy and radiotherapy. Optimizing surgical practice and decreasing the risk of positive resection margins is therefore of great clinical and financial importance. \n\nMultiple technologies have emerged to improve the quality of surgery and surgical outcomes [11]. The Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI-AVL) has developed an image-guided navigation system to improve tumor localization during the operative procedure and prevent damage to surrounding vital structures [12]. Recently, this navigation system has been evaluated in the first series of LARC and LRRC patients, showing substantially improved negative surgical margin rates compared to standard surgery in a historical control group [12]. Since the use of a navigation system is associated with extra costs (e.g. due to extra imaging, the navigation system, and personnel), and hospital budgets are limited, new surgical technologies have to prove themselves in terms of cost-effectiveness to have a chance of reimbursement.",

Lindenberg, A. Kramer, E. Kok, V. Ret\u00e8l, G. Beets, T. Ruers, W. V. van Harten\n## Abstract\nA first pilot study showed that an image-guided navigation system could improve resection margin rates in locally advanced (LARC) and locally recurrent rectal cancer (LRRC) patients. Incremental surgical innovation is often implemented without reimbursement consequences, health economic aspects should however also be taken into account. This study evaluates the early cost-effectiveness of navigated surgery compared to standard surgery in LARC and LRRC. A Markov decision model was constructed to estimate the expected costs and outcomes for navigated and standard surgery. The input parameters were based on pilot data from a prospective (navigation cohort n =\u200933) and retrospective (control group n =\u2009142) data. Utility values were measured in a comparable group (n =\u200963) through the EQ5D-5L. Additionally, sensitivity and value of information analyses were performed. Based on this early evaluation, navigated surgery showed incremental costs of \u20ac3141 and \u20ac2896 in LARC and LRRC. In LARC, navigated surgery resulted in 2.05 Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) vs 2.02 QALYs for standard surgery. For LRRC, we found 1.73 vs 1.67 QALYs respectively. This showed an Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) of \u20ac136.604 for LARC and \u20ac52.510 for LRRC per QALY gained. In scenario analyses, optimal utilization rates of the navigation technology lowered the ICER to \u20ac61.817 and \u20ac21.334 for LARC and LRRC. The ICERs of both indications were most sensitive to uncertainty surrounding the risk of progression in the first year after surgery, the risk of having a positive surgical margin, and the costs of the navigation system. Adding navigation system use is expected to be cost-effective in LRRC and has the potential to become cost-effective in LARC. To increase the probability of being cost-effective, it is crucial to optimize efficient use of both the hybrid OR and the navigation system and identify subgroups where navigation is expected to show higher effectiveness.\n## Background\nRectal cancer is mainly treated by surgical resection, often complemented with pre-and/or postoperative (chemo) radiotherapy in stage II-IV tumors [1][2][3], showing a 5-year survival rate of ~ 45% for stage III and ~ 20% for stage IV tumors [4]. Surgical resection of both locally advanced (LARC) and locally recurrent rectal cancer (LRRC) requires special consideration because (1) the disruption of normal anatomical planes and (2) radiotherapy-induced fibrosis can lead to a higher risk of a tumor positive involved circumferential resection margin [1,5]. In this setting, LARC was defined as T3 or T4 tumors extending close to (< 2 mm) or invading the mesorectal fascia, as shown on rectal magnetic resonance imaging. LRRC was defined as rectal cancer that recurred in the pelvic area after earlier treatment. In 10-15% of rectal cancer patients, positive surgical margins are found [6,7] which negatively affects the prognosis [8][9][10]. Local recurrence can cause debilitating symptoms, and often requires additional treatment, such as chemoradiotherapy and radiotherapy. Optimizing surgical practice and decreasing the risk of positive resection margins is therefore of great clinical and financial importance. \n\nMultiple technologies have emerged to improve the quality of surgery and surgical outcomes [11]. The Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI-AVL) has developed an image-guided navigation system to improve tumor localization during the operative procedure and prevent damage to surrounding vital structures [12]. Recently, this navigation system has been evaluated in the first series of LARC and LRRC patients, showing substantially improved negative surgical margin rates compared to standard surgery in a historical control group [12]. Since the use of a navigation system is associated with extra costs (e.g. due to extra imaging, the navigation system, and personnel), and hospital budgets are limited, new surgical technologies have to prove themselves in terms of cost-effectiveness to have a chance of reimbursement.",

Lindenberg, A. Kramer, E. Kok, V. Ret\u00e8l, G. Beets, T. Ruers, W. V. van Harten\n## Abstract\nBackground A first pilot study showed that an image-guided navigation system could improve resection margin rates in locally advanced (LARC) and locally recurrent rectal cancer (LRRC) patients. Incremental surgical innovation is often implemented without reimbursement consequences, health economic aspects should however also be taken into account. This study evaluates the early cost-effectiveness of navigated surgery compared to standard surgery in LARC and LRRC. Methods A Markov decision model was constructed to estimate the expected costs and outcomes for navigated and standard surgery. The input parameters were based on pilot data from a prospective (navigation cohort n \u00a0=\u200933) and retrospective (control group n \u00a0=\u2009142) data. Utility values were measured in a comparable group ( n \u00a0=\u200963) through the EQ5D-5L. Additionally, sensitivity and value of information analyses were performed. Results Based on this early evaluation, navigated surgery showed incremental costs of \u20ac3141 and \u20ac2896 in LARC and LRRC. In LARC, navigated surgery resulted in 2.05 Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) vs 2.02 QALYs for standard surgery. For LRRC, we found 1.73 vs 1.67 QALYs respectively. This showed an Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) of \u20ac136.604 for LARC and \u20ac52.510 for LRRC per QALY gained. In scenario analyses, optimal utilization rates of the navigation technology lowered the ICER to \u20ac61.817 and \u20ac21.334 for LARC and LRRC. The ICERs of both indications were most sensitive to uncertainty surrounding the risk of progression in the first year after surgery, the risk of having a positive surgical\u00a0margin, and the costs of the navigation system. Conclusion Adding navigation system use is expected to be cost-effective in LRRC and has the potential to become cost-effective in LARC. To increase the probability of being cost-effective, it is crucial to optimize efficient use of both the hybrid OR and the navigation system and identify subgroups where navigation is expected to show higher effectiveness.\n## Background\nRectal cancer is mainly treated by surgical resection, often complemented with pre-and/or postoperative (chemo) radiotherapy in stage II-IV tumors [1][2][3], showing a 5-year survival rate of ~ 45% for stage III and ~ 20% for stage IV tumors [4]. Surgical resection of both locally advanced (LARC) and locally recurrent rectal cancer (LRRC) requires special consideration because (1) the disruption of normal anatomical planes and (2) radiotherapy-induced fibrosis can lead to a higher risk of a tumor positive involved circumferential resection margin [1,5]. In this setting, LARC was defined as T3 or T4 tumors extending close to (< 2 mm) or invading the mesorectal fascia, as shown on rectal magnetic resonance imaging. LRRC was defined as rectal cancer that recurred in the pelvic area after earlier treatment. In 10-15% of rectal cancer patients, positive surgical margins are found [6,7] which negatively affects the prognosis [8][9][10]. Local recurrence can cause debilitating symptoms, and often requires additional treatment, such as chemoradiotherapy and radiotherapy. Optimizing surgical practice and decreasing the risk of positive resection margins is therefore of great clinical and financial importance. \n\nMultiple technologies have emerged to improve the quality of surgery and surgical outcomes [11]. The Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI-AVL) has developed an image-guided navigation system to improve tumor localization during the operative procedure and prevent damage to surrounding vital structures [12]. Recently, this navigation system has been evaluated in the first series of LARC and LRRC patients, showing substantially improved negative surgical margin rates compared to standard surgery in a historical control group [12]. Since the use of a navigation system is associated with extra costs (e.g. due to extra imaging, the navigation system, and personnel), and hospital budgets are limited, new surgical technologies have to prove themselves in terms of cost-effectiveness to have a chance of reimbursement.",

Using a tumor-targeting agent with both a radioactive and a fluorescent label allows us to combine the benefits of two imaging modalities; preoperative nuclear imaging for tumor localization and intraoperative fluorescence imaging for precise and real-time visualization of tumor tissue during surgery. The gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) is a promising target for this application because of its overexpression in several solid tumors, e.g., prostate and breast cancers. In this study, a full preclinical characterization of four previously developed GRPR-targeting dual-modality probes is presented, including the characterization of the biodistribution profile, selection of the optimal probe and a proof-of-concept for image-guided surgery. This project is the first comprehensive investigation of the effect of linker modifications and administered dose on the in vivo behavior of GRPR-targeting dual-modality probes, and provides a basis for clinical translation. Abstract Image-guided surgery using a gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR)-targeting dual-modality probe could improve the accuracy of the resection of various solid tumors. The aim of this study was to further characterize our four previously developed GRPR-targeting dual-modality probes that vary in linker structures and were labeled with indium-111 and sulfo-cyanine 5. Cell uptake studies with GRPR-positive PC-3 cells and GRPR-negative NCI-H69 cells confirmed receptor specificity. Imaging and biodistribution studies at 4 and 24 h with 20 MBq/1 nmol [111In]In-12-15 were performed in nude mice bearing a PC-3 and NCI-H69 xenograft, and showed that the probe with only a pADA linker in the backbone had the highest tumor-to-organ ratios (T/O) at 24 h after injection (T/O > 5 for, e.g., prostate, muscle and blood). For this probe, a dose optimization study with three doses (0.75, 1.25 and 1.75 nmol; 20 MBq) revealed that the maximum image contrast was achieved with the lowest dose. Subsequently, the probe was successfully used for tumor excision in a simulated image-guided surgery setting. Moreover, it demonstrated binding to tissue sections of human prostate, breast and gastro-intestinal stromal tumors. In summary, our findings demonstrate that the developed dual-modality probe has the potential to aid in the complete surgical removal of GRPR-positive tumors.",

Surgery is the most common treatment for these cancers, and complete tumor resection is fundamental to its success. However, one of the greatest challenges for surgeons is to identify tumor boundaries intraoperatively. For prostate cancer, for example, the percentage of resected specimens with cancer cells present at the resection border is, on average, as high as 21.03% [2]. These positive surgical margins have been associated with an increased risk of tumor recurrence and a consequent increased administration of adjuvant treatments [3][4][5]. \n\nHence, there is an important need to improve the accuracy of tumor resection. \n\nOne strategy that has been proposed to aid tumor identification and delineation is image-guided surgery [6]. A breakthrough in this field is the recent FDA approval of the first tumor-targeting agent for fluorescence-guided surgery, commercially called CYTALUX. The intraoperative use of CYTALUX revealed additional lesions in 27% of ovarian cancer patients that would otherwise have been missed, clearly illustrating the benefit of imageguided surgery [7]. However, fluorescence imaging is unfortunately limited by penetration depth, and, therefore, the combined use of nuclear and optical imaging modalities has been proposed as a strategy to further improve surgical navigation. This dual-modality concept is based on both preoperative and intraoperative illumination of cancerous tissue. Nuclear imaging has proved to be a highly sensitive technique for preoperatively detecting cancer, and the radioisotope can additionally be used to locate deeper lesions intraoperatively [8]. Complementary to this, intraoperative optical imaging can improve the surgical view of tumor boundaries in real time. Accordingly, dual-modality nuclear/fluorescent imaging probes would potentially possess the excellent sensitivity and high penetration depth of nuclear imaging and the high, but shallow, resolution and real-time visualization capability of fluorescence imaging in a single agent [9].",

Verhoeven, Maryana Handula, Lilian van den Brink, C. de Ridder, D. Stuurman, Y. Seimbille, S. Dalm\n## Abstract\nSimple Summary Image-guided surgery is a technique that can help the surgeon detect and remove tumors more precisely. Using a tumor-targeting agent with both a radioactive and a fluorescent label allows us to combine the benefits of two imaging modalities; preoperative nuclear imaging for tumor localization and intraoperative fluorescence imaging for precise and real-time visualization of tumor tissue during surgery. The gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) is a promising target for this application because of its overexpression in several solid tumors, e.g., prostate and breast cancers. In this study, a full preclinical characterization of four previously developed GRPR-targeting dual-modality probes is presented, including the characterization of the biodistribution profile, selection of the optimal probe and a proof-of-concept for image-guided surgery. This project is the first comprehensive investigation of the effect of linker modifications and administered dose on the in vivo behavior of GRPR-targeting dual-modality probes, and provides a basis for clinical translation. Abstract Image-guided surgery using a gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR)-targeting dual-modality probe could improve the accuracy of the resection of various solid tumors. The aim of this study was to further characterize our four previously developed GRPR-targeting dual-modality probes that vary in linker structures and were labeled with indium-111 and sulfo-cyanine 5. Cell uptake studies with GRPR-positive PC-3 cells and GRPR-negative NCI-H69 cells confirmed receptor specificity. Imaging and biodistribution studies at 4 and 24 h with 20 MBq/1 nmol [111In]In-12-15 were performed in nude mice bearing a PC-3 and NCI-H69 xenograft, and showed that the probe with only a pADA linker in the backbone had the highest tumor-to-organ ratios (T/O) at 24 h after injection (T/O > 5 for, e.g., prostate, muscle and blood). For this probe, a dose optimization study with three doses (0.75, 1.25 and 1.75 nmol; 20 MBq) revealed that the maximum image contrast was achieved with the lowest dose. Subsequently, the probe was successfully used for tumor excision in a simulated image-guided surgery setting. Moreover, it demonstrated binding to tissue sections of human prostate, breast and gastro-intestinal stromal tumors. In summary, our findings demonstrate that the developed dual-modality probe has the potential to aid in the complete surgical removal of GRPR-positive tumors.\n## Introduction\nAmong cancer types, solid cancers have the highest incidence, with breast, lung and prostate cancer accounting for nearly a third of all newly diagnosed cases in 2020 [1]. Surgery is the most common treatment for these cancers, and complete tumor resection is fundamental to its success. However, one of the greatest challenges for surgeons is to identify tumor boundaries intraoperatively. For prostate cancer, for example, the percentage of resected specimens with cancer cells present at the resection border is, on average, as high as 21.03% [2]. These positive surgical margins have been associated with an increased risk of tumor recurrence and a consequent increased administration of adjuvant treatments [3][4][5]. \n\nHence, there is an important need to improve the accuracy of tumor resection. \n\nOne strategy that has been proposed to aid tumor identification and delineation is image-guided surgery [6]. A breakthrough in this field is the recent FDA approval of the first tumor-targeting agent for fluorescence-guided surgery, commercially called CYTALUX. The intraoperative use of CYTALUX revealed additional lesions in 27% of ovarian cancer patients that would otherwise have been missed, clearly illustrating the benefit of imageguided surgery [7]. However, fluorescence imaging is unfortunately limited by penetration depth, and, therefore, the combined use of nuclear and optical imaging modalities has been proposed as a strategy to further improve surgical navigation. This dual-modality concept is based on both preoperative and intraoperative illumination of cancerous tissue. Nuclear imaging has proved to be a highly sensitive technique for preoperatively detecting cancer, and the radioisotope can additionally be used to locate deeper lesions intraoperatively [8]. Complementary to this, intraoperative optical imaging can improve the surgical view of tumor boundaries in real time. Accordingly, dual-modality nuclear/fluorescent imaging probes would potentially possess the excellent sensitivity and high penetration depth of nuclear imaging and the high, but shallow, resolution and real-time visualization capability of fluorescence imaging in a single agent [9].",

The application of fluorescence image-guided surgery (FIGS) allows for the increased intraoperative visualization and delineation of malignant lesions by using fluorescently labeled targeting biomarkers, thereby improving intraoperative guidance. CD24, a small glycophosphatidylinositol-anchored cell surface receptor, is overexpressed in approximately 70% of solid cancers, and has been proposed as a prognostic and therapeutic tumor-specific biomarker for EOC. Recently, preclinical studies have demonstrated the benefit of CD24-targeted contrast agents for non-invasive fluorescence imaging, as well as improved tumor resection by employing CD24-targeted FIGS in orthotopic patient-derived xenograft models of EOC. The successful detection of miniscule metastases denotes CD24 as a promising biomarker for the application of fluorescence-guided surgery in EOC patients. The aim of this review is to present the clinical and preclinically evaluated biomarkers for ovarian cancer FIGS, highlight the strengths of CD24, and propose a future bimodal approach combining CD24-targeted fluorescence imaging with radionuclide detection and targeted therapy.",

                    "text": "The aggressive surgical approach used to treat metastatic ovarian cancer is unique and remains one of the therapeutic keystones, with the aim of achieving curative treatment. The overall survival rate for epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is below 50%, mainly because the lack of early symptoms leads to a late diagnosis in almost 75% of patients, followed by limited treatment options and emerging drug resistance [1]. In 1975, Thomas Griffith was the first to show that besides the histological subtype, the extent of residual disease after surgery impacts patient outcome [2]. The extent of residual disease is classified into complete cytoreduction (0 cm) and macroscopic residual disease, which is further subclassified into optimal (<1 cm) and suboptimal (>1 cm) cytoreduction [3]. The impact of complete debulking has been confirmed in many trials as the most important prognostic factor for the survival of EOC patients, and it has been suggested to increase the efficacy of subsequent drug therapies [3][4][5]. Clinical trials have also indicated that if macroscopic residual disease remains after surgery, the patient has no significant benefit compared to those who received suboptimal debulking, highlighting the need for better tools to help surgeons achieve complete resection. \n\nIn clinical reality, complete debulking is not always feasible and can be challenging because of aggressive tumor biology, histological subtype, advanced disease stage, and unresectable tumors near vital structures [6][7][8]. To detect submillimeter and residual tumor lesions, the surgeon relies on tactile and visual inspection, training, and experience. New technologies for preoperative planning are warranted to help identify patients who will benefit from surgery, and for these patients, intraoperative guidance methods to help achieve complete debulking are crucial for their survival. \n\nOne surgical technology that was developed to meet these criteria is fluorescence image-guided surgery (FIGS). FIGS employs fluorescent molecules (fluorophores) as contrast agents, and together with specialized imaging systems, the surgeon is provided with a screen image highlighting fluorescent tumor tissue in the operating field.",

Kleinmanns, V. Fosse, L. Bj\u00f8rge, E. McCormack\n## Abstract\nComplete cytoreductive surgery is the cornerstone of the treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). The application of fluorescence image-guided surgery (FIGS) allows for the increased intraoperative visualization and delineation of malignant lesions by using fluorescently labeled targeting biomarkers, thereby improving intraoperative guidance. CD24, a small glycophosphatidylinositol-anchored cell surface receptor, is overexpressed in approximately 70% of solid cancers, and has been proposed as a prognostic and therapeutic tumor-specific biomarker for EOC. Recently, preclinical studies have demonstrated the benefit of CD24-targeted contrast agents for non-invasive fluorescence imaging, as well as improved tumor resection by employing CD24-targeted FIGS in orthotopic patient-derived xenograft models of EOC. The successful detection of miniscule metastases denotes CD24 as a promising biomarker for the application of fluorescence-guided surgery in EOC patients. The aim of this review is to present the clinical and preclinically evaluated biomarkers for ovarian cancer FIGS, highlight the strengths of CD24, and propose a future bimodal approach combining CD24-targeted fluorescence imaging with radionuclide detection and targeted therapy.\n## Introduction\nThe aggressive surgical approach used to treat metastatic ovarian cancer is unique and remains one of the therapeutic keystones, with the aim of achieving curative treatment. The overall survival rate for epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is below 50%, mainly because the lack of early symptoms leads to a late diagnosis in almost 75% of patients, followed by limited treatment options and emerging drug resistance [1]. In 1975, Thomas Griffith was the first to show that besides the histological subtype, the extent of residual disease after surgery impacts patient outcome [2]. The extent of residual disease is classified into complete cytoreduction (0 cm) and macroscopic residual disease, which is further subclassified into optimal (<1 cm) and suboptimal (>1 cm) cytoreduction [3]. The impact of complete debulking has been confirmed in many trials as the most important prognostic factor for the survival of EOC patients, and it has been suggested to increase the efficacy of subsequent drug therapies [3][4][5]. Clinical trials have also indicated that if macroscopic residual disease remains after surgery, the patient has no significant benefit compared to those who received suboptimal debulking, highlighting the need for better tools to help surgeons achieve complete resection. \n\nIn clinical reality, complete debulking is not always feasible and can be challenging because of aggressive tumor biology, histological subtype, advanced disease stage, and unresectable tumors near vital structures [6][7][8]. To detect submillimeter and residual tumor lesions, the surgeon relies on tactile and visual inspection, training, and experience. New technologies for preoperative planning are warranted to help identify patients who will benefit from surgery, and for these patients, intraoperative guidance methods to help achieve complete debulking are crucial for their survival. \n\nOne surgical technology that was developed to meet these criteria is fluorescence image-guided surgery (FIGS). FIGS employs fluorescent molecules (fluorophores) as contrast agents, and together with specialized imaging systems, the surgeon is provided with a screen image highlighting fluorescent tumor tissue in the operating field.",

            "abstract": "Simple Summary Colorectal cancer is the fourth most common type of cancer globally. Approximately 20% of patients with colorectal cancer present with synchronous liver metastases, and up to 60% will develop metachronous metastases during the course of the disease. Although liver resection is currently considered the local treatment of choice for colorectal liver metastasis (CLM), less than one-third of patients are eligible for surgery at the time of diagnosis of CLM. Ablation is a well-established, less invasive, locoregional therapy for patients with small CLMs, which has shown favorable oncological outcomes in patients with unresectable CLMs, comparable to those in patients eligible for surgery. The increasing knowledge of factors affecting oncological outcomes has allowed selected patients with resectable small volume CLMs to be treated with thermal ablation with curative intent. The continuous technological evolutions in imaging and image guidance have contributed to this paradigm shift in CLM treatment. The importance of patient selection, patient factors, tumor factors, ablation techniques, and clinical applications is discussed in this article. Abstract Image-guided ablation can provide effective local tumor control in selected patients with CLM. A randomized controlled trial suggested that radiofrequency ablation combined with systemic chemotherapy resulted in a survival benefit for patients with unresectable CLM, compared to systemic chemotherapy alone. For small tumors, ablation with adequate margins can be considered as an alternative to resection.

Non-disseminated NSCLC is mainly treated with surgical resection. The intraoperative detection of lung cancer can be challenging, since small and deeply located pulmonary nodules can be invisible under white light. Due to the increasing use of minimally invasive surgical techniques, tactile information is often reduced. Therefore, several intraoperative imaging techniques have been tested to localize pulmonary nodules, of which near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence is an emerging modality. In this systematic review, the available literature on fluorescence imaging of lung cancers is presented, which shows that NIR fluorescence-guided lung surgery has the potential to identify the tumor during surgery, detect additional lesions and prevent tumor-positive resection margins.",

Two main histological classes of lung cancer exist: small-cell lung carcinomas (SCLCs) and non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs). Surgical resection is the cornerstone in the curative-intended treatment of non-disseminated NSCLCs [2]. The primary goal in surgical oncology treatment is to achieve a complete resection of the tumor (R0). Incomplete surgical resection of the tumor (R1 or R2) occurs in 2.8-12.7% of patients and is associated with significantly worse survival and higher recurrence rates [3][4][5][6]. In the past, lung resections were mostly performed via thoracotomy. To improve recovery and postoperative pain, there has been a shift from open to minimally invasive surgery (video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery and robotic-assisted thoracoscopic surgery) [7]. A limitation of these surgical techniques is reduced tactile feedback. With the advent of lung cancer screening programs, it is expected that in the near future, more resections will be performed for small nodules, which can be hard to identify during (minimally invasive) surgery [8]. These small-size pulmonary nodules can be operated on with lung-parenchyma-sparing operations (i.e., segmentectomy), with good clinical and oncological outcomes [9]. There is a need for improved preoperative and/or intraoperative imaging techniques to both localize lung nodules and guarantee R0 resections. \n\nVarious preoperative techniques facilitating image-guided localization of pulmonary nodules during surgical resection have been described. This includes several computed tomography (CT)-guided modalities, such as 3D planning, preoperative placement of hook wires, microcoils, fiducials, or radiotracers [10][11][12][13]. These techniques can help in localizing the lesion but commonly have insufficient resolution to determine resection margins.",

A. N. de Myunck, O. Bijlstra, P. Kuppen, D. Hilling, F. Borm, D. Cohen, J. Mieog, W. Steup, J. Braun, J. Burggraaf, A. Vahrmeijer, M. Hutteman\n## Abstract\nLung cancer is the most common cancer type worldwide, with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) being the most common subtype. Non-disseminated NSCLC is mainly treated with surgical resection. The intraoperative detection of lung cancer can be challenging, since small and deeply located pulmonary nodules can be invisible under white light. Due to the increasing use of minimally invasive surgical techniques, tactile information is often reduced. Therefore, several intraoperative imaging techniques have been tested to localize pulmonary nodules, of which near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence is an emerging modality. In this systematic review, the available literature on fluorescence imaging of lung cancers is presented, which shows that NIR fluorescence-guided lung surgery has the potential to identify the tumor during surgery, detect additional lesions and prevent tumor-positive resection margins.\n## Introduction\nLung cancer is the most common cancer type worldwide [1]. Two main histological classes of lung cancer exist: small-cell lung carcinomas (SCLCs) and non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs). Surgical resection is the cornerstone in the curative-intended treatment of non-disseminated NSCLCs [2]. The primary goal in surgical oncology treatment is to achieve a complete resection of the tumor (R0). Incomplete surgical resection of the tumor (R1 or R2) occurs in 2.8-12.7% of patients and is associated with significantly worse survival and higher recurrence rates [3][4][5][6]. In the past, lung resections were mostly performed via thoracotomy. To improve recovery and postoperative pain, there has been a shift from open to minimally invasive surgery (video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery and robotic-assisted thoracoscopic surgery) [7]. A limitation of these surgical techniques is reduced tactile feedback. With the advent of lung cancer screening programs, it is expected that in the near future, more resections will be performed for small nodules, which can be hard to identify during (minimally invasive) surgery [8]. These small-size pulmonary nodules can be operated on with lung-parenchyma-sparing operations (i.e., segmentectomy), with good clinical and oncological outcomes [9]. There is a need for improved preoperative and/or intraoperative imaging techniques to both localize lung nodules and guarantee R0 resections. \n\nVarious preoperative techniques facilitating image-guided localization of pulmonary nodules during surgical resection have been described. This includes several computed tomography (CT)-guided modalities, such as 3D planning, preoperative placement of hook wires, microcoils, fiducials, or radiotracers [10][11][12][13]. These techniques can help in localizing the lesion but commonly have insufficient resolution to determine resection margins.",

The reported efficacy of FUS ablation as measured by percentages of complete tumour necrosis ranged from 20% to 100%. The difference in outcome between FUS ablation studies can be explained by differences in patient selection, imaging techniques, and tumour ablation protocols used. Although the results of US-guided and MRI-guided FUS ablation are promising, the data are too scant to justify a randomized controlled trial that compares FUS ablation with breastconserving surgery for treatment of localized breast cancer. To date, MRI-guided treatment protocols of breast tumours offer the most accurate imaging technique for breast tumour targeting, breast tumour delineation, treatment monitoring (including temperature mapping), and detection of residual disease after treatment. The next step towards clinical implementation of FUS for breast tumour ablation would be a large prospective treat-and-resect study that assesses the therapeutic efficacy of MRI-guided FUS ablation in patients with small (<2 cm) solitary breast cancers and provides data that can be used for technique standardization and guideline formulation. In addition, FUS for anti-tumour immune response induction, controlled transgene expression, and targeted drugs delivery in breast cancer patients should be explored. Currently, breast-conserving surgery remains the gold standard for breast cancer treatment. \n\nOpen Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Noncommercial License which permits any noncommercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author(s) and source are credited.",

Currently, breast-conserving surgery remains the gold standard for breast cancer treatment.\n## Conclusion\nFUS ablation has the potential to become an important modality for non-invasive image-guided treatment of localized breast cancer. Multiple phase I studies have proven MRI-guided and US-guided FUS ablation of breast cancer to be technically feasible and safe. The reported efficacy of FUS ablation as measured by percentages of complete tumour necrosis ranged from 20% to 100%. The difference in outcome between FUS ablation studies can be explained by differences in patient selection, imaging techniques, and tumour ablation protocols used. Although the results of US-guided and MRI-guided FUS ablation are promising, the data are too scant to justify a randomized controlled trial that compares FUS ablation with breastconserving surgery for treatment of localized breast cancer. To date, MRI-guided treatment protocols of breast tumours offer the most accurate imaging technique for breast tumour targeting, breast tumour delineation, treatment monitoring (including temperature mapping), and detection of residual disease after treatment. The next step towards clinical implementation of FUS for breast tumour ablation would be a large prospective treat-and-resect study that assesses the therapeutic efficacy of MRI-guided FUS ablation in patients with small (<2 cm) solitary breast cancers and provides data that can be used for technique standardization and guideline formulation. In addition, FUS for anti-tumour immune response induction, controlled transgene expression, and targeted drugs delivery in breast cancer patients should be explored. Currently, breast-conserving surgery remains the gold standard for breast cancer treatment. \n\nOpen Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Noncommercial License which permits any noncommercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author(s) and source are credited.",

Methods and Materials A retrospective analysis was performed on 97 consecutive patients with LACC treated with 44.0\u201350.4 Gy external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) \u00b1 concurrent platinum-containing chemotherapy followed by 4 \u00d7 7 Gy MR-IGABT between September 2014 and April 2019. Intracavitary (IC)/interstitial (IS)/hybrid intracavitary and interstitial (IC/IS) brachytherapy was used in MR-IGABT. Brachytherapy planning and dose reporting followed the GEC-ESTRO recommendations. Clinical outcomes including overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), progression-free survival (PFS), local control (LC), and treatment-related toxicity evaluated by the RTOG criteria were analyzed. Kaplan\u2013Meier and univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses were used to analyze the prognostic factor. Results Median follow-up was 21.1 months. Median dose to 90% (D90) of the high-risk clinical target volume (HR-CTV) was 91.7 Gy (range 76.7~107.2 Gy). Two-year OS, CSS, PFS, and LC were 83.5%, 84.1%, 71.1%, and 94.8%, respectively. Four patients (4.1%) suffered from grade 3 late gastrointestinal radiation toxicity, and no other grade 3 or greater radiation toxicity occurred. Initial HR-CTV was an independent factor of OS (p = 0.001, HR = 1.018/cm3), PFS (p = 0.012, HR = 1.012/cm3), and LC (p = 0.011, HR = 1.028/cm3). The HR-CTV D90 (p = 0.044, HR = 0.923/Gy) was an independent factor of PFS. Age was an independent factor of LC (p = 0.010, HR = 1.111/year). Conclusion For patients with LACC, MR-IGABT was effective and safe. It showed favorable LC, OS, and minimal toxicity. Moreover, initial HR-CTV, HR-CTV D90, and age were significant prognostic factors.",

                    "text": "In global cancer statistics, cervical cancer ranks fourth for both incidence and mortality in women (1). In China, cervical cancer had a significant upward trend in age-standardized incidence rates (2).\n\nStages IB2, IIA2, IIB, IIIA, IIIB, and IVA (FIGO 2009) cervical cancers are all locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC). To treat this type of cervical cancer, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines recommend the external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), concurrent platinum-containing chemotherapy, and brachytherapy (category 1) (3). As a critical component of the definitive radiation therapy, brachytherapy technology has been rapidly developing in recent years. In consideration of significant changes in the tumor regresses and the topography of the target and organs at risk during the course of treatment (4), image-guided adaptive brachytherapy (IGABT) became an individualized treatment method for patients with LACC. IGABT improves overall survival (OS) and generates a high rate of local tumor control (LC) with a moderate rate of treatment-related morbidity (5)(6)(7)(8). IGABT has been developing particularly in Europe, North America, and Asia (9).\n\nThe preferred imaging technologies for IGABT for LACC are CT and MRI. Compared with CT, advantages of MRI lie in the soft tissue contrast and in discrimination of cervical cancer from normal uterine and adjacent tissue (10). This helps to define the tumor shrinkage and topography after EBRT (11). The NCCN guidelines recommend MRI as the best imaging modality to determine soft tissue and parametrial involvement in patients with advanced tumors (3). Even so, it is difficult for every institution to gain MRI access for each individual brachytherapy fraction (7,(12)(13)(14)(15)(16)(17). Due to the limited MRI availability, some institutions use MRI only in some of the brachytherapy fractions (12,(16)(17)(18). The use of MRI-guided adaptive brachytherapy (MR-IGABT) in each fraction is still limited (18). The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcomes of MR-",

Chi, Ying Pan, Ning Zhang, Dongmei Han, Xin Guo, Zhuang Mao, G. Cheng\n## Abstract\nPurpose This study aims to evaluate clinical outcomes of MRI-guided adaptive brachytherapy (MR-IGABT) for each brachytherapy fraction in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC). Methods and Materials A retrospective analysis was performed on 97 consecutive patients with LACC treated with 44.0\u201350.4 Gy external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) \u00b1 concurrent platinum-containing chemotherapy followed by 4 \u00d7 7 Gy MR-IGABT between September 2014 and April 2019. Intracavitary (IC)/interstitial (IS)/hybrid intracavitary and interstitial (IC/IS) brachytherapy was used in MR-IGABT. Brachytherapy planning and dose reporting followed the GEC-ESTRO recommendations. Clinical outcomes including overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), progression-free survival (PFS), local control (LC), and treatment-related toxicity evaluated by the RTOG criteria were analyzed. Kaplan\u2013Meier and univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses were used to analyze the prognostic factor. Results Median follow-up was 21.1 months. Median dose to 90% (D90) of the high-risk clinical target volume (HR-CTV) was 91.7 Gy (range 76.7~107.2 Gy). Two-year OS, CSS, PFS, and LC were 83.5%, 84.1%, 71.1%, and 94.8%, respectively. Four patients (4.1%) suffered from grade 3 late gastrointestinal radiation toxicity, and no other grade 3 or greater radiation toxicity occurred. Initial HR-CTV was an independent factor of OS (p = 0.001, HR = 1.018/cm3), PFS (p = 0.012, HR = 1.012/cm3), and LC (p = 0.011, HR = 1.028/cm3). The HR-CTV D90 (p = 0.044, HR = 0.923/Gy) was an independent factor of PFS. Age was an independent factor of LC (p = 0.010, HR = 1.111/year). Conclusion For patients with LACC, MR-IGABT was effective and safe. It showed favorable LC, OS, and minimal toxicity. Moreover, initial HR-CTV, HR-CTV D90, and age were significant prognostic factors.\n## INTRODUCTION\nIn global cancer statistics, cervical cancer ranks fourth for both incidence and mortality in women (1). In China, cervical cancer had a significant upward trend in age-standardized incidence rates (2).\n\nStages IB2, IIA2, IIB, IIIA, IIIB, and IVA (FIGO 2009) cervical cancers are all locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC). To treat this type of cervical cancer, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines recommend the external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), concurrent platinum-containing chemotherapy, and brachytherapy (category 1) (3). As a critical component of the definitive radiation therapy, brachytherapy technology has been rapidly developing in recent years. In consideration of significant changes in the tumor regresses and the topography of the target and organs at risk during the course of treatment (4), image-guided adaptive brachytherapy (IGABT) became an individualized treatment method for patients with LACC. IGABT improves overall survival (OS) and generates a high rate of local tumor control (LC) with a moderate rate of treatment-related morbidity (5)(6)(7)(8). IGABT has been developing particularly in Europe, North America, and Asia (9).\n\nThe preferred imaging technologies for IGABT for LACC are CT and MRI. Compared with CT, advantages of MRI lie in the soft tissue contrast and in discrimination of cervical cancer from normal uterine and adjacent tissue (10). This helps to define the tumor shrinkage and topography after EBRT (11). The NCCN guidelines recommend MRI as the best imaging modality to determine soft tissue and parametrial involvement in patients with advanced tumors (3). Even so, it is difficult for every institution to gain MRI access for each individual brachytherapy fraction (7,(12)(13)(14)(15)(16)(17). Due to the limited MRI availability, some institutions use MRI only in some of the brachytherapy fractions (12,(16)(17)(18). The use of MRI-guided adaptive brachytherapy (MR-IGABT) in each fraction is still limited (18). The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcomes of MR-",

One of the primary goals of BCS is to obtain tumor-free resection margins. In practice, the excision of a palpable breast carcinoma is guided by preoperative diagnostic images and the intraoperative tactile skills of the surgeon. The somewhat \u2018blind\u2019 approach of using palpation-guided surgery is known to be highly inaccurate, with studies worldwide reporting positive resection margins in up to 41% of patients. In recent years, ultrasonography has emerged as an effective guidance tool during surgery and ultrasound-guided surgery has been introduced into breast cancer surgery as a method of excising nonpalpable breast cancer. Objective: The aim of this study is comparing ultrasound-guided vs palpation-guided conservative breast surgery in obtaining tumor-free resection margins. Methods: This study was a prospective randomized controlled clinical trial where patients with early breast cancer (T1-T2) and eligible for breast conserving surgery are randomly assigned (1:1) into two arms. Arm A: included the patients who will undergo ultrasound-guided breast conserving surgery. Arm B: included the patients who will undergo the conventional palpation-guided breast conserving surgery. Results: Overall, 142 patients undergoing breast conserving surgery were enrolled: 71 were allocated to the Ultrasound-guided (US) group (Arm A) and 71 to the Palpation-guided (PG) group (Arm B). Patient and tumor characteristics were comparable between the two groups. Age, Body mass index, tumor laterality, tumor location and tumor stage were comparable in both groups and statistically insignificant. Despite that the final tumor size was comparable between both groups, IOUS significantly reduced the main specimen volume and the least negative margin width (p<0.001). The median operative time was significantly longer in the US group bey around 27 min than in the PG group and this was statistically significant in favor of the PG surgery (p<0.001). The involved resection margin rate was significantly higher in the PG group and thus the need for reoperation (p<0.001). Conclusion: IOUS is the only method allowing a true real-time visualization and continuous control of resection margins during all phases of BCS. In our single-institution study, IOUS demonstrated clear superiority over palpation-guided surgery in both oncological and surgical outcomes except for the operative time (smaller excision volume yet, with optimum resection margins). IOUs provides much better tumor localization in small breasts with dense fibroadenosis. Since all the other available localization techniques (including palpation) limit the surgeon\u2019s visual guidance during BCS, IOUS could be regarded as one of the most significant modern technological innovations in the field of breast cancer surgery, restoring sight to the breast surgeon. Our findings strongly suggests that the integration of IOUS in breast conserving surgery could be regarded as a highly beneficial surgical approach.",

The minimally invasive character of these interventions is often reflected in a non penetrative, or less invasive access route, so that many of these interventions can be performed on an outpatient basis or with a significantly reduced hospital stay. Instead of a large incision, at best punctures are required to target and destroy the respective lesion. In cancer therapy, a large number of interventions can already be carried out minimally invasively -unfortunately, experience shows that image-guided MIT are used far too rarely. The most common reason is that MIT are still rarely offered in the oncological therapy routine. Possible reasons for this may be due to the complexity of these therapies, which requires a particular specialization of the interventionalists, on the other hand also a close co-operation of the disciplines involved. In addition to the obvious advantages for the patients, these procedures present new challenges for the treating physician -one can neither directly see nor touch the tumor focus to be treated. Due to the limited exposure of the surgical site or the lack of manual palpation, important information is missing, which must be compensated by exact pretherapeutic planning. Radiologists, radiation therapists and nuclear medicine specialists are traditionally familiar with exactly this type of image-based diagnostics and image-guided therapy, i.e. with the creation of a \"virtual\" site. The core of this planning is an extremely precise imaging with recording of the anatomical, pathological and ideally also functional conditions -practically the creation of a virtual environment that is true to the millimeter. Modern imaging is required for therapy planning, as well as for controlling the intervention itself, documenting the results directly after treatment and, of course, for monitoring the progress of the treatment.",

Kov\u00e1cs, P. Bischoff, H. Haddad, G. Kov\u00e1cs, A. Schaefer, Willi Zhou, M. Pinkawa\n## Abstract\nMinimal-invasive interventions considerably extend the therapeutic spectrum in oncology and open new dimensions in terms of survival, tolerability and patient-friendliness. Through the influence of image-guided interventions, many interdisciplinary therapy concepts have significantly evolved, and this process is by far not yet over. The rapid progression of minimal-invasive technologies offers hope for new therapeutic concepts in the short, medium and long term. Image-guided hybrid-technologies complement and even replace in selected cases classic surgery. In this newly begun era of immune-oncology, interdisciplinary collaboration and the focus on individualized and patient-friendly therapies are crucial.\n## INTERVENTIONAL ONCOLOGY\nThe oligometastatic paradigm hypothesizes that patients with a limited burden of metastases may achieve long-term disease control, survival benefit, or even cure, if the sites of disease can be removed. Although surgery was historically the primary modality used to remove metastases, newer and less-invasive modalities are now available, including stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) and image-guided ablations (4). Therapies are called minimally invasive if the success of the treatment is achieved in a way that is particularly gentle on the patient. The minimally invasive character of these interventions is often reflected in a non penetrative, or less invasive access route, so that many of these interventions can be performed on an outpatient basis or with a significantly reduced hospital stay. Instead of a large incision, at best punctures are required to target and destroy the respective lesion. In cancer therapy, a large number of interventions can already be carried out minimally invasively -unfortunately, experience shows that image-guided MIT are used far too rarely. The most common reason is that MIT are still rarely offered in the oncological therapy routine. Possible reasons for this may be due to the complexity of these therapies, which requires a particular specialization of the interventionalists, on the other hand also a close co-operation of the disciplines involved. In addition to the obvious advantages for the patients, these procedures present new challenges for the treating physician -one can neither directly see nor touch the tumor focus to be treated. Due to the limited exposure of the surgical site or the lack of manual palpation, important information is missing, which must be compensated by exact pretherapeutic planning. Radiologists, radiation therapists and nuclear medicine specialists are traditionally familiar with exactly this type of image-based diagnostics and image-guided therapy, i.e. with the creation of a \"virtual\" site. The core of this planning is an extremely precise imaging with recording of the anatomical, pathological and ideally also functional conditions -practically the creation of a virtual environment that is true to the millimeter. Modern imaging is required for therapy planning, as well as for controlling the intervention itself, documenting the results directly after treatment and, of course, for monitoring the progress of the treatment.",

                    "text": "Breast cancer is primarily treated via surgical excision of the tumour with the surrounding normal breast tissue margin. In the early stage, these treatments take the form of breast-conserving surgery (BCS) or lumpectomy. 1 Although BCS provides satisfactory cosmetic outcomes, the re-resection rate is \u00bb20%, and of these surgeries, \u00bb85% are performed due to the presence of initial positive margins. 2 Although there is often a need for further surgery and additional tissue removal owing to the inherent challenges in achieving negative margins, existing guidelines recommend against excising a wider negative margin in routine practice. 3 Currently, surgeons rely primarily on visual and tactile cues to distinguish between healthy and malignant tissues and thus may leave residual lesions in the tumour bed. 4 MRI, mammography, ultrasound, and CT etc. are readily available imaging modalities typically used to assess the tumour lesion prior to the surgical procedure. Although these traditional imaging modalities have been of immense help in advancing tumour detection and determining the extent of resection(s), 5 the need for accurate intraoperative imaging remains one of the most important unmet needs in the management of breast cancer at the time of the initial BCS. \n\nExtensive research is ongoing to identify new, rapid, and accurate intraoperative margin assessment tools, some of which are currently undergoing clinical testing. 6 For example, among biophotonic-based techniques, image-guided surgery using fluorescence imaging offers many advantages for surgeons. Near-infrared (NIR) imaging is an emerging biomedical imaging modality for fluorescence-guided surgery because of its significant light absorption, ability to assist in real-time visualization, and lack of ionizing radiation. In vivo imaging in the NIR range (700\u00c0900 nm) is superior to that in the visible spectrum owing to its low scattering, negligible tissue autofluorescence, and relatively high tissue penetration. 7 The first FDA-approved NIR dye, indocyanine green (ICG), has been used in clinical practice to determine the liver function, cardiac output, and blood flow etc) for over fifty years due to its proven safety and the feasibility of its use. Also, ICG has been tested for tumour margin identification.",

Ryoo, Samer A. Naffouje, Sunam Mander, K. Christov, Jing Wang, A. Green, A. Shilkaitis, T. K. Das Gupta, Tohru Yamada\n## Abstract\nNone\n## Introduction\nBreast cancer is primarily treated via surgical excision of the tumour with the surrounding normal breast tissue margin. In the early stage, these treatments take the form of breast-conserving surgery (BCS) or lumpectomy. 1 Although BCS provides satisfactory cosmetic outcomes, the re-resection rate is \u00bb20%, and of these surgeries, \u00bb85% are performed due to the presence of initial positive margins. 2 Although there is often a need for further surgery and additional tissue removal owing to the inherent challenges in achieving negative margins, existing guidelines recommend against excising a wider negative margin in routine practice. 3 Currently, surgeons rely primarily on visual and tactile cues to distinguish between healthy and malignant tissues and thus may leave residual lesions in the tumour bed. 4 MRI, mammography, ultrasound, and CT etc. are readily available imaging modalities typically used to assess the tumour lesion prior to the surgical procedure. Although these traditional imaging modalities have been of immense help in advancing tumour detection and determining the extent of resection(s), 5 the need for accurate intraoperative imaging remains one of the most important unmet needs in the management of breast cancer at the time of the initial BCS. \n\nExtensive research is ongoing to identify new, rapid, and accurate intraoperative margin assessment tools, some of which are currently undergoing clinical testing. 6 For example, among biophotonic-based techniques, image-guided surgery using fluorescence imaging offers many advantages for surgeons. Near-infrared (NIR) imaging is an emerging biomedical imaging modality for fluorescence-guided surgery because of its significant light absorption, ability to assist in real-time visualization, and lack of ionizing radiation. In vivo imaging in the NIR range (700\u00c0900 nm) is superior to that in the visible spectrum owing to its low scattering, negligible tissue autofluorescence, and relatively high tissue penetration. 7 The first FDA-approved NIR dye, indocyanine green (ICG), has been used in clinical practice to determine the liver function, cardiac output, and blood flow etc) for over fifty years due to its proven safety and the feasibility of its use. Also, ICG has been tested for tumour margin identification.",

However, paucity of data is available for the performance of these treatments when used with a curative intent. The aim of this study is to investigate the local progression free-survival (LPFS) after radical percutaneous image-guided ablation of BM in oligometastatic patients, and to identify predictive factors associated with local tumor progression. Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective review of all patients who underwent percutaneous image-guided CA or RFA of BM with a radical intent between 2007 and 2018. Results: Forty-six patients with a total of forty-nine BM underwent percutaneous image-guided CA (N\u2009=\u200937; 75,5%) or RFA (N\u2009=\u200912; 24,5%). Primary malignancies included thyroid (N\u2009=\u200911, 22.5%), breast (N\u2009=\u200921; 42.9%), lung (N\u2009=\u20098; 16.3%) and other (N\u2009=\u20099; 18,3%) cancers. Additional consolidation was performed after ablation in 20.4% cases (N\u2009=\u200910). Mean follow-up was 34.1\u2009\u00b1\u200922\u2009months. Local progression at the treated site was observed in 28.5% cases (N\u2009=\u200914); 1- and 2-year LPFS was 76.8% and 71.7%, respectively. Size of BM (>2\u2009cm) predicted local tumor progression (p\u2009=\u2009.002). Conclusions: Percutaneous image-guided locoregional therapies used in the radical treatment of BM in oligometastatic patients demonstrate significant rates of LPFS providing the size of BM \u22642\u2009cm.",

                    "text": "Radical treatment of BM is challenging and often requires an integrated multidisciplinary approach [18][19][20][21]. Surgery and RT have traditionally been the treatment of choice in such a clinical scenario. However, due to patients' pre-existing comorbidities and the fact that surgery often delays systemic treatment, the opportunities of radical surgery have often been narrow [20]. Nowadays, radical surgery is mainly reserved to patients with good life expectancy and PS, very limited burden of systemic disease, and favorable tumor histotype (e.g. thyroid or kidney cancer), especially when the BM is associated with a pathologic or an impending fracture. To achieve effective local tumor control, radical surgery is often combined with RT [22], of which the field of action has progressively increased in the past few years as a result of the introduction of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT); which offers high rate of local tumor control (around 90% at 1-year [23]) and better rates of pain management as compared to standard external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) [24]. Wang et al. reported on 166 mechanically stable, non-cord-compressing spinal BM originating from various primaries in 149 patients undergoing SBRT [25]. Their inclusion criteria was similar to those applied in the present study (e.g. oligometastatic disease, failure of previous conventional RT or surgery, residual tumor after surgery, medical inoperability, and refusal to undergo surgery); and similarly, their oncologic results were analogous to those obtained with percutaneous image-guided ablation in the present series: the rate of local tumor progression reported by Wang et al. is 28% (vs. 28.5% in the present series), resulting in 1-and 2year LPFS 80.5% and 72.4%, respectively (vs. 76.8% and 71.7%, respectively in the present series). \n\nCompared to RT [18], percutaneous image-guided locoregional therapies can achieve effective tumor destruction irrespective of the tumor histology, as confirmed by the similar LPFS rates obtained in the present series among all the different tumor histologies.",

Auloge, P. de Marini, C. Rousseau, J. Chiang, G. Koch, J. Caudrelier, P. Rao, J. Garnon, A. Gangi\n## Abstract\nAbstract Introduction: Percutaneous image-guided cryo- (CA) and radiofrequency- (RFA) ablations have been widely used in the treatment of painful bone metastases (BM). However, paucity of data is available for the performance of these treatments when used with a curative intent. The aim of this study is to investigate the local progression free-survival (LPFS) after radical percutaneous image-guided ablation of BM in oligometastatic patients, and to identify predictive factors associated with local tumor progression. Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective review of all patients who underwent percutaneous image-guided CA or RFA of BM with a radical intent between 2007 and 2018. Results: Forty-six patients with a total of forty-nine BM underwent percutaneous image-guided CA (N\u2009=\u200937; 75,5%) or RFA (N\u2009=\u200912; 24,5%). Primary malignancies included thyroid (N\u2009=\u200911, 22.5%), breast (N\u2009=\u200921; 42.9%), lung (N\u2009=\u20098; 16.3%) and other (N\u2009=\u20099; 18,3%) cancers. Additional consolidation was performed after ablation in 20.4% cases (N\u2009=\u200910). Mean follow-up was 34.1\u2009\u00b1\u200922\u2009months. Local progression at the treated site was observed in 28.5% cases (N\u2009=\u200914); 1- and 2-year LPFS was 76.8% and 71.7%, respectively. Size of BM (>2\u2009cm) predicted local tumor progression (p\u2009=\u2009.002). Conclusions: Percutaneous image-guided locoregional therapies used in the radical treatment of BM in oligometastatic patients demonstrate significant rates of LPFS providing the size of BM \u22642\u2009cm.\n## Discussion\nRadical treatment of BM is challenging and often requires an integrated multidisciplinary approach [18][19][20][21]. Surgery and RT have traditionally been the treatment of choice in such a clinical scenario. However, due to patients' pre-existing comorbidities and the fact that surgery often delays systemic treatment, the opportunities of radical surgery have often been narrow [20]. Nowadays, radical surgery is mainly reserved to patients with good life expectancy and PS, very limited burden of systemic disease, and favorable tumor histotype (e.g. thyroid or kidney cancer), especially when the BM is associated with a pathologic or an impending fracture. To achieve effective local tumor control, radical surgery is often combined with RT [22], of which the field of action has progressively increased in the past few years as a result of the introduction of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT); which offers high rate of local tumor control (around 90% at 1-year [23]) and better rates of pain management as compared to standard external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) [24]. Wang et al. reported on 166 mechanically stable, non-cord-compressing spinal BM originating from various primaries in 149 patients undergoing SBRT [25]. Their inclusion criteria was similar to those applied in the present study (e.g. oligometastatic disease, failure of previous conventional RT or surgery, residual tumor after surgery, medical inoperability, and refusal to undergo surgery); and similarly, their oncologic results were analogous to those obtained with percutaneous image-guided ablation in the present series: the rate of local tumor progression reported by Wang et al. is 28% (vs. 28.5% in the present series), resulting in 1-and 2year LPFS 80.5% and 72.4%, respectively (vs. 76.8% and 71.7%, respectively in the present series). \n\nCompared to RT [18], percutaneous image-guided locoregional therapies can achieve effective tumor destruction irrespective of the tumor histology, as confirmed by the similar LPFS rates obtained in the present series among all the different tumor histologies.",

            "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer is a challenging malignancy with limited treatment options and poor life expectancy. The only curative option is surgical resection, but only 15%-20% of patients are resectable at presentation because more than 50% of patients has distant metastasis at diagnosis and the rest of them has locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC). The standard of care first line treatment for LAPC patients is chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy. Recent developments in minimally invasive ablative techniques may add to the treatment armamentarium of LAPC. There are increasing number of studies evaluating these novel ablative techniques, including radiofrequency ablation, microwave ablation, cryoablation and irreversible electroporation. Most studies which included pancreatic tumor ablation, demonstrated improved overall survival in LAPC patients. However, the exact protocols are yet to set up to which stage of the treatment algorithm ablative techniques can be added and in what kind of treatment combinations. Patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer has dismal prognosis with 5-year survival is only 3%. The most common metastatic site is the liver as 90% of pancreatic cancer patients develop liver metastasis. Chemotherapy is the primary treatment option for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. However, when the tumor is not responding to chemotherapy or severe drug toxicity develops, locoregional liver-directed therapies can provide an opportunity to control intrahepatic disease progression and improve survival in selected patients. During the last decade new therapeutic options arose with the advancement of minimally invasive technologies to treat pancreatic cancer patients. These new therapies have been a topic of increasing interest due to the severe prognostic implications of locally advanced and metastatic pancreatic cancer and the low comorbid risk of these procedures. This review summarizes new ablative options for patients with LAPC and percutaneous liver-directed therapies for patients with liver-dominant metastatic disease.",

Interventional oncology is becoming the fourth pillar of cancer care besides the classic trio of medical oncology, surgery and radiation oncology. The data presented above demonstrates only modest improvement in overall survival of patients with LAPC and patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer, but still this is a significant step forward in the treatment of a disease which has dismal prognosis. In the current medical practice these new minimally invasive treatments are used mostly as salvage therapies, when a patient has no other option. This approach introduces a selection bias into the studies and may mask the real potential of these novel treatment modalities. Despite the selection bias, they have one obvious advantage, the low mortality and morbidity rates of image guided-procedures compared to surgery,   radiation therapy and even to chemotherapy. Interventional oncology has many tools in its armamentarium to manage patients with primary and secondary pancreatic cancer; however, most of the new treatment options are in the experimental phase and only performed by large-volume centers. We are in an era of a paradigm shift from conventional oncology to immunooncology which could promote the concurrent use of ablative technologies together with immune therapies[45, [101][102][103][104]. It has been found that ablation of solid tumors triggers a tumor-specific immune response which can be beneficial in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors or other immune modulator agents. Future studies are needed to define the specific role of interventional oncology in every stages of pancreatic cancer with special attention on the immunological effect of ablative techniques.",

The only curative option is surgical resection, but only 15%-20% of patients are resectable at presentation because more than 50% of patients has distant metastasis at diagnosis and the rest of them has locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC). The standard of care first line treatment for LAPC patients is chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy. Recent developments in minimally invasive ablative techniques may add to the treatment armamentarium of LAPC. There are increasing number of studies evaluating these novel ablative techniques, including radiofrequency ablation, microwave ablation, cryoablation and irreversible electroporation. Most studies which included pancreatic tumor ablation, demonstrated improved overall survival in LAPC patients. However, the exact protocols are yet to set up to which stage of the treatment algorithm ablative techniques can be added and in what kind of treatment combinations. Patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer has dismal prognosis with 5-year survival is only 3%. The most common metastatic site is the liver as 90% of pancreatic cancer patients develop liver metastasis. Chemotherapy is the primary treatment option for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. However, when the tumor is not responding to chemotherapy or severe drug toxicity develops, locoregional liver-directed therapies can provide an opportunity to control intrahepatic disease progression and improve survival in selected patients. During the last decade new therapeutic options arose with the advancement of minimally invasive technologies to treat pancreatic cancer patients. These new therapies have been a topic of increasing interest due to the severe prognostic implications of locally advanced and metastatic pancreatic cancer and the low comorbid risk of these procedures. This review summarizes new ablative options for patients with LAPC and percutaneous liver-directed therapies for patients with liver-dominant metastatic disease.\n## CONCLUSION\nThe introduction of minimally invasive technologies in cancer care opened new therapeutic options for patients with malignancies beyond surgery, chemotherapy and radiation treatment. Interventional oncology is becoming the fourth pillar of cancer care besides the classic trio of medical oncology, surgery and radiation oncology. The data presented above demonstrates only modest improvement in overall survival of patients with LAPC and patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer, but still this is a significant step forward in the treatment of a disease which has dismal prognosis. In the current medical practice these new minimally invasive treatments are used mostly as salvage therapies, when a patient has no other option. This approach introduces a selection bias into the studies and may mask the real potential of these novel treatment modalities. Despite the selection bias, they have one obvious advantage, the low mortality and morbidity rates of image guided-procedures compared to surgery,   radiation therapy and even to chemotherapy. Interventional oncology has many tools in its armamentarium to manage patients with primary and secondary pancreatic cancer; however, most of the new treatment options are in the experimental phase and only performed by large-volume centers. We are in an era of a paradigm shift from conventional oncology to immunooncology which could promote the concurrent use of ablative technologies together with immune therapies[45, [101][102][103][104]. It has been found that ablation of solid tumors triggers a tumor-specific immune response which can be beneficial in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors or other immune modulator agents. Future studies are needed to define the specific role of interventional oncology in every stages of pancreatic cancer with special attention on the immunological effect of ablative techniques.",

            "abstract": "Chest radiography, computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET)-CT are required for staging nonsmall cell lung cancers. Stage I cancers may be up to 4\u2005cm in maximal diameter, with stage IA tumours being up to 3\u2005cm and stage IB up to 4\u2005cm. A lung cancer becomes stage II if the tumour is between 4 and \u22645\u2005cm (stage IIA), or it spreads to ipsilateral peribronchial or hilar lymph nodes (stage IIB). Stage IA tumours should be surgically resected, ideally using minimally invasive methods. Lobectomy is usually performed, although some studies have shown good outcomes for sublobar resections. If surgery is not possible, stereotactic body radiotherapy is a good alternative. This involves delivering a few high-dose radiation treatments at very high precision. For stage IB to IIB disease, combinations of surgery, chemotherapy or immunotherapy and radiotherapy are used. There is evidence that neoadjuvant treatment (immunotherapy with nivolumab and chemotherapy for stage IB and II) optimises outcomes. Adjuvant chemotherapy with a platinum-based doublet (typically cisplatin+vinorelbine) should be offered for resected stage IIB tumours and considered for resected IIA tumours. Adjuvant pembrolizumab is used for stage IB\u2013IIIA following resection and adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy. Osimertinib may be used for resected stage IB to IIIA cancers which have relevant mutations (epidermal growth factor receptor exon 19 deletions or exon 21 (L858R) substitution). There are no fixed guidelines for follow-up, but most centres recommend 6-monthly CT scanning for the first 2\u20133\u2005years after definitive treatment, followed by annual scans. Shareable abstract Chest radiography, CT scan and PET-CT are required for staging NSCLC. Stage IA tumours should be resected. Stereotactic body radiotherapy may be used if surgery is not possible. Stage IB to IIB disease require multimodality approaches. https://bit.ly/3RVbQMu",

For individuals in the very early stage of the disease (stage IA1-IA2), the focus revolves around determining and defining the optimal extent of resection and implementing minimally invasive methods without affecting oncological outcomes. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) has now become the standard of care, rather than open surgery. Many centres are now developing robot-assisted thoracoscopic surgical techniques. For patients with stage IB-IIB disease, there is a significantly higher risk of recurrence. In this context, even though surgery remains pivotal in treatment, there is an emphasis on combining systemic therapy, radiation and surgery safely to achieve maximum benefit through multimodal approaches. \n\nLobectomy has been considered the most effective treatment for early-stage tumours since the Lung Cancer Study Group's publication in 1995, which compared lobectomy with limited resection for stage I NSCLC [26]. However, due to advancements in staging technology and improved understanding of disease biology and subtyping, there is renewed interest in sublobar resections because of increased accuracy and availability of imaging techniques like CT and FDG-PET scans [27]. \n\nOver the past 20 years, several extensive database studies, single-institution retrospective studies and meta-analyses have illustrated the similarity in cancer treatment outcomes between sublobar resection and lobectomy for stage IA NSCLC patients [28][29][30]. Studies have highlighted the significant role of tumour size, grade, and histological subclassification when making a choice between sublobar resection and lobectomy [31,32]. However, conducting retrospective research in this area is associated with limitations due to potential influences from patient comorbidities on the decision-making process regarding the procedure of choice. In addition, there is considerable heterogeneity regarding the surgical definitions and inclusion criteria in the literature.",

Magouliotis, Roberto Chalela, Adam Januszewski, Fabio Dennst\u00e4dt, P. Putora, Alfred So, A. Bhowmik\n## Abstract\nChest radiography, computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET)-CT are required for staging nonsmall cell lung cancers. Stage I cancers may be up to 4\u2005cm in maximal diameter, with stage IA tumours being up to 3\u2005cm and stage IB up to 4\u2005cm. A lung cancer becomes stage II if the tumour is between 4 and \u22645\u2005cm (stage IIA), or it spreads to ipsilateral peribronchial or hilar lymph nodes (stage IIB). Stage IA tumours should be surgically resected, ideally using minimally invasive methods. Lobectomy is usually performed, although some studies have shown good outcomes for sublobar resections. If surgery is not possible, stereotactic body radiotherapy is a good alternative. This involves delivering a few high-dose radiation treatments at very high precision. For stage IB to IIB disease, combinations of surgery, chemotherapy or immunotherapy and radiotherapy are used. There is evidence that neoadjuvant treatment (immunotherapy with nivolumab and chemotherapy for stage IB and II) optimises outcomes. Adjuvant chemotherapy with a platinum-based doublet (typically cisplatin+vinorelbine) should be offered for resected stage IIB tumours and considered for resected IIA tumours. Adjuvant pembrolizumab is used for stage IB\u2013IIIA following resection and adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy. Osimertinib may be used for resected stage IB to IIIA cancers which have relevant mutations (epidermal growth factor receptor exon 19 deletions or exon 21 (L858R) substitution). There are no fixed guidelines for follow-up, but most centres recommend 6-monthly CT scanning for the first 2\u20133\u2005years after definitive treatment, followed by annual scans. Shareable abstract Chest radiography, CT scan and PET-CT are required for staging NSCLC. Stage IA tumours should be resected. Stereotactic body radiotherapy may be used if surgery is not possible. Stage IB to IIB disease require multimodality approaches. https://bit.ly/3RVbQMu\n## Investigations required by stage\nIf there is a high clinical suspicion of nodal involvement and EBUS/EUS yields negative results, clinicians should indicate mediastinoscopy [13]. \n\nSurgical management of NSCLC Patients with early-stage NSCLC are divided into two groups, each with unique clinical and research inquiries. For individuals in the very early stage of the disease (stage IA1-IA2), the focus revolves around determining and defining the optimal extent of resection and implementing minimally invasive methods without affecting oncological outcomes. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) has now become the standard of care, rather than open surgery. Many centres are now developing robot-assisted thoracoscopic surgical techniques. For patients with stage IB-IIB disease, there is a significantly higher risk of recurrence. In this context, even though surgery remains pivotal in treatment, there is an emphasis on combining systemic therapy, radiation and surgery safely to achieve maximum benefit through multimodal approaches. \n\nLobectomy has been considered the most effective treatment for early-stage tumours since the Lung Cancer Study Group's publication in 1995, which compared lobectomy with limited resection for stage I NSCLC [26]. However, due to advancements in staging technology and improved understanding of disease biology and subtyping, there is renewed interest in sublobar resections because of increased accuracy and availability of imaging techniques like CT and FDG-PET scans [27]. \n\nOver the past 20 years, several extensive database studies, single-institution retrospective studies and meta-analyses have illustrated the similarity in cancer treatment outcomes between sublobar resection and lobectomy for stage IA NSCLC patients [28][29][30]. Studies have highlighted the significant role of tumour size, grade, and histological subclassification when making a choice between sublobar resection and lobectomy [31,32]. However, conducting retrospective research in this area is associated with limitations due to potential influences from patient comorbidities on the decision-making process regarding the procedure of choice. In addition, there is considerable heterogeneity regarding the surgical definitions and inclusion criteria in the literature.",

Diagnosis and treatment using precision medicine is expected to be an effective method for preventing the initiation and progression of cancer. Although anatomical and functional imaging techniques such as radiography, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) have played an important role for accurate preoperative diagnostics, for the most part these techniques cannot be applied intraoperatively. Optical molecular imaging is a promising technique that provides a high degree of sensitivity and specificity in tumor margin detection. Furthermore, existing clinical applications have proven that optical molecular imaging is a powerful intraoperative tool for guiding surgeons performing precision procedures, thus enabling radical resection and improved survival rates. However, detection depth limitation exists in optical molecular imaging methods and further breakthroughs from optical to multi-modality intraoperative imaging methods are needed to develop more extensive and comprehensive intraoperative applications. Here, we review the current intraoperative optical molecular imaging technologies, focusing on contrast agents and surgical navigation systems, and then discuss the future prospects of multi-modality imaging technology for intraoperative imaging-guided cancer surgery.",

Intraoperative image-guided cancer surgery using FMI technology may provide the most valuable goal for addressing diseased and abnormal tissues in surgical practice. White-light reflectance supplies insufficient visual information between the tumor and normal tissue, whereas fluorescence can provide additional information to potentially prevent cancer persistence or recurrence, and unacceptable morbidity. Although FMI technology has been of substantial benefit to patient outcomes, much more work is necessary for clinical translation of the rapidly expanding number of targeted agents and imaging systems currently in the research pipeline. \n\nIntraoperative FMI has good performance in clinical applications, and many patients benefit from this method. As penetration depth is a challenge in optical imaging, intraoperative multimodal data fusion (such as adding rescanned CT and/or ultrasonography) provides possible solutions [45,178,179]. These techniques will augment the tools for accurate preoperative diagnosis, such as radiography, CT, MRI, and PET, which will provide important aid in advancing intraoperative FMI detection. Some preclinical results using the NIR imaging technique combined with other imaging methods such as ultrasonography [45], MRI [180] and X-ray CT [178] compensate for the depth issues and have already demonstrated the possibility of using the FMI guided multi-modality method to precisely excise tumors. Zhang et al. declared that tumor metastatic lymph nodes and reactive lymph nodes located in deep-seated area were distinguished with diffusion-weighted and super-paramagnetic iron oxide enhanced MR imaging [181]. Visualization of tumor draining SLNs at distant depths using NIR, MR and PET triple-modal imaging methods was done in a 4T1 tumor metastasis model and provided helpful guidance for SLN mapping and tumor metastasis diagnosis thereby revealing its potential clinical utility [182]. With breakthroughs in computer-aided treatment technology, multi-modality image registration with optical imaging methods has achieved clinical use in intraoperative applications. Through the development of intraoperative image-guided agents and imaging systems in cancer surgery, FMI technology will extend other modality imaging methods into the clinic empowering surgeons to improve patient outcomes.",

Qiu, Jiandong Wang, Jie Tian, Xiaoyuan Chen\n## Abstract\nCancer is a major threat to human health. Diagnosis and treatment using precision medicine is expected to be an effective method for preventing the initiation and progression of cancer. Although anatomical and functional imaging techniques such as radiography, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) have played an important role for accurate preoperative diagnostics, for the most part these techniques cannot be applied intraoperatively. Optical molecular imaging is a promising technique that provides a high degree of sensitivity and specificity in tumor margin detection. Furthermore, existing clinical applications have proven that optical molecular imaging is a powerful intraoperative tool for guiding surgeons performing precision procedures, thus enabling radical resection and improved survival rates. However, detection depth limitation exists in optical molecular imaging methods and further breakthroughs from optical to multi-modality intraoperative imaging methods are needed to develop more extensive and comprehensive intraoperative applications. Here, we review the current intraoperative optical molecular imaging technologies, focusing on contrast agents and surgical navigation systems, and then discuss the future prospects of multi-modality imaging technology for intraoperative imaging-guided cancer surgery.\n## Conclusions and Perspectives\nPrecise medical diagnosis and treatment will approved the ability of surgeons to treat cancer. Intraoperative image-guided cancer surgery using FMI technology may provide the most valuable goal for addressing diseased and abnormal tissues in surgical practice. White-light reflectance supplies insufficient visual information between the tumor and normal tissue, whereas fluorescence can provide additional information to potentially prevent cancer persistence or recurrence, and unacceptable morbidity. Although FMI technology has been of substantial benefit to patient outcomes, much more work is necessary for clinical translation of the rapidly expanding number of targeted agents and imaging systems currently in the research pipeline. \n\nIntraoperative FMI has good performance in clinical applications, and many patients benefit from this method. As penetration depth is a challenge in optical imaging, intraoperative multimodal data fusion (such as adding rescanned CT and/or ultrasonography) provides possible solutions [45,178,179]. These techniques will augment the tools for accurate preoperative diagnosis, such as radiography, CT, MRI, and PET, which will provide important aid in advancing intraoperative FMI detection. Some preclinical results using the NIR imaging technique combined with other imaging methods such as ultrasonography [45], MRI [180] and X-ray CT [178] compensate for the depth issues and have already demonstrated the possibility of using the FMI guided multi-modality method to precisely excise tumors. Zhang et al. declared that tumor metastatic lymph nodes and reactive lymph nodes located in deep-seated area were distinguished with diffusion-weighted and super-paramagnetic iron oxide enhanced MR imaging [181]. Visualization of tumor draining SLNs at distant depths using NIR, MR and PET triple-modal imaging methods was done in a 4T1 tumor metastasis model and provided helpful guidance for SLN mapping and tumor metastasis diagnosis thereby revealing its potential clinical utility [182]. With breakthroughs in computer-aided treatment technology, multi-modality image registration with optical imaging methods has achieved clinical use in intraoperative applications. Through the development of intraoperative image-guided agents and imaging systems in cancer surgery, FMI technology will extend other modality imaging methods into the clinic empowering surgeons to improve patient outcomes.\n...\nThrough the development of intraoperative image-guided agents and imaging systems in cancer surgery, FMI technology will extend other modality imaging methods into the clinic empowering surgeons to improve patient outcomes. \n\nFinally, it is important for surgeons to incorporate intraoperative surgical navigation technology into their practice.

In this study, the accuracy of preoperative VABB specimens was assessed and compared with surgical specimens in patients with triple-negative or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive invasive ductal breast cancer after neoadjuvant therapy. As a secondary endpoint, the performance of contrast-enhanced MRI of the breast and PET\u2013CT for response prediction was assessed. Methods This single-institution prospective pilot study enrolled patients from April 2018 to April 2021 with a complete response on imaging (iCR) who subsequently underwent VABB before surgery. Those with a pCR at VABB were included in the primary analysis of the accuracy of VABB. The performance of imaging (MRI and PET\u2013CT) was analysed for prediction of a pCR considering both patients with an iCR and those with residual disease at postneoadjuvant therapy imaging. Results Twenty patients were included in the primary analysis. The median age was 44 (range 35\u201351) years. At surgery, 18 of 20 patients showed a complete response (accuracy 90 (95 per cent exact c.i. 68 to 99) per cent). Only two patients showed residual ductal intraepithelial neoplasia of grade 2 and 3 respectively. In the secondary analysis, accuracy was similar for MRI and PET\u2013CT (77 versus 78 per cent; P = 0.76). Conclusion VABB in patients with an iCR might be a promising method to select patients for de-escalation of surgical treatment in triple-negative or HER2-positive breast cancer. The present results support such an approach and should inform the design of future trials on de-escalation of surgery.",

In this study, the accuracy of preoperative VABB specimens was assessed and compared with surgical specimens in patients with triple-negative or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive invasive ductal breast cancer after neoadjuvant therapy. As a secondary endpoint, the performance of contrast-enhanced MRI of the breast and PET\u2013CT for response prediction was assessed. Methods This single-institution prospective pilot study enrolled patients from April 2018 to April 2021 with a complete response on imaging (iCR) who subsequently underwent VABB before surgery. Those with a pCR at VABB were included in the primary analysis of the accuracy of VABB. The performance of imaging (MRI and PET\u2013CT) was analysed for prediction of a pCR considering both patients with an iCR and those with residual disease at postneoadjuvant therapy imaging. Results Twenty patients were included in the primary analysis. The median age was 44 (range 35\u201351) years. At surgery, 18 of 20 patients showed a complete response (accuracy 90 (95 per cent exact c.i. 68 to 99) per cent). Only two patients showed residual ductal intraepithelial neoplasia of grade 2 and 3 respectively. In the secondary analysis, accuracy was similar for MRI and PET\u2013CT (77 versus 78 per cent; P = 0.76). Conclusion VABB in patients with an iCR might be a promising method to select patients for de-escalation of surgical treatment in triple-negative or HER2-positive breast cancer. The present results support such an approach and should inform the design of future trials on de-escalation of surgery.\n## Discussion\nIn the present study, NAT was chosen by the multidisciplinary team to downstage the cancer depending on the biological subtype, with the aim of providing less invasive surgery, reducing postoperative complications, and improving cosmetic outcomes. The expanded use and improved efficacy of NAT for the management of triple-negative and HER2-positive breast cancer have led to increasing numbers of patients with no detectable residual disease at the time of surgery 38 . In such patients, a pCR is associated with a low risk of locoregional recurrence and better overall survival 8,9,22,38,39 . It was shown here that ultrasound-guided VABB, used in concert with other imaging modalities, can reliably identify a pCR in patients with triple-negative or HER2-positive breast cancer. Values in parentheses are 95% exact confidence intervals. The analysis included 50 patients: 22 with an imaging complete response (2 with residual disease at vacuum-assisted breast biopsy (VABB) and 20 with a complete response at VABB included in primary analysis) and 28 with residual disease at postneoadjuvant therapy imaging. *Three patients had missing information on MRI. \u2020Five patients had missing information on PET. \n\nIn recent decades, the widespread adoption of NAT has facilitated increased use of breast-conserving surgery, instead of mastectomy, with equivalent survival outcomes. Although breast-conserving surgery is a procedure with relatively low morbidity, it still affects quality of life. Approximately 30 per cent of patients who undergo breast-conserving surgery and SLN biopsy report moderate, persistent pain 2 years after surgery, and patients who have breast-conserving surgery and mastectomy report similarly lower quality of life up to 8 years after surgery 38 . \n\nIn 2017, the St Gallen International Breast Cancer Conference highlighted opportunities for de-escalation of breast cancer treatment on the basis of tumour stage and tumour biology 40 . The omission of surgery should be restricted to patients for whom no residual disease after NAT can be expected. Therefore, patients who have a high probability of a pCR, and for whom there is evidence of concordance between iCR and pCR, are appropriate candidates for trials that omit surgery.",

Optimal cytoreductive surgery is the most important prognostic factor in its management. When complete cytoreduction is anticipated to be challenging, neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy (NACT) becomes an alternative. Imaging modalities are utilized in the decision-making process for primary treatment. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic performance and accuracy of preoperative MRI, CT, and 18F-FDG PET/CT in detecting the extent of EOC. Materials and Methods: Between 2017 and 2018, 24 patients with primary (with or without neoadjuvant chemotherapy) or recurrent EOC diagnosed at the Department of Gynecologic Oncology, Istanbul University, Istanbul Faculty of Medicine, were enrolled in this study. These 24 women underwent preoperative imaging modalities within 7 days prior to surgery. The results were compared with histopathological findings, considered the gold standard. Results: We evaluated 24 anatomic regions most commonly involved in EOC. The sensitivity of MRI, CT, and PET/CT in detecting \u2265 0.5 cm implants was 95%, 84%, and 86%, respectively. However, when including implants < 0.5 cm, sensitivity decreased significantly to 40%, 38%, and 42%, respectively. The calculated area under the curve (AUC) for tumors, including those < 0.5 cm, was evaluated as weak for all three modalities (MRI: 0.689, CT: 0.678, PET/CT: 0.691), with PET/CT detecting the largest area. For detecting tumors \u2265 0.5 cm, the AUCs were 0.974, 0.921, and 0.923 for MRI, CT, and PET/CT, respectively. The largest AUC was calculated with MRI, and the AUCs for all three methods were evaluated as excellent. Accuracy was comparable among all three imaging modalities, and no statistically significant differences were found (p < 0.05). Conclusions: While imaging modalities are valuable tools for evaluating abdominal spread in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), they have demonstrated limited success in detecting miliary disease. The risk of false negatives for miliary tumors on PET/CT may be mitigated by combining it with other imaging modalities such as MRI or CT. Further investigations are necessary to identify more accurate imaging techniques for this challenging clinical scenario.",

Surface epithelial tumors are the most common type of ovarian cancer [2]. Epithelial ovarian, tubal, and peritoneal cancers have been recognized as one neoplastic entity because a lot of evidence points to a common M\u00fcllerian epithelium derivation and similar management of these three neoplasms [3,4]. \n\nEpithelial ovarian cancer generally presents at an advanced stage (75%), often due to its asymptomatic nature [5]. It remains the leading cause of gynecological cancer mortality, accounting for 43% of deaths [6]. \n\nPlatinum-based chemotherapy following primary cytoreductive surgery forms the cornerstone of epithelial ovarian cancer treatment [7]. Evidence suggests that optimal cytoreduction is the most important prognostic factor of survival [8,9]. \n\nCytoreductive surgery is more feasible in patients with early-stage disease; however, individuals with advanced-stage EOC frequently present with extensive metastatic disease. This makes primary cytoreductive surgery an aggressive procedure with potentially high perioperative morbidity and mortality. \n\nPatients with advanced-stage disease, extensive tumor burden, older age, poor performance status or medical comorbidities may benefit from neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy (NACT) [10,11]. \n\nImaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and 18-Florodeoksiglukoz positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) may provide valuable information regarding the extent of the disease, the location of peritoneal metastases, and the feasibility of complete cytoreductive surgery. This critical information aids gynecologic oncologists in determining the most appropriate therapeutic strategy [12]. \n\nAlthough CT is most commonly used to stage ovarian cancer patients, MRI and PET/CT are increasingly used in specialized centers. \n\nThis study aims to assess the sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of these imaging modalities for EOC.",

G. Kartal, Z. \u00d6zkan, S. Topuz, M. Salihoglu\n## Abstract\nBackground and Objectives: Epithelial ovarian\u2013tubal\u2013peritoneal cancer (EOC) is the most common type of ovarian cancer. Optimal cytoreductive surgery is the most important prognostic factor in its management. When complete cytoreduction is anticipated to be challenging, neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy (NACT) becomes an alternative. Imaging modalities are utilized in the decision-making process for primary treatment. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic performance and accuracy of preoperative MRI, CT, and 18F-FDG PET/CT in detecting the extent of EOC. Materials and Methods: Between 2017 and 2018, 24 patients with primary (with or without neoadjuvant chemotherapy) or recurrent EOC diagnosed at the Department of Gynecologic Oncology, Istanbul University, Istanbul Faculty of Medicine, were enrolled in this study. These 24 women underwent preoperative imaging modalities within 7 days prior to surgery. The results were compared with histopathological findings, considered the gold standard. Results: We evaluated 24 anatomic regions most commonly involved in EOC. The sensitivity of MRI, CT, and PET/CT in detecting \u2265 0.5 cm implants was 95%, 84%, and 86%, respectively. However, when including implants < 0.5 cm, sensitivity decreased significantly to 40%, 38%, and 42%, respectively. The calculated area under the curve (AUC) for tumors, including those < 0.5 cm, was evaluated as weak for all three modalities (MRI: 0.689, CT: 0.678, PET/CT: 0.691), with PET/CT detecting the largest area. For detecting tumors \u2265 0.5 cm, the AUCs were 0.974, 0.921, and 0.923 for MRI, CT, and PET/CT, respectively. The largest AUC was calculated with MRI, and the AUCs for all three methods were evaluated as excellent. Accuracy was comparable among all three imaging modalities, and no statistically significant differences were found (p < 0.05). Conclusions: While imaging modalities are valuable tools for evaluating abdominal spread in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), they have demonstrated limited success in detecting miliary disease. The risk of false negatives for miliary tumors on PET/CT may be mitigated by combining it with other imaging modalities such as MRI or CT. Further investigations are necessary to identify more accurate imaging techniques for this challenging clinical scenario.\n## Introduction\nApproximately 90% of ovarian cancers arise from the coelomic epithelium or modified mesothelium [1]. Surface epithelial tumors are the most common type of ovarian cancer [2]. Epithelial ovarian, tubal, and peritoneal cancers have been recognized as one neoplastic entity because a lot of evidence points to a common M\u00fcllerian epithelium derivation and similar management of these three neoplasms [3,4]. \n\nEpithelial ovarian cancer generally presents at an advanced stage (75%), often due to its asymptomatic nature [5]. It remains the leading cause of gynecological cancer mortality, accounting for 43% of deaths [6]. \n\nPlatinum-based chemotherapy following primary cytoreductive surgery forms the cornerstone of epithelial ovarian cancer treatment [7]. Evidence suggests that optimal cytoreduction is the most important prognostic factor of survival [8,9]. \n\nCytoreductive surgery is more feasible in patients with early-stage disease; however, individuals with advanced-stage EOC frequently present with extensive metastatic disease. This makes primary cytoreductive surgery an aggressive procedure with potentially high perioperative morbidity and mortality. \n\nPatients with advanced-stage disease, extensive tumor burden, older age, poor performance status or medical comorbidities may benefit from neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy (NACT) [10,11]. \n\nImaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and 18-Florodeoksiglukoz positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) may provide valuable information regarding the extent of the disease, the location of peritoneal metastases, and the feasibility of complete cytoreductive surgery. This critical information aids gynecologic oncologists in determining the most appropriate therapeutic strategy [12]. \n\nAlthough CT is most commonly used to stage ovarian cancer patients, MRI and PET/CT are increasingly used in specialized centers. \n\nThis study aims to assess the sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of these imaging modalities for EOC.",

            "abstract": "Advances in immunotherapy have achieved remarkable clinical outcomes in tumors with low curability, but their effects are limited, and increasing evidence has implicated tumoral and non-tumoral components of the tumor microenvironment as critical mediators of cancer progression. At the same time, the clinical successes achieved with minimally invasive and optically-guided surgery and image-guided and ablative radiation strategies have been successfully implemented in clinical care. More effective, localized and safer treatments have fueled strong research interest in radioimmunotherapy, which has shown the potential immunomodulatory effects of ionizing radiation. However, increasingly more observations suggest that immunosuppressive changes, metabolic remodeling, and angiogenic responses in the local tumor microenvironment play a central role in tumor recurrence. In this review, we address challenges to identify responders vs. non-responders to the immune checkpoint blockade, discuss recent developments in combinations of immunotherapy and radiotherapy for clinical evaluation, and consider the clinical impact of immunosuppressive changes in the tumor microenvironment in the context of surgery and radiation. Since the therapy-induced modulation of the tumor microenvironment presents a multiplicity of forms, we propose that overcoming microenvironment related resistance can become clinically relevant and represents a novel strategy to optimize treatment immunogenicity and improve patient outcome.",

                    "text": "Surgery and radiation remain strong curative modalities for treatment of established solid tumors but treatment failure continues to be a significant problem. The best established role of surgical oncology is the complete removal of the tumor, with an additional strong foundation to question the elective treatment of uninvolved regional lymph nodes in a large variety of tumor types and resection of metastatic disease which is increasingly offered to selected patients with indolent oligometastatic disease (52). Critical to all of them is securing negative surgical margins. \n\nLess invasive technologies and advances in imaging leading to minimally invasive and robot-assisted surgeries are revolutionizing surgical care (5). Likewise, advanced image guidance and motion management strategies are shaping new therapeutic radiation strategies enabling the safe administration of ablative doses of radiation (2). Advanced imaging is fundamental and uniquely placed to serve both margin negativity rates and future radiation strategies. \n\nSurgical margin positivity rate (cancer cells at the edge of tumor resection) has not significantly improved in recent decades and when it does occur prognosis is significantly affected in many tumor types. Margin positivity rates across all types of cancer range from 15 to 60% (53). A recent report on positive surgical margins in the ten most common solid cancers has identified oral cavity cancer with the highest rate with up to 25% of cases, no change over time, with significant effects on tumor relapse and overall survival. For advanced disease, the rates ranged between 20.9% (breast) and 65.5% (prostate) with related worse outcome in seven tumor types (54). Although not a true resistance type, we propose the term \"margin-missing\" effect to characterize this situation which leads to treatment failure and resistance. \n\nFluorescence-guided surgery, which allows intraoperative visualization of tumors, is an evolving image-guided surgical strategy to help differentiate tumor cells from normal surrounding tissues in real time. Near-infrared fluorescence imaging has a higher tumor to background ratio, high tissue penetration (5-10 mm), and little interference from intrinsic fluorescence. Indocyanine green is the most widely used probe in fluorescence-guided surgery although tumor detectability is not very good and optical technology is still evolving (55).",

Benavente, Almudena S\u00e1nchez-Garc\u00eda, S. Naches, M. Lleonart, J. Lorente\n## Abstract\nAdvances in immunotherapy have achieved remarkable clinical outcomes in tumors with low curability, but their effects are limited, and increasing evidence has implicated tumoral and non-tumoral components of the tumor microenvironment as critical mediators of cancer progression. At the same time, the clinical successes achieved with minimally invasive and optically-guided surgery and image-guided and ablative radiation strategies have been successfully implemented in clinical care. More effective, localized and safer treatments have fueled strong research interest in radioimmunotherapy, which has shown the potential immunomodulatory effects of ionizing radiation. However, increasingly more observations suggest that immunosuppressive changes, metabolic remodeling, and angiogenic responses in the local tumor microenvironment play a central role in tumor recurrence. In this review, we address challenges to identify responders vs. non-responders to the immune checkpoint blockade, discuss recent developments in combinations of immunotherapy and radiotherapy for clinical evaluation, and consider the clinical impact of immunosuppressive changes in the tumor microenvironment in the context of surgery and radiation. Since the therapy-induced modulation of the tumor microenvironment presents a multiplicity of forms, we propose that overcoming microenvironment related resistance can become clinically relevant and represents a novel strategy to optimize treatment immunogenicity and improve patient outcome.\n## CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS OF TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS\nSurgery and radiation remain strong curative modalities for treatment of established solid tumors but treatment failure continues to be a significant problem. The best established role of surgical oncology is the complete removal of the tumor, with an additional strong foundation to question the elective treatment of uninvolved regional lymph nodes in a large variety of tumor types and resection of metastatic disease which is increasingly offered to selected patients with indolent oligometastatic disease (52). Critical to all of them is securing negative surgical margins. \n\nLess invasive technologies and advances in imaging leading to minimally invasive and robot-assisted surgeries are revolutionizing surgical care (5). Likewise, advanced image guidance and motion management strategies are shaping new therapeutic radiation strategies enabling the safe administration of ablative doses of radiation (2). Advanced imaging is fundamental and uniquely placed to serve both margin negativity rates and future radiation strategies. \n\nSurgical margin positivity rate (cancer cells at the edge of tumor resection) has not significantly improved in recent decades and when it does occur prognosis is significantly affected in many tumor types. Margin positivity rates across all types of cancer range from 15 to 60% (53). A recent report on positive surgical margins in the ten most common solid cancers has identified oral cavity cancer with the highest rate with up to 25% of cases, no change over time, with significant effects on tumor relapse and overall survival. For advanced disease, the rates ranged between 20.9% (breast) and 65.5% (prostate) with related worse outcome in seven tumor types (54). Although not a true resistance type, we propose the term \"margin-missing\" effect to characterize this situation which leads to treatment failure and resistance. \n\nFluorescence-guided surgery, which allows intraoperative visualization of tumors, is an evolving image-guided surgical strategy to help differentiate tumor cells from normal surrounding tissues in real time. Near-infrared fluorescence imaging has a higher tumor to background ratio, high tissue penetration (5-10 mm), and little interference from intrinsic fluorescence. Indocyanine green is the most widely used probe in fluorescence-guided surgery although tumor detectability is not very good and optical technology is still evolving (55).",

                    "text": "Over the past few decades, the literature has demonstrated a growing interest in reirradiation cases [24,25]. Due to factors such as accumulated prior dose and anatomical changes, these cases require more complex planning. In the presented case, the patient's distinctive anatomical circumstances, arising from prior surgeries and radiation treatment, necessitated a tailored therapeutic strategy. Consequently, the utilization of ultra-hypofractionated CK therapy alongside androgen deprivation therapy was deemed to be the optimal approach. After a thorough assessment of the patient's medical history and considering the time that elapsed since the previous rectal cancer treatment, the treatment team ascertained that the current dosage and approach hold promising curative potential for management of the localized PCa. \n\nThe CK system has demonstrated a wide range of application for treating primary or recurrent tumors, as well as small metastatic lesions, providing excellent local control and minimal toxicity, even in cases of previous surgery or radiotherapy [26]. The system utilizes integrated digital X-ray imaging, enabling the use of bone landmarks or gold fiducial markers, which are used to set up the patient and track the position of the target volume throughout the entire treatment course. \n\nRadio-opaque markers could be inserted using different approaches. In general, imageguided procedures such as percutaneous biopsies, ablations or marker placements rely heavily on the accuracy of imaging visualization. Ultrasound (US) is commonly used to guide interventions in the abdomen, mainly due to its real-time capabilities and its ability to select non-axial approaches. However, finding an adequate acoustic window might not always be easy. CT provides a broader field of view and is not limited by the presence of air or bones, but requires an axial or near-axial approach and lacks real-time capabilities. Technological advancements now allow for the real-time fusion of US and CT images, enhancing the guidance of percutaneous procedures and overcoming the limitations of each individual imaging modality [27,28]. \n\nIn addition, the application of an EMN facilitates virtual navigation within a preacquired imaging dataset right within the interventional room, thereby enabling unconventional approaches.",

Due to factors such as accumulated prior dose and anatomical changes, these cases require more complex planning. In the presented case, the patient's distinctive anatomical circumstances, arising from prior surgeries and radiation treatment, necessitated a tailored therapeutic strategy. Consequently, the utilization of ultra-hypofractionated CK therapy alongside androgen deprivation therapy was deemed to be the optimal approach. After a thorough assessment of the patient's medical history and considering the time that elapsed since the previous rectal cancer treatment, the treatment team ascertained that the current dosage and approach hold promising curative potential for management of the localized PCa. \n\nThe CK system has demonstrated a wide range of application for treating primary or recurrent tumors, as well as small metastatic lesions, providing excellent local control and minimal toxicity, even in cases of previous surgery or radiotherapy [26]. The system utilizes integrated digital X-ray imaging, enabling the use of bone landmarks or gold fiducial markers, which are used to set up the patient and track the position of the target volume throughout the entire treatment course. \n\nRadio-opaque markers could be inserted using different approaches. In general, imageguided procedures such as percutaneous biopsies, ablations or marker placements rely heavily on the accuracy of imaging visualization. Ultrasound (US) is commonly used to guide interventions in the abdomen, mainly due to its real-time capabilities and its ability to select non-axial approaches. However, finding an adequate acoustic window might not always be easy. CT provides a broader field of view and is not limited by the presence of air or bones, but requires an axial or near-axial approach and lacks real-time capabilities. Technological advancements now allow for the real-time fusion of US and CT images, enhancing the guidance of percutaneous procedures and overcoming the limitations of each individual imaging modality [27,28]. \n\nIn addition, the application of an EMN facilitates virtual navigation within a preacquired imaging dataset right within the interventional room, thereby enabling unconventional approaches.",

There is a finite rate of ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence (IBTR) for breast conserving therapy (BCT) with annual rates of less than 1% for specialist breast practices. There has been recent consensus on the definition of an adequate resection margin for both invasive and noninvasive breast cancer treated with BCS, although some variation in margin policy persists with definitions of \u2018no tumour at ink\u2019, 1 and 2 mm margin mandates. Despite the development of methods for intraoperative assessment of margins, up to 20% of patients require further surgery (cavity re-excision or completion mastectomy) to achieve clear surgical margins. In the past decade, several novel technologies for intraoperative margin assessment have been explored with the aim of reducing rates of re-operation and its attendant patient anxiety, inconvenience and additional cost. Ongoing studies are addressing the safety, feasibility and cost-effectiveness of these novel technologies relative to methods in routine clinical usage.\n## Intraoperative specimen imaging\nAnother intraoperative imaging modality for reducing rates of margin positivity at initial surgery is IOUS, which can be performed by surgeons who are increasingly ultrasound competent.

Preoperative staging with endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed very discordant results. EUS showed a tumour present in the mucosa with no submucosal invasion, while MRI revealed invasion of the muscularis propria consistent with an invasive stage T2 carcinoma. Based on the MRI findings, the patient underwent a low anterior resection of the tumour. The surgical pathology specimen revealed a villous adenoma with lowgrade dysplasia but no carcinoma and no extension into the muscularis propria. The present case highlights the uncertainty that currently exists as to which imaging modality provides the greatest accuracy in the staging of rectal cancer and in guiding the type of surgical procedure performed. Two recent meta-analyses and a systematic review of the literature point to EUS as the imaging modality of choice for determining muscularis propria and perirectal tissue invasion, as well as nodal involvement.",

                    "text": "Rectal cancer is the third most common malignancy in the western world, and is the second most common cause of cancer deaths (1,2). Surgical excision is the primary treatment modality and because local recurrence after resection is associated with a poor prognosis, much attention has been focused on determining the best diagnostic and treatment strategies to optimize local control of the primary tumour (3). \n\nSurgical excision of rectal cancer consists of either transanal local excision, endoscopic microsurgery or total mesorectal excision. The stage of the tumour, based on the tumour, node, metastasis classification system (Table 1), impacts heavily on prognosis and determines the type of surgical procedure performed (4,5). Transanal local excision or endoscopic microsurgery are considered for cancers staged at T1 or lower, while total mesorectal excision would be reserved for stages T2 and T3. Thus, accurate preoperative staging of rectal tumours is paramount in guiding the type of surgical procedure performed. \n\nComputed tomography (CT), MRI and EUS have all been used to stage rectal tumours; however, controversy exists as to which diagnostic imaging modality provides the most accurate information. The diagnostic accuracy of these imaging techniques for assessing the depth of tumour invasion, spread to the mesorectal fascia and lymph node involvement has been compared extensively. The findings of the largest and most recent trials are discussed in the present article and are summarized in Table 2. \n\nA recent meta-analysis (6) found that EUS, when compared with MRI, overstaged muscularis propria invasion in T1 cancers, while CT and MRI each significantly understaged perirectal tissue invasion for tumours staged at T3 or greater. A second meta-analysis (7) found that EUS was also more effective at identifying nodal status than MRI and CT, although the finding was not statistically significant. Furthermore, only MRI was able to predict circumferential resection margins with accuracy. \n\nFindings from other studies have contradicted these results.",

Buresi, I. Zandieh, A. Nagy, A. Spielmann, W. Yee, A. Weiss, E. Yoshida\n## Abstract\nA case of a 60-year-old man with recurrent rectal villous adenoma is described. Preoperative staging with endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed very discordant results. EUS showed a tumour present in the mucosa with no submucosal invasion, while MRI revealed invasion of the muscularis propria consistent with an invasive stage T2 carcinoma. Based on the MRI findings, the patient underwent a low anterior resection of the tumour. The surgical pathology specimen revealed a villous adenoma with lowgrade dysplasia but no carcinoma and no extension into the muscularis propria. The present case highlights the uncertainty that currently exists as to which imaging modality provides the greatest accuracy in the staging of rectal cancer and in guiding the type of surgical procedure performed. Two recent meta-analyses and a systematic review of the literature point to EUS as the imaging modality of choice for determining muscularis propria and perirectal tissue invasion, as well as nodal involvement.\n## DisCUssion\nRectal cancer is the third most common malignancy in the western world, and is the second most common cause of cancer deaths (1,2). Surgical excision is the primary treatment modality and because local recurrence after resection is associated with a poor prognosis, much attention has been focused on determining the best diagnostic and treatment strategies to optimize local control of the primary tumour (3). \n\nSurgical excision of rectal cancer consists of either transanal local excision, endoscopic microsurgery or total mesorectal excision. The stage of the tumour, based on the tumour, node, metastasis classification system (Table 1), impacts heavily on prognosis and determines the type of surgical procedure performed (4,5). Transanal local excision or endoscopic microsurgery are considered for cancers staged at T1 or lower, while total mesorectal excision would be reserved for stages T2 and T3. Thus, accurate preoperative staging of rectal tumours is paramount in guiding the type of surgical procedure performed. \n\nComputed tomography (CT), MRI and EUS have all been used to stage rectal tumours; however, controversy exists as to which diagnostic imaging modality provides the most accurate information. The diagnostic accuracy of these imaging techniques for assessing the depth of tumour invasion, spread to the mesorectal fascia and lymph node involvement has been compared extensively. The findings of the largest and most recent trials are discussed in the present article and are summarized in Table 2. \n\nA recent meta-analysis (6) found that EUS, when compared with MRI, overstaged muscularis propria invasion in T1 cancers, while CT and MRI each significantly understaged perirectal tissue invasion for tumours staged at T3 or greater. A second meta-analysis (7) found that EUS was also more effective at identifying nodal status than MRI and CT, although the finding was not statistically significant. Furthermore, only MRI was able to predict circumferential resection margins with accuracy. \n\nFindings from other studies have contradicted these results.",

To that end, the surgeon should detect the tumor, remove it and validate that there are no residual cancer cells left behind. Residual cells at the incision margin of the tissue removed during surgery are associated with tumor recurrence and poor prognosis for the patient. In order to remove the tumor tissue completely with minimal collateral damage to healthy tissue, there is a need for diagnostic tools that will differentiate between the tumor and its normal surroundings. Methods: We designed, synthesized and characterized three novel polymeric Turn-ON probes that will be activated at the tumor site by cysteine cathepsins that are highly expressed in multiple tumor types. Utilizing orthotopic breast cancer and melanoma models, which spontaneously metastasize to the brain, we studied the kinetics of our polymeric Turn-ON nano-probes. Results: To date, numerous low molecular weight cathepsin-sensitive substrates have been reported, however, most of them suffer from rapid clearance and reduced signal shortly after administration. Here, we show an improved tumor-to-background ratio upon activation of our Turn-ON probes by cathepsins. The signal obtained from the tumor was stable and delineated the tumor boundaries during the whole surgical procedure, enabling accurate resection. Conclusions: Our findings show that the control groups of tumor-bearing mice, which underwent either standard surgery under white light only or under the fluorescence guidance of the commercially-available imaging agents ProSense\u00ae 680 or 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA), survived for less time and suffered from tumor recurrence earlier than the group that underwent image-guided surgery (IGS) using our Turn-ON probes. Our \"smart\" polymeric probes can potentially assist surgeons' decision in real-time during surgery regarding the tumor margins needed to be removed, leading to improved patient outcome.",

If cancer cells are detected in the surrounding tissue excised during surgery, it is considered a \"positive tumor margin\", which is associated with poor prognosis, higher rates of recurrence and lower survival rates in various cancer types [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8]. Maneuvering between the two edges of damaging healthy tissues [9] and leaving residual disease is the main challenge during tumor resection that could certainly benefit from relying on more than the surgeon's naked eye. Image-guided surgery (IGS) has recently emerged as a complementary imaging technique to white light, supplying the surgeon an essential tool for the important goals mentioned above. The area of IGS has evolved rapidly during the last two decades, as reflected by the various imaging agents for different modalities, such as diffuse tensor imaging (DTI) and functional MRI (fMRI), that function as diagnostics before surgery to locate the tumor in relation to functional regions, and during surgery in order to assess the tumor margins [10][11][12][13][14][15]. However, these modalities lack the possibility of using targeted contrast agents to specifically visualize certain enzymes that are highly active at the tumor site, thus enabling better differentiation of cancerous from healthy tissue. In addition, intraoperative systems are costly and complex [16]. \n\nIntraoperative fluorescence imaging offers the benefits of high contrast and sensitivity, low cost, ease of use, safety, and visualization of cells and tissues both in vitro and in vivo [17,18]. Over the past several years, a vast amount of published data showed improved visualization of cancer tissue over dark background by the utilization of different fluorescent probes. One example of a clinically evaluated fluorescent \"Always ON\" low molecular weight (MW) probe includes a folate receptor-targeted fluorophore [19]. The current challenge of nearinfrared fluorescence (NIRF)-guided surgery is to design probes with high selectivity for tumors and clear visualization. To that end, different fluorescent probes have been developed and studied; these are often referred to as \"smart\" probes.",

To that end, the surgeon should detect the tumor, remove it and validate that there are no residual cancer cells left behind. Residual cells at the incision margin of the tissue removed during surgery are associated with tumor recurrence and poor prognosis for the patient. In order to remove the tumor tissue completely with minimal collateral damage to healthy tissue, there is a need for diagnostic tools that will differentiate between the tumor and its normal surroundings. Methods: We designed, synthesized and characterized three novel polymeric Turn-ON probes that will be activated at the tumor site by cysteine cathepsins that are highly expressed in multiple tumor types. Utilizing orthotopic breast cancer and melanoma models, which spontaneously metastasize to the brain, we studied the kinetics of our polymeric Turn-ON nano-probes. Results: To date, numerous low molecular weight cathepsin-sensitive substrates have been reported, however, most of them suffer from rapid clearance and reduced signal shortly after administration. Here, we show an improved tumor-to-background ratio upon activation of our Turn-ON probes by cathepsins. The signal obtained from the tumor was stable and delineated the tumor boundaries during the whole surgical procedure, enabling accurate resection. Conclusions: Our findings show that the control groups of tumor-bearing mice, which underwent either standard surgery under white light only or under the fluorescence guidance of the commercially-available imaging agents ProSense\u00ae 680 or 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA), survived for less time and suffered from tumor recurrence earlier than the group that underwent image-guided surgery (IGS) using our Turn-ON probes. Our \"smart\" polymeric probes can potentially assist surgeons' decision in real-time during surgery regarding the tumor margins needed to be removed, leading to improved patient outcome.\n## Ivyspring\nInternational Publisher improving patient outcome. If cancer cells are detected in the surrounding tissue excised during surgery, it is considered a \"positive tumor margin\", which is associated with poor prognosis, higher rates of recurrence and lower survival rates in various cancer types [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8]. Maneuvering between the two edges of damaging healthy tissues [9] and leaving residual disease is the main challenge during tumor resection that could certainly benefit from relying on more than the surgeon's naked eye. Image-guided surgery (IGS) has recently emerged as a complementary imaging technique to white light, supplying the surgeon an essential tool for the important goals mentioned above. The area of IGS has evolved rapidly during the last two decades, as reflected by the various imaging agents for different modalities, such as diffuse tensor imaging (DTI) and functional MRI (fMRI), that function as diagnostics before surgery to locate the tumor in relation to functional regions, and during surgery in order to assess the tumor margins [10][11][12][13][14][15]. However, these modalities lack the possibility of using targeted contrast agents to specifically visualize certain enzymes that are highly active at the tumor site, thus enabling better differentiation of cancerous from healthy tissue. In addition, intraoperative systems are costly and complex [16]. \n\nIntraoperative fluorescence imaging offers the benefits of high contrast and sensitivity, low cost, ease of use, safety, and visualization of cells and tissues both in vitro and in vivo [17,18]. Over the past several years, a vast amount of published data showed improved visualization of cancer tissue over dark background by the utilization of different fluorescent probes. One example of a clinically evaluated fluorescent \"Always ON\" low molecular weight (MW) probe includes a folate receptor-targeted fluorophore [19]. The current challenge of nearinfrared fluorescence (NIRF)-guided surgery is to design probes with high selectivity for tumors and clear visualization. To that end, different fluorescent probes have been developed and studied; these are often referred to as \"smart\" probes.",

The recurrence rate for advanced laryngeal cancer is between 25 and 50%. In order to improve surgical resection of laryngeal cancer and reduce local recurrence rates, various intraoperative optical imaging techniques have been investigated. In this systematic review we identify these technologies, evaluating the current state and future directions of optical imaging for this indication. Evidently, the investigated imaging modalities are generally unsuitable for deep margin assessment, and, therefore, inadequate to guide resection in advanced laryngeal disease. We discuss two optical imaging techniques that can overcome these limitations and suggest how they can be used to achieve adequate margins in laryngeal cancer at all stages. Abstract Laryngeal cancer is a prevalent head and neck malignancy, with poor prognosis and low survival rates for patients with advanced disease. Treatment consists of unimodal therapy through surgery or radiotherapy in early staged tumors, while advanced stage tumors are generally treated with multimodal chemoradiotherapy or (total) laryngectomy followed by radiotherapy. Still, the recurrence rate for advanced laryngeal cancer is between 25 and 50%. In order to improve surgical resection of laryngeal cancer and reduce local recurrence rates, various intraoperative optical imaging techniques have been investigated. In this systematic review, we identify these technologies, evaluating the current state and future directions of optical imaging for this indication.

Materials and methods RANDO phantom was used with and without the breast attachment in order to represent the patients after breast conserving surgery (BCS) and those received modified radical mastectomy (MRM). The prescription dose is 40.05 Gy in fifteen fractions for whole breast irradiation (WBI) or 20 Gy single shot for partial breast irradiation (PBI). Thirteen different portals of intensity-modulated radiation therapy were created. And then we evaluated dose distribution in five areas (on the skin of the tip of the nose, the chin, the neck, the abdomen and the thyroid.) outside of the irradiated field with and without 0.35 Tesla. In addition, we added a piece of bolus with the thickness of 1cm on the skin in order to compare the ESE difference with and without a bolus. Lastly, we loaded two patients\u2019 images for PBI comparison. Results We found that 0.35 Tesla caused redundant doses to the skin of the chin and the neck as high as 9.79% and 5.59% of the prescription dose in the BCS RANDO model, respectively. For RANDO phantom without the breast accessory (simulating MRM), the maximal dose increase were 8.71% and 4.67% of the prescription dose to the skin of the chin and the neck, respectively. Furthermore, the bolus we added efficiently decrease the unnecessary dose caused by ESE up to 59.8%. Conclusion We report the first physical investigation on successful avoidance of superfluous doses on a 0.35T MR-Linac for breast cancer patients. Future studies of MRgRT on the individual body shape and its association with ESE influence is warranted.",

                    "text": "Breast cancer has replaced lung cancer as the most frequently diagnosed cancer globally in the latest report by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (1). An estimated 685,000 women died from breast cancer in 2020, corresponding to 1 in every 6 cancer deaths in women (2). Breast cancer patients nowadays often are treated by breast-conserving surgery (BCS) followed by radiation therapy (RT). RT after BCS is indicated for ductal carcinoma in situ (stage 0), since RT greatly lowers the risk of local recurrence (3). In early (stage I-II) invasive breast cancer, adjuvant RT followed by BCS remains a standard of care (4). Based upon high level evidence for those with stage III-IV, RT is essential for selected patients after neoadjuvant systemic treatment followed by BCS or modified radical mastectomy (MRM) (4). Since RT may be recommended for all stages, the implications of different modalities of image guided radiotherapy (IGRT) are the keys to precision treatment for patients with breast cancer after BCS or MRM as well as for those with recurrence or distant metastasis (5). \n\nThe advance of both modern on-board imaging and planning software are required for adaptive treatment planning which had long been proposed (6). It has been challenging that thoracic radiotherapy such as that for breast irradiation has large inter-fractional and intrafractional organ movement variation causing unwanted radiationinduced complications such as cardiac and pulmonary toxicities. Some used mechanical ventilation and surface-image mapping system to reduce the within-patient variability of breathing for breast cancer patients (7). A mounting body of evidence strongly supports IGRT (8)(9)(10)(11)(12)(13)(14)(15)(16)(17). Until recently, image guidance was only performed prior to radiation treatment without simultaneous tracking. Magnetic resonance imaging-guided radiotherapy (MRgRT) has lately emerged as the state-of-the-art science in precision RT. It enables Radiation Oncologists to actually see the targets in relation to surrounding normal tissue during treatment (18,19).",

Lu, Cheng-Han Chiang, Ming-Yi Huang, Chih\u2010Jen Huang\n## Abstract\nPurpose This research aimed to analyze electron stream effect (ESE) during magnetic resonance image guided radiotherapy (MRgRT) for breast cancer patients on a MR-Linac (0.35 Tesla, 6MV), with a focus on the prevention of redundant radiation exposure. Materials and methods RANDO phantom was used with and without the breast attachment in order to represent the patients after breast conserving surgery (BCS) and those received modified radical mastectomy (MRM). The prescription dose is 40.05 Gy in fifteen fractions for whole breast irradiation (WBI) or 20 Gy single shot for partial breast irradiation (PBI). Thirteen different portals of intensity-modulated radiation therapy were created. And then we evaluated dose distribution in five areas (on the skin of the tip of the nose, the chin, the neck, the abdomen and the thyroid.) outside of the irradiated field with and without 0.35 Tesla. In addition, we added a piece of bolus with the thickness of 1cm on the skin in order to compare the ESE difference with and without a bolus. Lastly, we loaded two patients\u2019 images for PBI comparison. Results We found that 0.35 Tesla caused redundant doses to the skin of the chin and the neck as high as 9.79% and 5.59% of the prescription dose in the BCS RANDO model, respectively. For RANDO phantom without the breast accessory (simulating MRM), the maximal dose increase were 8.71% and 4.67% of the prescription dose to the skin of the chin and the neck, respectively. Furthermore, the bolus we added efficiently decrease the unnecessary dose caused by ESE up to 59.8%. Conclusion We report the first physical investigation on successful avoidance of superfluous doses on a 0.35T MR-Linac for breast cancer patients. Future studies of MRgRT on the individual body shape and its association with ESE influence is warranted.\n## Introduction\nBreast cancer has replaced lung cancer as the most frequently diagnosed cancer globally in the latest report by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (1). An estimated 685,000 women died from breast cancer in 2020, corresponding to 1 in every 6 cancer deaths in women (2). Breast cancer patients nowadays often are treated by breast-conserving surgery (BCS) followed by radiation therapy (RT). RT after BCS is indicated for ductal carcinoma in situ (stage 0), since RT greatly lowers the risk of local recurrence (3). In early (stage I-II) invasive breast cancer, adjuvant RT followed by BCS remains a standard of care (4). Based upon high level evidence for those with stage III-IV, RT is essential for selected patients after neoadjuvant systemic treatment followed by BCS or modified radical mastectomy (MRM) (4). Since RT may be recommended for all stages, the implications of different modalities of image guided radiotherapy (IGRT) are the keys to precision treatment for patients with breast cancer after BCS or MRM as well as for those with recurrence or distant metastasis (5). \n\nThe advance of both modern on-board imaging and planning software are required for adaptive treatment planning which had long been proposed (6). It has been challenging that thoracic radiotherapy such as that for breast irradiation has large inter-fractional and intrafractional organ movement variation causing unwanted radiationinduced complications such as cardiac and pulmonary toxicities. Some used mechanical ventilation and surface-image mapping system to reduce the within-patient variability of breathing for breast cancer patients (7). A mounting body of evidence strongly supports IGRT (8)(9)(10)(11)(12)(13)(14)(15)(16)(17). Until recently, image guidance was only performed prior to radiation treatment without simultaneous tracking. Magnetic resonance imaging-guided radiotherapy (MRgRT) has lately emerged as the state-of-the-art science in precision RT. It enables Radiation Oncologists to actually see the targets in relation to surrounding normal tissue during treatment (18,19).",

            "text": "Surgery has long been a cornerstone of cancer treatment in many types of cancer. Traditionally, intraoperative assessment of the resection margin is largely dependent on visual inspection and palpation of tumors, with the aid of frozen section analysis. Although preoperative imaging can provide gross anatomical information, in situ translation of these images to the operation field is challenging. With the advancement of molecular imaging technology and its clinical application, the gap between preoperative radiologic images and surgical findings has been reduced through image-guided surgery. However, the imaging probes for intraoperative visualization of tumors are not individual tumor-specific. As conventional oncology has moved toward precision oncology with genomic and biological information specific to each tumor, image-guided surgery should also shift toward tumor biology-based image-guided surgery, so-called precision surgery for cancer. In precision cancer surgery, tumors should be analyzed molecularly and genetically to select the optimal imaging probes for individual tumors before surgical resection, beyond the use of predetermined imaging probes for certain types of cancer. This will raise the likelihood of meeting the surgical goals of cancer treatment. In summary, precision cancer surgery can be defined as individual tumor biology-based image-guided surgery.",

            "text": "To better clarify the optimal management of locally advanced tumors where the current standard of care for rectal cancer includes trimodality therapy, patients were filtered to only include clinical stage II and III disease (excluding cT4) which resulted in 1053 patients. Among these patients, the majority either received chemotherapy and radiation (n = 706, 67%) or chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery (n = 177, 16.8%). Less common combined modalities utilized were chemotherapy and surgery (n = 13, 1.2%) and radiation and surgery (n = 10, 0.9%). To compare the two most common modalities, other regimens were excluded from the final subcohort B survival analysis (Figure 1), resulting in 883 patients with complete evaluable treatment information (Table 3). On univariate analysis of subcohort B, younger age, female gender, lower Charlson-Deyo score, lower cT category, and trimodality therapy (versus chemotherapy and radiation) were associated with improved overall survival (P < 0.05 for each). On multivariate analysis, older age (HR = 1.019 per year, P = 0.001), higher Charlson/Deyo scores (P < 0.05), and lower median income of zip (P = 0.001) were associated with worse survival. Of note, therapy type, comparing chemotherapy, and radiation to trimodality therapy (chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery) showed no significant difference in survival (P = 0.909 on multivariate analysis). Figure 3 shows the unadjusted Kaplan-Meier curve for subcohort B, separated by therapy type. The Kaplan-Meier estimated 5and 10-year survival for entire cohort B is 63.8% and 50.3% (log rank P = 0.936 between receipt of chemotherapy and radiation \u00b1 surgery).",

            "text": "Precise medical diagnosis and treatment will approved the ability of surgeons to treat cancer. Intraoperative image-guided cancer surgery using FMI technology may provide the most valuable goal for addressing diseased and abnormal tissues in surgical practice. White-light reflectance supplies insufficient visual information between the tumor and normal tissue, whereas fluorescence can provide additional information to potentially prevent cancer persistence or recurrence, and unacceptable morbidity. Although FMI technology has been of substantial benefit to patient outcomes, much more work is necessary for clinical translation of the rapidly expanding number of targeted agents and imaging systems currently in the research pipeline. \n\nIntraoperative FMI has good performance in clinical applications, and many patients benefit from this method. As penetration depth is a challenge in optical imaging, intraoperative multimodal data fusion (such as adding rescanned CT and/or ultrasonography) provides possible solutions [45,178,179]. These techniques will augment the tools for accurate preoperative diagnosis, such as radiography, CT, MRI, and PET, which will provide important aid in advancing intraoperative FMI detection. Some preclinical results using the NIR imaging technique combined with other imaging methods such as ultrasonography [45], MRI [180] and X-ray CT [178] compensate for the depth issues and have already demonstrated the possibility of using the FMI guided multi-modality method to precisely excise tumors. Zhang et al. declared that tumor metastatic lymph nodes and reactive lymph nodes located in deep-seated area were distinguished with diffusion-weighted and super-paramagnetic iron oxide enhanced MR imaging [181]. Visualization of tumor draining SLNs at distant depths using NIR, MR and PET triple-modal imaging methods was done in a 4T1 tumor metastasis model and provided helpful guidance for SLN mapping and tumor metastasis diagnosis thereby revealing its potential clinical utility [182]. With breakthroughs in computer-aided treatment technology, multi-modality image registration with optical imaging methods has achieved clinical use in intraoperative applications. Through the development of intraoperative image-guided agents and imaging systems in cancer surgery, FMI technology will extend other modality imaging methods into the clinic empowering surgeons to improve patient outcomes.",

            "text": "Rectal cancer is mainly treated by surgical resection, often complemented with pre-and/or postoperative (chemo) radiotherapy in stage II-IV tumors [1][2][3], showing a 5-year survival rate of ~ 45% for stage III and ~ 20% for stage IV tumors [4]. Surgical resection of both locally advanced (LARC) and locally recurrent rectal cancer (LRRC) requires special consideration because (1) the disruption of normal anatomical planes and (2) radiotherapy-induced fibrosis can lead to a higher risk of a tumor positive involved circumferential resection margin [1,5]. In this setting, LARC was defined as T3 or T4 tumors extending close to (< 2 mm) or invading the mesorectal fascia, as shown on rectal magnetic resonance imaging. LRRC was defined as rectal cancer that recurred in the pelvic area after earlier treatment. In 10-15% of rectal cancer patients, positive surgical margins are found [6,7] which negatively affects the prognosis [8][9][10]. Local recurrence can cause debilitating symptoms, and often requires additional treatment, such as chemoradiotherapy and radiotherapy. Optimizing surgical practice and decreasing the risk of positive resection margins is therefore of great clinical and financial importance. \n\nMultiple technologies have emerged to improve the quality of surgery and surgical outcomes [11]. The Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI-AVL) has developed an image-guided navigation system to improve tumor localization during the operative procedure and prevent damage to surrounding vital structures [12]. Recently, this navigation system has been evaluated in the first series of LARC and LRRC patients, showing substantially improved negative surgical margin rates compared to standard surgery in a historical control group [12]. Since the use of a navigation system is associated with extra costs (e.g. due to extra imaging, the navigation system, and personnel), and hospital budgets are limited, new surgical technologies have to prove themselves in terms of cost-effectiveness to have a chance of reimbursement.",

            "text": "Rectal cancer is mainly treated by surgical resection, often complemented with pre-and/or postoperative (chemo) radiotherapy in stage II-IV tumors [1][2][3], showing a 5-year survival rate of ~ 45% for stage III and ~ 20% for stage IV tumors [4]. Surgical resection of both locally advanced (LARC) and locally recurrent rectal cancer (LRRC) requires special consideration because (1) the disruption of normal anatomical planes and (2) radiotherapy-induced fibrosis can lead to a higher risk of a tumor positive involved circumferential resection margin [1,5]. In this setting, LARC was defined as T3 or T4 tumors extending close to (< 2 mm) or invading the mesorectal fascia, as shown on rectal magnetic resonance imaging. LRRC was defined as rectal cancer that recurred in the pelvic area after earlier treatment. In 10-15% of rectal cancer patients, positive surgical margins are found [6,7] which negatively affects the prognosis [8][9][10]. Local recurrence can cause debilitating symptoms, and often requires additional treatment, such as chemoradiotherapy and radiotherapy. Optimizing surgical practice and decreasing the risk of positive resection margins is therefore of great clinical and financial importance. \n\nMultiple technologies have emerged to improve the quality of surgery and surgical outcomes [11]. The Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI-AVL) has developed an image-guided navigation system to improve tumor localization during the operative procedure and prevent damage to surrounding vital structures [12]. Recently, this navigation system has been evaluated in the first series of LARC and LRRC patients, showing substantially improved negative surgical margin rates compared to standard surgery in a historical control group [12]. Since the use of a navigation system is associated with extra costs (e.g. due to extra imaging, the navigation system, and personnel), and hospital budgets are limited, new surgical technologies have to prove themselves in terms of cost-effectiveness to have a chance of reimbursement.",

The survival curves according to treatment patterns for patients with clinical stage II disease are shown in Figure 2. The 3-year survival rates were 25.18% for definitive chemoradiation, 51.75% for preoperative CRT followed by surgery, 40.48% for surgery plus adjuvant therapy, 54.51% for surgery alone, and 11.23% for other treatment types (P < 0.001). \n\nFor patients with stage III disease, the most common treatment modality was definitive CRT (n \u00bc 2174) followed by preoperative CRT plus surgery (n \u00bc 957), surgery with adjuvant therapy (n \u00bc 291), and surgery alone (n \u00bc 179) (Table 2). The survival curves according to the treatment patterns are shown in Figure 3. Patients receiving preoperative CRT followed by surgery had significantly better 3-year survival rates than patients who received any of the other treatment patterns P < 0.001). \n\nSignificant variables in the univariate analyses (age, sex, surgical margin status, tumor location, histological grade, clinical T classification, clinical N classification, and treatment patterns, Table 2) were included in a multiple logisticregression model to identify the most important factors associated with survival for each clinical stage (Table 3). Cox proportional-hazards analysis was then used to determine the relative contribution of the variables to overall survival. The hazard ratio was defined as 1 in patients who received definitive CRT. There was no survival risk difference among definitive CRT, preoperative CRT followed by surgery, and surgery with adjuvant therapy for patients with clinical stages I, II, and III. However, patients receiving alternative therapies had worse survival outcomes regardless of clinical stage.",

            "text": "Two other small retrospective series showed comparable outcomes for both of these treatment modalities [22,23]. Thus, data from these retrospective series have not shown any difference between CRT and surgery in survival outcomes. \n\nThe impact of treatment modalities on loco-regional control (LRC) was addressed in a few retrospective studies. Valmasoni et al. showed that the proportion of local recurrences was significantly higher in patients treated with CRT (50% for the surgery group, 84% for the CRT group, and 50% for the combined modality group) (p = 0.024) [24]. This may be attributable to a higher number of patients with advanced-stage disease receiving CRT (stage III, IV: 75% in CRT; 58.93% in surgery; 82.5% in the trimodality group) and a relatively lower mean RT dose (50.44 \u00b1 10.53 Gy) was prescribed [24]. However, the remaining studies addressing LRC rates have shown comparable outcomes [21,22]. These studies had a uniform stage distribution in both the primary surgery and CRT arms, with a relatively higher RT dose of 60-64 Gy used [21,22]. \n\nFew series have further analysed the role of intensification of treatment with a trimodality approach comprising surgery in combination with CRT.

            "text": "Despite many advances, cancer continues to represent a significant health burden in the United States and the rest of the world. The American Cancer Society estimates that in 2018, approximately 1.7 million new diagnoses of cancer and about 609,640 cancer-related deaths are anticipated in the United States. Worldwide, cancer accounts for about 1 in 7 of all deaths. Given the far-reaching impact of cancer, affordable and remotely utilizable imaging technologies are needed to improve diagnostic accuracy, treatment efficacy, and the value of post-treatment surveillance in cancer care [1].\n\nThe three primary therapeutic modalities for cancer treatments are surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. Individually or in combination, these treatment modalities have provided and continue to provide curative or palliative care to the myriad victims of cancer. Of the three, it is radiation therapy which is most heavily dependent upon imaging technologies, often on a daily basis, if image-guided radiotherapy is used. Today, the primary modality through which any type of conventional photon radiation therapy is planned is based upon a computed tomography (CT) scan of the patient in the treatment positionbroadly referred to as CT-based treatment planning. The prescribing, recording, and reporting of photon radiation treatments is governed by the recommendations in ICRU 50 and ICRU 62, two reports generated by the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements and used virtually worldwide (ICRU, 1978(ICRU, , 1991 [2,3]. In radiation treatment planning, it is generally accepted that there are two major categories of tissuesthe tissues which are to be specifically treated and the tissues to be avoided (also called the organs at risk or OARs). Hence, the precision with which we are able to avoid or minimize the dose to the OARs and maximize dose to the targeted tissues depends upon the accuracy with which the tissues which are to be treated and the OARs are defined upon each slice of the CT scan by the treating radiation oncologist and the skill of the dosimetrist in subsequently generating a treatment plan that is highly \"conformal\"meaning that the treatment volume is well enclosed by the prescribed dose and the surrounding tissues are maximally spared [4].\n\nAlthough CT remains the primary treatment planning modality, we have over the past several years, moved beyond solely using the CT scan",

Objective\u2003To evaluate the oncological outcome of different treatment modalities for stage III laryngeal cancer using a population database. Methods\u2003A population database representing patients treated in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, was analyzed. Demographic, clinical and treatment variables were included, and the outcomes of interest were disease-specific and overall survival. Propensity score with nearest neighbor matching was used to compensate for imbalances in treatment groups. Results\u2003We retrieved data from 1,804 patients. In multivariate analysis, age, female gender, payment source, clinical N stage (cN) stages, and treatment modality were significant for disease-specific and overall survival. Patients submitted to surgery treatment had a significantly better disease-specific (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and overall survival (p\u2009<\u20090.001) compared with chemoradiation. Propensity score matching was based on cN stage, gender, age, topography, and payment modality, and allowed the pairing of 685 patients from each treatment modality. There was a significant difference in disease-specific survival favoring surgery-based treatment (p\u2009=\u20090.017). Conclusion\u2003The treatment choice has a significant impact on survival in patients with stage III laryngeal cancer with surgery-based treatment being superior to chemoradiotherapy (CRT).",

            "text": "Surgery is a major pillar for clinical management of cancer. About 80% of 15.2 million newlydiagnosed cancer patients in 2015 require surgery across the globe and by 2030 this figure will increase to 45 million [39]. Besides preventive, diagnostic, and cosmetic purposes, surgery contributes substantially to the cure of solid cancer at their infancy by removal of cancer tissue and lymph node. It has served as the only curative therapy for most solid tumours at an early stage, such as oesophagal cancer, gastric cancer, and colorectal cancer (CRC), to mention only a few (Table 1). However, a majority of cancer cases were diagnosed at locally advanced or even metastatic stages, limiting the applicability of curative surgery. The development of oncological surgery mainly focuses on decreasing its invasiveness that, on a basis of equivalent anticancer efficacy, may help minimize perioperative complications and postoperative side-effects, and ultimately improve patients' quality of life. Laparoscopic surgery has shown equivalent anticancer efficacy and lower incidence or intensity of complications, compared with open surgery in gastric cancer and colorectal cancer [40,41]. However, critics indicate that high-quality evidence from well-designed randomized clinical trials with sound methods is needed to justify the routine implementation of laparoscopic gastrectomy [42]. Furthermore, laparoscopic surgery in pancreatic or periampullary cancer and cervical cancer was associated with an inferior oncologic outcome compared with open surgery [43][44][45][46]. Endoscopic surgery has been applied in early oesophageal cancer, gastric cancer, and colorectal cancer in carefully selected patients in expert centres, such as T1a gastric cancer without lymph node metastasis [47][48][49][50]. Despite versatile flexibility of robotic surgery, its associated survival benefit and cost-effectiveness have been disputed, especially in mastectomy and other cancer-related surgeries Current major therapeutics for cancer. In the primary site, local treatments, including surgery, imaging-guided interventional procedure, and radiotherapy, can be applied with curative intent.",

            "text": "The present analysis of a large population based cancer data set suggests that cancer-directed surgery is independently associated with better survival, alone or in combination with radiotherapy, suggesting that multimodal surgery-based therapy can benefit MPM patients. The median survival of the group treated with surgery was double the value observed in those not receiving radiotherapy or surgery, or among those treated with radiotherapy. These differences are meaningful in a disease that has a very quick evolution and extremely short survival rate, and are very similar to what reported by others [4]. One aspect that needs to be considered is that the SEER program includes data from both general hospitals and highly specialized cancer centers, and the surgical techniques used may greatly differ between these two hospital settings. centers. However, the improved survival with multi-modal therapy reported here confirms results of individual studies conducted in Europe [4] or in the US [5] on smaller series. Bovolato et al showed a statistically significant improvement in patients who underwent a surgical approach versus those who were non-surgically treated [4]. Kapeles et al [5]suggests that patients treated with trimodality therapy have a significantly improved survival, but the result is not confirmed by others [6]. The Kapeles study however does not disentangle the effects of each individual procedure (surgery versus radiation versus chemotherapy); other predictors of survival were gender and age, similar to what we report here. Radiation for MPM has been shown to be effective in trials conducted at specialized centers [7] suggesting that such approach should be conducted by experts in the field. Results from our study indicate that surgery is the main determinant of survival, alone or in combination with radiation. \n\nThe present study follows a previously published SEER analysis from our group [8] on a smaller sample of patients (n = 5937), on the predictors of undergoing surgery. The study found that age, race and stage were main factors associated with the surgical approach, and provided the first evidence that surgery was associated with improved survival. However, the paper did not compare survival according to the different treatment approaches as we have done here.",

Outcomes for patients treated with surgery (92.3 (IQR 40.6-not reached)) were more favourable than those treated with SABR (65.3 (IQR 29.1-85.3), which were more favourable than those treated with CRRT (37.1 (IQR 18.5-59.6)) (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). Median OS was 41.6 (interquartile range (IQR) 15.4-95.8) months. A total of 407 (36%) patients were censored in whom minimum and median follow-up was 26.9 and 58.4 months, respectively. Age (\u226465, 65-74, 75-84, \u226585 years old), PS (0, 1, 2, 3+) and CCI (0, 1-2, 3) were independently associated with survival (Supplemental Figure S1) (each logrank p < 0.001). \n\nSurgery was the most frequently employed treatment modality (41%). Age, PS and comorbidities were important factors for treatment choice (Supplemental Figure S2). Patients treated with surgery were younger (median age 70 (IQR 63-75) v 78 (IQR 72-84), p < 0.001), of better PS (PS0/1 86% v 50%, p < 0.001) and less comorbid (CCI 0 54% v 45%, p < 0.001) than all other patients. A total of 82% of patients aged \u226465 and PS0 were treated surgically, whilst 74% of those aged \u226585 and PS2+ received no radical treatment (Supplemental Figure S3). \n\nOutcomes by Treatment Modality: As expected, patients with no radical treatment had the poorest survival (13.5 (IQR 5.3-30.3)) (Figure 1, Supplemental Table S2). Outcomes for patients treated with surgery (92.3 (IQR 40.6-not reached)) were more favourable than those treated with SABR (65.3 (IQR 29.1-85.3),",

            "text": "International Publisher improving patient outcome. If cancer cells are detected in the surrounding tissue excised during surgery, it is considered a \"positive tumor margin\", which is associated with poor prognosis, higher rates of recurrence and lower survival rates in various cancer types [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8]. Maneuvering between the two edges of damaging healthy tissues [9] and leaving residual disease is the main challenge during tumor resection that could certainly benefit from relying on more than the surgeon's naked eye. Image-guided surgery (IGS) has recently emerged as a complementary imaging technique to white light, supplying the surgeon an essential tool for the important goals mentioned above. The area of IGS has evolved rapidly during the last two decades, as reflected by the various imaging agents for different modalities, such as diffuse tensor imaging (DTI) and functional MRI (fMRI), that function as diagnostics before surgery to locate the tumor in relation to functional regions, and during surgery in order to assess the tumor margins [10][11][12][13][14][15]. However, these modalities lack the possibility of using targeted contrast agents to specifically visualize certain enzymes that are highly active at the tumor site, thus enabling better differentiation of cancerous from healthy tissue. In addition, intraoperative systems are costly and complex [16]. \n\nIntraoperative fluorescence imaging offers the benefits of high contrast and sensitivity, low cost, ease of use, safety, and visualization of cells and tissues both in vitro and in vivo [17,18]. Over the past several years, a vast amount of published data showed improved visualization of cancer tissue over dark background by the utilization of different fluorescent probes. One example of a clinically evaluated fluorescent \"Always ON\" low molecular weight (MW) probe includes a folate receptor-targeted fluorophore [19]. The current challenge of nearinfrared fluorescence (NIRF)-guided surgery is to design probes with high selectivity for tumors and clear visualization. To that end, different fluorescent probes have been developed and studied; these are often referred to as \"smart\" probes.",

This had led to the growth and advancement of radiology techniques. Over time, these techniques have iteratively become more accurate, multifunctional and provided increased ease to patients. Biopsies are essential to both diagnosis and treatment of oncological pathologies. Existing measures have provided excellent ways of diagnosing and treating patients; however, success rates can be limited depending on the technique. Further advances are being made to help improve patient comfort, diagnostic accuracy, and treatment. \n\nSeveral techniques are currently being employed in healthcare settings to identify, biopsy, and treat cancers. The most common image-guided biopsy methods are computed tomography (CT)-and ultrasound (US)guided biopsies. CT guidance is particularly good for deeper tissue biopsies and higher accuracy. US-guided biopsies are typically better for softer tissues that are relatively superficial. For example, typically biopsies located near the bones are conducted with the aid of CT guidance; however, breast biopsies are performed under the guidance of US. \n\nIn addition to CT-and US-guided biopsies, other imaging modalities, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided biopsies, are used. MRI-guided biopsy indications include non-palpable breast lesions as well as central nervous system (CNS) lesions, which can be better visualized with MRI.

            "text": "Breast cancer is primarily treated via surgical excision of the tumour with the surrounding normal breast tissue margin. In the early stage, these treatments take the form of breast-conserving surgery (BCS) or lumpectomy. 1 Although BCS provides satisfactory cosmetic outcomes, the re-resection rate is \u00bb20%, and of these surgeries, \u00bb85% are performed due to the presence of initial positive margins. 2 Although there is often a need for further surgery and additional tissue removal owing to the inherent challenges in achieving negative margins, existing guidelines recommend against excising a wider negative margin in routine practice. 3 Currently, surgeons rely primarily on visual and tactile cues to distinguish between healthy and malignant tissues and thus may leave residual lesions in the tumour bed. 4 MRI, mammography, ultrasound, and CT etc. are readily available imaging modalities typically used to assess the tumour lesion prior to the surgical procedure. Although these traditional imaging modalities have been of immense help in advancing tumour detection and determining the extent of resection(s), 5 the need for accurate intraoperative imaging remains one of the most important unmet needs in the management of breast cancer at the time of the initial BCS. \n\nExtensive research is ongoing to identify new, rapid, and accurate intraoperative margin assessment tools, some of which are currently undergoing clinical testing. 6 For example, among biophotonic-based techniques, image-guided surgery using fluorescence imaging offers many advantages for surgeons. Near-infrared (NIR) imaging is an emerging biomedical imaging modality for fluorescence-guided surgery because of its significant light absorption, ability to assist in real-time visualization, and lack of ionizing radiation. In vivo imaging in the NIR range (700\u00c0900 nm) is superior to that in the visible spectrum owing to its low scattering, negligible tissue autofluorescence, and relatively high tissue penetration. 7 The first FDA-approved NIR dye, indocyanine green (ICG), has been used in clinical practice to determine the liver function, cardiac output, and blood flow etc) for over fifty years due to its proven safety and the feasibility of its use. Also, ICG has been tested for tumour margin identification.",

            "text": "Another intraoperative imaging modality for reducing rates of margin positivity at initial surgery is IOUS, which can be performed by surgeons who are increasingly ultrasound competent. In a prospective observational cohort study, Karalik et al [13] undertook BCS guided by either ultrasound (n = 84) or palpation (n = 80) amongst two groups of women matched for demographic and tumour characteristics. \n\nUse of IOUS reduced the rate of re-excision from 17% for palpation-guided lumpectomy to only 6% with IOUS. (p = 0.03). Moreover, the volume of tissue resected in the palpation-guided group was significantly higher despite comparable tumour size (p = 0.048) and equivalent cosmetic outcomes. \n\nThe COBALT study is a prospective multicentre trial which addressed the hypothesis that use of IOUS for wide local excision of palpable breast cancers could potentially spare healthy tissue and improve both surgical margin status and cosmesis. The trial was conducted in the Netherlands, but accrued a relatively small number of patients in relation to the number of centres and participating surgeons. Notwithstanding this comment, the trial had 80% power to detect an 18% reduction in the re-excision rates. A total of 134 patients with palpable early stage primary invasive breast cancer (T1-2, N0-1) were randomised to either ultrasound-guided surgery (USS) or palpation-guided surgery (PGS). Some patients had invasive tumour associated with DCIS, which influenced rates of margin positivity. Nonetheless, use of ultrasound significantly increased the negative margin rate from 83% (PGS) to 94% (USS) (p = 0.03). Moreover, specimen volumes at first excision were significantly lower for the USS group compared with the PGS group (p = 0.048). The trial contained a quality-of-life sub-study and also examined cosmetic outcomes [14]. \n\nAnother familiar imaging modality is MRI which can be used for specimen radiography; however, this methodology within the context of surgical excision specimens is impractical, time consuming and unlikely to be cost-effective in any managed healthcare system.",

            "text": "For the staging of pancreatic cancer, CT is suggested as the optimal imaging modality to evaluate liver metastases, even in patients with small pancreatic cancers. [10] In conclusion, we determined that pancreatic cancer in our population has a poor prognosis, partly because of its delayed diagnosis and the lack of a surveillance protocol in our country. Over the last decade, a multimodality approach has been used to improve the prognosis of pancreatic cancer, particularly for those patients who are not candidates for curative surgery. On the basis of our data, different primary modes of treatment provide signifi cantly different survival results. However, based upon the disease stages and patient conditions, it is diffi cult to note which method affected the selection of treatment procedures. To directly compare the results of each treatment, the study must be well-controlled, and fair randomization should be applied to prevent selection bias. In our series, approximately 30% of our patients underwent curative surgery, which is similar to other large series. [11] Gemcitabine was the most commonly used chemotherapy in our series. \n\nUsing gemcitabine alone for pancreatic cancer seems to provide a greater benefi t over other chemotherapy modalities, as shown in other series. [12] Our study results indicate that the treatment plan for pancreatic cancer in this part of the world does not differ from those plans in other parts of the world. \n\nRegarding the treatment complications in each modality in our series, PTBD appeared to have the lowest complication rate. However, PTBD is not a permanent treatment and is inconvenient for long-term patient care. In patients who are candidates for curative surgeries, such as Whipple's operation, the complication rate is approximately 20%, which is similar to that of other studies. [13] For patients who require bypass procedures (e.g., ERCP and palliative bypass surgery), the complication rates were quite similar, approximately 20%. In comparison with the reported complication rates of ERCP from a series of ERCPs with stent placement in patients with malignant distal biliary strictures, the complication rates aligned with ours.

Initially, surgery is most effective, and tumor removal with negative margins of 1 to 2 cm, if possible, is recommended. Complete surgical resection of localized lesions is thought to be important for optimal outcomes [3]. ough the literature is inconclusive about the most effective use, radiotherapy is a good adjuvant treatment before or after surgery in more complex conditions, such as in the case of an incomplete resection or if the tumor is inoperable. We have previously published clinical outcomes after radiosurgery or whole brain radiation for brain metastasis of various histologic types [19,20]. Radiation therapy is especially utilized in cases with malignant SFT, narrow margins, tumor size greater than 10 cm, and fast-growing tumors [2]. For example, in an analysis of 102 SFT cases, Krengli et al. reported that local control was higher in patients who were treated with surgery plus postoperative radiation therapy when compared to surgery alone [21]. If the tumor has metastasized, adjuvant radiation therapy and sometimes chemotherapy are also used. However, Duranti et al. summarized their treatment of 337 patients with localized thoracic soft tissue sarcoma, where 51% received adjuvant radiotherapy and 41% received postoperative chemotherapy, and concluded the patients who received adjuvant radiotherapy presented with better local control than those who received adjuvant chemotherapy alone [22].\n\nWhen compared to brain metastasis from adenocarcinoma, brain metastasis from SFT is significantly less common. In a study of 16,210 patients with brain metastasis, the authors reported that brain metastasis from lung cancers (19.9%) occurs more frequently when compared to other types of cancer, such as melanoma (6.9%), renal (6.5%), breast (5.1%), and colorectal (1.8%) [4]. Another study reported similar outcomes with a higher incidence of brain metastasis in lung cancer (16.3%) when compared to renal carcinoma (9.8%), melanoma (7.4%), breast car",

Surgery remains the only treatment modality associated with a benefit in terms of sur vival [1] in gallbladder cancer. However, what is most disconcerting is the lack of consensus across the world on what constitutes an optimal operation for a given stage of the disease. Many of the surgical concepts in gallbladder cancer are based on what \"we think\" as appropriate. The confusion is aptly summed up by the paper by Sasaki et al [1] in which 16 different resections had been performed. The cause for all this uncertainty stems from the fact that this disease is relatively uncommon around the world and so hardly any (if at all) of the approaches have been evaluated in an evidence-based manner. Another confounding factor is the difference in the etiology and pathogenesis of the disease in Japan (from where most of the reported data on surgical management of gallbladder cancer arises) and the rest of the world [2] . This brings us to the question of whether we can draw conclusions from the existing literature that can aid us in deciding the correct surgery.",

[33] performed a phase II study and found that preoperative IMRT was associated with a reduction of 12.5% in wound complication rate in patients with high-grade lesions.In a nonrandomized comparison of IMRT and brachytherapy in patients with high-grade, primary, nonmetastatic STSs of the extremities, local control was significantly better with IMRT than brachytherapy (5-year local control rates were 92% and 81%, respectively; p = 0.04), despite higher rates of adverse features for the IMRT group [34].Moreover, image-guided techniques may allow for reduced target volumes [35], further minimizing toxicity.In a recent phase II trial (RTOG-0630; n = 86), the use of preoperative Image Guided RT (IGRT) to a reduced target volume resulted in a significantly reduced late toxicity without any marginal field recurrences [36].\n\nCancers 2023, 15,5572 There is now a changing therapeutic landscape with a growing trend towards the use of preoperative RT for the management of STSs [3,4].",

This expanded definition acknowledges the value of experiential diversity in enhancing surgical proficiency and patient outcomes.

The importance of centralization extends beyond technical and perioperative outcomes to include critical aspects such as ensuring appropriate neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapies, optimal patient selection for diverse treatment modalities, and comprehensive care planning. Therefore, while reevaluating the definition of surgical volume is essential, it should complement rather than replace the need for centralizing cancer care to achieve optimal outcomes for patients. \n\nDespite the encouraging implications of our findings, the retrospective nature of this study introduces inherent limitations, including potential selection bias and variations in surgical techniques, which may influence the outcomes and affect the generalizability of our findings. The exclusion of all cases lacking retrievable perioperative or mid-term outcomes or with < 3 months of follow-up, as well as the exclusion of the few McKnew or transhiatal approaches, which are associated to be more often chosen by less experienced surgeons in some studies [14,15], was aimed to partially mitigate this bias.",

            "text": "The treatment landscape for early-stage NSCLC has witnessed significant transformations, particularly with the shift toward less invasive sublobar resections from the traditional standard of lobectomy. This transition underscores the need for a nuanced and individualized approach to treatment selection, where factors such as patient demographics, tumor characteristics, and surgeon expertise play crucial roles. As the decision between lobectomy and sublobar resection becomes increasingly complex, it is imperative to involve experienced surgeons who can assess each patient's unique circumstances and recommend the most appropriate course of action. Surgeon experience, particularly in performing both lobectomy and sublobar resection, is paramount in ensuring optimal outcomes and minimizing potential complications. The role of neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy in conjunction with sublobar resection remains an area of active investigation. Understanding the impact of these additional treatment modalities on recurrence rates and overall survival is essential for optimizing treatment strategies and improving patient outcomes. Non-surgical ablative treatments, such as SBRT, are promising alternatives for early-stage NSCLC, particularly in patients unsuitable for surgery. While SBRT has demonstrated efficacy in achieving local tumor control, further research is needed to compare its effectiveness with surgical resection and elucidate its role within the broader treatment paradigm. Technological advancements, including 3D modeling and robotic-assisted surgery, promise to enhance the precision and visibility of sublobar resections. These innovations aim to reduce the risk of complications and improve surgical outcomes, ultimately benefiting patients undergoing minimally invasive lung cancer surgeries. Given the dynamic nature of NSCLC treatment paradigms, healthcare providers must stay abreast of the latest research findings and clinical guidelines. Patients should be actively engaged in shared decisionmaking processes, where they can discuss their preferences, concerns, and treatment goals with their healthcare team. In conclusion, while subjectivity inevitably plays a role in treatment decision-making, objective criteria such as tumor characteristics, surgical outcomes, and technological advancements serve as guiding principles for optimizing patient care. By embracing a multidisciplinary approach and incorporating the latest evidence-based practices, healthcare providers can ensure that patients with early-stage NSCLC receive the most effective and personalized treatment interventions.",

However, the detection of occult or additional malignant lesions using any imaging modality is the first step to optimal tumor control. Therefore, recognizing the types of breast cancer that present with more false lesions on MRI and providing recommendations on selectively performing MRI help prevent unnecessary examination and incomplete or excessive surgery. The aim of this study was to identify the effectiveness and provide suggestions for selective applications of preoperative MRI by investigating the sensitivity, positive predictive value, and clinicopathologic factors associated with false positivity and negativity of preoperative MRI in patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer.",

            "text": "At present, around 40% of cancer cures involve the use of radiotherapy, either as a single modality or in combination with other treatments such as surgery or chemotherapy. 1,2 Radiotherapy is also highly effective for palliation and for symptom control in patients with advanced stage or recurrent cancer. 3,4 In addition, an increasing body of evidence now supports the use of high-dose radiotherapy in the treatment of oligometastatic disease; radiation is delivered to a small number of metastases, with studies showing improved local control rates for several tumour sites. [5][6][7] Over the past decade, a number of significant technical developments, such as image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT), intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) and proton beam therapy (PBT), have enabled the concept of 'precision radiotherapy' to be advanced rapidly. 8 Such advanced radiotherapy techniques facilitate greater conformity, reduced planning margins and the delivery of an increased dose to the tumour, potentially resulting in improved patient outcomes. 5,6,9 The delivery of highly conformal, high-dose radiotherapy is, however, challenging due to uncertainties in the accuracy of imaging, treatment planning, treatment delivery and even changes in tumour size during treatment. The integration of imaging technology into modern radiotherapy treatment machines has led to an increase in the precision and accuracy of radiation delivery. 10 Imaging throughout a course of radiation treatment enables anatomical changes to be detected, and radiation plans to be adapted accordingly. Indeed, adaptive radiotherapy, whereby an individual plan can be created for each treatment fraction depending on the precise positioning, and shape, of the tumour at the time of imaging, is a new goal for radiation oncology. For this goal to become a realistic possibility, advanced imaging and the integration of automated segmentation processes for the delineation of target volumes and surrounding structures need to be developed. The first step in being able to deliver precision radiotherapy is accurate target delineation during the radiotherapy planning process.

            "text": "In the MERCURY study, where preoperative MRI was correlated with pathological assessment of the resected specimen, MRI accurately predicted extramural depth of invasion to within 0.5 mm, which makes it the optimal imaging modality for assessing higher-risk mrT3 tumours 8 . In addition, MRI predicted the relationship of the tumour to the mesorectal fascia and an mrCRM clear margin was reported with an accuracy of 94% at detailed pathological assessment of the resected specimen 20 . Substantial variation exists in the indication for neoadjuvant treatment across the UK, with on average 37% of patients with rectal cancer receiving nCRT 21 . The current indications for nCRT within the National UK NICE guidelines 22 are controversial and seem to be associated with possible overtreatment in a proportion of patients 23 . The selective criteria adopted in our unit resulted in a relatively small proportion of patients undergoing nCRT (17%) 24 . Notably, mrCRM in multivariable analysis was not an independent risk factor for DFS, suggesting that selective nCRT and optimal precision surgery might mitigate the negative prognosis of mrCRM-involved rectal cancer. A recent national cross-sectional cohort study in the Netherlands reported that a reduction in preoperative radiotherapy use by 50% for non-locally advanced rectal cancer did not compromise cancer-related outcomes and was instead associated with improved overall survival 25 : in 2011, neoadjuvant radiotherapy was used in 86% of patients with rectal cancer, while this proportion was 37% in the 2016 cohort. The LR at 4 years was 5.8% and 5.5%, respectively (P = 0.999). In the 2016 cohort, 4-year OS was significantly higher (86.4% versus 79.6%; P < 0.001) with lower non-cancer-related mortality (6.7% versus 13.7%; P < 0.001). \n\nThere are several limitations in this study. This is a retrospective study of a cohort of patients treated at a single centre over a period of 12 years, with intrinsic biases including variations in clinical practice, particularly related to increased adoption of a deferral of surgery and W&W approach after a cCR.",

            "text": "Over the past few decades, the literature has demonstrated a growing interest in reirradiation cases [24,25]. Due to factors such as accumulated prior dose and anatomical changes, these cases require more complex planning. In the presented case, the patient's distinctive anatomical circumstances, arising from prior surgeries and radiation treatment, necessitated a tailored therapeutic strategy. Consequently, the utilization of ultra-hypofractionated CK therapy alongside androgen deprivation therapy was deemed to be the optimal approach. After a thorough assessment of the patient's medical history and considering the time that elapsed since the previous rectal cancer treatment, the treatment team ascertained that the current dosage and approach hold promising curative potential for management of the localized PCa. \n\nThe CK system has demonstrated a wide range of application for treating primary or recurrent tumors, as well as small metastatic lesions, providing excellent local control and minimal toxicity, even in cases of previous surgery or radiotherapy [26]. The system utilizes integrated digital X-ray imaging, enabling the use of bone landmarks or gold fiducial markers, which are used to set up the patient and track the position of the target volume throughout the entire treatment course. \n\nRadio-opaque markers could be inserted using different approaches. In general, imageguided procedures such as percutaneous biopsies, ablations or marker placements rely heavily on the accuracy of imaging visualization. Ultrasound (US) is commonly used to guide interventions in the abdomen, mainly due to its real-time capabilities and its ability to select non-axial approaches. However, finding an adequate acoustic window might not always be easy. CT provides a broader field of view and is not limited by the presence of air or bones, but requires an axial or near-axial approach and lacks real-time capabilities. Technological advancements now allow for the real-time fusion of US and CT images, enhancing the guidance of percutaneous procedures and overcoming the limitations of each individual imaging modality [27,28]. \n\nIn addition, the application of an EMN facilitates virtual navigation within a preacquired imaging dataset right within the interventional room, thereby enabling unconventional approaches.",

Early stage tumours of the lip (stages I and II) are treated with single modality treatment, using either radiotherapy [external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) or brachytherapy] or surgery. Locally advanced tumours (stages III and IVa) are treated with surgery followed by adjuvant treatment. The aim of the present study was to retrospectively evaluate the clinical profile and treatment outcomes of patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the lip who were treated with radical intent at the Regional Cancer Centre (Thiruvananthapuram, India). For this purpose, a total of 120 patients treated with radical radiotherapy (brachytherapy or EBRT) or surgery with or without adjuvant treatment between January 2010 and December 2016 were eligible for the analysis. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to generate the survival outcomes. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine the impact of various patient- and tumour-related factors and treatment modality on outcomes. At a median follow-up time of 67.6 months, the disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) rates at 4 years for the entire cohort were 69.1 and 86.7%, respectively. The 4-year OS rates for patients with stage I, II, III and IV disease were 88.9, 95.2, 86.8 and 75.3%, respectively, and the DFS rates were 83.6, 69.5, 78.8 and 42.9%, respectively. Primary tumour (P=0.025), nodal (P=0.005) and composite clinical (P=0.006) stage were found to be significant factors affecting DFS rates in the univariate analysis. However, only the nodal stage (P=0.005) was found to be a significant factor affecting DFS rates in the multivariate analysis. On the whole, the present study demonstrates that the outcomes of patients with lip carcinoma are favourable when treated at the early stages, and the results from this series are in line with those already published.",

Surgery and radiotherapy are particularly beneficial for stage I and II BC, whereas stage III and IV BC patients usually require the chemotherapy. These treatment modalities can be used alone or in combination for more effective therapeutic outcomes. For example, the surgical resection of localized tumors can be followed by the chemotherapy to kill any remnants of BC cells/tissues. Chemotherapy can also be administered before surgery to shrink the tumor to minimize damage during the surgery. Chemotherapy and radiation can also be administered together to improve the therapeutic outcomes and mitigate chemoresistance and recurrence in cancer. 11 Despite the several advantages, conventional treatment modalities are associated with several adverse events that reduce their therapeutic significance and patient compliance. 12,13 To overcome these challenges, the safer, selective, targeted, and more efficacious treatments are urgently needed for the management of BC. [14][15][16] Nanotechnology has emerged as a promising technology to mitigate most of the challenges associated with conventional treatments of BC. 17,18 Nanotechnology can be defined as the design, characterization, manipulation, and application of nanoscaled (1-1000 nm) materials. Like many other fields, the deployment of nanotechnology in chemotherapy has shown promising results in improving the therapeutic outcomes in BC treatment while mitigating the side effects associated with chemotherapy. Tumor targeting is one of the most investigated aspects of nanotechnology for the early detection and targeted treatment of different types of cancer. 19,20",

            "text": "Simple Summary Image-guided solid tumor ablation therapy is an expanding practice designed to effectively target and eradicate malignant tissue through noninvasive or minimally invasive techniques. There exist several ablation systems that can utilize localized heating or mechanical stress to induce cell death of malignant cells. The provider selects a technique based on patient comorbidities, the type of malignancy, the size and location of the tumor, and the desired goal of therapy. Over the past two decades, several studies have validated the safety and efficacy of these techniques in humans to be used as an alternative to medical and surgical therapy or as an adjunct in a hybrid treatment plan. Compared to conventional surgical therapies, these procedures are better tolerated, with reduced morbidity and mortality, providing options to patients that are not surgical candidates. This article reviews the new and common techniques in solid tumor ablation and the research supporting their use in oncological treatment. Abstract Image-guided solid tumor ablation methods have significantly advanced in their capability to target primary and metastatic tumors. These techniques involve noninvasive or percutaneous insertion of applicators to induce thermal, electrochemical, or mechanical stress on malignant tissue to cause tissue destruction and apoptosis of the tumor margins. Ablation offers substantially lower risks compared to traditional methods. Benefits include shorter recovery periods, reduced bleeding, and greater preservation of organ parenchyma compared to surgical intervention. Due to the reduced morbidity and mortality, image-guided tumor ablation offers new opportunities for treatment in cancer patients who are not candidates for resection. Currently, image-guided ablation techniques are utilized for treating primary and metastatic tumors in various organs with both curative and palliative intent, including the liver, pancreas, kidneys, thyroid, parathyroid, prostate, lung, breast, bone, and soft tissue. The invention of new equipment and techniques is expanding the criteria of eligible patients for therapy, as now larger and more high-risk tumors near critical structures can be ablated. This article provides an overview of the different imaging modalities, noninvasive, and percutaneous ablation techniques available and discusses their applications and associated complications across various organs.",

            "text": "Rectal cancer is a global disease associated with poor outcomes if not properly staged and treated. The increased use of preoperative chemoradiation and refinement of surgical techniques have led to a greater proportion of patients being considered for curative resection. New surgical options exist for these patients in the form of sphincter saving resection or transanal excision in selected circumstances. For the vast majority of rectal carcinomas, MRI is currently the most accurate modality on which to base treatment decisions for patients with rectal cancer. Traditionally, the decision to apply preoperative treatment for rectal cancer patients has been based on the T-and N-stage. Lately, other MRI findings such as the radial distance of the tumor to the CRM and extramural vascular invasion score have been identified as important risk factors for local failure and survival. We strongly believe that every center that treats patients with rectal cancer should develop a multidisciplinary team featuring a description of the MRI findings and their implementation in the treatment strategy with the aim of increasing resectability, reducing the local recurrence and treatment morbidity, and improving the quality of life.",

            "text": "In most Western countries, long-term survival has doubled for some cancers, such as breast and colon cancer, over the past 40 years through early detection, the use of effective combined treatment modalities, radiation, and/or systemic treatment, reducing the 30-day postoperative mortality due to improved surgical techniques, surgical equipment with less intraoperative and postoperative bleeding, and, last but not least, anesthesia and intensive care facilities. Today, personalized cancer surgery has become a reality with the conservation of the integrity and function of the body and the preservation of quality of life. Compared with LMICs, surgeons in HICs have the ability to stage cancer patients using computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and/or sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), and to use effective combined treatment modalities with the various radiation techniques, treatment planning, radiation doses, and systemic approaches ranging from hormonal, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy to targeted drug therapy, as well as the various surgical interventions, from conventional surgery and laparoscopic procedures to robotic and image-guided surgery. For many types of cancer, surgery has plateaued as a treatment in regard to morbidity and mortality, local control, and longterm survival, whereas, in palliative care, the role of surgery is explored continuously. New developments are still being made in minimally invasive surgery, such as singleincision laparoscopic surgery, robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery, transanal endoscopic microsurgery, and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery. 6 All these procedures are accompanied by steep learning curves and require centralization of the surgical care of these cancer patients. \n\nThere is significant diversity in surgical (oncology) training programs and certification requirements, with an inverse correlation to a country's income. Almost all HIC and LMIC surgical (sub)specializations are organ-based rather than focused on oncology, with significant variability in the training of surgical oncologists worldwide. 7 though today most LMICs do not have these structured surgical oncology training pathways, at the same time, a few LMICs have had structured surgical oncology fellowships in place for a number of decades now.",

            "text": "In this study, we analyzed the effects of different local treatment modalities on the survival of patients with stage IB1 and IIA1 cervical SCC using a population-based database. Our results found that the survival outcomes were similar between radical hysterectomy and definitive radiochemotherapy in both matched and unmatched populations. The current National Comprehensive Cancer Network Guidelines recommend radical surgery or definitive RT with or without chemotherapy as alternative treatments for stage IB1 and IIA1 CC. 9 However, surgical treatment is still the main local treatment used for early-stage CC. In our study, the vast majority of patients (96.9%) received surgery-based treatment, and definitive radiochemotherapy was rarely used before 2000, which is related to the inclusion criteria in our study. Since 1999, five randomized trials have confirmed the clinical value of concurrent radiochemotherapy for bulky stage IB CC, high-risk early-stage CC after radical surgery, and locally advanced CC. [18][19][20][21][22] In patients who received definitive RT, radiochemotherapy (66.7%) was also the main treatment employed for stage IB1 and IIA1 CC in the recent National Cancer Database study and was associated with improved survival compared with definitive RT alone. 14 The introduction of radiochemotherapy in the treatment of stage IB1 and IIA1 CC has gradually increased in recent years. However, radical surgery is still the most frequent treatment from 2000 to 2010.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, there have been a total of five studies focusing on the survival differences between surgery and definitive RT/radiochemotherapy in patients with earlystage CC in the last two decades, 10,11,[23][24][25] and the optimal local treatment modality in these patients remains controversial. A randomized study by Landoni et al 13 found equal survival rates between radical surgery and RT for stage IB-IIA cervical SCC. The 20-year OS rates associated with the two local treatment modalities were comparable in SCC subtype (72% vs 77%, p=0.280). 23 A retrospective study from Japan also found no statistically significant difference in survival for stage IA-IIB CC patients who received surgery (",

Many studies were ruled out as part of our protocol due to the stratification of results with respect to laryngeal subsite and staging criteria (including advanced stage disease). The method in which functional results are reported, is often less rigorous than the reporting of survival and locoregional control. The use of objective measures and validated tools was limited and not consistent across studies. \n\nTraditionally, studies comparing surgery and radiation have been challenging to accrue patients to. Ongoing efforts comparing OPS to RT for oropharyngeal cancer are underway and actively accruing [60,61], demonstrating that a head-to-head comparison of surgery and radiation is a possibility for patients with early stage supraglottic cancer. High level of evidence is important in the development of treatment guidelines for patients with early stage disease that have a surprisingly poor prognosis, compared to other early stage head and neck cancers. Traditionally, OPS has been seen as an option with poor functional outcomes. We did not find evidence to support one modality being better than another with respect to functional outcomes.",

            "text": "Ovarian cancer is one of the most lethal gynecologic cancers [1]. More than 70% of patients with ovarian cancer are diagnosed at an advanced stage (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics [FIGO] stage III or IV), and the 5-year survival rate is less than 30% [2]. To improve the survival of advanced ovarian cancer patients, optimal cytoreductive surgery (e.g., maximum diameter of 1 cm or less for the largest residual tumor mass) followed by postoperative platinum/taxane combination chemotherapy are the cornerstones of treatment [3,4]. The success rate for achievement of optimal cytoreduction varies widely, from 15 to 85%, in the literature [5]. However, if patients fail to achieve optimal cytoreduction, they may experience major morbidity without any survival benefit [6]. Therefore, a significant proportion of women with advanced ovarian cancer may undergo a debulking operation and experience the associated morbidity without any survival gains. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking surgery is an alternative treatment option to overcome situations in which it is difficult to achieve primary optimal cytoreduction [7]. Therefore, precise pretreatment discrimination of patients who are not amenable to optimal cytoreduction may be one of the principal determinants to reduce surgical morbidity. \n\nIn order to identify the patients who are less likely to benefit from primary cytoreductive surgery, several attempts have been made to determine specific predictors of cytoreductive outcome, including imaging modalities, tumor markers, and laparoscopic scores [8][9][10]. F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG PET/CT) may be helpful in validating the selection and management of recurrent ovarian cancer patients by identification of extra-abdominal disease and may allow adequate planning of surgical debulking at retroperitoneal, hepatic, or splenic sites [11,12]. However, the role of FDG PET/CT in predicting the outcome of primary optimal cytoreductive surgery for advanced ovarian cancer has not been reported.",

            "text": "Despite recent improvements in prevention, early diagnosis, and treatment, colon cancer (CC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related death [1]. To date, surgery is the only treatment for locally advanced disease, being well defined for most tumor locations. Anatomical standard resections are worldwide accepted for right-and left-sided cancers, while tumors of the transverse colon (TC) and of the splenic flexure (SF) are actually treated either with extended or segmental colectomies [2].\n\nBoth these cancers show a lower incidence as compared with other locations and are characterized by a poor prognosis [3][4][5][6]; mostly due to a variable lymphatic drainage and a late diagnosis. Hence, many authors have suggested extensive resections with the aim to improve oncological outcomes [7][8][9][10]. However, the optimal surgical treatment concerning postoperative and oncological outcomes is still under debate [11][12][13].\n\nMoreover, several studies have investigated not only the extension of colonic resection and lymphadenectomy, but also the type of approach, comparing open (O) versus minimally invasive (MI) surgery [14][15][16].\n\nEffectively, MI surgery has spread substantially over the past decade, and access to laparoscopic equipment is now nearly universal [17]. Still, wide variations in the adoption of laparoscopic approach across different hospital types and geographic regions exist, but referral centers and teaching hospitals all over the world have certainly acquired the skill to face all CC surgery without the need to open the abdomen.\n\nHowever, despite this spread, to date, no trial has documented a real survival advantage of MI vs O surgery for any location of CC, except from a single-center, low-volume trial which harbored several limitations [18].\n\nRecently, our nationwide retrospective study including 1304 patients with SF cancers (SFCs) submitted to surgery assessed the safety and efficacy of segmental as compared to extended resection [13]. In this study, segmental resection was proved to be an adequate option in case of colonic cancer at this site. This procedure was performed in 791 patients, and an MI approach was adopted in about 60% of them",

            "text": "Cervical cancer is the fourth most common malignant tumor and the fourth leading cause of death among women worldwide. In 2020, there were an estimated 604,000 new cases and 342,000 deaths worldwide [1]. Although early-stage cervical cancer portends a favorable prognosis, a large tumor size (>4 cm) is associated with worse survival and more local pelvic recurrence than a smaller tumor, regardless of treatment modality [2][3][4]. For early bulky tumors, treatment options include radical surgery (radical hysterectomy and lymphadenectomy) with or without adjuvant therapy, primary radiation, or concurrent chemoradiation. However, the optimal treatment is still under debate. \n\nA previous randomized study [3] showed equivalent effectiveness by either primary surgery or radiotherapy, whereas two Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) [5,6] studies revealed that surgery improved survival. Bansal et al. [5] reported that radical hysterectomy was associated with a 49% reduction in the mortality rate for 4-6 cm tumors but equivalent survival for >6 cm tumors compared with primary radiation. Moreover, radical hysterectomy with tailored adjuvant therapy has been suggested because it is the most cost-effective strategy in early bulky cervical tumors compared with primary chemoradiation [7,8]. Concerning the inconsistent conclusion from the above studies [3,5,6], there is a need to clarify suitable treatment modalities in this patient population. \n\nIn addition to tumor size, clinical prognostic factors, including tumor markers (SCC and CEA levels) and tumor histology (squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma), also have an impact on treatment response and survival [9][10][11]. The prognostic factors could be considered when determining better treatment options. However, there is a paucity of data on risk stratification for early-stage bulky tumors to guide treatment modality. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess the difference in clinical outcomes in patients who were grouped by their different prognoses between surgery and primary chemoradiation.",

            "text": "e endoscope also provides a wider and multiangle close-up view which is of much importance in the surgical field [32]. For diseases like rectal cancer, MRI plays a key role as it can accurately depict the local extent of the cancer and generates relevant information required for prognoses which can directly influence the choice of the optimal therapeutic procedure used for each individual patient which encourages the area of personalized medicine [33]. \n\nIt is to be noted that when image-guided surgeries are compared with conventional surgical approaches, imageguided surgeries are less invasive, have more precise targeting, and have improved outcomes. Imaging is used to plan, monitor progress, and to assess results. In neurosurgery, this is more crucial as the object of the surgical procedure is hard to be located and needs to be reached with minimum damage to the healthy tissues. Apart from it, to guide the placement of the surgical instruments and to ensure that the required tissue is being treated, medical imaging is vital. At present, a wide variety of medical imaging modalities are being used such as magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, ultrasound, positron emission tomography, single-photon emission computed tomography, fluoroscopy, and so on to perform different assessments like biopsies, tumour resection, epilepsy, vascular conditions, and so on [34]. Medical image analysis is evolving day by day with the development of technology. \n\nis is further assisted by 3D virtual model creation as well to improve understanding of complex anatomy and to provide powerful tools for surgical planning and intraoperative guidance. Nowadays, the use of 3D ultrasound and fetal MRI is also becoming common in clinical practice [35]. \n\ne interesting fact is how machine learning could be integrated with these medical imaging techniques to make better decisions in surgical planning. It is to be noted that using machine learning, it is possible to understand hidden relationships which may not directly be visible to humans when observing multiple data. is is the reason that even disease predictions in healthcare have been made possible through machine learning approaches.",

            "text": "Simple Summary Rectal cancer has the capacity to present in a variety of forms. Depending on subtle differences in the characteristics of the tumor, it is possible for the treatment protocol to vary drastically. There are many tools available to optimize patients\u2019 outcomes when treating rectal cancer of these various stages. Advances in early-stage, local presentation of rectal cancer focus on minimally invasive endoluminal surgery. Lesions completely responding to neoadjuvant chemoradiation non-operative surveillance have been explored. For rectal cancers patients with problematic pelvic anatomy, new platforms for resection, such as transanal total mesorectal excision and robotic total mesorectal excision, have been introduced. Late solid organ and peritoneal metastasis, originally thought to be a terminal disease, have undergone recent advances in hepatic and pulmonary metastasectomy, cytoreductive surgery, and intraperitoneal chemotherapy. Understanding these various therapeutic interventions will pave the way for improved patient outcomes. Abstract It is important to understand advances in treatment options for rectal cancer. We attempt to highlight advances in rectal cancer treatment in the form of a systematic review. Early-stage rectal cancer focuses on minimally invasive endoluminal surgery, with importance placed on patient selection as the driving factor for improved outcomes. To achieve a complete pathologic response, various neoadjuvant chemoradiation regimens have been employed. Short-course radiation therapy, total neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and others provide unique advantages with select patient populations best suited for each. With a clinical complete response, a \u201cwatch and wait\u201d non-operative surveillance has been introduced with preliminary equivalency to radical resection. Various modalities for total mesorectal excision, such as robotic or transanal, have advantages and can be utilized in select patient populations. Tumors demonstrating solid organ or peritoneal spread, traditionally defined as unresectable lesions conveying a terminal diagnosis, have recently undergone advances in hepatic and pulmonary metastasectomy. Hepatic and pulmonary metastasectomy has demonstrated clear advantages in 5-year survival over standard chemotherapy. With the peritoneal spread of colorectal cancer, HIPEC with cytoreductive therapy has emerged as the preferred treatment. Understanding",

            "text": "As we enter the fourth decade of minimally invasive surgery, its popularity for rectal cancer surgery continues to grow. Of the four surgical modalities to perform an oncological resection, there is no convincing evidence to rate one superior to any other as long as the set goals are met. More impact on outcomes than the choice of approach appears to have (1) whether or not to perform an oncological resection versus a local excision by any means; and (2) the selection, tailoring, and timing of non-surgical treatment modalities. \n\nUnquestionably, the rates of minimally invasive surgery continue to increase worldwide each year despite initial skepticism and concerns about noninferiority and cost. The exact path and role each modality will take remains to be seen. The early driving force and support most prominently come from both patients' and surgeons' perceptions that patients tend to experience a smoother short-and long-term recovery while achieving comparable oncological outcomes. Unfortunately, this biased impression remains a major obstacle to systematic randomized research. Maintaining support in the longer run therefore mostly builds on at least equal if not superior outcomes, and the force of routine and familiarity of the surgical community that individually and collectively move past the learning curves. Except for the Norwegian moratorium on TaTME, there has been no large study that has shown significant inferiority of the minimally invasive approach to open surgery. \n\nThe main factors that will drive the future of rectal cancer surgery are selection, outcomes, access, technology, and standardization. It is highly unlikely that there will be a trial to compare all different modalities in a direct fashion. Further trials will continue to give us a patchy picture with select comparisons. For example in regard to defining the role of TaTME, there are currently two large RCTs underway comparing it to a laparoscopic TME. The first is the European COLOR III trial with the target enrollment of 1098 patients and the primary outcome the positive CRM [75,76] . The second is the smaller French GRECCAR 11 trial with similar setup [77] . \n\nThe major factor defining the future of minimally invasive surgery for rectal cancer is access and costs. With each new modality, new instruments, tools and infrastructure are developed with respective associated costs.",

            "text": "Therefore, minimising treatment delays is crucial for improving patient outcomes and ensuring timely, effective care. \n\nOur study found that patients diagnosed and treated at the localised stage consistently had higher survival rates across all treatment types compared to those diagnosed at the distant stage. Early diagnosis plays a crucial role in improving outcomes, as it often leads to the diagnosis at early stage. At the localised stage, surgical intervention can be particularly effective, as it often results in minimal residual disease and a reduced risk of recurrence [43]. However, distant stage cancer is more challenging to treat due to its spread and potential resistance to therapies, including mechanisms such as drug inactivation, active  [44]. When stratified by cancer stage, we found no significant differences across different treatment modalities, suggesting that within each stage, treatment choices may not necessarily lead to varying survival outcomes. This observation is consistent with findings that treatment decisions are often guided by factors such as tumour subtype, cancer stage, and patient preferences, rather than the expectation of different survival benefits [45]. Despite our small sample size, multi-modal approaches have been found to be particularly beneficial for patients who can tolerate additional treatments. In our study, patients treated with chemotherapy alone had the lowest survival rates (RS: 85.0% and OS: 82.0%). However, when chemotherapy was combined with surgery, radiotherapy, or hormonal therapy, survival outcomes improved significantly. These findings support existing evidence that multi-modal approaches may be beneficial in improving patient outcomes, emphasising the need for personalised treatment strategies [46]. Recent advancements, such as the use of CDK4/6 inhibitors in combination with hormonal therapy, have further enhanced outcomes in highrisk, hormone receptor-positive breast cancer patients, particularly in the adjuvant setting [47]. Adapting treatment strategies to the specific characteristics of each tumour can greatly improve treatment effectiveness and patient survival. Patients receiving multiple adjuvant treatments tend to show better survival rates. Adjuvant treatments targets different aspects of the cancer biology, making it more challenging for cancer cells to develop resistance and reduce risk of recurrence in the later years [48].",

            "text": "Nowadays, radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy are considered the standard primary modality for many types of cancer. Application of radiotherapy for some cancers is based on well-designed RCTs, such as those researching cervical cancer [8]. For some cancers, clinical experiences and related studies have enabled the acceptance of radiotherapy as a standard primary modality. Clinical data accumulated since the 1970s [9,10], when anal cancers began to be treated using chemoradiation without the use of a stoma, established concurrent chemoradiation as the primary intervention [11]. Radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy have produced similar oncologic outcomes to those of surgery for head and neck cancer [12,13] and prostate cancer [14,15]; the treatment modality is selectively applied depending on the physician's discretion, clinical situation, or patient's preference. The number of published meta-analyses has also rapidly increased following the broadening of indications for these modalities ( Figure 1). While there are some diseases (including the abovementioned) for which the role of radiation therapy is established, its effectiveness against other malignancies remains controversial. Treating early lung cancer with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) has attracted attention in recent decades owing to its curative role. Although RCTs comparing SBRT and surgery have shown promising results with SBRT, criticisms including poor accrual and imperfect study designs are difficult to avoid [16]; hence, SBRT is commonly indicated only for inoperable cases [17]. The prevalence of liver cancer is overwhelmingly higher in East Asia than in Europe [5], and based on their abundant clinical experiences, researchers in East Asia have found radiation therapy to be effective against intractable liver cancer [18][19][20]. However, some international guidelines still do not recognize radiotherapy as a standard intervention, mainly because of the low level of evidence given the lack of properly designed RCTs [21].

            "text": "Breast cancer has replaced lung cancer as the most frequently diagnosed cancer globally in the latest report by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (1). An estimated 685,000 women died from breast cancer in 2020, corresponding to 1 in every 6 cancer deaths in women (2). Breast cancer patients nowadays often are treated by breast-conserving surgery (BCS) followed by radiation therapy (RT). RT after BCS is indicated for ductal carcinoma in situ (stage 0), since RT greatly lowers the risk of local recurrence (3). In early (stage I-II) invasive breast cancer, adjuvant RT followed by BCS remains a standard of care (4). Based upon high level evidence for those with stage III-IV, RT is essential for selected patients after neoadjuvant systemic treatment followed by BCS or modified radical mastectomy (MRM) (4). Since RT may be recommended for all stages, the implications of different modalities of image guided radiotherapy (IGRT) are the keys to precision treatment for patients with breast cancer after BCS or MRM as well as for those with recurrence or distant metastasis (5). \n\nThe advance of both modern on-board imaging and planning software are required for adaptive treatment planning which had long been proposed (6). It has been challenging that thoracic radiotherapy such as that for breast irradiation has large inter-fractional and intrafractional organ movement variation causing unwanted radiationinduced complications such as cardiac and pulmonary toxicities. Some used mechanical ventilation and surface-image mapping system to reduce the within-patient variability of breathing for breast cancer patients (7). A mounting body of evidence strongly supports IGRT (8)(9)(10)(11)(12)(13)(14)(15)(16)(17). Until recently, image guidance was only performed prior to radiation treatment without simultaneous tracking. Magnetic resonance imaging-guided radiotherapy (MRgRT) has lately emerged as the state-of-the-art science in precision RT. It enables Radiation Oncologists to actually see the targets in relation to surrounding normal tissue during treatment (18,19).",

Liu et al. conducted a study in 2019 including 39 patients with histologically confirmed bulky cervical cancer (IB3, IIA2, and IIB stages according to the 2018 FIGO staging system) treated with NACT followed by radical hysterectomy. In 18 patients, the intervention was performed robotically, while in 21 patients, it was conducted through conventional abdominal surgery. Their results showed that patients treated with robotic surgery had better perioperative outcomes but not better survival outcomes. Furthermore, the robotic approach was associated with higher recurrence and mortality rates [28]. However, the available data are limited, and further studies are needed to draw definitive conclusions. Table 1 summarizes the main characteristics and survival outcomes of the available evidence regarding radical hysterectomy in patients with bulky tumors.",

Furthermore, unlike radiotherapy, it can be applied multiple times with overlapping treatment fields. This added therapeutic 'manoeuvring room' provides patients with more options and as demonstrated by the data, an improved quality of life. \n\nThe drawback of image-guided PDT is that it requires some extra equipment and training, neither of which is exorbitant when compared with the capital outlay of surgery or radiotherapy, with their associated complications, which would have been avoided by the use of this technology. The advantage of the technique is that PDT is now delivered to a target volume (which represents the disease volume with a margin of normal tissue) and can be mapped. It also means that PDT has evolved from depending upon just surface illumination to a modality that can now be used to treat deeper-seated lesions. \n\nIn summary, the growing body of evidence regarding the efficacy of PDT suggests that it will have a leading role in interventional hard tissue oncology, especially when managing spinal metastatic disease.",

            "text": "Staging systems (SS) like the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) SS provide standardized frameworks for classifying OPSCC based on tumor size, lymph node involvement, and distant metastases, aiding in treatment decisions and prognostic assessments [35]. Early-stage OPSCC, typically classified as T1-T2 tumors, can often be effectively treated with single modalities like surgery or radiation therapy. Minimally invasive surgical techniques such as transoral robotic surgery (TORS) and transoral laser microsurgery (TLM) offer improved functional outcomes and reduced morbidity compared to traditional open surgery [36,37]. Conversely, advanced-stage OPSCC may necessitate multimodality treatment approaches involving surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy [38]. \n\nDespite optimal initial treatment, some OPSCC patients face disease recurrence or persistence, leading to the consideration of salvage therapies such as re-irradiation or systemic therapy based on disease extent and patient health status [39][40][41]. Recent research has focused on de-escalating treatment intensity to minimize long-term toxicities while maintaining disease control, emphasizing personalized treatment approaches tailored to individual patient factors and tumor characteristics [42][43][44]. \n\nThe management of OPSCC is a multifaceted journey that, while striving for optimal therapeutic outcomes, is not without potential complications linked to both the disease itself and the modalities employed in its treatment. \n\nSurgery, particularly transoral procedures like transoral robotic surgery (TORS) and transoral laser microsurgery (TLM), is crucial for managing early-stage OPSCC and when organ preservation is not feasible.",

            "text": "Invasive cancer care is primarily dictated by the histology of the tumor, the stage of cancer, patient preference, and success status (2). The primary treatment modalities are surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy (20). For the majority of solid tumors, surgery remains the best therapy. Surgery could be possible in only a small subset of patients depending on the type of cancer (21). Some modalities including chemotherapy and radiation therapy are probably paired with surgery. However, major side effects such as fatigue, diarrhea, xerostomia, and secondary malignancies may be associated with these therapies (22). Radiation therapy is the use of ionizing radiation for directly treating the cancerous tumor rather than the whole body. Chemotherapy is used to cure the whole body and applies to chemical treatment which quickly destroys all dividing cells (23). \n\nDepending on the method of procedure , two types of procedures are commonly used in combination with each other, including neoadjuvant (pre-surgery), adjuvant (postsurgery), and concomitant treatment where radiotherapy and chemotherapy are employed with each other without operation (24). The integration of chemotherapy and radiation treatment helps many approaches to attack tumors and thus can help avoid the immunity of cancer cells to either therapy (25,26). The general course of therapy during neoadjuvant therapy includes radiation treatment accompanied by chemotherapy. It could be used to minimize tumor dimension. It has been shown that this method of treatment increases the survival rate of many cancer patients (24). \n\nAdjuvant therapy is often used after surgery as there is a possibility that some cancer cells in the patient will still be present. There are five main types of adjuvant therapy for the treatment of cancer, including chemotherapy, hormonal, radiation, immune, and targeted therapy. The type of user is dictated by the type and level of cancer, as well as hormone tolerance and involvement of the lymph node (27).",

            "text": "Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women in Europe with an incidence of 523,000 new cases every year and is the third leading cause of death from cancer with 135,000 women every year [1]. Despite improved techniques, establishing tumor-negative margins remains the greatest challenge in breast cancer surgery for successful treatment and favorable patient outcome. With the increased appliance of breast conservative surgery, positive surgical margin rates of up to 40% have been reported in the literature, which leads to reoperation, less favorable cosmetic outcome, higher physical and psychological burden for the patients, and increased costs [2]. Even after re-excision, residual disease is detected at the surgical margins in up to 17% of the cases, constituting a major risk for local recurrence and metastases [3,4]. Methods of tumor boundary assessment vary from traditional tactile information, wire-guided localization, and analysis of frozen biopsies to advanced imaging technologies such as intraoperative positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and optical coherence tomography [2,5]. All these modalities have their limitations and none has yet proved to outperform the others. Targeted fluorescence image-guided surgery (FIGS) is a novel technique which aims to find a solution for this fundamental problem of oncological surgery. \n\nFIGS relies on intraoperative visualization of tumor tissue by labeled tracers targeting tumor specific antigens. Although any overexpressed protein in tumor cells can be a potential target for FIGS, an ideal target should be abundantly present on the cell membrane of cancer cells in the majority of the tumors, but scarcely present in adjacent normal tissue [6,7]. Various tumor antigens have been documented in the literature as possible targets for FIGS, including a relatively high number of tyrosine kinase receptors like EGFR and cMet [6]. Regarding breast cancer, targeted FIGS seems to be particularly focused on Her2 and VEGF as tumor antigens, using established therapeutic monoclonal antibodies against these targets [8]. Considering that only a minority of breast cancers are Her2 positive and that VEGF is associated with angiogenic endothelial cells rather than with malignant cancer cells, there seems room for more specific targets for imaging of breast cancer.",

            "text": "Cancer accounts for nearly 1 in every 7 deaths worldwide, claiming more lives than HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria combined [1]. It has been projected that by 2030 the global burden of cancer will grow to 21.7 million new cancer cases and 13 million cancer deaths worldwide due to growing and aging populations, with more increases expected due to the adoption of behaviors and lifestyles associated with economic development and urbanization [1], a trend already observed in economically transitioning countries [2]. In the United states, cancer is the second leading cause of death, accounting for nearly 1 in every 4 deaths. It is the leading cause of death in 21 states and among adults aged 40 to 79 [3]. \n\nThere are several different modalities that are currently used to treat cancer, including surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormone therapy, immune therapy, and targeted therapy [1,2]. Most patients receive treatment using two or more modalities, often sequentially, in the course of managing their cancer. As noted in [4], \"cancer treatments using a single therapeutic agent often result in limited clinical outcomes due to tumor heterogeneity and drug resistance. Combination therapies using multiple modalities can synergistically elevate anti-cancer activity while lowering doses of each agent, hence, reducing side effects.\" Some examples include combining gene therapy and chemotherapy with nanotechnology [4]; using surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy for head and neck cancers [5], combining immunotherapy with the more traditional surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy [6]; treating glioblastomas with a combination of surgery, radiotherapy, and systemic therapy [7]; treating brain metastases using a combination of surgery, radiotherapy, and symptomatic care [8]; treating localized rectal cancer using a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and adjuvant cytotoxic therapy [9]; and chemoradiotherapy plus surgery for esophageal cancer [10]. \n\nUnfortunately, multi-modality treatment decisions in current practice rely predominantly on individual clinician's experiences, and therefore the optimality of such decisions is unclear.",

We integrated both the direct and indirect comparisons by employing a Bayesian NMA, remedying the insufficiency of traditional meta-analysis. We found that, among nine modalities, CCRT and CCRT plus adjuvant CT were likely to be the optimal strategies for LACC in terms of both 3-year OS and PFS. \n\nNeoadjuvant treatments have the potential to eradicate micrometastases and could reduce systemic failures, in addition to facilitating local control by surgical resection. Neoadjuvant treatments also increase radio-sensitivity and decrease the hypoxic cell fraction. A recent review did not find sufficient evidence that neoadjuvant treatments followed by surgery improved the survival of LACC when compared with patients who were treated with RT or CCRT alone (47). It also failed to distinguish the modality of neoadjuvant treatments, i.e., CT, RT and CCRT. In our NMA, a total of 18 randomized controlled trials about neoadjuvant treatments (i.e., neoadjuvant CT plus surgery, neoadjuvant CT plus CCRT, neoadjuvant RT plus surgery and neoadjuvant CCRT plus surgery) were covered. Still, none of the neoadjuvant treatment outcomes surpassed that of CCRT alone. \n\nIn contrast to previous meta-analysis (11), the risk reduction of death associated with neoadjuvant CT was not statistically significant in our NMA. The previous metaanalysis did not include 3 randomized controlled trials by Wen et al. (39), Li et al. (40), and Yang et al. (46). In addition, none of the previous meta-analyses compared neoadjuvant CT followed by surgery with CCRT, the standard treatment modality. There was only one head-to-head phase III clinical trial (29), in which Gupta et al. found it was no difference in OS between these two strategies; however, CCRT resulted in superior disease-free survival in stage IIB disease.",

            "text": "Recurrences have a strong tendency to occur at the surgical bed and are not uncommonly seen together with distant metastases. Several adjuvant treatment strategies have been explored, but there is as yet no clear role for any of them. The combination of surgery and chemotherapy has been associated with worse clinical outcomes when compared to surgery alone. Previous studies suggested that systemic treatments with anthracycline-based regimens, combinations of temozolomide and bevacizumab or other anti-angiogenic drugs in monotherapy, such as sorafenib, sunitinib, or pazopanib, could be effective in patients with locally advanced and metastatic stages, but their benefit in the adjuvant setting remains to be further explored [4,7]. \n\nThe efficacy of adjuvant RT has not yet been fully established. There are multiple singleinstitution studies demonstrating increased local control but without a consistent demonstration of improvement in survival outcomes [11]. Several radiation treatment modalities have been used, including 3D conformal RT, intensity-modulated radiotherapy, and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). The advantage of dose escalation (\u226550 Gy), taking into account the risks and benefits, has been emphasized in terms of local control. In a retrospective analysis, Kim et al. [12] reported that adjuvant RT prevented LR regardless of the degree of resection or histological grade. Patients were treated with doses of 50-60 Gy and no significant radiation-related complications were noted. In a more recent retrospective study, RT failed to improve OS after gross tumor removal, but the improvement in local control was independent of the type of resection. Patients received either daily fractionated doses of up to 54-66.6 Gy or SRS with 18-20 Gy, and a survival benefit was reported in those with subtotal resection or biopsy [11]. The patient reported here received primary surgery with apparent gross tumor removal. Postsurgical MRI could not rule out residual disease, but pathological analysis revealed noninvolved margins. However, due to the expected likelihood of LR of this disease, as well as the age and good performance status of the patient, adjuvant irradiation was planned.",

As mentioned above, RT might have superiority over RP on eliminating micro-metastases and ultimately resulted in better disease control. So these results might be combined to explain the improvement of CSS in patients treated with RT. Similar outcomes were also observed in subgroup analyses according to the T stage. Due to data limitations, we can only use ratios to separate two relatively high and low T stage groups. While we might infer that RT might bring better survival benefits than RP in patients with higher T stage. The inspiration for our clinicians was that RP might be less appropriate and RT might be the first choice for patients with high T stage or high GS.\n\nWith the development of treatment modalities, more patients with high-risk PCa can maintain a stable condition for a long term or even be cured. However, making an optimal treatment decision is not only pursuing maximal survival benefit but also a better health-related quality of life. Thus, the assessment of treatments on QoL is also critical for decision making. RP had better performance when considering QoL in the bowel domain, while RT was associated with better QoL in urinary and sexual domains. In clinical practice, younger patients with highrisk prostate cancer who have a greater need for retention of sexual and urinary function after treatment could be recommended with RT. Moreover, RP might be more suitable for patients who need a better bowel function.\n\nAlthough our research was the most up to date and we did a lot of subgroup analysis, this study still had some limitations. First, heterogeneity was relatively high due to inconsistent inclusion criteria and different treatment modalities. Second, because of the limited data, the population ratio was used to subdivide studies for analysis. Third, in some subgroups, the number of studies and patients is relatively small. Fourth, we failed to perform a meta-analysis on QoL and only presented the results of these studies. This area requires more research and data. Finally, some people included in the studies would inevitably be partially duplicated as the same database was used. Therefore, those results obtained in these subgroups cannot be strong evidence, but can only be used as a reference for interpreting the results.",

In populations similar to the one described herein patients suffering from stage III or IV OPSCC patients enrolled in S-CRT treatment protocols did have the highest survival outcome compared to other treatment modalities. S-CRT is associated with a 17-22% 5 year disease specific survival benefit compared to CRT or S-RT.\n\nThis analysis of a longitudinal prospectively collected cancer registry does provide valuable information regarding the treatment of OPSCC and provides a potential useful benchmark for evidence-based counseling of patients suffering from OPSCC. It is imperative that all health professionals involved in the treatment of OPSCC acknowledge that any retrospective review of survival data cannot show causal relationships between survival outcomes and treatment modalities, rather only associations can be examined. As noted in the treatment population, patients with advanced stage OPSCC treated with S-CRT were associated with statistically significant increases in disease specific survival rates at both 2 and 5 years. The more challenging task arising from this survival analysis is how to utilize this data to predict future survival outcomes. With the lack of randomized control trials available one cannot definitively state that S-CRT offers an improved survival rate compared to S-RT or CRT, however the best available evidence on the treatment population described here does show an association between triple modality therapy (S-CRT) and improved rates of survival. The data presented here does support our current practice of offering patients with advanced stage OPSCC aggressive surgical resection and reconstruction followed by adjuvant chemoradiation therapy as a possible treatment option providing excellent chances of disease free survival and raises questions on what treatment modalities provide patients with advanced OPSCC with the optimum chances of disease free survival.\n\nThe survival outcomes presented here does generate multiple questions that require further investigation including what role does HPV status play in the relationship between survival outcome and treatment modality as well as is the association between increased disease specific survival and treatment with S-CRT compared to CRT noted in other treatment cohorts. Both of these questions are currently being examined by our research group with the hopes of providing more information regarding the optimum treatment of advanced OPSCC.",

Interventional oncology is becoming the fourth pillar of cancer care besides the classic trio of medical oncology, surgery and radiation oncology. The data presented above demonstrates only modest improvement in overall survival of patients with LAPC and patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer, but still this is a significant step forward in the treatment of a disease which has dismal prognosis. In the current medical practice these new minimally invasive treatments are used mostly as salvage therapies, when a patient has no other option. This approach introduces a selection bias into the studies and may mask the real potential of these novel treatment modalities. Despite the selection bias, they have one obvious advantage, the low mortality and morbidity rates of image guided-procedures compared to surgery,   radiation therapy and even to chemotherapy. Interventional oncology has many tools in its armamentarium to manage patients with primary and secondary pancreatic cancer; however, most of the new treatment options are in the experimental phase and only performed by large-volume centers. We are in an era of a paradigm shift from conventional oncology to immunooncology which could promote the concurrent use of ablative technologies together with immune therapies[45, [101][102][103][104]. It has been found that ablation of solid tumors triggers a tumor-specific immune response which can be beneficial in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors or other immune modulator agents. Future studies are needed to define the specific role of interventional oncology in every stages of pancreatic cancer with special attention on the immunological effect of ablative techniques.",

Two well-known prospective randomized trials have tried to compare the adjuvant treatment efficacy between single modality and combined modality in stage III EC patients (7, 24). However, the PORTEC-3 trial failed to draw an exclusive conclusion on whether combined modality was better than single modality in stage IIIC EC patients, and the GOG-258 trial appeared to conflict with some real-world reports where the single modality seemed to be inferior to the combined modality (8-10). Therefore, a tailored adjuvant treatment on the basis of the characteristics of each individual was required. \n\nIn the process of selecting the predictors, the role of histology type drew much of our attention, which showed a significant impact on overall survival in the univariate analysis (P < 0.001) but did not hold its position in the multivariate analysis (P = 0.287). Despite the consensus that type II EC was a more aggressive disease than type I EC (25), this index indeed loses the ability to differentiate the survival outcomes in stage IIIC EC patients with ART alone. The same phenomenon was also observed by previous investigators who found that stage IIIC EC patients with the same grade would have an equivalent survival probability from different treatment modalities despite the histology type (8,9), which implied that grade clearly had a much bigger role to play compared with histology type in differentiating the survival outcomes for stage IIIC EC patients. Besides this, grade had the greatest length in our nomogram (Figure 1), indicating the strongest prediction ability, which further proved that the predictive power of histology type would be diminished when it was adjusted together with the grade.",

Moreover, although perioperative CRT or CT has been proved to be effective in rectal cancer, in real clinical circumstance, there are still a part of patients with locally advanced rectal cancer undergoing surgery alone. According to a large-scale populationbased study through the California Cancer Registry, there were still 33% and 18.6% of patients with stage II and stage III rectal cancer undergoing surgery alone from the year 1994 to 2008 [23]. Similarly, 57.4% and 13.0% of patients with stage II and stage III rectal cancer underwent surgery alone in our study. Currently, we are lacking of studies in defining characteristics of patients who  have good outcomes without neoadjuvant therapy, particularly with surgery alone. Our nomogram provides a helpful tool for identifying patients with good outcomes if they were preoperatively under-staged and underwent surgery first. Meanwhile, as preoperative CRT contributed small improvements in overall survival and distant metastases, our study provided helpful tools and comparable dataset for predicting patients' distant control and overall survival in locally advanced rectal cancer with multiple treatment modalities. The goal of our study is to develop monograms to predict overall survival and distant metastases for patients without preoperative treatment. To our knowledge, using the 7 th edition of AJCC staging system was the first predicting model for OS and distant control in rectal cancer (Figure 2), especially in Asian patients who were less represented in the AJCC stage system. Similar survival differences among different AJCC stage categories were observed in our patient cohort, as compared with Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) population-based data [24]. Postoperative T stage and N stage were still most significant factors to predict OS and DM rates. However, from the predicted outcomes based on our nomograms, heterogeneities in the risk of death and distant metastases still largely existed within each sub-category stage from stage IIA to stage IIIC.

In our study, we also excluded patients with stage IV disease to compare the different treatment modalities on overall survival of patients with locoregional ESCC. Patients were stratified according to clinical stage. We found that esophagectomy alone was associated with better overall survival than definitive CRT in patients with clinical stage I disease. Definitive CRT in patients with stage II and stage III ESCC was associated with similar survival compared with other treatment modalities Studies have shown that definitive CRT results in complete pathologic response in 25% to 40.4% of cases, [20][21][22][23][24][25] which implies that CRT alone is sufficient for select patients with esophageal cancer. 7][28] Therefore, the potential survival benefit of surgery is counterbalanced by its surgical risk. In Taiwan, almost half of patients (n \u00bc 2848, 45.9%) with locoregional ESCC received definitive CRT during the period 2008 to 2012. We found that for patients with stage I disease esophagectomy alone resulted in better overall survival than definitive CRT (P \u00bc 0.029). However, for patients with stage III ESCC, surgery alone was associated with significantly poorer overall survival than other treatments. For patients with stage II disease, there was no significant difference in overall survival among the major different treatment modalities.

            "text": "Surgical treatment and endoscopic treatment represent two distinct modalities in the management of rectal cancer, each with its own set of advantages and considerations. Surgical treatment, particularly TME, is widely regarded as the standard approach due to its ability to achieve complete tumor resection and excision of surrounding tissues, resulting in favorable oncological outcomes. However, complete tumor resection is also achieved by endoscopic treatment and other techniques. \n\nComparing surgical treatment and transanal resection, both modalities fall within the surgical spectrum for rectal cancer management. Transanal resection techniques, such as transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM), offer a minimally invasive alternative specifically suited for selected early-stage rectal cancers. However, transanal resection may have limitations in terms of tumor size and lymph node assessment compared to surgical treatment [12]. \n\nIn the context of endoscopic treatment versus transanal resection, both techniques offer minimally invasive approaches for rectal cancer management. Endoscopic treatment, including TME, is appropriate for selected cases of early-stage rectal cancer, enabling the removal of localized tumors without resorting to open surgery. On the other hand, transanal resection techniques, such as TEM, are better suited for slightly larger tumors or those necessitating full-thickness excision. The choice between endoscopic treatment and transanal resection depends on tumor characteristics, size, and location [12]. \n\nIn addition, while comparing transanal resection, each has its advantages and considerations. Transanal resection, such as TEM or TAMIS (Transanal Minimally Invasive Surgery), offers the potential for organ preservation and shorter recovery time compared to more extensive surgical procedures [27]. Radiotherapy, particularly when combined with chemotherapy, is often employed in locally advanced cases to improve local control and increase the chances of successful surgical resection [28]. The decision between transanal resection and radiotherapy depends on tumor stage, location, patient preferences, and the expertise available in the healthcare system. Table 1. provides a summary of the main oncological outcomes from studies evaluating surgical, endoscopic, and radiotherapy modalities of treatment.",

            "text": "Simple Summary Laryngeal cancer is a prevalent head and neck malignancy, with poor prognosis and low survival rates for patients with advanced disease. The recurrence rate for advanced laryngeal cancer is between 25 and 50%. In order to improve surgical resection of laryngeal cancer and reduce local recurrence rates, various intraoperative optical imaging techniques have been investigated. In this systematic review we identify these technologies, evaluating the current state and future directions of optical imaging for this indication. Evidently, the investigated imaging modalities are generally unsuitable for deep margin assessment, and, therefore, inadequate to guide resection in advanced laryngeal disease. We discuss two optical imaging techniques that can overcome these limitations and suggest how they can be used to achieve adequate margins in laryngeal cancer at all stages. Abstract Laryngeal cancer is a prevalent head and neck malignancy, with poor prognosis and low survival rates for patients with advanced disease. Treatment consists of unimodal therapy through surgery or radiotherapy in early staged tumors, while advanced stage tumors are generally treated with multimodal chemoradiotherapy or (total) laryngectomy followed by radiotherapy. Still, the recurrence rate for advanced laryngeal cancer is between 25 and 50%. In order to improve surgical resection of laryngeal cancer and reduce local recurrence rates, various intraoperative optical imaging techniques have been investigated. In this systematic review, we identify these technologies, evaluating the current state and future directions of optical imaging for this indication. Narrow-band imaging (NBI) and autofluorescence (AF) are established tools for early detection of laryngeal cancer. Nonetheless, their intraoperative utility is limited by an intrinsic inability to image beyond the (sub-)mucosa. Likewise, contact endoscopy (CE) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) are technically cumbersome and only useful for mucosal margin assessment. Research on fluorescence imaging (FLI) for this application is sparse, dealing solely with nonspecific fluorescent agents. Evidently, the imaging modalities that have been investigated thus far are generally unsuitable for deep margin assessment. We discuss two optical imaging techniques that can overcome these limitations and suggest how they can be",

            "text": "Breast cancer management is a multifaceted endeavor, relying on five primary treatment modalities: surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, and targeted therapy [191]. The customization of each patient's treatment plan hinges primarily on the disease stage and the molecular profile [192]. In this era of personalized medicine, intricate patient-specific details play a pivotal role. These encompass decisions regarding which treatment line is most suitable, the timing of interventions, and the sequence of these therapeutic approaches. The administration of these treatment modalities within specialized, high-volume breast cancer centers, guided by multidisciplinary team assessments, is no longer an extravagance but a determinant of patients' oncological outcomes and their overall quality of life [192]. Surgery encompasses both breast and axillary procedures. Within breast surgery, there are two primary categories: breast-conserving surgery and mastectomy, the latter of which may or may not involve reconstruction. Breast-conserving surgery represents the gold standard for early-stage breast cancer [193]. Mastectomy, on the other hand, remains a vital alternative for those ineligible for breast conservation, such as the patients with locally advanced tumors at the time of surgery, patients unsuitable for breast irradiation, individuals with multicentric tumors that cannot be sufficiently removed through oncological resection, and those who opt against breast conservation [192][193][194][195][196]. For patients undergoing mastectomy, breast reconstruction surgeries, whether involving synthetic or autologous implants, offer crucial options [197][198][199]. Axillary surgery encompasses procedures such as axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SNB). SNB has become the standard approach for node-negative breast cancer and selected cases of node-positive breast cancer. However, axillary dissection remains necessary for patients with multiple metastatic axillary lymph nodes at the time of surgery, as well as for individuals who are not suitable candidates or have experienced failed sentinel lymph node localization [160,[200][201][202][203].",

            "text": "Approximately 15-20% of patients with pancreatic cancer present with resectable disease [27]. We found the percentage of patients with EOPC presenting with localized-staged disease (a loose correlate for resectable disease) was less than 15% from 2004-2012, and from 2013-2016, this percentage increased over time to a peak of 25.9%. Several single-center reviews and one population-based registry review of patients with EOPC have shown that younger patients were more likely to present with unresectable disease [28][29][30][31]. \n\nThe National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines for pancreatic adenocarcinoma offer evidence-based recommendations for treating pancreatic cancer. For localized and regional-stage disease, the most frequently utilized therapies in our study were not the modalities of therapies as recommended by standard treatment guidelines, which, in general, are regimens of surgery and chemotherapy for localized and regionalstage disease. Additionally, our analysis showed surgery alone (without chemotherapy) was overwhelmingly used for localized-stage disease. Chemotherapy, chemotherapy with radiation, and primary surgery alone were the most utilized therapies for regional-stage disease. One explanation for the difference from standard treatment guidelines may be that SEER staging (as described above) differs from the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system used in clinical practice. A caveat to the interpretation of the treatment pattern for regional-stage disease is that treatment, as recommended by NCCN, differs between borderline-resectable disease (regimens primarily consisting of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgery) and locally advanced disease (regimens consisting of chemotherapy or chemoradiation and surgery, if appropriate). In our analysis, patients with EOPC underwent more surgery than 50-69 y/o patients and received radiation, chemotherapy, and surgery more frequently than >70 y/o patients (Appendix A Table A1). Given the higher proportion of distant-stage diagnoses in the EOPC population, where NCCN generally recommends chemotherapy alone, the higher treatment rates are notable. \n\nOther studies have also shown that patients with EOPC are treated differently than older patients.",

Also chemotherapy is essential, and serious postoperative complications or rapid disease progression may preclude completion of multimodal treatment. The sequence of treatment interventions has therefore become an important concern, and numerous ongoing randomized controlled trials compare clinical outcome after upfront surgery and neoadjuvant treatment with subsequent resection. In previous years, borderline resectable and locally advanced pancreatic cancer was most often considered unresectable. More effective chemotherapy together with the latest improvements in surgical expertise has resulted in extended operations, pushing the borders of resectability. Multivisceral resections with or without resection of major mesenteric vessels are now performed in numerous patients, resulting in better outcome, recorded as overall survival and/or patient reported outcome. But postoperative morbidity increases concurrently, and clinical benefit must be carefully evaluated against risk of potential harm, associated with new comprehensive multimodal treatment sequences. Even though cost/utility analyses are deficient, extended surgery has resulted in significantly longer and better life for many patients with no other treatment alternative. Improved selection of patients to surgery and/or chemotherapy will in the near future be possible, based on better tumor biology insight. Clinically available biomarkers enabling personalized treatment are forthcoming, but these options are still limited. The importance of surgical resection for each patient\u2019s prognosis is presently increasing, justifying sustained expansion of the surgical treatment modality.",

            "text": "Currently, we still do not have a robust technique or combination of modalities that provides accurate intra-operative staging of PDAC, particularly the localisation of metastatic LNs and extra-pancreatic pathology. Several intra-operative techniques have been investigated for these purposes, and tumour-specific fluorescence-guided surgery appears to be a promising tool in diagnosing and treating PDAC. This is tackling a critical issue in PDAC where early recurrence occurs despite supposed R0 resections. Although FGS harnesses a lot of potential, further research is needed to fully understand the potential applications and benefits of fluorescence imaging for pancreatic cancer surgery. Ultimately, tumour-specific FGS combined with other diagnostic and therapeutic modalities could improve outcomes for patients with PDAC. Given the rapid advancements in clinical artificial intelligence (AI) technologies such as radiomics, pathomics, genomics, and surgomics, new opportunities are likely to emerge, transforming clinical pathways in pancreatic cancer surgery [108]. The successful integration, in the future, of AI-driven machine learning algorithms and FGS in operating theatres holds the potential for a paradigm shift. These innovations could assist surgeons in real-time by precisely analysing the extent of the tumour as well as pertinent anatomical features during surgery.",

The choice of treatment largely depends on the site and stage of the disease and on the overall health status of the patient. Early stages of intraoral cancers are likely to be cured by surgery or radiation therapy. The election of the type of treatment is determined by the anticipated functional and cosmetic results and by the availability of the particular expertise required from the surgeon or radiation therapist for each patient. Advanced tumors (stages III and IV) are generally treated by surgery, followed by radiation therapy.\n\nThe treatment for head and neck cancers, especially those involving the oral cavity, has changed in the last 10-20 years. It is now widely accepted that for advanced OC tumors, surgery combined with radiation therapy has a better outcome than if only one of those modalities is used. Although the impact of neo-adjuvant chemoradiation may increase survival, it may also increase morbidity considerably.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that current advent of state-of-the-art technology applied to cancer treatments has significantly improved the quality of life of OC patients. However, there are only few data as to the length of survival in relation to new devices such as gamma rays, electrons, protons and atomic nuclei, tridimensional (3DR), stereotactic, Modulated Intensity Radiotherapy (MIR) and Image-Guided Radiation Therapy (IGRT). The new technology allows the professional to better adjust radiation to the tumor, thus diminishing the damage inflicted to the surrounding healthy tissues, especially major salivary glands and maxillaries. Brachytheraphy is a still used resource; it requires the isolation of the radiated patient and it should be carried out by highly experienced professionals.\n\nIn spite of all the above mentioned innovations, the occurrence of complications is high, which would inevitably delay the standard therapeutic protocols. This fact, in turn, would make patients prone to recurrence or to metastases.",

Zenga et al. 20 also showed that primary surgical treatment might be associated with improved outcomes in patients with T4 OPSCC compared to non-surgical treatments. The systematic review of Yeh et al. 21 comparing surgery versus RT for the management of OPSCC reports that surgery has similar survival outcomes. Still, functional outcomes may be superior when compared to non-surgical therapy. However, the authors highlighted that differences in patient populations could explain these findings. Surgery studies tended to have fewer advanced tumors and cervical metastasis than non-surgical series. Moreover, surgery patients are usually carefully selected because their tumors were thoroughly evaluated for resectability with clear margins. Finally, the authors also suggested that some studies may have publication bias since some institutions might refrain from publishing their outcomes if not according to the published data in the literature. 21 hus, there is a paucity of prospective RCT comparing a primary surgical versus primary RT approach for T1/T2 cancers, and T3/T4 ones. 11 ORATOR 22 is the only RCT published that compared patients with T1---T2 N0-N2 (LN \u2264 4 cm) treated with primary RT versus those treated with transoral surgery and showed that RT arm had superior swallowingrelated QOL scores one year after treatment. However, the difference became less pronounced at a long-term followup. 22 Despite the efforts to present the first RCT to compare transoral surgery versus primary RT for the treatment of OPSCC, there are some limitations that we have to consider. The number of patients is 34; only ten were treated with surgery alone, while 16 received dual modality therapy, and eight received triple modality therapy. Moreover, the study included only patients with T1---T2 N0---N2, which is not the reality of some populations. 5,6 According to our database, 86.3% of patients of OPSCC were diagnosed at an advanced stage.",

            "text": "Hypopharyngeal cancer is usually diagnosed at an advanced stage and is associated with a high risk of recurrence and poor survival rates. Although they differ greatly in terms of prognosis, hypopharyngeal cancers are usually treated together with laryngeal cancers in clinical trials. Therefore, there are very few studies that focus specifically on patients with hypopharyngeal carcinoma. As a result, the therapeutic management of these patients is highly debated, and their clinical outcomes are poorly reported. The aim of this review is therefore to discuss the current therapeutic options in patients with hypopharyngeal carcinoma and their oncologic and functional outcomes. Patients with early-stage tumors can be treated either by conservative surgery (including transoral robot-assisted surgery) or by RT alone. However, most patients are diagnosed with locally advanced tumors that cannot be treated surgically without total laryngectomy. In this situation, the critical issue is to select the patients eligible for a larynx preservation therapeutic program. However, radical surgery with total laryngectomy still plays an important role in the management of patients with hypopharyngeal carcinoma, either as the primary treatment modality (T4 resectable primary tumor, contraindication to larynx preservation therapies) or, more commonly, as salvage treatment.",

            "text": "Both surgery and radiotherapy (RT) (external or brachytherapy) provide similar locoregional control and survival outcomes, but they have not been compared in randomized trials [4,5]. The choice of treatment modality depends on the functional outcome, the patient's wishes, the possibility of an adequate follow-up, the patient's general condition, and the likelihood of developing a second primary tumour (e.g., younger smoking patients use the surgical option not to jeopardize further treatment).\n\nCurative surgery is the preferred option for cancer of the oral cavity and involves resection of tumour with an appropriate safety margin and subsequent reconstruction [II, B]. Elective neck dissection offers improved overall and disease-free survival compared with therapeutic neck dissection [I, A] [6]. Sentinel node lymph node biopsy may be indicated for small cancers to avoid morbidity [II, B] [7].\n\nOropharyngeal carcinoma should ideally be treated with single-modality therapy, either primary surgery or RT. Radical RT is a good option (a total dose equivalent of 70 Gy in 35 fractions is used) [II, B]. Prophylactic RT should be given to the ipsilateral cervical lymph nodes for lateralized tumours and to both sides of the neck for nonlateralised tumours [II, B]. Surgery should usually be carried out transorally, either by transoral laser microsurgery (TLM) or transoral robotic surgery (TORS). Oncologic results after transoral resection of the oropharynx appear to be comparable to open surgery [II, B] [8], which is associated with increased morbidity and treatment complications. Patients having surgery to the primary should also undergo ipsilateral selective neck dissection. Dissection of the contralateral neck may also be considered in tumours arising at or very near the midline [II, B].\n\nRadiotherapy or TLM are the two most commonly used treatment modalities in early laryngeal cancer [II, B]. Individual treatment selection depends on patient and tumour factors and local expertise. Single-modality treatment is sufficient and combining surgery",

            "text": "The oligometastatic paradigm hypothesizes that patients with a limited burden of metastases may achieve long-term disease control, survival benefit, or even cure, if the sites of disease can be removed. Although surgery was historically the primary modality used to remove metastases, newer and less-invasive modalities are now available, including stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) and image-guided ablations (4). Therapies are called minimally invasive if the success of the treatment is achieved in a way that is particularly gentle on the patient. The minimally invasive character of these interventions is often reflected in a non penetrative, or less invasive access route, so that many of these interventions can be performed on an outpatient basis or with a significantly reduced hospital stay. Instead of a large incision, at best punctures are required to target and destroy the respective lesion. In cancer therapy, a large number of interventions can already be carried out minimally invasively -unfortunately, experience shows that image-guided MIT are used far too rarely. The most common reason is that MIT are still rarely offered in the oncological therapy routine. Possible reasons for this may be due to the complexity of these therapies, which requires a particular specialization of the interventionalists, on the other hand also a close co-operation of the disciplines involved. In addition to the obvious advantages for the patients, these procedures present new challenges for the treating physician -one can neither directly see nor touch the tumor focus to be treated. Due to the limited exposure of the surgical site or the lack of manual palpation, important information is missing, which must be compensated by exact pretherapeutic planning. Radiologists, radiation therapists and nuclear medicine specialists are traditionally familiar with exactly this type of image-based diagnostics and image-guided therapy, i.e. with the creation of a \"virtual\" site. The core of this planning is an extremely precise imaging with recording of the anatomical, pathological and ideally also functional conditions -practically the creation of a virtual environment that is true to the millimeter. Modern imaging is required for therapy planning, as well as for controlling the intervention itself, documenting the results directly after treatment and, of course, for monitoring the progress of the treatment.",

            "text": ", SRS is now widely used for patients with four or fewer brain lesions in recent years due to improved cognitive outcomes and more favorable quality of life [13,15]. ere is evidence that even for patients with up to ten brain metastases, SRS might be appropriate [16]. Moreover, new techniques like HyperArc and Multiple Brain Mets are able to facilitate the use of SRS to treat multiple brain metastases in a single or few sessions [17]. WBRT is often considered for patients with multiple metastases or short life expectancy. Due to the lack of a general consensus on the optimal treatment of BM from digestive cancers, the treatment strategy remains often tailored in a multidisciplinary context. Currently, most previous studies are retrospective single-center analysis of clinical characteristics, predictive factors, and prognostic factors in sample size limited cohorts, and very few reports have evaluated the outcomes of various treatment modalities. However, we are still confused to make choice on the optimal treatment strategy. e aim of the present study was to retrospectively analyze the clinical features of 270 patients with BM from 68257 digestive cancers, compare the outcomes of various treatment modalities, and identify prognostic factors to guide clinicians to choose optimal treatment for patients with BM from digestive cancers. Because there were background intergroup differences and a large discrepancy in the number of patients in different groups, propensity score matching was conducted. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first retrospective study which conducted propensity score matching and evaluated the outcomes of various treatment modalities for BM from digestive cancers. It also presents the largest number of patients with BM from digestive cancers analyzation to date.",

            "text": "Patients with squamous cell carcinoma can be cured with a primary CRT [14]. By contrast, adenocarcinoma, the most prevalent type with the highest incidence in the United States, requires surgical resection as part of any curative attempt. Multimodality treatment regimen with inclusion of systemic chemotherapy control to prevent the development of distant micrometastatic disease and enhance local radiation effects. One validation of this approach was provided by the results of the intergroup study carried out by Tepper and colleagues [11]. In this study, which failed to accrue to goals, a total of 57 patients were randomized to either pre-operative CRT with cisplatin and 5-FU or surgery alone. The patients treated with the tri-modality approach had a statistically significant improvement in survival. Furthermore, this study again showed that pCR to neoadjuvant CRT is associated with significantly improved survival. In the CROSS trial 368 patients were randomized to either pre-operative CRT with carboplatin and paclitaxel or surgery alone. The median overall survival for patients with SCC of esophagus was 81.6 months (95% CI 47.2-116.0) months in the chemoradiotherapy plus surgery group vs 21.1 months (95% CI 15.4-26.7) in the surgery group (hazard ratio, 0.48; 95% confidence interval, 0.28 to 0.83; P=0.008). Median overall survival in patients with adenocarcnioma was 43 . 2 months (24 . 9-61 . 4) in the neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy plus surgery group and 27 . 1 months (13 . 0-41 . 2) in the surgery alone group (HR 0 . 73 [95% CI 0 . 55-0 . 98]; log-rank p=0 . 038) [15]. The work presented here aimed to further refine the relationship between pathologic stage and survival, with the added approach of correlating each pathologic stage with outcome. As shown in Figure 3, there was a statistically significant relationship between post-surgical stage and overall survival.",

The increased awareness of those factors resulted in a 2.4% annual decrease in the incidence of laryngeal cancer in the last decade (3). However, about 40% of the cases are still diagnosed in advanced stages III and IV (Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) (4), resulting in a poor 5-year overall survival (OS) below 50% (3, 5) with a slight improvement over the last 10 year (6). It is preferred to choose an optimal treatment strategy delivering the maximal disease-free survival, while preserving the larynx and its function if possible.\n\nIn the last decades, both primary radiotherapy (RT) and primary surgery for early UICC stage I-II squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx (LSCC) were well established as acceptable modalities providing excellent oncological outcome and quality of life (7-11). On the other hand, advanced UICC stage III-IV LSCC with or without regional lymph node metastasis resembles a heterogeneous group with a complex management, where the optimal treatment strategy remains unclear (6, 12, 13) For example, the NCCN guidelines recommends upfront surgery for T4a, and there is more controversy for T3 tumors population. Still, there is a lack of modern phase III trials comparing different treatment modalities for advanced LSCC.\n\nThe aim of this single institution retrospective chart review is to report the oncologic outcome of stage III-IVB patients (T3-T4a N1-N3b) treated with curatively intended primary non-surgical and surgical treatment modalities and compare it to published literature.",

However, few studies have shown no difference in survival between combined or single adjuvant treatment modalities (Haight et al., 2023 Aug). The present study showed a significant improvement in overall survival for those who received combined chemotherapy (3-4 cycles) + Pelvic Radiation compared to patients who received only chemotherapy. \n\nTo our knowledge, this is the first Indian study to provide detailed management of Stage IVB disease and reclassify these patients according to the new FIGO 2023 staging system. This study also showed the outcomes of different treatment modalities and adjuvant treatments. The importance of segregating patients with pelvic or abdomen-confined diseases from extra-abdominal metastasis was also highlighted. This study had limitations due to its small cohort size, as advanced-stage endometrial cancer patients are rare. There was a lack of consistency in the imaging techniques used, and only a minority of patients underwent PET CT scans, potentially resulting in missed distant metastases. Moreover, distinguishing between Stage IIIC and Stage IIIB was not feasible because nodal staging was not conducted for advanced disease. Unfortunately, we couldn't perform a multivariate analysis for certain significant factors affecting survival outcomes because some categories required a larger sample size to ensure the study's validity. Therefore, conducting a multivariate analysis with a limited sample size would have yielded less meaningful results.",

            "text": "The introduction of the embryologically based concept of total mesorectal excision (TME) by Heald more than 30 years ago has led to dramatic improvements in the local recurrence rates of patients with rectal cancer [1,2]. \n\nDespite continuous advances in multimodal treatment with refinements in imaging modalities and neoadjuvant therapy protocols (i.e., total neoadjuvant therapy), surgery still plays a significant role in being the strongest predictor of local recurrence (LR), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) [3]. \n\nLaparoscopic surgery has gained popularity during the last decades in treating rectal cancer. Three randomized controlled laparoscopic versus open rectal resection trials have demonstrated similar rates of circumferential resection margin (CRM) involvement, LR, DFS, and OS [4][5][6][7]. Nevertheless, the Australian Laparoscopic Cancer of the Rectum (ALACART) and the Effect of Laparoscopic-Assisted Resection vs. Open Resection of Stage II or III Rectal Cancer on Pathologic Outcomes (ACOSOG) trials have questioned the noninferiority of laparoscopy when compared to open surgery in rectal cancer treatment [8,9]. \n\nThe technical limitations of straight laparoscopic instruments in deep narrow spaces such as the pelvis, make laparoscopic TME a challenging procedure with a steep learning curve and a consistent conversion rate to open surgery. Therefore, efforts towards the optimization of minimally invasive surgical treatment of rectal cancer are needed. Robotic surgery may offer significant advantages thanks to its technological features. The wristed instruments may allow correct triangulation, traction, and counter traction even deep in the pelvis for a finer dissection and optimal tissue handling with a stable operative field [10,11]. These technical advantages have led other specialties to consider robotic surgery the mainstream approach for oncological pelvic surgery. \n\nSeveral meta-analyses have highlighted the potential benefits of robotic surgery but have been criticized because of the low quality of the included studies.",

            "text": "Currently, both RT and RP are first-line treatments for clinically high-risk PCa patients, and the optimal treatment remains a debate. One small RCT has compared the survival outcomes for patients with T2b-3N0M0 PCa treated with surgery or radiotherapy [21]. Except for 2 reviews and meta-analysis focused on localized PCa [43,44], there were two meta-analyses about highrisk prostate cancer published in 2014 and 2015 [17,18], while limited information was provided due to inappropriate statistical methods and rough analyses. Petrelli and colleagues reported a meta-analysis comparing the efficacy of RP and RT in patients with high-risk PCa and demonstrated the superiority of RP [17]. However, Petrelli and colleagues used odds ratios to present the comparison results, which inevitably ignored the time-toevent outcomes. More recently, a meta-analysis was conducted by Lei and colleagues; they reported that RP brought lower CSM than RT [18], while this metaanalysis was conducted only based on 3 studies. It was particularly noteworthy that none of these previous meta-analyses did a subgroup analysis according to T stage, GS, or RT types, and thus, no detailed data were available for clinicians to optimize treatment strategies.\n\nIn the present study, the most up-to-date data were comprehensively analyzed and we found better survival outcomes for patients treated with RP compared to those who received RT. However, RT was associated with better disease control. Subgroup analyses furtherly showed that similar or even better survival outcomes were associated with RT in patients with high GS, high T stage, or received EBRT + BT.\n\nThe better disease control for patients treated with RT was likely due to the wider scope of radiotherapy than that of surgery, which made it possible to eliminate micrometastases outside the prostate and resulted in improved BRFS and MFS. Moreover, adjuvant ADT in addition to RT could further help control the micro-metastases and delay biochemical relapse. However, the improvement of BRFS and MFS by RT did not convert into superior survival benefit compared to RP. Several potential reasons might explain this phenomenon. First, patients treated with RT were older and harbored more adverse clinicopathological features than those with RP",

            "text": "Curative treatment for BOT SCC at our institution has undergone several major paradigm shifts in the last three decades. During the 1980s to 1990s, a nonsurgical approach of EBRT + IB with planned neck dissection was the primary treatment modality for locoregional advanced disease. Subsequently, in the early 2000s, with randomized control trials demonstrating significant improvements in LC and survival with concurrent chemotherapy [13,14], our institution established chemoRT as the standard firstline therapy for patients with advanced BOT SCC [18]. In accordance with published results, our cohort of definitive chemoRT patients had significantly improved LRC and  OS compared to definitive RT patients. The addition of chemotherapy resulted in a benefit of 17% in LRC that translated into survival advantage. Surgery with postoperative RT had 5-year LRC, DFS, and OS rates of 84%, 82%, and 62%. Karatzanis et al. [19]. also reported 5-year LC, disease-specific survival (DSS), and OS rates of 86%, 63%, and 47% with primary surgery plus postoperative RT. There was no significant difference in treatment outcomes of surgery plus postoperative RT versus definitive chemoRT, although the postoperative RT group appeared numerically better in terms of LC, LRC, and DFS. However, there were significantly fewer T3/T4 tumors in the surgery plus postoperative RT cohort compared to the primary RT cohort. In our experience, combined modality approaches generally provide high local RC rates but are associated with suboptimal functional outcomes. Despite excellent disease control, surgery plus postoperative RT was not the treatment modality used for most advanced cancers at our institution due to concerns with impaired speech and swallowing outcomes. We have favored concurrent chemoRT, which provides near equivalent cure rates as surgery, but with less severe toxicity, improved organ function preservation, and improved quality of life [1,11,12,[20][21][22].\n\nIn terms of RT technique, our preferred choice for decades had been combination EBRT with interstitial brachytherapy boost [9]. In our experience using EBRT + IB for treatment of stage III/IV patients, the 5-year LC, DFS, and OS",

In addition, amputation was indicated to be higher among patients with 'undifferentiated' grade of osteosarcoma. In the comparison of surgery types among patients with the same stage or grade of osteosarcoma, results of survival outcome based on surgery type were almost identical. The results of the present study indicated that for types of surgery the best to worst survival outcomes were as follows: Local excision, radical excision, amputation and no surgery.

            "text": "Radical treatment of BM is challenging and often requires an integrated multidisciplinary approach [18][19][20][21]. Surgery and RT have traditionally been the treatment of choice in such a clinical scenario. However, due to patients' pre-existing comorbidities and the fact that surgery often delays systemic treatment, the opportunities of radical surgery have often been narrow [20]. Nowadays, radical surgery is mainly reserved to patients with good life expectancy and PS, very limited burden of systemic disease, and favorable tumor histotype (e.g. thyroid or kidney cancer), especially when the BM is associated with a pathologic or an impending fracture. To achieve effective local tumor control, radical surgery is often combined with RT [22], of which the field of action has progressively increased in the past few years as a result of the introduction of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT); which offers high rate of local tumor control (around 90% at 1-year [23]) and better rates of pain management as compared to standard external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) [24]. Wang et al. reported on 166 mechanically stable, non-cord-compressing spinal BM originating from various primaries in 149 patients undergoing SBRT [25]. Their inclusion criteria was similar to those applied in the present study (e.g. oligometastatic disease, failure of previous conventional RT or surgery, residual tumor after surgery, medical inoperability, and refusal to undergo surgery); and similarly, their oncologic results were analogous to those obtained with percutaneous image-guided ablation in the present series: the rate of local tumor progression reported by Wang et al. is 28% (vs. 28.5% in the present series), resulting in 1-and 2year LPFS 80.5% and 72.4%, respectively (vs. 76.8% and 71.7%, respectively in the present series). \n\nCompared to RT [18], percutaneous image-guided locoregional therapies can achieve effective tumor destruction irrespective of the tumor histology, as confirmed by the similar LPFS rates obtained in the present series among all the different tumor histologies.",

            "text": "In recent years, the incidence of gastrointestinal cancer has remained high. Currently, surgical resection is still the most effective method for treating gastrointestinal cancer. Traditionally, radical surgery depends on open surgery. However, traditional open surgery inflicts great trauma and is associated with a slow recovery. Minimally invasive surgery, which aims to reduce postoperative complications and accelerate postoperative recovery, has been rapidly developed in the last two decades; it is increasingly used in the field of gastrointestinal surgery and widely used in early-stage gastrointestinal cancer. Nevertheless, many operations for gastrointestinal cancer treatment are still performed by open surgery. One reason for this may be the challenges of minimally invasive technology, especially when operating in narrow spaces, such as within the pelvis or near the upper edge of the pancreas. Moreover, some of the current literature has questioned oncologic outcomes after minimally invasive surgery for gastrointestinal cancer. Overall, the current evidence suggests that minimally invasive techniques are safe and feasible in gastrointestinal cancer surgery, but most of the studies published in this field are retrospective studies and casematched studies. Large-scale randomized prospective studies are needed to further support the application of minimally invasive surgery. In this review, we summarize several common minimally invasive methods used to treat gastrointestinal cancer and discuss the advances in the minimally invasive treatment of gastrointestinal cancer in detail.",

            "text": "Simple Summary Colorectal cancer is the fourth most common type of cancer globally. Approximately 20% of patients with colorectal cancer present with synchronous liver metastases, and up to 60% will develop metachronous metastases during the course of the disease. Although liver resection is currently considered the local treatment of choice for colorectal liver metastasis (CLM), less than one-third of patients are eligible for surgery at the time of diagnosis of CLM. Ablation is a well-established, less invasive, locoregional therapy for patients with small CLMs, which has shown favorable oncological outcomes in patients with unresectable CLMs, comparable to those in patients eligible for surgery. The increasing knowledge of factors affecting oncological outcomes has allowed selected patients with resectable small volume CLMs to be treated with thermal ablation with curative intent. The continuous technological evolutions in imaging and image guidance have contributed to this paradigm shift in CLM treatment. The importance of patient selection, patient factors, tumor factors, ablation techniques, and clinical applications is discussed in this article. Abstract Image-guided ablation can provide effective local tumor control in selected patients with CLM. A randomized controlled trial suggested that radiofrequency ablation combined with systemic chemotherapy resulted in a survival benefit for patients with unresectable CLM, compared to systemic chemotherapy alone. For small tumors, ablation with adequate margins can be considered as an alternative to resection. The improvement of ablation technologies can allow the treatment of tumors close to major vascular structures or bile ducts, on which the applicability of thermal ablation modalities is challenging. Several factors affect the outcomes of ablation, including but not limited to tumor size, number, location, minimal ablation margin, RAS mutation status, prior hepatectomy, and extrahepatic disease. Further understanding of the impact of tumor biology and advanced imaging guidance on overall patient outcomes might help to tailor its application, and improve outcomes of image-guided ablation.",

            "text": "Background: Non-image-guided forms of radiotherapy (external radiation therapy [XRT], including superficial radiation therapy [SRT]), have been used to treat non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) for over a century. More recently, image-guided superficial radiation therapy (IGSRT), which allows visualization of tumor configuration and depth throughout treatment, is being used to treat NMSC with high local control (LC) rate. Methods: Two recent studies report the results of IGSRT. Further, the American Society of Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) has published a comprehensive review of studies examining XRT/SRT outcomes of which four high-quality, recent, evidence-based, large (with more than 100 cases), United States (U.S.) based studies exist. Using information from these six studies, we employ logistic regression to compare basal cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and squamous cell carcinoma in situ (SCCIS) treatment outcomes between IGSRT and XRT/SRT. Findings: IGSRT local control (LC) was statistically superior to each of the four large non-image-guided radiotherapy studies individually, collectively, and stratified by histologic subtype. Interpretation: IGSRT LC is superior to non-image guided radiotherapy LC for the treatment of early-stage epithelial cancers. We propose that because lower recurrence rates result in less economic, social, and psychological burden on patients, IGSRT could be considered the preferred standard for the non-surgical radiotherapeutic treatment of early-stage NMSC with LC comparable to Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS).",

            "text": "C ancer is one of the leading causes of human death all over the world. Among general therapies, the surgical operation has been widely applied in treating cancer by physically removing malignant tumors. A successful resection is highly depended on the rapid and accurate localization of malignant tissues, especially for treatments of tiny foci and sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) 1 . More importantly, the physical diagnosis during oncologic surgery, such as palpation and visual inspection are strongly related to surgeons' experience that would eventually affect the outcome of surgery. Compared with the other conventional imaging modalities including X-ray, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ultrasound, the immune-positron emission tomography (Immuno-PET) offers a better preoperative diagnosis via tumor-specific imaging 2 . However, the lengthy acquisition time and ionizing radiation risk greatly restrict its intraoperative application 3 . A powerful image guidance would not only greatly promote the outcome of surgery but also increase the surgical efficiency via a precision operation (e.g., the certain SLNs biopsy & resection) instead of comprehensive surgery, such as whole lymph nodes excision.\n\nThe procedure of cancer surgery and outcomes could be potentially improved via fluorescence image-guided surgery (IGS) 4,5 . Since now, various fluorescence molecules have been systemically investigated as imaging probes for optically guided surgery, with high sensitivity, bio-compatibility, portability, and cost-effectively [6][7][8] . Among all, indocyanine green (ICG), as the most common dye could offer a desirable signal-to-background ratio and tissue-penetration depth, which has been widely employed in clinical applications 4,9,10 . Nevertheless, the ICGbased imaging is also subjected to the finite quantum yield 4 , short-term retention in tumor 11 , and nonspecific interaction with cells 12 . Besides, the special camera and systematic training required for NIR probes usage further restrain the promotion of ICG 13 . Therefore, versatile intraoperative imaging modalities with tumor-specific targeting are in urgent need.\n\nIn the comparison of enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect that passively facilitates the accumulation of agent in the tumor",

            "text": "Although some early studies recommended close monitoring and non-aggressive management of VCL, definitive treatment is now always recommended either by definitive surgery or definitive radiation therapy or a combination thereof with chemotherapy reserved for more advanced stages (1,11). In the current study looking at the Tis-T2 N0 M0 VCL, we identified several predictors of radiotherapy including treatment at a community center, no insurance, and T1-T2 tumor compared to Tis cancer. In this first propensity matched analysis of the two modalities of treatment of Tis-T2 N0 M0 VCL, we demonstrated superior survival outcomes for patients undergoing surgery with advanced age, presence of comorbidities, and lack of private insurance as predictors for poor outcome. \n\nThe identified differences in management may reflect differences in practice patterns such as radiation therapy being administered more commonly in community practice (12). The increased usage of radiation therapy, a strategy that is historically not recommended in this condition among patients with no insurance and therefore a vulnerable group, is concerning. The relationships between type of treatment and sociodemographic factors have been demonstrated previously, but it is difficult to ascertain the mechanisms based on the data available from the NCDB (12). It is also important to consider that insurance history is not a static factor, and therefore, further determination of this association would need prospective studies (13). \n\nHistorically, surgery has been the favored approach due to reports of anaplastic transformation and secondary metastasis associated with radiotherapy (4). While the improved outcomes with definitive surgery (5-year overall survival 87%) have been reported previously, we also noticed poorer outcomes in those treated with a combination of surgery and radiation (1,3,11). This is in contrast to other variants of laryngeal cancers, and the current study is limited in identifying the underlying mechanisms (14). Earlier studies have attributed this to anaplastic transformation of the cancer (rates as high as 11%) resulting in adverse outcomes (4). While subsequent studies failed to reproduce comparable results, they did demonstrate favorable surgical outcomes compared to patients treated with radiotherapy (3,5,6,(14)(15)(16).",

This study investigated the treatment modalities affecting survival of patients with ESCC in Taiwan.Data on 6202 patients who underwent treatment for locoregional esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma during 2008 to 2012 in Taiwan were collected from the Taiwan Cancer Registry. Patients were stratified by clinical stage. The major treatment approaches included definitive chemoradiotherapy, preoperative chemoradiation followed by esophagectomy, esophagectomy followed by adjuvant therapy, and esophagectomy alone. The impact of different treatment modalities on overall survival was analyzed.The majority of patients had stage III disease (n\u200a=\u200a4091; 65.96%), followed by stage II (n\u200a=\u200a1582, 25.51%) and stage I cancer (n\u200a=\u200a529, 8.53%). The 3-year overall survival rates were 60.65% for patients with stage I disease, 36.21% for those with stage II cancer, and 21.39% for patients with stage III carcinoma. Surgery alone was associated with significantly better overall survival than the other treatment modalities for patients with stage I disease (P\u200a=\u200a0.029) and was associated with significantly worse overall survival for patients with stage III cancer (P\u200a<\u200a0.001). There was no survival risk difference among the different treatment methods for patients with clinical stage II disease.Multimodality treatment is recommended for patients with stage II\u2013III esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma. Patients with clinical stage I disease can be treated with esophagectomy without preoperative therapy.",

Many centers have opted for organ preservation protocols using RT due to complications secondary to surgery. 31,35 However, postoperative adverse effects are mainly caused by access to the oropharynx through a transmandibular or transfacial approach. 32,33,50 Transoral Surgery (TORS) have been developed to reduce surgical morbidity, with 5-year survival rates similar to those of RT in patients with earlystage OPSCC. 38,39 Althoug some studies suggest superior functional outcomes with TORS compared to CRT or RT, 55 56 a more recently published randomize trial compared swallowrelated outcomes in patients with T1-T2 N0-N2 (LN \u2264 4 cm) treated with primary RT versus those treated with TORS and showed that RT arm had better outcomes. Nevertheless, this difference was not clinically meaningful and became less pronounced with the passage of time. 57 Single modality therapy is recommended for patients with early-stage OPSCC to avoid the adverse effects of combined modality therapy. 32,33,36 In this context, given the potential late adverse effects of RT, TORS is highly promising. Furthermore, surgical resection of the tumor allows for adequate histopathologic staging of the neoplasm and identification of patients who would benefit from adjuvant therapy. 32,33 If pathologic analysis of the resected tumor shows extracapsular spread with positive margins unsuitable for reapproach, adjuvant CRT is recommended. 32,33,36 Approximately 75%---81% of patients with OPSCC are diagnosed in stages III or IV, 40,41 in which the treatment strategy is challenging due to the greater extent of disease. For adequate exposure of the tumor for resection, different techniques are used based on the size and anatomic site of the neoplasm. 32,33 Macroscopic tumor-free margins of 1.5---2.0 cm are recommended in combination with frozen section analysis, which requires extensive surgery, but few centers have the expertise to perform it. 32 Therefore, different cancer centers use surgery, RT, and CT in a variety of combinations for patients with advanced-stage OPSCC. 33 Studies comparing the outcomes of",

            "text": "The standard of care for early-stage NSCLC has historically been surgical resection. Given the association of lung cancer with smoking, a large number of early-stage patients also have active smoking-related medical comorbidities such as COPD precluding surgery. The current approach for treating such inoperable patients is frequently considered to be stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). SBRT (also known as stereotactic ablative radiation therapy or SABR) is a curative modality that precisely delivers very high dose radiation in few (typically <5) sessions. That said, because of their minimal invasiveness and repeatable nature, image-guided thermal ablation therapies such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA), microwave ablation (MWA), and cryoablation (CA) have also been used to treat early-stage lung tumors. For those patients deemed to have \u201chigh operative risk\u201d (i.e., those who cannot tolerate lobectomy, but are candidates for sublobar resection), the appropriateness of potential alternatives [e.g., SBRT; ablation] to surgery is an active area of investigation. In the absence of completed randomized phase III trials, the approach to comparing outcomes between surgery, SBRT, or ablative therapies by their efficacy or equivalence is complex. An overview of the role of SBRT and other non-surgical modalities in the management of early-stage lung cancer is the subject of the present review.",

By performing surgery as the primary treatment modality, it is possible to remove Fig. 3 Forest plot of the subgroup analysis concerning overall survival. HR hazard ratio, CI confidence interval, FIGO the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics, PORT postoperative radiotherapy, RT radiotherapy substantial volumes of radioresistant AC tumors, which may result in superior OS and CSS when compared to definitive CCRT [7,24]. \n\nThe survival outcomes of patients with AC decrease significantly as the size of the tumor increases. Tumor size greater than 40 mm is a significant adverse prognostic factor for survival, as demonstrated by previous studies [3,26,27], which is consistent with our findings. In our study, patients with tumors larger than 40 mm or 60 mm exhibited a poorer prognosis than those with tumors 40 mm or smaller. It is noteworthy that subgroup analysis revealed no significant difference in OS and CSS outcomes between patients with tumor size greater than 60 mm who underwent surgery with PORT compared to those treated with Primary RT alone. Similarly, previous studies have established a correlation between older age and poor outcomes, a finding that is consistent with our results [3,28]. In our study, surgery with PORT was not associated with improved CSS in patients older than 65 years. Therefore, for patients with tumor size exceeding 60 mm or who are 65 years of age or older, the selection of local treatment modalities should be based on careful consideration of individualized patient factors. \n\nOur study possesses several notable strengths, with the foremost among them being the implementation of PSM to adjust for potential confounding factors and the utilization of a sizable sample obtained from the SEER database. Nonetheless, our investigation is not devoid of limitations. Notably, a restricted subset comprising 178 individuals (13.1%) did not undergo chemotherapy, Fig. 4 Forest plot of the subgroup analysis concerning cancer-specific survival.",

[7,8] fter the application of IMRT in the treatment of NPC, results showed that IMRT can improve oncologic outcomes. Comparisons of outcomes of CRT and IMRT have been still debated. Moon et al [9] compared outcomes of CRT and IMRT in patients with NPC, 390 and 497 patients were treated with CRT and IMRT respectively. Results displayed that IMRT was associated with a better local progression-free survival and overall survival than CRT for the treatment of NPC. IMRT was significantly superior in terms of overall survival for advanced primary tumors. [1] Fang et al [10] reported a study to investigate survival outcomes for patients with NPC treated by CRT and IMRT. Two hundred three NPC patients, who were treated by CRT (n = 93) or IMRT (n = 110) between March 2002 and July 2004, were analyzed. Results showed that the 3-year locoregional control, metastasis-free survival, and overall survival rates were 84.8%, 76.7%, and 81.7% for the CRT group, respectively, compared with 84.2%, 82.6%, and 85.4% for the IMRT group. Lee et al [19] also suggested that IMRT treatment showed no further improvement compared with CRT.",

[37,43] Surgery is the frontline treatment for buccal mucosa cancer. [44] In our study, all the patients were treated with surgery either alone or in combination with RT or radiochemotherapy (RT + CT). Patients with surgery (63.3%) alone were found to have the best 5-year survival as compared to with surgery + RT (49.7%) or surgery + RT + CT (44.1%); however, in multivariate analysis, treatment was not found to be an independent prognostic factor. Selection of treatment modalities is not only according to primary carcinoma extension but also might be decided by many other important clinical indices (i.e., tumor size, clinical stage, distant metastasis, histological differentiation, and lymph node involvement). Individuals who accepted surgery alone are often at an earlier clinical stage (75% cases of Stage I in our study were treated with surgery alone). Therefore, the better survival rates seen in only surgically treated patients might have been due to differences in disease stage and presence of other tumor-related prognostic factors, rather than differences in effectiveness of treatment methods. [45] Furthermore, the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the various prognostic factors adjusted for treatment rather than to assess the efficacy of different treatment modalities.\n\nThere were several limitations of our study which need to be acknowledged. The study was conducted at a single institution, was of retrospective nature, and relies on data not primarily meant for research. Therefore, our study might be limited by biases, such as lack of random assignment, patient selection, and incomplete data acquisition, particularly in case of comorbidities, as only those conditions that were recorded in the medical case sheets were taken into consideration. A prospectively collected data will identify more detailed prognostic factors that can better account for the outcomes. Second, the single-institutional nature of our dataset may again be interpreted as a limitation, as demographic characteristics of the study cohort may be unique and may not be relevant in risk prediction of other patient populations.

            "text": "G allbladder cancer (GBC) is relatively rare in Western populations, and its reported prognosis is poorer than in some of the nations in which GBC is more prevalent, such as Chile, Korea, and Japan. 1,2 Curative surgical resection is the treatment of choice, as there are currently no effective systemic treatments. Thus, selection of candidates for surgery and determination of type of surgery are crucial in enhancing survival outcomes in patients with GBC. Survival outcomes have been shown to depend on surgical strategy, pathologic stage, comorbidities, and experience of the surgical unit. 3 n contrast to other organs of the gastrointestinal tract, the gallbladder lacks submucosa and partially serosa with a relatively thin proper muscle layer. This can allow tumor cells to easily invade or metastasize to other organs, which results in reduced survival outcomes. Thus, early detection and optimal treatment are key factors determining survival outcomes in patients with GBC. Improvements in radiologic imaging; increased screening of high-risk patients, including those with GB stones and polyps; and the universal use of laparoscopic cholecystectomy have increased the proportion of GBCs detected early. ][9] Previous studies reported poor outcomes after laparoscopic surgery on GBC, including port site metastasis and poorer survival. 10,11 However, the development of new instruments and advanced surgical techniques has resulted in laparoscopic surgery becoming widely accepted as a feasible and safe treatment modality for many GI tract cancers. ][14] Surprisingly, consensus guidelines on GBC are based mostly on data reported before 2000. More recent studies on patients with early GBC, however, have reported markedly improved treatment outcomes after laparoscopic than after open surgery. 15,16 This study was therefore designed to evaluate and compare recent surgical outcomes of laparoscopic and open surgery for early GBC with pathologically proven T1 and to determine the optimal surgical strategy based on clinical data of patients who underwent surgery for early GBC cohort in the 21st century.",

            "text": "Globally, cervical cancer is the second most common type of cancer among female malignancies, with high mortality in developing countries [18]. Although the treatment of cervical cancer has been developed, there are still significant negative consequences for the patients [19]. The importance of measuring the QoL arises from the knowledge that cervical cancer patients have been found to have worse QoL scores due to cancer treatment, not only when compared to the general population, but also when compared with other gynecological cancer survivors [20]. \n\nAlthough definitive CRT is considered to be the therapy of choice for LACC, the role of surgery remains controversial [5, 12,21]. As for neoadjuvant RT before surgery, it is recommended for tumor shrinking, allowing for better surgical resection [22,23], while neoadjuvant CT increases the sensitivity to radiation of the malignant cells [24]. Tongqing et al. [25] compared the outcomes of patients who were treated with neoadjuvant RT followed by surgery to those who received only surgery, achieving similar five-year OS between the two groups (80% vs. 74.7%). Benedetti-Panici et al. [26], showed that neoadjuvant CT and neoadjuvant CRT administered before surgery can achieve better OS compared to patients only undergoing surgery [26]. However, in the current study, the patients who had undergone surgery alone obtained a higher five-year OS of 79.9%, than the neoadjuvant RT + surgery group with 77.6% and the neoadjuvant CRT + surgery group with 66.4%. This result may have occurred since the patients with the early-stage disease were treated with surgery only, compared to the other two groups of patients with LACC who required neoadjuvant treatment before surgery, hence the inferior OS. \n\nThe surgery has to be followed by adjuvant therapy to increase local control when pathological risk factors are identified [27][28][29].",

Thirty patients underwent IORT with surgery, 31 underwent PORT after surgery, and 38 underwent definitive radiotherapy. Tumor stage [Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) 2009] was as follows: Stage I, 7; IIA, 16; IIB, 31; III, 45. The doses for IORT, PORT, and definitive radio therapy were 20 to 30, 40 to 64.6, and 50.4 to 61.2 Gy, respectively. Associations between clinical parameters including age, gender, tumor site, stage, performance status, surgical margin, and use of chemotherapy and local control (LC) or overall survival (OS) were analyzed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFollow-up periods for all patients were 1.1-145 months (median, 11). OS rate in the IORT, PORT, and definitive radiotherapy groups was 22%, 16%, and 6%, respectively, at 2 years. The 5-year OS rate was 13%, 3.2%, and 0%, respectively. Local control rate at 2 years was 33%, 35%, and 0%, respectively. No Grade \u2265 3 tox icities were observed. Distant metastasis was less common in the IORT group. Stage and surgical margin were sig nificant factors for OS after IORT. Performance status and chemotherapy were significant factors for OS after PORT and definitive radiotherapy.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe present study showed the safety of the three treatment modalities, but the outcomes were not satisfactory. More intensive strategies including radiotherapy should be investigated.",

Misdiagnoses of the T and N stages, including overestimation and underestimation, lead to overtreatment or undertreatment based on the current National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines, resulting in unexpected outcomes.

            "text": "Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in American men, and it is associated with increasing incidence rates [1][2][3]. Current prostate cancer clinical management guidelines are leading to an increasing number of instances where patients are submitted to active surveillance (low risk prostate cancer patients) and do not need to undergo surgery. However, surgery can be recommended for higher risk prostate cancers and in that case the only curative treatment is radical prostatectomy. There were more than 1300 radical prostatectomy procedures per million men in 2011 in the United States [4][5][6][7]. Worldwide, increasing numbers of radical prostatectomy procedures are performed using robotic-assisted surgical systems, which can result in reduced side effects, increased normal tissue sparing, reduced loss of blood and shorter hospital stays [8,9]. \n\nRates of remission following radical prostatectomy procedures are strongly influenced by the extent to which completeness of cancer resection is attained [10,11]. Because cancer frequently extends beyond the prostatic capsule [12], ensuring safety margins is often the adopted surgical strategy. The extent of surgical resection is then determined by multiple factors, including patient pre-surgical prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, clinical stage and pathological findings at diagnosis, as well as quality-of-life after the surgery [13][14][15]. Procedures are not only optimal when residual extra-prostatic cancer is avoided but also when damage to critical organs and structures, including bladder and nerves [16], is minimized. Less extended margins lower the risk of damage to surrounding tissue and increase post-procedure patient satisfaction by reducing side effects [17,18]. However, positive margins from un-resected cancer extending beyond the prostate decrease survival rates and lead to additional treatments [19,20]. As a result, radical prostatectomy procedures are performed by balancing the need to remove the entire prostate and leave no residual tumor tissue against the need to minimize healthy tissue damage. \n\nUnlike surgical oncology approaches where co-registration methods with other imaging modalities are used to guide resection (e.g. magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in brain cancer) [21], prostate cancer is usually not detectable using standard imaging techniques although MRI-based prostate cancer detection shows promises [22].",

            "text": "Some endometrial cancer (EMC) patients are not good candidates for primary surgery. The three major types of treatment for inoperable EMC are radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or their combination as neoadjuvant treatment before surgery. Radiation therapy alone (of different modes) has been used as the sole definitive therapeutic modality, particularly for early-stage disease that is limited to the uterine body and cervix with or without parametrial invasion. The most common treatment modality is neoadjuvant treatment before surgery. Postoperative adjuvant treatment is also occasionally used, depending mainly on the sites of the disease and the results of surgery. Data on neoadjuvant hormonal or radiation therapy are limited, with studies focusing on laboratory outcomes or having only a small number of patients. Most neoadjuvant treatments before surgery involved chemotherapy and fewer combined chemoradiotherapy. Surgery was generally performed, particularly in patients who had shown responses or at least stable disease to neoadjuvant treatment. Perioperative outcomes after neoadjuvant treatment were superior to those after primary surgery, whereas survival data were still inconsistent. Features that had or tended to have a favorable prognosis were younger age, early-stage disease, response to neoadjuvant treatment, low preoperative cancer antigen-125 level, and optimal surgery. Among different modalities of neoadjuvant treatment, which has become a frequent mode of treatment, neoadjuvant chemotherapy was more common than radiation therapy alone or chemoradiation.",

Advances in understanding intrahepatic anatomy and surgical techniques has led to the performance of major hepatic resection with acceptable morbidity and mortality rates [3]. Although hepatic resection is considered the optimal management liver metastases, only 10-20% of patients are suitable candidates for surgery [4]. Due to technical challenges associated with the surgical treatment of liver metastasis, several alternative therapeutic modalities have been described in the literature, including radiofrequency ablation (RFA), trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE), laser-induced thermotherapy (LITT), selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT), and stereotactic body radiation therapy. Interestingly, the role of SBRT as a cytoreductive approach for liver oligometastases is well established, demonstrating effective local control and favorable overall survival rates in oligometastatic patients [5][6][7]. \n\nThe aim of this study was to systematically review the literature regarding the role of rSBRT in the management of metastatic liver disease from tumors of various origins, with a focus on evaluating clinical outcomes and treatment-related toxicity in treated patients. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review that evaluates the role of rSBRT in the management of liver metastasis.",

            "text": "Rectal cancer is the third most common malignancy in the western world, and is the second most common cause of cancer deaths (1,2). Surgical excision is the primary treatment modality and because local recurrence after resection is associated with a poor prognosis, much attention has been focused on determining the best diagnostic and treatment strategies to optimize local control of the primary tumour (3). \n\nSurgical excision of rectal cancer consists of either transanal local excision, endoscopic microsurgery or total mesorectal excision. The stage of the tumour, based on the tumour, node, metastasis classification system (Table 1), impacts heavily on prognosis and determines the type of surgical procedure performed (4,5). Transanal local excision or endoscopic microsurgery are considered for cancers staged at T1 or lower, while total mesorectal excision would be reserved for stages T2 and T3. Thus, accurate preoperative staging of rectal tumours is paramount in guiding the type of surgical procedure performed. \n\nComputed tomography (CT), MRI and EUS have all been used to stage rectal tumours; however, controversy exists as to which diagnostic imaging modality provides the most accurate information. The diagnostic accuracy of these imaging techniques for assessing the depth of tumour invasion, spread to the mesorectal fascia and lymph node involvement has been compared extensively. The findings of the largest and most recent trials are discussed in the present article and are summarized in Table 2. \n\nA recent meta-analysis (6) found that EUS, when compared with MRI, overstaged muscularis propria invasion in T1 cancers, while CT and MRI each significantly understaged perirectal tissue invasion for tumours staged at T3 or greater. A second meta-analysis (7) found that EUS was also more effective at identifying nodal status than MRI and CT, although the finding was not statistically significant. Furthermore, only MRI was able to predict circumferential resection margins with accuracy. \n\nFindings from other studies have contradicted these results.",

            "text": "Gynecologic cancer, or GYN cancer for short, is cancer that starts in a woman's reproductive system. The most common GYN malignancies include tumors of the vulvar, vaginal, ovarian, uterine, and cervical regions. Gynecologic cancers afflict over 94,000 women in the US each year. The most common kind of GYN cancer is uterine cancer, which is followed by ovarian and cervical cancer [1]. Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in the world for which women are diagnosed [2]. Treatment options for GYN cancers include radiation, chemotherapy, and surgery [3]. After surgery, adjuvant or final radiation is often given to patients with high-risk features or locally advanced diseases. In contrast, brachytherapy is a further form of radiation therapy that may be administered to others [4]. \n\nAdaptive radiation was first described in the 1990s by Yan et al. This publication's authors described a radiation therapy that could be modified as it was being administered in response to changes in anatomy [5]. For the treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer, cisplatin and concurrent external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) are frequently utilized in addition to brachytherapy. The term \"adaptive radiation therapy\" (ART) refers to methods that let a radiation therapy treatment plan change based on pictures obtained while the patient is receiving treatment. The switch to image-guided adaptive brachytherapy (IGABT) for cervical cancer demonstrates the benefits of this strategy [6]. Adaptive radiation can be very beneficial for GYN tumors for two main reasons. First, the size of GYN malignancies, including cervical cancer, can vary significantly after treatment. By taking these variations in tumor size into account, adaptive radiation treatment may be able to target less healthy tissue while still treating cancer [3]. \n\nIn wealthy nations, endometrial carcinoma is the most prevalent type of gynecologic cancer. Depending on the stage and grade of the disease, adjuvant radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and surgery are usually the next steps in the treatment procedure [7]. To potentially improve outcomes and minimize side effects, ART can be adjusted to account for changes in the tumor's growth and the patient's anatomy throughout radiation therapy.",

            "text": "Oligometastatic prostate cancer represents a distinct clinical entity within the spectrum of metastatic disease, characterized by a limited number of metastases predominantly localized to specific anatomical sites [1] .This intermediate stage between localized and widespread metastases has sparked considerable interest in exploring optimal treatment strategies that may prolong survival and enhance the quality of life for affected patients [2][3][4] .Among the therapeutic modalities gaining prominence are cytoreductive surgery and radiotherapy [5,6] , each offering distinct advantages and potential outcomes.\n\nCytoreductive surgery involves the surgical removal of metastatic lesions with the intent of reducing tumor burden and potentially delaying disease progression [7][8][9] .Radiotherapy, on the other hand, delivers targeted ionizing radiation to cancer cells, aiming to achieve local tumor control and alleviate symptoms [10][11][12] .Both approaches have demonstrated efficacy in certain clinical settings, but a comprehensive comparison of their relative benefits and limitations is essential to guide clinical decision-making.While clinical trials have contributed to our understanding of these treatments, they often have limitations in terms of patient selection and follow-up duration.In addition, real-world retrospective cohort studies, by virtue of their inclusion of broader patient populations and longer-term outcomes, can provide valuable insights into the practical application and outcomes of cytoreductive surgery and radiotherapy in the management of oligometastatic prostate cancer.\n\nIn this context, we conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis and retrospective cohort study to systematically compare the efficacy of cytoreductive surgery with radiotherapy in treating oligometastatic prostate cancer.By synthesizing existing evidence from the literature and evaluating the outcomes of a well-defined cohort of patients, we sought to address critical questions regarding overall survival, progression-free survival, and treatment-related adverse events associated with these interventions.\n\nThis study contributes to the growing body of knowledge surrounding the management of oligometastatic prostate cancer, shedding light on the practical effectiveness and potential benefits of cytoreductive surgery and radiotherapy.The insights gained from this research are poised to inform clinical decision-making and guide the development of personalized treatment strategies for patients at this intermediate stage of disease progression.",

For each patient, the recurrence pattern was assessed by specialist radiologists from the MDT using imaging, and the treatment strategy was decided after discussion by the MDT. The associations between clinicopathological factors and long-term outcomes were evaluated using both univariate and multivariate analysis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe recurrence pattern was classified as follows: Twenty-seven (30%) recurrent tumors were evaluated as axial type, 21 (23.3%) were anterior type, 8 (8.9%) were posterior type, and 13 (25.6%) were lateral type. Forty-one patients had tumors that were evaluated as resectable by the MDT and ultimately received surgery, and R0 resection was achieved in 36 (87.8%) of these patients. The recurrence pattern was closely associated with resectability and R0 resection rate (P < 0.001). The recurrence pattern, interval to recurrence, and R0 resection were significantly associated with 5-year survival rate in univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis showed that the R0 resection was the unique independent factor affecting long-term survival.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe MDT modality improves patient selection for surgery by enabling accurate classification of the recurrence pattern; R0 resection is the most significant factor affecting long-term survival.",

            "text": "The highest pCR rates of 21% were achieved with scRT/CRT + CTX compared with 13% with CRT and 8% with scRT in this pooled analysis of rectal cancer patients who underwent surgery after a delay following pre-treatment. Independent factors associated with pCR were cT1-2, tumour length \u2264 3.5 cm, normal CEA, and treatment modality. Leucocytosis also adds to the model. This may have practical importance when discussing whether a non-surgical W&W approach could be recommended prior to treatment initiation. \n\nOur population-based results indicate that treatment with RT, either preceded or followed by systemic chemotherapy, i.e., TNT, is the most effective treatment modality for achieving pCR. In recent years, the focus has been directed towards more extensive administration of chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting and several clinical trials have been performed or are ongoing [9,10,25,26]. Results from the RAPIDO study demonstrated the superiority of scRT + CTX versus CRT in preventing disease-related events, predominantly systemic recurrences, and support our findings regarding the hierarchy of preoperative treatments in achieving pCR [9]. Despite a two-fold higher chance of pCR in the experimental group (28% versus 14%) [9], a 5-year update of the trial has revealed more locoregional failures in the experimental group (12% vs. 8%, p = 0.07) [27]. Results from the US OPRA study with CRT and chemotherapy either as induction or consolidation showed better organ preservation rates (3-year TME-free survival rate 41% vs. 53%), when the chemotherapy was given as consolidation after CRT [11]. \n\nSeveral studies have reported cT-stage as an independent variable to predict pCR [28,29], in line with our findings. Our cohort of patients with cT1-2 tumours was limited (n = 62, as most patients with cT1-2 tumours underwent surgery directly or were treated with scRT without a delay to surgery and were thus excluded from analysis), but achieved a pCR rate of 23%, and this was as high as 50% in the CRT group.",

            "text": "Background The optimal treatment strategy for patients with early glottic (T1\u20132N0M0) squamous cancer remains unclear. Methods A retrospective population-based analysis was performed using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to balance treatment arms, and Cox regression analysis was used to determine prognostic factors for survival. Kaplan-Meier analysis, log-rank tests, and competing risk analysis were used to compare survival outcomes between treatment modalities (surgery vs. radiotherapy). Results Among the 3,994 eligible patients in this study, surgery was associated with improved cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS) compared with radiotherapy (log-rank test, P<0.05). This survival trend favoring surgery was consistent in the T1a, well/moderately differentiated grade, male, and all age subgroups. However, after the baseline characteristics were balanced with PSM, the survival outcomes (CSS and OS) did not differ significantly between the surgery and radiotherapy groups. Interestingly, surgery was associated with a 39% reduced risk of cancer-related death compared with radiotherapy in patients aged \u226570 years (hazard ratio 0.61; 95% CI: 0.43\u20130.87; P=0.006). However, this survival trend favoring surgery was not observed in younger patients (age <70 years), T stage subgroups, male or female subgroups, or in any of the pathological grade subgroups. Conclusions In patients with early glottic squamous cell carcinoma undergoing surgery or radiotherapy, there is no sufficient evidence favoring one method over another in terms of survival. However, surgery is recommended in patients aged \u226570 years because, in this group, it was associated with improved survival outcomes compared with radiotherapy.",

Ongoing randomized studies are needed to identify the optimal candidates for neoadjuvant therapy. The search for novel biomarkers holds promise for refining decision-making processes in an era of precision medicine, tailoring therapies to specific cases. Surgical excision, which involves vascular resection, is the cornerstone of curative intervention and offers potential benefits in achieving clear margins. However, the survival advantage associated with venous resection warrants further investigation through retrospective studies, shedding light on patient outcomes and contributing valuable insights for future guidelines (334). \n\nDespite progress in neoadjuvant and multimodal therapies, postoperative relapses persist as a formidable challenge, necessitating innovative interventions (335). The complex interaction among neoplastic and stromal components within tumor surroundings adds complexity to the disease. Although surgery remains the primary remedial modality for initial-stage patients, patients with advanced disease require a comprehensive approach involving chemotherapeutic regimens, radiation therapy, and targeted interventions. Promising strategies for immunotherapy are hampered by immune evasion mechanisms (336). \n\nThe 5-year overall survival rate of individuals with pancreatic cancer who received FDA-approved chemotherapy and targeted therapies has increased from approximately 2% ten years ago to 11% by 2022 (337). Nevertheless, a deeper understanding of the biological intricacies inherent in PDAC subtypes has facilitated the way for more refined and targeted therapeutic strategies (338). New methodologies in clinical trial design, encompassing drug lead-in, neoadjuvant exploration of investigational agents, and the implementation of platform studies for accelerated evaluation of combinations, are driving progress. Over the subsequent decade, one might expect apparent advancements in clinical outcomes for a more extensive cohort of patients undergoing treatment with tailored combinations of therapeutic agents (339).",

[5] The same principle is now used in our hospital.\n\nFor advanced hypopharyngeal carcinoma, the optimal treatment remains under debate. A systematic review from Habib [6] compared survival following surgical and non-surgical treatments. Two randomized trials and 11 observational studies were included. They concluded that CRT offers similar survivorship compared to surgery in advanced disease, and it can be used as a treatment in all the patients as an alternative to surgery. Some articles share the same view. Zhang et al [7] compared the treatment outcomes for locally advanced hypopharyngeal carcinoma between surgery plus radio (chemo) therapy (SRT) and non-surgery CRT. A total of 119 patients were divided into two groups: 42 cases in the SRT group and 77 cases in the CRT group. There were no significant differences between the SRT and CRT groups for 5-year disease-free survival (53.9% vs. 45.1%, x 2 = 1.251, P = 0.263) and OS (54.9% vs. 45.6%, x 2 = 1.749, P = 0.186). Compared to the SRT group, the CRT group did not show a significant increase of treatment complications (x 2 = 0.858, P = 0.354), but demonstrated a higher laryngeal preservation rate (50.0% vs. 71.4%, x 2 = 6.493, P = 0.011). Combined modality treatment is a main approach for advanced hypopharyngeal cancer. Researchers concluded that SRT offers disease-free survival and OS rates equivalent to CRT, but with a higher laryngeal preservation rate. [7] The result of our study was similar with those studies.

Real-time in-bore image guided biopsy showed best yield in clinically significant cancers, however, also require the most resources. Given the wider availability, practicability and lower costs, MR-TRUS fusion-targeted biopsy has become the most commonly used technique. In localized, nonmetastatic PC, focal therapy of the index tumor has become popular. These include transrectal, transperineal or transurethral HIFU, FLA, and cryotherapy. In-bore targeted focal therapy leverages MR thermometry with real-time heat-modulation and better treatment control. Compared to traditional whole gland treatment, significantly lower functional side effects were observed with this minimal invasive approach. All show early tumor control with each modality having different advantages and disadvantages, may it be quality of image guidance, degree of tissue destruction, or extent of ablation margin. The high local relapse rate may reflect these limitations. Subsequent repeat focal therapy or salvage whole gland treatment are feasible. Thus, initial local approaches might prolong the time to radical whole gland treatment. Prospective long-term oncologic and functional outcome data are still scarce, especially no randomized controlled trials comparing the various focal treatments to each other are yet available. However, the current data are encouraging and further studies are warranted.\n\nAssessment of treatment response is an area of unmet clinical need. PSA decreases after treatment to a variable nadir after focal therapies, and mpMRI is limited by post-treatment artifacts that can mask in-field recurrence. Currently, post-treatment biopsy is the most accurate method for treatment verification. PET might be a suitable non-invasive modality to show treatment success. More prospective studies are needed to support the encouraging preliminary results.\n\nFuture developments include artificial intelligence and radiomics assisted risk prediction and treatment planning [113]. The use of robotic arms to support navigation and carrying out biopsy or local treatment may increase precision. Furthermore, advancement in scanner hardware and software will allow for faster MRI sequences and increased image quality.

            "text": "Among all cancers, liver cancer currently ranks sixth in terms of incidence and third in terms of cancer-related mortality worldwide.Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents the most common form of primary liver cancer (75-80%) [1].The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system is used to classify HCC into four broad categories (early Cancers 2021, 13, 2984 2 of 16 (A), intermediate (B), advanced (C), and terminal (D) stages) [2].Early-stage (BCLC A) HCC patients can benefit from curative treatments, including resection, transplantation, and ablation therapies [3].Patients with a solitary tumor and well-preserved baseline liver function (Child-Pugh A; no portal hypertension) are considered to be optimal surgical candidates for hepatectomy with curative intent [4,5].Patients who do not qualify for surgical resection and have a limited disease burden, as defined by various selection criteria (e.g., Milan criteria, extended Toronto criteria, University of California San Francisco criteria), may receive liver transplantation [6][7][8].Patients with small tumors in whom surgery might entail significant morbidity may opt for ablation therapy instead [4], even though surgery is associated with superior oncological outcomes [9].Despite the fact that many patients may not qualify as optimal surgical candidates due to impaired liver function or multinodular disease, resection is still considered the primary therapeutic modality for early-stage HCC in most cases, as the scarcity of liver donors has resulted in long waiting lists for transplantation [3].\n\nTumor recurrence following hepatectomy remains a major hurdle in the successful management of early-stage HCC.Even for small tumors, the 5-year recurrence rate following resection is almost 70% [10].A variety of strategies employing adjuvant therapeutic modalities (both systemic and locoregional) have been proposed over the years, aiming to reduce recurrence following resection with varying success.",

            "text": "Pros-IT CNR data also support this conclusion [26]. \n\nIn our data, 2.4% of patients underwent surgery followed by adjuvant RT, 1.8% surgery, RT and ADT, 3% surgery and ADT, the latter in particular when the patient was characterized by high risk features (T3 and GS >7). \n\nStudies comparing cost-effectiveness and QOL in patients undergoing surgery vs RT vs combined modality treatments have produced conflicting findings. While one report published in 2012 favored RT plus ADT for high-risk PCA [27], another one published in 2013 supported the use of surgery for intermediate-to-high risk PCA [28]. When Dorth et al. conducted a cost effectiveness analysis on intermediate-to-high risk PCA and compared RT plus ADT vs surgery using a Markov model, their data showed that the former was characterized by better results in terms of clinical outcome and quality-adjusted life expectancy [29][30]. An increase in the fraction of high-risk patients treated with surgery has been reported also by the aalysis of the SEER database for the years 2010-2015; this increase does not seem completely justified by the current guidelines [31]. \n\nIn Italy, an increase in the use of External Beam RT (EBRT) for curative treatment of PCA has been documented in two subsequent patterns of practice studies run under the aegis of Italian Association for Radiotherapy and Clinical Oncology (AIRO) [32][33]. In the present study, patients treated with EBRT have been referred to radiation oncologist for the most by urologists. Seventy-five percent underwent IGRT; 33.2% 3D-CRT technique, 41.2% IMRT, 24.4% VMAT, 1.2% SBRT. These results seem to confirm that the new technologies are increasingly being used by Italian Radiation Oncology Centers. In comparison with previous patterns of practice studies supported by AIRO, the percentage of PCA patients treated with new RT technologies has increased considerably over recent years, confirming the conclusion that IGRT can improve RT treatment accuracy [34] and may reduce severe acute and late urinary/rectal side effects [35].",

            "text": "The field of molecular imaging biomarkers is evolving rapidly with the introduction of new technologies that hold great potential for early cancer detection. PET imaging, particularly with innovative tracers like [ 68 Ga]-PSMA for prostate cancer and [ 18 F]-FES for breast cancer, has demonstrated superior sensitivity and specificity due to its ability to target precise molecular processes [81]. These tracers' capability to target precise molecular processes or receptors enables the more accurate identification of early-stage cancers. Although optical imaging methods have limitations in detecting tumors located deep within the body, they have demonstrated exceptional specificity in surgical settings. Using fluorescence-guided surgery with substances such as 5-ALA could enhance surgical outcomes by facilitating more thorough tumor removal [9]. \n\nAdditionally, molecular imaging using targeted nanoparticles and hyperpolarized [ 13 C]-pyruvate has shown promise in prostate cancer detection, potentially reducing biopsy needs [82]. Ultrasonic molecular imaging, though very new compared to other medical techniques, shows promising results for people with prostate cancer treated with immunotherapy. It is possible to identify the immunotherapy peptides on the cells and do an ultrasound with the help of contrast agents [9]. Each technique has its benefits and drawbacks that could differ depending on several factors in choosing an imaging modality for a specific type of cancer, cancer stage, and clinical scenario. For example, implementing several imaging modalities like PET/MRI or PET/CT gives more details and improves diagnosis [83].",

            "text": "The findings indicate that cancer stage significantly affects survival outcomes for appendiceal cancer patients. For both adenocarcinoma and mucinous carcinoma, higher cancer stages (Stages II, III, and IV) were associated with increased mortality risk (p < 0.001). Although there was no difference in Stage 0, Stages I and II were more frequently observed in AC, while Stage IV was more common in MAC. The likelihood of presenting with Stage IV disease was 2.5 times higher in MAC compared to AC (47% vs. 19%, respectively). While this finding aligns with previous reports in the literature, our analysis showed an even higher rate. Stage III disease was relatively rare in MAC (9%) but more pronounced in AC (19.4%). These findings, consistent with the literature, suggest that MAC has a higher tendency for peritoneal metastasis rather than lymphatic metastasis. These results highlight the importance of cancer stage in treatment planning and prognosis prediction [12,14]. \n\nThe positive effects of surgery and chemotherapy on survival were clearly demonstrated in this study. Surgical treatment emerged as the most significant factor in improving survival for both groups. The rate of surgical intervention was significantly higher in the AC group compared to the MAC group (p < 0.001). For both AC and MAC, not undergoing surgery was associated with a significantly higher risk of mortality (p < 0.001). \n\nFurthermore, chemotherapy played a particularly beneficial role in improving survival in the adenocarcinoma group. On the other hand, the impact of radiotherapy on survival was found to be more limited, a finding consistent with the literature. The optimal combination of treatment modalities, especially for more aggressive tumor types like adenocarcinoma, has the potential to improve patient prognosis [1,2,10,[16][17][18]. \n\nThis study demonstrated significant clinical and biological differences between AC and MAC, highlighting the need for subtype-specific management strategies. Although MAC patients exhibited better survival rates, they were generally diagnosed at more advanced stages. These findings emphasize the importance of individualized treatment planning based on tumor subtype. Surgery and chemotherapy were clearly identified as the most significant factors positively influencing survival.",

            "text": "Regardless of the surgical treatment modality, the most crucial factor is the surgeon's competence in performing curative resection with precise dissection along the embryonic plane, while preserving the pelvic nervous system. Adherence to surgical principles is the most significant prognostic factor for oncologic outcomes. In 2008, we reported on the oncologic outcomes following TME for rectal cancer. A total of 1,276 patients were analyzed, with a mean follow-up period of 69.4 months. The 5-year overall local recurrence rates were 3.8% for stage I, 4.7% for stage II, and 8.4% for stage III. Additionally, the 5-year cancer-specific survival rates were 93.8% for stage I, 84.5% for stage II, and 64.5% for stage III [93]. In 2009, we also published an analysis of the operative safety and oncologic outcomes of anal sphincter-preserving surgery with mesorectal excision for rectal cancer, based on data from 931 patients [94]. Patients treated between 1989 and 2004 were analyzed; during the study period, a multidisciplinary team approach and tailored mesorectal excision became more popular between 1997 and 2004. We divided the patients into 2 groups (n = 208 from 1989-1996, n = 723 from 1997-2004). There were no significant differences between the 2 periods regarding anastomotic leakage (2.4% vs 3.6%), cancer-specific survival rates (79.1% vs 79.6%), and local recurrence rates (8.4% vs 8.6%). We further analyzed patients who underwent TME for rectal cancer, comparing MIS with open surgery [95]. This case-matched study included 633 patients (MIS, n = 211; open, n = 422) treated be-tween 2003 and 2008, with a median follow-up period of 64 months. The anastomotic leakage rate was 4% for open surgery versus 6% for MIS. MIS consisted of laparoscopic (59%) and robotic approaches (41%).",

Compared with the surgery with RT group, both localized and metastatic patients treated with CT showed significantly worse outcomes in OS and CSS, while the surgery and CT group and surgery and CT and RT group showed significantly worse OS only in localized patients. Particularly, the surgery alone was associated with a higher hazard for OS in metastatic patients compared with the surgery with RT group [hazard ratio (HR): 1.6; 95% CI: (1.05, 2.42); P value: = 0.03].

            "text": "Surgery and radiation remain strong curative modalities for treatment of established solid tumors but treatment failure continues to be a significant problem. The best established role of surgical oncology is the complete removal of the tumor, with an additional strong foundation to question the elective treatment of uninvolved regional lymph nodes in a large variety of tumor types and resection of metastatic disease which is increasingly offered to selected patients with indolent oligometastatic disease (52). Critical to all of them is securing negative surgical margins. \n\nLess invasive technologies and advances in imaging leading to minimally invasive and robot-assisted surgeries are revolutionizing surgical care (5). Likewise, advanced image guidance and motion management strategies are shaping new therapeutic radiation strategies enabling the safe administration of ablative doses of radiation (2). Advanced imaging is fundamental and uniquely placed to serve both margin negativity rates and future radiation strategies. \n\nSurgical margin positivity rate (cancer cells at the edge of tumor resection) has not significantly improved in recent decades and when it does occur prognosis is significantly affected in many tumor types. Margin positivity rates across all types of cancer range from 15 to 60% (53). A recent report on positive surgical margins in the ten most common solid cancers has identified oral cavity cancer with the highest rate with up to 25% of cases, no change over time, with significant effects on tumor relapse and overall survival. For advanced disease, the rates ranged between 20.9% (breast) and 65.5% (prostate) with related worse outcome in seven tumor types (54). Although not a true resistance type, we propose the term \"margin-missing\" effect to characterize this situation which leads to treatment failure and resistance. \n\nFluorescence-guided surgery, which allows intraoperative visualization of tumors, is an evolving image-guided surgical strategy to help differentiate tumor cells from normal surrounding tissues in real time. Near-infrared fluorescence imaging has a higher tumor to background ratio, high tissue penetration (5-10 mm), and little interference from intrinsic fluorescence. Indocyanine green is the most widely used probe in fluorescence-guided surgery although tumor detectability is not very good and optical technology is still evolving (55).",

Along with innovation in fluorescent agent development, there is a parallel path of innovation in the field of instrumentation that will extend the traditional view of surgery. Although these advances in FMI navigation have the potential to improve the surgical paradigm, there is the remaining challenge of defining clinical end points that will most benefit surgeons and patients utilizing these molecular navigation techniques. Minimally invasive surgical techniques have altered surgical practices in a way that coincides with and complements these promising technological advances. Minimally invasive surgical modalities have limited the handling of tissues, forcing surgeons to rely more heavily on tissue visualization. For open surgeries, real time improvement in visual differentiation between dissimilar tissue types during surgery will be particularly advantageous. With the development of imaging techniques and contrasts, FMI method can provide powerful assistance to theranostics for patients. Significant advances in intraoperative imaging-guided cancer surgery are expected in the next few years.",

            "text": "Radiation plays a critical role in the treatment of vaginal and vulvar cancer, either as definitive treatment or as part of a multimodal approach to management [7,13,[15][16][17][18]. A recent retrospective study by Yang et al. including 124 patients with vaginal cancers of varying stages was conducted to analyze clinical characteristics and survival of patients with primary vaginal cancers treated with various modalities, and demonstrated no difference in progression-free survival or disease-specific survival for patients treated with primary radiation compared to primary surgery for stage I-IVA disease [13]. It is important to note that given the proximity of the vagina to the bladder, rectum, and urethra, surgical intervention is often associated with significant morbidity [19,20]. As such, although the study by Yang et al. reported similar outcomes with the use of primary surgery or radiation, definitive radiation, either with or without chemotherapy, is often pursued in an attempt to avoid the toxicity associated with surgery. Within radiation treatments available, the inclusion of BT has been associated with improved outcomes in several studies [15,[21][22][23]. \n\nSeveral studies have been performed on the use of IGBT in vaginal cancers with promising results [8,11,[24][25][26]. A study by Manuel et al. examining the use of IGBT compared to BT without image-guidance for the treatment of vaginal cancer, showed improved 2-year local control (93% vs. 71%, p = 0.03) and disease-free interval (86% vs. 54%, p = 0.04) with IGBT. This study also demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in G3 genitourinary toxicity (0% vs. 22%, p = 0.002) in IGBT group compared to patients treated without IGBT [11].",

            "text": "Colorectal cancer ranks as the third most common cancer type in men and the second in women. 1 Radical surgery stands as the sole curative treatment option. However, even when undergoing radical resection, the prognosis for locally advanced colon cancer remains unfavorable. The integration of surgery with other treatment modalities may improve outcomes. Several advanced gastrointestinal malignancies, such as rectal cancer, exhibit favorable responses to preoperative (neoadjuvant) treatment. Initial studies on locally advanced colon cancer have also indicated positive outcomes with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. 2,3 The onset of lymph node metastases characterizes locally advanced colon cancer, underscoring the significance of accurate staging. Utilizing computed tomography (CT), one can assess the entire chest, pelvis, and abdomen in a single examination, facilitating the evaluation of both distant metastases and local staging. \n\nResearch has revealed that lymph nodes with a short axis measurement exceeding 8 mm are highly indicative of metastatic lymph nodes. 4,5 Conversely, numerous metastatic lymph nodes possess a diameter of less than 5 mm, and some benign lymph nodes exceed 5 mm in diameter. 6,7 Consequently, size alone does not serve as an optimal criterion to distinguish between benign and metastatic lymph nodes. \n\nIn contemporary clinical practice, radiological images are procured digitally. Texture analysis within a digital image pertains to the distribution of gray level values among pixels. Computed tomography texture analysis (CTTA) is a quantitative analytical method that provides more detailed data on the region of interest (ROI) than can be obtained through visual inspection alone. Microscopic biological changes can lead to tissue heterogeneity, and texture analysis can assess this tumor heterogeneity. Tumor heterogeneity is associated with necrosis, high cell density, and bleeding. The histogram is among the commonly used texture parameters. 8 A gray-level intensity histogram, utilizing all pixel values, provides first-order statistical information about an image. This information included the standard deviation of the histogram, mean gray level intensity, minimum, median, and maximum intensity values, percentile values of the histogram, variance, range, skewness, kurtosis, entropy, and uniformity values. 9",

These referenced studies have been conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (1964) and the protocols of these studies have been approved by the relevant ethics committees related to the institution in which they were performed. All human subjects, in these referenced studies, gave informed consent to participate in these studies. The application of this 'Cinderella' modality has been successful in the management of several cancers including head and neck, skin, brain, lung, pancreas, intra-peritoneal, breast and prostate. In addition, PDT was proven to be extremely successful in treating vascular anomalies. It is fundamental to the success of PDT that tumour margins are accessed and illuminated and the depth of necrosis is greater than the depth of each individual tumour (adequate treatment margin). In interstitial PDT, imaging can simply guide the optical fibres to the appropriate disease volume, which can be co-registered with a treatment volume allowing accurate assessment of delivered treatment doses. Image guidance also allows the guidance of delivery apparatus away from vital structures that may not have been otherwise palpable, i.e. arteries and nerves. It also ensures the parallel placement of delivery needles, enabling improved dosage administration profiles because the surface orientation of the needles is not a reliable measure of their deeper course, which may have been distorted by changes in tissue consistency or architecture (i.e. bone, tendons). \n\nA multi-disciplinary team of surgeons/physicians trained in PDT, medical physicists and interventional radiologists) working together is essential to the efficient modern management of deep-seated disease, especially with end-stage or locally advanced disease. The concept of disease treatment has evolved and important considerations such as disease margin or host tumour interface are a significant factor in the eventual outcome. PDT is well tolerated and effective especially for end-stage carcinomas, sarcomas and vascular anomalies. \n\nIt is expected that response and outcome will vary between different pathologies, depending on the structure, volume and severity of the pathology. Additionally, it is worth acknowledging that for the same grade of the same disease, there is variability in patients' responses to PDT.",

            "text": "The results of our staging work-ups showed localized disease that is usually treated surgically. However, after weighing the risks and benefits of surgery on an elderly person with extremely poor lung function, we believed that nonsurgical therapy would be safer and opted to use SBRT. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the successful use of SBRT to treat localized PC. \n\nRecently, Ersek et al. 6 reporting an analysis of the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results (SEER) for PC, found that surgical resection alone had better survival than other treatment modalities or combination therapies for this disease. Furthermore, another study, also using SEER database, sought to identify the prognostic factors and determine optimal treatment for PC. 7 That study found the factors male gender, age, T4 stage, M1 stage, surgery, and chemotherapy to be independently associated with PC survival. If we considered the two SEER analyses together without more investigation, the standard treatment for managing pulmonary carcinosarcoma with localized disease would undoubtedly be surgical resection. However, chemotherapy or radiotherapy is preferred over surgical resection for the treatment of advanced stage PC, making survival outcome inherently poor and possibly explaining their reported differences in survival outcome in those studies. In addition, the authors of the former SEER analysis 6 suggested that because radiotherapy may be performed less in the localized stage PC patients who potentially prefer operative therapy. It is not known what the precise dosage of delivered radiotherapy was to the patients across the long timespan of the survey (1973-2012). \n\nSBRT has become an effective treatment modality for medically or surgically inoperable lung cancer, and in one study, it has proven to provide superior survival benefit to the conventional fractionated radiotherapy. 8 Over the past decade, more clinicians have become aware of SBRT and have begun using it more often to treat early-stage lung cancer in both medically inoperable and operable patients. 9,10 It has also been used to treat much older patients (>80 years old) with high efficacy and tolerable toxicities. 11,12 Therefore, the potential benefit of SBRT in medically inoperable patients with PC should not be underestimated.",

They used cause-specific survival as an outcome to compare these modalities. Patients with stage I gastric cancer who were treated with surgery alone had better five-year cause-specific survival as compared to multimodality treatment while patients with stage II and beyond benefited more from multimodality treatment. On the other hand, in their subgroup analysis, patients with stage IB gastric adenocarcinoma who had multimodality treatment had better cause-specific survival compared to those who had surgery alone. Their conclusion should be taken with caution since patients who had multimodality treatment were the second youngest group in their study, which could confound the outcome. Moreover, additional variables that could affect the survival outcome were not considered, such as the number of lymph nodes examined during the surgery and histological subtypes. Furthermore, the SEER database doesn't provide accurate information regarding the timing of chemotherapy and radiation therapy relative to the surgery. In addition, chemotherapy data are categorized as either \"yes -patient had chemotherapy\" or \"no/unknown -no evidence of chemotherapy was found in the medical records examined.\" Finally, although cause-specific survival would provide reliable information about the effectiveness of the treatment, it doesn't account for the treatment toxicity effect, especially that many patients with gastric cancer are diagnosed in advanced age, which makes them more prone to treatment side effects. Therefore, overall survival would provide more reliable data regarding the effectiveness and the suitability of treatment.\n\nNational Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines do not recommend adjuvant chemotherapy routinely following R0 resection for T2N0M0 gastric adenocarcinoma. However, it is recommended for high-risk patients, those with vascular, lymphatic, and perineural invasion, poorly differentiated or high-grade tumors, and those under the age of 50 [8]. Our analysis showed that age more than 60 years, inadequate lymphadenectomy with less than 15 lymph nodes removed at the time of the surgery, tumor location within the cardia and fundus of the stomach, and non-Hispanic whites",

Furthermore, it would be an acceptable option for reducing surgical morbidity by avoiding combined therapy.\n\nAmong the risk factors that require additional therapy after surgery, tumor size is the only risk factor that could be precisely measured by clinical imaging studies before surgery without a pathologic report, while the other factors are determined pathologically after radical hysterectomy. Thus, we selected tumor size for predicting adjuvant treatment status. Among the diagnostic imaging tools, MRI has 90% sensitivity, 98% specificity, and up to 95% accuracy for stage IB or higher with primary tumors over 1 cm in size. [21][22][23] Other imaging studies including ultrasound, CT, and positron emission tomography based on local resources provide comparable information but have limitations, especially in the detection of the primary tumor and parametrial involvement. 24 25 There are several strengths of this study. First, we regrouped all patients based on the new 2018 FIGO system. Second, it enhances counseling when suggesting treatment options of primary surgery or chemoradiation based on their tumor size for stage IB2 cervical cancer patients, as there is no high-certainty evidence between treatment options. Finally, we measured the tumor size in most patients using MRI which has high accuracy. Ideally, with the availability of non-invasive diagnostic imaging tools, it may be possible to recommend appropriate treatment options avoiding combination therapies. Limitations of the current study include its retrospective nature, the lack of data on toxicities associated with adjuvant radiotherapy, and the small number of patients. Further randomized trials are required to explore the survival impact and local control rate of different treatment modalities based on the revised stage 1B2 cervical cancer.\n\nStage IB2 cervical cancer can be treated successfully in most patients with",

From the number of lymph nodes and postoperative outcomes, the technique demonstrates good performance, suggesting potential advantages in surgical efficacy and postoperative recovery. It is a technique worthy of attention (69). Data indicate that preoperative RT significantly benefits patients treated with non-TME-only surgery in terms of LR and OS (Figures 9, 10). Clinically, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy has become the standard treatment for LARC, achieving a high anal sphincter preservation rate. In some reports, this preservation rate can reach as high as 85.2%. However, the ultimate success of preserving the anal sphincter is also influenced by factors such as tumor location, stage, the patient's physical condition, and other variables. According to the literature, further investigations have been conducted into the potential clinical application of deep learning algorithms for the classification and diagnosis of CRC histopathology images. The advancements made possible by deep learning algorithms have the potential to improve the accuracy and efficacy of CRC detection (70,71). In recent decades, different RT regimens, including LCCRT and SCRT, have been applied to treat LARC. CRT tends to yield better survival outcomes than RT alone in certain types of cancers. A few trials have reported that LCCRT yielded a higher rate of pCR, lower LR rates, and reduced T and N stages compared to SCRT (72, 73). The impact of different RT regimens on OS was analyzed. Preoperative RT alone, preoperative CRT, preoperative LCCRT, and preoperative SCRT all benefit patients treated with non-TME-only surgery in terms of OS (Figure 10). Therefore, preoperative RT is essential for patients with completely resected middle and low LARC. The data here show that postoperative RT did not improve OS (Figure 4). This suggests that postoperative RT may not be necessary for all patients with completely resected LARC. Postoperative RT may be cautiously recommended for selected high-risk patients.",

            "text": "The early history of cancer treatments is littered with examples of initial successes leading to more aggressive, higher dosage or sustained procedures which subsequently failed to deliver improved outcomes. Surgery was the first natural treatment for cancer and was increasingly radical, especially after the availability of anaesthesia, but unfortunately this had little or no impact on local or distal spread. 1 While surgery is still the most effective modality of cancer treatment, the trend has become for more conservative interventions that retain organs and structures with associated improved body functions. Even 40 years ago, the radical mastectomies being performed on patients with breast cancer left women with deformities of the chest wall. Since then a better understanding of the patterns and likelihood of spread have allowed the use of less-mutilating simple mastectomy or simple excision followed by radiotherapy. Although combining low-volume surgery with radiotherapy was initially ridiculed by 'radicalistic' surgeons, a randomized trial organized by Bernard Fischer, to much contemporary resistance, showed that there was no benefit from radical surgery in terms of survival, recurrence or mortality, compared with local excision plus radiotherapy, in spite of the dreadful morbidity of the radical procedure. 2,3 While radiotherapy can successfully treat local lesions it has no effect on metastatic disease outside the treatment area. The underlying principle derives from the likelihood that most tumour cells divide faster than normal cells, although given the heterogeneity of cancer, this is not always the case. Importantly, radiation given at high doses causes ulceration, bone necrosis and marrow failure, limiting its capacity for delivering high cure rates. A therapeutic window can be exploited as the dose-response curves of the probability of tumour control and the occurrence of late effects in normal tissues using animal models show a higher threshold in normal tissues. In practice, small differences in dose in the therapeutic range can significantly affect the probability of cure and also the incidence of normal tissue injury. 4 Extensive research has provided the knowledge base to continue to optimize tumour control and limit normal tissue injury after radiotherapy. Modern linear accelerators allow precise dose delivery to the shape of the tumour with conformal options able to deliver the dose in three dimensions, killing the cancer but avoiding sensitive normal tissues. Brachytherapy and fractionation of external beam therapy have been optimized for the management of",

After testing different combinations of multi-modality treatment, the standard of care in LACC is still concurrent chemoradiotherapy followed by a 3D image-guided brachytherapy boost. Salvage hysterectomy is only feasible in a small proportion of patients with LACC. (Neo-)adjuvant treatment strategies for cervical cancer, according to the FIGO 2018 classification, are illustrated in Figure 1. Clinical trials of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy plus surgery in FIGO IB-IIB diseases demonstrated the detrimental treatment outcome of such a combination, compared with upfront chemoradiotherapy plus brachytherapy. The OUTBACK Trial in FIGO stage IB-IVA cervical cancers showed that adjuvant chemotherapy after concomitant chemoradiotherapy did not improve overall survival. The INTERLACE study is testing the induction chemotherapy by paclitaxel and carboplatin before standard chemoradiation. The success of immunotherapy is increasing, with a high level of evidence that patients' outcomes are improved at the metastatic stage.

However, the choice between surgery and RT has been debated for decades. Even though patient selection bias for each modality inherently exists in the retrospective study, this study aimed to compare the oncologic outcomes of the actual treatment of these patients between surgery-based treatment and RT.Materials and Method The medical records of 417 patients with T1\u2013T2N0 glottic squamous cell carcinoma were reviewed who were treated at our institution between 1995 and 2014. The patients were divided into two groups; primarily surgery-based treatment (OP, n=209) or RT (n=208).Results In the T1 stage, local failure, overall survival (OS), and disease-free survival (DFS) rates were not different between the OP and RT groups. However, in the T2 stage, the local failure rate was higher in the RT group (p<0.01). OS and DFS were higher in the OP group (p=0.019 and p=0.004, respectively). Larynx-preservation rate was similar in both groups (97.1% and 96.2%, p=0.576). Multivariate analysis showed that age (>65), presence of multiple primary cancer, and treatment modality were significant variables influencing OS and DFS.Conclusion Surgery-based treatment provided better local control rates, DFS, and OS in patients with T1\u2013T2N0 glottic SCC. In the T1 stage, treatment outcomes were similar between OP and RT groups. In the T2 stage, OP showed better results than RT, suggesting that refined strategies are required to improve the oncologic outcomes of RT for T2 glottic cancer.",

            "text": "The remarkable evolution of breast cancer surgery from the radical mastectomy advocated by William Halsted to cosmetically appealing breast conservation has been championed by women and pioneering surgeons, 1 and the safety and benefits of this approach have ultimately been confirmed through high-level scientific evidence. Randomized trials and subsequent experience with breast-conservation therapy (local excision and radiotherapy) have clearly established its efficacy, with a low, long-term risk of local (in-breast) recurrence, typically 0.5% to 1% per year. The increasing adoption of performing preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans in women newly diagnosed with early stage (stage I and II) breast cancer, for the purpose of identifying additional (occult) foci of disease within the affected breast, has been based on assumptions that MRI's detection capability in this setting will improve surgical treatment (and, hence, outcomes) in the absence of evidence of incremental clinical benefit. These assumptions, which are further discussed in relation to available evidence, are that: (1) preoperative MRI will improve surgical planning (or precision), thus leading to a reduction in re-excision surgery, and (2) MRI will reduce in-breast recurrences by guiding surgical intervention for MRI-detected additional disease. \n\nEmerging data show that this approach to local staging of the breast leads to more women being treated with mastectomy without improvement in surgical outcomes or prognosis. Thus, it is timely and imperative to consider both current evidence and a way forward in determining the role of preoperative MRI. We review the data on breast MRI in women newly affected by breast cancer, highlighting the evidence on its potential benefit and associated harm, and discuss implications for management of women with early stage disease. We systematically discuss each of the key issues relevant to addressing the clinical question raised in the title of our article, based on summaries of published data, complemented by our perspectives on the evidence in the context of contemporary standards of care in breast cancer.",

Because radical surgery, especially the procedures performed in patients with advanced T-stage diseases, may cause significant swallowing and phonatory dysfunctions, there has been a clear paradigm shift from radical surgery to organ-preserving CCRT for HPSCC treatment in recent decades. 3,4  he main concern of such an organ-preserving approach is whether definitive CCRT could provide comparable treatment outcomes compared with OP-CRT. Reviewing the literature, only two randomized control trials compared the treatment outcomes between surgerybased and radiation-based modalities before the popularity of CCRT. 8,9 Unexpectedly, in the contemporary era of CCRT, no randomized trial has been conducted specifically on HPSCC patients to compare the treatment outcome between OP-CRT and CCRT. 6 Retrospective studies that directly compared the outcome between CCRT and OP-CRT in HPSCC patients are also limited. 6,10 The optimal management of HPSCC patients remains to be established. \n\nThus, this study provides our long-term experiences in treating HPSCC patients, comparing the survival outcomes and failure patterns between CCRT and OP-CRT treatment.",

            "text": "Surgery resection is the first-line treatment for colorectal cancer (CRC), which is the most common malignant tumor of the digestive system worldwide. 1 Unfortunately, 20%-30% of CRC patients are in the advanced stage, which cannot be easily rooted out through surgery. In addition, postoperative metastasis and recurrence severely affect patient survival. 2 Currently, systemic radiotherapy and chemotherapy are the common intervention managements for preventing local tumor recurrence and distance metastasis after surgery. However, both radiotherapy and chemotherapy usually cause serious side effects and destroy immune systems, which limit their efficacy in prolonging patients' overall survival. 3 Notably, surgery produces a transient immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment associated with wound healing, which leads to tumor cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and even immune escape. 4 Therefore, it is urgent to develop new technologies to deal with postsurgery tumor recurrence and metastasis in CRC. \n\nCancer immunotherapy represented by immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has held new promise for CRC treatment. 5 For example, the anti-programmed cell death receptor-1 antibody (anti-PD-1 Ab) has been approved for high microsatellite instability (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficiency (d MMR) in advanced CRC. 6 However, only approximately 5% of CRC patients have the characteristics of MSI-H/d MMR. \n\nMost CRC patients have a low response rate to ICB, mainly because tumors lack immunogenicity and immunosuppressive microenvironment. 7 [11] Photothermal therapy is a noninvasive means of cancer therapy, during which tumor tissues are ablated by the thermal effect of nearinfrared (NIR) light-absorbing materials that can convert photon energy to heat to kill tumor cells. 12 Compared to other traditional treatments, PTT has already showed plenty of merits such as noninvasiveness, better controllability, and low incidence of complication. 13",

Prostate cancer is the 6 th most common type of cancer worldwide and the 2 nd most predominant in men, accounting for about 10% of all cancer cases 1 . \n\nThe optimum treatment of localized prostate cancer stays debatable. There are three main options of treatment; surgery, radiotherapy (external beam radiotherapy or brachytherapy) and hormonal therapy 2 . Radiation therapy is one of the main lines of treatment in early, locally advanced and even metastatic prostate cancer. In the new era of advanced radiotherapy techniques such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), several trials have documented its excellent results especially in the treatment of prostate cancer. IMRT permits dose escalation with high conformity and high dose to the prostate and while sparing normal tissues such as the bladder and rectum [2][3][4] . Moreover, IMRT results were much better as regards toxicity in comparison to three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) technique plans [5][6][7] . Therefore, IMRT is being increasingly used in the treatment of prostate cancer. \n\nVarious modalities of IMRT delivery systems have been developed, such as linear accelerator based-IMRT systems, the Tomotherapy\u00ae system (Hi-Art system, Accuray Inc., Madison, WI, USA), the RapidArc system (Varian Medical System Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA), the volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) system (Elekta Instrument AB Stockholm), and the CyberKnife system (Accuray Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA), and proton systems. \n\nDosimetric studies have compared treatment plans using different IMRT modalities in patients with prostate cancer [8][9][10][11][12] . The dosimetric outcome differed when comparing plans using RapidArc and the VMAT in comparison to IMRT in the treatment of prostate cancer 13-24   .",

            "text": "Comparisons were made between the defined age groups in three different domains. In the first domain, we compared the clinical characteristics of the entire cohort of patients between the three age groups. The distribution of symptomology, body mass index (BMI) and pre-treatment carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels were compared. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status was determined at the time of initial medical or radiation oncology consultation. Patients cancer stage was established using the framework in the eighth edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging manual. Tumour distance from the anal verge (FAV) was measured from the caudal extremity of the rectal mass to the anal opening established through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis pre-treatment.\n\nThe second domain explored treatment approaches looking first and foremost at the proportion of patients who underwent surgery and the type of surgery undertaken. For those that did not undergo surgery, the treatment modality consisting of palliative chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy or no treatment was specified. Patients that underwent curative surgical resections were then analysed for any pathological differences between tumours in each age group. The amount of regional lymph nodes retrieved intraoperatively and involvement of the margin of the resected specimen were used as surrogates for the robustness of surgery. Histological grade, the presence of lymphovascular invasion or perineural invasion and tumour size were determined upon evaluation by the treating pathologist. Receipt of adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemo-or radiotherapy was then compared. The specific chemoradiotherapy regimens were guided by local protocols and agreed upon by members of the MDT.\n\nFinally, the primary outcomes were examined and included overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS) and disease-free survival (DFS) measured throughout the follow up period. Analyses of the former two survival measures included the entire cohort of patients, whereas DFS only included patients who underwent curative treatment. OS was defined as the interval from the time of diagnosis to the time of death or censored at the last follow up if the patient was alive. CSS was defined as the interval from the time of diagnosis to the time of cancer-related",

            "text": "In particular, a significantly higher RFS rate was achieved in patients with tumors that invaded the submucosa. However, before concluding that surgery is the most appropriate treatment for cT1 esophageal cancer, it should be noted that the authors did not distinguish patients who underwent RT only from patients who underwent CCRT. Considering that the RT alone group showed an inferior result in our paper, the results of Matsumoto's study are considered to be similar to the results of our study. The outcome of CCRT was superior to that of RT alone in esophageal cancer according to a previous prospective randomized trial. 12 Therefore, we propose that CCRT should be in an equal position rather than considered a simple alternative treatment, based on the results of those studies and other favorable data supporting RT. 13,14 After esophagectomy, 35 patients were diagnosed with pathological T1a disease, but not T1b. When the outcome of the esophagectomy group was excluded except for these patients, it showed a poorer outcome than before, which is probably to be expected. This outcome was not statistically significant when compared with those of the other groups. In other words, the significant differences observed in RFS for the RT alone group disappeared and showed an inferior tendency, although not significantly so, compared with the CCRT group. However, in the CCRT and RT alone groups, T1b disease was diagnosed using EUS, but there were actually patients with T1a disease in the group. Therefore, it is difficult to conclude that esophagectomy is inferior to CCRT. \n\nWhen we performed multivariate analysis in this study, the factors significantly associated with OS were age, T stage, and treatment modality. T stage has been reported as a significant factor in several studies; 1,15 treatment modality could also be a significant factor because there was a difference in the baseline characteristics according to treatment modality, which was related to T stage. Conversely, there might be no significant difference in OS according to treatment modality when patients with the same stage disease are analyzed. Other studies have shown that T stage, age, facility, and follow-up frequency in early-stage esophageal cancer are significantly associated with outcome. 15,16",

            "text": "Extrahepatic biliary tract cancers (EBCs) are rare, with a reported annual diagnostic rate of 12,000 in the USA [1]. It includes perihilar cholangiocarcinoma, bile duct, gallbladder, and distal or ampullary cancers. Compared to intrahepatic biliary tract cancers, they are more common and tend to cause symptoms more often. However, clinical differentiation of the types is unreliable since most of these cancers will cause mass-like lesions and lead to obstruction of the biliary tract. Surgical treatment, whether radical or limited/palliative, varies according to the location [2,3]. \n\nOver the last two decades, there have been shifts in the diagnostic and treatment modalities for cancer. The effects of new diagnostic tools and treatment approaches are reflected in the outcome objectives of treatment, which favor early/accurate detection and less aggressive procedures, including robotic and laparoscopic surgery. Early detection potentially leads to less radical procedures and better outcomes. Implementation of minimally invasive surgery for biliary cancers at the early stages, as for several other cancers, has increased over the years for several reasons [4,5]. Studies have shown that minimally invasive approaches are associated with less postoperative pain, shorter length of stay, and faster recovery time [6]. \n\nDiagnosing biliary cancers at an early stage will potentially increase survival rates by enabling less aggressive surgical treatment for localized diseases. In addition, the continuously improving surgical technology available for diagnostic workup and intervention, including imaging modalities and endoscopy with tissue acquisition capabilities, may enhance earlier detection. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate EBC trends over 13 years, including early detection, the extent of surgical treatment, and the surgical approaches.",

            "text": "Cancer poses a grave global challenge, jeopardizing the lives and well-being of individuals across the globe. Recent data from the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a division of the World Health Organization, reveals alarming statistics: in 2020 alone, there were 19.29 million newly diagnosed cancer cases and a staggering 9.96 million cancer-related deaths worldwide [1]. Cancer has consistently remained one of the most intricate and challenging human diseases, often referred to as a 'terminal illness'. Consequently, the advancement of cutting-edge medical technologies in tumor treatment has emerged as a pivotal area demanding urgent breakthroughs. Addressing this pressing need has become a primary direction for development, holding immense significance for the field of medicine. \n\nTraditional methods for cancer treatment encompass surgical intervention, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. Among them, surgery is currently the preferred approach for managing tumors, particularly in early stage cancer. However, as cancer progresses to advanced stages, surgical procedures only offer palliative benefits or life extension and do not eradicate the cancer. Furthermore, the trauma induced during tumor surgery may stimulate the growth and metastasis of cancerous tissue [2]. Radiation therapy involves the targeted application of radiation to eliminate tumor cells. However, this approach also affects surrounding healthy cells or tissues, leading to significant side effects. Hence, radiation therapy is typically combined with chemotherapy to enhance its effectiveness [3]. Chemotherapy utilizes chemical drugs to systemically treat tumors, exhibiting the therapeutic efficacy against both primary and metastatic lesions. Despite its significant treatment outcomes, the administration of high doses of drugs can cause harm to the body, with more effective treatments often accompanied by greater toxic side effects [4]. In recent years, ablation therapy has emerged as a rapidly evolving treatment modality, incorporating techniques such as radiofrequency ablation [5], microwave ablation [6], and cryoablation [7]. These methods offer promising alternatives to conventional treatments. The treatment method involves the application of various heat sources to the tumor region using minimally invasive treatment needles, leading to the destruction of adjacent tumor tissues. This approach exhibits minimal side effects and avoids drug resistance. However, when treating tissues near blood vessels, there is a possibility of \"heat deposition\" that may affect the treatment outcome and potentially result in sequelae.",

            "text": "Lung cancer is the most common cancer type worldwide [1]. Two main histological classes of lung cancer exist: small-cell lung carcinomas (SCLCs) and non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs). Surgical resection is the cornerstone in the curative-intended treatment of non-disseminated NSCLCs [2]. The primary goal in surgical oncology treatment is to achieve a complete resection of the tumor (R0). Incomplete surgical resection of the tumor (R1 or R2) occurs in 2.8-12.7% of patients and is associated with significantly worse survival and higher recurrence rates [3][4][5][6]. In the past, lung resections were mostly performed via thoracotomy. To improve recovery and postoperative pain, there has been a shift from open to minimally invasive surgery (video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery and robotic-assisted thoracoscopic surgery) [7]. A limitation of these surgical techniques is reduced tactile feedback. With the advent of lung cancer screening programs, it is expected that in the near future, more resections will be performed for small nodules, which can be hard to identify during (minimally invasive) surgery [8]. These small-size pulmonary nodules can be operated on with lung-parenchyma-sparing operations (i.e., segmentectomy), with good clinical and oncological outcomes [9]. There is a need for improved preoperative and/or intraoperative imaging techniques to both localize lung nodules and guarantee R0 resections. \n\nVarious preoperative techniques facilitating image-guided localization of pulmonary nodules during surgical resection have been described. This includes several computed tomography (CT)-guided modalities, such as 3D planning, preoperative placement of hook wires, microcoils, fiducials, or radiotracers [10][11][12][13]. These techniques can help in localizing the lesion but commonly have insufficient resolution to determine resection margins.",

            "text": "Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for more than 80% of all lung cancers (1). Although there are various treatment modalities, surgery is a radical treatment for patients with IIIA NSCLC, with only a small percentage of patients treated surgically. This is because most patients are diagnosed with locally advanced or metastatic disease, and patients who receive surgery alone are prone to subsequent local recurrence and distant metastasis. Therefore, multidisciplinary sequential therapies are considered the optimal treatment regimen (2). For patients with operable stage IIIA-N2 NSCLC, treatments recommended in AJCC are surgery plus PORT or concurrent chemoradiotherapy (3). The combination treatment standard is widely used, and previous studies have repeatedly proven that PORT, as a part of standard treatments, can prevent local recurrence. However, it is still inconclusive whether PORT can improve OS and prevent serious adverse effects even death in patients with IIIA-N2. In a single-center, randomized, controlled study published in JAMA in 2021, 364 patients with IIIAN2 were divided into control and postoperative radiotherapy groups. Results suggest that PORT did not improve median DFS(hazard ratio [HR], 0.84; 95% CI, 0.65-1.09; P = 0.20) (4). In the 2020 ESMO conference: The Lung ART study showed that PORT had similar results in DFS (3-year: 47.1% vs. 43.8%; P = 0.16) or OS (3-year: 66.5% vs. 68.5%; HR, not provided yet) in patients with pIIIA-N2 NSCLC. Not only that, the PORT group had a higher rate of grade 3-4 toxicities and more deaths from cardiopulmonary complications (2.0% vs 16.2%) (5).\n\nEven though there were positive conclusions in other studies. For example, a study of the National Cancer Database which identified 4,483 patients with N2 NSCLC after complete resection and adjuvant chemotherapy. PORT was associated with an increase in median (45.2 vs. 40.7 months) and 5",

            "text": "Early-stage glottic carcinomas can be treated with either laser surgery or radiotherapy. Both approaches have demonstrated similar cure rates. However, the question of which modality is superior in terms of voice outcomes remains a topic of debate.\n \n \n In our study, we conducted a comparison of short-term phonatory outcomes in patients with primary early glottic cancer who underwent treatment using both modalities. We assessed these outcomes using videostroboscopy and voice analysis software at three time points: immediately following treatment, at 1\u00a0month, and at 3\u00a0months post-treatment.\n \n \n Voice analysis revealed that laser surgery had a more favorable immediate effect compared to radiotherapy in parameters such as jitter, shimmer, harmonics-to-noise ratio, and fundamental frequency. However, at the 3-month post-treatment mark, both treatment modalities demonstrated similar effects. Additionally, both modalities had comparable effects on maximum phonation time. Videostroboscopy observations showed that mucosal wave forms were more prominent immediately after laser surgery and gradually improved following radiotherapy. Furthermore, patients with incomplete glottic closure experienced recovery after both treatment modalities.\n \n \n Based on the results, there are better outcomes immediately following LS compared to RT. However, after a 3-month period, the outcomes of both treatment modalities become comparable. The treating physicians must consider various factors such as complications, patient-specific considerations, treatment costs, and duration to make informed decisions. A personalized approach considering the individual patient\u2019s circumstances is crucial in achieving optimal results in the management of T1 laryngeal cancer.",

            "text": "Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a heterogeneous group of tumors that originate from the mucosal epithelium of head and neck, including the lip, oral cavity, larynx, and pharynx (excluding the nasopharynx). It is the most common type of head and neck cancer and the sixth leading cancer worldwide. In 2018, its incidence and mortality were reported to be 890,000 and 450,000, respectively. 1 However, hitherto, no effective screening method is available for HNSCC, and more than 50% of the cases were found to be locoregionally advanced (stage III-IV) at diagnosis. Surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy are the major treatment modalities for non-metastatic HNSCC. Surgery and radiotherapy are the mainstays in most cases. For high-risk patients who have undergone resection, postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy alone or chemoradiotherapy is recommended. Considering individual differences in response to radiotherapy, the optimal criteria for treatment decisions remained unestablished. However, individual differences in radiosensitivity greatly limit the therapeutic effect of radiation. Therefore, current treatment plans might be inadequate for the management of radioresistant HNSCC. Furthermore, since radiotherapy has deleterious effects on adjacent normal organs and tissues, which might impair phonation or swallowing, it might not be the optimal choice for radioresistant HNSCC patients. Recently, radiotherapy techniques have improved greatly. The advent of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) has resulted in a better dose-volume distribution and greatly reduced toxicities. However, compared with two-dimensional radiotherapy or three-dimensional conventional radiotherapy, IMRT did not achieve better recurrence-free survival (RFS), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS). 2 Under such circumstances, increasing the strength of combinatory treatment modalities or switching to other treatment modalities might be necessary. Thus, considering radiosensitivity during treatment decisions is necessary for choosing the optimal curative and safe approach.",

            "text": "Although treatments were historically planned using twodimensional films and the point-based Manchester system in the United States and Europe, technical advances have led to increased use of CT or MRI for three-dimensional volumetric planning. 26 MRI provides a much better definition of tissues, allowing adaptive planning as the tumor regresses with each delivered fraction. In 2005, the Groupe Europeen de Curietherapie and the European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology (GEC-ESTRO) published guidelines for optimal MRI-guided brachytherapy planning target volumes. 27 The total prescription dose is the combined external beam and brachytherapy biologically effective dose delivered in 2 Gy fractions (EQD2). Image-guided brachytherapy improves local control and reduces normal tissue toxicity. In 2012, the French STIC trial, 28 the first prospective, non-randomized trial to compare twodimensional versus three-dimensional brachytherapy in treating locally advanced cervical cancer, showed that three-dimensional brachytherapy was feasible and safe in routine practice. It improved local control with half the toxicity observed with two-dimensional dosimetry. In 2017, the American Brachytherapy Task Group 29 reported a pooled analysis of clinical outcomes for high-dose-rate brachytherapy for cervical cancer, which showed an improvement in outcomes with the use of image-guided brachytherapy compared with traditional point A dose prescriptions, and demonstrated that high-dose-rate brachytherapy is a safe, effective modality when combined with image-guided brachytherapy. As reported in 2019, the international RetroEMBRACE study improved local control and reduced late toxicity for women with large tumors treated with image-guided brachytherapy relative to historical controls. 30 Early results of the prospective, multi-institutional EMBRACE study have identified improved dose-volume thresholds for urinary and rectal toxicity in women with locally advanced cervical cancer receiving MRI-guided brachytherapy. For patients with prominent irregularly shaped tumors, sufficient dose coverage is difficult to be achieved during whole dose constraint keeping organs at risk with the standard intracavitary brachytherapy. The therapeutic advantage of hybrid intracavitary and interstitial brachytherapy has been reported. 31 In the EMBRACE I study, concurrent chemoradiotherapy with MRI-based image-guided brachytherapy was effective and stable",

The current treatment modalities for OSCC are surgery with or without removal of lymph nodes by neck dissection, followed by radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. In cases of non-metastatic and early-stage disease, surgery remains the primary treatment approach. In contrast, patients with a later disease stage and with high risk of recurrence are treated with radiation therapy (RT) and/or chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in addition to surgery as an adjuvant approach (6). At times, patients who are unfit for surgery are given RT/CRT as the primary treatment modality (7). Systemic therapy involves usage of chemotherapeutic agents like docetaxel and cisplatin where surgery cannot be performed or in higher-stage cancers (8). Surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy are the first line of treatment methods for OSCC, but since last few years, immunotherapy has also come in power. In 2016, the U.S. food and drug administration (FDA) approved two PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors nivolumab (Opdivo) and pembrolizumab (Keytruda) to be used in the treatment of relapsed and refractory HNSCC, also few more antibodies against PD-1 have been approved for marketing in the US (9). Compared to other cancers, the 5-year survival rate of OSCC is poor, ranging approximately from 20% to 80% based on the stage at which the disease is diagnosed (10,11). However, the majority of the cases are diagnosed at a later stage, leading to an overall inferior outcome.",

            "text": "There is a lack of consensus with regard to the most appropriate radiation modality in treating intermediate-risk prostate cancer. Studies to date have demonstrated a relatively comparable rates of disease control and survival outcomes among the treatment modalities. We conducted a cost-utility analysis comparing different radiation techniques to guide our decision-making when treating this group of patients. In the absence of convincing data comparing the cost-utility studies in this area, an analysis was performed on a relative cost-utility based on the literature review of key studies on different radiation modalities. \n\nOur study that SBRT is the most cost-effective compared to other techniques that were evaluated. LDR-b yielded relatively similar results to SBRT overall, likely indicating additional evidence comparing these two treatments to determine any significant differences in costs and outcomes that would change this finding. More broadly, the probabilistic analysis showed that several of these modalities were comparable, making a clear treatment decision difficult. The close overlap of results is a consequence of several shared parameter values across all modalities having a wide confidence interval associated with them, such as cost of complications and the tight marginal differences in patient outcomes across several innovative treatments, leading to very similar toxicity outcomes. More intensive surveillance of patient outcomes across each modality would improve evidence precision that may clarify treatments' differences. Additionally, it is essential to acknowledge that some unique properties or patient requirements favor one of these treatments over SBRT under specific circumstances not captured in our model. However, it should be noted that the cost analysis of the SBRT technique used here is based on treating patients with conventional linear accelerator, which would be significantly less costly compared with other more advanced techniques, such as CyberKnife \u00ae (Accuray, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Treatment with CyberKnife \u00ae in this scenario would be at least three times more costly than conventional linear accelerator-based treatments according to cost per fraction calculation at our institution. \n\nThe result of our study might not be directly comparable to the existing evidence on the cost-effectiveness of prostate cancer treatments due to differences in the study perspective and treatment modalities being considered. Cooperberg et al. [9] conducted a comprehensive lifetime cost-utility analysis of localized prostate cancer treatment, including surgery.",

It is common practice to use a combination of these modalities to maximize clinical outcomes, which are often measured by a balance between maximizing tumor damage and minimizing normal tissue side effects due to treatment. However, multi-modality treatment policies are mostly empirical in current practice and are therefore subject to individual clinicians' experiences and intuition. We present a novel formulation of optimal multi-modality cancer management using a finite-horizon Markov decision process approach. Specifically, at each decision epoch, the clinician chooses an optimal treatment modality based on the patient's observed state, which we define as a combination of tumor progression and normal tissue side effect. Treatment modalities are categorized as (1) type 1, which has a high risk and high reward, but is restricted in the frequency of administration during a treatment course; (2) type 2, which has a lower risk and lower reward than type 1, but may be repeated without restriction; and (3) type 3, no treatment (surveillance), which has the possibility of reducing normal tissue side effect at the risk of worsening tumor progression. Numerical simulations using various intuitive, concave reward functions show the structural insights of optimal policies and demonstrate the potential applications of using a rigorous approach to optimizing multi-modality cancer management.",

            "text": "For young patients with smaller tumors, the fertility-sparing surgical approach is preferred over primary RT [5]. Surgical resection is also preferentially recommended in lower-middle-income countries where advanced imaging tools or RT modalities are not available [28]. However, primary RT is the first treatment option for patients with medical comorbidities that increase the risk associated with general anesthesia. In this study, we demonstrate that primary RT, as an initial definitive therapy, needs to be considered in clinical settings, where the administration of brachytherapy and chemotherapy is sufficiently feasible. \n\nThis study has several limitations. Despite the propensity score-adjusted analyses, potential selection bias was not completely eliminated in the retrospective design. The general medical condition could not be considered in the matching process due to the lack of information; thus, we mainly analyzed DSS data as the primary outcome of interest rather than overall survival. Further, detailed information on RT methods (total radiation dose, daily fraction size, extent of the radiation field, and techniques) or chemotherapy (regimen and cycles) was not available in the database. Technical aspects can affect the clinical outcomes of primary RT. Since the quality of RT methods was not confirmed, treatment benefits in the primary RT group might be partially underestimated in comparison with radical surgery. The appropriate or inappropriate administration of perioperative treatment after surgery was not assessed because the surgical margin status, such as R0, R1, and R2, was unknown. The sequence of the two treatments was not indicated in the database for the combined use of chemotherapy and primary RT. Recent advances in RT techniques were not partially reflected because some patients were treated a few decades ago. Nevertheless, the SEER program is a representative nationwide registry that allows access to large-scale real-world data in practice. \n\nIn this study, we evaluated the effectiveness and optimal use of primary RT as definitive therapy for non-bulky early-stage cervical cancer. Although hysterectomy led to better survival outcomes than RT in the overall study population, the survival difference was reduced and attenuated when the primary RT group was confined to patients treated with brachytherapy and chemotherapy.",

In Brazil, the NCCN is the most frequently used (70%), 22 thus during the period, patients with intermediate risk for local recurrence, i.e., perineural invasion, lymph-vascular invasion, and T3/T4 received adjuvant RT. Patients with the presence of positive margins, extracapsular extension or positive lymph node received adjuvant CRT. The results of surgical groups were similar to other studies reported in the literature. In a multicenter retrospective study including 176 patients with larynx cancer, 65 (37%) with clinical Stage III, 51 were submitted to organ-preserving treatment, and 14 underwent laryngectomy. 10 Of the 111 patients with clinical Stage IV, 42 were treated with non-surgical treatment and 69 underwent total laryngectomy. Overall survival at 3 years was 58% for Stage III and 42% for Stage IV. The choice of treatment did not influence the survival for Stages III (p = 0.56) and IV (p = 0.93). However, there was a trend towards bet-ter outcomes with surgical treatment, especially in patients with advanced disease. 10 Despite the incorporation of the concept of multimodality treatment, there is still considerable discussion regarding the optimal treatment strategies for patients with LAHNC. 12,17,20 Primary surgery has experienced a recent revival with the advent of newer surgical techniques and a better knowledge of tumor biology. 21 Although CRT in the last decades has increased its indication, some authors have questioned the organ preservation and survival of these patients with a long follow-up. 23 Evaluating our data, the survival achieved by CRT is comparable to the surgical group, independent of the adjuvant treatment employed. However, with a long follow-up (over 5 years), our data showed a tendency to lower survival in CRT. For us, this tendency is related to a more advanced age and stage in the CRT group.\n\nConsequently, when the treatment groups were placed in the multivariate analysis by the Cox estimator, there was a better",

            "text": "Radical removal of the primary rectal cancer and no local recurrence are prerequisites for cure, although occasional local recurrences can be salvaged by secondary surgery and (chemo)radiotherapy ((C)RT). Avoidance of persistent or recurrent tumour in the pelvis is important, even if cure cannot be achieved, since uncontrolled pelvic growth is usually associated with severe, disabling symptoms. Even if overall survival is not improved, improved local control is a legitimate outcome of different interventions in rectal cancer. \n\nAn important aim in rectal cancer is, thus, to treat so that the risk of residual disease in the pelvis is very low or preferably less than about 5% in the population in which curative treatment is intended. This should be possible in all but the few (\u00a310%) cases who  present with a fixed tumour growing into a not readily resectable organ (about half of those with cT4). At the same time, however, as little acute and late morbidity as possible should be aimed at. Surgery, particularly if extensive, may give substantial morbidity, and additional treatments, whether given pre-or postoperatively, increase morbidity. Thus, additional treatments should be chosen with care. \n\nFrom a practical point of view, rectal cancers can be divided into four groups: very early (some cT1), early (cT1-2, some cT3), intermediate (most cT3, some cT4), and locally advanced (some cT3, most cT4). Factors other than clinical T-stage are also relevant, such as tumour height, closeness to the mesorectal fascia (mrf), potentially the circumferential margin (crm) (preoperatively, the term mrf is better than crm, since the crm cannot be defined until after surgery ( 12)), nodal (cN)-stage, and vascular and nerve invasion. It is at present not possible to provide a precise description of which T and N substages belong to these groups.",

            "text": "New surgical techniques, such as extended lymphadenectomy including cephalad boundary at the aortic bifurcation or take off from the inferior mesenteric artery, which showed better outcomes were recently developed. 6 In a study of immune checkpoint inhibitors, patients who had only regional lymph node metastasis showed better outcomes than those with distant metastasis, but these groups presented tumors with different biological origins (urothelial cancer). In a previous observation cohort study, 5 subsets of patients with regional lymph node-positive bladder cancer showed durable disease control and long-term survival. Moreover, compared to single modality including palliative chemotherapy or surgery alone, combined modality treatments showed better outcomes. \n\nHowever, it is important to point out that this study has some limitations. The retrospective nature and observational study design lead to drawbacks including potential selection bias and unmeasured confounders, such as performance status indicator or other organ function parameters. In practice, the patients selected for combined radical cystectomy and chemotherapy would be generally fitter than the patients selected for palliative chemo or cystectomy only. \n\nPatients who received concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) for bladder cancer were excluded. In bladder cancer, CCRT could be considered as bladder preservation treatment in node-negative case if patients refused radical cystectomy or were not eligible for radical cystectomy. In a multicenter, randomized, phase three trial, combined CCRT showed better locoregional control than did radiotherapy alone for node-negative, muscle-invasive bladder cancer. 16 Chemoradiotherapy after transurethral resection of muscle-invasive, node-negative bladder cancer showed 72% complete response, 64% of 10-year local control, and 42% of 10-year disease-specific survival. 17 n clinical practice, as physicians encounter patients with bladder cancer of varying stages, a multidisciplinary approach for the initial diagnosis could be advised and a combined therapy strategy for the treatment of regional lymph node-positive bladder cancer should be considered. \n\nThis study showed that a combined therapy strategy to treat regional lymph node-positive bladder cancer had better outcomes than those of single therapy strategy.",

            "text": "In the present study, NAT was chosen by the multidisciplinary team to downstage the cancer depending on the biological subtype, with the aim of providing less invasive surgery, reducing postoperative complications, and improving cosmetic outcomes. The expanded use and improved efficacy of NAT for the management of triple-negative and HER2-positive breast cancer have led to increasing numbers of patients with no detectable residual disease at the time of surgery 38 . In such patients, a pCR is associated with a low risk of locoregional recurrence and better overall survival 8,9,22,38,39 . It was shown here that ultrasound-guided VABB, used in concert with other imaging modalities, can reliably identify a pCR in patients with triple-negative or HER2-positive breast cancer. Values in parentheses are 95% exact confidence intervals. The analysis included 50 patients: 22 with an imaging complete response (2 with residual disease at vacuum-assisted breast biopsy (VABB) and 20 with a complete response at VABB included in primary analysis) and 28 with residual disease at postneoadjuvant therapy imaging. *Three patients had missing information on MRI. \u2020Five patients had missing information on PET. \n\nIn recent decades, the widespread adoption of NAT has facilitated increased use of breast-conserving surgery, instead of mastectomy, with equivalent survival outcomes. Although breast-conserving surgery is a procedure with relatively low morbidity, it still affects quality of life. Approximately 30 per cent of patients who undergo breast-conserving surgery and SLN biopsy report moderate, persistent pain 2 years after surgery, and patients who have breast-conserving surgery and mastectomy report similarly lower quality of life up to 8 years after surgery 38 . \n\nIn 2017, the St Gallen International Breast Cancer Conference highlighted opportunities for de-escalation of breast cancer treatment on the basis of tumour stage and tumour biology 40 . The omission of surgery should be restricted to patients for whom no residual disease after NAT can be expected. Therefore, patients who have a high probability of a pCR, and for whom there is evidence of concordance between iCR and pCR, are appropriate candidates for trials that omit surgery.",

            "text": "Background\nSurgical resection is the standard of care for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), but only a minority of patients are managed surgically. Other modalities, including external beam radiation (XRT), radiofrequency ablation (RFA), and radioactive implants (RIs) have been employed with significant heterogeneity of prognosis reported in the literature. The aim of this study was to evaluate the demographics of patients with ICC managed non-surgically and compare prognosis in patients managed surgically to those that underwent XRT, RFA, or RI.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients diagnosed with ICC from 2004 to 2015 in the National Cancer Database (NCDB) were reviewed. Patient demographics, treatments, and survival outcomes were analyzed.\n\n\nResults\nOf the 6,140 patients with ICC, 4,374 (71%) did not undergo surgery. Patients managed non-surgically were typically older, treated at community centers, more likely to have severe fibrosis or cirrhosis, and present with higher stage disease. The strongest association to receipt of XRT, RI, or RFA modalities was treatment at an academic center. Increased clinical stage was associated with decreased use of RFA; a significantly higher proportion of patients with stage IV disease were given no local therapy. RFA associated with a statistically significant survival benefit over no local therapy only in stage I disease (2.1 vs. 0.7 years, P=0.012) as well as XRT over no local therapy (1.7 vs. 0.7 years, P=0.009). No survival benefit was realized for any treatment in stage II disease. Patients with stage III disease had a survival benefit from XRT versus no local therapy (0.9 vs. 0.6 years, P=0.029) and RI over no local therapy (1.2 vs. 0.6 years, P=0.013). Patients with stage IV disease only demonstrated survival benefit from RI over no local therapy (0.9 vs. 0.3 years, P=0.014).\n\n\nConclusions\nThe majority of patients with ICC in the United States continue to be managed non-surgically. RFA was associated with improved survival only in stage I disease. X",

            "text": "That means the false positive of FIGO 2018 staging was 43.9%, and indicated that if the CT or MRI suggestion of IIIc1r, almost half of cases would benefit from surgery with unnecessary radiation. MRI is a standard pre-treatment imaging modality for cervical cancer, while the accuracy of MRI for detection of nodal metastasis is not so well. The reported positive predictive value were 20-66% for CT scan, and 0-27% for MRI scan. The negative predictive values of the imaging techniques were 53-92% for CT scan, an 75-91% for MRI [20]. PET-CT performs better than CT and MRI while there is still 10% falsenegative rate [6][7]20]. Therefore these uncertainties may lead to some over treatment or insufficient cure problems in imaging-based concurrent CCRT. And surgery can provide accurate lymph node information and benefit patients with unnecessary radiation. \n\nCombined treatment is presumably associated with increased morbidity. However, in the present study, there were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of the grade III-IV myelosuppression incidence rates and grade III-IV gastrointestinal reactions. This was consistent with literature reports [19,[21][22]. Notably, treatment cost was higher for the surgery group than for the CCRT group (p = 0.001). \n\nSince stage IIIC1r is diagnosed by imaging, the accuracy of imaging plays a crucial role in staging. Regardless of whether MRI or PET-CT is used, false positives are inevitable. Surgery can help clarify the status of a patient's lymph nodes and thus guide subsequent treatment. In our study, 65 patients in the surgery group were confirmed to have negative pathology, and 21 of them did not require supplementary treatment after surgery due to a low risk of postoperative pathology. This indicates that surgery not only reduces the tumor burden but also allows for accurate evaluations of imaging-positive lymph nodes. Nevertheless, CCRT is also a feasible treatment option, as it allows for avoiding the dual impact of surgical risk and the side effects of radiation and chemotherapy on patients when its efficacy is equivalent to that of surgical treatment, thus improving patients' quality of life and reducing their financial burdens.",

However, due to insufficient implementation of preventive methods in developing countries, it remains the fourth most common cancer among women worldwide. 1 Despite significant progress in the prevention and treatment of cervical cancer, there were approximately 600,000 new cases and 340,000 deaths in 2020. 2 A better understanding of the etiopathogenesis of the tumor process at all its biological levels can lead to better therapeutic decisions and reduce these devastating consequences. Although prevention and early diagnosis are key to better outcomes, the choice of the optimal therapeutic modality for established disease remains controversial. 3 reatment modalities for cervical cancer include surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and their combinations. The optimal treatment modality maximizes overall survival and disease-free survival while minimizing the unwanted side effects of treatment. In the early stages of the disease, surgical intervention is the method of choice, so the choice of the type of surgical procedure is crucial. \n\nTypes of surgical procedures include conization, radical trachelectomy, simple and radical hysterectomies with or without lymphadenectomy. Surgical procedures differ in terms of their potential for complete cure and the unwanted consequences of treatment. Conization and radical trachelectomy preserve fertility, while radical hysterectomy involves the resection of the uterus, cervix, parametria, and the upper part of the vagina. Every third patient who undergoes radical hysterectomy experiences some permanent consequences such as urinary incontinence, vesicovaginal fistula, lymphocele, obturator, and genitofemoral neuropraxia. 4 Every second patient who undergoes pelvic lymphadenectomy develops lower limb lymphedema. 5 Given that aggressive surgical procedures are associated with significant comorbidities, it is desirable to identify subpopulations of patients who would benefit from less aggressive surgeries, without an increased risk of recurrence or death from the underlying disease.",

            "text": "FUS ablation has the potential to become an important modality for non-invasive image-guided treatment of localized breast cancer. Multiple phase I studies have proven MRI-guided and US-guided FUS ablation of breast cancer to be technically feasible and safe. The reported efficacy of FUS ablation as measured by percentages of complete tumour necrosis ranged from 20% to 100%. The difference in outcome between FUS ablation studies can be explained by differences in patient selection, imaging techniques, and tumour ablation protocols used. Although the results of US-guided and MRI-guided FUS ablation are promising, the data are too scant to justify a randomized controlled trial that compares FUS ablation with breastconserving surgery for treatment of localized breast cancer. To date, MRI-guided treatment protocols of breast tumours offer the most accurate imaging technique for breast tumour targeting, breast tumour delineation, treatment monitoring (including temperature mapping), and detection of residual disease after treatment. The next step towards clinical implementation of FUS for breast tumour ablation would be a large prospective treat-and-resect study that assesses the therapeutic efficacy of MRI-guided FUS ablation in patients with small (<2 cm) solitary breast cancers and provides data that can be used for technique standardization and guideline formulation. In addition, FUS for anti-tumour immune response induction, controlled transgene expression, and targeted drugs delivery in breast cancer patients should be explored. Currently, breast-conserving surgery remains the gold standard for breast cancer treatment. \n\nOpen Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Noncommercial License which permits any noncommercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author(s) and source are credited.",

            "text": "The aggressive surgical approach used to treat metastatic ovarian cancer is unique and remains one of the therapeutic keystones, with the aim of achieving curative treatment. The overall survival rate for epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is below 50%, mainly because the lack of early symptoms leads to a late diagnosis in almost 75% of patients, followed by limited treatment options and emerging drug resistance [1]. In 1975, Thomas Griffith was the first to show that besides the histological subtype, the extent of residual disease after surgery impacts patient outcome [2]. The extent of residual disease is classified into complete cytoreduction (0 cm) and macroscopic residual disease, which is further subclassified into optimal (<1 cm) and suboptimal (>1 cm) cytoreduction [3]. The impact of complete debulking has been confirmed in many trials as the most important prognostic factor for the survival of EOC patients, and it has been suggested to increase the efficacy of subsequent drug therapies [3][4][5]. Clinical trials have also indicated that if macroscopic residual disease remains after surgery, the patient has no significant benefit compared to those who received suboptimal debulking, highlighting the need for better tools to help surgeons achieve complete resection. \n\nIn clinical reality, complete debulking is not always feasible and can be challenging because of aggressive tumor biology, histological subtype, advanced disease stage, and unresectable tumors near vital structures [6][7][8]. To detect submillimeter and residual tumor lesions, the surgeon relies on tactile and visual inspection, training, and experience. New technologies for preoperative planning are warranted to help identify patients who will benefit from surgery, and for these patients, intraoperative guidance methods to help achieve complete debulking are crucial for their survival. \n\nOne surgical technology that was developed to meet these criteria is fluorescence image-guided surgery (FIGS). FIGS employs fluorescent molecules (fluorophores) as contrast agents, and together with specialized imaging systems, the surgeon is provided with a screen image highlighting fluorescent tumor tissue in the operating field.",

            "text": "A National Cancer Data Base analysis reported that T4 laryngeal cancer patients undergoing total laryngectomy had superior OS compared to those undergoing CCRT. [10] [13] Total laryngectomies remains advantageous in patients with T4 disease. Organ preservation may only be a reasonable alternative in certain patients. Studies have compared treatment outcomes between surgery and CCRT in those with T4 hypopharyngeal cancer. Among patients with advanced hypopharyngeal cancer reported in the NCDB, primary surgery was associated with longer survival compared to primary CCRT after propensity score adjustment. [14] The SEER database also confirmed the survival benefits of surgery such that CRT and surgery promoted a median survival of 20 and 25 months, respectively. [15] Surgery is not the only preferred treatment for T4 oropharyngeal disease, unlike T4 hypopharyngeal and laryngeal diseases. Although a handful of studies have compared surgical and nonsurgical modalities for the treatment of stage III or IV OPSCC, [16][17][18] their results have been conflicting. O'Connell et al demonstrated that among those with stage III to IV OPSCC, the surgery cohort had better disease-specific survival than did the CCRT cohort. However, a matched-pair analysis revealed that CCRT was as effective as surgery for treating advanced OPSCC. Moreover, only one retrospective study focused on T4 disease. [16] Although, 131 patients from a single academic hospital showed that surgical treatment may be associated with improved outcomes, 75% of them were HPV-positive. Subgroup analysis showed that the survival benefits of surgery over CCRT were only present in the HPV-positive group and not in the HPV-negative cohort. \n\nIn the current study, the surgery and CCRT cohorts had similar OS and DFS. [21] Thus, our results are consistent with those presented in the aforementioned study. The Paradigm trial, which compared IC followed by CCRT and cisplatin-based CCRT alone in patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer, [22] half of whom had oropharyngeal cancer, showed no difference in OS.",

Patients with low-risk (stages IIIA or IIA) tumors had better DSS than did patients with other stages (Figure 1). \n\nWe used Cox proportional hazards models to identify clinicopathologic factors related to DSS. We first performed this analysis for the entire patient cohort (Table 3). Older age (> 60 years), poorly differentiated tumor grade (III or IV), advanced tumor stage (III or IV), mucinous histology, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) positivity, and black race were associated with worse DSS. Moreover, the multivariable analyses confirmed that treatment types were independent factors associated with DSS: patients who received NCRT had the better DSS compared to patients who received other treatments. Some other factors, for example, sex and insurance status were not associated with DSS. Further analyses of the relationship between DSS and treatment modality in patients stratified by stage showed that when adjusted for disease stage, the patient's age at diagnosis, tumor histologic grade, mucinous histology, and CEA status remained significant predictors of DSS (Table 4). In addition, in each stage-stratified cohort, patients who received surgery only (with or without chemotherapy) had significantly worse DSS than did patients who received NCRT. Among patients with stages III and IV disease, those who underwent ART plus chemotherapy had significantly worse DSS than did patients who underwent NCRT (P = 0.03). Among patients with stage II tumors, the risk of death from rectal cancer was similar in the ART plus chemotherapy and NCRT groups. Neither race nor type of surgery significantly predicted DSS in patients with stage IV disease. \n\nAmong patients with stage IIIA tumors (Figure 3A), those who received ART plus chemotherapy had significantly better DSS than did those who received NCRT (hazard ratio [HR], 0.7; P = 0.04). Patients with stage IIIA tumors who underwent surgery only had the worst DSS of all the treatment groups (HR, 1.9; P < 0.00001).",

            "text": "Among cancer types, solid cancers have the highest incidence, with breast, lung and prostate cancer accounting for nearly a third of all newly diagnosed cases in 2020 [1]. Surgery is the most common treatment for these cancers, and complete tumor resection is fundamental to its success. However, one of the greatest challenges for surgeons is to identify tumor boundaries intraoperatively. For prostate cancer, for example, the percentage of resected specimens with cancer cells present at the resection border is, on average, as high as 21.03% [2]. These positive surgical margins have been associated with an increased risk of tumor recurrence and a consequent increased administration of adjuvant treatments [3][4][5]. \n\nHence, there is an important need to improve the accuracy of tumor resection. \n\nOne strategy that has been proposed to aid tumor identification and delineation is image-guided surgery [6]. A breakthrough in this field is the recent FDA approval of the first tumor-targeting agent for fluorescence-guided surgery, commercially called CYTALUX. The intraoperative use of CYTALUX revealed additional lesions in 27% of ovarian cancer patients that would otherwise have been missed, clearly illustrating the benefit of imageguided surgery [7]. However, fluorescence imaging is unfortunately limited by penetration depth, and, therefore, the combined use of nuclear and optical imaging modalities has been proposed as a strategy to further improve surgical navigation. This dual-modality concept is based on both preoperative and intraoperative illumination of cancerous tissue. Nuclear imaging has proved to be a highly sensitive technique for preoperatively detecting cancer, and the radioisotope can additionally be used to locate deeper lesions intraoperatively [8]. Complementary to this, intraoperative optical imaging can improve the surgical view of tumor boundaries in real time. Accordingly, dual-modality nuclear/fluorescent imaging probes would potentially possess the excellent sensitivity and high penetration depth of nuclear imaging and the high, but shallow, resolution and real-time visualization capability of fluorescence imaging in a single agent [9].",

Patient outcomes have improved over the past 3 decades as a result of several advances, which include (among others): a) stepwise improvements in the concept of multimodality therapy (consisting of increasingly sophisticated combinations of surgery, radiotherapy [RT], and chemotherapy); b) application of technically expert single-modality therapy (when the latter is appropriately chosen in selected patients [eg hyperfractionated RT in stage III oropharyngeal carcinoma]); c) individual technical innovations within each discipline (eg the advent of intensity modulated or image-guided radiation therapy); and d) intensifi cation of ancillary care methods (such as speech therapy or nutritional support) (Miller 1990;Nelson 1998;Vokes 2005). However, successful treatment with curative intent of both LA and M/R SCCHN remains a formidable clinical challenge, and new treatment options and approaches are urgently needed. This is especially true for patients who are either not eligible for surgery, have low surgical curability rates, or harbor tumors for which non-surgical therapy represents a more acceptable -and arguably better -treatment (eg, RT or chemoradiotherapy for infi ltrative LA tonsillar carcinomas). For all the above SCCHN patients, the combination of RT and cytotoxic chemotherapy, and more recently biologically targeted agents, has been the focus of intense clinical investigation, resulting in the launch of several important clinical trials.",

This finding raises doubts about the clinical significance of such a small difference and questions the true advantage of segmentectomy over lobectomy. \n\nIn light of these uncertainties, it is essential to critically assess the benefits and drawbacks of both approaches to ensure that the chosen role of surgery in stage treatment aligns with the best possible outcome for patients. Further research and analysis may be required to fully understand the implications of these findings and to guide treatment decisions effectively. \n\nPatient evaluation remains a fundamental part of the treatment strategy, with the possibility of determining the appropriate therapy in early-stage tumours. Indeed, despite the surgical resection being considered the treatment of choice, other treatments, such as Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SABR), may be considered if surgery is refused or if patient comorbidities make the surgical approach extremely risky [10,11]. For this reason, respiratory and cardiac evaluations need to be modulated on patients' characteristics and treatment options, identifying the most appropriate treatment with the highest potential advantage in terms of survival while minimizing the risk of complications [6]. \n\nThis complex approach applies to patients with tumours potentially curable by surgery, an improvement in overall survival. However, in the future, more information on histology, performance status, and stage will indicate the most suitable treatment strategy. \n\nIndeed, in the next future, Artificial Intelligence could integrate and manage complex models based on multi-omics domains (radiological, biological, etc.), providing personalized therapies also suggesting adjuvant or biologic therapy also for early stages [12][13][14]. These advancements may potentially revolutionize the field and further enhance treatment outcomes. \n\nOn the other hand, the role of surgery in stage III patients remains an intriguing and debated issue, even though it is now clear that surgery should be considered only in a multi-disciplinary approach setting, including oncologists or radiotherapists.",

            "text": "of postoperative RT on stage III EC. Boothe et al. [14] reported that stage III patients who received CMT had  better survival outcomes than patients treated with monotherapy (either RT or CT alone), which is consistent with our findings. Rauh-Hain et al. [15] reported that patients aged > 75 years with high-grade, advanced-stage EC are less likely to receive adjuvant therapy, but forgoing adjuvant therapy -whether CT, RT, or both -was associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality after correcting for other prognostic factors. In addition, smaller institutional series, where radiation treatment plans are available, have demonstrated that combined modality therapy may reduce loco-regional recurrence, which may translate to a survival benefit [16][17][18][19][20][21][22]. However, none of these studies looks separately at focused RT (brachytherapy) alone. Recently presented preliminary results from GOG 258, which investigates the use of adjuvant CT alone (carboplatin/paclitaxel) versus concurrent chemoradiation in high-risk EC after optimal debulking surgery, showed that CMT reduced the rate of local recurrence compared to CT but did not increase recurrence-free survival [23]. The European PORTEC-3 trial showed that adding concurrent cisplatin CT to pelvic radiation improved 5 year failure-free survival in stage III EC patients by 11% over pelvic radiation alone [24]. Our study is consistent with these retrospective and prospective studies, which demonstrated that CMT should be considered for locally advanced EC and that selecting patients for optimal therapies may be critical to achieving desired clinical endpoints. However, our results were unique, because we also compared the effects of EBRT (regional) to VBT (focal) in the CMT setting and found no benefit for one over the other, but still showed the benefit of CMT over monotherapy.\n\nVaginal cuff brachytherapy (VBT) is a well-established local therapy for early-stage EC after surgical resection, and VBT can be added after pelvic irradiation for patients with earlystage disease to provide excellent loco-regional control [25]",

            "text": "Optimal adjuvant treatment for gastric cancer in form of either perioperative chemotherapy or CRT is still controversial. Large prospective randomized study, namely Intergroup Study 0116 [4], which randomized 556 patients, showed clear benefit of CRT over observation. Besides, several studies [2,3] reported that adjuvant chemotherapy was beneficial. In contrast to adjuvant chemotherapy, role of PORT is relatively unsettled. Dutch study [5] showed little benefit from adjuvant CRT in D2 nodal dissection in contrast to D1 dissection. These findings were one of the underlying rationale for limited use of adjuvant CRT after D2 nodal dissection in clinical practice. Recently, the adjuvant chemoradiation therapy in stomach cancer (ARTIST) trial researchers also reported that addition of PORT was not significantly beneficial in terms of overall survival [6]. However, subgroup analysis of ARTIST trial revealed that patients with lymph node metastasis had prolonged survival with PORT. In spite of extensive surgery like D2 dissection and adjuvant chemotherapy, 8.3-23.3% of patients relapsed locoregionally without PORT [6,7]. These finding suggests that some proportion of patients would benefit from PORT. In our institution, selected patients with high risk locally advanced characteristics such as adjacent structures invasion or failed to obtain negative margin were referred for PORT. These strict indications explain why there was only limited number of patients during relatively extended accrual period. As patients were highly selected, most pati-ents in current study had many high risk features. Nodal involvement was in 92% of the patients and 77% of patients were stage III. Despite high risk features, locoregional control was achieved in 92% of patients. These finding suggests that PORT with or without chemotherapy would contribute in obtaining excellent locoregional control even in these high risk locally advanced cases. However, high rate of distant failure especially peritoneal seeding in this advanced group inferred that substantial number of patients already had disease burden in peritoneal cavity. This in turn may limit the role of additional locoregional treatment modality, such as PORT.",

            "text": "everal therapeutic options are currently used for colorectal cancer treatment. 30 However, surgery is the most common approach, 31 although the perception of ideal surgical technique differs between the Western and Asian countries. 32 Data available from Saudi Arabia indicate that rectal cancer patients undergoing curative surgery have a significantly higher survival rate, 54%, compared to 5% for those not treated surgically. 33 The use of chemotherapy was associated with better survival rates compared to patients who were only treated by surgery. 34,35 lthough more recent data indicate that only 5% of patients benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy, 30 this type of treatment is strongly recommended in case of highgrade tumors. 36 Interestingly, over a period of 20 years, from the 1980s to 2000s, the median survival rate of colorectal cancer patients increased almost three-fold, and this improvement has been attributed to a more frequent use of chemotherapy. 37 Radiotherapy has also been shown to improve the survival rate and reduce the probability of tumor recurrence, but with the introduction of new treatment modalities, its use became controversial. 38 n view of the existing controversies and the paucity of data on colorectal cancer treatment in Saudi Arabia, the objective of the present study was to explore the predictors of survival and compare the risk of mortality among a sample of colorectal cancer patients in the Kingdom who were treated with different therapeutic modalities.",

            "text": "This study is the first to report the relationship between preoperative MRI and additional assessment and primary surgical treatment in subgroups defined by breast cancer mode of detection (interval versus screen-detected). Previous studies have examined MRI use and outcomes in women with occult disease (29), however, these studies have not reported findings for the clinically distinct interval cancer cases. Women with an interval cancer diagnosis were more likely to receive MRI. Although all women receiving MRI were more likely to receive additional imaging and biopsy, we found that a higher proportion of women with an interval cancer had a mastectomy than women with screen-detected cancers, regardless of MRI use (21% versus 13%). Even after adjusting for patient and cancer characteristics, women with interval cancer were over 60%, more likely to have a mastectomy compared to women with a screen-detected cancer. Many previous studies have accounted for cancer histology, stage, grade, tumor size, and other prognostic cancer characteristics when assessing utilization of imaging, biopsy, and surgical management for breast cancer in relation to preoperative MRI. However, our results indicate that even after adjustment for these key prognostic factors, women with interval cancers were different from those with screen-detected cancers in relation to preoperative MRI and surgical treatment. Women with an interval cancer were more likely to have a mastectomy regardless of whether or not they had a preoperative MRI, suggesting there may be other factors related to interval cancer that impact surgical management. For example, the anxiety level for a woman with an interval cancer may be higher than a woman with a screen-detected cancer because her cancer was missed on a previous mammogram. Hence, although these women have more advanced disease and surgical options may be limited, women with interval cancer that do have surgical options may opt for a more extensive surgery to relieve her anxiety about risk of recurrence.\n\nInterval breast cancers represent a challenging subgroup to study, given the relatively small numbers represented in existing population-based data. However, given the poorer prognosis among these women, this subpopulation is important to consider when evaluating the utilization and outcomes of breast imaging modalities such as MRI. Published literature on preoperative MRI has reported the conundrum of a preoperative modality that is optimal for detecting subclinical cancer foci",

            "text": "Approximately 90% of ovarian cancers arise from the coelomic epithelium or modified mesothelium [1]. Surface epithelial tumors are the most common type of ovarian cancer [2]. Epithelial ovarian, tubal, and peritoneal cancers have been recognized as one neoplastic entity because a lot of evidence points to a common M\u00fcllerian epithelium derivation and similar management of these three neoplasms [3,4]. \n\nEpithelial ovarian cancer generally presents at an advanced stage (75%), often due to its asymptomatic nature [5]. It remains the leading cause of gynecological cancer mortality, accounting for 43% of deaths [6]. \n\nPlatinum-based chemotherapy following primary cytoreductive surgery forms the cornerstone of epithelial ovarian cancer treatment [7]. Evidence suggests that optimal cytoreduction is the most important prognostic factor of survival [8,9]. \n\nCytoreductive surgery is more feasible in patients with early-stage disease; however, individuals with advanced-stage EOC frequently present with extensive metastatic disease. This makes primary cytoreductive surgery an aggressive procedure with potentially high perioperative morbidity and mortality. \n\nPatients with advanced-stage disease, extensive tumor burden, older age, poor performance status or medical comorbidities may benefit from neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy (NACT) [10,11]. \n\nImaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and 18-Florodeoksiglukoz positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) may provide valuable information regarding the extent of the disease, the location of peritoneal metastases, and the feasibility of complete cytoreductive surgery. This critical information aids gynecologic oncologists in determining the most appropriate therapeutic strategy [12]. \n\nAlthough CT is most commonly used to stage ovarian cancer patients, MRI and PET/CT are increasingly used in specialized centers. \n\nThis study aims to assess the sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of these imaging modalities for EOC.",

            "text": "therapy in the 1960s, this modality, due to its promising results, has gained a great deal of popularity in the management of patients with early stages of oral cavity cancers [7]. However, there has not been a head-to-head comparison of surgery versus radiotherapy (BRT \u00b1 EBRT) as the primary treatment modalities so far, though, the outcomes have been comparable [8,9]. Thus, the choice of treatment should be completed on age, performance status, and quality of life [10]. Accordingly, reports suggest that definitive treatment with brachytherapy is not only safe, but also effective even in people above 80-years of age when surgery is usually not possible [11,12].\n\nOur findings suggest that adjuvant brachytherapy (as a monotherapy or combined with EBRT) when added to surgery is effective in the treatment of oral cavity cancers. Using brachytherapy (completely or partially) instead of external beam radiation, when indicated, shortens the treatment time and protects the tissues from being exposed to radiation. These benefits are translated to decreased overall treatment time and reduction in machine overload rate, which is a major issue in developing countries with long waiting lists.\n\nInterestingly, our results have shown that the fouryear overall survival of our patients exceeds 80%. In addition, the disease-free survival rates were also encouraging. Another encouraging finding of this study was the extremely low rates of radiation-induced complications, especially xerostomia that lasts for a long time and is immune to treatment [13]. If anything, low complications should complement the large benefits seen with HDR-IBT. There are some explanations other than the use of BT for relatively high survival rates compared to similar reports in Iran and other Asian countries [1,5]. Based on earlier national reports, more than 50% of patients had stage III or IV [14], while in our series, the majority of the tumors were node-negative T1-T2, which implies better outcomes than more advanced lesions [15,16,17]. Another explanation is that all lesions were treated with surgery and postop radiation, which brings about better survival in comparison to surgery or definitive radiation alone [18,19].\n\nThere are a number of reports in the literature presenting the efficacy of BT in primary malignant lesions",

            "text": "Prostate cancer (PC) in Europe is the most common cancer in men over 70 years old [1], with approximately 449.761 new cases in Europe and 43.837 new cases in Italy in 2018 [2]. Despite its high prevalence, combining all stages, survival is high for PC (98%) [3]. \n\nFurthermore, prostate carcinoma is extremely heterogeneous, ranging from an indolent chronic illness to an aggressive, rapidly fatal systemic malignancy. The classic prognostic factors, tumor stage, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, and Gleason score (GS) have been combined to classify patients into distinct risk groups to determine the most appropriate treatment [4]. \n\nA multitude of treatments for PC patients, particularly in low-risk disease, is available [5][6][7]. Surgery, radiotherapy (RT), androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), active surveillance, or other therapeutic strategies, such as cryotherapy, high-intensity focused ultrasound, mini-invasive surgery, have offered advantages to patient survival even if sometimes resulting in worsening quality of life (QoL) and side effects [5][6][7]. \n\nFor these reasons, new advances have been made in treatment modalities to reduce side effects while maintaining or improving outcomes. \n\nThis challenge has been met with new radiation technologies developed and adopted for clinical use in prostate cancer, responding to the need to deliver dose-escalated RT while minimizing treatment-related morbidity and toxicities. \n\nIn particular, RT techniques as intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and technologies as image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) and proton therapy contributed to improving outcomes and reducing toxicities. IMRT is able to deliver dose-escalated RT without increasing morbidity compared with 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) at lower doses, so it is the recommended technique in PC by the European Association of Urology (EAU) [8] and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) [4].",

            "text": "While the surgical strategy for the advanced stages has remained unchanged, surgery has been more frequently offered as primary treatment for patients with early-stage LSCC in many centers including Karolinska University Hospital. 25 Here, surgery as primary treatment for patients with T1a glottic LSCC was performed in 24% of the patients during 2000-2004 compared with 40% during 2010-2015. 7][28] In the case of recurrent T1 disease, it could be beneficial to have surgery as the primary treatment since RT/CRT then still remains a treatment option and TL could be avoided. In either case, it is of paramount importance to select an appropriate modality at a multidisciplinary tumor board meeting depending on the patient and tumor characteristics. \n\nRegarding the T1b group with tumor extension on both vocal cords, patients were mainly treated with RT to avoid anterior commissure web formation, a well-known complication after surgery. In this study, we did not evaluate voice quality and complications after surgery/RT in this group of patients. Other studies however indicate that with small tumors, surgery is likely to be equivalent to RT regarding voice function after treatment. 29 The survival outcome for T1 glottic laryngeal cancer is in general favorable and our results compare well with results from other studies. 5,30 though previous studies show equivalent outcomes for surgery and RT alone for selected T2 tumors, 15 we can establish that surgery as a single primary treatment modality was used sparingly for T2 \n\ntumors in this study. Only two patients out of 122 were treated with surgery as the primary treatment. This is probably tradition related at our center but does not seem to have had a negative impact on the outcome in general. 31  our study almost all patients with supraglottic LSCC were treated with RT, as single modality (T1-, T2-disease) or combined with chemotherapy (T3-disease) or TL (T4-disease). Only 3/114 patients were treated with surgery alone.",

Most importantly however our biggest challenge is to improve the reproducibility of the functional information offered by molecular imaging so that we can best relate this information to established disease outcome measures through well designed image based clinical trials. \n \nFrontiers in Cancer Imaging and Diagnosis welcomes technical and clinical papers that address the challenges and limitations of current techniques, or that present new findings and potential use of these techniques, with the final goal to optimize their use. Studies that compare different imaging modalities or that show the complementary role multimodality imaging are believed to be important to address the challenges on how to best utilize the current imaging modalities. \n \nThe world of cancer imaging is blessed by a vibrant community of scientists that work to create contrast agents and tracers for different aspects of cancer biology: DNA synthesis and cellular proliferation (Vesselle et al., 2002), tumor hypoxia (Dubois et al., 2004), angiogenesis and apoptosis (Beer and Schwaiger, 2008; Belhocine, 2008), glucose metabolism to cite only some. Many of these new agents have already been tested in humans and in clinical trials, many are being evaluated in animal imaging trials. Frontiers in Cancer Imaging and Diagnosis recognizes the challenges that are associated with studies that evaluate the feasibility of new imaging modalities, and with the use of these new agents to explore the effect of cancer treatment on different aspects of tumor biology, and welcomes publications in this field. These studies will eventually lead to a more individualized assessment of tumor biology and personalized treatments. \n \nProgress in cancer imaging can also guide toward a more personalized and potentially more effective use of image guided interventions. As a number of image guided interventions are available (focused radiation treatment, embolization, chemoembolization, radiofrequency ablation, radiochemoembolization etc.), we realize that some of these interventions are more successful for some types/subtypes of tumors or biological cancer conditions, and less successful in others. It is conceivable for example, that in conditions of hypoxia, tumors may be more resistant to treatment (Eschmann et al",

            "text": "Patients with poorly and moderately differentiated tumours had three fold and almost two fold risk of death, respectively, compared to those who had well differentiated tumours. However, it is worth noting that some reports have not shown tumour grade to have an effect on survival [11,23]. The type of treatment received by the patient was not a predictor of survival in this study. Of the 384 patients, about two-thirds (67.3%) received at least one form of treatment (Table 3). Radiotherapy, either alone or in combination with surgery was the most common treatment modality. Patients treated with surgery showed the highest two-year and five-year survival rates followed by surgery and radiotherapy. However, most untreated patients died within 5 years and so did many of the patients treated with radiotherapy alone or chemotherapy alone. However, several studies where surgery was the primary mode of treatment found treatment modality as a significant predictor of survival [10][11][12]21]. The treatment modality is dependent on stage of disease and other parameters such as anatomical site, tumour size, distant metastasis, histological type and lymph node involvement [12]. While surgery alone may be recommended for patients with early stage disease, adjuvant radiotherapy or chemotherapy is indicated for patients with advanced stages [12]. \n\nThe large number of patients lost to follow up could also explain why treatment modality was not a significant predictor of survival since patients who were lost to follow-up had a borderline difference (p = 0.057) from those who were not, with respect to treatment group. Patients who were lost to follow-up were most likely those who were assigned to treatment modalities that required repeated visits such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy for advanced stage disease. It is also possible that many of the patients lost to follow-up were travelling long distances to access these treatment modalities, which would make re-visits expensive. Furthermore, patients were classified solely on their treatment status without taking into consideration the dosage, duration and compliance with treatment received. In our setting sometimes surgery is not an option due limited surgical space. Sometimes this may lead to significant delays in accessing the service thus disease progression and change in stage [25].",

            "text": "Advanced imaging techniques, such as PSMA PET/CT, should be systematically integrated into surgical research to optimize patient selection and enhance procedural precision. The use of PSMA PET/CT for precise patient selection and the identification of oligometastatic lesions has been shown to improve the effectiveness of MDT, leading to prolonged progression-free survival compared to earlier imaging modalities, such as choline PET/CT [32]. Prospective studies should assess how imaging-guided approaches can improve outcomes by identifying metastatic lesions that may benefit more from surgical resection than from SABR. Collaborative multicenter studies will be essential in overcoming challenges associated with the rarity of oligoprogressive mCRPC. International networks pooling resources and expertise can enable larger patient cohorts and more statistically robust analyses. Additionally, biomarker-driven research should identify specific patient subgroups most likely to benefit from surgical interventions, facilitating personalized treatment approaches. Finally, the integration of surgery into multimodal treatment regimens offers potential for enhanced outcomes. Combining surgery with systemic therapies, such as androgen receptor inhibitors (ARIs), immunotherapies, or radiopharmaceuticals like 177Lu-PSMA-617, could provide synergistic effects and improve long-term disease control. Future research should also investigate the optimal timing of surgical interventions within the treatment continuum, particularly in relation to systemic therapies and radiotherapy.",

            "text": "A multimodal approach to treatment is a basic oncologic principle with proven survival benefits for most cancer types. However, existing guidelines recommend single modalities for treating each stage of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Nonetheless, multimodal approaches can be considered for HCC, depending on the characteristics of the disease in individual cases. Radiotherapy (RT), an effective local modality, is a critical element of most multimodal approaches. Improved RTtechnology and increased understanding of the tolerance of the liver to radiation have contributed to the popularity of RT for treating liver tumors in clinical practice. Consequently, numerous reports have described the effects of RT on liver cancer, despite a lack of stringent evidence for its benefits. RT can be delivered using various technologies and approaches, which may be the source of some confusion. For example, high-dose ablative RT can be curative on its own, or high-dose ablative or conventional RT can complement other treatments such as radiofrequency ablation and transarterial chemoembolization. Combinations of systemic agents and RT can also be applied. This review discusses the optimal selection of RT as part of a multimodal approach for HCC.",

            "text": "The global incidence of prostate cancer (PC) is second only to lung cancer, and it is also the second leading cause of cancer death among men in the United States (1). PC is a heterogeneous disease with a variable natural history (2). With the introduction of serum prostate-specific antigen(PSA) testing in the late 1980s, the age at diagnosis of PC was nearly 10 years earlier, so surgeons can now provide more prompt surgical intervention early in tumor development without waiting for advanced stage (3). \n\nPC has a variety of treatment options, including active surveillance (AS), surgical resection, radiotherapy (RT), chemotherapy, local ablation therapy (cryotherapy, highintensity focused ultrasound), etc. Surgery is the primary treatment modality for PC, including radical prostatectomy (RP) and local tumor resection. However, while up to half of the patients with PC require only active surveillance at initial diagnosis, most men are willing to undergo aggressive local surgical treatment. Radical prostatectomy is associated with improved cancer-specific mortality(CSM), metastasis-free survival, and the need for palliative care, and surgical resection may be more beneficial for PC patients than radiotherapy (4). Xia et al. demonstrated that men undergoing radical prostatectomy had an increased life expectancy by 1.8 months compared to active surveillance (5). The above studies suggest that patients with PC treated with surgery may have a better prognosis. However, some studies suggest that surgery does not have much benefit in the prognosis of PC patients. The ProtecT trial reported the results of several extensive cohort studies suggesting that active surveillance could be safely used in carefully selected low-risk PC patients (6,7). Elisabeth M et al. also found that surgical resection and radiotherapy did not benefit much from survival in patients with low-risk PC (4). We found that the current study is controversial regarding the impact of surgical treatment on the prognosis of PC patients. Based on this, we are eager to develop a model that can predict prognostic factors in PC patients undergoing surgery.",

The incidence of HpV-associated oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (oscc) is steadily increasing. given the better prognosis in patients with HpV-positive cancer compared to HpV-negative cancer, attempts were made to reduce the therapeutic effect in patients with early-stage oscc to improve the quality of life of these patients. early-stage oscc can currently been treated with radiation therapy or surgery used alone or in combination. Currently, the concept of transoral surgery includes both transoral laser microsurgery and robot-assisted surgeries (da Vinci, medrobotics Flex system). Case description. We report a case of using the da Vinci robot-assisted system in the combined modality treatment of oropharyngeal cancer. The patient underwent surgery followed by chemoradiotherapy. At a follow-up of 10 months, no evidence of disease progression was found. The patient experienced no any pain on swallowing.Conclusion. The use of the da Vinci robot-assisted surgical system in the combined modality treatment of oropharyngeal cancer, especially in such a hard-to-reach area as the root of the tongue, makes it possible to better visualize and determine the boundaries of the lesion, followed by en block resection, as well as to improve functional and aesthetic results. However, careful selection of patients for this type of treatment is necessary.",

Recently, the Prostate Cancer Results Study Group compared radical prostatectomy, radiotherapy, cryotherapy, and high intensity focused ultrasonography, but interpretation of their results is difficult owing to multiple study limitations, including the use of differing definitions of biochemical recurrence as the endpoint. 7 One study used the American Society for Radiation Oncology definition of biochemical recurrence in 1872 patients treated by surgery, external beam radiotherapy, or brachytherapy, and found that surgery was superior in the group with Gleason 8-10 scores, but with no differences seen for low risk patients in whom follow-up was relatively short; thus this last cohort did well for cancer outcome regardless of treatment choice. 8 Using clinical recurrence (metastases) as an endpoint, a study of 2380 patients again showed that low risk patients had few events and thus no differences between surgery and radiotherapy were observed, but for intermediate and high risk patients the data favoured radical prostatectomy (overall hazard ratio 0.35 for surgery v radiotherapy). 17 Data from an observational study of more than 404 000 men treated at more than 1000 community hospitals in 44 states of the United States from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample making up more than 20% of all community hospital  18 19 A multi-institutional US study of 10 429 men treated with surgery, external beam radiotherapy, or brachytherapy showed that external beam radiotherapy was associated with an adjusted 10 year prostate cancer specific mortality hazard ratio of 1.5 compared with surgery, but that brachytherapy and surgery were equivalent. 20 Furthermore, a study of 6849 patients from the primary data source used in our study, the National Prostate Cancer Registry of Sweden, found that the difference between observed and expected mortality was greater for surgery compared with observation than for radiotherapy compared with observation. 21 A study that analysed the Cancer of the prostate Strategic Urologic research Endeavor database on 7538 men with high risk prostate cancer found a roughly twofold increase in cancer specific mortality for radiotherapy compared with surgery. 22 Furthermore, data on 6692 men without comorbidities treated from 1995 to 2007 at two academic centres in the United States showed that radiotherapy was associated with an increase in prostate cancer related",

            "text": "This study demonstrates there was no significant difference in 5-year OS and DFS between the two treatment strategies before and after PSM. Moreover, there was no difference in patterns of failure. Notably, the majority (88.7%) of women who underwent radical hysterectomy received adjuvant therapy. The results were in line with those of previous reports. A prospective randomized trial had shown radiotherapy and surgery to be equally effective as primary treatments for women with early cervical cancer [5]. Subsequent retrospective studies did not reveal significantly different survival outcomes between definitive CRT and hysterectomy followed by tailored adjuvant therapy in early cervical cancer [6,16]. More recently, a phase III randomized controlled trial reported the surgical treatment after neoadjuvant chemotherapy does not improve oncologic outcomes compared with upfront CRT in early-stage cervical cancer patients [17]. However, among the patients who underwent surgery, 23-63% required adjuvant radiotherapy or CRT [5,[16][17][18]. The combination of treatment modalities increases treatment-related morbidities. Landoni et al. reported that higher short-term and long-term complications occurred in the surgery plus adjuvant radiotherapy group than in the primary radiotherapy group [5]. In addition, a recent retrospective study using PSM reported a higher incidence of grade three genitourinary complications in early cervical cancer patients with radical hysterectomy followed by tailored adjuvant therapy than with definitive CRT [6]. In addition, previous studies did not use advanced radiotherapy techniques, such as MRI-guided brachytherapy. MRI-guided brachytherapy can reduce toxicity [14,19] and may lead to more favorable benefits in terms of toxicity with definitive CRT than with surgery followed by adjuvant therapy. \n\nThe presence of pelvic nodal metastasis is a major indication of adjuvant therapy and affects the prognosis of patients with cervical cancer [8,20,21]. The revised FIGO staging reflected the lymph node status. Nevertheless, there is a lack of consensus regarding the most appropriate treatment modality for early cervical cancer presenting with pelvic nodal involvement on imaging.",

            "text": "Similarly, studies have found that while spinal metastases from other primary cancers may not benefit significantly from surgical intervention, lungoriginated metastases show improved survival following surgical treatment [22]. However, Amelot et al. (2020) reported conflicting results, finding that surgery, whether en bloc resection or decompression, did not improve survival in NSCLC patients with spinal metastases [23]. Our study supports the survival benefits of surgery alone in both NSCLC and SCLC populations with metastatic spinal disease. Notably, the higher frequency of surgery observed in the NSCLC cohort may be attributed to their comparatively better baseline health, which enables them to better tolerate and recover from complex spinal surgeries [21]. In addition, one study also showed the role of early diagnosis and treatments is associated with improved outcomes, which warrants more studies to confirm [24]. \n\nRadiation therapy remains a primary treatment modality for spinal metastases, offering effective disease control and symptom palliation [23,25]. In our study, radiation alone was the most commonly utilized modality in both NSCLC and SCLC groups, providing significant survival benefits, which is consistent with prior research [26]. While radiation modalities were evaluated for treating spinal metastases in various studies, the optimal radiation technologies for lung-originated spine metastases remain underexplored. Our findings showed that IMRT provided the best OS in the NSCLC cohort, outperforming EBRT, the current standard treatment for spinal metastases [26]. This aligns with previous studies highlighting IMRT's ability to deliver dose-escalated, highly conformal radiation while sparing critical structures such as the spinal cord [27,28]. However, in the SCLC cohort, IMRT did not confer significant survival advantages over EBRT, suggesting a need for further research into more advanced radiation modalities tailored for this patient population. Additionally, some studies have identified SBRT as a safe and effective option for managing spinal metastases while preserving neurological function, particularly in the reirradiation setting [29,30]. However, in our study, SBRT was associated with inferior long-term survival outcomes compared to IMRT and EBRT.",

In recent years, with the increasing importance of limb sparing surgery, preoperative radiotherapy has increased in practice. Preoperative RT associated with higher local control rate and optimal limb sparing surgery rate (98%) [15] . Therefore, preoperative RT decision should always be discussed in the multidisciplinary team, and the choice of these patients should be considered. \n\nOur research examined variables of sex, age, median tumor size (at diagnosis), histopathological type of the tumor, tumor localization, tumor grade, tumor depth, median radiotherapy doses, radiotherapy modalities, resection margins and we did not find them to be prognostic factors. In our study, the median age of our patients was 28.5 years (range: 19-52) which was a similar study in the literature [16,17,18] . There was a male dominance. Median tumor size was 9.2cm (range 6-14cm).In literature, large size, high grade, deep location were adverse factors for distant metastasis [19] . In addition, histological subtype was very important to the choice of preoperative RT. Piston et al. [20] demonstrated that myxoid liposarcoma good response to radiotherapy compared with other soft tissue sarcoma subtypes. We had only 2 (8.3%) patient histological subtype liposarcoma. In literature, tumor grade (especially high grade), tumor depth (deep location), positive(R2) or close resection margin (R1) associated with adverse prognostic factors [17,21,22] . The presence of adverse factors notably increases the risk of local recurrence, distant metastases and a worsening of survival [23] . However, in our study, we did not find significant prognostic factors. \n\nIntensity-modulated RT(IMRT) was potentially less morbidity than 3-D conformal RT.",

For this reason, determining optimal treatment regimens for specific subsets of patients \n with brain metastases is imperative for clinicians. The purpose of this article is to review the randomized controlled \n trials analyzing patients with brain metastases treated with neurosurgery, WBRT, and SRS to determine future \n research directions for physicians and scientists. For patients who have a Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) \n \u226570 and a single, surgically accessible brain metastasis, surgical resection followed by post-operative WBRT has \n proven to be a superior treatment modality when compared to WBRT alone and surgical resection alone. Evidence \n suggests that the addition of WBRT to SRS results in increased levels of survival for patients who have a single brain \n metastasis and increased levels of local tumor control for patients who have 1 to 4 brain metastases. Questions \n remain regarding survival and tumor control in patients treated with SRS with or without WBRT, which warrants \n further clinical investigation into this controversial matter. Although several randomized controlled trials have been \n published assessing the clinical outcomes of patients with brain metastases treated with a variety of treatment \n modalities, many studies are limited by poor patient accrual and further randomized evidence is needed to guide \n clinicians in their future treatment decisions.",

            "text": "Our PD-1-IRDye800CW NIRF probe is new and safer than nuclear imaging and possesses the potential for use in intraoperative FMI-guided surgery. Thus, the image-guided surgery was performed utilizing the PD-1-IRDye800CW fluorescence probe in this study, and the post-resection BLI data revealed that intraoperative guidance with the PD-1 fluorescence probe enabled a more precise resection with the absence of detectable tumor residuals. For certain cancers, including breast cancer, administration of adjuvant therapies immediately after resection has led to marked improvements in treatment outcomes. Some breast cancers, particularly the triple-negative subtype, are generally aggressive tumors with a high rate of distant metastasis and poor overall survival when identified at a later stage. The limited effectiveness of surgical resection and conventional therapies has encouraged the development of immunotherapies that might be useful as adjuvants. To date, preclinical studies have shown that adjuvant immunotherapy with surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiotherapy is generally the most effective approach to treat cancer. 28 For instance, PD-1 blockade can mediate tumor regression in patients with various cancers by inhibiting adaptive immune resistance. Expression analysis revealed that PD-L1 was present in 34% of breast tumors and associated with high-risk clinicopathological features. 29 Moreover, in triple-negative breast cancer patients, there were a significantly higher number of intratumoral CD8 + T cells in tumors that were PD-L1 + compared with that in PD-L1 \u2212 tumors, suggesting a strong association of PD-1/ PD-L1 signaling with breast tumor. 30 In this preclinical study, we found that post-resection PD-1 adjuvant immunotherapy significantly reduced breast tumor recurrence and metastasis, resulting in prolonged overall survival. It is worth noting that the prognosis may not be different between groups that undergo immunotherapy after complete resection with or without FMI guidance, and the current concept cannot be applied in the case of tumors not related to PD-1/PD-L1 signals.",

            "text": "By analyzing the patient treatment and outcome from a prospective institutional based database (WID) we found a significantly improved survival of patients treated for rectal cancer in the last two decades. This was eminent and therefore attributable to patients who were treated with newly implemented strategies for rectal cancer. Major changes as neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy and TME have been introduced at our institution between 1999-2003. Consequently, improvements in outcome comparing the time periods between 1993-2001 with 2002-2010 were to be expected. Unfortunately we cannot attribute the improved survival directly to special change in treatment. It seams very likely to be an additional and potentially synergistic effect of improved surgery, neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment rather than coexistence of the several effects.\n\nHistorically, surgical resection for rectal cancer has been burdened by a high local recurrence rate and concomitant or consecutive distant metastatic disease resulting in a moderate 5-year survival rate. With progress in surgical technique, supportive management and new insights in the understanding of oncological principles improved outcome was observed [20]. Especially in the last two decades, the therapeutic management has changed dramatically in terms of pre-and postoperative treatment, as well as surgical strategy. Each individual change has demonstrated advantages in terms of outcome (survival, recurrence etc.) or quality of life (sphincter preservation, fecal continence, etc.).\n\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study comparing survival and recurrence rates including all implemented changes over the past two decades, rather than focusing on a single aspect in the change of management in a large case series with over 600 patients. We have deliberately included all patients, irrespective of cancer stage, age or treatment intention to reflect the clinical daily live reality in this cancer. Since this is a longitudinal study of a single institution within the same region, a selection bias by massive socioeconomic changes in the study population appears to be unlikely.\n\nWe observed a significant shift towards more patients with clinical stage UICC III and less clinical stage UICC II, probably due to a more detailed diagnostic work-up via MRI and endoluminal ultrasound in the second time period [21,22]. This also might account for a possible underrepresentation of clinical UICC stage III",

            "text": "This strong correlation between dosimetric metrics and tumor control underscores the necessity for precise treatment planning with aggressive radiation dose to achieve optimal outcomes. \n\nOur analysis revealed no significant relationship between FFLP and tumor volume metrics, such as GTV or PTV size, suggesting that tumor volume may play a less critical role than dosimetric factors in achieving local control. While this finding contrasts with earlier studies that identified tumor volume as a determinant of local control [28,29], it likely reflects advancements in IGRT and the ability to deliver higher, more conformal radiation doses to larger tumors. This lack of correlation also underscores the versatility of SBRT in treating a wide range of lesion sizes, where other modalities, such as thermal ablation, often face limitations, particularly in managing larger or anatomically challenging tumors [35]. \n\nThe comparison of FFLP between CRC and non-CRC metastases revealed no significant differences, challenging historical perceptions of CRC metastases as less responsive to radiation therapy [14,36]. This finding is consistent with recent data demonstrating comparable outcomes across different primary tumor types when treated with SBRT [15]. These results underscore the potential of SBRT to provide effective local control agnostic to tumor origin, broadening its applicability in clinical practice. \n\nMoreover, a significant strength of our study lies in incorporating advanced motion management techniques, particularly IGRT combined with iBH using a surface-guided RT (SGRT) system. Patients treated with IGRT-iBH demonstrated superior FFLP rates compared to those treated with FB IGRT, highlighting the critical role of motion management in minimizing tumor motion, improving target coverage, and sparing adjacent healthy tissues [17,18,20] and also supporting previous analysis, which showed the advanced motion management improved the local control [28]. These findings emphasize the importance of integrating advanced imaging and motion management strategies to optimize the therapeutic ratio of SBRT. \n\nBeyond survival and tumor control outcomes, our study explored the modeling of tumor control probabilities as a function of dosimetric parameters. Logistic regression models revealed that PD was the most robust predictor of 1-year tumor control, with the lowest residual deviance and AIC values.",

            "text": "The incidence of cervical cancer (CC) has steadily declined over the last few decades coincident with the widespread, population-based screening. However, CC remains the third most common cancer in females and the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in females worldwide, especially in low-and middle-income countries. [1][2][3] For patients with locally advanced CC, definitive radiochemotherapy is the standard treatment, 4 while neoadjuvant chemotherapy + radical surgery was also a choice of treatment. [5][6][7][8] The standard treatment for stage IB1 and IIA1 CC is radical hysterectomy, whereas radiotherapy (RT) with or without chemotherapy is currently reserved as an optional treatment for nonoperative patients. 9 Population-based studies have shown that most patients with stage IB-IIA CC underwent radical surgery rather than RT. [10][11][12] One randomized study found that the survival outcomes between radical hysterectomy and primary RT were similar for stage IB-IIA cervical squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), whereas radical surgery was a better choice for patients with cervical adenocarcinoma. 13 However, there is still ongoing debate regarding the optimal local treatment modalities for early-stage CC. Two previous population-based studies indicated that surgical treatment was associated with significantly better survival outcomes compared with primary RT in stage IB-IIA CC. 10,11 A recent study of the National Cancer Database indicated that the addition of chemotherapy to definitive RT in stage IB1 and IIA1 CC improved overall survival (OS). 14 The purpose of our study was to determine whether radical hysterectomy or definitive radiochemotherapy was superior in women with stage IB1 and IIA1 CC.",

            "text": "Rectal cancer is a paradigm for multimodal management, as the combination of surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy (RT) is necessary to achieve the optimal outcome [1] . The incidence of rectal cancer in the European Union is approximately 35% of the total colorectal cancer incidence with 15-25/100 000 per year. The mortality is 4-10/100 000 per year with lower rates for females [2] . \n\nSurgery remains the primary determinant of cure in patients with localized rectal cancer, and total mesorectal excision (TME) is now widely accepted as standard of care [3,4] . Early-stage rectal cancer (TNM: T1-T2N0M0) is associated with 5-year survival rates greater than 90% after surgery alone; therefore, neoadjuvant treatment is reserved for locally advanced disease. \n\nIn recent years, significant advances have been made in the treatment of rectal cancer with new antitumor agents and approaches. Among these approaches, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) has attracted great attention. For patients with invasive tumors, neoadjuvant therapy has been utilized to promote tumor regression. Several phase \u2162 studies have compared preoperative CRT to RT alone. The rates of complete pathological response are higher in the combination groups and have been linked to improved long-term outcome. \n\nThe widespread implementation of neoadjuvant short-course RT or long-course CRT has reduced local recurrence rates from 25% to 40% to less than 10%; however, only the Swedish Rectal Cancer Trial demonstrated an overall survival (OS) benefit. Despite low local relapse rates, systemic recurrence remains a significant problem, occurring in 30% to 40% of patients [5,6] . \n\nThe last two decades have witnessed the development of a variety of preoperative RT and CRT schedules designed to optimize the sequence of treatment modalities and the most appropriate scheduling of RT and FUbased chemotherapy [7] .",

            "text": "Radiotherapy (RT) and surgery are the two most frequently used therapeutic modalities in head and neck cancer. For early-stage tumours in many sites, surgical excision or RT have similar cure rates but have a different side-effect profile. Radiotherapy traditionally offered higher rates of organ preservation and for some cancers where function is important, it is the treatment of choice. For example, RT allows preservation of natural speech and swallowing in carcinomas of the larynx and tongue base. 1 At other sites (e.g. carcinoma of the oral cavity), surgical excision alone may be curative and be associated with a very satisfactory functional outcome. The choice of treatment modality therefore depends on individual factors including patient preference.\n\nFor an advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, single modality treatment (either surgery or RT alone) is associated with poor outcomes. For these tumours, the combined use of surgery and post-operative RT or use of combined chemotherapy and radiation schedules frequently offer the highest chance of achieving cure.\n\nIn recent years, RT has benefited from advances in cancer imaging, treatment planning computer software and developments in radiation delivery technology. It is now one of the most technology-driven branches of medicine. Typically head and neck cancer patients will have radiation therapy which is based on the state-of-the-art imaging technology including computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography or other imaging techniques. Optimisation of treatment planning is performed on high-speed computer software, which intelligently selects the most appropriate beam directions and shapes. Treatment is delivered by computer-driven linear accelerators with sub-millimetre accuracy allowing radiation to be focused on the tumour bearing tissues and minimising radiation to normal tissue structures.\n\nIntensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) is now an established form of radiation therapy which allows better control of radiation dose delivery in the head and neck. In a randomised trial performed in the UK, IMRT has been shown to reduce radiation-induced xerostomia (the main long-term side effect of the standard RT) from 75 to 39 per cent ( p = 0.004) at 12 months following treatment. 2 A similar result has been demonstrated for patients with nasopharyngeal cancer. 3 Intensity-modulated radio",

Because curative surgery is regarded as the only option for cure, early detection of resectable gastric cancer is extremely important for good patient outcomes. Therefore, noninvasive diagnostic modalities such as evolutionary endoscopy and positron emission tomography are utilized as screening tools for gastric cancer. To date, early gastric cancer is being treated using minimally invasive methods such as endoscopic treatment and laparoscopic surgery, while in advanced cancer it is necessary to consider multimodality treatment including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery. Because of the results of large clinical trials, surgery with extended lymphadenectomy could not be recommended as a standard therapy for advanced gastric cancer. Recent clinical trials had shown survival benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy after curative resection compared with surgery alone. In addition, recent advances of molecular targeted agents would play an important role as one of the modalities for advanced gastric cancer.

            "text": "A Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database study additionally demonstrated better overall survival for patients with PCL treated with surgery compared to those treated with chemotherapy alone. However, a subgroup analysis demonstrated that certain groups including those with rectal disease, left-sided disease, and certain histological subtypes did not show a survival benefit from surgery [19]. The authors acknowledged that there is a lack of evidence to support a correlation of surgical intervention with improved survival. The study was limited by lack of important clinical information including chemotherapy data, selection bias, and variations in data reporting and coding systems [19]. Hangge and colleagues report on their experience of PCL by comparing an institutional cohort to SEER database. While institutional patients who underwent surgery had the highest 5-year overall survival, these authors concluded that treatment modality of surgery versus no surgery was not predictive of overall survival [5]. In fact, the most common treatment in the institutional cohort was chemotherapy alone. The higher survival rate in surgical patients was thought to be impacted by preoperative selection bias, disease stage, and histological subtype. \n\nAdditionally, a subgroup analysis did not detect any significant differences; however, small sample sizes limited the ability to power for this analysis [5]. Another systematic review of primary gastrointestinal NHL of the small and large intestines additionally concluded survival benefit in those treated with surgery [16]. However, the authors note several limitations that prevent \"evidence-based generalizable conclusions about optimal treatment practices\" [16]. Some of the limitations noted included selection bias in operative candidates, aggressive histological subtypes necessitating emergent surgeries and pre-rituximab era medical management not reflecting optimal outcomes. \n\nMany experts argue that chemotherapy alone should remain the standard therapy for patients with a highly proliferative aggressive lymphoma given high response rate and potential for cure with R-CHOP-like regimens. Additionally, the infiltrative and systemic nature of lymphoma often precludes it from being managed with surgical resection or for extent of disease to be encompassed in radiation fields [19,25].",

            "text": "Weber et al (46) studied the outcome of salvage surgery in patients following organ preservation and concluded that salvage surgery was associated with acceptable morbidity with excellent locoregional control In the present study, only 31 patients with recurrence and 11 patients with residual disease underwent salvage surgery. Others were offered either palliative chemotherapy or best supportive care in view of poor general condition and/or advanced disease. This is likely the main reason that the OS and DFS closely correspond with each other in the present study. \n\nIn the present study, univariate analysis showed that the factors associated with OS were smoking, hypertension, T stage, N stage and composite stage, and those associated with DFS were age, smoking, diabetes, hypertension, T stage, N stage and composite stage. On multivariate analysis, T stage, N stage and smoking habit were associated with OS, whereas composite stage and smoking habit were associated with DFS. In a study by Daneshi et al (47), multivariate Cox regression analysis suggested that age at diagnosis, cancer stage, type of treatment, N stage and tumor grade affected the survival of patients with locally advanced laryngeal carcinoma. \n\nThe retrospective nature of the present study, the small number of patients in various treatment groups and non-uniform treatment decisions for the entire population were the major limitations of the present study. The heterogenous treatment received by the study group made it unfeasible to derive the best treatment modality for the patients. However, in this single-institution study, the total number of patients in the cohort was high, and the majority of the patients completed the planned course of treatment without interruptions. \n\nAnti-EGFR therapy has not shown any added benefit in locally advanced head and neck cancer in addition to standard CCRT (48)(49)(50); however, it is a reasonable option in patients who cannot tolerate platinum-based chemotherapy (51,52). The role of immune checkpoint inhibitors has shown promising results in the first-line and second-line treatments for recurrent or metastatic HNSCC (53-55), but they have not shown any effect on locally advanced head and neck cancer (56).",

            "text": "Radiotherapy is an effective modality for reducing the recurrence rate and breast cancer mortality after breastconserving surgery [1,2]. Based on the spatial pattern of recurrence, partial breast irradiation (PBI) can be introduced as an alternative to conventional whole-breast irradiation followed by boost in selected patients with early breast cancer, aiming for a short treatment time and reduced toxicity. Several randomized trials and recent meta-analyses have reported comparable oncologic outcomes with PBI [3][4][5][6]. As more evidence is accumulated, the scope of indications for PBI is expanding [7]. \n\nIn PBI, defining the optimal target volume is crucial to thoroughly cover the area at risk and to simultaneously minimize toxicity. The target volume of PBI is defined as tissues surrounding the tumor bed [8]. After superficial closure of the excision cavity, the tumor bed often appears as a seroma [9,10], which makes target definition more clear and consistent. Seroma volume (SV) is well-known to typically shrink with time [11][12][13][14][15][16][17]. Therefore, an ideal target volume should differ in each PBI fraction. Several studies have reported the benefits of adaptive planning of tumor bed boost concomitant with or following whole-breast irradiation [18][19][20][21], and reducing the treatment volume by replanning in PBI is also likely to improve normal tissue protection. \n\nIn light of the seroma definition and re-imaging for adaptive radiotherapy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has several advantages over computed tomography (CT). MRI provides improved visibility of the seroma [22], facilitating both the delineation of the tumor bed and the monitoring of its volume, whereas breast parenchyma may prevent the clear visualization of seromas in CT. The lack of radiation exposure is another advantage of MRI. Therefore, the MRI-guided technique is believed to be superior to conventional CT-based radiotherapy in PBI. However, because MRI is not routinely exploited in breast cancer, to date no studies have focused on MRI-based SV changes during PBI.",

            "text": "Radiotherapy is an effective modality for reducing the recurrence rate and breast cancer mortality after breastconserving surgery [1,2]. Based on the spatial pattern of recurrence, partial breast irradiation (PBI) can be introduced as an alternative to conventional whole-breast irradiation followed by boost in selected patients with early breast cancer, aiming for a short treatment time and reduced toxicity. Several randomized trials and recent meta-analyses have reported comparable oncologic outcomes with PBI [3][4][5][6]. As more evidence is accumulated, the scope of indications for PBI is expanding [7]. \n\nIn PBI, defining the optimal target volume is crucial to thoroughly cover the area at risk and to simultaneously minimize toxicity. The target volume of PBI is defined as tissues surrounding the tumor bed [8]. After superficial closure of the excision cavity, the tumor bed often appears as a seroma [9,10], which makes target definition more clear and consistent. Seroma volume (SV) is well-known to typically shrink with time [11][12][13][14][15][16][17]. Therefore, an ideal target volume should differ in each PBI fraction. Several studies have reported the benefits of adaptive planning of tumor bed boost concomitant with or following whole-breast irradiation [18][19][20][21], and reducing the treatment volume by replanning in PBI is also likely to improve normal tissue protection. \n\nIn light of the seroma definition and re-imaging for adaptive radiotherapy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has several advantages over computed tomography (CT). MRI provides improved visibility of the seroma [22], facilitating both the delineation of the tumor bed and the monitoring of its volume, whereas breast parenchyma may prevent the clear visualization of seromas in CT. The lack of radiation exposure is another advantage of MRI. Therefore, the MRI-guided technique is believed to be superior to conventional CT-based radiotherapy in PBI. However, because MRI is not routinely exploited in breast cancer, to date no studies have focused on MRI-based SV changes during PBI.",

            "text": "Decreasing primary tumor burden in metastatic disease by radical or cytoreductive surgery has shown survival benefit in many types of malignancy apart from PCa. There are several data from other oncological entities such as colon cancer, ovarian cancer, and renal cell carcinoma which reveal survival benefit from tumor burden reduction, including primary tumor resection. \n\nIn colon cancer, Verwaal et al. 63 published an RCT which evaluated standard treatment of systemic chemotherapy alone comparing with aggressive cytoreductive surgery in combination with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy followed by systemic chemotherapy in patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis of colorectal cancer. They found that OS in patients who underwent cytoreductive surgery followed by chemotherapy was 22.3 months which was better than 12.6 months in patients who received chemotherapy alone (P \u00bc 0.032). Similarly, Temple et al. 64 found that resection of the primary tumor was associated with improved survival in patients with Stage IV colon cancer. \n\nA meta-analysis to evaluate survival outcome of maximal cytoreductive surgery in patients with advanced ovarian carcinoma was performed by Bristow et al 65 Patients who underwent more than 75% maximal cytoreductive surgery had improved OS of 33.9 months comparing with 22.7 months in patients with equal or less than 25% maximal cytoreduction (P < 0.001). \n\nMickisch et al. 66 performed an RCT to compare the treatment of radical nephrectomy plus interferon-alfaebased immunotherapy with interferon-alfa alone in pateints with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Patients who underwent cytoreductive surgery in combination with interferon-alfa had significant better OS of 17 months in comparison with 7 months in patients who received only interferon-alpha (P \u00bc 0.03). \n\n7. How should we study this concept of primary treatment in oligometastatic PCa? \n\nProspective randomized trials are ongoing to test the role of primary tumor resection to improve survival in mPCa. Results of ADT as first-line single modality therapy in mPCa are predictably poor.",

            "text": "In this network meta-analysis, eight primary treatments for SHCC were compared through direct and indirect evidence reported in 45 studies involving 11,364 patients. Patients had tumor stages corresponding to BCLC 0 and BCLC A of the Barcelona Clinical Liver cancer (BCLC) staging system. Bayesian network meta-analysis showed that MIS and SR exhibited better OS and RFS outcomes, relative to the other non-surgical treatment methods. In addition, MIS was associated with better outcomes, compared to SR while SBRT was more effective at increasing RFS outcomes, relative to the other non-surgical treatment approaches, whereas TACE was associated with significantly poor RFS* outcomes, compared to the other six treatment methods. Subgroup analysis revealed that RFA was more effective in patients with small nodules (< 2 cm or 3 cm in diameter). Notably, tumor nodule sizes were the main causes of heterogeneity. Borderline observations were made between MIS and CRA for OS (HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.36-1.00), and between MIS and SR for RFS* (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.56-1.00). Studies with larger sample sizes should be conducted to verify these findings. Findings from RCT and non-RCT subgroups were consistent with these findings. Subgroup analyses based on liver status (Child-Pugh score) [87], AFP, vascular invasion (the most important predictors of prognosis [88]), medical comorbidities and tumors sizes at 2 to 3 cm or 3 to 5 cm were not performed due to a lack of sufficient data. Well-designed, large-scale randomized controlled trials, including more subgroup analyses should be conducted. Ranking of the relative efficacy and safety for different treatment approaches provides a basis for making future clinical decisions for the most effective interventions for treatment of SHCC patients. \n\nEORTC developed clinical practice guidelines that recommend SR and MIS as first line treatment options for SHCC [89,90]. Surgical interventions involving the removal of the entire Couinaud segment containing tumors effectively eliminate the primary tumors. Therefore, cancer embolus and microscopic lesions are completely eliminated in patients who undergo surgery [91]. This may explain the relatively higher OS and RFS observed in SHCC patients treated by surgical interventions.",

            "text": "The favourable survival rates may be partly attributable to patient selection criteria with a higher proportion (75%) of patients with a solitary metastasis and only complete resections included in the results [33,37]. Comparing ablation with surgical outcomes fails to recognize that these are frequently not mutually exclusive groups. Eighty percent of the patients in our study also had surgical resection for colorectal lung metastases. This is higher than other published cohorts, which varies from 45 to 53% [15,23]. This is perhaps a reflection of a collaborative MDT approach where The asterisk (*) highlights inclusion of non-colorectal lung metastases complete treatment of the lung metastases with preservation of lung function regardless of underlying fitness is one of the stated aims. Image-guided thermal ablation of lung metastases in our cancer centre acts as an adjunct rather than competitor to the existing surgical resection cancer service in this cohort of patients. \n\nAlthough microwave ablation (MWA) has theoretical advantages over RFA, such as less heat sink effect and potentially more uniform ablation zones in a shorter time [22,[38][39][40], the LUMIRA RCT has found no statistically significant difference between MWA and RFA in terms of survival [41]. In 2019, a meta-analysis of 53 studies showed the 5-year OS rates for RFA-treated patients (n = 738) were higher compared with MWA-treated patients (n = 469) (P \\ 0.001) and treatment with RFA was correlated with a longer median OS of 34.8 months compared to 18.7 for MWA [6]. Confounding factors may be that RFA is better known and has been used for longer, with more reproducible results, whereas MWA is a newer modality with smaller study sample sizes. Larger groups with longer follow-up periods are required before firm conclusions can be drawn. \n\nCurrently, no RCT exists that compares thoracic surgery versus image-guided ablation and will be difficult to achieve.",

            "text": "Interventional oncology (IO) is the youngest offshoot of interventional radiology and the most rapidly growing subspecialty in clinical oncology and health care in general. It has successfully established itself as an essential and independent (fourth) pillar within the firmament of multidisciplinary oncologic care, alongside the three established pillars medical oncology, surgery and radiation oncology. Over the years, multiple locoregional treatment modalities have been added to the toolbox of IO physicians. Especially targeted minimally invasive image-guided tumor ablation, otherwise known as radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or microwave ablation (MWA), has proven to be highly effective against primary as well as metastatic disease throughout the body. Their success is chiefly based on the minimally invasive nature, superior safety and toxicity profile, repeatability and often comparable or superior mid- and long-term oncologic outcomes, compared with conventional systemic therapy and surgical resection. Nowadays, these heat-based ablation techniques are recommended curative-intent treatment options for a variety of cancer types, including colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To date, despite the gradual worldwide adoption of thermal ablation, safe and effective characteristics, and similar survival outcomes after partial hepatectomy, medical oncology related societies generally state that thermal ablation should only be reserved for patients who are not amenable for surgery, due to an impaired general health status and/or high comorbidity score, a history of extensive abdominal surgery, (loco)regional tumor progression after prior liver surgery, and/or deep-seated anatomically unresectable tumors or deep-seated anatomically resectable limited disease otherwise requiring major surgery (parenchyma-sparing). For thermal ablation to be considered a fair alternative treatment option for resectable disease, studies directly comparing surgery to thermal ablation need to be finished first.\n\nThe search towards further optimization of periprocedural management, mainly for the less invasive percutaneous approach, has led to the setup of several comparative cohort studies with the intent to improve long-term oncological outcomes.

Significant efforts and resources have been dedicated in order to develop optimal strategies in breast cancer diagnosis and treatment over the last decades; increased population based screening and improved adjuvant therapies have been able to progressively reduce breast cancer mortality rates. Early diagnosis is increasing in many developed countries thanks to the diffusion of screening programs and improvement of radiological devices despite the negative impact of COVID-19 pandemic (Buonomo et al.) (1). Nowadays, the therapeutic strategies against breast cancer are increasingly customized for each patient and modulated according to clinical features, staging, biologic factors such as hormone receptor status, Ki67, HER2 overexpression; an accurate discussion with each patient about the advantages and issues associated with the chosen treatment should always be performed in a correct decision-making process. However, a multidisciplinary management, involving surgical, medical and radiation oncology, is crucial to define optimal strategy, improve oncological and aesthetic results, increase patient\u2019s quality of life and prolong survival (2, 3). Early-stage breast cancer should usually be treated by primary surgery to the breast and axillary lymph nodes; breast-conserving treatment (breast-conserving surgery (BCS) plus radiotherapy) or mastectomy are the possible surgical options; in both cases, oncological radicality and patient aesthetic satisfaction should always be ensured. The modern breast surgeon should perform the choice of breast-conserving treatment versus mastectomy based on breast volume to cancer volume ratio, multicentricity, presence of mammographic microcalcifications, ability to achieve clear surgical margins and patient wishes; a careful evaluation of the disease by clinical and radiological examination is crucial to select the optimal local treatment. BCS combined with adjuvant radiotherapy is now deemed the gold standard approach for earlystage breast cancer because it permits to preserve the breast without affecting oncologic results;",

            "text": "Although local surgery poses a benefit of survival, it is worth underlining that such therapy is likely not suitable for all patients with metastatic disease. The stratified analysis in this study demonstrated that hysterectomy resulted in survival improvement in cervical cancer patients with metastasis to lung alone and other site or distant LN alone. In line with previous studies, patients with metastasis to pulmonary or distant lymph node alone has remarkably good prognosis and gains survival benefit from aggressive therapy (22,23). Hence, local surgery may be an appropriate treatment option for a carefully selected group of patients with good performance status, symptomatic primary disease and a low metastatic disease burden. Multiple studies have emphasized the risk of a positive surgical margin on prognosis (24,25). Unfortunately, we could not obtain data on surgical margin status from the SEER database. We found that the advantage of surgery did not showed in patients with T4 stage (invasion into neighboring structures such as bladder and rectum), and there were prominent survival differences between women who had hysterectomy and those had a radical hysterectomy. It's well known that a clear surgical margin is difficult to achieve in patients with tumors progression to neighboring organs. Pelvic lymph node dissection would also contribute to lower the tumor burden, and stop cancer cell spreading to distant organs through lymphatic pathway. Consequently, we preferentially hold the opinion that definitive surgery to remove primary tumor clearly vitally improves the therapeutic efficacy by lowering the tumor burden. \n\nAs for treatment, radiotherapy and chemotherapy were also independent prognostic factors for FIGO IVB cervical cancer. Moreover, an aggressive treatment approach that combines chemotherapy or radiation with surgical management of primary tumors may lead to improved survival with abovementioned treatments alone, and the survival advantage of combined treatment over palliative treatment is even greater than that of single treatment add together. Therefore, local surgical combined with systemic therapy is recommended for primary metastatic cervical cancer with good performance. Regrettably, SEER database does not include information on chemotherapy regimen and cycles or radiation field size and dose, which would have allowed us to analyze survival based on chemotherapy modalities as well as the extent of radiotherapy administered. \n\nThere were several inevitable limitations in the present study.",

            "text": "In curative treatment of patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer chemoradiation (CRT) is either performed as neoadjuvant treatment before surgery or as definitive treatment in case of unresectable tumor. Neoadjuvant treatment is performed in patients who are fit to undergo major surgery. However, patients with thoracic squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus who show good response to CRT might have a similar outcome with definitive CRT compared to surgery [153]. Several studies have gathered evidence that 18 F-FDG PET/CT has a high prognostic value in patients undergoing CRT for esophageal cancer [154,155] and can therefore be useful to guide treatment decisions. \n\nRT planning in patients with esophageal cancer is challenging since the primary tumor is often poorly visible on standard morphological imaging with CT alone. Given the submucosal spread of the tumor, diagnostic modalities such as barium swallow, gastroesophagoscopy or MRI are frequently used to further determine the exact tumor extend. While the additional effect of 18 F-FDG PET/CT on primary tumor volume delineation seems limited with different studies reporting conflicting results either with benefit [156] or no benefit [157] of PET/CT over conventional imaging alone. In contrast, the effect on metabolic imaging on the identification of involved nodes has been shown [157,158]. 18 F-FDG PET/CT has a high specificity and sensitivity in detecting involved nodes in esophageal cancer and should therefore be considered for pre-treatment imaging in patients with esophageal cancer [159].",

            "text": "Last decades, cancers of the hypopharynx are, like cancers of the larynx, increasingly being treated with non-surgical larynx-preserving treatment modalities (radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy), obviously leading to a decrease in the rate of laryngopharyngectomies (11). Besides, early stage hypopharyngeal tumors, although relatively rare, are increasingly being treated with larynx sparing, minimal invasive surgery such as transoral laser microsurgery (TLM) or transoral robotic surgery (TORS) (12). However, laryngopharyngectomy is still a valuable treatment option for resectable failures of primary organ preservation protocols or in very advanced primary situations, in which a non-surgical organ preserving treatment regimen is unlikely to yield functional organ preservation. Of interest, a recent retrospective analysis of almost 4,000 patients with  hypopharyngeal cancer (all stages) who were identified in the SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) database, revealed an overall survival benefit for patients treated with combined surgery and radiotherapy when compared to other treatment modalities (11). In this analysis, 5-year overall survival of patients who underwent upfront surgery with adjuvant radiotherapy was 34.5% compared to 22.6% for patients who received upfront radiotherapy (with or without chemotherapy) (p < 0.001) (11). This survival benefit for the primarily surgically treated group could not be confirmed in a later retrospective  comparative study comparing oncologic outcomes between 34 patients treated with upfront CRT vs. 57 patients treated with primary surgery followed by adjuvant RT or CRT. All patients had stage III-IV hypopharyngeal SCC and no differences between both groups were observed in 5-year local control, DFS and OS, while the functional larynx-preservation rate was higher in the CRT group (88.2 vs. 29.8%) (13). In our upfront surgery patient cohort, estimated 2-year and 5-year OS rates were 45.2% (SE = 8.3%) and 24.1% (SE = 7.3%) respectively.",

            "text": "Multimodal treatment is a basic oncologic principle that incorporates surgery, radiotherapy (RT), and chemotherapy [1,2]. It has proven survival benefits for most cancer types [3][4][5]. However, a range of single modalities is generally recommended for treating each stage of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Nevertheless, the multimodal approach may also be considered according to the disease characteristics in individual cases.\n\nThe Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system is most commonly used to stage HCC. It is endorsed by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the European Association for the Study of the Liver. Guidelines based on the BCLC staging system recommend a single modality as the standard treatment for each stage [6]. However, single-modality treatment frequently results in local or distant failure in the treatment of non-early-stage HCCs, which constitute the majority of cases [7].\n\nThe National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines recommend externalbeam RT as a locoregional therapy for potentially resectable and unresectable HCC patients [8]. The Korean Liver Cancer Study Group (KLCSG) guidelines, established in 2003 [9] and updated in 2014 [10], recommend RT depending on the stage of HCC [10]. Both the 2003 and 2014 KLCSG guidelines support RT for the treatment of HCC because RT can exert an independent ablative effect and generally complements other treatments.\n\nThis article reviews the usage of RT in HCC treatment and discusses the clinical application of RT according to the 2014 KLCSG guidelines. Ongoing clinical trials and the optimal selection of RT as a part of multimodal approaches to HCC treatment are also discussed.",

            "title": "Radiotherapeutic Strategies in the Management of Low-Risk Prostate Cancer",
            "text": "Prostate cancer is the most common noncutaneous malignancy among men in the U.S., with more than 180,000 new cases diagnosed each year [1]. Due to widespread screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA), prostate cancer is diagnosed at a much earlier stage than previously possible and the majority of the patients are diagnosed with low-risk disease [2,3]. For these patients, regardless of treatment modality, excellent outcomes can be expected with a very low risk of mortality from the disease [4]. There are three standard treatment approaches for patients with low-risk prostate cancer: active surveillance, surgery, and radiotherapy. For certain patients, including those who are elderly and with significant comorbidities, active surveillance may be preferable; this approach is discussed separately in this issue of the journal. The two main therapy options are radical prostatectomy and radiotherapy. Although data formally comparing the two modalities are scarce, analysis of several large institutional series suggests equally favorable outcomes for low-risk prostate cancer [5,6,7]. \n\nRadiation is an important treatment modality for prostate cancer and there exists a diverse array of radiotherapeutic strategies to treat the disease, including conventional external-beam radiotherapy and brachytherapy. There has been substantial progress in the field of radiation oncology in recent years, especially with regards to tumor localization and precise delivery of radiation. Historically, it was challenging to deliver high doses of radiation to the prostate without incurring significant toxicity, since the gland is situated in such close proximity to the bladder and the rectum. However, more recently, the prostate has become a disease site that showcases the potential of new technologies in radiation oncology. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy has allowed the sculpting of radiation doses around complex target volumes and sparing of neighboring organs. Innovations in image-guided radiotherapy have led to accurate localization of the target before each treatment, and target coverage and normal tissue sparing have improved even further. Importantly, the integration of these more advanced technologies has been shown to result in improvements in both disease control and associated toxicity [8,9]. Radiotherapeutic options in the management of low-risk prostate cancer will be reviewed here.",

            "text": "In this large, population-based study, patterns of treatment and outcomes of elderly patients with potentially curable EC were comprehensively analyzed. The results showed that the usage ratios of trimodality therapy were decreased with the increase in age, CRT was mostly adapted in patients with locally advancedstage EC, and RT alone was also occasionally employed, especially in patients aged \u226580 years. The survival analysis indicated that all the treatment patterns had survival benefits in elderly patients compared to Obs. The use of surgery or CRT_ +S was associated with improved OS in the elderly EC patients, and CRT was superior to RT or CT alone. The results were stable across subgroup analyses stratified by most factors, including sex, clinical stage, histological subtype, and tumor location, demonstrating the reliability of our conclusions. In younger patients, surgery-based trimodality therapy has been the standard treatment for locally advanced EC (19,20). However, elderly patients tend to have a decline in physiological function and a high prevalence of chronic diseases, such as high  blood pressure, diabetes, and cardiovascular system diseases, which make them difficult to respond to surgical trauma and recover slowly (21). Consequently, elderly patients undergoing esophagectomy for cancer are reported to have a significantly higher risk of postoperative mortality, especially in patients aged 75 years or older (7,22,23). Hence, elderly patients with EC should be cautiously evaluated and selected for surgery (24). In fact, only one-third of patients in our cohort underwent surgical resection, and the number of patients who underwent surgery decreased dramatically with increasing age. In this study, a significantly small number of patients (<10%) aged >80 years underwent surgery, reflecting concerns about postoperative morbidity and the underuse of surgery in elderly patients with EC.\n\nIn the survival analysis, elderly patients who underwent CRT+S lived significantly longer than those who received other treatment patterns, including CRT or surgery alone. The advantage of trimodality therapy was stable in both EAC and ESCC and across stages II to III.In consistence with our findings, a series of other retrospective studies also supported the use of surgery in elderly patients with EC, and esophagectomy was found to be associated with improved survival, even with increased risk of complications",

            "text": "In 2020, breast cancer was the most diagnosed female cancer, with an estimated 2.3 million new cases (11.7%) globally.It is the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths, accounting for 6.9% of cancer deaths worldwide (1).Since 1988-1995, mortality from breast cancer has been declining sharply in most high-income countries (2).The inception of mammographic screening programs has led to increasing diagnosis of small breast cancers, many of which have favorable biological characteristics (3,4).Some of these tumors have excellent long-term outcomes, with 10-year breast cancer specific survival approaching 100% (5).It is likely that such tumors may never become symptomatic within a patient's lifetime due to their indolent nature and may thus represent overdiagnosis.There has been much debate around the extent of overdiagnosis within mammographic screening programs.In the UK, an Independent Panel Review of the UK NHS Breast Screening Program concluded that, for every breast cancer death prevented by screening, around three cancers were overdiagnosed and consequently overtreated (6).However, despite improvements in the understanding of tumor biology, there remains no way of identifying those small (T1a and T1b) tumors with broadly favorable characteristics (e.g., hormone receptor positive [HR+] and HER2\u2212) that are likely to progress or to become life threatening.These patients are all generally treated the same manner, usually with breastconserving surgery, adjuvant radiotherapy, and endocrine therapy.These treatment modalities have associated physical and psychological morbidities for patients and costs for healthcare providers (7)(8)(9).Thus, there is increasing interest in the de-escalation of loco-regional therapies for small screen-detected tumors.\n\nNumerous image-guided ablative techniques have been described for the minimally invasive management of small tumors (10).By their nature, however, majority of these techniques do not provide tumor tissue for histopathological assessment and often require specialized equipment and expertise, which is not readily available.However, vacuum-assisted excision (VAE) is a commonly used technique for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes and can be carried out under local anesthesia and image guidance.",

            "text": "Prostate cancer has a very high incidence, especially in the elderly. Nearly 20% of prostate cancer patients are aged \u226575 years (1). Because prostate cancer is predominantly seen in elderly people, the current guideline recommends determining the treatment strategy by the expected life expectancy of each patient (2). Even elderly patients should receive appropriate and curative treatment for prostate cancer, however, depending on their risk level. International recommendations state that the same treatment should be considered for the elderly as for the young, provided physical and cognitive functions are preserved in the former (3).\n\nRadical treatment methods for prostate cancer include surgery, brachytherapy, and external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). There is almost no difference between the treatment outcomes of surgery and radiation therapy (RT) for early-stage prostate cancer (4). However, surgery is an invasive treatment and requires receiving general anaesthesia. Thus, its recommendation for elderly patients is relatively infrequent. RT, especially EBRT, plays an important role as a noninvasive treatment modality for prostate cancer patients.\n\nIn recent years, the development of image-guided intensitymodulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) has made it possible to deliver high doses of radiation to the prostate while reducing toxicity (5), especially rectal toxicity. RT is suitable for elderly patients because of its less invasiveness compared to surgery. However, there are only few reports of long-term follow-up after RT for prostate cancer in the elderly population.\n\nIn this study, we conducted a retrospective cohort analysis to evaluate the long-term treatment outcomes and adverse events associated with RT for prostate cancer patients aged \u226575 years.",

            "title": "The State-of-the-Art and Perspectives of Laser Ablation for Tumor Treatment",
            "text": "LA is an emerging discipline in minimally invasive interventional tumor therapy, and its safety and efficacy have been largely confirmed. It stands as a promising surgical alternative for various cancers. Compared to conventional treatment, LA can reduce recovery time, minimize blood loss, and lower risk. However, its limited laser penetration depth restricts its suitability to superficial tumor tissue ablation [146]. Therefore, improving the laser source is one of the future directions of LA, along with expanding the clinical applications of LA to other fields, continuing to investigate the interaction between laser and tissue, elucidating the laser treatment mechanisms of different wavelengths and laser parameters, refining the targeting of tumor laser treatment, and using it to treat new diseases and viral diseases. \n\nThis paper focuses on the application of LA to tumors and provides a thorough discussion of the mechanism and biological effects of tumor LA treatment, image guidance, robot assistance, and other aspects. Effective simulation of laser parameters and elucidation of biological effect mechanisms will have a significant impact on the LA effect in terms of the LA mechanism. For precise LA treatment, it is necessary to elucidate the laser tissue interaction mechanism of tumors in various positions and tissue structures. Image guidance can provide essential structural and functional information for preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative ablation outcomes, thereby providing the technical methods for the accurate and effective evaluation of ablation effects, particularly in preoperative planning, intraoperative navigation, and postoperative evaluation. \n\nImage-guided LA has been proven to have promising prospects in tumor treatment, with confirmed efficacy and safety [ 74,101,114,127], and is changing the available treatment options for patients. Nevertheless, present clinical cases mostly rely on single-modality imaging for guidance, which may offer limited structural and functional data of afflicted tissues. In addition, image resolution, penetration depth, imaging speed, and field of view (FOV) are important factors for real-time outcome visualization. Consequently, multimodal imaging-guided LA is also one of the future development directions. Multimodal imaging can reduce misdiagnosis rates, enhance the recognition efficiency of tumor tissue, and provide anatomical and functional information of tumors with high spatial/temporal resolution [147]. Integrated multimodal imaging and LA treatment can substantially boost diagnostic and therapeutic efficiency.",

Some analytical studies which compare the outcomes of different surgical treatments have been published, but these are generally non-randomized, retrospective observational studies with low numbers (Mendenhall et al, 1988;Weber et al, 1990;Davidson et al, 1991;Mitchell and Crighton, 1993;Fein et al, 1994;Nisi et al, 1998). \n\nRadiotherapy fractionation protocols used in the UK have varied widely and been determined more by the equipment available than by evidence of effectiveness (Priestman et al, 1989). There has been a move towards combined surgical and radiotherapy treatment for advanced UAT cancers (Mendenhall et al, 1988;Glaholm, 1998;Nisi et al, 1998). Compared with single modality treatment combined surgery and radiotherapy has been found to improve outcomes for advanced tongue (Weber et al, 1990), pharyngeal (Bentzen et al, 1991) and laryngeal cancers (Vermund et al, 1990). Radiotherapy is routinely given post-operatively as it is associated with a lower recurrence rate than preoperatively (Tupchong, 1991). There is evidence from a number of studies that interruption in radiotherapy treatment and extension of treatment beyond 30 days because of interruptions reduce control rates for cancers of the oropharynx and larynx (Amdur et al, 1989;Slaladowski et al, 1994;Duncan et al, 1996;Wang et al, 1996). \n\nThere is some controversy about which treatments are appropriate for which cancers. Several studies have shown better functional and quality of life outcomes for patients treated with radiotherapy than for those treated with surgery for base of tongue cancers (Harrison et al, 1994;Moore et al, 1996;Zelefsky et al, 1996), buccopharyngeal cancers (Morton et al, 1984;Morton, 1997) and laryngeal cancers (Stewart et al, 1998), but others show better results for surgery (Fein et al, 1994).",

            "text": "Clinical TNM staging were similar between ethnicity groups. In this pilot study, we retrospectively reviewed CT imaging of 107 patients with gastric cancer treated within a safety-net hospital system to assess the utility of CT as a single imaging modality for clinical staging. For patients who underwent surgery, we found overall minimal agreement between clinical and pathological T-staging. This agreement improved for T3/T4a tumors and for Hispanic/Latino patients but remained weak. The presence of gastric distention did not improve agreement. Hispanic/Latino patients displayed predominately infiltrative tumor morphology whereas non-Hispanic/Latino patients had higher rates of polypoid morphology. These findings were used to develop an interpretation checklist for reporting gastric cancer characteristics to guide clinical staging. \n\nComplete surgical resection with negative margins remains the gold standard of gastric cancer care with curative intent [19]. \n\nFor patients with locally advanced disease, neoadjuvant chemotherapy is now the standard of care in the United States and has been shown to increase the likelihood of successful R0 resection, disease-free survival, and overall survival [8,9,20,21]. Given the progress in available therapeutic options for specified stages of disease, selection of the proper imaging modality to accurately clinically stage and develop an initial treatment strategy is critical [4,5,17]. Under-staging disease may lead to inappropriate attempts to treat with endoscopic mucosal resection or a lack of treatment with neoadjuvant therapy, while overstaging disease may result in treatment with toxic chemotherapy agents upfront with little benefit or an overly invasive surgical approach [8,9]. \n\nEach imaging modality for gastric cancer has distinct advantages and disadvantages. Routine CT, for example, is widely accessible and requires a short examination time, but has limited ability to differentiate between layers of the gastric wall [4,8,22]. Multi-detector row CT gastrography may improve accuracy for T-staging but is not available at most centers and increases healthcare costs [23]. EUS offers improved differentiation of the layers of the gastric wall but can be highly operator-dependent and is an invasive procedure [4,7,8,20].",

            "text": "Management of epithelial ovarian cancer is predicated upon optimal cytoreductive surgery, with less than 1 cm of residual disease. Recurrence and overall survival improves with further cytoreduction incrementally, with microscopic residual disease followed a platinum-taxane combination chemotherapy infusion [29] results in the greatest overall and progression-free survival. Most commonly ovarian cancer is identified at an advanced stage often requiring radical surgical procedures to achieve \"optimal\" status. Minimallyinvasive surgeries for maximal cytoreduction of ovarian cancers have been attempted since the 1990s. Whether roboticassisted surgery improves upon the ability to surgically cytoreduce ovarian cancer is an open question. While the improved ergonomics may aid in these type radical surgery, other limitations inherent in the robotic platform-namely the inability to simultaneously operate in the pelvis and abdomen-remain a significant disadvantage. \n\nRobotic surgery for ovarian cancer management remains relatively untested (Table 3). In the limited experience to date, blood loss and postoperative complications of bowel injury and wound dehiscence are infrequent (Table 3). Port site relapses have not been reported routinely among the early investigational studies. A single manuscript has compared robotic surgery to traditional means of ovarian cancer staging surgery. In this case control study, 25 patients undergoing primary staging for epithelial ovarian cancers were compared to similar patients treated by laparoscopy and laparotomy. The authors concluded that laparoscopic or robotic surgery is reasonable approach for primary tumor excision in patients with ovarian cancers. It must be emphasized that these patients were highly selected and their results are not likely to apply to all patients with ovarian cancer. The authors themselves noted that for patients with advanced disease requiring multiple complicated additional procedures, laparotomy remains the optimal surgical approach [23]. \n\nClinical trials have demonstrated that intraperitoneal routes of chemotherapy administration should be strongly considered for treatment of women with intrabdominal spread of ovarian cancer.",

            "text": "Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer worldwide (incidence rate of 10.2%), of which over 700,000 patients will be annually diagnosed with tumors localized to the rectum [1].Those with locally advanced rectal cancer typically receive neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy (nCRT) followed by total mesorectal excision (TME) surgery, as the standard-of-care treatment protocol in the US [2].While the goal of nCRT is to down-stage rectal tumors prior to surgery (occurring in ~50-60% of rectal tumors [3]), determining the exact extent of tumor regression after nCRT is critical for better personalizing interventions in rectal cancers.For instance, minimally invasive procedures [4] could be adopted in patients exhibiting marked tumor stage regression (T-stage 0-2, with minimal or no tumor extent within the rectal wall), thus reducing associated morbidities of bleeding or infections [5,6].By contrast, chemoradiated tumors which still extend outside of the rectum into the perirectal fat and surrounding structures (T-stage 3-4) need to be accurately targeted for aggressive resection [7] and could be recommended adjuvant therapy to ensure optimal patient survival [8].\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is routinely acquired both prior to as well as following nCRT to non-invasively assess rectal tumor extent in vivo [9].As compared to less routinely used dynamic [10] or diffusion [11] MRI sequences which capture functional information, the clinically standard T2-weighted (T2w) MRI sequence offers high-resolution in vivo structural detail of the rectum and surrounding structures (lumen, mesorectum).Under the current protocol where all patients undergo surgery, post-nCRT T2w MRI is used to identify disease extent, plan surgical procedures, and thus guide patient management [9].However, expert restaging of tumor extent on post-nCRT T2w MRI has relatively poor agreement with \"ground truth\" pathologic stage (MRI sensitivity of ~52% when compared to excised specimens) due to the difficulties in visual identification of residual tumor on imaging [12,13].",

            "text": "Nevertheless, there is a lack of consensus regarding the most appropriate treatment modality for early cervical cancer presenting with pelvic nodal involvement on imaging. Carlson et al. analyzed the patterns of selecting therapy for patients with early-stage cervical cancer using the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database from 1983 to 2009 [18]. They found that 33.1% of 10,933 women with early cervical cancer continue to undergo adjuvant radiotherapy after surgery. Thus, to avoid unplanned combined modality treatment, they suggested that further effort is needed to identify the pretreatment risk stratification, particularly pretreatment nodal involvement. Radiotherapy was recommended as the initial treatment suggested for patients with risk factors. To our knowledge, this is the first report comparing the oncologic outcomes of definitive radiotherapy and surgery, focusing on stage IIIC1 patients according to the revised 2018 FIGO guidelines. \n\nImaging and surgical approach were the available options for pretreatment evaluation of the pelvic nodal status, and both methods are used for staging in the recently revised FIGO stage [22]. MRI detects lymph node metastasis based on the measurement of node size and/or morphology. A specificity of 97% is reported when nodes are defined as metastatic in cases of short-axis larger than one centimeter [23]. In early cervical cancer, the positive predictive value and accuracy of MRI for detecting lymph node metastasis were reportedly 51-76% and 67-76% [7,24]. Lee et al. proposed a treatment decision model based on pretreatment MRI findings [25]. Applying MRI-based treatment selection strategy to their cohort, 86 out of 254 were selected for definitive CRT instead of surgery. This change resulted in fewer patients requiring tri-modality therapy (30.3% vs. 9.8%). PET-CT provides functional, metabolism-based information, and it is considered more accurate for the detection of nodal metastasis and unexpected metastasis [26]. Previous studies reported the positive predictive value and accuracy of PET-CT for the detection of nodal involvement to be 47-78.2% and 65-98%, respectively [7,26,27].",

            "text": "We confirmed this finding of a higher BED in smaller tumors, although we applied strict selection criteria with tumors < 5 cm as opposed to other reports of the NCDB, including large lesions up to 17 cm [23]. Our analyses showed no further benefit of SBRT compared with different types of surgical resections, as the use of SBRT has been suggested to be an alternative to extended resections, as shown in other cancer entities (e.g., non-small-cell lung cancer) [43,44]. Nevertheless, there are no clinical practice guidelines of the American Society for Radiation Oncology for the SBRT treatment of HCC and a consensus on BED doses is lacking. \n\nThere are several limitations of our study. As a retrospective analysis of a large database including several U.S. institutions, our results might be affected by inter-institutional heterogeneity with respect to the patients included and the treatments applied [45]. During the study period, significant refinements of the SBRT technique have been made globally, including technological advances in radiation therapy delivery systems (e.g., volumetric modulation arc therapy), the use of image-guided radiation therapy (e.g., CT, MRI, and PET scans), and motion management techniques, which resulted in better outcomes [46]. Yet, we did not observe a survival benefit of patients treated with SBRT between 2010-2015 and 2004-2009. This might be due to heterogenous application of SBRT techniques between institutions, including the shift to hypofractionation from three to five fractions over time, as well as the use of heterogenous SBRT doses, and the results should be considered therefore cautiously. Moreover, the lack of data on known prognostic variables such as patients' liver function treatment-associated toxicity and postoperative liver surgery complications [47][48][49], as well as the number and location of lesions (i.e., centrally located tumors with potential vascular invasion), and other second-line treatments after primary surgery or SBRT needs to be mentioned as a limitation of our study that might have introduced bias. Further, there are no data on the treatment of recurrent disease or data on local tumor control.",

            "text": "Particularly, the treatment is uniform within each HNSCC entity, being surgery usually preferred for oral cavity and paranasal sinus, and RT for nasopharyngeal carcinomas. Nevertheless, the choice of treatment modality should be based on the assessment of functional outcomes and perceived relative morbidity for each patient as well as institutional and patient preferences and experience [9,12]. Usually, early-stage cancers have a favorable prognosis with high cure rates, and the treatment improves long-term survival. However, patients with locally advanced HNSCC cancer carry a high risk of recurrence, distant metastases, and poor prognosis [1]. For locoregional advanced HNSCC, standard treatment often includes surgery plus adjuvant RT, or chemoradiotherapy (CRT), or primary CRT alone. Generally, surgery is preferred for the oral cavity followed by RT or CRT, while for other sites, surgery is reserved for smaller accessible primary tumors or for those whose response to induction CRT was poor. Particularly, concomitant CRT resulted in greater locoregional control and improved OS than RT alone, irrespective of the tumor location. Nonetheless, treatment decisions need to be individualized and carefully evaluated by a multispecialty team in a tumor board and several aspects should be con-sidered: morbidity, toxic effects, and preservation of organ function, among others [9,12]. However, around 50% of patients with locally advanced HNSCC develop recurrence after primary treatment with metastatic, local, or regional disease and have a poor prognosis with a median overall survival (OS) under 12 months (six to nine months without treatment) [1]. Treatment of these patients is complex and requires the evaluation of tumor-and patient-related factors for selecting the optimal combination and sequencing of treatments. Patients with locoregional recurrence may be candidates for surgical salvage, and those patients not amenable to surgery are candidates for curative-intent RT or re-irradiation with or without chemotherapy depending on the time since prior treatment and related toxicity.",

To achieve this goal, we conducted an international multicenter study from 12 independent cohorts with a total of 1,682 cancer patients recruited from the US, Europe, and Japan (Supplementary Table 1). Our analysis included three cancer types (i.e., lung, breast, and brain malignancies); and two imaging modalities (i.e., CT and MRI). All patients had a pathologically confirmed diagnosis of primary malignancy, and had received standard therapies including surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and/or hormonal therapy. We collected their pre-treatment radiological scans and, if available, tumor molecular profiles, clinicopathological and outcome data (Supplementary Tables 2-4). To rigorously assess reproducibility of our findings, we divided the 12 primary cohorts into discovery and independent validation sets as stratified by cancer types and imaging modalities. Further, we assessed the clinical relevance of the imaging subtypes in a separate cohort of 102 advanced lung cancer patients treated with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint blockade (Supplementary Table 5).",

            "text": "S quamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx (OPC) is the most prevalent type of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and is increasing gradually, most likely due to the prolongation of the average life span and increases in cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption [1,2]. The incidence in men is 2-5 times greater than that in women. The incidence and death of pharyngeal cancer is about 11,800 and 2,180 people in 2007, respectively, but this incidence varies markedly between countries [3]. \n\nThe management of patients with OPC remains controversial. The predominant treatment modalities consist of surgery, radiation therapy (RT), and chemoradiotherapy (CRT), individually or in combination [4][5][6][7][8][9][10]. Although single-modality therapy with radiation or surgery can achieve similar loco-regional control for the early stage, patients with more advanced disease (stage III or IV) have been treated with surgery followed by RT or CRT. The survival figures for advanced-stage OPC have remained moderate despite the use of radical combined modality treatments. In recent meta-analysis for advanced OPC, tumor control and survival did not differ significantly between groups undergoing surgery with or without RT and RT with or without neck dissection (ND). However, patients who underwent surgery with or without RT exhibited a higher rate of severe or fatal complications [9]. Recently, the utility of concurrent CRT for OPC has been reported [10]. In terms of complications, RT with CRT could become a first-line treatment for OPC. \n\nOutcome indicators in patients with HNSCC, including OPC, have traditionally been derived from clinical and pathologic features [11,12]. The identification of additional prognostic factors for survival may allow the development of individualized strategies that lead to improved survival outcomes. Recent reports have described that pre-treatment positron emission tomography (PET) using 2-deoxy-[F-18] fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) for HNSCC including OPC predicted loco-regional control and survival outcome [13][14][15][16][17].",

Commercial units became available in 2014 that allowed for lesion visualization prior to, during, and after treatment. A recently published study by Yu et al. using US-SRT (\"IGSRT\") to treat 2917 earlystage keratinocytic cancers yielded a high local control (LC) rate of 99\u00b73% [8].

In cases of higher volume cases, optimal management typically involves a combination of surgery followed by postoperative radiation therapy. Shelan et al reported that for patients with advanced-stage laryngeal cancer, the locoregional control rates at 5 years were 95% for primary surgery and 50% for primary concurrent chemoradiotherapy, indicating a statistically significant difference (P < 0.01) [17]. Helical Tomotherapy for LSCC World J Oncol. 2024;15(1):136-142 \n\nFor early-stage treatment, several treatment options exist. Gong et al reported the clinical outcomes of transoral laser microsurgery in patients with early-stage glottic carcinoma [18]. They reported a 5-year OS of 88.4%, which is not statistically different from other surgical modalities such as vertical partial laryngectomy and cricohyoidoepiglottopexy. Hanna et al conducted multivariable analysis of early-stage LSCC from the National Cancer Database investigating clinical outcome of transoral robotic surgery [19]. Transoral robotic surgery had the higher 5-year OS, comparing with open surgery (68.7% vs. 59.1%; P = 0.01). \n\nFor advanced-stage treatment, one of the most widely used concurrent regimens is triweekly cisplatin administration [20]. As a result of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 91-11 trial, concurrent chemoradiotherapy was proposed as a new standard treatment for functional preservation in advancedstage LSCC [21]. However, in the long-term follow-up study of RTOG 91-11, Forastiere et al reported that it is necessary to fully recognize that while chemotherapy and radiation therapy can improve cure rates, they are also associated with a high frequency of late-stage complications [22]. The late toxicities affecting voice and swallowing function among the treatment groups could affect non-cancer-related deaths.",

            "text": "Simple Summary Cure is the goal of treatment in early primary liver cancer with surgical resection and ablation therapy being the two most common modalities used. This real-world multi-centre Australian study demonstrates that surgical treatment results in superior outcomes. We observed a significantly reduced risk of death from any cause and of recurrent liver cancer after controlling for factors such as initial tumour burden, liver disease severity and other medical comorbidities. Our study provides compelling evidence to recommend surgery for suitable patients to achieve the best possible outcomes. Abstract The optimal treatment approach in very-early and early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is not precisely defined, and there is ambiguity in the literature around the comparative efficacy of surgical resection versus ablation as curative therapies for limited disease. We performed this real-world propensity-matched, multi-centre cohort study to assess for differences in survival outcomes between those undergoing resection and those receiving ablation. Patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) 0/A HCC first diagnosed between 1 January 2016 and 31 December 2020 who received ablation or resection as initial treatment were included in the study. A total of 450 patients were included in the study from 10 major liver centres including two transplant centres. Following propensity score matching using key covariates, 156 patients were available for analysis with 78 in each group. Patients who underwent resection had significantly improved overall survival (log-rank test p = 0.023) and local recurrence-free survival (log rank test p = 0.027) compared to those who received ablation. Based on real-world data, our study supports the use of surgical resection in preference to ablation as first-line curative therapy in appropriately selected BCLC 0/A HCC patients.",

            "text": "Simple Summary Pancreatic cancer is a highly aggressive disease associated with poor clinical outcomes. It is the seventh leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Due to the lack of obvious signs and symptoms until advanced disease, establishing an early diagnosis is often difficult. EUS is the imaging modality of choice to establish a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. However, over the years, EUS has evolved to have therapeutic applications in the management of pancreatic cancer. EUS-guided fine needle injection of anti-tumoral agents, EUS-guided radiotherapy, and EUS-guided ablation techniques have become vital tools for endoscopic oncologists, especially in the management of locally advanced pancreatic cancer. These EUS-guided techniques offer high efficacy and demonstrate an excellent safety profile. However, they have not yet become routine practice due to the lack of long-term efficacy outcomes. Hence, additional studies are needed to investigate the long-term clinical outcomes and establish standardized procedural protocols for these techniques. Abstract Pancreatic cancer is a highly lethal disease with an aggressive clinical course. Patients with pancreatic cancer are usually asymptomatic until significant progression of their disease. Additionally, there are no effective screening guidelines for pancreatic cancer in the general population. This leads to a delay in diagnosis and treatment, resulting in poor clinical outcomes and low survival rates. Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS) is an indispensable tool for the diagnosis and staging of pancreatic cancer. In the modern era, with exponential advancements in technology and device innovation, EUS is also being increasingly used in a variety of therapeutic interventions. In the context of pancreatic cancer where therapies are limited due to the advanced stage of the disease at diagnosis, EUS-guided interventions offer new and innovative options. Moreover, due to their minimally invasive nature and ability to provide real-time images for tumor localization and therapy, they are associated with fewer complication rates compared to conventional open and laparoscopic approaches. In this article, we detail the most current and important therapeutic applications of EUS for pancreatic cancer, namely EUS-guided Fine Needle Injections, EUS-guided Radiotherapy, and EUS-guided Ablations. Furthermore, we also discuss the feasibility and safety profile of each intervention in patients with pan",

            "text": "The wide application of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening has led not only to a higher incidence of prostate cancer, but also to a profound stage migration [1]. With this remarkable stage migration, 91% of cases are being detected as clinically localized prostate cancer, whereas the proportion of metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis was just 4% in the United States in 2009 [2]. Because the natural history of clinically localized prostate cancer varies from indolent disease to highly aggressive disease, the risk stratification of disease poses a significant challenge to the physician who treats patients with clinically localized prostate cancer. The potential aggressiveness of each tumor and the general health, life expectancy, and quality of life preferences of each patient must be assessed prior to selecting treatment. Although the optimal treatment for clinically localized prostate cancer has not been established because of a lack of randomized controlled trials, both radical pros-tatectomy (RP) and radiation therapy (RT) have excellent outcomes for low-and intermediate-risk disease. However, there is no consensus on the optimal treatment for high-risk localized prostate cancer, and much debate exists regarding the ideal treatment approach [3]. Most urologists recommend androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) plus external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT), with only about 36% of high-risk patients initially treated with RP [4]. The aim of this article is to enable physicians to identify patients with high-risk localized prostate cancer and to review current data on the role of RP monotherapy for these patients. We have also reviewed current data about multi-modality therapies for patients with high-risk prostate cancer, including RP combined with neoadjuvant or adjuvant ADT and/or RT.",

            "text": "Cervical cancer ranks fourth among the most frequently occurring types of cancer in women, accounting for an estimated 604,127 cases and 341,831 deaths worldwide in 2020 [1]. This disease is a critical global health issue, with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) representing the most common histologic subtype. However, the incidence of adenocarcinoma (AC) has been steadily rising in recent decades, particularly among younger women, and now comprises approximately 20-25% of all cervical cancers [2,3]. This trend is concerning because AC is associated with worse outcomes and is less responsive to standard treatments compared to SCC [3,4]. Despite this, there are currently no clear differences in treatment between AC and SCC outlined in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines [5]. \n\nEarly-stage cervical cancer is primarily treated with surgery or radiotherapy (RT). Surgery is generally reserved for early-stage disease, fertility preservation, and smaller lesions such as stage IA, IB1, IB2, and selected IIA1 [5,6]. Several studies have demonstrated that surgery is the optimal local treatment modality for patients with early-stage cervical AC [3,7]. Traditionally, locally advanced disease has included patients with stage IIB to IVA disease. However, an increasing number of oncologists now classify patients with IB3 and IIA2 disease as advanced disease. The panel agrees that concurrent chemoradiation (CCRT) is usually the primary treatment of choice for stages IB3 to IVA disease based on the results of 5 randomized clinical trials [5,8,9]. Although few studies have evaluated treatment specifically for AC, they are typically treated in a similar manner to SCC [4,10,11]. Hence, there is currently a dearth of level 1 evidence to provide guidance for managing patients with locally advanced cervical AC, resulting in limited understanding of the optimal approach to such management. The ideal management strategy for cervical AC continues to be a matter of debate among healthcare professionals, particularly with regard to whether stages IB3 to IVA of cervical AC should be managed differently than SCC, and which therapeutic options should be considered.",

However, due to insidious onset and rapid progress of pancreatic cancer, most patients had vascular involvement by the tumour at the first time, where surgery could not be given first priority. 4][5] For patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC), chemoradiotherapy may be the optimal modality. Recently, stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has been accepted as an alternative of intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) due to the image-guided technique that results in highly precise delivery of doses, rapid dose fall-off outside targets and short courses without delay of subsequent treatment. 6 8][9] Our previous studies have clarified that biologically effective dose (BED, \u03b1/\u03b2=10) \u226560 Gy may be associated with better prognosis. 10 11 Additionally, it was also demonstrated that BED 10 >70 Gy was the only predictor of improved overall survival (OS) in another report. 12 Nevertheless, a recent meta-analysis has clarified that BED 10 >70 Gy did not correlate with improvement of 1-year local control (LC) rate. 13 herefore, this study aims to compare the",

            "text": "In global cancer statistics, cervical cancer ranks fourth for both incidence and mortality in women (1). In China, cervical cancer had a significant upward trend in age-standardized incidence rates (2).\n\nStages IB2, IIA2, IIB, IIIA, IIIB, and IVA (FIGO 2009) cervical cancers are all locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC). To treat this type of cervical cancer, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines recommend the external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), concurrent platinum-containing chemotherapy, and brachytherapy (category 1) (3). As a critical component of the definitive radiation therapy, brachytherapy technology has been rapidly developing in recent years. In consideration of significant changes in the tumor regresses and the topography of the target and organs at risk during the course of treatment (4), image-guided adaptive brachytherapy (IGABT) became an individualized treatment method for patients with LACC. IGABT improves overall survival (OS) and generates a high rate of local tumor control (LC) with a moderate rate of treatment-related morbidity (5)(6)(7)(8). IGABT has been developing particularly in Europe, North America, and Asia (9).\n\nThe preferred imaging technologies for IGABT for LACC are CT and MRI. Compared with CT, advantages of MRI lie in the soft tissue contrast and in discrimination of cervical cancer from normal uterine and adjacent tissue (10). This helps to define the tumor shrinkage and topography after EBRT (11). The NCCN guidelines recommend MRI as the best imaging modality to determine soft tissue and parametrial involvement in patients with advanced tumors (3). Even so, it is difficult for every institution to gain MRI access for each individual brachytherapy fraction (7,(12)(13)(14)(15)(16)(17). Due to the limited MRI availability, some institutions use MRI only in some of the brachytherapy fractions (12,(16)(17)(18). The use of MRI-guided adaptive brachytherapy (MR-IGABT) in each fraction is still limited (18). The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcomes of MR-",

            "text": "This subgroup exhibits prognostic factors such as old age (> 20 years), male, large tumors (> 5 cm), and spindle cell type, which are the same as those of the optimal subgroup. However, this subgroup also includes the early stages of cancer (SEER stage 1), tumors located in the trunk or pelvis, and patients treated with both surgery and RT. Our study provides the first evidence that chemotherapy may not be suitable for all patients with poor prognostic factors. If the SS is located in the trunk or pelvis and in the early stages, chemotherapy may increase mortality or morbidity. Therefore, surgery combined with RT should be considered as an optimal treatment for this subgroup. \n\nOther studies have shown that RT is associated with good prognoses in patients with high-grade sarcoma [21,22]. Adjuvant RT reportedly improves five-year localrecurrence-free survival rates [23]. Other studies have also revealed improved local control and disease-free survival with RT [24,25]. However, the effects of RT on survival gains have been controversial because RT only controls local diseases and may have limited effect on systemic metastasis. Yang et al. failed to identify significant benefits of RT in terms of the overall survival rate among extremity SS patients [26]. Canter et al. did not identify RT as a significant factor in terms of survival outcomes [27]. Based on our results, we also could not determine the average treatment effects of RT in terms of the survival of patients with SS in propensity-scorematched cases. However, there may be a subgroup that can benefit from RT in terms of survival time. Through our Bayesian subgroup analysis, we identified an optimal subgroup with a significantly enhanced CTE. Our results indicated that RT is more effective in a subgroup with characteristics of old age (age > 20 years), male, large tumors (> 5 cm), extremity locations, early stages (SEER 1), and biphasic subtypes. Although the patients in this subgroup are all in the early stages, their survival rate is significantly lower without RT. \n\nAlthough underlying biological mechanisms require additional research, our study is the first to address the treatment effects and CTEs of chemotherapy and RT in subgroups of SS.",

            "text": "Definition of the extent of malignant involvement is the foundation on which current oncology practice is based. This information defines applicable therapeutic strategies and provides a guide to the patient's prognosis. Diagnostic imaging modalities, particularly CT, are the primary techniques that are used to detect and stage cancer. As such, these modalities play a fundamental role in cancer management. Traditionally, stage groupings from I to IV have been used to divide patients into groups of decreasing suitability for treatment with curative intent and, consequently, worsening prognostic outlook. Recognising the limitations of previous diseasespecific staging systems, there has been a recent move towards standardising stage based on characteristics of the primary tumour (T), draining lymph nodes (N), and distant metastases (M) that have been determined to be of management or prognostic importance. For each tumour site category, an alphanumeric value is assigned reflecting the burden, or prognostic significance of the S54 Keynote lecture disease identified, with a higher value representing more advanced disease, or a worse prognosis. The 'T-stage' is of great relevance to the surgical oncologist, because it defines the local growth and invasion pattern of the primary lesion. Generally, the size of the lesion and its relationship to key anatomical landmarks determine the T-stage assignment. A higher T-stage is associated with larger tumours, or for those that have crossed tissue planes that would normally restrict the radial growth of tumour. For most cancers, T-stage reflects the likelihood that the primary lesion can be successfully, and safely, resected en bloc. At some stage in their evolution many malignancies develop the ability to metastasize. This can occur to regional lymph nodes via lymphatic vessels draining the primary tumour, and generally proceeds in a hierarchical manner from proximal to distal nodal sites. The extent of nodal spread is designated by the 'N-stage'. Higher nodal stage is reflective of spread to more distant nodal echelons, by larger nodal size, or both. The presence and extent of nodal involvement is critical to decisions regarding suitability for treatment with loco-regional therapies such as surgery and radiotherapy.",

            "text": "The optimal strategy for locally advanced gastric cancer is peri-operative comprehensive treatment, including perioperative chemotherapy, radiotherapy and novel molecular agents. To our knowledge, few studies have explored   to compare the long-term outcomes of preoperative with postoperative chemo-radiotherapy in gastric cancer with PSM method. The survival analysis after PSM indicated that DFS rate of pre-CRT group was significant higher than that of post-CRT. And the pre-CRT group showed a trend towards to better 3-year OS. \n\nRadiotherapy plays an important role in the comprehensive treatment of locally advanced gastric cancer. Seyedin et al. analyzed the prognosis of 21,472 patients with stage I-IV gastric cancer in SEER database. For patients with stage II, III, or IV, those treated with radiotherapy had the best outcome compared with the other treatment modalities [12]. The study based on 21,447 cases of gastric cancer from the NCDB database showed that the use of RT in addition to chemotherapy was associated with a significant OS advantage [13]. \n\nIn randomized studies of postoperative radiotherapy, although the series of ARTIST studies did not obtain positive results, INT0116 and CRITICS studies suggested that postoperative radiotherapy was effective for patients with specific treatment modality and disease stage [14,15,19,20]. Published clinical studies concerning  -3y-DFS 73% -neo-adjuvant treatment showed that preoperative CRT could improve the pCR rate and long-term outcomes [9]. The phase 3 randomized controlled study from our centre compared the prognosis of preoperative radiotherapy with that of surgery alone. The 5-and 10-year OS rates in the preoperative radiotherapy cohort were significantly better [8]. The CROSS study conducted similar results [5]. And our previous study reported the prognosis of preoperative CRT compared with that of preoperative chemotherapy. The 2-year DFS and LRFS rates of CRT group were better than preoperative chemotherapy [21]. Therefore, both the analysis based on big data and prospective randomized studies confirmed the value of radiotherapy.",

In order to minimize the complication of dual treatment, a judicious selection is necessary before planning primary radical surgery. This may be especially important for patients who have difficulties enduring surgery. We re-evaluated the current treatment methods by tumor size for patients with stage IB2 cervical cancer.

Furthermore, physicians should also counsel the patients with stage IB2 cervical cancer regarding the uncertainty of treatment options and potential adverse events related to each treatment, especially for those with tumors larger than 2.7 cm who have increased risk of adjuvant therapy after primary surgery.

            "text": "in stage II-III rectal cancer was not reported [2]. In Canada, only an average of 45% of stage II-III rectal cancers treated in 2007-2008  were reported to undergo preoperative RT or CRT in a Canadian nationwide cancer performance report [1,22]. In Asian countries, much lower percentage of stage II-III rectal cancers undergo preoperative RT or CRT, as most surgeons in Asia do not usually recommend preoperative CRT for clinical T2 or T3 rectal cancers [3]. The wide variation in indications and clinical applications of neoadjuvant RT or CRT reflect the complexity of the disease, which should alert international rectal cancer expert organizations as well as health-care administrators. Therefore, in current clinical circumstance, there are still a great number of patients with locally advanced rectal cancer receiving curative surgical treatment prior to RT or CRT. Our study will help rectal cancer patients and physicians to pursue more individualized postoperative treatment according to their risks of disease control and survival expectations.\n\nWith the wide utilization of neoadjuvant CRT in clinical practice and randomized clinical trials, several studies focused on the outcome prediction in patients with combined modality treatment. Recently, a prediction nomogram was developed to predict local recurrence, distant metastases, and survival for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer treated with longcourse chemoradiotherapy (CRT) followed by surgery in five European phase III clinical trials [16]. Postoperative ypT stage and ypN stage were most relevant to overall survival. However, as downstaged by preoperative CRT, the two most important prognostic factors (ypT and ypN classfications) could not be well applied to patients treated with curative surgery prior to adjuvant treatment. Otherwise, the decision of neoadjuvant CRT mainly relies on preoperative staging of the primary tumor. The accuracy of T and N stage by preoperative MRI or endorectal ultrasound varies, especially in N stage. A number of patients with locally advanced rectal cancer will be under-staged preoperatively and undergo surgery first. The postoperative treatment and outcome prediction for this group of patients are currently lacking. Moreover, although perioperative CRT or",

            "text": "Abstract Treatment of rectal cancer is currently guided by the need to reduce local recurrence, improve survival, reduce treatment-related toxicity, and improve the patient's quality of life (QoL). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan is now the imaging modality of choice for rectal cancer. However, the role of MRI in rectal cancer has transformed beyond describing the local stage of cancer to becoming a tool to predict the prognosis of a patient by its ability to detect features associated with a high risk of recurrence and poor survival. This greatly helps the multidisciplinary team (MDT) responsible for treating patients with rectal cancer to stratify them based on the potential for recurrence and decide on the need for and type of preoperative treatment to be offered. MRI also has the ability to assess the response to such treatments, based on which the MDT can tailor the subsequent treatment. This has the potential to spare the patient from unnecessary treatment, thus improving the QoL. MRI provides a roadmap to the surgeon while planning the surgery. In this review, we give a brief overview of the current management strategies for rectal cancer and highlight the role of MRI in the decision-making process.",

            "text": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) affects nearly 1.4 million new patients each year worldwide. 1 The treatment algorithm for local or locally advanced colon and rectal cancer (RC), and also for patients with never-resectable metastases, is well established. [2][3][4] However, the optimal strategy in patients with synchronous metastasis is more controversial and, especially in patients with RC, several modalities must be combined to achieve the most favorable outcome. Before the introduction of total mesorectal excision (TME) a local recurrence was frequently seen in 30-40% of patients with locally advanced RC. 5 Neoadjuvant long-course chemo-radiation (LC-CRT) or short-course radiotherapy (SC-RT) followed by appropriate TME has reduced local recurrence (LR) rates to 5% or even less as shown not only in randomized trial with selected patients but also in population cohorts. 6,7 However, the role and timing of neoadjuvant radiation is less well defined in patients presenting with synchronous metastasis. Randomized studies have focused on one treatment modality (e.g. preoperative LC-CRT or SC-RT in patients with resectable RC or chemotherapy in the setting of widespread nonresectable metastatic disease) but the sequence of different modalities (surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation) has not been studied in a randomized strategy trial. Based on lack of consensus regarding the optimal sequence of surgery, systemic therapy and radiotherapy for patients with stage 4 RC treated with curative intent, a 'multidisciplinary session: synchronous liver metastases in RC: which treatment first?' was organized by the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) and presented during the ESMO 2017 conference in Madrid, Spain. Three distinct lectures focused on the radiation therapy perspective, the surgical oncology perspective, and the medical oncology perspective. The present paper is a summary of those three lectures with focus on a multidisciplinary approach and with an update on recent literature.",

            "text": "Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most prevalent forms of cancer affecting women worldwide. Traditionally, the standard treatment for BC involved surgery as the primary intervention, followed by adjuvant therapies. However, advances in cancer research and treatment modalities have led to the development of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), which refers to administering systemic treatment before surgery (1)(2)(3). This approach has revolutionized the management of BC and offers several advantages, including the opportunity to assess treatment response, which has been found to correlate with survival outcomes, the potential for breast-conserving surgery (BCS), and the downstaging of advanced tumors (4)(5)(6)(7). In recent years, the concept of pathological complete response (pCR) after NAC has garnered significant attention in the field of BC treatment. The achievement of pCR has been associated with improved long-term outcomes and a higher likelihood of disease-free survival (DFS) (6,8,9). For this reason, many studies have focused on increasing the achievement of pCR (10,11). \n\nUnderstanding the factors associated with reaching pCR and its impact on long-term outcomes has become an area of significant interest in BC research. However, there is no single definition of pCR, as different working groups consider various aspects. Focusing on the surgical approach, mastectomy has historically been the preferred method for BC treatment. However, with the advent of neoadjuvant therapy and the growing evidence supporting the effectiveness of this treatment modality, BCS has become a viable option for patients who achieve pCR (12)(13)(14). In some selected cases, mastectomy remains the preferred approach (15)(16)(17). This is true when oncological radicality cannot be achieved with BCS, the disease burden is still high compared to the breast volume, or there is an extensive component of residual microcalcifications. In a few selected cases, mastectomy may also be performed based on the patient's preference. In the present article, we evaluated BC treated with neoadjuvant therapy, focusing specifically on cases where patients achieved pCR and were surgically treated with mastectomy.",

            "text": "Colorectal cancer is one of the common malignant tumours of the digestive system, with extremely high morbidity and mortality [1]. The low rate of early diagnosis and the high rate of recurrence and metastasis are still the bottlenecks that hinder the long-term survival of colorectal cancer patients. Currently, the treatment methods for colorectal cancer mainly include traditional surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and immunotherapy Table 1. However, colorectal cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease that can cause irreparable harm to patients if not treated properly. Therefore, a precise treatment plan will enable patients to receive the most appropriate treatment and avoid unnecessary over-treatment to improve their quality of life [2]. With molecular imaging and endoscopic techniques for early diagnosis and borderline precision of colorectal cancer in clinical practice, each diagnostic modality possesses unique advantages but also has many shortcomings [3,4]. According to the individual characteristics of the disease, the effective integration of various molecular imaging techniques to comprehensively obtain information on the lesion site has unparalleled advantages in accurate diagnosis [3,5]. \n\nThe luminescent biological tissue in the second near-infrared (NIR-II, 1000-1700 nm) owing to reduced photon scattering, absorption and lower tissue autofluorescence\uff0c leading to less image distortion and higher spatial resolution, and allows fluorescence imaging to show deeper penetration in biological tissues [6]. From the above advantages, NIR-II fluorescence imaging has better light penetration, lower background signal, higher safety limits, and higher Maximum Permissible Exposure (MPX). It has the advantages of easy operation, sensitivity, non-invasive, non-radioactive and so on. It can directly collect real-time dynamic biological events in vivo to achieve an accurate diagnosis and intraoperative guidance [7,8]. By combining various technologies, therapeutics promise to provide effective targeted therapy and improve treatment outcomes, showing great promise in diagnosing disease, monitoring disease progression, guiding surgery, and evaluating treatment effects [3,9,10]. \n\nThe use of NIR for accurate diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer will become the most potential new direction for the treatment of colorectal cancer.",

            "text": "If there is a high clinical suspicion of nodal involvement and EBUS/EUS yields negative results, clinicians should indicate mediastinoscopy [13]. \n\nSurgical management of NSCLC Patients with early-stage NSCLC are divided into two groups, each with unique clinical and research inquiries. For individuals in the very early stage of the disease (stage IA1-IA2), the focus revolves around determining and defining the optimal extent of resection and implementing minimally invasive methods without affecting oncological outcomes. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) has now become the standard of care, rather than open surgery. Many centres are now developing robot-assisted thoracoscopic surgical techniques. For patients with stage IB-IIB disease, there is a significantly higher risk of recurrence. In this context, even though surgery remains pivotal in treatment, there is an emphasis on combining systemic therapy, radiation and surgery safely to achieve maximum benefit through multimodal approaches. \n\nLobectomy has been considered the most effective treatment for early-stage tumours since the Lung Cancer Study Group's publication in 1995, which compared lobectomy with limited resection for stage I NSCLC [26]. However, due to advancements in staging technology and improved understanding of disease biology and subtyping, there is renewed interest in sublobar resections because of increased accuracy and availability of imaging techniques like CT and FDG-PET scans [27]. \n\nOver the past 20 years, several extensive database studies, single-institution retrospective studies and meta-analyses have illustrated the similarity in cancer treatment outcomes between sublobar resection and lobectomy for stage IA NSCLC patients [28][29][30]. Studies have highlighted the significant role of tumour size, grade, and histological subclassification when making a choice between sublobar resection and lobectomy [31,32]. However, conducting retrospective research in this area is associated with limitations due to potential influences from patient comorbidities on the decision-making process regarding the procedure of choice. In addition, there is considerable heterogeneity regarding the surgical definitions and inclusion criteria in the literature.",

            "text": "Several retrospective analyses of large amounts of contemporary data have shown the superiority of breast conservative surgery (BCS) over mastectomy carried out in the early stage of breast cancer. The characteristics of the patients and cancers that are most likely to benefit from BCS remain unclear. In our work, we analyzed the disease-free survival (DFS) of a cohort of patients treated with BCS or mastectomy between 1995 and 2018 in our institute with pT1-2, pN0, or cM0 breast cancer. The DFS curves of patients treated with both mastectomy and quadrantectomy were compared in the different subsamples with respect to the clinical and histopathological characteristics. We identified 188 eligible patients treated with BCS and 64 patients treated with mastectomy. DFS was not found to be statistically higher in patients treated with BCS compared to those treated with mastectomy, who achieved a 5-year DFS of 89.9% vs. 81.3% and a 10-year DFS of 78.9% vs. 79.3%, respectively. No significant differences were detected for the DFS curves when patients were differentiated by the type of surgical treatment received, age, and the tumor histological characteristics. We verified a p-value just above the 10% significance threshold for patients with tumor dimensions between 20 mm and 50 mm and molecular sub-type Luminal B. In our experience, treatment with mastectomy is not associated with improved DFS compared to treatment with BCS in women with early-stage tumors.",

The American Association for Thoracic Surgery (AATS) previously published an expert consensus document detailing important considerations in determining who is at high risk. The current objective was to evaluate treatment options and important factors to consider during treatment selection for these high-risk patients.\n\n\nMETHODS\nAfter systematic review of the literature, treatment options for high-risk patients with stage I NSCLC were reviewed by an AATS expert panel. Expert consensus statements and vignettes pertaining to treatment selection were then developed using discussion and a modified Delphi method.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe expert panel identified sublobar resection, stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR), and image-guided thermal ablation (IGTA) as modalities applicable in the treatment of high-risk patients with stage I NSCLC. The panel also identified lung-nodule-related factors that are important to consider in treatment selection. Using this information, the panel formulated 14 consensus statements and 5 vignettes illustrating clinical scenarios.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis article summarizes important factors to consider in treatment selection using these modalities, which are applicable in high-risk patients with stage I NSCLC. The choice of which modality (sublobar resection, SABR, or IGTA) is optimal in high-risk patients with stage I NSCLC is complex, but a surgical approach is generally favored when deemed safe. SABR and IGTA are reasonable options in select patients. SABR is more commonly used than IGTA and is likely the next-best choice. A multi-disciplinary review of patient and tumor characteristics is essential for achieving an optimal decision. The clinical treatment decision should also take patient perspectives, preferences, and quality of life into consideration.",

Increasing incidence of UTUC has been observed since the 1970\u2019s, alongside the evolution of advance imaging techniques, precision biopsy equipment, and risk stratification models. The high morbidity of radical nephroureterectomy (RNU) which is still the gold-standard treatment for high-risk UTUC, has driven the development of kidney-sparing surgery alternatives for low-risk UTUC. Now, several treatment approaches have outcomes comparable to RNU for low-risk UTUC and guidelines are recommending kidney-sparing surgery for favorable low-risk disease. The main categories of kidney-sparing surgery include segmental ureterectomy, endoscopic ablation, chemoablation, and vascular-targeted phototherapy. These treatments are highly nuanced making them difficult to compare, but for most cases of favorable low-grade disease, we recommend endoscopic laser ablation with optional adjuvant intracavitary therapy. Adverse events associated with kidney-sparing surgery include ureteral stricture, bleeding requiring transfusion, and bladder recurrence of UTUC. Limitations of kidney-sparing surgery include appropriate tissue sampling (contributing to under-grading and under-staging), higher rates of ipsilateral recurrence, and potential for grade and stage progression. Collectively, these may subsequently necessitate RNU. Here, we review the technical variations and evidence behind kidney-sparing therapies as well as their practicality in the real world.",

            "abstract": "Background: Breast-conserving surgery (BCS) has gained wide acceptance as the treatment of choice for early-stage breast cancer. One of the primary goals of BCS is to obtain tumor-free resection margins. In practice, the excision of a palpable breast carcinoma is guided by preoperative diagnostic images and the intraoperative tactile skills of the surgeon. The somewhat \u2018blind\u2019 approach of using palpation-guided surgery is known to be highly inaccurate, with studies worldwide reporting positive resection margins in up to 41% of patients. In recent years, ultrasonography has emerged as an effective guidance tool during surgery and ultrasound-guided surgery has been introduced into breast cancer surgery as a method of excising nonpalpable breast cancer. Objective: The aim of this study is comparing ultrasound-guided vs palpation-guided conservative breast surgery in obtaining tumor-free resection margins. Methods: This study was a prospective randomized controlled clinical trial where patients with early breast cancer (T1-T2) and eligible for breast conserving surgery are randomly assigned (1:1) into two arms. Arm A: included the patients who will undergo ultrasound-guided breast conserving surgery. Arm B: included the patients who will undergo the conventional palpation-guided breast conserving surgery. Results: Overall, 142 patients undergoing breast conserving surgery were enrolled: 71 were allocated to the Ultrasound-guided (US) group (Arm A) and 71 to the Palpation-guided (PG) group (Arm B). Patient and tumor characteristics were comparable between the two groups. Age, Body mass index, tumor laterality, tumor location and tumor stage were comparable in both groups and statistically insignificant. Despite that the final tumor size was comparable between both groups, IOUS significantly reduced the main specimen volume and the least negative margin width (p<0.001). The median operative time was significantly longer in the US group bey around 27 min than in the PG group and this was statistically significant in favor of the PG surgery (p<0.001). The involved resection margin rate was significantly higher in the PG group and thus the need for reoperation (p<0.001). Conclusion: IOUS is the only method allowing a true real-time visualization and continuous control of resection margins during all phases of BCS. In our single-institution study, IOUS demonstrated clear superiority over palpation-guided surgery in both oncological and surgical outcomes except for the operative time (smaller excision volume yet, with optimum resection margins). IOUs provides much better tumor localization in small breasts with dense fibroadenosis. Since all the other available localization techniques (including palpation) limit the surgeon\u2019s visual guidance during BCS, IOUS could be regarded as one of the most significant modern technological innovations in the field of breast cancer surgery, restoring sight to the breast surgeon. Our findings strongly suggests that the integration of IOUS in breast conserving surgery could be regarded as a highly beneficial surgical approach.",

The aim of our study was to evaluate the performance of photoacoustic imaging (PAI) in detecting hepatic micrometastases from melanoma at a very early stage and in aiding tumor resection by intraoperative guidance. Methods: In vivo studies were performed by following protocols approved by the Ethical Committee for Animal Research at Xiamen University. First, a mouse model of B16 melanoma metastatic to the liver (n = 10) was established to study the development of micrometastases in vivo. Next, the mice were imaged by a scalable PAI instrument, ultrasound, 9.4-T high-resolution MRI, PET/CT, and bioluminescence imaging. PAI scans acquired with optical wavelengths of 680\u2013850 nm were kept spectrally unmixed by using a linear least-squares method to differentiate various components. Differences in signal-to-background ratios among different modalities were determined with the 2-tailed paired t test. The diagnostic results were assessed with histologic examination. Excised liver samples from patients diagnosed with hepatic cancer were also examined to identify the tumor boundaries. Surgical removal of metastatic melanoma was precisely guided in vivo by the portable PAI system. Results: PAI was able to detect metastases as small as approximately 400 \u03bcm at a depth of up to 7 mm in vivo\u2014a size that is smaller than can be detected with ultrasound and MRI. The tumor-to-liver ratio for PAI at 8 d (4.2 \u00b1 0.2, n = 6) and 14 d (9.2 \u00b1 0.4, n = 5) was significantly higher than for PET/CT (1.8 \u00b1 0.1, n = 5, and 4.5 \u00b1 0.2, n = 5, respectively; P < 0.001 for both). Functional PAI revealed dynamic oxygen saturation changes during tumor growth. The limit of detection was approximately 219 cells/\u03bcL in vitro. We successfully performed intraoperative PAI-guided surgery in vivo using the portable PAI system. Conclusion: Our findings offer a rapid and effective complementary clinical imaging application to noninvasively detect micrometastases and guide intraoperative resection.",

Design We conducted a systematic review, combining search results from two electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE) and one guideline organisation website (NICE), as well as using expert consultation and manual searching. Screening and data extraction were carried out by multiple reviewers. We collected data from each guideline on the recommendations for surveillance and the use of risk-stratification. Findings were compared between cancer types and regions. Text mining was used to extract statements commenting on the evidence for surveillance. Results We identified 123 guidelines across 16 cancer types. Almost all guidelines (n=115, 93.5%) recommend routine surveillance for recurrent disease in asymptomatic patients after initial treatment. Around half (n=59, 51.3%) recommend indefinite or lifelong surveillance. The most common modality of surveillance was cross-sectional imaging. Risk-stratification of the frequency, length, and mode of surveillance was widespread, with most of the guidelines (n=92, 74.8%) recommending that surveillance be adapted based on assessment of patient risk. More than a third of the included guidelines (n=50, 39.0%) provided incomplete or vague recommendations about surveillance. For fourteen of the included cancers, we found statements in the guidelines indicating that there is no evidence that surveillance improves survival. Conclusions Although specific details of follow-up schedules vary, common challenges were identified across the 16 included cancer types. These include heterogeneity between recommendations for the same cancer type, vague or non-specific recommendation and a lack of cited evidence to support use of surveillance to improve outcomes for patients. Challenges in generating evidence in this area remain, however, increased availability to linked health records may provide a way forward for researchers.

Methods & Materials: Eligible patients for this single institution phase II trial (IRB 18-002) were aged 50 or older with unifocal stage 0 to 1 breast cancer measuring \u2264 3 cm undergoing breast conserving surgery or oncoplastic reconstruction with negative surgical margins (\u2265 2 mm margin width), ER positive, negative nodes and no lymphovascular invasion. Presurgical MRI was routinely performed. Patients were treated to 30 Gy in 5 fractions via intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) using a QOD schedule on the Varian Edge radiosurgery system. The planning target volume (PTV) was defined as the tumor cavity + 1.5 cm cropped 5 mm off skin with the mean PTV30 of 146 cc (range 43-408). Clinical follow-up included history and physical, breast imaging, and the validated Breast Cancer Treatment Outcome Scale (BCTOS) at 6 to 12 months intervals. Results: A total of 50 patients with 52 tumors were enrolled with a median age of 76 (range 51 to 89) between November 2018 and July 2022 with 23 patients (46%) undergoing oncoplastic breast surgery. Median follow-up was 37 months (range 9 to 64), the 4-year local control, regional control, distant control, and overall survival were 100%, 96%, 100%, and 94% respectively. There were 2 recurrences (1 regional nodal failure, 1 second primary triple negative breast cancer) and 3 deaths from other causes other than breast cancer occurred in this patient population. Treatment was well tolerated with 22% grade 1 to 2 acute toxicity and 4% late toxicity consisting of grade 1 pain. Physician-rated long-term cosmesis was rated as 83% excellent and 17% good. BCTOS scores at baseline were 58% excellent (91% lumpectomy, 13% oncoplastic), 42% good (9% lumpectomy, 88% oncoplastic), 0% fair to poor, and at \u22652 year follow up were 92% excellent, (100 % lumpectomy, 86% oncoplastic), 8% good (0 % lumpectomy, 14% oncoplastic), and 0% fair to poor. Conclusion: This trial demonstrated the safety and efficacy of a modernized Florence regimen in low-risk stage 0 to 1 breast cancer patients treated at a community hospital. Long-term cosmetic outcomes were excellent and oncoplastic reconstruction does not appear to be a contraindication for APBI.\n Citation Format: Rachel Radigan, Vani Gupta, Andrew T.

Label-free approaches to image-guided surgery provide an alternative by discriminating between cancerous and noncancerous tissue based on differences in spectral reflectance and autofluorescence between the tumor microenvironment and the surrounding anatomy. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art hyperspectral imaging systems capable of monitoring spectral differences across the entire surgical site utilize complex optomechanical architectures that contribute to low image resolutions, low frame rates, and co-registration error that cannot be calibrated, making these instruments impractical during demanding surgical workflows. To provide label-free surgical guidance while addressing limitations with existing systems, we have developed a single-chip snapshot hyperspectral imaging system that provides 27 spectral bands from ~450 nm to ~750 nm. By monolithically integrating a stacked photodiode image sensor with pixelated interference filters, we have produced a highly compact imaging system that achieves a resolution of 1252-by-852 pixels at a rate of 17.2 frames per second while avoiding co-registration error. The system provides a signal-to-noise ratio of ~55 dB and a dynamic range of ~62 dB, and it can enable spectral discrimination under standard broadband surgical light sources. Preclinical images of human prostate tumor implants in a murine model have been examined and presented to demonstrate that the imaging system can differentiate between cancerous and noncancerous tissue and can discriminate between distinct cancer types.",

Methods: Spanning six participating institutes from 2018 to 2023, we prospectively compiled demographic and clinical data within a network cancer registry. Age, gender, addictions, comorbidities, symptomatology, biochemical and immunohistochemistry (IHC) markers, imaging characteristics, treatment strategies and outcomes, including PFS and OS, were meticulously documented. Results: A total of 73 patients with SCLC, with a median age of 63 (44-81) years were included. 85% were males, 73% smokers (62% \u201cbidi\u201d), 29% alcoholic, 22% hypertensive, and 15% diabetic. Cough (67%), chest pain (45%), dyspnoea (40%), and hemoptysis (15%) were the commonest presentations. Median hemoglobin was 13 gm/dL and albumin 3.6 gm/dL. IHC was available for 43 patients, which revealed 83% synaptophysin, 65% chromogranin, and 11% napsin positivity. 66% presented with extensive stage disease and 45% with lymph node involvement. 42% had contralateral lung, 30% plaural effusion, 11% liver and supraclavicular node, 10% bone, and 7% adrenal metastasis. Upfront brain imaging was done for 15 patients, and 40% had brain metastasis. 94% of patients underwent chemotherapy (none immunotherapy), 28% radiotherapy, and only 6% upfront surgery. Of the patients receiving chemotherapy, 62% were given etoposide and carboplatin, 19% etoposide and cisplatin, and 19% others, including topotecan or single-agent therapy (mean three cycles). 13% had significant chemotherapy-related acute toxicity. 50% revealed progression following 1st line therapy. The median duration of follow-up was 7 (1-45) months. At the last follow-up, 68% of patients had expired, with a median OS of 5.8 (95% CI 2.9-8.6) months and median PFS 4.1 (95% CI 2-6) months. Conclusions: This multicenter study involving SCLC patients in LMICs offers crucial insights into characteristics, treatment approaches, and outcomes. Results reveal alarming poor response and survival rates. The contralateral lung and adrenals were frequent sites of metastasis. Surgical options were limited, emphasizing reliance on etoposide and platinum-based regimens, with no utilization of immunotherapy. This data informs the development of primary prevention (smoking cessation), early diagnosis, more effective treatment strategies, and the need for genomic and transcriptomic analysis to understand underlying biological disparities.",

This study aimed to analyze the clinical features, treatment modalities, and survival outcomes of thymoma patients at least 80 years old and compare these features to those of patients younger than 80 years old. Method: Data from thymoma patients in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database between 2000 and 2019 were selected. Clinical features, treatment modalities of the two age groups were compared. Survival rates were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test was used to compare survival rates between two groups. Propensity score matching was used based on whether surgery was performed. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional-hazards regression analyses were performed to identify independent prognostic factors. Results: Compared with the younger patients, the patients aged 80 years or older had a similar distribution of Masaoka-Koga tumor stage, a higher proportion of type A thymoma, and a lower recurrence rate in the early stage. In elderly patients after propensity score matching, the overall survival and cancer-specific survival were better in the surgery group with complete resection and compared with patients of different ages, elderly patients showed similar benefit from surgery as younger patients were observed.

            "text": "Introduction: Thymoma is a common mediastinal tumor, but few studies have been performed in thymoma patients 80 years or older. This study aimed to analyze the clinical features, treatment modalities, and survival outcomes of thymoma patients at least 80 years old and compare these features to those of patients younger than 80 years old. Method: Data from thymoma patients in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database between 2000 and 2019 were selected. Clinical features, treatment modalities of the two age groups were compared. Survival rates were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test was used to compare survival rates between two groups. Propensity score matching was used based on whether surgery was performed. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional-hazards regression analyses were performed to identify independent prognostic factors. Results: Compared with the younger patients, the patients aged 80 years or older had a similar distribution of Masaoka-Koga tumor stage, a higher proportion of type A thymoma, and a lower recurrence rate in the early stage. In elderly patients after propensity score matching, the overall survival and cancer-specific survival were better in the surgery group with complete resection and compared with patients of different ages, elderly patients showed similar benefit from surgery as younger patients were observed. Conclusion: In thymoma patients aged 80 years or older, surgery still plays an important role in survival outcome. Compared with younger patients, older patients have unique clinical features.",

The objective of this study was to analyze survival rates at very specific residual disease diameters to determine the optimal goal of primary cytoreduction for bulky stage IIIC EOC.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA prospectively kept database was used to identify and review the records of all pts with Stage IIIC EOC who underwent primary cytoreductive surgery at our institution between January 1989 and December 2003. To analyze a homogeneous cohort of cases, we excluded pts with stage IIIC disease based on nodal metastasis alone (without bulky abdominal tumor), fallopian tube or primary peritoneal carcinomas, and borderline tumors. Standard statistical analyses were utilized.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe study cohort included 465 pts. The median age was 60 years (range, 25-87), and the median follow-up was 38 months (range, 1-199). Univariate and multivariate analyses, which included various prognostic factors, identified amount of residual disease as a significant prognostic factor (P < 0.001). Median overall survival in relation to the 5 residual disease categories was: no gross residual, 106 months; gross < or =0.5 cm, 66 months; 0.6-1.0 cm, 48 months; 1-2 cm, 33 months; >2 cm, 34 months. Statistical comparison between the 5 residual disease categories revealed 3 distinct groups with significantly different survival rates (P < 0.01). These 3 groups were: (1) no gross residual; (2) gross < or =1 cm residual; and (3) >1 cm residual. Although the difference in survival did not reach statistical significance, within the gross < or =1 cm residual group, there was a trend toward improved survival in pts left with smaller volume, < or =0.5 cm residual compared with those with 0.6-1.0 cm residual (P = 0.06).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOur data suggest that removal of all evidence of macroscopic disease is associated with prolonged survival and should be the goal of primary cytoreductive surgery. If complete gross resection is not feasible, however, cytoreduction to as minimal residual tumor as possible should be the focus of cytoreductive efforts, as each incremental decrease in residual disease below 1 cm may be associated with an incremental improvement in overall survival."

NC was either doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide (AC) alone or AC followed by neoadjuvant/adjuvant docetaxel. Lumpectomy patients received breast radiotherapy alone; mastectomy patients received no radiotherapy. Pathologic complete response was defined as the absence of invasive tumor in the breast. Multivariate analyses were used to identify independent predictors of LRR. The primary end point was time to LRR as first event.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn 3,088 patients, 335 LRR events had occurred after 10 years of follow-up. The 10-year cumulative incidence of LRR was 12.3% for mastectomy patients (8.9% local; 3.4% regional) and 10.3% for lumpectomy plus breast radiotherapy patients (8.1% local; 2.2% regional). Independent predictors of LRR in lumpectomy patients were age, clinical nodal status (before NC), and pathologic nodal status/breast tumor response; in mastectomy patients, they were clinical tumor size (before NC), clinical nodal status (before NC), and pathologic nodal status/breast tumor response. By using these independent predictors, groups at low, intermediate, and high risk of LRR could be identified. Nomograms that incorporate these independent predictors were created.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn patients treated with NC, age, clinical tumor characteristics before NC, and pathologic nodal status/breast tumor response after NC can be used to predict risk for LRR and to optimize the use of adjuvant radiotherapy.",

CALGB 40603 (Alliance), a 2 \u00d7 2 factorial, open-label, randomized phase II trial, evaluated the impact of adding carboplatin and/or bevacizumab.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nPatients (N = 443) with stage II to III TNBC received paclitaxel 80 mg/m(2) once per week (wP) for 12 weeks, followed by doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide once every 2 weeks (ddAC) for four cycles, and were randomly assigned to concurrent carboplatin (area under curve 6) once every 3 weeks for four cycles and/or bevacizumab 10 mg/kg once every 2 weeks for nine cycles. Effects of adding these agents on pCR breast (ypT0/is), pCR breast/axilla (ypT0/isN0), treatment delivery, and toxicities were analyzed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPatients assigned to either carboplatin or bevacizumab were less likely to complete wP and ddAC without skipped doses, dose modification, or early discontinuation resulting from toxicity. Grade \u2265 3 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were more common with carboplatin, as were hypertension, infection, thromboembolic events, bleeding, and postoperative complications with bevacizumab. Employing one-sided P values, addition of either carboplatin (60% v 44%; P = .0018) or bevacizumab (59% v 48%; P = .0089) significantly increased pCR breast, whereas only carboplatin (54% v 41%; P = .0029) significantly raised pCR breast/axilla. More-than-additive interactions between the two agents could not be demonstrated.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn stage II to III TNBC, addition of either carboplatin or bevacizumab to NACT increased pCR rates, but whether this will improve relapse-free or overall survival is unknown. Given results from recently reported adjuvant trials, further investigation of bevacizumab in this setting is unlikely, but the role of carboplatin could be evaluated in definitive studies, ideally limited to biologically defined patient subsets most likely to benefit from this agent.",

Methods Between January 2001 and December 2010, 40 consecutive patients with primary LACRC or LRCRC underwent pelvic exenteration at the National Cancer Center, Republic of Korea. We retrospectively reviewed their medical records. Results The median age was 59 years and the median follow-up time was 26 months (range, 1-117 months). The overall complication and in-hospital mortality rates were 70% (28/40) and 7.5% (3/40), respectively. The complication rates were similar between patients with primary LACRC (69.6%) and those with LRCRC (70.6%). The overall recurrence rate was 50% (17/34), and was lower in patients with primary LACRC than in patients with LRCRC (33.3% vs. 76.9%, P = 0.032). The 5-year overall survival was significantly different between primary LACRC and patients with LRCRC (58.7% vs. 11.8%, P = 0.022). Multivariate analysis revealed that radicality (R0 vs. R1/R2) was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (P = 0.020). Conclusion The complication and operative mortality rates of pelvic exenteration remained high, but pelvic exenteration might provide an opportunity for long-term survival and good local control. Complete (R0) resection was the only independent prognostic factor for overall survival.",

However, robust evidence to conclude that laparoscopic surgery and open surgery have similar outcomes in rectal cancer is lacking. A trial was designed to compare 3-year rates of cancer recurrence in the pelvic or perineal area (locoregional recurrence) and survival after laparoscopic and open resection of rectal cancer.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn this international trial conducted in 30 hospitals, we randomly assigned patients with a solitary adenocarcinoma of the rectum within 15 cm of the anal verge, not invading adjacent tissues, and without distant metastases to undergo either laparoscopic or open surgery in a 2:1 ratio. The primary end point was locoregional recurrence 3 years after the index surgery. Secondary end points included disease-free and overall survival.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 1044 patients were included (699 in the laparoscopic-surgery group and 345 in the open-surgery group). At 3 years, the locoregional recurrence rate was 5.0% in the two groups (difference, 0 percentage points; 90% confidence interval [CI], -2.6 to 2.6). Disease-free survival rates were 74.8% in the laparoscopic-surgery group and 70.8% in the open-surgery group (difference, 4.0 percentage points; 95% CI, -1.9 to 9.9). Overall survival rates were 86.7% in the laparoscopic-surgery group and 83.6% in the open-surgery group (difference, 3.1 percentage points; 95% CI, -1.6 to 7.8).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nLaparoscopic surgery in patients with rectal cancer was associated with rates of locoregional recurrence and disease-free and overall survival similar to those for open surgery.

Methods Between December 2012 and March 2017, 12 consecutive patients underwent percutaneous US-guided laser ablation as radical treatment of primary inoperable unifocal BC. Results At median follow-up of 28.5 months (range 6-51), no residual disease or progression occurred; the overall success rate for complete tumor ablation was therefore 100%. No significant operative side effects were observed, with only 2 (13.3%) experiencing slight to mild pain during the procedure, and all patients complained of a mild dull aching pain in the first week after procedure. Conclusions Laser ablation promises to be a safe and feasible approach in those patients who are not eligible to the standard surgical approach. However, longer follow-up results and larger studies are strongly needed.",

Materials and Methods: The study was approved by the institutional review board and was the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliant. The prospective study was performed on seven 3DMB proven low risk prostate cancer patients. In the first phase of the procedure the patient's prostate was aligned to a position concordant with prior 3DMB using the transperineal grid and fiduciary golden marker coordinates. In the second phase ablation was performed using MR thermometry to determine the ablation endpoint and lesion coverage. Immediately after treatment dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging was done. Prostate-specific antigen testing was performed 3 and 12 months after the treatment and compared by ANOVA test. A follow up biopsy was done one year following ablation. Results: The entire procedure took less than 2 hours and all patients tolerated the procedure well. There was a significant difference in prostate-specific antigen value before and 3 months after the treatment (p = 0.005). Four out of 6 patients had positive follow up biopsy for cancer. Conclusion: This study verifies the feasibility and safety of treating low risk prostate cancer with laser therapy guided by 3.0T MR imaging based on 3DMB."

Only patients with potentially resectable tumors were included. CRM status was defined as clear or involved (microscopic tumor within 1 mm of the resection margin). Statistical analysis was done by means of univariate and multivariate analysis using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard model. One hundred ten patients were analyzed. Sixty patients underwent open transhiatal esophagectomy, and 50 patients underwent laparoscopic transhiatal esophagectomy. There were 6 (5%) T(1), 18 (16%) T(2), and 86 (89%) T(3) tumors. CRM was clear in 68 (62%) patients and involved in 42 (38%) patients. Median survival in these groups was 50 vs. 20 months (P = 0.000). Since CRM involvement was only seen in T(3) tumors, this group was analyzed in detail. Median survival in the T(3)CRM(-) and T(3)CRM(+) group was 33 vs. 19 months (P = 0.004). For T(3)N(0) tumors, median survival in CRM(-) and CRM(+) was 40 and 22 months, respectively (P = 0.036). Median survival for T(3)N(1) tumors in CRM(-) and CRM(+) was 22 and 13 months, respectively (P = 0.049).

Tumor size and LN status were significant determinants of survival following R0 resection. There were no differences in survival based on tumor size and LN in patients with R1 resection. Median survival was 17.7 months following R1 resection and was 70.9 months (P<0.001) and 22.2 months (P=0.44) in patients with tumor \u226425\u2009mm in size and \u22641 involved LN and in the remaining patients in the cohort respectively following R0 resection.CONCLUSIONS:R0 resection is associated with dramatic survival benefit over R1 resection in a subset of patients with tumor size \u226425\u2009mm and \u22641 involved LN.

However, SABR and IGTA provide reasonable alternatives for patients unable to undergo surgery, with SABR typically being the preferred non-surgical option. <Paper corpusId=\"274623114\" paperTitle=\"(Pennathur et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nImage-guided thermal ablation, first introduced in 2001 for pulmonary applications, has become an established alternative for treating metastatic disease to the lung and peripheral stage I NSCLC in medically inoperable patients. IGTA may also be appropriate for patients with interstitial lung disease who cannot tolerate radiation therapy due to high risk. The procedure causes minimal impact on lung function, with pneumothorax and reactive pleural effusion being the most common side effects, while hemorrhage is uncommon. <Paper corpusId=\"274628477\" paperTitle=\"(Lanuti et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nHowever, as a local therapy, IGTA carries a higher risk of locoregional recurrence compared to anatomic resection. Primary tumor control rates after radiofrequency ablation range from 47-90%, with local failure rates between 10-47%. Tumors larger than 3 cm demonstrate the highest local recurrence rates. <Paper corpusId=\"274628477\" paperTitle=\"(Lanuti et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nComparative outcomes between these treatment modalities have been evaluated primarily through retrospective studies and population-based registries due to the absence of completed randomized controlled trials. Registry studies comparing IGTA with SABR in propensity-score matched patients with stage I NSCLC found no significant difference in overall survival, though IGTA usage varies considerably by geographic region and is less frequent than SABR. When comparing sublobar resection with IGTA, the surgical approach demonstrated superior primary tumor control and overall survival in retrospective cohort studies. <Paper corpusId=\"274768050\" paperTitle=\"(Pennathur et al._1, 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>",

There will be an estimated 18.1 million new cancer cases (17.0 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) and 9.6 million cancer deaths (9.5 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) in 2018. In both sexes combined, lung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer (11.6% of the total cases) and the leading cause of cancer death (18.4% of the total cancer deaths), closely followed by female breast cancer (11.6%), prostate cancer (7.1%), and colorectal cancer (6.1%) for incidence and colorectal cancer (9.2%), stomach cancer (8.2%), and liver cancer (8.2%) for mortality. Lung cancer is the most frequent cancer and the leading cause of cancer death among males, followed by prostate and colorectal cancer (for incidence) and liver and stomach cancer (for mortality). Among females, breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death, followed by colorectal and lung cancer (for incidence), and vice versa (for mortality); cervical cancer ranks fourth for both incidence and mortality. The most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death, however, substantially vary across countries and within each country depending on the degree of economic development and associated social and life style factors. It is noteworthy that high\u2010quality cancer registry data, the basis for planning and implementing evidence\u2010based cancer control programs, are not available in most low\u2010 and middle\u2010income countries. The Global Initiative for Cancer Registry Development is an international partnership that supports better estimation, as well as the collection and use of local data, to prioritize and evaluate national cancer control efforts.

                            "Image-guided thermal ablation (IGTA) applied to pulmonary pathology is an alternative to surgery in high-risk patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Its application to lung neoplasm was first introduced in 2001 and has been implemented to treat metastatic disease to the lung or in select medically inoperable patients with peripheral stage I NSCLC. IGTA may also be an alternative to treat stage I NSCLC in non-operable patients with interstitial lung disease in whom a radiation modality is deemed too high risk",
                            "Because IGTA is a local therapy, a higher risk of locoregional recurrence is inherently understood as compared with anatomic resection. In the literature, primary tumor control after RFA ranges from 47-90% and is dependent on tumor size and proximity to bronchovascular structures. Local failure ranges from 10-47%, and tumors \u2265 3 cm have the highest rate of local recurrence. The most prevalent side effects are pneumothorax and reactive pleural effusion; hemorrhage is uncommon. Of note, observational series show no significant loss of lung function after IGTA."

                            "The Clinical Practice Standards Committee of the American Association for Thoracic Surgery assembled an expert panel and conducted a systematic review of the literature detailing studies directly comparing treatment options for high-risk patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A systematic search was performed to identify publications comparing outcomes following image-guided thermal ablation (IGTA), stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR), and sublobar resection-the main treatment options applicable to high-risk patients with stage I NSCLC. There were no publications detailing completed randomized controlled trials comparing these treatment options. Several retrospective studies with comparisons were identified, some of which used large, population-based registries. The findings in 18 of these studies are summarized in this Expert Review article. Registry studies comparing IGTA with SABR in propensity-score matched patients with stage I NSCLC found no difference in overall survival. The use of thermal ablation was less frequent and had wider variation depending on geographic region as compared with SABR, however. Studies yielding high-quality data comparing SABR with sublobar resection have been limited. When comparing sublobar resection with IGTA, sublobar resection was associated with superior primary tumor control and overall survival in the retrospective cohort studies."

                "text": "\nIn gynecological oncology, image-guided approaches have demonstrated substantial clinical value, particularly for epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) and cervical cancer. For EOC, complete cytoreductive surgery represents the cornerstone of treatment, with the extent of surgical debulking serving as the most significant prognostic factor for patient survival. Fluorescence image-guided surgery (FIGS) has emerged as a valuable technique that enhances intraoperative visualization and delineation of malignant lesions through fluorescently labeled biomarkers, ultimately improving surgical guidance <Paper corpusId=\"227252091\" paperTitle=\"(Kleinmanns et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe critical importance of complete debulking has been consistently confirmed in numerous clinical trials. These studies have established that achieving complete macroscopic resection significantly impacts survival outcomes and may increase the efficacy of subsequent drug therapies <Paper corpusId=\"227252091\" paperTitle=\"(Kleinmanns et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"8635826\" paperTitle=\"(Chi et al., 2007)\" isShortName></Paper>. The survival benefit of complete resection is substantial, with research showing median overall survival of 106 months for patients with no gross residual disease compared to 66 months for those with residual disease \u22640.5 cm <Paper corpusId=\"8635826\" paperTitle=\"(Chi et al., 2007)\" isShortName></Paper>. Notably, clinical evidence suggests that patients with macroscopic residual disease after surgery receive no significant benefit compared to those undergoing suboptimal debulking, highlighting the need for enhanced surgical visualization tools <Paper corpusId=\"227252091\" paperTitle=\"(Kleinmanns et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nFor cervical cancer, image-guided brachytherapy has revolutionized treatment approaches by improving local control while reducing normal tissue toxicity. The French STIC trial, a prospective non-randomized study comparing two-dimensional versus three-dimensional brachytherapy for locally advanced cervical cancer, demonstrated that three-dimensional image-guided brachytherapy was both feasible and safe in routine clinical practice. This approach resulted in improved local control with approximately half the toxicity observed with conventional two-dimensional dosimetry <Paper corpusId=\"258080438\" paperTitle=\"(Sagae et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nFurther supporting this approach, the American Brachytherapy Task Group 29 conducted a pooled analysis of clinical outcomes for high-dose-rate brachytherapy in cervical cancer. Their findings confirmed significant improvements in outcomes with image-guided brachytherapy compared to traditional point A dose prescriptions, establishing high-dose-rate brachytherapy combined with image guidance as a safe and effective treatment modality <Paper corpusId=\"258080438\" paperTitle=\"(Sagae et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. Additionally, the international RetroEMBRACE study reported improved local control and reduced late toxicity for women with large tumors treated with image-guided brachytherapy compared to historical controls <Paper corpusId=\"258080438\" paperTitle=\"(Sagae et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.",

                            "OBJECTIVE\nRecent studies have suggested that the definition of optimal cytoreduction for advanced EOC should be changed from the current Gynecologic Oncology Group threshold of < or =1 cm residual disease to no gross residual disease owing to improved survival of patients (pts) rendered macroscopically disease-free. The objective of this study was to analyze survival rates at very specific residual disease diameters to determine the optimal goal of primary cytoreduction for bulky stage IIIC EOC.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA prospectively kept database was used to identify and review the records of all pts with Stage IIIC EOC who underwent primary cytoreductive surgery at our institution between January 1989 and December 2003. To analyze a homogeneous cohort of cases, we excluded pts with stage IIIC disease based on nodal metastasis alone (without bulky abdominal tumor), fallopian tube or primary peritoneal carcinomas, and borderline tumors. Standard statistical analyses were utilized.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe study cohort included 465 pts. The median age was 60 years (range, 25-87), and the median follow-up was 38 months (range, 1-199). Univariate and multivariate analyses, which included various prognostic factors, identified amount of residual disease as a significant prognostic factor (P < 0.001). Median overall survival in relation to the 5 residual disease categories was: no gross residual, 106 months; gross < or =0.5 cm, 66 months; 0.6-1.0 cm, 48 months; 1-2 cm, 33 months; >2 cm, 34 months. Statistical comparison between the 5 residual disease categories revealed 3 distinct groups with significantly different survival rates (P < 0.01). These 3 groups were: (1) no gross residual; (2) gross < or =1 cm residual; and (3) >1 cm residual. Although the difference in survival did not reach statistical significance, within the gross < or =1 cm residual group, there was a trend toward improved survival in pts left with smaller volume, < or =0.5 cm residual compared with those with 0.6-1.0 cm residual (P = 0.06).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOur data suggest that removal of all evidence of macroscopic disease is associated with prolonged survival and should be the goal of primary cytoreductive surgery. If complete gross resection is not feasible, however, cytoreduction to as minimal residual tumor as possible should be the focus of cytoreductive efforts, as each incremental decrease in residual disease below 1 cm may be associated with an incremental improvement in overall survival."

In 2012, the French STIC trial, (Charra-Brunaud et al., 2012) the first prospective, non-randomized trial to compare twodimensional versus three-dimensional brachytherapy in treating locally advanced cervical cancer, showed that three-dimensional brachytherapy was feasible and safe in routine practice. It improved local control with half the toxicity observed with two-dimensional dosimetry. In 2017, the American Brachytherapy Task Group 29 reported a pooled analysis of clinical outcomes for high-dose-rate brachytherapy for cervical cancer, which showed an improvement in outcomes with the use of image-guided brachytherapy compared with traditional point A dose prescriptions, and demonstrated that high-dose-rate brachytherapy is a safe, effective modality when combined with image-guided brachytherapy. As reported in 2019, the international RetroEMBRACE study improved local control and reduced late toxicity for women with large tumors treated with image-guided brachytherapy relative to historical controls.

Methods Between January 2001 and December 2010, 40 consecutive patients with primary LACRC or LRCRC underwent pelvic exenteration at the National Cancer Center, Republic of Korea. We retrospectively reviewed their medical records. Results The median age was 59 years and the median follow-up time was 26 months (range, 1-117 months). The overall complication and in-hospital mortality rates were 70% (28/40) and 7.5% (3/40), respectively. The complication rates were similar between patients with primary LACRC (69.6%) and those with LRCRC (70.6%). The overall recurrence rate was 50% (17/34), and was lower in patients with primary LACRC than in patients with LRCRC (33.3% vs. 76.9%, P = 0.032). The 5-year overall survival was significantly different between primary LACRC and patients with LRCRC (58.7% vs. 11.8%, P = 0.022). Multivariate analysis revealed that radicality (R0 vs. R1/R2) was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (P = 0.020). Conclusion The complication and operative mortality rates of pelvic exenteration remained high, but pelvic exenteration might provide an opportunity for long-term survival and good local control. Complete (R0) resection was the only independent prognostic factor for overall survival."

                            "BACKGROUND\nLaparoscopic resection of colorectal cancer is widely used. However, robust evidence to conclude that laparoscopic surgery and open surgery have similar outcomes in rectal cancer is lacking. A trial was designed to compare 3-year rates of cancer recurrence in the pelvic or perineal area (locoregional recurrence) and survival after laparoscopic and open resection of rectal cancer.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn this international trial conducted in 30 hospitals, we randomly assigned patients with a solitary adenocarcinoma of the rectum within 15 cm of the anal verge, not invading adjacent tissues, and without distant metastases to undergo either laparoscopic or open surgery in a 2:1 ratio. The primary end point was locoregional recurrence 3 years after the index surgery. Secondary end points included disease-free and overall survival.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 1044 patients were included (699 in the laparoscopic-surgery group and 345 in the open-surgery group). At 3 years, the locoregional recurrence rate was 5.0% in the two groups (difference, 0 percentage points; 90% confidence interval [CI], -2.6 to 2.6). Disease-free survival rates were 74.8% in the laparoscopic-surgery group and 70.8% in the open-surgery group (difference, 4.0 percentage points; 95% CI, -1.9 to 9.9). Overall survival rates were 86.7% in the laparoscopic-surgery group and 83.6% in the open-surgery group (difference, 3.1 percentage points; 95% CI, -1.6 to 7.8).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nLaparoscopic surgery in patients with rectal cancer was associated with rates of locoregional recurrence and disease-free and overall survival similar to those for open surgery.

                            "PURPOSE\nThe limited information on predictors of locoregional recurrence (LRR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NC) has resulted in controversy about the optimal use of adjuvant radiotherapy and the timing of sentinel lymph node biopsy.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nWe examined patterns and predictors of LRR as first event in combined analysis of two National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) neoadjuvant trials. NC was either doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide (AC) alone or AC followed by neoadjuvant/adjuvant docetaxel. Lumpectomy patients received breast radiotherapy alone; mastectomy patients received no radiotherapy. Pathologic complete response was defined as the absence of invasive tumor in the breast. Multivariate analyses were used to identify independent predictors of LRR. The primary end point was time to LRR as first event.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn 3,088 patients, 335 LRR events had occurred after 10 years of follow-up. The 10-year cumulative incidence of LRR was 12.3% for mastectomy patients (8.9% local; 3.4% regional) and 10.3% for lumpectomy plus breast radiotherapy patients (8.1% local; 2.2% regional). Independent predictors of LRR in lumpectomy patients were age, clinical nodal status (before NC), and pathologic nodal status/breast tumor response; in mastectomy patients, they were clinical tumor size (before NC), clinical nodal status (before NC), and pathologic nodal status/breast tumor response. By using these independent predictors, groups at low, intermediate, and high risk of LRR could be identified. Nomograms that incorporate these independent predictors were created.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn patients treated with NC, age, clinical tumor characteristics before NC, and pathologic nodal status/breast tumor response after NC can be used to predict risk for LRR and to optimize the use of adjuvant radiotherapy."

                            "PURPOSE\nOne third of patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) achieve pathologic complete response (pCR) with standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). CALGB 40603 (Alliance), a 2 \u00d7 2 factorial, open-label, randomized phase II trial, evaluated the impact of adding carboplatin and/or bevacizumab.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nPatients (N = 443) with stage II to III TNBC received paclitaxel 80 mg/m(2) once per week (wP) for 12 weeks, followed by doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide once every 2 weeks (ddAC) for four cycles, and were randomly assigned to concurrent carboplatin (area under curve 6) once every 3 weeks for four cycles and/or bevacizumab 10 mg/kg once every 2 weeks for nine cycles. Effects of adding these agents on pCR breast (ypT0/is), pCR breast/axilla (ypT0/isN0), treatment delivery, and toxicities were analyzed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPatients assigned to either carboplatin or bevacizumab were less likely to complete wP and ddAC without skipped doses, dose modification, or early discontinuation resulting from toxicity. Grade \u2265 3 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were more common with carboplatin, as were hypertension, infection, thromboembolic events, bleeding, and postoperative complications with bevacizumab. Employing one-sided P values, addition of either carboplatin (60% v 44%; P = .0018) or bevacizumab (59% v 48%; P = .0089) significantly increased pCR breast, whereas only carboplatin (54% v 41%; P = .0029) significantly raised pCR breast/axilla. More-than-additive interactions between the two agents could not be demonstrated.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn stage II to III TNBC, addition of either carboplatin or bevacizumab to NACT increased pCR rates, but whether this will improve relapse-free or overall survival is unknown. Given results from recently reported adjuvant trials, further investigation of bevacizumab in this setting is unlikely, but the role of carboplatin could be evaluated in definitive studies, ideally limited to biologically defined patient subsets most likely to benefit from this agent."

We assessed the tolerability, with particular focus on cardiac safety, of H and P with chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant treatment of HER2-positive early breast cancer.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nIn this multicenter, open-label phase II study, patients with operable, locally advanced, or inflammatory breast cancer were randomized 1 : 1 : 1 to receive six neoadjuvant cycles q3w (Arm A: 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide [FEC] + H + P \u00d73 \u2192 docetaxel [T] + H + P \u00d73; Arm B: FEC \u00d73 \u2192 T + H + P \u00d73; Arm C: T + carboplatin + H [TCH]+P \u00d76). pCR was assessed at surgery and adjuvant therapy given to complete 1 year of H.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTwo hundred twenty-five patients were randomized. During neoadjuvant treatment, two patients (2.7%; Arm B) experienced symptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) and 11 patients (Arm A: 4 [5.6%]; Arm B: 4 [5.3%]; Arm C: 3 [3.9%]) had declines in left ventricular ejection fraction of \u226510% points from baseline to <50%. Diarrhea was the most common adverse event. pCR (ypT0/is) was reported for 61.6% (Arm A), 57.3% (Arm B), and 66.2% (Arm C) of patients.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe combination of P with H and standard chemotherapy resulted in low rates of symptomatic LVSD."

Among these options, image-guided stereotactic radiotherapy (IGSRT) has emerged as a particularly valuable non-surgical alternative for patients with early-stage NMSC. \n\nIGSRT combines advanced imaging capabilities with precisely targeted radiation delivery, allowing for accurate treatment of skin lesions while sparing surrounding healthy tissue. This approach has demonstrated local control rates comparable to those achieved with Mohs micrographic surgery, which is generally considered the gold standard surgical approach for NMSC. The comparable efficacy of IGSRT makes it a viable option for patients who are poor surgical candidates or who prefer non-invasive treatment approaches. <Paper corpusId=\"251276582\" paperTitle=\"(Yu et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nBeyond its clinical efficacy, IGSRT offers additional advantages by potentially reducing the economic, social, and psychological burden associated with recurrent disease. Lower recurrence rates translate to fewer follow-up procedures, decreased healthcare costs, and improved quality of life for patients. These benefits have led some experts to suggest that IGSRT could be considered the preferred standard for non-surgical radiotherapeutic treatment of early-stage NMSC. <Paper corpusId=\"251276582\" paperTitle=\"(Yu et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nIGSRT is particularly valuable for treating NMSCs in anatomically challenging locations, such as those near critical facial structures or in areas where tissue preservation is essential for cosmetic and functional outcomes. The precision offered by image guidance allows for treatment of these complex cases while minimizing the risk of complications that might be associated with surgical approaches in these sensitive locations. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">\n\nWhile IGSRT shows promise as a treatment modality for NMSC, patient selection remains crucial, with factors such as tumor size, depth, histological subtype, and patient comorbidities influencing treatment decisions. A multidisciplinary approach involving dermatologists, radiation oncologists, and surgical oncologists is often necessary to determine the optimal treatment strategy for individual patients. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">",

                "text": "\nFor prostate cancer patients with oligometastatic disease, image-guided approaches have emerged as valuable treatment options. The oligometastatic paradigm suggests that patients with limited metastatic burden may achieve long-term disease control, survival benefit, or potentially even cure if all sites of disease can be effectively treated. While surgery was traditionally the primary method for removing metastases, newer and less invasive modalities including stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) and image-guided ablations now offer effective alternatives. <Paper corpusId=\"232433734\" paperTitle=\"(Kovacs et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nThe efficacy of SABR for oligometastatic disease has been demonstrated in clinical trials. A phase II randomized trial evaluating SABR in patients with a small burden of oligometastatic disease (primarily 1-3 metastatic lesions) found significant improvement in progression-free survival and a trend toward overall survival benefit compared to standard palliative care. These promising results have prompted progression to phase III trials to further assess SABR's impact on survival, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness for patients with limited oligometastatic lesions. <Paper corpusId=\"232433734\" paperTitle=\"(Kovacs et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"218513452\" paperTitle=\"(Olson et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nAdvanced imaging techniques, particularly prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET/CT, have significantly enhanced the management of oligometastatic prostate cancer. PSMA PET/CT enables more precise patient selection and accurate identification of oligometastatic lesions compared to conventional imaging. This improved imaging capability has been shown to enhance the effectiveness of metastasis-directed therapy (MDT), resulting in prolonged progression-free survival compared to earlier imaging modalities such as choline PET/CT. <Paper corpusId=\"276465206\" paperTitle=\"(Drobot et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nThe integration of these advanced imaging techniques into surgical research and clinical practice is increasingly recognized as essential for optimizing patient selection and enhancing procedural precision. By more accurately identifying patients with true oligometastatic disease and precisely localizing metastatic lesions, clinicians can deliver more effective targeted treatments, potentially improving long-term outcomes for prostate cancer patients. <Paper corpusId=\"276465206\" paperTitle=\"(Drobot et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>",

                            "A recent randomized phase II trial evaluated stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) in a group of patients with a small burden of oligometastatic disease (mostly with 1\u20133 metastatic lesions), and found that SABR was associated with a significant improvement in progression-free survival and a trend to an overall survival benefit, supporting progression to phase III randomized trials. Two hundred and ninety-seven patients will be randomized in a 1:2 ratio between the control arm (consisting of standard of care [SOC] palliative-intent treatments), and the SABR arm (consisting of SOC treatment + SABR to all sites of known disease). Randomization will be stratified by two factors: histology (prostate, breast, or renal vs. all others), and disease-free interval (defined as time from diagnosis of primary tumor until first detection of the metastases being treated on this trial; divided as \u22642 vs. >\u20092\u2009years). The primary endpoint is overall survival, and secondary endpoints include progression-free survival, cost effectiveness, time to development of new metastatic lesions, quality of life (QoL), and toxicity. Translational endpoints include assessment of circulating tumor cells, cell-free DNA, and tumor tissue as prognostic and predictive markers, including assessment of immunological predictors of response and long-term survival. This study will provide an assessment of the impact of SABR on survival, QoL, and cost effectiveness to determine if long-term survival can be achieved for selected patients with 1\u20133 oligometastatic lesions.

                "tldr": "Despite significant advances in image-guided surgical approaches for cancer treatment, current techniques face limitations including reliance on single imaging modalities, resolution constraints, and the challenge of positive surgical margins. Future developments will focus on multimodal imaging integration, improved real-time visualization, and standardized protocols to optimize patient outcomes. (8 sources)",
                "text": "\nWhile image-guided surgical approaches have demonstrated considerable value across multiple cancer types, several important limitations must be addressed to optimize their clinical utility. Current clinical applications predominantly rely on single-modality imaging for guidance, which provides limited structural and functional data of affected tissues. Additionally, existing imaging technologies face constraints related to resolution, penetration depth, imaging speed, and field of view, which can impact real-time visualization of treatment outcomes. <Paper corpusId=\"263005379\" paperTitle=\"(Fan et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nOne of the most significant challenges in cancer surgery remains the occurrence of positive tumor margins, which are associated with poor prognosis, higher recurrence rates, and lower survival rates across various cancer types. The clinical impact of positive margins has been well-documented in multiple cancer types, including esophageal, pancreatic, head and neck, and oral cancers. <Paper corpusId=\"49577195\" paperTitle=\"(Blau et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"1969308\" paperTitle=\"(Scheepers et al., 2009)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"2733694\" paperTitle=\"(Tummala et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"8130315\" paperTitle=\"(Jones et al., 1996)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"8635706\" paperTitle=\"(Eldeeb et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nDespite promising results from image-guided laser ablation for tumor treatment, larger studies with longer follow-up periods are needed to establish its long-term efficacy and safety. Initial studies of this approach for breast cancer have shown a 100% complete tumor ablation rate with minimal side effects, suggesting potential as a safe and feasible approach for patients ineligible for standard surgical approaches. However, these results must be validated in larger patient cohorts. <Paper corpusId=\"263005379\" paperTitle=\"(Fan et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"49661568\" paperTitle=\"(Nori et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nFuture developments in image-guided surgery will likely focus on several key areas. First, the integration of multimodal imaging techniques could provide more comprehensive information about tumor characteristics and surrounding tissues, potentially improving surgical precision. Second, advances in real-time image processing and visualization technologies may enhance surgeons' ability to identify tumor margins intraoperatively, potentially reducing the incidence of positive margins. Third, the development of standardized protocols for different cancer types and stages could help optimize patient selection and treatment planning.\n\nAdditionally, the refinement of MR-guided laser ablation techniques for prostate cancer and other malignancies represents a promising direction. Early feasibility studies have demonstrated the technical viability of this approach, but further research is needed to determine its long-term oncological outcomes. <Paper corpusId=\"263005379\" paperTitle=\"(Fan et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"52879529\" paperTitle=\"(Barqawi et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nAs these technologies continue to evolve, interdisciplinary collaboration between surgeons, radiologists, oncologists, and biomedical engineers will be essential to address current limitations and develop more effective image-guided approaches for cancer treatment. The ultimate goal remains to maximize tumor control while minimizing morbidity, thereby improving both survival outcomes and quality of life for cancer patients. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">",

                            "We studied the influence of circumferential resection margin (CRM) involvement on survival in patients with malignancies of the distal esophagus and gastroesophageal junction. One hundred ten consecutive patients undergoing a laparoscopic or open transhiatal esophagectomy for malignancy of the distal 5 cm of the esophagus, or a Siewert I gastroesophageal junction tumor were analyzed, retrospectively. Only patients with potentially resectable tumors were included. CRM status was defined as clear or involved (microscopic tumor within 1 mm of the resection margin). Statistical analysis was done by means of univariate and multivariate analysis using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard model. One hundred ten patients were analyzed. Sixty patients underwent open transhiatal esophagectomy, and 50 patients underwent laparoscopic transhiatal esophagectomy. There were 6 (5%) T(1), 18 (16%) T(2), and 86 (89%) T(3) tumors. CRM was clear in 68 (62%) patients and involved in 42 (38%) patients. Median survival in these groups was 50 vs. 20 months (P = 0.000). Since CRM involvement was only seen in T(3) tumors, this group was analyzed in detail. Median survival in the T(3)CRM(-) and T(3)CRM(+) group was 33 vs. 19 months (P = 0.004). For T(3)N(0) tumors, median survival in CRM(-) and CRM(+) was 40 and 22 months, respectively (P = 0.036). Median survival for T(3)N(1) tumors in CRM(-) and CRM(+) was 22 and 13 months, respectively (P = 0.049). Involvement of the circumferential resection margin was found to be an independent prognostic factor on survival in our study. It predicts a poor prognosis in patients with potentially resectable malignancies of the distal 5 cm of the esophagus and Siewert I adenocarcinomas of the gastro esophageal junction."

Tumor size and LN status were significant determinants of survival following R0 resection. There were no differences in survival based on tumor size and LN in patients with R1 resection. Median survival was 17.7 months following R1 resection and was 70.9 months (P<0.001) and 22.2 months (P=0.44) in patients with tumor \u226425\u2009mm in size and \u22641 involved LN and in the remaining patients in the cohort respectively following R0 resection.CONCLUSIONS:R0 resection is associated with dramatic survival benefit over R1 resection in a subset of patients with tumor size \u226425\u2009mm and \u22641 involved LN. These findings underscore the importance of R0 resection and careful patient selection for upfront surgery in patients with PaCa."

The present study investigates 352 patients with squamous carcinoma of the head and neck treated by primary radical radiotherapy and who subsequently underwent surgical ablation for a recurrent carcinoma. A total of 303 (86%) patients had a negative resection margin and 49 (14%) had a positive resection margin. Oral carcinoma was 1.7 times more likely to be associated with a positive margin than other tumours (P = 0.0292). Actuarial calculations demonstrated that 47% of patients with negative margins and 66% of patients with positive margins developed a primary site recurrence (P = 0.0286). Neck node recurrence occurred in 10% of those patients with negative margins and 12% of patients with positive margins. Patients with positive margins had a significantly poorer survival than those with negative margins (P = 0.022). Multivariate analysis failed to confirm any independent adverse effect from a positive margin. The 5 year tumour-specific survival of patients with a positive margin was poorer by 12% than for those patients with a negative margin. The pattern of failure differed between the two groups, with patients having positive margins tending to die of local recurrence."

However, there is a population of patients who cannot undergo the standard surgical procedures due to several reasons such as age, performance status, or comorbidity. Our aim was to investigate the feasibility and safety of percutaneous US-guided laser ablation for unresectable unifocal breast cancer (BC). Methods Between December 2012 and March 2017, 12 consecutive patients underwent percutaneous US-guided laser ablation as radical treatment of primary inoperable unifocal BC. Results At median follow-up of 28.5 months (range 6-51), no residual disease or progression occurred; the overall success rate for complete tumor ablation was therefore 100%. No significant operative side effects were observed, with only 2 (13.3%) experiencing slight to mild pain during the procedure, and all patients complained of a mild dull aching pain in the first week after procedure. Conclusions Laser ablation promises to be a safe and feasible approach in those patients who are not eligible to the standard surgical approach. However, longer follow-up results and larger studies are strongly needed."

                            "Introduction: To develop and evaluate a technique of 3.0 Tesla magnetic resonance (MR) guided laser ablation based on 3-dimentional mapping biopsy (3DMB) for low risk prostate cancer. Materials and Methods: The study was approved by the institutional review board and was the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliant. The prospective study was performed on seven 3DMB proven low risk prostate cancer patients. In the first phase of the procedure the patient's prostate was aligned to a position concordant with prior 3DMB using the transperineal grid and fiduciary golden marker coordinates. In the second phase ablation was performed using MR thermometry to determine the ablation endpoint and lesion coverage. Immediately after treatment dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging was done. Prostate-specific antigen testing was performed 3 and 12 months after the treatment and compared by ANOVA test. A follow up biopsy was done one year following ablation. Results: The entire procedure took less than 2 hours and all patients tolerated the procedure well. There was a significant difference in prostate-specific antigen value before and 3 months after the treatment (p = 0.005). Four out of 6 patients had positive follow up biopsy for cancer. Conclusion: This study verifies the feasibility and safety of treating low risk prostate cancer with laser therapy guided by 3.0T MR imaging based on 3DMB."
