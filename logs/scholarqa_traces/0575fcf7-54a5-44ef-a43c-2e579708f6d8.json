The increased permeability is important in mediating the uptake of an intravenously administered drug in a solid tumor and is known as the enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) effect. Studies in animal models have demonstrated a cut-off size of 500 nm - 1 \u00b5m for molecules or nanoparticles to extravasate into a tumor, however, surprisingly little is known about the kinetics of the EPR effect. Here we present a pharmacokinetic model to quantitatively assess the influence of the EPR effect on the uptake of a drug into a solid tumor. We use pharmacokinetic data for Doxil and doxorubicin from human clinical trials to illustrate how the EPR effect influences tumor uptake. This model provides a quantitative framework to guide preclinical trials of new chemotherapies and ultimately to develop design rules that can increase targeting efficiency and decrease unwanted side effects in normal tissue.",

                    "text": "In a growing solid tumor, the combination of hypoxic environment and inflammatory response leads to the up-regulation of angiogenic factors and down-regulation of angiogenic inhibitors, promoting the formation of new vessels. This process involves local removal of smooth muscle cells and degradation of basement membrane and extracellular matrix (ECM) by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). At the same time, the proliferation of tumor cells causes expansion of the microenvironment and generates local compressive forces [1]. Expansion increases the average spacing between vessels, reducing the supply of nutrients, and creating hypoxic regions in the tumor. The compressive forces generated by tumor growth leads to contraction of blood vessels that contributes to increased resistance to flow. Compressive forces on lymphatic vessels lead to poor lymphatic drainage and increased interstitial fluid pressure. This combination of biochemical and mechanical factors leads to an irregular vascular architecture, increased resistance to blood flow, poor perfusion, and increased permeability. The leakiness of the tumor vasculature is key for systemic delivery of anticancer drugs to a solid tumor, and is known as the Enhanced Permeation and Retention (EPR) effect (Fig 1A) [2,3]. In animal models, the cut-off size for extravasation from the tumor vasculature varies from 200 nm to 1.2 \u03bcm depending on the tumor type [4][5][6]. A diameter of about 200 nm is often considered an upper limit for successful drug delivery [7,8]. \n\nDespite its critical importance in cancer therapy, surprisingly little is known about the kinetics of the EPR effect. Here we present a model for the pharmacokinetics of a chemotherapeutic drug or nanomedicine that takes into account extravasation from circulation at the tumor site by the EPR effect and intravasation back into circulation. We use data from clinical trials of Doxil and doxorubicin to quantitatively assess the influence of the EPR effect on tumor uptake.",

Ulmschneider, P. Searson\n## Abstract\nTumor vasculature is characterized by a variety of abnormalities including irregular architecture, poor lymphatic drainage, and the upregulation of factors that increase the paracellular permeability. The increased permeability is important in mediating the uptake of an intravenously administered drug in a solid tumor and is known as the enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) effect. Studies in animal models have demonstrated a cut-off size of 500 nm - 1 \u00b5m for molecules or nanoparticles to extravasate into a tumor, however, surprisingly little is known about the kinetics of the EPR effect. Here we present a pharmacokinetic model to quantitatively assess the influence of the EPR effect on the uptake of a drug into a solid tumor. We use pharmacokinetic data for Doxil and doxorubicin from human clinical trials to illustrate how the EPR effect influences tumor uptake. This model provides a quantitative framework to guide preclinical trials of new chemotherapies and ultimately to develop design rules that can increase targeting efficiency and decrease unwanted side effects in normal tissue.\n## Introduction\nIn a growing solid tumor, the combination of hypoxic environment and inflammatory response leads to the up-regulation of angiogenic factors and down-regulation of angiogenic inhibitors, promoting the formation of new vessels. This process involves local removal of smooth muscle cells and degradation of basement membrane and extracellular matrix (ECM) by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). At the same time, the proliferation of tumor cells causes expansion of the microenvironment and generates local compressive forces [1]. Expansion increases the average spacing between vessels, reducing the supply of nutrients, and creating hypoxic regions in the tumor. The compressive forces generated by tumor growth leads to contraction of blood vessels that contributes to increased resistance to flow. Compressive forces on lymphatic vessels lead to poor lymphatic drainage and increased interstitial fluid pressure. This combination of biochemical and mechanical factors leads to an irregular vascular architecture, increased resistance to blood flow, poor perfusion, and increased permeability. The leakiness of the tumor vasculature is key for systemic delivery of anticancer drugs to a solid tumor, and is known as the Enhanced Permeation and Retention (EPR) effect (Fig 1A) [2,3]. In animal models, the cut-off size for extravasation from the tumor vasculature varies from 200 nm to 1.2 \u03bcm depending on the tumor type [4][5][6]. A diameter of about 200 nm is often considered an upper limit for successful drug delivery [7,8]. \n\nDespite its critical importance in cancer therapy, surprisingly little is known about the kinetics of the EPR effect. Here we present a model for the pharmacokinetics of a chemotherapeutic drug or nanomedicine that takes into account extravasation from circulation at the tumor site by the EPR effect and intravasation back into circulation. We use data from clinical trials of Doxil and doxorubicin to quantitatively assess the influence of the EPR effect on tumor uptake.",

Nanomedicine is an emerging class of therapeutics in which a drug is packaged into a nanoparticle that promotes uptake of the drug at a tumor site, shielding it from uptake by peripheral organs and enabling the safe delivery of chemotherapeutics that have poor aqueous solubility, short plasma half-life, narrow therapeutic window, and toxic side effects. Despite the advantages of nanomedicines for cancer, there remains significant challenges to improve uptake at the tumor and prevent premature clearance from the body. In this review, we summarize the effects of first-pass metabolism on a nanoparticle\u2019s journey to a tumor and outline future steps that we believe will improve the efficacy of cancer nanomedicines. Abstract Nanomedicines represent the cutting edge of today\u2019s cancer therapeutics. Seminal research decades ago has begun to pay dividends in the clinic, allowing for the delivery of cancer drugs with enhanced systemic circulation while also minimizing off-target toxicity. Despite the advantages of delivering cancer drugs using nanoparticles, micelles, or other nanostructures, only a small fraction of the injected dose reaches the tumor, creating a narrow therapeutic window for an otherwise potent drug. First-pass metabolism of nanoparticles by the reticuloendothelial system (RES) has been identified as a major culprit for the depletion of nanoparticles in circulation before they reach the tumor site. To overcome this, new strategies, materials, and functionalization with stealth polymers have been developed to improve nanoparticle circulation and uptake at the tumor site. This review summarizes the strategies undertaken to evade RES uptake of nanomedicines and improve the passive and active targeting of nanoparticle drugs to solid tumors. We also outline the limitations of current strategies and the future directions we believe will be explored to yield significant benefits to patients and make nanomedicine a promising treatment modality for cancer.",

                    "text": "The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect is historically one of the most frequently cited advantages of nanoparticle cancer therapeutics [37]. As tumorigenesis occurs, the secretion of pro-angiogenic factors such as vascular epidermal growth factor (VEGF) induces the formation of a disordered, complex vascular network feeding tumor cells as they proliferate. High expression of VEGF in tumor tissue has been implicated in the formation of abnormal vascular wall morphology, where the endothelium lining the blood vessels contains large gaps-or \"leaky\" junctions-allowing for enhanced permeability of small particles and cells across the vascular wall. It is this enhanced permeability that is a double-edged sword for cancer: on the one hand, it is believed to enhance tumor metastasis by allowing the escape of tumor cells into the infiltrating vessels, which circulate them across the body to distant metastatic sites [38]; on the other hand, the leaky vasculature unique to the tumor microenvironment promotes the accumulation of systemically circulating nanoparticles at the tumor site, a phenomenon that should enhance the therapeutic efficacy of nanoparticle drugs against solid tumors. Despite the premise of the EPR effect to preferentially enhance the uptake of nanoparticles in tumors, the challenges we have outlined above clearly indicate there remains significant room for improving nanoparticle delivery. Uptake into tumor tissue via the EPR effect alone has been found to result in a mere 2-fold increase in accumulation of systemically injected drugs [39]. While drugs piggybacking on the EPR effect have excelled in preclinical models, they have yet to find clinical success in humans [40]. For many anti-cancer drugs, such as chemotherapeutics that are inherently toxic, systemic injection of even nanoparticle formulations must be done at very high doses to achieve significant drug accumulation via the EPR effect; this occurs, however, at the cost of off-target toxicity that limits the administered dose and therefore, the therapeutic efficacy of these drugs [39].",

Saha\n## Abstract\nSimple Summary Traditional cancer therapeutics suffer from off-target toxicity, limiting their effective dose and preventing patients\u2019 tumors from being sufficiently treated by chemotherapeutics alone. Nanomedicine is an emerging class of therapeutics in which a drug is packaged into a nanoparticle that promotes uptake of the drug at a tumor site, shielding it from uptake by peripheral organs and enabling the safe delivery of chemotherapeutics that have poor aqueous solubility, short plasma half-life, narrow therapeutic window, and toxic side effects. Despite the advantages of nanomedicines for cancer, there remains significant challenges to improve uptake at the tumor and prevent premature clearance from the body. In this review, we summarize the effects of first-pass metabolism on a nanoparticle\u2019s journey to a tumor and outline future steps that we believe will improve the efficacy of cancer nanomedicines. Abstract Nanomedicines represent the cutting edge of today\u2019s cancer therapeutics. Seminal research decades ago has begun to pay dividends in the clinic, allowing for the delivery of cancer drugs with enhanced systemic circulation while also minimizing off-target toxicity. Despite the advantages of delivering cancer drugs using nanoparticles, micelles, or other nanostructures, only a small fraction of the injected dose reaches the tumor, creating a narrow therapeutic window for an otherwise potent drug. First-pass metabolism of nanoparticles by the reticuloendothelial system (RES) has been identified as a major culprit for the depletion of nanoparticles in circulation before they reach the tumor site. To overcome this, new strategies, materials, and functionalization with stealth polymers have been developed to improve nanoparticle circulation and uptake at the tumor site. This review summarizes the strategies undertaken to evade RES uptake of nanomedicines and improve the passive and active targeting of nanoparticle drugs to solid tumors. We also outline the limitations of current strategies and the future directions we believe will be explored to yield significant benefits to patients and make nanomedicine a promising treatment modality for cancer.\n## The Never-Ending Controversy of the EPR Effect\nThe enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect is historically one of the most frequently cited advantages of nanoparticle cancer therapeutics [37]. As tumorigenesis occurs, the secretion of pro-angiogenic factors such as vascular epidermal growth factor (VEGF) induces the formation of a disordered, complex vascular network feeding tumor cells as they proliferate.

Despite the premise of the EPR effect to preferentially enhance the uptake of nanoparticles in tumors, the challenges we have outlined above clearly indicate there remains significant room for improving nanoparticle delivery. Uptake into tumor tissue via the EPR effect alone has been found to result in a mere 2-fold increase in accumulation of systemically injected drugs [39]. While drugs piggybacking on the EPR effect have excelled in preclinical models, they have yet to find clinical success in humans [40]. For many anti-cancer drugs, such as chemotherapeutics that are inherently toxic, systemic injection of even nanoparticle formulations must be done at very high doses to achieve significant drug accumulation via the EPR effect; this occurs, however, at the cost of off-target toxicity that limits the administered dose and therefore, the therapeutic efficacy of these drugs [39].",

                    "text": "Passive targeting (Figure 5) exploits the peculiar anatomical and pathological abnormalities of the tumor vasculature which promote the accumulation of polymeric nanoparticles in the perivascular tumor region by convection or passive diffusion (Bazak et al., 2014). Convection refers to the movement of large molecules across large pores. Contrarily, diffusion is defined as a process of molecular transport across the cell membrane along the concentration gradient without consumption of cellular energy and applies mostly to compounds with a low molecular weight. However, diffusion is a more important mechanism of drug accumulation in a tumor mass because convection through the interstitium is poor; the high interstitial pressure of a tumor microenvironment does not allow the convection of drugs. The excessive leakiness of tumor vasculature, characterized by large fenestrations with a mean diameter of 100-800 nm, promotes the localization of nanoparticles into the interstitial space as a consequence of the \"enhanced permeability\" effect. At the same time, inefficient drainage of the tumor tissue due to the absence or ineffectiveness of lymphatic vessels results in \"enhanced retention\" of nanoparticles. Together, these two phenomena are known as the \"Enhanced Permeability and Retention\" (EPR) effect. The EPR effect is the cornerstone in nanoparticle-mediated drug delivery in cancers, especially in solid tumors which are characterized by rapid growth, with the exception of hypovascular tumors such as prostate or pancreatic cancer (Danhier et al., 2012). The size of a nanoparticle impacts the overall manifestation of the EPR effect on nanoparticle accumulation in tumor tissue. Polymeric nanoparticles, micelles, liposomes, and dendrimers of 80-150 nm are retained in the solid tumor tissue, but smaller particles (<20-30 nm) can easily diffuse into other compartments. Therefore, small nanoparticles exhibit poor retention even when they have good permeability (Wang et al., 2010). \n\nThe anti-tumor efficacy of many clinically available nanoformulations (Doxil, Caelyx, and Abraxane) can be partially explained on the basis of the passive targeting of the EPR effect.",

Fresta, S. Bulotta, V. Awasthi, D. Cosco\n## Abstract\nAdvances in nanotechnology have favored the development of novel colloidal formulations able to modulate the pharmacological and biopharmaceutical properties of drugs. The peculiar physico-chemical and technological properties of nanomaterial-based therapeutics have allowed for several successful applications in the treatment of cancer. The size, shape, charge and patterning of nanoscale therapeutic molecules are parameters that need to be investigated and modulated in order to promote and optimize cell and tissue interaction. In this review, the use of polymeric nanoparticles as drug delivery systems of anticancer compounds, their physico-chemical properties and their ability to be efficiently localized in specific tumor tissues have been described. The nanoencapsulation of antitumor active compounds in polymeric systems is a promising approach to improve the efficacy of various tumor treatments.\n## Passive Targeting and Solid Tumors\nPassive targeting (Figure 5) exploits the peculiar anatomical and pathological abnormalities of the tumor vasculature which promote the accumulation of polymeric nanoparticles in the perivascular tumor region by convection or passive diffusion (Bazak et al., 2014). Convection refers to the movement of large molecules across large pores. Contrarily, diffusion is defined as a process of molecular transport across the cell membrane along the concentration gradient without consumption of cellular energy and applies mostly to compounds with a low molecular weight. However, diffusion is a more important mechanism of drug accumulation in a tumor mass because convection through the interstitium is poor; the high interstitial pressure of a tumor microenvironment does not allow the convection of drugs. The excessive leakiness of tumor vasculature, characterized by large fenestrations with a mean diameter of 100-800 nm, promotes the localization of nanoparticles into the interstitial space as a consequence of the \"enhanced permeability\" effect. At the same time, inefficient drainage of the tumor tissue due to the absence or ineffectiveness of lymphatic vessels results in \"enhanced retention\" of nanoparticles. Together, these two phenomena are known as the \"Enhanced Permeability and Retention\" (EPR) effect. The EPR effect is the cornerstone in nanoparticle-mediated drug delivery in cancers, especially in solid tumors which are characterized by rapid growth, with the exception of hypovascular tumors such as prostate or pancreatic cancer (Danhier et al., 2012). The size of a nanoparticle impacts the overall manifestation of the EPR effect on nanoparticle accumulation in tumor tissue. Polymeric nanoparticles, micelles, liposomes, and dendrimers of 80-150 nm are retained in the solid tumor tissue, but smaller particles (<20-30 nm) can easily diffuse into other compartments. Therefore, small nanoparticles exhibit poor retention even when they have good permeability (Wang et al., 2010). \n\nThe anti-tumor efficacy of many clinically available nanoformulations (Doxil, Caelyx, and Abraxane) can be partially explained on the basis of the passive targeting of the EPR effect.",

Nowadays, gold-based therapeutic agents are used in the therapy of multiple human diseases, ranging from degenerative to infectious diseases and, in particular, to cancer. At the basis of these performances of gold, there is the development of new gold-based nanoparticles, characterized by a promising risk/benefit ratio that favors their introduction in clinical trials. Gold nanoparticles appear as attractive elements in nanomedicine, a branch of modern clinical medicine, which combines high selectivity in targeting tumor cells and low toxicity. Thanks to these peculiar characteristics, gold nanoparticles appear as the starting point for the development of new gold-based therapeutic strategies in oncology. Here, the new gold-based therapeutic agents developed in recent years are described, with particular emphasis on the possible applications in clinical practice as anticancer agents, with the aim that their application will give rise to a new golden age in oncology and a breakthrough in the fight against cancer.\n## EPR Effect\nMatsumura and Maeda reported in 1986 that the blood vessels of the majority of solid tumors are characterized by an enhanced vascular permeability, which allows the accumulation of antitumor agents in the tumor tissue [15]. They named this the EPR effect (enhanced permeability and retention), the mechanism by which large molecules accumulate in tumors. Based on the EPR effect, pharmaceutical nanoparticles with a higher circulation time in the blood are collected in tumor tissues with enhanced vascular permeability, and this tool is commonly used for selective drug delivery into tumors through passive accumulation.

This phenomenon is known as the enhanced permeability effect. The lymphatic system is the drainage system of the body. A deficiency of the lymphatic system leads to the retention of the nanoparticles in the tumor. This retention is known as the enhanced retention effect. Both the phenomena are collectively known as the EPR effect [171]. Using this EPR effect, the concentration of anti-cancer drugs in the tumor could be increased many times compared to the healthy tissue of the body. Interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) is another barrier in the way of successful accumulation of drug-loaded nanocarriers in the solid tumor [172,173]; however, efficient modifications of nanocarriers can overcome many biological barriers, including IFP and the RES [174].",

Khalid Hossain, M. K. Basher, Msa Mia, M. T. Rahman, M. J. Uddin\n## Abstract\nNone\n## Passive targeting\nAccumulation rate of drug-loaded nanocarriers into a tumor is much higher than in normal tissue due to the leaky endothelium of the tumor vasculature. This phenomenon is known as the enhanced permeability effect. The lymphatic system is the drainage system of the body. A deficiency of the lymphatic system leads to the retention of the nanoparticles in the tumor. This retention is known as the enhanced retention effect. Both the phenomena are collectively known as the EPR effect [171]. Using this EPR effect, the concentration of anti-cancer drugs in the tumor could be increased many times compared to the healthy tissue of the body. Interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) is another barrier in the way of successful accumulation of drug-loaded nanocarriers in the solid tumor [172,173]; however, efficient modifications of nanocarriers can overcome many biological barriers, including IFP and the RES [174].",

Specific classes of EVs include apoptotic bodies, exosomes, and microvesicles, which vary in their size, origin, membrane protein expression, and interior cargo. EVs provide a mechanism for shuttling cargo between cells, which can influence cell physiology by transporting proteins, DNA, and RNA. EVs are an abundant component of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and are proposed to drive tumor growth and progression by communicating between fibroblasts, macrophages, and tumor cells in the TME. The cargo, source, and type of EV influences the pro- or anti-tumoral role of these molecules. Therefore, robust EV isolation and characterization techniques are required to ensure accurate elucidation of their association with disease. Here, we summarize different EV subclasses, methods for EV isolation and characterization, and a selection of current clinical trials studying EVs. We also review key studies exploring the role and impact of EVs in the TME, including how EVs mediate intercellular communication, drive cancer progression, and remodel the TME.",

This can occur in a few different ways including using EVs as a drug delivery system to directly target tumors or as a method of remodeling the TME. This therapeutic avenue is largely attractive due to the biological nature of EVs, conferring stable bioavailability as well as distribution in vivo, and EVs can carry a diverse range of different cargo (Kang et al., 2021). In addition to this, solid cancers can exhibit a phenomenon known as the enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR), which describes increased accumulation of nanoparticles in tumors compared to regular tissues. As EVs are a type of nanoparticle, it is plausible that they may be subject to EPR (Phillips et al., 2021). EPR is observed in various solid tumors, and is characterized by abnormal tumor vasculature, tumor permeability, and a lack of effective lymphatic drainage (Wu, 2021). The leaky tumor vasculature allows for nanoparticles to extravasate through surrounding blood vessels (Maeda et al., 2013). Together, these function to help nanoparticles persist and accumulate in tumors, allowing for retention and direct delivery to the site of interest (Wu, 2021). These characteristics make EVs an attractive therapeutic avenue that can be adapted to different treatment approaches.",

Lai, Edwin De Jesus Lopez Gonzalez, Raul Davila, Sarah C. Shuck\n## Abstract\nExtracellular vesicles (EVs) encompass a diverse set of membrane-derived particles released from cells and are found in numerous biological matrices and the extracellular space. Specific classes of EVs include apoptotic bodies, exosomes, and microvesicles, which vary in their size, origin, membrane protein expression, and interior cargo. EVs provide a mechanism for shuttling cargo between cells, which can influence cell physiology by transporting proteins, DNA, and RNA. EVs are an abundant component of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and are proposed to drive tumor growth and progression by communicating between fibroblasts, macrophages, and tumor cells in the TME. The cargo, source, and type of EV influences the pro- or anti-tumoral role of these molecules. Therefore, robust EV isolation and characterization techniques are required to ensure accurate elucidation of their association with disease. Here, we summarize different EV subclasses, methods for EV isolation and characterization, and a selection of current clinical trials studying EVs. We also review key studies exploring the role and impact of EVs in the TME, including how EVs mediate intercellular communication, drive cancer progression, and remodel the TME.\n## Exploiting EVs to target the TME\nGiven the plasticity of the TME, it is advantageous to exploit EVs as a therapeutic approach to fight cancer. This can occur in a few different ways including using EVs as a drug delivery system to directly target tumors or as a method of remodeling the TME. This therapeutic avenue is largely attractive due to the biological nature of EVs, conferring stable bioavailability as well as distribution in vivo, and EVs can carry a diverse range of different cargo (Kang et al., 2021). In addition to this, solid cancers can exhibit a phenomenon known as the enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR), which describes increased accumulation of nanoparticles in tumors compared to regular tissues. As EVs are a type of nanoparticle, it is plausible that they may be subject to EPR (Phillips et al., 2021). EPR is observed in various solid tumors, and is characterized by abnormal tumor vasculature, tumor permeability, and a lack of effective lymphatic drainage (Wu, 2021). The leaky tumor vasculature allows for nanoparticles to extravasate through surrounding blood vessels (Maeda et al., 2013). Together, these function to help nanoparticles persist and accumulate in tumors, allowing for retention and direct delivery to the site of interest (Wu, 2021). These characteristics make EVs an attractive therapeutic avenue that can be adapted to different treatment approaches.",

NPs loaded with the drug are transported in the body by two mechanisms: passive and active targeting. Passive targeting to solid tumors can be achieved through the enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR effect), as first described in the 1980s [13,14]. Pathological, pharmacological, and biochemical studies have shown that a solid tumor usually has such pathophysiological characteristics as hypervascularization, incomplete vascular architecture, and secretion of vascular permeability factors that stimulate extravasation and immaturity of lymphatic capillaries [15]. The tumor vasculature is characterized by a high proportion of proliferating endothelial cells, increased tortuosity, pericyte deficiency, and the formation of an atypical membrane. All this leads to rapid vascularization of the tumor, which is necessary to provide it with oxygen and nutrients and further proliferation. These characteristics make tumor blood vessels permeable to macromolecules. In addition, the lymphatic drainage system of the tumor functions ineffectively due to immature lymphatic capillaries; thus, nanocarriers are selectively preserved for a long period in the interstitial tissue of the tumor [15]. Numerous studies have shown that the EPR effect induces passive accumulation of macromolecules and micelles in solid tumors, enhancing the therapeutic effect while reducing side effects. It was also found that in most human tumors the effective pore size in the vasculature ranges from 200 to 600 nm in diameter, which allows passive targeting of tumors [16]. It was noted that the secretion of various factors such as nitric oxide, prostaglandins, bradykinin, and the main growth factor of fibroblasts in tumor tissues and overexpression of genes (such as vascular permeability factor or vascular endothelial growth factor) cause hyperpermeability of tumor microvessels. However, let us note that vascular permeability in the tumor changes with its progression and depends on the type of tumor and its anatomical location.",

Chvalun\n## Abstract\nModern pharmaceutics are actively developing towards the design of targeted drugs. The development of selectively acting formulations requires the creation of smart delivery systems based on carriers that would first find the target cells and enter them and then release the active substance locally. Nanoparticles of biocompatible and biodegradable polymers can be effectively used as such carriers. Flexible regulation of the molecular structure and architecture of polymers, as well as the modification of nanoparticles with vector molecules, allows one to construct carrier particles for the development of nanoformulations for active agents of various nature. This review presents the main approaches to the design of nanoformulations for targeted delivery, describes the methods for the preparation and study of nanoparticles based on hydrophobic and amphiphilic biodegradable lactide polymers, and discusses the effect of the molecular structure and preparation conditions on the characteristics of nanoparticles in detail. Some results of research in this area of the Kurchatov complex of NBI\u0421S nature-like technologies are also presented.\n## Active and Passive Targeting for Delivery to Malignant Tumor\nDelivery of anticancer drugs to the target tissue is one of the main tasks to be solved. NPs loaded with the drug are transported in the body by two mechanisms: passive and active targeting. Passive targeting to solid tumors can be achieved through the enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR effect), as first described in the 1980s [13,14]. Pathological, pharmacological, and biochemical studies have shown that a solid tumor usually has such pathophysiological characteristics as hypervascularization, incomplete vascular architecture, and secretion of vascular permeability factors that stimulate extravasation and immaturity of lymphatic capillaries [15]. The tumor vasculature is characterized by a high proportion of proliferating endothelial cells, increased tortuosity, pericyte deficiency, and the formation of an atypical membrane. All this leads to rapid vascularization of the tumor, which is necessary to provide it with oxygen and nutrients and further proliferation. These characteristics make tumor blood vessels permeable to macromolecules. In addition, the lymphatic drainage system of the tumor functions ineffectively due to immature lymphatic capillaries; thus, nanocarriers are selectively preserved for a long period in the interstitial tissue of the tumor [15]. Numerous studies have shown that the EPR effect induces passive accumulation of macromolecules and micelles in solid tumors, enhancing the therapeutic effect while reducing side effects. It was also found that in most human tumors the effective pore size in the vasculature ranges from 200 to 600 nm in diameter, which allows passive targeting of tumors [16]. It was noted that the secretion of various factors such as nitric oxide, prostaglandins, bradykinin, and the main growth factor of fibroblasts in tumor tissues and overexpression of genes (such as vascular permeability factor or vascular endothelial growth factor) cause hyperpermeability of tumor microvessels. However, let us note that vascular permeability in the tumor changes with its progression and depends on the type of tumor and its anatomical location.",

When SMANCS was administered to mice, drug accumulation in tumors was markedly increased compared with accumulation of the parental drug NCS. This momentous result led to discovery of the enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR effect) in 1986. Later, the EPR effect became known worldwide, especially in nanomedicine, and is still believed to be a universal mechanism for tumor-selective accumulation of nanomedicines. Some research groups recently characterized the EPR effect as a controversial concept and stated that it has not been fully demonstrated in clinical settings, but this erroneous belief is due to non-standard drug design and use of inappropriate tumor models in investigations. Many research groups recently provided solid evidence of the EPR effect in human cancers (e.g., renal and breast), with significant diversity and heterogeneity in various patients. In this review, we focus on the dynamics of the EPR effect and restoring tumor blood flow by using EPR effect enhancers. We also discuss new applications of EPR-based nanomedicine in boron neutron capture therapy and photodynamic therapy for solid tumors.",

The macromolecules tend to accumulate in tumor tissues much more than in normal tissues [1][2][3][4][5]. In 1986, Matsumura and Maeda found that the underlying mechanism of tumor-selective drug targeting is based on the unique characteristics of tumor blood vessels [6]. The causes of the EPR effect are (i) defective tumor blood vessels; (ii) various vascular effectors including nitric oxide (NO), bradykinin, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), carbon monoxide (CO) produced by heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and prostaglandins (e.g., prostaglandin E 2 , prostaglandin I 2 ) that facilitate extravasation; and (iii) impaired lymphatic clearance, so that macromolecular drugs remain in tumor tissues for extended periods [1,4,[7][8][9][10]. The EPR effect occurs not only in primary cancers but also in metastatic cancers including lymphatic, liver, and lung metastases and in inflamed tissues [4,[10][11][12].

Niidome, T. Sawa\n## Abstract\nIn 1979, development of the first polymer drug SMANCS [styrene-co-maleic acid (SMA) copolymer conjugated to neocarzinostatin (NCS)] by Maeda and colleagues was a breakthrough in the cancer field. When SMANCS was administered to mice, drug accumulation in tumors was markedly increased compared with accumulation of the parental drug NCS. This momentous result led to discovery of the enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR effect) in 1986. Later, the EPR effect became known worldwide, especially in nanomedicine, and is still believed to be a universal mechanism for tumor-selective accumulation of nanomedicines. Some research groups recently characterized the EPR effect as a controversial concept and stated that it has not been fully demonstrated in clinical settings, but this erroneous belief is due to non-standard drug design and use of inappropriate tumor models in investigations. Many research groups recently provided solid evidence of the EPR effect in human cancers (e.g., renal and breast), with significant diversity and heterogeneity in various patients. In this review, we focus on the dynamics of the EPR effect and restoring tumor blood flow by using EPR effect enhancers. We also discuss new applications of EPR-based nanomedicine in boron neutron capture therapy and photodynamic therapy for solid tumors.\n## Introduction\nThe enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect is a property of macromolecules larger than 40 kDa or even 800 kDa (even as large as bacteria); these macromolecules include proteins such as albumin and immunoglobulin-G (IgG), polymer conjugates, liposomes, micellar drugs, nanoparticles, and other biocompatible macromolecular compounds [1][2][3][4][5]. The macromolecules tend to accumulate in tumor tissues much more than in normal tissues [1][2][3][4][5]. In 1986, Matsumura and Maeda found that the underlying mechanism of tumor-selective drug targeting is based on the unique characteristics of tumor blood vessels [6]. The causes of the EPR effect are (i) defective tumor blood vessels; (ii) various vascular effectors including nitric oxide (NO), bradykinin, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), carbon monoxide (CO) produced by heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and prostaglandins (e.g., prostaglandin E 2 , prostaglandin I 2 ) that facilitate extravasation; and (iii) impaired lymphatic clearance, so that macromolecular drugs remain in tumor tissues for extended periods [1,4,[7][8][9][10]. The EPR effect occurs not only in primary cancers but also in metastatic cancers including lymphatic, liver, and lung metastases and in inflamed tissues [4,[10][11][12]. Different researchers throughout the world have extensively verified the EPR effect in different tumor models as well as in cancer patients [2,[13][14][15]. \n\nThe heterogeneity of tumor tissues is another important issue because the EPR effect depends on tumor blood flow: no blood flow suggests a poor EPR effect or no EPR effect at all [10,11,16,17].",

Nanoparticle-based therapeutic systems have gained immense popularity due to their ability to overcome biological barriers, effectively deliver hydrophobic therapies, and preferentially target disease sites. Currently, many formulations of nanocarriers are utilized including lipid-based, polymeric and branched polymeric, metal-based, magnetic, and mesoporous silica. Innovative strategies have been employed to exploit the multicomponent, three-dimensional constructs imparting multifunctional capabilities. Engineering such designs allows simultaneous drug delivery of chemotherapeutics and anticancer gene therapies to site-specific targets. In lung cancer, nanoparticle-based therapeutics is paving the way in the diagnosis, imaging, screening, and treatment of primary and metastatic tumors. However, translating such advances from the bench to the bedside has been severely hampered by challenges encountered in the areas of pharmacology, toxicology, immunology, large-scale manufacturing, and regulatory issues. This review summarizes current progress and challenges in nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems, citing recent examples targeted at lung cancer treatment.",

Passively targeted nanoparticles enter through leaky vasculature of the solid tumors and are retained in the tumor tissue for extended periods of time due to impaired lymphatic flow. This unique microphysiology of tumors is exploited by many FDA-approved nanoformulations such as Doxil and Abraxane. In solid tumors, such as lung cancer, the EPR effect plays an important role in determining the efficacy of the nanoparticle-based drug delivery system [72]. The presence of a highly fenestrated blood vasculature in the tumor facilitates the EPR effect allowing the enhanced entry of colloidal nanoparticles into the tumor (Figure 2). Additionally, the poor lymphatic flow in the tumor tissue adds to this effect and results in enhanced retention of nanoparticles within the tumor site. In contrast to tumor tissues, the blood vasculature in normal tissues is intact and less permeable attenuating the uptake of nanoparticles by normal tissues. Furthermore, the size, shape, and surface properties of nanoparticles are critically important for passive targeting of solid tumors. The EPR effect usually applies to particles that are less than 200 nm in size. However, particles less than 50 nm in size frequently undergo extravasation from the tumor through the fenestrations and are thus less likely to be retained in the tumor tissue for extended periods of time. Moreover, active targeting of nanoparticles is accomplished by decorating the surface of the nanoparticle with specific ligands to promote the binding and interaction with overexpressed protein receptors on cancer cell surfaces. This approach leads to preferential binding, uptake, and intracellular accumulation of the drug or gene in the targeted cells. However, the overall tumor accumulation and therapeutic effect of targeted nanoparticles may be principally controlled by the EPR effect [73]. \n\nFabrication of polymeric nanoparticles with uniform and sub-200 nm size requires critical control over each and every step in the synthesis procedure, which is always challenging.",

Munshi, R. Ramesh\n## Abstract\nThe last decade has witnessed enormous advances in the development and application of nanotechnology in cancer detection, diagnosis, and therapy culminating in the development of the nascent field of \"cancer nanomedicine.\" A nanoparticle as per the National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines is any material that is used in the formulation of a drug resulting in a final product smaller than 1 micron in size. Nanoparticle-based therapeutic systems have gained immense popularity due to their ability to overcome biological barriers, effectively deliver hydrophobic therapies, and preferentially target disease sites. Currently, many formulations of nanocarriers are utilized including lipid-based, polymeric and branched polymeric, metal-based, magnetic, and mesoporous silica. Innovative strategies have been employed to exploit the multicomponent, three-dimensional constructs imparting multifunctional capabilities. Engineering such designs allows simultaneous drug delivery of chemotherapeutics and anticancer gene therapies to site-specific targets. In lung cancer, nanoparticle-based therapeutics is paving the way in the diagnosis, imaging, screening, and treatment of primary and metastatic tumors. However, translating such advances from the bench to the bedside has been severely hampered by challenges encountered in the areas of pharmacology, toxicology, immunology, large-scale manufacturing, and regulatory issues. This review summarizes current progress and challenges in nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems, citing recent examples targeted at lung cancer treatment.\n## Challenges for Nanoparticle-Based Drug Delivery in Lung Cancer Therapy\nSuch physical characteristics are likely advantageous to the nanoparticles in exploiting the enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) effect associated with solid tumors. Passively targeted nanoparticles enter through leaky vasculature of the solid tumors and are retained in the tumor tissue for extended periods of time due to impaired lymphatic flow. This unique microphysiology of tumors is exploited by many FDA-approved nanoformulations such as Doxil and Abraxane. In solid tumors, such as lung cancer, the EPR effect plays an important role in determining the efficacy of the nanoparticle-based drug delivery system [72]. The presence of a highly fenestrated blood vasculature in the tumor facilitates the EPR effect allowing the enhanced entry of colloidal nanoparticles into the tumor (Figure 2). Additionally, the poor lymphatic flow in the tumor tissue adds to this effect and results in enhanced retention of nanoparticles within the tumor site. In contrast to tumor tissues, the blood vasculature in normal tissues is intact and less permeable attenuating the uptake of nanoparticles by normal tissues. Furthermore, the size, shape, and surface properties of nanoparticles are critically important for passive targeting of solid tumors. The EPR effect usually applies to particles that are less than 200 nm in size. However, particles less than 50 nm in size frequently undergo extravasation from the tumor through the fenestrations and are thus less likely to be retained in the tumor tissue for extended periods of time. Moreover, active targeting of nanoparticles is accomplished by decorating the surface of the nanoparticle with specific ligands to promote the binding and interaction with overexpressed protein receptors on cancer cell surfaces. This approach leads to preferential binding, uptake, and intracellular accumulation of the drug or gene in the targeted cells. However, the overall tumor accumulation and therapeutic effect of targeted nanoparticles may be principally controlled by the EPR effect [73]. \n\nFabrication of polymeric nanoparticles with uniform and sub-200 nm size requires critical control over each and every step in the synthesis procedure, which is always challenging.",

By contrast, several phytochemicals that were found to be effective in cultured cancer cells and animal studies have not shown significant efficacy in humans due to poor bioavailability and absorption, rapid clearance, resistance, and toxicity. Research to overcome these drawbacks by using phytochemical NPs remains in the early stages of clinical translation. Thus, in the current review, we discuss the progress in nanotechnology, research milestones, the molecular mechanisms of phytochemicals encapsulated in NPs, and clinical implications. Several challenges that must be overcome and future research perspectives are also described.",

                    "text": "The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect first coined by Matsumura and Maeda [16] is defined the phenomenon of macromolecules or high molecular weight drug and nanomedicine accumulation inside solid tumor models compared to healthy tissue counterparts [4]. EPR effect is usually induced by a leaky tumor vasculature by the accelerated angiogenesis and impaired lymphatic drainage by the disorganized growth of tumors [104,105]. In details, NPs with appropriate sizes can evade the tumor capillaries and be retained in the tumor tissues for days due to the lack of lymphatic drainage. Additionally, particles with high positive charges can bind non-specifically to the negatively charged luminal surface due to the presence of sulfate and carboxylate sugar moieties [106]. It is noteworthy that nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandins, and bradykinin, which act as vasodilators, can enhance the EPR effect in tumors by increasing their vascular permeability [107]. Furthermore, some nanomedicine formulations are effective in the treatment of multidrug resistance (MDR) [108]. In contrast, Jain et al. [109] claimed that elevated interstitial fluid pressure and heterogeneous blood supply limit macromolecular delivery to tumors. Furthermore, a key challenge is the promotion of the EPR effect in patients with EPR-insensitive tumor phenotypes since the EPR-insensitive phenotype is known to have smaller endothelial fenestrations, heterogeneously high or low pericyte coverage, more developed and branched vasculatures, a relatively dense ECR, and more developed immune profiles compared to EPR sensitive phenotypes [105]. Thus, the role of EPR is still in question in terms of clinical translation and different human tumor types due to their heterogeneity [105,110]. Among the three major targeted drug delivery methods, namely, passive targeting, active targeting, and physical targeting; passive targeting acts via the EPR effect, by which tumor cells preferentially absorb NPs [111].",

Sim, W. Park, B. Shim, Sung-Hoon Kim\n## Abstract\nBiocompatible nanoparticles (NPs) containing polymers, lipids (liposomes and micelles), dendrimers, ferritin, carbon nanotubes, quantum dots, ceramic, magnetic materials, and gold/silver have contributed to imaging diagnosis and targeted cancer therapy. However, only some NP drugs, including Doxil\u00ae (liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin), Abraxane\u00ae (albumin-bound paclitaxel), and Oncaspar\u00ae (PEG-Asparaginase), have emerged on the pharmaceutical market to date. By contrast, several phytochemicals that were found to be effective in cultured cancer cells and animal studies have not shown significant efficacy in humans due to poor bioavailability and absorption, rapid clearance, resistance, and toxicity. Research to overcome these drawbacks by using phytochemical NPs remains in the early stages of clinical translation. Thus, in the current review, we discuss the progress in nanotechnology, research milestones, the molecular mechanisms of phytochemicals encapsulated in NPs, and clinical implications. Several challenges that must be overcome and future research perspectives are also described.\n## The Enhanced Permeability and Retention Effect\nThe enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect first coined by Matsumura and Maeda [16] is defined the phenomenon of macromolecules or high molecular weight drug and nanomedicine accumulation inside solid tumor models compared to healthy tissue counterparts [4]. EPR effect is usually induced by a leaky tumor vasculature by the accelerated angiogenesis and impaired lymphatic drainage by the disorganized growth of tumors [104,105]. In details, NPs with appropriate sizes can evade the tumor capillaries and be retained in the tumor tissues for days due to the lack of lymphatic drainage. Additionally, particles with high positive charges can bind non-specifically to the negatively charged luminal surface due to the presence of sulfate and carboxylate sugar moieties [106]. It is noteworthy that nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandins, and bradykinin, which act as vasodilators, can enhance the EPR effect in tumors by increasing their vascular permeability [107]. Furthermore, some nanomedicine formulations are effective in the treatment of multidrug resistance (MDR) [108]. In contrast, Jain et al. [109] claimed that elevated interstitial fluid pressure and heterogeneous blood supply limit macromolecular delivery to tumors. Furthermore, a key challenge is the promotion of the EPR effect in patients with EPR-insensitive tumor phenotypes since the EPR-insensitive phenotype is known to have smaller endothelial fenestrations, heterogeneously high or low pericyte coverage, more developed and branched vasculatures, a relatively dense ECR, and more developed immune profiles compared to EPR sensitive phenotypes [105]. Thus, the role of EPR is still in question in terms of clinical translation and different human tumor types due to their heterogeneity [105,110]. Among the three major targeted drug delivery methods, namely, passive targeting, active targeting, and physical targeting; passive targeting acts via the EPR effect, by which tumor cells preferentially absorb NPs [111].",

It is also an essential concept for designing anticancer drugs that can be selectively delivered into tumor tissue via the unique extravasation and retention mechanism for macromolecular drugs. As tumor vasculature is highly heterogeneous, the intensities of the EPR effect vary according to the types and locations of solid tumors in different species. However, the EPR effect is universally observed in a broad spectrum of solid tumors in human cancer as well as experimental animal tumor models. The matter is how to utilize the EPR effect for drug design and clinical application. Many hypotheses were proposed and tested to enhance the EPR effect in solid tumors in order to increase the efficacy of drug delivery. However, we should focus on increasing the blood flow in tumors so that more drugs can be perfused and accumulated inside tumor tissue and execute anticancer activities. Angiotensin II co-administration and the approach of intratumor arterial infusion should be considered to achieve selective tumor tissue perfusion for nanodrugs.\n",

Chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery are the conventional treatments, which have increased the survival for cancer patients. However, the complexity of this disease together with the persistent problems due to tumor progression and recurrence, drug resistance, or side effects of therapy make it necessary to explore new strategies that address the challenges to obtain a positive response. One important point is that tumor cells can interact with the microenvironment, promoting proliferation, dissemination, and immune evasion. Therefore, immunotherapy has emerged as a novel therapy based on the modulation of the immune system for combating cancer, as reflected in the promising results both in preclinical studies and clinical trials obtained. In order to enhance the immune response, the combination of immunotherapy with nanoparticles has been conducted, improving the access of immune cells to the tumor, antigen presentation, as well as the induction of persistent immune responses. Therefore, nanomedicine holds an enormous potential to enhance the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. Here, we review the most recent advances in specific molecular and cellular immunotherapy and in nano-immunotherapy against cancer in the light of the latest published preclinical studies and clinical trials.",

The main mechanism of tumor targeting of anticancer nanomedicines is based on the Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) effect, first described by Matsumura and Maeda in 1986 [112] as a passive yet powerful targeting strategy. They showed that tumor tissues had defective blood vessels with aberrant branching and large openings between endothelial cells of around 400 nm due to their rapid proliferation and decreased number of pericytes. This unique characteristic helps macromolecules, such as nanocarriers, easily move into tumor tissues after crossing the endothelium barrier. Furthermore, solid tumors have a poor lymphatic drainage system, leading to extended retention times of nanocarriers in the tumor extracellular matrix. \n\nAlthough the EPR effect has allowed the successful development of some anticancer nanomedicines with a passive tumor-targeting mechanism [99], many well-designed drug delivery systems fail when tested in patients. Over the last years, the role of the EPR effect has been investigated, focusing on the influence of the TME, heterogeneity of human tumors, and differences between animal models and actual patients [104,113,114]. These factors may contribute to the observed limited penetration of nanomedicines in human tumors, highlighting the need for further refinement of passive targeting strategies.",

Chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery are the conventional treatments, which have increased the survival for cancer patients. However, the complexity of this disease together with the persistent problems due to tumor progression and recurrence, drug resistance, or side effects of therapy make it necessary to explore new strategies that address the challenges to obtain a positive response. One important point is that tumor cells can interact with the microenvironment, promoting proliferation, dissemination, and immune evasion. Therefore, immunotherapy has emerged as a novel therapy based on the modulation of the immune system for combating cancer, as reflected in the promising results both in preclinical studies and clinical trials obtained. In order to enhance the immune response, the combination of immunotherapy with nanoparticles has been conducted, improving the access of immune cells to the tumor, antigen presentation, as well as the induction of persistent immune responses. Therefore, nanomedicine holds an enormous potential to enhance the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. Here, we review the most recent advances in specific molecular and cellular immunotherapy and in nano-immunotherapy against cancer in the light of the latest published preclinical studies and clinical trials.\n## Passive Targeting for Cancer Treatment\nDrug targeting strives for selective and effective localization of the active drug at the specific target organ, tissue, or cell where a specific pharmacological impact is required while restricting its access to untargeted normal cells, thus minimizing toxic effects. The main mechanism of tumor targeting of anticancer nanomedicines is based on the Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) effect, first described by Matsumura and Maeda in 1986 [112] as a passive yet powerful targeting strategy. They showed that tumor tissues had defective blood vessels with aberrant branching and large openings between endothelial cells of around 400 nm due to their rapid proliferation and decreased number of pericytes. This unique characteristic helps macromolecules, such as nanocarriers, easily move into tumor tissues after crossing the endothelium barrier. Furthermore, solid tumors have a poor lymphatic drainage system, leading to extended retention times of nanocarriers in the tumor extracellular matrix. \n\nAlthough the EPR effect has allowed the successful development of some anticancer nanomedicines with a passive tumor-targeting mechanism [99], many well-designed drug delivery systems fail when tested in patients. Over the last years, the role of the EPR effect has been investigated, focusing on the influence of the TME, heterogeneity of human tumors, and differences between animal models and actual patients [104,113,114]. These factors may contribute to the observed limited penetration of nanomedicines in human tumors, highlighting the need for further refinement of passive targeting strategies.",

Most therapeutic compounds cannot attain the brain because of the blood-brain barrier and its expression of efflux transporters. Among them, the P-glycoprotein plays a significant role leading to failure of various clinical treatments. A non-invasive strategy to circumvent the blood-brain barrier and P-glycoprotein emphasizes on the encapsulation and therefore masking of therapeutic compounds in drug delivery systems. Up to now, liposomes are the most widely studied drug delivery systems due to their biocompatibility, biodegradability, and less toxicity. The incorporation of polyethylene glycol-lipid derivatives within the bilayer of conventional liposomes significantly prolongs liposomal cargo half-life by steric stabilization. Interestingly, an increased brain accumulation of liposomal cargo is achieved by coupling targeting moieties on liposomes surface. These targeting moieties such as peptides or monoclonal antibodies recognize the biochemical transport systems at the blood-brain barrier and mediate the transport of liposomes and their cargo across this barrier. Moreover, stimuli-sensitive liposomes are programmed for cargo release when exposed to a particular microenvironment. Hence, this chapter highlights the potential liposomal applications for delivery of therapeutic compounds as well as diagnostic tools or both, in major central nervous system diseases.",

Such high accumulation usually last more than 24 hours [45]. This phenomenon was attributed to the hypervasculature and enhanced vascular permeability in solid tumors, which is due to the overproduction of vascular mediators including bradykinin, nitric oxide (NO), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and carbon monoxide (CO) [46]. Moreover, solid tumors have defective blood vessels with large gaps, up to 1.0 \u03bcm between endothelial cells, whereby macromolecules pass to the tumor [14]. Since solid tumors lack adequate lymphatic drainage, there is therefore a poor circulatory recovery of the extravasated macromolecules, resulting in their accumulation in the tumor microenvironment for long periods [14]. This phenomenon was not observed in healthy blood vessels [45]; hence, it constituted a promising strategy to treat selectively cancer solid tumors using nanocarriers like polymer-coated liposomes [47]. Prolonged blood circulation may allow a longer interaction time between liposomes and the target. The incorporation of soluble, hydrophilic, flexible and biocompatible polymers such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) or its derivatives within the bilayer of conventional liposomes leads to the formation of a protective and hydrophilic layer on their surface. This prevents the recognition of liposomes by opsonins and reduces their clearance by the reticuloendothelial system (RES) and consequently extends the liposomal half-life [48].

Montesinos\n## Abstract\nCentral nervous system diseases represent a huge world of burden of human suffering with negative economic results. Most therapeutic compounds cannot attain the brain because of the blood-brain barrier and its expression of efflux transporters. Among them, the P-glycoprotein plays a significant role leading to failure of various clinical treatments. A non-invasive strategy to circumvent the blood-brain barrier and P-glycoprotein emphasizes on the encapsulation and therefore masking of therapeutic compounds in drug delivery systems. Up to now, liposomes are the most widely studied drug delivery systems due to their biocompatibility, biodegradability, and less toxicity. The incorporation of polyethylene glycol-lipid derivatives within the bilayer of conventional liposomes significantly prolongs liposomal cargo half-life by steric stabilization. Interestingly, an increased brain accumulation of liposomal cargo is achieved by coupling targeting moieties on liposomes surface. These targeting moieties such as peptides or monoclonal antibodies recognize the biochemical transport systems at the blood-brain barrier and mediate the transport of liposomes and their cargo across this barrier. Moreover, stimuli-sensitive liposomes are programmed for cargo release when exposed to a particular microenvironment. Hence, this chapter highlights the potential liposomal applications for delivery of therapeutic compounds as well as diagnostic tools or both, in major central nervous system diseases.\n## Passive targeting strategy\nPassive targeting is mainly based on the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. \n\nIn 1986, Maeda and co-workers named EPR effect to the mechanism in which macromolecules with a high molecular weight, 15000 to 70000 daltons, such as polymers and proteins precipitate and accumulate effectively in tumor tissues [45]. Such high accumulation usually last more than 24 hours [45]. This phenomenon was attributed to the hypervasculature and enhanced vascular permeability in solid tumors, which is due to the overproduction of vascular mediators including bradykinin, nitric oxide (NO), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and carbon monoxide (CO) [46]. Moreover, solid tumors have defective blood vessels with large gaps, up to 1.0 \u03bcm between endothelial cells, whereby macromolecules pass to the tumor [14]. Since solid tumors lack adequate lymphatic drainage, there is therefore a poor circulatory recovery of the extravasated macromolecules, resulting in their accumulation in the tumor microenvironment for long periods [14]. This phenomenon was not observed in healthy blood vessels [45]; hence, it constituted a promising strategy to treat selectively cancer solid tumors using nanocarriers like polymer-coated liposomes [47]. Prolonged blood circulation may allow a longer interaction time between liposomes and the target. The incorporation of soluble, hydrophilic, flexible and biocompatible polymers such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) or its derivatives within the bilayer of conventional liposomes leads to the formation of a protective and hydrophilic layer on their surface. This prevents the recognition of liposomes by opsonins and reduces their clearance by the reticuloendothelial system (RES) and consequently extends the liposomal half-life [48]. Other prominent synthetic polymers with stealth properties are poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) and poly(acryl amide) (PAA) [11]. \n\nLiposomes size is another parameter with high impact on the passive targeting through the EPR effect.",

                    "text": "The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect is responsible for the passive accumulation of nanomedicines into tumor tissue [12]. The effect is a result of the rapid and abnormal growth of tumor blood vessels, which leads to increased fenestrations between cells and poor lymphatic drainage. These circumstances enable nanomedicines to extravasate from the blood pool into the tumor tissue and being retained there (Fig. 1B) [13e15].\n\nOverall, prolonging circulation time in the blood increases the likelihood of tumor accumulation via the EPR effect, simply because more nanomedicines pass through the leaky tumor vasculature over time.\n\nTumor accumulation via EPR is, among other things, dependent on the physicochemical characteristics of the nanomedicine itself. In particular the size, surface properties, shape and charge can alter accumulation [5,16]. Besides matching the gap sizes of the leaky tumor vessels, the dimensions of the nanomedicine should also be such that early clearance from the blood is avoided [17,18]. To prevent renal excretion, nanomedicines should typically be larger than~6 nm. On the other hand, nanomedicines larger tha\u00f1 200 nm are rapidly recognized and sequestered by the reticuloendothelial system (RES) (mainly consisting of the liver and the spleen). Furthermore, the surface of the nanomedicine has also an influence on RES recognition. Neutrally charged nanomedicines tend to be better shielded from recognition and therefore have longer circulation times. A common strategy to prevent RES recognition of nanomedicines is shielding them from RESfacilitating proteins (opsonins) by decorating the surface with neutralizing molecules such as poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) [17].\n\nThe tumor microenvironment can also affect the accumulation of passively targeting nanomedicines [8,19]. For example, the vascular density is commonly unevenly distributed throughout solid tumors with the highest abundance in the periphery at the host interface and lowest in hypoxic and adjacent necrotic regions. Abnormal vessel structure causes irregular blood flow within tumors and impaired lymphatic drainage can lead to high interstitial pressure gradients in the tumor microenvir",

These circumstances enable nanomedicines to extravasate from the blood pool into the tumor tissue and being retained there (Fig. 1B) [13e15].\n\nOverall, prolonging circulation time in the blood increases the likelihood of tumor accumulation via the EPR effect, simply because more nanomedicines pass through the leaky tumor vasculature over time.\n\nTumor accumulation via EPR is, among other things, dependent on the physicochemical characteristics of the nanomedicine itself. In particular the size, surface properties, shape and charge can alter accumulation [5,16]. Besides matching the gap sizes of the leaky tumor vessels, the dimensions of the nanomedicine should also be such that early clearance from the blood is avoided [17,18]. To prevent renal excretion, nanomedicines should typically be larger than~6 nm. On the other hand, nanomedicines larger tha\u00f1 200 nm are rapidly recognized and sequestered by the reticuloendothelial system (RES) (mainly consisting of the liver and the spleen). Furthermore, the surface of the nanomedicine has also an influence on RES recognition. Neutrally charged nanomedicines tend to be better shielded from recognition and therefore have longer circulation times. A common strategy to prevent RES recognition of nanomedicines is shielding them from RESfacilitating proteins (opsonins) by decorating the surface with neutralizing molecules such as poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) [17].\n\nThe tumor microenvironment can also affect the accumulation of passively targeting nanomedicines [8,19]. For example, the vascular density is commonly unevenly distributed throughout solid tumors with the highest abundance in the periphery at the host interface and lowest in hypoxic and adjacent necrotic regions. Abnormal vessel structure causes irregular blood flow within tumors and impaired lymphatic drainage can lead to high interstitial pressure gradients in the tumor microenvir",

This paper provides an in-depth review of the current advancements in the application of nanoparticles as vehicles for targeted drug delivery in CRC therapy. It covers a variety of nanoparticle types, including liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, dendrimers, and mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs), with a focus on their design, functionalization, and mechanisms of action. This review also examines the challenges associated with the clinical translation of these technologies and explores future directions, emphasizing the potential of nanoparticle-based systems to revolutionize CRC treatment.",

                    "text": "Passive targeting is another important strategy that exploits the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, a phenomenon whereby nanoparticles preferentially accumulate in tumor tissues due to the leaky vasculature and poor lymphatic drainage that are characteristic of solid tumors. Although passive targeting does not involve specific ligand-receptor interactions, it allows for the preferential concentration of nanoparticles in the tumor microenvironment, thereby increasing the local concentration of the drug and enhancing its efficacy. \n\nWhile passive targeting is inherently less selective than active targeting, it plays a crucial role in delivering nanoparticles to solid tumors, including CRC. The EPR effect is particularly effective for larger nanoparticles, such as liposomes and polymeric nanoparticles, which can accumulate in tumor tissues more readily than smaller particles. However, the effectiveness of the EPR effect can vary significantly between patients and tumor types, leading to variability in therapeutic outcomes. For example, tumors with dense stromal tissue or poor vasculature may exhibit a reduced EPR effect, limiting the accumulation of nanoparticles. \n\nTo address these limitations, combining passive and active targeting strategies has been proposed as a synergistic approach that can enhance the specificity and efficacy of nanoparticlebased drug delivery systems. For instance, nanoparticles that initially accumulate in the tumor via the EPR effect can be further targeted to specific cancer cells using surface ligands, thus providing a dual-targeting approach that maximizes drug delivery and minimizes off-target effects. This dual-targeting strategy has been shown to improve therapeutic outcomes in preclinical models of CRC by ensuring that the drug is delivered directly to the tumor cells, even in heterogeneous tumor environments. \n\nOverall, the integration of active and passive targeting strategies represents a promising approach for improving the precision and effectiveness of nanoparticle-based therapies for CRC. As research continues to advance, the development of more sophisticated targeting mechanisms will likely lead to even greater improvements in the treatment of this challenging disease.",

Burton\n## Abstract\nColorectal cancer (CRC) continues to be a significant global health burden, prompting the need for more effective and targeted therapeutic strategies. Nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems have emerged as a promising approach to address the limitations of conventional chemotherapy, offering enhanced specificity, reduced systemic toxicity, and improved therapeutic outcomes. This paper provides an in-depth review of the current advancements in the application of nanoparticles as vehicles for targeted drug delivery in CRC therapy. It covers a variety of nanoparticle types, including liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, dendrimers, and mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs), with a focus on their design, functionalization, and mechanisms of action. This review also examines the challenges associated with the clinical translation of these technologies and explores future directions, emphasizing the potential of nanoparticle-based systems to revolutionize CRC treatment.\n## Passive Targeting\nPassive targeting is another important strategy that exploits the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, a phenomenon whereby nanoparticles preferentially accumulate in tumor tissues due to the leaky vasculature and poor lymphatic drainage that are characteristic of solid tumors. Although passive targeting does not involve specific ligand-receptor interactions, it allows for the preferential concentration of nanoparticles in the tumor microenvironment, thereby increasing the local concentration of the drug and enhancing its efficacy. \n\nWhile passive targeting is inherently less selective than active targeting, it plays a crucial role in delivering nanoparticles to solid tumors, including CRC. The EPR effect is particularly effective for larger nanoparticles, such as liposomes and polymeric nanoparticles, which can accumulate in tumor tissues more readily than smaller particles. However, the effectiveness of the EPR effect can vary significantly between patients and tumor types, leading to variability in therapeutic outcomes. For example, tumors with dense stromal tissue or poor vasculature may exhibit a reduced EPR effect, limiting the accumulation of nanoparticles. \n\nTo address these limitations, combining passive and active targeting strategies has been proposed as a synergistic approach that can enhance the specificity and efficacy of nanoparticlebased drug delivery systems. For instance, nanoparticles that initially accumulate in the tumor via the EPR effect can be further targeted to specific cancer cells using surface ligands, thus providing a dual-targeting approach that maximizes drug delivery and minimizes off-target effects. This dual-targeting strategy has been shown to improve therapeutic outcomes in preclinical models of CRC by ensuring that the drug is delivered directly to the tumor cells, even in heterogeneous tumor environments. \n\nOverall, the integration of active and passive targeting strategies represents a promising approach for improving the precision and effectiveness of nanoparticle-based therapies for CRC. As research continues to advance, the development of more sophisticated targeting mechanisms will likely lead to even greater improvements in the treatment of this challenging disease.",

Despite the discovery and synthesis of hundreds of thousands of anticancer compounds targeting various crucial units in cancer cell proliferation and metabolism, the fundamental problem is the lack of targeting delivery of these compounds selectively into solid tumor tissue to maintain an effective concentration level for a certain length of time for drug-tumor interaction to execute anticancer activities. The enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR effect) describes a universal pathophysiological phenomenon and mechanism in which macromolecular compounds such as albumin and other polymer-conjugated drugs beyond certain sizes (above 40 kDa) can progressively accumulate in the tumor vascularized area and thus achieve targeting delivery and retention of anticancer compounds into solid tumor tissue. Targeting therapy via the EPR effect in clinical practice is not always successful since the strength of the EPR effect varies depending on the type and location of tumors, status of blood perfusion in tumors, and the physical-chemical properties of macromolecular anticancer agents.

                    "text": "While this may appear to be low, nanomedicines have demonstrated substantially higher delivery efficiencies than most conventional chemotherapeutic formulations in relative terms [7,8]. It has been reported that the dense extracellular matrix, high interstitial fluid pressure, and non-uniform blood perfusion limit nanoparticle accumulation in solid tumors [7,9]. The preferential accumulation of drug-loaded nanoparticles in neoplastic tissues is referred to as passive targeting [9,10]. Passive targeting is facilitated by the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect [11], i.e., the mechanism by which high molecular weight drug carriers accumulate in the tumor microenvironment (TME) due to increased vascular permeability and the nanometer size of nanoparticles [12]. The TME also possesses impaired lymphatic drainage that prevents the efficient removal of these macromolecules or nanoparticles, thus enhancing their retention within neoplastic tissues [13][14][15]. \n\nThe concept of EPR originated from a landmark study in 1986 by Matsumura and Maeda on the mechanisms of the tumoritropic accumulation of proteins and chemotherapeutic agents [16]. In this study, an increase in the accumulation and uptake of a derivatized styrene-maleic acid polymer loaded with neocarzinostatin (SMANCS) was observed in tumor cells relative to the native neocarzinostatin. SMANCS has a molecular size of 16 kDa and can bind serum albumin (67 kDa) to become a larger molecule [17]. The superior accumulation of SMANCS in tumor tissues offered prolonged duration of action and increased therapeutic efficacy. The authors opined that EPR is made possible by an increased vascular permeability, a dysfunctional lymphatic drainage system, and the relative size of nanoparticles. They showed that very small molecules will traverse biological barriers easily, while larger molecules like nanoparticles may be filtered through highly vascularized and permeable barriers.",

Fisusi, S. Adesina\n## Abstract\nPassive targeting is the foremost mechanism by which nanocarriers and drug-bearing macromolecules deliver their payload selectively to solid tumors. An important driver of passive targeting is the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, which is the cornerstone of most carrier-based tumor-targeted drug delivery efforts. Despite the huge number of publications showcasing successes in preclinical animal models, translation to the clinic has been poor, with only a few nano-based drugs currently being used for the treatment of cancers. Several barriers and factors have been adduced for the low delivery efficiency to solid tumors and poor clinical translation, including the characteristics of the nanocarriers and macromolecules, vascular and physiological barriers, the heterogeneity of tumor blood supply which affects the homogenous distribution of nanocarriers within tumors, and the transport and penetration depth of macromolecules and nanoparticles in the tumor matrix. To address the challenges associated with poor tumor targeting and therapeutic efficacy in humans, the identified barriers that affect the efficiency of the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect for macromolecular therapeutics and nanoparticle delivery systems need to be overcome. In this review, approaches to facilitate improved EPR delivery outcomes and the clinical translation of novel macromolecular therapeutics and nanoparticle drug delivery systems are discussed.\n## Introduction\nWhile this may appear to be low, nanomedicines have demonstrated substantially higher delivery efficiencies than most conventional chemotherapeutic formulations in relative terms [7,8]. It has been reported that the dense extracellular matrix, high interstitial fluid pressure, and non-uniform blood perfusion limit nanoparticle accumulation in solid tumors [7,9]. The preferential accumulation of drug-loaded nanoparticles in neoplastic tissues is referred to as passive targeting [9,10]. Passive targeting is facilitated by the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect [11], i.e., the mechanism by which high molecular weight drug carriers accumulate in the tumor microenvironment (TME) due to increased vascular permeability and the nanometer size of nanoparticles [12]. The TME also possesses impaired lymphatic drainage that prevents the efficient removal of these macromolecules or nanoparticles, thus enhancing their retention within neoplastic tissues [13][14][15]. \n\nThe concept of EPR originated from a landmark study in 1986 by Matsumura and Maeda on the mechanisms of the tumoritropic accumulation of proteins and chemotherapeutic agents [16]. In this study, an increase in the accumulation and uptake of a derivatized styrene-maleic acid polymer loaded with neocarzinostatin (SMANCS) was observed in tumor cells relative to the native neocarzinostatin. SMANCS has a molecular size of 16 kDa and can bind serum albumin (67 kDa) to become a larger molecule [17]. The superior accumulation of SMANCS in tumor tissues offered prolonged duration of action and increased therapeutic efficacy. The authors opined that EPR is made possible by an increased vascular permeability, a dysfunctional lymphatic drainage system, and the relative size of nanoparticles. They showed that very small molecules will traverse biological barriers easily, while larger molecules like nanoparticles may be filtered through highly vascularized and permeable barriers.",

To this end, the enhancement design of cell function and activity by making use of biomaterials is essential. In this review, 3D culture systems of cancer cells combined with several biomaterials for anticancer drug screening are introduced. Abstract Anticancer drug screening is one of the most important research and development processes to develop new drugs for cancer treatment. However, there is a problem resulting in gaps between the in vitro drug screening and preclinical or clinical study. This is mainly because the condition of cancer cell culture is quite different from that in vivo. As a trial to mimic the in vivo cancer environment, there has been some research on a three-dimensional (3D) culture system by making use of biomaterials. The 3D culture technologies enable us to give cancer cells an in vitro environment close to the in vivo condition. Cancer cells modified to replicate the in vivo cancer environment will promote the biological research or drug discovery of cancers. This review introduces the in vitro research of 3D cell culture systems with biomaterials in addition to a brief summary of the cancer environment.",

However, since a vascularization suddenly advances at the cancer sites under a nonphysiological condition, it is well recognized that the blood vessels in the cancer environment are fragile and the wall is highly permeable. Enhanced permeation and retention effect (EPR effect) is a concept to symbolize this condition of cancer blood vessels [60]. Based on the EPR effect concept, a positive targeting of micelles containing anticancer drug to cancer has been reported [61,62]. Thus, there are some structural and functional differences between the cancer and normal blood vessels. To study cancer characteristics or therapeutic efficacy, the blood vessel properties and the cancer-endothelial cell interaction are important to consider. Some research has been reported to demonstrate that tumor endothelial cells (TEC) differ from normal endothelial cells in properties, such as the cell proliferation, the gene expression, the response to growth factors, or migration [63,64]. High metastatic tumor-derived TEC (HM-TEC) and low metastatic tumor-derived TEC (LM-TEC) can be isolated from mice. It is demonstrated that the secretion levels of VEGF, MMP-2, MMP-9, and SDF-1 from HM-TEC are higher than from that of LM-TEC [60,65]. It is reported that coculture with endothelial cells facilitates the in vitro culture of cancer cells [66].",

Makino, Y. Tabata\n## Abstract\nSimple Summary For the research and development of drug discovery, it is of prime importance to construct the three-dimensional (3D) tissue models in vitro. To this end, the enhancement design of cell function and activity by making use of biomaterials is essential. In this review, 3D culture systems of cancer cells combined with several biomaterials for anticancer drug screening are introduced. Abstract Anticancer drug screening is one of the most important research and development processes to develop new drugs for cancer treatment. However, there is a problem resulting in gaps between the in vitro drug screening and preclinical or clinical study. This is mainly because the condition of cancer cell culture is quite different from that in vivo. As a trial to mimic the in vivo cancer environment, there has been some research on a three-dimensional (3D) culture system by making use of biomaterials. The 3D culture technologies enable us to give cancer cells an in vitro environment close to the in vivo condition. Cancer cells modified to replicate the in vivo cancer environment will promote the biological research or drug discovery of cancers. This review introduces the in vitro research of 3D cell culture systems with biomaterials in addition to a brief summary of the cancer environment.\n## Endothelial Cells\nIt is important for cancer cells to induce angiogenesis in terms of nutrient and oxygen supply, the elimination of waste products, invasion, and metastasis. However, since a vascularization suddenly advances at the cancer sites under a nonphysiological condition, it is well recognized that the blood vessels in the cancer environment are fragile and the wall is highly permeable. Enhanced permeation and retention effect (EPR effect) is a concept to symbolize this condition of cancer blood vessels [60]. Based on the EPR effect concept, a positive targeting of micelles containing anticancer drug to cancer has been reported [61,62]. Thus, there are some structural and functional differences between the cancer and normal blood vessels. To study cancer characteristics or therapeutic efficacy, the blood vessel properties and the cancer-endothelial cell interaction are important to consider. Some research has been reported to demonstrate that tumor endothelial cells (TEC) differ from normal endothelial cells in properties, such as the cell proliferation, the gene expression, the response to growth factors, or migration [63,64]. High metastatic tumor-derived TEC (HM-TEC) and low metastatic tumor-derived TEC (LM-TEC) can be isolated from mice. It is demonstrated that the secretion levels of VEGF, MMP-2, MMP-9, and SDF-1 from HM-TEC are higher than from that of LM-TEC [60,65]. It is reported that coculture with endothelial cells facilitates the in vitro culture of cancer cells [66].",

The underlying mechanism, which makes passive targeting possible, is the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. \n\nIt was observed that certain circumstances, such as inflammation/hypoxia, tumors, or infarcts, can determine an enhanced permeability of the endothelial lining of the blood vessel wall compared with the normal state of the tissue [6]. When reaching a given size, a tumor can no longer rely on the normal vasculature present in its vicinity to provide all the oxygen supply needed for its further proliferation. Therefore, as oxygen-deprived cells start to die, they secrete growth factors that promote the formation of new blood vessels from the surrounding capillaries, process known as angiogenesis [7]. These newly formed irregular blood vessels lack the basal membrane of normal vascular structures, thus presenting a discontinuous epithelium, which allows particles, such as nanocarriers (in the size range of 20-200 nm), to extravasate and accumulate inside the interstitial space [8]. Following permeation into the tumor, the enhanced accumulation of nanocarriers in the tumor microenvironment is favored by the poor lymphatic drainage in the tissue. In tumors, the lymphatic function is defective, resulting in minimal uptake of the interstitial fluid. Therefore, nanocarriers that have reached the perivascular space are not cleared efficiently and accumulate in the tumor interstitium [7]. This spontaneous accumulation or \"passive\" targeting is currently known as the EPR effect [9]. Utilization of the EPR effect is therefore an effective strategy for targeting nanopreparations, such as liposomes, to the site of a tumor and has been extensively documented using various tumor types and animal models, since its early discovery in 1980s by Matsumura and Maeda [10,11].",

            "abstract": "Photodynamic therapy (PDT) mostly relies on the generation of singlet oxygen, via the excitation of a photosensitizer, so that target tumor cells can be destroyed. PDT can be applied in the settings of several malignant diseases. In fact, the earliest preclinical applications date back to 1900\u2019s. Dougherty reported the treatment of skin tumors by PDT in 1978. Several further studies around 1980 demonstrated the effectiveness of PDT. Thus, the technique has attracted the attention of numerous researchers since then. Hematoporphyrin derivative received the FDA approval as a clinical application of PDT in 1995. We have indeed witnessed a considerable progress in the field over the last century. Given the fact that PDT has a favorable adverse event profile and can enhance anti-tumor immune responses as well as demonstrating minimally invasive characteristics, it is disappointing that PDT is not broadly utilized in the clinical setting for the treatment of malignant and/or non-malignant diseases. Several issues still hinder the development of PDT, such as those related with light, tissue oxygenation and inherent properties of the photosensitizers. Various photosensitizers have been designed/synthesized in order to overcome the limitations. In this Review, we provide a general overview of the mechanisms of action in terms of PDT in cancer, including the effects on immune system and vasculature as well as mechanisms related with tumor cell destruction. We will also briefly mention the application of PDT for non-malignant diseases. The current limitations of PDT utilization in cancer will be reviewed, since identifying problems associated with design/synthesis of photosensitizers as well as application of light and tissue oxygenation might pave the way for more effective PDT approaches. Furthermore, novel promising approaches to improve outcome in PDT such as selectivity, bioengineering, subcellular/organelle targeting, etc. will also be discussed in detail, since the potential of pioneering and exceptional approaches that aim to overcome the limitations and reveal the full potential of PDT in terms of clinical translation are undoubtedly exciting. A better understanding of novel concepts in the field (e.g. enhanced, two-stage, fractional PDT) will most likely prove to be very useful for pursuing and improving effective PDT strategies.",

                    "text": "There are two main strategies in terms of targeting the drugs to tumors; passive targeting and active targeting. As part of the passive targeting strategies, various nanocarrier agents have been used to promote their particular accumulation within tumors through the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect (Zhang et al., 2020). The EPR effect is a common concept for solid tumors associated with their pathophysiological and anatomical differences from normal tissues (Matsumura and Maeda, 1986). The EPR effect is manifested by enhanced accumulation of macromolecules (e.g. liposomes, drugs, and NPs) in tumor tissues in contrast to normal tissues. The mechanism underlying this effect is attributed to the leaky vessels around tumors as well as dysfunctional lymphatic system (Perrault and Chan, 2010;Maeda, 2013). The blood vessels with such leaky pores can augment the transport of circulating nanoparticles into the tumor. On the other hand, the transportation in nonmalignant tissues is hindered by the intact barrier of the vasculature. EPR effect has been proposed to be due to the rapid growth of tumor cells, which require surplus amounts of crucial nutrients; thus, inducing the dysregulated formation of blood vasculatures. The size of nanoparticles should be between 10 and 200 nm to achieve the passive targeting effect (Allison et al., 2008). The EPR effect is also dependent on other features of nanoparticles, such as the charge, the shape, circulation time in blood and hydrophilicity (Bertrand et al., 2014).

Gedik, Seylan Ayan\n## Abstract\nPhotodynamic therapy (PDT) mostly relies on the generation of singlet oxygen, via the excitation of a photosensitizer, so that target tumor cells can be destroyed. PDT can be applied in the settings of several malignant diseases. In fact, the earliest preclinical applications date back to 1900\u2019s. Dougherty reported the treatment of skin tumors by PDT in 1978. Several further studies around 1980 demonstrated the effectiveness of PDT. Thus, the technique has attracted the attention of numerous researchers since then. Hematoporphyrin derivative received the FDA approval as a clinical application of PDT in 1995. We have indeed witnessed a considerable progress in the field over the last century. Given the fact that PDT has a favorable adverse event profile and can enhance anti-tumor immune responses as well as demonstrating minimally invasive characteristics, it is disappointing that PDT is not broadly utilized in the clinical setting for the treatment of malignant and/or non-malignant diseases. Several issues still hinder the development of PDT, such as those related with light, tissue oxygenation and inherent properties of the photosensitizers. Various photosensitizers have been designed/synthesized in order to overcome the limitations. In this Review, we provide a general overview of the mechanisms of action in terms of PDT in cancer, including the effects on immune system and vasculature as well as mechanisms related with tumor cell destruction. We will also briefly mention the application of PDT for non-malignant diseases. The current limitations of PDT utilization in cancer will be reviewed, since identifying problems associated with design/synthesis of photosensitizers as well as application of light and tissue oxygenation might pave the way for more effective PDT approaches. Furthermore, novel promising approaches to improve outcome in PDT such as selectivity, bioengineering, subcellular/organelle targeting, etc. will also be discussed in detail, since the potential of pioneering and exceptional approaches that aim to overcome the limitations and reveal the full potential of PDT in terms of clinical translation are undoubtedly exciting. A better understanding of novel concepts in the field (e.g. enhanced, two-stage, fractional PDT) will most likely prove to be very useful for pursuing and improving effective PDT strategies.\n## Targeting Strategies\nThere are two main strategies in terms of targeting the drugs to tumors; passive targeting and active targeting. As part of the passive targeting strategies, various nanocarrier agents have been used to promote their particular accumulation within tumors through the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect (Zhang et al., 2020). The EPR effect is a common concept for solid tumors associated with their pathophysiological and anatomical differences from normal tissues (Matsumura and Maeda, 1986). The EPR effect is manifested by enhanced accumulation of macromolecules (e.g. liposomes, drugs, and NPs) in tumor tissues in contrast to normal tissues. The mechanism underlying this effect is attributed to the leaky vessels around tumors as well as dysfunctional lymphatic system (Perrault and Chan, 2010;Maeda, 2013). The blood vessels with such leaky pores can augment the transport of circulating nanoparticles into the tumor. On the other hand, the transportation in nonmalignant tissues is hindered by the intact barrier of the vasculature. EPR effect has been proposed to be due to the rapid growth of tumor cells, which require surplus amounts of crucial nutrients; thus, inducing the dysregulated formation of blood vasculatures. The size of nanoparticles should be between 10 and 200 nm to achieve the passive targeting effect (Allison et al., 2008). The EPR effect is also dependent on other features of nanoparticles, such as the charge, the shape, circulation time in blood and hydrophilicity (Bertrand et al., 2014). Even though the EPR effect has been demonstrated to have promising results in preclinical in vitro studies, there still exist important issues that should be solved in order to translate this approach into the clinical setting (Fang et al., 2011). The passive targeting strategy may fail to achieve the desired favorable therapeutic effects in certain early stage tumors, because of the regular vasculature of such tissues. Furthermore, vessel leakiness and permeability may not be homogeneous in a tumor tissue. Thus, targeting via EPR might yield heterogeneous effects (Peer et al., 2007).",

            "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PC) is the most frequent male cancer in the Western world. Progression to Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC) is a known consequence of androgen withdrawal therapy, making CRPC an end-stage disease. Combination of cytotoxic drugs and hormonal therapy/or genotherapy is a recognized modality for the treatment of advanced PC. However, this strategy is limited by poor bio-accessibility of the chemotherapy to tumor sites, resulting in an increased rate of collateral toxicity and incidence of multidrug resistance (MDR). Nanovectorization of these strategies has evolved to an effective approach to efficacious therapeutic outcomes. It offers the possibility to consolidate their antitumor activity through enhanced specific and less toxic active or passive targeting mechanisms, as well as enabling diagnostic imaging through theranostics. While studies on nanomedicine are common in other cancer types, only a few have focused on prostate cancer. This review provides an in-depth knowledge of the principles of nanotherapeutics and nanotheranostics, and how the application of this rapidly evolving technology can clinically impact CRPC treatment. With particular reference to respective nanovectors, we draw clinical and preclinical evidence, demonstrating the potentials and prospects of homing nanovectorization into CRPC treatment strategies.",

                    "text": "Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) Effect: Tumor cells, in a frantic attempt to mitigate the circumstance of limited diffusion, which negatively influences nutrient supply, oxygen supply and waste removal, engage in neoangiogenesis to step up vasculature. In order to avoid the imminent consequences of hypoxia, ischemia and toxicity, this process seems to occur very quickly and as a result, the contributions of the angiogenic regulators are largely excluded. This gives rise to highly disorganized and fenestrated tumor vessels, with discontinued endothelial linings and undesirable permeability to particles of up to 700 nm in diameter [63,64]. This pathologically orchestrated phenomenon is referred to as enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect [65] (Figure 2). Maeda et al. conceptualized and clearly demonstrated how angiogenic flaws associated with rapid tumor growth promoted site-specific accumulation and retention of nanoparticle-drug conjugates at the tumor site [65,66]. Taking advantage of the pressure gradient and leaky vessels at the tumor site, the nanoparticle-based drug accumulates at the tumor site, extravasates into the tumor microenvironment, and prolongs the release of therapeutic agents within the tumor with a resultant improvement in the treatment outcome. This emerged a land slide achievement in the field of nanomedicine and widened the scope of nanoparticle-based drug delivery via passive targeting such that new nanodrug formulations received approval for the treatment of other disease conditions such as fungal infection, hepatitis A, multiple sclerosis and end stage renal disease [67]. However, in order to maximize the advantages offered by EPR in the passive delivery of drugs, the size and surface properties of the nanocarrier must be controlled to avoid uptake by the reticuloendothelial system (RES) as previously described. The ideal size range to benefit from the EPR effect is between 10 to 200 nm as particles that are too small would be cleared by the kidneys, preventing accumulation into the tumor site, and particles that are too large will not adequately penetrate the tumor vasculature and interstitial space.",

Omabe, Cl\u00e9ment Paris, F. Lannes, D. Ta\u00efeb, P. Rocchi\n## Abstract\nProstate cancer (PC) is the most frequent male cancer in the Western world. Progression to Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC) is a known consequence of androgen withdrawal therapy, making CRPC an end-stage disease. Combination of cytotoxic drugs and hormonal therapy/or genotherapy is a recognized modality for the treatment of advanced PC. However, this strategy is limited by poor bio-accessibility of the chemotherapy to tumor sites, resulting in an increased rate of collateral toxicity and incidence of multidrug resistance (MDR). Nanovectorization of these strategies has evolved to an effective approach to efficacious therapeutic outcomes. It offers the possibility to consolidate their antitumor activity through enhanced specific and less toxic active or passive targeting mechanisms, as well as enabling diagnostic imaging through theranostics. While studies on nanomedicine are common in other cancer types, only a few have focused on prostate cancer. This review provides an in-depth knowledge of the principles of nanotherapeutics and nanotheranostics, and how the application of this rapidly evolving technology can clinically impact CRPC treatment. With particular reference to respective nanovectors, we draw clinical and preclinical evidence, demonstrating the potentials and prospects of homing nanovectorization into CRPC treatment strategies.\n## EPR Effect and Active Targeting in CRPC Therapy\nEnhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) Effect: Tumor cells, in a frantic attempt to mitigate the circumstance of limited diffusion, which negatively influences nutrient supply, oxygen supply and waste removal, engage in neoangiogenesis to step up vasculature. In order to avoid the imminent consequences of hypoxia, ischemia and toxicity, this process seems to occur very quickly and as a result, the contributions of the angiogenic regulators are largely excluded. This gives rise to highly disorganized and fenestrated tumor vessels, with discontinued endothelial linings and undesirable permeability to particles of up to 700 nm in diameter [63,64]. This pathologically orchestrated phenomenon is referred to as enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect [65] (Figure 2). Maeda et al. conceptualized and clearly demonstrated how angiogenic flaws associated with rapid tumor growth promoted site-specific accumulation and retention of nanoparticle-drug conjugates at the tumor site [65,66]. Taking advantage of the pressure gradient and leaky vessels at the tumor site, the nanoparticle-based drug accumulates at the tumor site, extravasates into the tumor microenvironment, and prolongs the release of therapeutic agents within the tumor with a resultant improvement in the treatment outcome. This emerged a land slide achievement in the field of nanomedicine and widened the scope of nanoparticle-based drug delivery via passive targeting such that new nanodrug formulations received approval for the treatment of other disease conditions such as fungal infection, hepatitis A, multiple sclerosis and end stage renal disease [67]. However, in order to maximize the advantages offered by EPR in the passive delivery of drugs, the size and surface properties of the nanocarrier must be controlled to avoid uptake by the reticuloendothelial system (RES) as previously described. The ideal size range to benefit from the EPR effect is between 10 to 200 nm as particles that are too small would be cleared by the kidneys, preventing accumulation into the tumor site, and particles that are too large will not adequately penetrate the tumor vasculature and interstitial space.",

Among the various nanostructures for drug delivery, drug delivery based on polymeric nanoparticles has numerous advantages for controlling the release of biological factors, such as the ability to add a selective targeting mechanism, controlled release, protection of administered drugs, and prolonging the circulation time in the body. In addition, the functionalization of nanoparticles helps to achieve the best possible outcome.

In fact, depending on the anatomic region of a tumor, the pore size of the endothelial junctions varies from 100 to 780 nm with a mean of approximately 400 nm (while normal vasculature is characterized by pores smaller than 10 nm), characterizing the leaky microvasculature of tumors; it is also characterized by a disrupted basement membrane, abnormal branching, and enlarged inter-endothelial gaps, with an associated breakdown of tight junctions between endothelial cells. Moreover, tumor vasculature lacks lymphatic drainage and is rich in fenestrations and poor in pericyte coverage. All these features contribute to the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, firstly described by Maeda and co-workers [95]; the tumor vasculature architecture allows extravasation and selective accumulation of nanodrugs in the tumor interstice via a passive targeting mechanism [25,96,97]. Thanks to their size, small molecules diffuse freely in and out of tumor blood vessels and thus do not accumulate in tumors as much as macromolecules do over time. These large gaps between endothelial cells facilitate the extravasation of particulate material from the surrounding vessels into a tumor (Figure 6), but EPR-dependent drug delivery is always compromised by regional blood flow rates, molecular size, polarity, and complexation to serum proteins, which are all factors that reduce the capability of bypassing the membranes of the endothelium. \n\nHowever, some stimulators result in enhanced vascular permeability and extravasation of macromolecules and thus increase the EPR effect. EPR augmenting factors include vasoconstrictors to raise systemic blood pressure, free radicals that affect the integrity of vascular endothelium, and vascular permeability promoters [98]. Therefore, it is clear that the EPR effect is a very heterogeneous phenomenon, varying dramatically from tumor to tumor and from patient to patient.",

Dal Bo, Maria Cristina Grimaldi, G. Toffoli, P. Macor\n## Abstract\nNanoparticle-based therapies have been proposed in oncology research using various delivery methods to increase selectivity toward tumor tissues. Enhanced drug delivery through nanoparticle-based therapies could improve anti-tumor efficacy and also prevent drug resistance. However, there are still problems to overcome, such as the main biological interactions of nanocarriers. Among the various nanostructures for drug delivery, drug delivery based on polymeric nanoparticles has numerous advantages for controlling the release of biological factors, such as the ability to add a selective targeting mechanism, controlled release, protection of administered drugs, and prolonging the circulation time in the body. In addition, the functionalization of nanoparticles helps to achieve the best possible outcome. One of the most promising applications for nanoparticle-based drug delivery is in the field of onco-hematology, where there are many already approved targeted therapies, such as immunotherapies with monoclonal antibodies targeting specific tumor-associated antigens; however, several patients have experienced relapsed or refractory disease. This review describes the major nanocarriers proposed as new treatments for hematologic cancer, describing the main biological interactions of these nanocarriers and the related limitations of their use as drug delivery strategies.\n## Passive Targeting in Tumor Microenvironment\nSolid tumors are characterized by a heterogeneous vasculature for size and distribution, constituted by a central avascular/necrotic region and a vascularized peripheral region, with discontinuous endothelium in the micro-vessels. In fact, depending on the anatomic region of a tumor, the pore size of the endothelial junctions varies from 100 to 780 nm with a mean of approximately 400 nm (while normal vasculature is characterized by pores smaller than 10 nm), characterizing the leaky microvasculature of tumors; it is also characterized by a disrupted basement membrane, abnormal branching, and enlarged inter-endothelial gaps, with an associated breakdown of tight junctions between endothelial cells. Moreover, tumor vasculature lacks lymphatic drainage and is rich in fenestrations and poor in pericyte coverage. All these features contribute to the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, firstly described by Maeda and co-workers [95]; the tumor vasculature architecture allows extravasation and selective accumulation of nanodrugs in the tumor interstice via a passive targeting mechanism [25,96,97]. Thanks to their size, small molecules diffuse freely in and out of tumor blood vessels and thus do not accumulate in tumors as much as macromolecules do over time. These large gaps between endothelial cells facilitate the extravasation of particulate material from the surrounding vessels into a tumor (Figure 6), but EPR-dependent drug delivery is always compromised by regional blood flow rates, molecular size, polarity, and complexation to serum proteins, which are all factors that reduce the capability of bypassing the membranes of the endothelium. \n\nHowever, some stimulators result in enhanced vascular permeability and extravasation of macromolecules and thus increase the EPR effect. EPR augmenting factors include vasoconstrictors to raise systemic blood pressure, free radicals that affect the integrity of vascular endothelium, and vascular permeability promoters [98]. Therefore, it is clear that the EPR effect is a very heterogeneous phenomenon, varying dramatically from tumor to tumor and from patient to patient.",

It is also an essential concept for designing anticancer drugs that can be selectively delivered into tumor tissue via the unique extravasation and retention mechanism for macromolecular drugs. As tumor vasculature is highly heterogeneous, the intensities of the EPR effect vary according to the types and locations of solid tumors in different species. However, the EPR effect is universally observed in a broad spectrum of solid tumors in human cancer as well as experimental animal tumor models. The matter is how to utilize the EPR effect for drug design and clinical application. Many hypotheses were proposed and tested to enhance the EPR effect in solid tumors in order to increase the efficacy of drug delivery. However, we should focus on increasing the blood flow in tumors so that more drugs can be perfused and accumulated inside tumor tissue and execute anticancer activities. Angiotensin II co-administration and the approach of intratumor arterial infusion should be considered to achieve selective tumor tissue perfusion for nanodrugs.",

            "text": "The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect is believed to be a universal mechanism occurring in most solid tumors and a key issue for selective delivery of nanomedicines to tumors [1][2][3][4][5][6]. Suppressed blood flow or obstructed blood vessels in advanced cancers lead to heterogeneity of the EPR effect [7][8][9][10][11][12]. Criticisms of the EPR effect were recently raised [13,14], probably because of inaccurate understanding of the EPR effect together with the use of inappropriate nanomedicines, particularly those lacking good stability in vivo and those with an inadequate or poor experimental design [7][8][9]. For instance, if the release of active pharmaceutical ingredients from liposomes is too slow because the complexes are very stable, even though they accumulates in tumors by EPR effect, the therapeutic outcome is poor [7][8][9][10][11][12]15]. \n\nThe EPR effect was first demonstrated in mouse tumor models in which the tumor size was usually smaller than 10 mm and the tumors were highly vasculated; nanomedicines thus had high permeability. In contrast, human tumors diagnosed in clinical situations are frequently larger than 3 mm and up to 10 cm or more. In such large tumors, blood flow is often suppressed or blood vessels are occluded because of the formation of vascular clots or thrombi [9][10][11][12][15][16][17][18]. This blood-flow suppression thus results in little or no drug delivery and, therefore, a highly limited EPR effect [9,12,[15][16][17][18]. However, Ding et al. observed that more than 87% of human renal tumors manifested a considerable EPR effect with significant diversity and heterogeneity in different patients [19]. Also, Lee et al. reported that nanoparticles conjugated with positron-emitting radionuclei such as 64 Cu resulted the EPR effect in breast cancer, including metastatic cancer [20].",

Large gaps exist between endothelial cells in tumor blood vessels, which lead to selective extravasations and retention of macromolecular drugs. This EPR effect served as a basis for development of macromolecular anticancer therapy. There are various factors, which lead to a significantly increased EPR effect and enhanced antitumor drug effects as well. This review discusses the unique anatomy of tumor vessels, molecular mechanisms of factors related to the EPR effect and the role of the EPR effect in the intratumoral delivery of protein and peptide drugs, macromolecular drugs and drug-loaded long-circulating nanocarriers.",

            "text": "The Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) effect is a phenomenon that leads to the enhanced accumulation and retention of macromolecules and nanoparticles in solid tumors compared to normal tissues [188,219]. This improved accumulation results from the tumor vasculature that grows abnormally in order to feed the rapidly growing tumor. This results in leaks in the vasculature, from which nanomedicines can penetrate the tumor. However, the EPR effect is not a universal property of all solid tumors and care should be taken when exploring this route of passive tumor targeting [219]. Some tumors have a very dense extracellular matrix with very limited EPR-based accumulation (e.g., pancreatic ductal carcinoma). In addition, analysis from 200 different patient tumors across eight different cancer types have revealed marked differences in the tumor vasculature and morphology, observed between tumor types, between tumors of the same type, and even within the same tumor [218,219]. Despite this large heterogeneity, a good number of patients could still benefit from EPR-based passive targeting, and improvements in diagnostics to identify which patients could benefit from EPR would lead to better treatment outcomes [220]. To make use of the EPR effect, PEGylation is commonly used to increase the circulation lifetime long enough to allow the accumulation of the therapeutic nanoparticles in the tumor. As described above, PEGylation can also be used to achieve tunable sizes in the 30-100 nm range [124,180], and this size tunability could be employed to improve perfusion in denser tumors.",

Over the last three decades, the development of cancer nanomedicines has resulted in thousands of publications and several approved drug products for the treatment of solid and hematological malignancies. In the context of solid tumors, the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect has become an important driver of cancer nanomedicine design and it has served as a key cornerstone of tumor-targeted drug delivery [1][2][3]. \n\nRecently, however, the importance and the existence of the EPR effect in human patients have been heavily debated [4][5][6]. It has been demonstrated that the mechanism by which nanoparticles enter solid tumors is more complex than previously thought (potentially going beyond simple extravasation through gaps in the endothelial lining) [7], and that immune cells in the tumor microenvironment play important roles in nanomedicines' accumulation, retention and intratumoral distribution [8,9]. In addition, it is clear that the EPR effect is significantly more pronounced in the small animal xenograft tumor models which are typically used to evaluate cancer nanomedicines in preclinical settings as compared to tumor growing in humans [10].

            "text": "This invited editorial article aims at reporting progress about the enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR for short), starting from a recent Special Issue in the Journal of Personalized Medicine (namely, \"EPR Effect-Based Tumor Targeted Nanomedicine\") and focusing specifically on one of these contributing articles, a review from Jun Wu entitled \"The Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) Effect: The Significance of the Concept and Methods to Enhance Its Application\", which has recently acquired the rank of a highly cited paper [1]. \n\nThe year 2021 was the 35th anniversary of the EPR effect's discovery when the first original paper of Matsumura and Maeda in Cancer Research was published in 1986 [2]. The EPR effect is a universal patho-physiological phenomenon and mechanism in which macromolecular compounds beyond a specific size can progressively accumulate in the tumor vascularized area and, in this way, carry out targeted delivery and retention of anticancer compounds in the solid tumor tissue [3]. It is believed that the EPR is an effective modality for cancer targeted delivery of a number of macromolecular compounds and drug-loaded nanocarriers [4]. In fact, it has been shown that tumor vessels are highly permeable to macromolecular compounds. After entering tumor tissue, these compounds are entrapped inside the tumor tissue for a prolonged period. Unfortunately, the development of nanomedicine has been hampered for decades in achieving therapeutic advantages in clinical practice. Actually, the existence and intensity of the EPR effect in human solid tumor circumstances have hardly been discussed [5,6]. The EPR effect has also been reported in solid tumors of animals and human patients [1][2][3]5]. The delivery efficiency of nanoparticles into human tumor tissue is very low compared to that in the animal tumor mode. Moreover, the extravasation mechanism for nanoparticles into tumors occurs through tumor vasculature gaps, and organelles [4]. \n\nIn his article, Jun Wu [1] brilliantly overviewed the advantages, pitfalls, and caveats of the EPR effect.",

            "text": "Solid tumors exhibit a special microenvironment featuring tortuous vascularity, angiogenesis, and hypoxia [1][2][3]. Abnormal tumor vasculature, high interstitial fluid pressure, growth-induced solid stresses. And solid stresses from the abnormal stromal matrix are the main limitations that prevent drugs from penetrating the solid tumor [4,5]. Therefore, the accurate and efficient delivery of theranostic agents into tumor lesions in a controlled manner is critical and remains a significant challenge till date. However, the absence of vascular supportive tissues in tumors results in the formation of leaky vessels with pores (200 nm to 1.2 \u03bcm in diameter) [6] and leads to poor lymphatic drainage, which is the structural basis of the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. The EPR effect is considered an effective method to achieve the passive targeting of tumor tissues [7,8]. In preclinical studies, targeted delivery systems based on EPR have demonstrated a remarkable improvement in anticancer efficacy when compared Ivyspring International Publisher with the efficacy of traditional chemotherapeutic drugs [7][8][9]. \n\nHowever, numerous parameters (such as vascular permeability and mutation, tumor cell density, and tumor stromal heterogeneity) prevent the successful application of EPR-based theranostics in clinical applications because of tumor heterogeneity [10][11][12][13][14][15]. Different patients with the same type of tumor, different types and sizes of tumor, and different developmental stages of the same tumor may show different EPR effects [16,17]. For example, hepatocellular carcinoma and renal cell carcinoma both have high vascular density and exhibit a strong EPR effect, whereas pancreatic and prostate cancers are characterized by low vascular density, resulting in a lower EPR effect [18]. Metastatic tumors have a high degree of necrosis at the central site relative to the primary tumor because of the lack of blood vessels due to the decrease in the EPR effect.",

            "text": "The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect is a property of macromolecules larger than 40 kDa or even 800 kDa (even as large as bacteria); these macromolecules include proteins such as albumin and immunoglobulin-G (IgG), polymer conjugates, liposomes, micellar drugs, nanoparticles, and other biocompatible macromolecular compounds [1][2][3][4][5]. The macromolecules tend to accumulate in tumor tissues much more than in normal tissues [1][2][3][4][5]. In 1986, Matsumura and Maeda found that the underlying mechanism of tumor-selective drug targeting is based on the unique characteristics of tumor blood vessels [6]. The causes of the EPR effect are (i) defective tumor blood vessels; (ii) various vascular effectors including nitric oxide (NO), bradykinin, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), carbon monoxide (CO) produced by heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and prostaglandins (e.g., prostaglandin E 2 , prostaglandin I 2 ) that facilitate extravasation; and (iii) impaired lymphatic clearance, so that macromolecular drugs remain in tumor tissues for extended periods [1,4,[7][8][9][10]. The EPR effect occurs not only in primary cancers but also in metastatic cancers including lymphatic, liver, and lung metastases and in inflamed tissues [4,[10][11][12]. Different researchers throughout the world have extensively verified the EPR effect in different tumor models as well as in cancer patients [2,[13][14][15]. \n\nThe heterogeneity of tumor tissues is another important issue because the EPR effect depends on tumor blood flow: no blood flow suggests a poor EPR effect or no EPR effect at all [10,11,16,17].",

            "text": "Tumor vasculature is characterized by a variety of abnormalities including irregular architecture, poor lymphatic drainage, and the upregulation of factors that increase the paracellular permeability. The increased permeability is important in mediating the uptake of an intravenously administered drug in a solid tumor and is known as the enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) effect. Studies in animal models have demonstrated a cut-off size of 500 nm - 1 \u00b5m for molecules or nanoparticles to extravasate into a tumor, however, surprisingly little is known about the kinetics of the EPR effect. Here we present a pharmacokinetic model to quantitatively assess the influence of the EPR effect on the uptake of a drug into a solid tumor. We use pharmacokinetic data for Doxil and doxorubicin from human clinical trials to illustrate how the EPR effect influences tumor uptake. This model provides a quantitative framework to guide preclinical trials of new chemotherapies and ultimately to develop design rules that can increase targeting efficiency and decrease unwanted side effects in normal tissue.",

            "text": "The Enhanced Permeability and Retention Effect (EPR) effect is a process that is explained by the hyperpermeation and extended retention of biomolecules encapsulated in nanocarriers, such as lipoproteins, hormones, and albumins, retained in solid tumors which contains leaky vasculature, elevated endothelial macromolecule transcytosis, and a lack of functional lymphatic drainage inside its interstitium (Figure 3). \n\nTo obtain EPR effect-based selective tumor deposition, low extravasation of normal-type tissue and renal clearance are needed. The nanoconstructs' reduced particle size, which is lower than tumour vascular permeability, allowed them to easily pass through and produce the EPR effect (600-800 nm). However, the nanoconstructs have the bigger particle size than the pore of blood capillary (6-12 nm) and renal filtration (5-6 nm), influences the targeting of NPs (Choi et al., 2009). \n\nMultiple tumors may develop tumor interstitium with different ECM (e.g., fibrin, fibronectin, hyaluronan collagen, and proteoglycans), tumor parenchyma and stroma cell compositions due to variations in the tumor type and stage. The variations in physical rigidity and pressure ranges may affect the distribution and transport of nanoconstructs in the tumor, which may further affect Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org 10 their therapeutic efficacy (Swartz and Lund, 2012;Perry et al., 2017). Hepatocellular carcinoma, Kaposi sarcoma, renal cell carcinoma, and cancer of the neck and head (Regev et al., 2005) are known to be high-level EPR tumors, whereas pancreatic ductal carcinoma and prostate cancer (Maeda, 2015) are referred to as low-EPR tumors. \n\nThere are other factors that hinder nanoconstructs distribution and deposition in tumors other than drawbacks of the EPR effect, such as biological and physical hurdles in delivering an adequate dosage of a therapeutic drug to the targeted site of the tumor.",

            "text": "Following its discovery more than 30 years ago, the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect has become the guiding principle for cancer nanomedicine development. Over the years, the tumor-targeted drug delivery field has made significant progress, as evidenced by the approval of several nanomedicinal anticancer drugs. Recently, however, the existence and the extent of the EPR effect - particularly in patients - have become the focus of intense debate. This is partially due to the disbalance between the huge number of preclinical cancer nanomedicine papers and relatively small number of cancer nanomedicine drug products reaching the market. To move the field forward, we have to improve our understanding of the EPR effect, of its cancer type-specific pathophysiology, of nanomedicine interactions with the heterogeneous tumor microenvironment, of nanomedicine behavior in the body, and of translational aspects that specifically complicate nanomedicinal drug development. In this virtual special issue, 24 research articles and reviews discussing different aspects of the EPR effect and cancer nanomedicine are collected, together providing a comprehensive and complete overview of the current state-of-the-art and future directions in tumor-targeted drug delivery.",

            "text": "The field of nanomedicine is rapidly gaining interest due to its application in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, especially the treatment of cancer. The promise of nanomedicine is in the tumor microenvironment. This microenvironment allows the nanoparticles to penetrate from the blood vessels into the interstitial space of the tumor and retain the particles in the tumor. This phenomenon, referred to as the enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR), is used to deliver large drug loads or imaging agents to the tumor site better than small molecules. The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect describes the preferential accumulation of nanoparticles in tumors due to their leaky vascular system and poor lymphatic drainage [151]. The EPR generated great enthusiasm for the development of nanoparticle therapy as an anticancer therapy. However, the results of preclinical studies assessing the EPR effect were inconclusive. Some reports confirm the preferential accumulation of nanodrugs in the tumor via EPR, while others show that the effect of EPR is strongly dependent on the tumor model. Today, the EPR remains a controversial topic in nanomedicine [152]. Hansen et al., using canine spontaneous tumors that closely mimic the human condition and 64Cu-labeled liposomes that can be imaged with positron emission tomography, showed that rapidly growing tumors such as carcinomas are highly vascularized and therefore have more porous and leaky blood vessels, while slow-growing tumors, such as sarcomas, are not very vascularized [153]. The main conclusion from this, and other EPR studies, is that the clinical application of EPR-enhancing agents, in combination with nanomedicine, requires preclinical studies con-ducted in appropriate models, the combination of nanomedicine with the EPR-enhancing strategy must be designed for a certain type of cancer, and side effects of EPR enhancing agents must be taken into consideration [154]. \n\nMany current cancer drug delivery systems attempt to go further than simply ensuring tumor accumulation. Attempts are being made to combine cancer cell-specific targeting with EPR-based accumulation.",

An important driver of passive targeting is the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, which is the cornerstone of most carrier-based tumor-targeted drug delivery efforts. Despite the huge number of publications showcasing successes in preclinical animal models, translation to the clinic has been poor, with only a few nano-based drugs currently being used for the treatment of cancers. Several barriers and factors have been adduced for the low delivery efficiency to solid tumors and poor clinical translation, including the characteristics of the nanocarriers and macromolecules, vascular and physiological barriers, the heterogeneity of tumor blood supply which affects the homogenous distribution of nanocarriers within tumors, and the transport and penetration depth of macromolecules and nanoparticles in the tumor matrix. To address the challenges associated with poor tumor targeting and therapeutic efficacy in humans, the identified barriers that affect the efficiency of the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect for macromolecular therapeutics and nanoparticle delivery systems need to be overcome. In this review, approaches to facilitate improved EPR delivery outcomes and the clinical translation of novel macromolecular therapeutics and nanoparticle drug delivery systems are discussed.",

            "text": "Enhanced accumulation of macromolecules in solid tumors and its mechanisms were first reported by Matsumura and Maeda in 1986 and termed the \"Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) effect\" [216]. The EPR effect is a phenomenon that occurs when the blood vessels surrounding a relatively large tumor become highly permeable while there is minimal lymphatic drainage from the tumor (Figure 7). This combination results in increased penetration of nanoparticles into the tumor and insufficient washing away of them by lymph. As a result, the particles accumulate and get retained in the tumor. As substances with high molecular weight, nanoparticles are naturally susceptible to this effect and, therefore, will passively accumulate in solid tumors. However, it has been observed that the use of enhanced EPR effects to transport nanomedicines to tumor sites is not consistently effective and is instead dependent on specific characteristics of the tumor and its physiological conditions [217]. Factors such as the degree of angiogenesis and lymphatic development, the amount of pericyte coverage in the tumor vasculature, the density of the tumor stroma, and intratumoral pressure are principal contributors to the variability in EPR effects. Understanding these aspects resulted in the creation of active targeting approaches, which currently represent the mainstream in cancer-targeted drug delivery under development and clinical trials. \n\nCancers 2024, 16, 1589 29 of 51 to this effect and, therefore, will passively accumulate in solid tumors.

            "text": "It is crucial to understand the pathophysiological characteristics of solid tumor growth, especially the compound transportation regulation of the tumor vasculature, in order to achieve selective drug delivery and therapeutic effects for cancer chemotherapy.It has been well observed that tumor vessels are highly permeable to macromolecular compounds.After entering tumor tissue, these macromolecular compounds are trapped inside the tumor tissue for a prolonged period of time.In 1986, Hiroshi Maeda and his colleagues from Kumamoto University School of Medicine coined the term enhanced permeability and retention effect (the EPR effect) to describe the unique pathophysiological phenomenon of the solid tumor vasculature [1].Since this theory is very important for understanding tumor vessel transportation regulation, the EPR effect has been well accepted as one of the universal pathophysiological characteristics of solid tumors, and acts as a fundamental principle for designing and developing tumor-targeting delivery of anticancer drugs [2,3].However, the development of nanomedicine has been frustrated for decades in achieving satisfactory therapeutic benefits in clinical practice.Therefore, the existence and intensity of the EPR effect in human solid tumor circumstances has been debated [4,5].For example, it is considered that the EPR effect is more significant in experimental small animal tumor models than in human tumors.The delivery efficiency of nanoparticles into human tumor tissue is very low compared to that in animal tumor models.The extravasation mechanism for nanoparticles into tumors is not only via the gaps between endothelial cells in the tumor vasculature, but also via the transcellular pathways by vesiculo-vacuolar organelles (VVOs) [6].Therefore, it is crucial to recognize the significance of the EPR effects, its pathophysiological mechanism, its pitfalls, and strategies for better harnessing this concept in drug development and clinical application.",

            "text": "Solid tumors are characterized, among other features, by the abnormal development of blood and lymphatic vessels, which results in increased vascular permeability and reduced lymphatic drainage compared to normal tissues.For this reason, intravenously administered mNPs can more readily accumulate in the tumor tissue.This process is known as the Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) effect and was first described by Prof. Maeda in 1986 [76].In the field of nanotechnology, the EPR effect has been extensively studied for both diagnosis and therapy of solid tumors, aiming to improve efficacy and reduce side effects in healthy tissues [77].In fact, it has been widely described as the most efficient mechanism for targeting mNPs in solid tumors [78][79][80][81].However, it is also known that the EPR effect varies depending on the type of tumor, its developmental stage, and the heterogeneity of blood vessels [82].\n\nThus, the EPR effect remains the subject of considerable controversy.For instance, aberrant tumor vasculature may translate into poor tissue perfusion and inefficient dis-semination of the therapeutic.Also, the increased interstitial pressure inside tumors is another physical barrier for passive tumor targeting.In 2014, Prof. Nichols commented that the attenuated impact of the EPR effect in the fight against cancer is likely the result of numerous factors, although none of them entirely invalidate it [83].In this regard, some of us have recently demonstrated that the limitations observed in the EPR effect are even more pronounced in the context of brain tumors [84].\n\nNonetheless, in certain cases, the EPR effect can serve as a good basis for achieving significant accumulations of mNPs in the tumor through their intelligent design, capable of utilizing intrinsic tissue properties that lead to stability changes of mNPs, allowing them to remain retained for longer periods.An example is the work by Tseng et al. [85], in which they reported the development of a lactate-responsive mNP carrier as a therapeutic approach for treating non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in a subcutaneous mouse model (H1975 cell line).",

            "text": "Simple Summary One of the important efforts in the treatment of cancers is to achieve targeted drug delivery by nanocarriers to be more effective and reduce adverse effects. However, due to the adverse responses of nanocarriers in clinical trials due to the very weak EPR effects, doubts have been raised in this regard. In this study, an attempt has been made to take a critical look at EPR approaches to enable the convergence of previous papers and the EPR critics to reach an appropriate therapeutic path. Although the effectiveness of EPR is highly variable due to the complex microenvironment of the tumor, there is high hope for cancer treatment by describing new strategies to overcome the challenges of EPR effect. Furthermore, in this paper an attempt was made to provide a reliable path for future to develop cancer therapeutics based on EPR effect. Abstract The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect in cancer treatment is one of the key mechanisms that enables drug accumulation at the tumor site. However, despite a plethora of virus/inorganic/organic-based nanocarriers designed to rely on the EPR effect to effectively target tumors, most have failed in the clinic. It seems that the non-compliance of research activities with clinical trials, goals unrelated to the EPR effect, and lack of awareness of the impact of solid tumor structure and interactions on the performance of drug nanocarriers have intensified this dissatisfaction. As such, the asymmetric growth and structural complexity of solid tumors, physicochemical properties of drug nanocarriers, EPR analytical combination tools, and EPR description goals should be considered to improve EPR-based cancer therapeutics. This review provides valuable insights into the limitations of the EPR effect in therapeutic efficacy and reports crucial perspectives on how the EPR effect can be modulated to improve the therapeutic effects of nanomedicine.",

            "text": "The concept of drug delivery to tumors by nanoparticles (NP) is largely based on the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect that relies on the anatomical and pathophysiological differences between solid tumors and normal tissues. Thus, the EPR effect is a functional consequence of such tumor features as abnormally leaky blood vessels and impaired lymphatic drainage that are beneficial for its growth and also enhance the extravasation and retention of macromolecules and colloids in the tumor. First reported by Matsumura and Maeda in 1986 [1], the EPR effect initially served as a basis for the development of anticancer therapy using macromolecular drugs but later it was also applied to colloidal drug delivery systems based on nanocarriers, such as polymeric nanoparticles, liposomes, and micelles. [1,2]. However, the results of the EPR-based delivery as a strategy for enhancing the selectivity of the antitumor drugs are often disappointing. One possible reason is a considerable inter-and intra-individual heterogeneity of tumors. Indeed, while the EPR effect is undoubtedly an intrinsic pathophysiological feature of solid tumors, it may change over time during tumor development and varies not only between animal models and patients, but even among tumors and metastases within the same patient [3,4]. This heterogeneity of tumors and complexity of the EPR phenomenon might be responsible, at least in part, for the limited translation of colloidal drug delivery systems into clinics [5][6][7][8]. Moreover, the EPR mechanisms has been much disputed. Thus, the earlier studies described the nanocarriers' entry into tumors as a result of their influx via the more or less permanent inter-endothelial gaps (or pores) in the tumor vessels, and it was therefore concluded that this influx depended on the cut-off size of these pores [9][10][11].",

While, the EPR effect is often explained as the presence of \"leaky\" tumor vasculature, the size-controlled delivery of nanoparticles varies dramatically among different cancer types [3][4][5]. In cancer patients, it is encouraging to see the incremental evidences of EPR using liposome and polymeric nanocarriers, which suggests that EPR is a clinically relevant phenomenon in certain cancer types or patient populations [3]. However, another suggestion is that the abnormal vascular fenestrations and leakiness of highly vascular human xenografts in mice may represent an experimental artifact [6,7]. Accordingly, \"EPR effect in patients\" and \"targeting principle beyond EPR\" become \"hot\" topics for research and translational nanomedicine study. In fact, there is a major debate on the effectiveness of EPR effect in cancer animal models and ultimately patients [3,6,8]. In a meta-analysis based on 10 years nanomedicine literature, the authors concluded that ~0.7% (median) of the injected nanoparticle dose accumulated in solid tumors [9]. Other experts indicated that the EPR effect of 0.7% was an unfair and unconventional calculation in determining nanomedicine tumor homing efficiency [10]. A recent literature further pointed out",

Despite the discovery and synthesis of hundreds of thousands of anticancer compounds targeting various crucial units in cancer cell proliferation and metabolism, the fundamental problem is the lack of targeting delivery of these compounds selectively into solid tumor tissue to maintain an effective concentration level for a certain length of time for drug-tumor interaction to execute anticancer activities. The enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR effect) describes a universal pathophysiological phenomenon and mechanism in which macromolecular compounds such as albumin and other polymer-conjugated drugs beyond certain sizes (above 40 kDa) can progressively accumulate in the tumor vascularized area and thus achieve targeting delivery and retention of anticancer compounds into solid tumor tissue. Targeting therapy via the EPR effect in clinical practice is not always successful since the strength of the EPR effect varies depending on the type and location of tumors, status of blood perfusion in tumors, and the physical-chemical properties of macromolecular anticancer agents. This review highlights the significance of the concept and mechanism of the EPR effect and discusses methods for better utilizing the EPR effect in developing smarter macromolecular nanomedicine to achieve a satisfactory outcome in clinical applications.",

            "text": "The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect is historically one of the most frequently cited advantages of nanoparticle cancer therapeutics [37]. As tumorigenesis occurs, the secretion of pro-angiogenic factors such as vascular epidermal growth factor (VEGF) induces the formation of a disordered, complex vascular network feeding tumor cells as they proliferate. High expression of VEGF in tumor tissue has been implicated in the formation of abnormal vascular wall morphology, where the endothelium lining the blood vessels contains large gaps-or \"leaky\" junctions-allowing for enhanced permeability of small particles and cells across the vascular wall. It is this enhanced permeability that is a double-edged sword for cancer: on the one hand, it is believed to enhance tumor metastasis by allowing the escape of tumor cells into the infiltrating vessels, which circulate them across the body to distant metastatic sites [38]; on the other hand, the leaky vasculature unique to the tumor microenvironment promotes the accumulation of systemically circulating nanoparticles at the tumor site, a phenomenon that should enhance the therapeutic efficacy of nanoparticle drugs against solid tumors. Despite the premise of the EPR effect to preferentially enhance the uptake of nanoparticles in tumors, the challenges we have outlined above clearly indicate there remains significant room for improving nanoparticle delivery. Uptake into tumor tissue via the EPR effect alone has been found to result in a mere 2-fold increase in accumulation of systemically injected drugs [39]. While drugs piggybacking on the EPR effect have excelled in preclinical models, they have yet to find clinical success in humans [40]. For many anti-cancer drugs, such as chemotherapeutics that are inherently toxic, systemic injection of even nanoparticle formulations must be done at very high doses to achieve significant drug accumulation via the EPR effect; this occurs, however, at the cost of off-target toxicity that limits the administered dose and therefore, the therapeutic efficacy of these drugs [39].",

Therefore, the augmentation of the EPR effect is critical for satisfactory anticancer nanomedicine. In this study, we focused on one vascular mediator involved in the EPR effect, carbon monoxide (CO), and utilized two CO generating agents, one is an extrinsic CO donor (SMA/CORM2 micelle) and another is an inducer of endogenous CO generation via heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) induction that is carried out using pegylated hemin. Both agents generated CO selectively in solid tumors, which resulted in an enhanced EPR effect and a two- to three-folds increased tumor accumulation of nanodrugs. An increase in drug accumulation in the normal tissue did not occur with the treatment of CO generators. In vivo imaging also clearly indicated a more intensified fluorescence of macromolecular nanoprobe in solid tumors when combined with these CO generators. Consequently, the combination of CO generators with anticancer nanodrugs resulted in an increased anticancer effect in the different transplanted solid tumor models. These findings strongly warrant the potential application of these CO generators as EPR enhancers in order to enhance tumor detection and therapy using nanodrugs.",

            "text": "The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect first coined by Matsumura and Maeda [16] is defined the phenomenon of macromolecules or high molecular weight drug and nanomedicine accumulation inside solid tumor models compared to healthy tissue counterparts [4]. EPR effect is usually induced by a leaky tumor vasculature by the accelerated angiogenesis and impaired lymphatic drainage by the disorganized growth of tumors [104,105]. In details, NPs with appropriate sizes can evade the tumor capillaries and be retained in the tumor tissues for days due to the lack of lymphatic drainage. Additionally, particles with high positive charges can bind non-specifically to the negatively charged luminal surface due to the presence of sulfate and carboxylate sugar moieties [106]. It is noteworthy that nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandins, and bradykinin, which act as vasodilators, can enhance the EPR effect in tumors by increasing their vascular permeability [107]. Furthermore, some nanomedicine formulations are effective in the treatment of multidrug resistance (MDR) [108]. In contrast, Jain et al. [109] claimed that elevated interstitial fluid pressure and heterogeneous blood supply limit macromolecular delivery to tumors. Furthermore, a key challenge is the promotion of the EPR effect in patients with EPR-insensitive tumor phenotypes since the EPR-insensitive phenotype is known to have smaller endothelial fenestrations, heterogeneously high or low pericyte coverage, more developed and branched vasculatures, a relatively dense ECR, and more developed immune profiles compared to EPR sensitive phenotypes [105]. Thus, the role of EPR is still in question in terms of clinical translation and different human tumor types due to their heterogeneity [105,110]. Among the three major targeted drug delivery methods, namely, passive targeting, active targeting, and physical targeting; passive targeting acts via the EPR effect, by which tumor cells preferentially absorb NPs [111].",

            "text": "The EPR effect is a particular paradox that occurs only in solid tumors, and it is directly related to their pathophysiological and anatomic characteristics, which differ from normal tissues. This effect was first described by Matsumura and Meda in 1986 and has been studied since then. Most solid tumors have abundant, but aberrant, vasculature and poor lymphatic drainage because of the compression of the cancerous cells and the dysfunctional lymphatic angiogenesis [120,[129][130][131]. Their blood vessels have an abnormal architecture and produce an excess of a variety of vascular permeability factors, resulting in an increased vascular permeability to ensure the supply of oxygen and nutrients to tumor tissues [129,130]. In addition, it has been demonstrated that the endothelial junctions of tumor blood vessels are larger than normal. Thus, macromolecules larger than 40 KDa, can percolate through these enlarged junctions and accumulate in the interstitial fluid and environment of the tumor. Therefore, the EPR effect depends on the molecular weight of molecules or particles, being only those larger than 40 KDa, which correspond to the limit of renal clearance, the ones that experiment this effect (Figure 3). In addition, these macrostructures remain in the tumor for a considerably long time (several days). The EPR effect has become the principal mechanism to consider in oncologic treatment design. Nanocarriers are designed to take advantage of this EPR effect and accumulate in the tumor environment to achieve the best targeting and therapeutic efficacy [120,131]. Only poorly vascularized tumors, mainly pancreatic, prostatic and liver metastatic experience less EPR effect than other types of cancer. Meda et al. [132] discovered that substances that emulate the effect of vascular mediators involved in EPR effect could enhance it, principally nitric oxide (NO), as well as bradykinin, prostaglandins and VEGF, by facilitating tumor angiogenesis and growth. Recent developments have also demonstrated that another vascular mediator, carbon monoxide (CO), also enhances this EPR effect. It has been demonstrated that this effect was more present when the systolic blood pressure was higher than normal.",

            "text": "A term of \"enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect\" was firstly proposed by Matsumura and Maeda in 1986 to describe the preferential accumulation of macromolecules in tumor, which has leaky capillaries, and at the same time, poor lymphatic drainage [57]. Size or molecular weight of the macromolecule is a key parameter determining the EPR effect in solid tumors (Figure 2). Typically, molecules with sizes ranging from 10 to 200 nm or 40 to 800 kilodaltons (kDa) in mass exhibit a strong EPR effect [58][59][60]. Such macromolecules include plasma proteins and NMs [61,62]. Small molecules tend to diffuse freely in and out of tumor blood vessels because of their small sizes, and thus do not accumulate in tumors as much as macromolecules do over time (Figure 2) [63]. Besides the size, other properties, such as shape and surface chemistry, also affect the EPR effect of NMs, which are discussed in recent reviews [31,64] and will not be elaborated here. \n\nThe EPR effect can be modulated by a number of in vivo factors. EPR augmenting factors include (1) vasoconstrictors to raise the systemic blood pressure [65], e.g., AT-II [66]; (2) free radicals that affect integrity of vascular endothelium, e.g., peroxynitrite [67]; (3) nitric oxide-releasing agents, e.g., nitroglycerin [68]; (4) vascular permeability promoters: bradykinin/kinin [69], prostaglandins, VEGF/VPF and other inflammatory cytokines [70]. These stimulators result in an enhanced vascular permeability and extravasation of macromolecules, and thus increase the EPR effect.",

            "text": "Prostate cancer remains a major global health challenge with the second highest cause of cancer death in men, with an unmet clinical need for improved therapeutic options (1, 2). Nanocarriers have emerged as a promising approach for delivering drugs to the tumor site, leveraging the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect to increase tumoral accumulation (3)(4)(5)(6). The EPR effect refers to the increased permeability and retention of macromolecules in the tumor microenvironment, which is characterized by leaky blood vessels and impaired lymphatic drainage (7)(8)(9). This effect has been demonstrated in a variety of solid tumors and is thought to be a key mechanism by which nanocarriers can accumulate selectively at the site of the tumor for a long period of time. \n\nHowever, multiple factors, including tumor vasculature and macrophages, have been shown to play a critical role in regulating the EPR-mediated selective accumulation and distribution of nanocarriers in tumors (7,(9)(10)(11)(12). Tumor blood vessels are highly heterogeneous and can vary significantly in terms of size, shape, and permeability (13,14). Macrophages, which are present in high numbers in the tumor microenvironment, can also play a role in the uptake and distribution of nanocarriers (10). In particular, solid tumors with poor vasculature may not allow nanocarriers to penetrate deep into the tumor tissue, potentially influencing therapeutic efficacy (15). For instance, nontargeted polymer nanostars demonstrated efficient tumor penetration and accumulation in highly vascular CT26 tumors but were unable to penetrate deep into BxPC3 tumors with low vascularity (15). Prior reports demonstrated low peripheral tumor accumulation of nontargeted nanocarriers in multiple prostate cancer models like CWR22Rv1, DU145, and PC3, highlighting their EPR-low status (15)(16)(17).",

            "text": "The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect was defined by Matsumura and Maeda as an intratumoral phenomenon resulting from the increased leakiness of newly forming tumor vessels as well as decreased lymphatic drainage. 1 Therapy based on the EPR effect has not been the expected success, 2 possibly due to individual patient EPR variations, and patient stratification might be central to fully exploit the therapeutic potential of liposomal drugs. 4][5][6][7][8] We have performed extensive studies of the EPR effect using a radiolabeled 64 Cu-liposome formulation. 9 Based on PET/CT imaging of spontaneous malignant tumors in canine cancer patients, we have demonstrated that the EPR-effect is not ubiquitous, even for tumors with a similar histopathology. 10 Molecular imaging techniques, such as 64 Cu-liposome PET/CT, could potentially serve as the basis for selecting patients with a high EPR effect for liposome based chemotherapy (the theranostic principle), as has already been shown clinically. 7 This has a large potential for improving the response rates to liposomal chemotherapy. 11 However, for liposomes to accumulate via the EPR effect in solid tumors, a long circulating half-life is mandatory. This is generally achieved by decorating liposomes with varying levels and lengths of polyethylene glycol (PEG), a method known as PEGylation. 12 Unfortunately, PEG decoration has the ability to induce the formation of anti-PEG IgM antibodies. 13 Anti-PEG antibody formation is highly problematic for subsequent administrations of PEGylated liposomes, as it leads to a rapid liposome clearance, and thereby eliminates the possibility to achieve EPR dependent tumor accumulation. This problem has been termed \"the accelerated blood clearance (ABC) phenomenon\" and is well described in experimental animals. 14 Most PEGylated liposomes containing chemotherapeutics do not seem to induce anti-PEG antibodies, probably because the B-cells responsible for producing anti-PEG antibodies do not survive exposure to liposomal chemotherapy. 15,16",

Passive tumor targeting via enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect has long been considered as the most effective mechanism for the accumulation of nanoparticles. Whereas, the vascular pore size of brain tumors is much smaller (only 7 ~ 100 nm) and the EPR is much weaker. Therefore, it is still difficult for drugs to reach brain tumor sites through the EPR effect (Caro et al., 2021). Hence, BBTB is considered to be another major obstacle for the drug transport in the treatment of brain tumors, critically restricting the delivery of drugs to tumor tissues.",

            "title": "An Updated Review on EPR-Based Solid Tumor Targeting Nanocarriers for Cancer Treatment",
            "text": "As seen in several papers, the high accumulation of drug nanocarriers in normal tissues can lead to undesirable toxicity through drug release and catalytic activity [111]. With this new perspective, it can be hoped that the actual accumulation of drug nanocarriers into solid tumors will result in a promising therapeutic target for cancer treatment, especially by enhanced tumor penetration of the drug. Therefore, to enhance therapeutic activities in solid tumors, accepting the EPR effect, along with recruiting combined therapeutic modalities to trigger the penetration of drug nanocarriers into malignant cells, can result in improved nano-based precision carriers for targeting therapeutic and diagnostic agents in the treatment of cancer. However, the accumulation of drug nanocarriers in solid tumors, especially in peritumoral areas, could be an EPR-independent strategy. Therefore, based on the nature of the nanocarriers and drug availability, a new delivery nanoplatform could be developed for tracking and treating poorly vascularized solid tumors. Another strategy to modulate EPR is the manipulation of drug nanocarriers through surface charge modifications, cluster size, flexible shape, and surface coatings for greater stability, with or without external inducers, to augment the permeability of tumor-associated vessels [6,112,113]. Modifications applied to drug nanocarriers to enhance the EPR effect usually do not result in potential active targeting. Since the effect of EPR indicates a high accumulation of targeted nanocarriers in the stromal tissue of solid tumors, overtaking the inflow on outflow of drug nanocarriers can lead to inactive or semi-active accumulation of nanocarriers in solid tumors using the EPR effect. \n\nCompetition is also one of the most important strategies in the development of therapeutic nanomedicine for solid tumors. Indeed, the main competitors of EPR-based treatment of solid tumors are the liver, spleen, lung, and kidney. Therefore, reducing the clearance of drug nanocarriers by modulating the physicochemical properties of nanocarriers matched to the TME of solid tumors can improve EPR-based tumor targeting and cancer nanomedicine treatment efficacy. As mentioned in Section 3, altering the physicochemical properties of drug nanocarriers can alter penetration into tumor tissue.",

Within solid tumors, the microenvironment is often characterized by high cell density, irregular blood vessel structures, elevated interstitial pressure, and an acidic milieu, which collectively impede drug penetration. These physiological barriers may prevent therapeutics from accessing solid tumors and lead to suboptimal treatment outcomes. Matsumura and Maeda's pioneering work demonstrated that nanoparticles can extravasate through inherently leaky and loosely compacted tumor vasculature, remaining within the tumor space due to poor lymphatic drainage; this effect is known as Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) [173]. Despite the EPR-mediated enhancement of passive targeting, a modest < twofold increase in nanodrug entry was measured in tumors compared to normal organs [174]. Thus, the intratumor drug concentrations achievable with passively targeted nanoparticles may be inadequate for effective treatment of most cancers [175,176].",

When SMANCS was administered to mice, drug accumulation in tumors was markedly increased compared with accumulation of the parental drug NCS. This momentous result led to discovery of the enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR effect) in 1986. Later, the EPR effect became known worldwide, especially in nanomedicine, and is still believed to be a universal mechanism for tumor-selective accumulation of nanomedicines. Some research groups recently characterized the EPR effect as a controversial concept and stated that it has not been fully demonstrated in clinical settings, but this erroneous belief is due to non-standard drug design and use of inappropriate tumor models in investigations. Many research groups recently provided solid evidence of the EPR effect in human cancers (e.g., renal and breast), with significant diversity and heterogeneity in various patients. In this review, we focus on the dynamics of the EPR effect and restoring tumor blood flow by using EPR effect enhancers. We also discuss new applications of EPR-based nanomedicine in boron neutron capture therapy and photodynamic therapy for solid tumors.",

            "text": "The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect is the main mechanism described so far by which nanocarriers are more likely accumulated in solid tumor sites than in normal tissues [53][54][55]. The EPR effect exploits the proliferation of endothelial cells during rapid and defective angiogenesis (i.e., the formation of new blood vessels from existing ones) and the lack of adequate lymphatic drainage. There is a loss of tight junctions and significant gaps between endothelial cells [32] that varies from 100 nm to 2 \u00b5m, depending on the type and stage of a tumor [32,54]. The size of nanocarriers plays the most critical role in EPR-based passive tumor targeting. Only nanocarriers smaller than the gap can extravasate from the vasculature and accumulate in tumor sites [31][32][33]. The accumulated nanocarriers are retained due to the dysfunctional lymphatic drainage in tumors, which allows them to release drugs into the vicinity or inside the tumor cells [33]. In general, a higher retention of nanocarriers allows a higher extravasation and accumulation in the tumor sites, which is a better EPR-based passive tumor targeting. Nanocarriers with sizes between 30-200 nm are proposed as optimal for EPR-based passive tumor targeting [32]. Besides, EPR-based passive tumor targeting is time-dependent and requires a long circulation half-life of nanocarriers.",

            "text": "In the field of nanomedicine, particularly in the design and application of NPs for tumor treatment, the EPR effect is considered a key mechanism 135 . Nanomedicines target tumor tissue by exploiting the EPR effect, which utilizes the permeability of tumor vasculature and defects in the lymphatic system for passive accumulation in solid tumors. Discovered in 1986, the EPR effect has been crucial in cancer nanotherapy 136 . However, it varies because of the complexity and heterogeneity of the tumor microenvironment, with its abnormal structure of tumor blood vessels, high interstitial pressure, and uneven blood flow. The EPR effect also varies significantly among patients, tumor types, and even between primary tumors and metastases within the same patient 137 . This leads to uneven distribution of NPs within the tumor, thereby limiting their therapeutic effects 138 . This variability results in cancer nanomedicines having different levels of accumulation and therapeutic effects in different tumors and patients 139 . Therefore, to enhance the accumulation of nanomedicines in tumors with low EPR effects, researchers have proposed several alternative targeting strategies, including tumor vasculature targeting, cell-mediated tumor targeting, tumor-penetrating peptides, iRGD (internalizing arginine-glycine-aspartate, CRGDK/RGPD/EC)-facilitated transendothelial extravasation, improved tumor penetration, and local delivery methods 140 . \n\nA key challenge in translating the EPR effect from animal models to human clinical applications stems from significant differences between animal and human vasculature. For instance, animal models, particularly rodent tumors, often show stronger EPR effects because of higher blood flow and distinct vascular architecture. Studies have shown that rodent tumors have an average blood flow of 5.4 mL/100 g/min, while human tumors range between 30 and 64.8 mL/100 g/min, leading to less efficient NP accumulation in human tissues. Additionally, higher interstitial fluid pressure and solid stress in human tumors further limit drug penetration. Overcoming these barriers is crucial for improving the clinical efficacy of EPR-based nanomedicines 141 . \n\nTherefore, researchers have focused on improving permeability and retention to enhance NP accumulation within tumors 142 .",

It is an important concept in the field of nanoparticle-based drug delivery for cancer treatment. The EPR effect arises from the unique characteristics of tumor blood vessels and the tumor microenvironment. Compared to normal blood vessels, tumor blood vessels are often leaky, irregularly shaped, and have poor lymphatic drainage. These abnormal blood vessels result from the rapid and disorganized growth of tumor cells, leading to incomplete and insufficient vascular networks within the tumor tissue. The leaky blood vessels in tumors allow nanoparticles to extravasate or \"leak out\" into the tumor interstitial space more easily than in healthy tissues. Furthermore, due to the lack of functional lymphatic vessels, the clearance of these extravasated nanoparticles from the tumor tissue is limited. As a result, the nanoparticles can accumulate and persist in the tumor for an extended period, providing an opportunity for effective drug delivery. The EPR effect is size-dependent, with nanoparticles in the range of tens to hundreds of nanometers exhibiting the highest accumulation in tumor tissues. These nanoparticles can passively extravasate through the enlarged pores in tumor Shaily Tyagi, Ashish Kumar, Anurag Chourasia, Saket Saini, Deeksha, and Anjali Dixit International Journal of Research -GRANTHAALAYAH 7 blood vessels, allowing them to reach the tumor interstitial space. However, larger nanoparticles may face difficulties penetrating deeper into the tumor due to increased interstitial pressure.The EPR effect has been utilized in the design of nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems. Nanoparticles can be engineered to carry anticancer drugs, imaging agents, or therapeutic agents specifically to the tumor site, taking advantage of the EPR effect. By encapsulating drugs within these nanoparticles, they can be protected from premature degradation, improve their stability, and allow for sustained release at the tumor site. This targeted delivery approach aims to enhance treatment efficacy while reducing the systemic toxicity associated with conventional chemotherapy.",

            "text": "For more than three decades, enhanced permeability and retention (EPR)-effect-based nanomedicines have received considerable attention for tumor-selective treatment of solid tumors. However, treatment of advanced cancers remains a huge challenge in clinical situations because of occluded or embolized tumor blood vessels, which lead to so-called heterogeneity of the EPR effect. We previously developed a method to restore impaired blood flow in blood vessels by using nitric oxide donors and other agents called EPR-effect enhancers. Here, we show that two novel EPR-effect enhancers\u2014isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN, Nitrol\u00ae) and sildenafil citrate\u2014strongly potentiated delivery of three macromolecular drugs to tumors: a complex of poly(styrene-co-maleic acid) (SMA) and cisplatin, named Smaplatin\u00ae (chemotherapy); poly(N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide) polymer-conjugated zinc protoporphyrin (photodynamic therapy and imaging); and SMA glucosamine-conjugated boric acid complex (boron neutron capture therapy). We tested these nanodrugs in mice with advanced C26 tumors. When these nanomedicines were administered together with ISDN or sildenafil, tumor delivery and thus positive therapeutic results increased two- to four-fold in tumors with diameters of 15 mm or more. These results confirmed the rationale for using EPR-effect enhancers to restore tumor blood flow. In conclusion, all EPR-effect enhancers tested showed great potential for application in cancer therapy.",

Several factors result in the heterogeneity of the tumor such as stage and size of the tumor, primary metastatic nature, and pathological characteristics. Two main approaches are employed to restore effective blood perfusion to the tumor site. This results in the mitigation of tumor heterogeneity and vasculature, normalizing disorganized tumor vasculature, and unblocking the occluded vessels are the two main approaches in achieving uniform drug delivery to the tumor site as shown in Figure 1 [13,21,22]. \n\nthe dynamicity of the EPR effect, fabricate improved nanodrugs effective for passive delivery, recognize patients with high-EPR tumors expected to respond to nanodrugs, improve the imaging methods for detecting and quantifying the EPR in tumors both in animal models and human. Thus, a synergistic combination of multiscale imaging with computational modeling may enhance the knowledge of the EPR effect [18]. Further, modeling to direct the management of the EPR effect, and different features of TME for enhancing nanodrug function may be the crucial approach for the improvement of EPR-based tumor targeting. Integrating multimodal imaging will benefit the quantitative evaluation of the EPR effect in tumors both in human and suitable animal models ensuing advancement of EPR-mediated drug delivery strategies [19].",

Besides, the EPR effect achieved in rodent models cannot be reproduced clinically because human tumors have heterogeneity or lack fenestrations in the tumor endothelium, acidic and anoxic areas, low and heterogeneous pericyte coverage, and high interstitial fluid pressure induced by a dense extracellular matrix (Danhier, 2016).",

            "text": "There has been much progress in the development of nanomedicines for use cancer imaging and therapy [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20]. To increase the potential for clinical application, nanomedicines with increased precision and safety have recently been designed and evaluated. Following intravenous administration, particles with a certain size range can localize to the tumor region through an \"enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect\" [21][22][23]. Molecules or particles with a size of >40 kDa (renal clearance threshold) may be present in the systemic circulation for a prolonged period [22,23]. Leaky tumor vasculature and insufficient lymphatic drainage of tumor tissue can increase the permeability and accumulation of particles [24]. Although the EPR effect has been proved in many animal studies, its usefulness for clinical application is still controversial [21]. The pathophysiological states are different according to the animal species (rodent versus human), tumor types originated from same source, and primary versus metastatic tumors in the same patient [21]. Consideration of the heterogeneity of EPR effect is necessary for the successful translation of nanomedicines to the clinical situation [21]. As drug delivery via EPR does not usually occur in normal tissues, it can be used as a passive tumor-targeting strategy [25]. However, the heterogeneity of tumor tissue, including highly hypovascular areas and necrotic tissues, frequently observed in large tumors may limit the efficiency of particle delivery. In addition to various factors that modulate the EFR effect [26] (e.g., bradykinin, nitric oxide derivatives, prostaglandins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF]), ligand-receptor interactions have been introduced as an active tumor-targeting strategy [27].",

            "text": "The mechanism of improved efficacy for liposomal formulations is often attributed to passive targeting that results in the accumulation of liposomes in tumors due to the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect [19][20][21][22].The EPR effect is thought to allow nanoparticles within blood vessels to extravasate into tumor tissue because the tumor vasculature is immature and leaky, and the associated lack of a lymphatic system does not allow fluids with liposomes to leave the site [23][24][25][26][27].However, the role of the EPR effect in improving drug efficacy is controversial [28,29].Investigators have reported that the EPR effect is heterogeneous and likely not relevant in all tumors [30,31].This may be particularly relevant for metastatic disease, where inter-lesion heterogeneity in drug delivery may limit the benefit of any EPR effect seen in solid tumor preclinical models [32,33] as well as in the treatment of primary tumors in the clinic [34].While some investigators are trying to augment or enhance the EPR effect [33] to overcome the challenges of heterogeneous retention, others have reported that the accumulation of liposomal formulations in tumor tissues may be more likely due to active processes such as transcytosis [35,36], therefore strategically coopting cellular uptake mechanisms through drug design, may be more fruitful in achieving better therapeutic effects.Relevant to our findings, it has also been shown that improved efficacy with liposomal formulations may not be dependent on tumor-specific accumulation at all, but may instead be due to the prolonged circulation lifetime of liposomes and the slow release of active drug cargo over time [37][38][39].An effect we have previously demonstrated for liposomal camptothecins in colorectal cancer models [40].\n\nThe objective of the experiments conducted in this study was to lay the groundwork for investigating the potential of designing liposomes to address challenges of heterogeneous TMEs.",

Therefore, this review discusses changes in structure as the tumor grows and how fluid flow, convection/diffusion, and the physicochemical properties of nanocarriers affect the EPR-based transport of nanocarriers in solid tumors.

            "text": "Main Barriers to Drug Distribution inside Tumors: Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) Effect, Tissue Interstitial Fluid Pressure (IFP) and Protein Corona Most therapies have not attained optimal biodistribution for efficient cancer targeting. Solid tumors provide specific challenges owing to their sophisticated, disorganized, and permeable circulatory networks, along with larger lymphatic regions that generate elevated interstitial fluid pressure (IFP). Although nanoparticles (NPs) are thought to use the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect to achieve targeted dispersion, this has not consistently resulted in significant therapeutic advantages when compared to preclinical studies [44]. Nanotechnology-based systems must successfully deal with pressure differentials. Furthermore, the tumor stroma, which is made up of several cellular and extracellular components, acts as a barrier causing the loss of most of the drug dose before reaching the target site [45]. Researchers aim to enhance drug concentrations within tumors while minimizing exposure to sensitive healthy areas. \n\nThe EPR effect refers to the passive accumulation of macromolecules in tumors, enabled by heightened vascular permeability that permits bigger molecules to cluster in tumor sites. This notion is essential in nanomedicine [46,47]. Subsequent to Maeda's groundbreaking research, numerous EPR-permitted nanoparticles have been created for cancer treatments [48,49]. The EPR impact is contingent upon particle size, as particles over 40 kDa persist in the body longer due to challenges in renal clearance [50][51][52][53]. Tumor angiogenesis is crucial, but additional characteristics-such as dimensions, morphology, and surface chemistry-also markedly improve biodistribution and retention in tumor tissues [54]. Nonetheless, the practical application of the EPR effect is hindered by several physicochemical obstacles, such as inadequate internalization, interactions with the extracellular matrix (ECM), and particle biocompatibility [51,55]. \n\nIFP acts as a barrier to effective drug distribution in two ways first, intensified lymphatic drainage and secondly, increased ECM stiffness in tumors [56,57].",

            "text": "Enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect is the basic concept for the tumor-targeted delivery of macromolecular anticancer agents [1,2]. It is based on the unique physiological and anatomical nature of tumor tissues, which show as high vascular permeability and defected lymphatic clearance, and consequently, the progressive accumulation of macromolecules into tumor tissues is observed [1,2]. Many anticancer nanodrugs have been developed based on the EPR effect that show a superior tumor targeting effect and therapeutic activities [3][4][5][6][7]. However, the concept of the EPR effect was primarily based on small size/early stage solid tumors in mice. In contrast, many cancers seen in clinics are at an advanced stage and are of a large size. The blood vessels of such tumors are often occluded or embolized [8][9][10][11]. Also, the advanced large tumors have many necrotic areas or degenerated blood vessels, and tumor blood flow is always irregular, so one can claim that the EPR effect also exhibits a high degree of heterogeneity [5,6]. Because of such suppressed blood flow as seen by angiography, drug delivery to tumors is frequently very poor. As a matter of fact, many refractory tumors, such as pancreatic cancer and metastatic liver cancer, have poor blood flow, thus even nanodrugs or sophisticated antibody drugs cannot be effectively delivered into the tumor. Thus, the challenges to open-up tumor blood vessels and restore tumor blood flow are critical and of great importance for anticancer nanomedicine. \n\nBased on this knowledge, we have developed a method counteracting against the problems by using a vascular dilator, nitric oxide (NO) donor such as nitroglycerin (NG), and an angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor such as enarapril [5,6,12,13]. We and other groups have further described additional strategies to enhance the EPR, and thus the therapeutic effect of anticancer nanodrugs using nano-designed NO donors [14,15].",

            "text": "The enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR) is a phenomenon involving solid tumors where their porous vasculature and secretion of elevated levels of vascular permeability factors create an environment that promotes tumor growth (i.e. necessary levels of oxygen and nutrients) [60]. Since the onset of this discovery, cancer therapies have exploited the distinct tumor microenvironment to deliver therapeutics to cancer tissue [61]. Within the context of brain tumors, passive targeting is especially significant as glioma vasculature is considerably hypervascularized, leaky, and deficient of a proper lymphatic drainage system. This creates an ideal environment for the uptake and retention of nanoparticles in tumor tissues, while sparing healthy brain cells [62]. It has been shown that passive targeting can be enhanced by localizing supermagnetic nanoparticles within glioma through an externally applied magnetic field [63]. In one study using this approach, magnetic paclitaxel nanoparticles significantly increased the survival of glioma-bearing rats when compared with free paclitaxel [64]. Regardless, the efficacy of EPR-based nanoparticle delivery for glioma therapy is still under question because of glioma's pathophysiological heterogeneity. It has been well reported that the core of gliomas consists of hypovascularized or necrotic tissue. Therefore, these central areas of the tumor do not exhibit an active EPR effect [65]. Moreover, it is thought that the existence of a \"hypoxic niche\" supports the small subpopulation of tumor stem cells that are responsible for glioma growth, progression, and disease recurrence [66,67]. The access of nanoparticles to the hypoxic core may therefore be crucial for therapeutic impact.",

This mechanism describes the intrinsic ability of macromolecules to reach and accumulate in the solid tumors' interstitium, based on tumor pathophysiological characteristics such as: (i) neovascularization, characterized by deficient basement membranes and fenestrated structures of endothelial tubes, (ii) upregulation of inflammatory factors and (iii) lack of efficient drainage of lymphatic systems, that together sustain the delivery, accumulation and retention of molecules into solid tumor tissues [35,36]. Passive targeting exploits the EPR effect on the delivery and retention of drugs at target site. However, in clinical settings, this strategy has not always worked as well as hoped due to a variety of factors, including the tumor type, location, blood perfusion status, physical-chemical characteristics of delivered agents and difficulty in predicting the distribution of drugs.",

Utilizing these pathological properties, macromolecular substances that do not ordinarily leak out of normal blood vessels can leak easily from tumor blood vessels, and macromolecules that leak locally into the cancer tissue stay in place for a long time because of a lack of efficient lymphatic drainage. As a result, highly stable macromolecular substances that are not captured by the reticuloendothelial systems in the body and are not filtered from the renal glomerulus can accumulate selectively in cancer tissue. Collectively, these ideas are termed the enhanced permeability retention (EPR) effect 15 ( Figure 1).

(A) Small molecules easily leak from normal vessels, but macromolecules (including IgG) are too large to pass through normal vessel walls. (B) Even macromolecules can extravasate from tumor vessels and be retained in the tumor tissue for long periods of time due to the EPR effect (modified from Matsumura [2012] 26) them, IgG accumulated most efficiently. That is, IgG retains not only active targeting based on the antigen-Ab reaction, but also passive targeting ability. Animal experiments have contributed to the development of drug delivery systems (DDSs) for several payloads such as anticancer agents and nucleic acids, and these approaches have been accepted worldwide. 16,17 However, some clinical problems remain, and DDSs based on the EPR are not fully functional. 18 It has become clear that the most important mechanism underlying the EPR effect is tumor vascular hyperpermeability caused by the production of vascular permeability factors associated with cancerinduced hypercoagulation of blood. This increase in blood coagulation results in formation of cancer stroma, which interferes with the EPR effect. 19",

These changes result in promotion of tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis, but also in tumor resistance to drugs and radiotherapy. The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect in neo-angiogenic tumor tissue enables the transport of therapeutic molecules from the circulation into the tumor, but studies show that further diffusion of these agents is often not sufficient for efficient tumor eradication. Despite the hyperpermeable vasculature facilitating the delivery of drugs and tracers, the high density of stromal cells and matrix proteins, in combination with the elevated interstitial fluid pressure in the microenvironment of solid tumors, presents a barrier which limits the delivery of compounds to the core of the tumor. Reversing the cancer-cell-induced changes to the microenvironment as well as novel nanoparticle strategies to circumvent tumor-induced stromal changes have therefore been suggested as potential methods to improve the delivery of therapeutic molecules and drug efficacy. Strategies to modulate the TME, i.e., normalization of tumor vasculature and depletion of excessive stromal proteins and cells, show promising results in enhancing delivery of therapeutic compounds. Modulation of the TME may therefore enhance the efficacy of current cancer treatments and facilitate the development of novel treatment methods as an alternative for invasive resection procedures.",

The EPR effect is based on two key features of tumor biology: increased vascular permeability and impaired lymphatic drainage. The leaky structure and gaps between the epithelial tumor cells cause the IONPs to easily extravasate and retain in the tumor interstitium for longer time. 82,83 However, this phenomenon is not universal and depends on various factors such as physical characteristics of patient, type and location of tumor etc. For instance, in glioblastoma treatment, the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and blood-brain tumor barrier (BBTB), poses signi\ue103cant challenges to EPR which relies on the passive accumulation of IONPs in tumors owing to leaky vasculature. 83,84 everal studies have reported tumor accumulation of IONPs via the EPR effect, ranging from 5% to 21.7% of the injected dose per gram of tissue (ID/g). For instance, Biancacci et al. reported tumor accumulation increasing from 7% to 15% ID per g during treatment, 85 while Goos et al. showed exceptionally high uptake of 14.8-21.7% ID per g in tumors with high EPR characteristics. However, the papers also highlighted signi\ue103cant variability in the EPR effect. 86 Lee et al. reported a 35-fold variation in tumor accumulation (0.52-18.5% ID per kg) in clinical studies, indicating high heterogeneity. 87 Nevertheless, it is recognized that the EPR effect's intensity varies based on factors such as tumor type, stage of development, and the heterogeneity of blood vessels. 88 Future research should focus on better understanding and exploiting the EPR effect to improve the efficacy of contrast agents and nanomedicines in cancer imaging and therapy. \n\nThe undermentioned are the factors affecting the efficiency of T 1 contrast agents. \n\n2.3.1.1.",

However, growing evidence suggests that it is over-represented in preclinical models, and agents designed solely using its principle of passive accumulation can only be applied to a narrow subset of clinical tumors. For this reason, strategies that can improve upon the EPR effect to facilitate nanomedicine delivery to otherwise non-responsive tumors are required for broad clinical translation. EPR-adaptive nanomedicine delivery comprises a class of chemical and physical techniques that modify tumor accessibility in an effort to increase agent delivery and therapeutic effect. In the present review, we overview the primary benefits and limitations of radiation, ultrasound, hyperthermia, and photodynamic therapy as physical strategies for EPR-adaptive delivery to EPR-insensitive tumor phenotypes, and we reflect upon changes in the preclinical research pathway that should be implemented in order to optimally validate and develop these delivery strategies.",

This effect arises due to the presence of leaky endothelium in tumor vasculature, resulting in a higher accumulation rate of drug-loaded nanocarriers within the tumor compared to healthy tissues. Additionally, the compromised lymphatic system in tumors contributes to the retention of nanoparticles, and both these phenomena collectively define the EPR effect [10]. Passive targeting offers a significant improvement in specificity, around 20-30%, when compared to healthy organs. The effectiveness of EPR-based passive targeting relies on various factors related to nanocarrier properties, such as size, charge, and surface chemistry, as well as the challenges associated with achieving precise cell targeting within malignant tumors [11,12]. The EPR effect can be further enhanced if smart nanocarriers are able to evade immune surveillance and circulate in the bloodstream for an extended period. This would allow for relatively high concentrations of drug-loaded smart nanocarriers to accumulate at the tumor site within 24-48 h, surpassing the levels observed in normal cells [13].",

            "text": "Enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) in cancer therapy leverages the structural and functional abnormalities of solid tumors [66,67]. Blood vessels in tumors form quickly and poorly as a result of an increased rate of angiogenesis to meet the increased demands for nutrients and oxygen [68]. The newly-formed blood vessels are distorted and the endothelial cells are poorly aligned with large openings [69]. The tumor's vascular wall also exhibits substantial structural abnormalities due to the absence of perivascular cells and smooth muscle layers [68,69]. The tumor's leaky vasculature facilitates the transport of macromolecules and nanoparticles into the tumor tissue while the complementary poor lymphatic drainage prevents clearance of the macromolecules and nanoparticles, leading to their accumulation within the tumor tissue [51,68,70]. Thus, the differences in the blood vessels of tumors and healthy tissues make targeting possible [70,71]. This phenomenon and passive tumor targeting is referred to as the EPR effect [68,69]. \n\nVarious studies have exploited the EPR effect in the delivery of macromolecular therapeutics and nanoformulations; however, the therapeutic effects vary depending on the tumor type, size, origin, and location [72,73]. Blood vessels in pancreatic adenocarcinoma may collapse or become clogged because of the dense stroma (Figure 2) and various extracellular components which induce stress and constriction, affecting the extravasation of macromolecules and particles into tumor tissues [67,[74][75][76]. This may explain why nanotherapeutics have not demonstrated significant efficacy in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. However, other studies have reported that the EPR effect in cancer is not based only on the \"leakiness\" of the vasculature because rigid tumors such as pancreatic adenocarcinoma and prostate cancer exhibit EPR [72,73,77,78].",

            "text": "The enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR) has become an equivocal concept in the targeting and development of anti-cancer nanomedicines. This concept has been recently scrutinized due to disappointing therapeutic efficacy and limited clinical success with anti-cancer nanomedicines compared with excellent results in small animal xenograft models (Anchordoquy et al. 2017;Bjornholm et al. 2017;Moghimi and Farhangrazi 2014;Nel et al. 2017;Park 2013). The complexities and heterogeneity associated with the EPR effect have now been confirmed in high-resolution imaging studies in dogs with primary tumors, but these attempts have yet to resolve nanomedicine transport pathways into tumors as well as their variability within the same tumor mass (Hansen et al. 2015). Two transport pathways for translocation of nanoparticles from the blood circulation into the solid tumors (interendothelial and transendothelial pathways) have been proposed (Bjornholm et al. 2017;Chauhan et al. 2012;Cabral et al. 2011;Dvorak and Feng 2001;Fang and Nakamura 2011;Gerlowski and Jain 1986;Hobbs et al. 1998;Liu et al. 2017;Matsumura and Maeda 1986;Taurin et al. 2012;Yuan et al. 1995). The interendothelial pathway considers nanomedicine extravasation from the blood into tumor interstitium through the pores or open fenestrations in the tumor blood vessels, whereas the latter relies on transcytosis by tumor endothelial cells. What are the evidence supporting these pathways?",

Through accumulation in the tumor vasculature, EPR holds that certain cancer-targeting macromolecules over 40 kDa can deliver such therapeutics to the solid tumor [101]. EPR is dependent on the size and design of the macromolecule therapeutic, position of the vasculature within the tumor as well as its leakiness and the tumor location [102]. The main limitation of EPR is that while tumors grow, the vascular density and the transport between cells is decreased, and therefore, the EPR effect is decreased due to the decreased tumor vasculature accumulation, thus reducing passive delivery of therapeutics [103].",

            "text": "Current anticancer treatments mainly rely on chemotherapy, radiotherapy and/or surgery [102][103][104]. Those treatments, yet effective in many cases, present several drawbacks. In particular, chemotherapy lacks great tumor tissue selectivity, leading to non-specific drug distribution and side effects. In this sense, nanoparticles have emerged as a powerful tool to encapsulate drugs and reduce side effects [105][106][107]. \n\nThe rationale behind the use of nanoparticles in cancer treatment relies on the Enhanced Permeability and Retention effect (EPR effect), which is the basis of some commercialized nanomedicines [108]. The EPR effect, first reported by Maeda and coworkers [109], promotes the passive accumulation of nanoparticles in solid tumors as a result of the hypervasculature, the enhanced permeability and the poor lymphatic drainage found in many tumors (Figure 3). Reproduced from [110] with permission of MDPI, 2015. \n\nOwing to the uncontrolled angiogenesis, the newly formed vessels present an abnormal architecture, including wide fenestrations  nm endothelial cell-cell gaps), irregular vascular alignment or lack of smooth muscle layer, among others. As a result, molecules larger than 40 kDa leak out from them and accumulate in the extravascular tumoral tissues. On the contrary, healthy tissues do not show this abnormal development and no accumulation is observed, thus creating a differential selectivity for cancer tissues [111]. In addition, unlike normal tissues where the extracellular fluid is constantly removed, tumors present defective lymphatic drainage and the accumulated macromolecules tend to remain in the tumoral mass for longer periods of time [112]. \n\nThe magnitude of the EPR effect in humans highly depends on the particularities of the patient and the tumor [113] although some alternative strategies, such as tumor-homing peptides or some types of cells, are currently being explored to overcome the lack of EPR effect. \n\nThese alternative approximations have successfully been evaluated using in vivo tumor models, demonstrating the suitability of using MSNs for tumor drug delivery.",

            "text": "Passive targeting is heavily dependent on the Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) effect. First coined by Matsumura and Maeda in 1986, the EPR effect is a transport phenomenon defined by the existence of fenestrations in the tumor vascular system. The newly emergent vessels in solid tumor tissues continually hyperplasia with a structurally poor vascular wall and substantial spaces, concomitant with defective lymphatic reflux. This EPR effect promotes the high selectivity, permeability, and retention of nanomedicines, sizes ranging from 10 to 200 nm, allowing for preferential distribution in tumor tissues (Figure 3). The effects, along with reducing toxic side effects, enhance the clinical efficiency of drugs (Wu, 2021). However, research performed by Chan et al. revealed insufficient fenestrations or endothelial spaces in the blood vessel wall to facilitate effective extravasation and nanoparticle accumulation within xenograft tumor models and numerous human tumor specimens. Moreover, prolonged blood circulation failed to transport nanomedicines to the tumor site, with the dense extracellular matrix obstructing the complete nanoparticle penetration into the tumor (Pandit et al., 2020). Consequently, only a few drug molecules can target the tumor site while many were accumulated in organs such as the liver, spleen, and kidneys, hindering nanoparticle accumulation in tumors and potentially inducing toxic side effects (Golombek et al., 2018). To enhance passive targeting efficacy, Shi et al. advocated for combining pharmacological and physical treatments, utilizing the ultrasound thermal effect and the nanomedicine's nano-effects to re-engineer the tumor microenvironment. The team also outlined the fundamental principles of nanomedicine-based combined treatments and recent clinical advancements in integrating nanomedicine therapy with photodynamics and immunotherapy (Shi et al., 2020).",

Although techniques to implement the EPR effect on humans are challenging and time consuming [55], it is possible to observe a 25% greater intratumor exposure in patients for docetaxel nanoparticles [56]. However, a recent review declared that this improved accumulation was very heterogeneous and only represented 0.7% of the administered dose, leaving room for optimization [57].

The development of cancer nanomedicine has promised highly effective treatment options unprecedented by standard therapeutics. However, the therapeutic efficacy of passively targeted nanomedicine is not always satisfactory because it is largely influenced by the heterogeneity of the intensity of the EPR effect exhibited within a tumor, at different stages of a tumor, and among individual tumors. In addition, limited data on EPR effectiveness in human hinders further clinical translation of nanomedicine. This unsatisfactory therapeutic outcome in mice and humans necessitates novel approaches to improve the EPR effect. This review focuses on current attempts at overcoming the limitations of traditional EPR-dependent nanomedicine by incorporating supplementary strategies, such as additional molecular targeting, physical alteration, or physiological remodeling of the tumor microenvironment. This review will provide valuable insight to researchers who seek to overcome the limitations of relying on the EPR effect alone in cancer nanomedicine and go \u201cbeyond the EPR effect\u201d.",

            "text": "Tumor vasculature is structurally unique and different from normal vasculature. Tumor tissue also shows highly up-regulated production of vascular effectors. As a consequence extravasation of macromolecules into the interstitial space would occur. The effectors affecting vascular permeability factors includes (brady)kinin, NO, prostaglandins, VEGF (or vascular permeability factor), and CO (by HO-1) in or near the most solid tumors. This enhanced vascular permeability also commonly occurs in inflamed tissue at the sites of infection that is affected by many similar vascular mediators. \n\nOnce macromolecules extravasate from the circulation or blood vessels into the tumor interstitium, they remain in the tumor for a long time without being cleared. This situation is in great contrast to normal tissue, in which macromolecules are cleared via the lymphatic system. Thus, prolonged retention of macromolecules-for more than days to weeks-is a unique characteristic of the EPR effect in tumor tissue.  The EPR effect is applicable to biocompatible macromolecules with MW > 40 KDa. \n\nHowever, the EPR effect occurs frequently heterogeneously, which means that tumor selective macromolecular drug delivery based on the EPR effect may not procede homogeneously. Consequently, drug delivery may be less efficient to metastatic liver cancers and to less vascularized cancers, e.g., cancers of the pancreas and prostate, rendering poor EPR effect. Therefore better therapeutic outcomes for such cancers depends on further augmentation of drug delivery to such tumors. We thus developed measures to enhance the EPR effect. One method involves raising the systemic blood pressure, e.g., from 100 to 160 mmHg by using angiotensin II during arterial infusion of a macromolecular drug, e.g., SMANCS/Lipiodol. This method produced excellent clinical results even in advanced and difficult-to-treat tumors such as metastatic liver cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, and cancers of the pancreas, and others. 88) other method is utilization of NO-releasing agents such as NG for advanced and poor-EPR tumors.",

            "text": "In essence, the EPR effect refers to the phenomenon of selective accumulation of macromolecular agents in tumor tissues, facilitated by the unique anatomical and pathophysiological characteristics of tumor blood vessels. This allows for the preferential permeation and retention of macromolecular drugs within solid tumors following systemic administration. The validity of the EPR effect has been established not only in experimental animal models but also in humans, including cases of liver, renal, and metastatic breast cancers [13][14][15]. Recent studies examining human renal tumors and metastatic breast cancers have demonstrated a significant EPR effect in more than 87% of samples, highlighting the pivotal role of this effect in the advancement of anti-cancer nanomedicines [13,14]. Based on the EPR effect, nanomedicines exhibit many beneficial features for targeted cancer therapy, in contrast to those of conventional small molecular anti-cancer drugs, which tend to spread indiscriminately in normal tissues and organs, thus leading to systemic adverse effects [7,8,10]. Nanomedicines, therefore, offer promise in terms of improved treatment options. In the 1990s, the first polymer-conjugated nanomedicine, SMANCS (styrene maleic acid polymer-conjugated neocarzinostatin), was approved in Japan, marking a significant milestone in the development of anti-cancer nanomedicine [15]. Over the past two decades, the field of anti-cancer nanomedicine has experienced substantial growth and advancement [16][17][18]. Many nanomedicines are currently being utilized in clinical settings, with numerous others undergoing clinical trials (see Table 1). \n\nIn recent years, numerous nanomedicines have been designed and developed for advanced, less-invasive cancer therapy. Examples include nanoprobe-based photodynamic therapy [12,19] and boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) [20,21], as well as magnetic hyperthermia therapy using magnetite [12,19], all of which demonstrate promising therapeutic potential. Additionally, the application of nanomedicine in cutting-edge biomedical fields such as immunotherapy, gene therapy, and preventive medicine has garnered sig-nificant attention.",

            "text": "Soluble macromolecules such as albumin, poly(styreneco-maleic acid-half-n-butylate) conjugated neocarzinostatin (SMANCS) and lipids such as the lipid contrast agent Lipiodol, [1][2][3][4] polymeric drug conjugates, 5) proteins 6) and liposomes 7,8) exhibit enhanced or selective accumulation in solid tumors. This phenomenon has been termed \"the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect\" by Maeda and colleagues [9][10][11] and is attributed to: (i) high vascular density of the tumor, (ii) increased permeability of tumor vessels, (iii) defective tumor vascular architecture, and (iv) defective or suppressed lymphatic drainage in the tumor interstitium. As the EPR effect seems of fundamental importance for tumor-selective targeting using macromolecular anticancer agents, there is considerable need to understand more clearly the mechanism of the EPR effect. \n\nThe use of various proteins with different molecular weights (MWs) 9) and N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (HPMA) copolymers of defined MW 12) administered either to mice, rats, or rabbits, 10,11,13) has shown clearly that there is a relationship between MW and time-dependent tumor accumulation. Molecules of higher MW progressively accumulate in a variety of solid tumor models, the phenomenon being most pronounced when nonbiodegradable polymers are used as probes.  However, it is still not clear whether it is the rate of tumor uptake of macromolecules or their tumor clearance which ultimately governs accumulation with time. \n\nFor this reason, we examined in the present study the early phase tissue uptake (focusing on the period within 10 min after administration) of 125 I-labeled HPMA copolymers of different MW and narrow polydispersity in mice bearing solid tumor. The late phase distribution of HPMA copolymers (>6 h) in tumor and normal tissues was also investigated in this study.",

            "text": "The discovery of the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect in solid tumors has led to the development of a wide range of nanomedicines, including liposomes, for cancer therapy [1]. The EPR effect describes the preferential accumulation of nanoparticles at tumor sites due to leaky vasculature (i.e. enhanced permeation) and impaired lymphatic drainage (i.e. enhanced retention), in comparison to normal tissue. Nano-sized delivery systems have been shown to result in significant increases in tumor accumulation of drugs in comparison to that achieved following administration of free drug [2]. Yet, despite demonstrating substantial accumulation of drug in many pre-clinical and human tumors [2][3][4], clinically approved liposome formulations, such as DoxilH/CaelyxH (pegylated liposomal doxorubicin) and MyocetH (unpegylated liposomal doxorubicin), have only resulted in a modest increase in anti-tumor efficacy relative to the standard of care [5][6][7][8][9]. Major limitations of liposome-based drug delivery are: \n\n(1) variability in the EPR effect and therefore, total tumor accumulation [4]; (2) limited tumor penetration [10]; and (3) slow or limited release of hydrophilic/amphiphilic drugs [11,12]. While it is clear that the poor performance has been linked to a number of factors, one of the most significant is the inability to achieve consistent inter-subject and intra-tumoral accumulation of liposomes [4,10,13,14]. \n\nHeterogeneity in liposome accumulation implies the presence of inter-subject and intra-tumoral variations in the EPR effect.",

            "text": "Cancer nanomedicine was originally developed for more efficient delivery of chemotherapeutic agents into tumor, and has been extensively employed as a therapeutic for cancer treatment owing to its unique features in drug delivery, diagnosis and imaging, as well as the therapeutic nature of some nanomaterials themselves [1,2]. The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect has been considered as the major discipline for development of cancer nanomedicine [3]. By this way, nanomedicines can passively accumulate in tumor due to the large interendothelial gaps and the absence of lymphatic drainage [4,5]. However, the translation of nanomedicine has been limited due to the low clinical effectiveness of EPR effect. According to a retrospective analysis of published studies during 2005-2015, it was founded that only 0.7% of nanoparticle was delivered to solid tumor following systemic administration [6]. Recently, Sindhwani et al. found that the gaps of leaky vessels are not responsible for the penetration into tumor over several different types of tumors [7], as tumor vasculature is mostly continuous, and gaps occur at a very low frequency. It is crucial to explore new strategies to bypass the bottlenecks of traditional nanomedicine delivery. Besides passive accumulation by EPR effect, nanomaterials can integrate novel mechanisms for active tumor-targeted delivery. Taking advantage of molecular markers overexpressing on tumor tissues compared to normal cells, incorporating specific ligands or antibodies should be considered to promote nanoparticle accumulation in solid tumors. Nanomedicine with penetration-assisted peptides or transformable properties, such as reversible charge, have been explored to increase internalization of drugs through active transport [8].",

            "text": "Polymers and supramolecular polymer assemblies such as micelles may take advantage of Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) effect to accumulate in solid tumor tissue. The EPR effect is a property of most solid tumors and means that the tumor filters off and concentrates in tumor tissue large molecules or supramolecular assemblies as micelles or nanoparticles of tens of thousands to millions kDa mass (Maeda 2001(Maeda , 2012(Maeda , 2013)). The accumulation principle is that the endothelium of blood vessels in normal tissue is impermeable for macromolecules, while the fast grown endothelium of neovasculature in solid tumors is generally permeable for macromolecules up to ca 200 nm in diameter depending on the tumor type and animal species (Torchilin 2007, Maeda et al. 2013). Additionally, solid tumors have poor or even completely missing lymphatic drainage, which further hampers elimination of macromolecules from tumor interstitial space. The EPR effect-based targeting may also be effectively combined with ligand-based targeting with ligands to receptors overexpressed on target. \n\nWhile these targeting principles are well-established for nanocarriers of anticancer chemotherapeutics, they may therefore bring also significant benefits to polymer radiopharmaceutics for cancer applications. Despite advances in drug delivery systems in the past two decades, polymer nuclear medicine applications still remain well underestimated compared to more than 100,000 citations to date for delivery systems for chemical drugs (Figure 1). Therefore, the aim of our research was to transfer experience from polymer carriers of chemical drugs to polymer carriers of radionuclides. In this article, we present the most important advances reached in the radiolaboratory at the IMC.",

            "text": "Unlike the above active targeting strategies, passive targeting serves as a basis for developing macromolecular anticancer therapy. The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect plays a vital role in passive targeting, which mainly relies on the anatomical and pathophysiological characteristics of solid tumors and their microenvironments, such as high vascular density in tumor tissue based on angiogenesis, intermittent tumor vasculature with leaky effects and poor drainage of tumor lymphatic system [119,120]. As shown in Fig. 3A, due to the EPR effect, nanoformulations in circulation can enter tumor tissues through the gaps between endothelial cells in tumor blood vessels [121]. This effect further enhances the preferential accumulation of nanocarriers within tumor tissues and accelerates intracellular delivery including endocytosis, lysosomal fusion, escape, cytoplasmic release, and combining the target organelle (Fig. 3B) [46,119,122]. These properties of tumors provide favorable conditions for designing tumor-targeted antitumor NPs. Drug-carrying NPs can increase the accumulation of chemotherapy drugs in tumor tissues through EPR effect, improve therapeutic effects and reduce toxic and side effects by reducing unnecessary release in normal tissues [123,124]. This unique passive targeting effect of nanomaterials on tumor tissue is highly beneficial for developing multifunctional nanoplatforms for TACE therapy of HCC, as it synergically enhances the safety of the transarterial administration and promotes more efficient drug absorption by the tumor.",

Classically, scientists have tried to improve NM delivery by employing passive or active targeting strategies, making use of the so-called enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. This phenomenon is made possible due to the leaky tumor vasculature through which NMs can leave the bloodstream, traverse through the gaps in the endothelial lining of the vessels, and enter the tumor. Recent studies have shown that despite many efforts to employ the EPR effect, this process remains very poor. Furthermore, the role of the EPR effect has been called into question, where it has been suggested that NMs enter the tumor via active mechanisms and not through the endothelial gaps. In this review, we provide a short overview of the EPR and mechanisms to enhance it, after which we focus on alternative delivery strategies that do not solely rely on EPR in itself but can offer interesting pharmacological, physical, and biological solutions for enhanced delivery. We discuss the strengths and shortcomings of these different strategies and suggest combinatorial approaches as the ideal path forward.",

            "text": "Cancer tumors generate an uncommon extracellular matrix, making it challenging for anticancer drugs to infiltrate [1]. In the late 1980s, preferential accumulation of macromolecules into cancer cells was observed. Japanese researchers Hiroshi Maeda and Yasuhiro Matsumura first described the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect in 1986 [2]. This observation was due to the presence of fenestration in damaged tumor blood vessels and poor lymphatic drainage. In hypoxic conditions or inflammation, blood vessels become more permeable. The fast-growing tumor cells in a hypoxic state tend to put in action more blood vessels or submerge existing ones to confront. New blood vessels created due to the process of neovascularization are leaky as they have large fenestrations ranging from 200 to 2000 nm (pore), depending on tumor type, TME (tumor microenvironment), etc. [1]. During the formation of tumors, lymphatic functions are disrupted, resulting in minimal uptake of interstitial fluids, which contributes to the retention of NPs in the tumors as they are not cleared, and stored in the tumor interstitium. This effect is known as the enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) effect. Usually, in normal tissues, the drainage of extracellular fluid into lymphatic vessels often happens at an average flow rate of 0.1 to 2 \u00b5m/s, maintaining continuous drainage and renewal [3]. However, when a tumor is formed, the lymphatic function is disrupted resulting in minimal interstitial fluid uptake [1]. \n\nThe EPR effect is a unique feature of solid tumors related to characteristics of tumors including defective vascular architecture, large space between endothelial cells in blood vessels, abundant vascular mediators, vascular endothelial growth factor, and diminished lymphatic recovery. Therefore, tumor blood vessels are leaky compared to normal blood vessels due to the defective endothelial cells and more vascular permeability, as well as vastly expressed vascular mediators including bradykinin, NO, and VEGF, resulting in selective accumulation of nanodrugs into tumor tissues with little or no distribution in normal cells [4].",

            "text": "Despite various approaches to control solid tumor growth, such as surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and thermotherapy, solid tumors are still the leading cause of death in cancer patients [1]. The need for better clinical outcomes in patients with cancer has led researchers to reconsider therapeutic strategies. To overcome these issues, the structural characteristics of solid tumors, drug nanocarrier transport in tumor vessels and the interstitium, selective drug delivery systems, and analytical tools should be carefully considered to develop cancer therapeutics [2,3]. Although it has long been thought that drug nanocarriers will facilitate cancer therapeutics by directing drugs to solid tumors, nanomedicine development has not yet achieved promising clinical outcomes. Numerous reports indicate that virus-/inorganic nanoparticles-/organic nanoparticles-based nanocarriers could improve the efficacy and safety of anticancer drugs through potential targeting, mitigated drug release in non-target tissues, and pH-sensitive drug release in the tumor microenvironment (TME) [4][5][6][7]. Tumor vascular permeability and the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) mechanism in macromolecular drug delivery to solid tumors have been reported as successful strategies for cancer therapeutics [8][9][10]. However, the low EPR effect in human solid tumors [8], poor tumor extravasation [11] and infiltration [11], and a diversity in the tumor-immune microenvironment (TIME) [12] has resulted in the full realization of EPR-mediated cancer therapeutics [13]. \n\nToday, simulation models have reported the dynamics of tumor vessel cooption and have promoted the treatment of solid tumors [14,15]. However, different results were obtained from different strategies aimed at investigating EPR-mediated drug delivery to cancer cells.",

            "text": "The EPR effect refers to the preferential localization of NNMs in pathological tissues due to the enhanced permeability of the vasculature that supplies such tissues (e.g., tumors and inflammatory conditions). Deregulations in angiogenesis and/or the increased expression and activation of vascular permeability factors predominates at these sites, which can lead to fenestrations allowing passage of NNMs (Hashizume et al., 2000;Nehoff et al., 2014). In addition to the enhanced leakiness of tumorous and inflamed blood vessels, the EPR effect also relates to the observation that solid tumors tend to lack functional lymphatic drainage, which limits the removal of extravasated NNMs from the target site (Maeda et al., 2013;Danhier, 2016). These pathological properties allow NNMs to accumulate at pathological sites and is referred to as passive targeting. To achieve this, it is important that NNMs with drug cargo circulate long enough in the bloodstream (i.e., show prolonged circulation kinetics). This can be achieved by conjugating polyethylene glycol (PEG) to the surface of NNMs (Figure 1). Thus, the EPR effect is expected to increase the therapeutic efficacy of NNMs in comparison to small molecules, which often show inferior pharmacokinetic properties (Matsumura and Maeda, 1986;Hobbs et al., 1998;van der Meel et al., 2013). The EPR effect was first observed in 1986 (Matsumura and Maeda, 1986) and has since been exploited particularly for the development of NNMs for passive tumor targeting, leading to NNMs with adequate physicochemical properties and prolonged circulation half-life that accumulate in tumors over time (Maeda et al., 2013;Nakamura et al., 2015;Danhier, 2016). The EPR effect and thus extent of passive targeting is highly dependent on the tumor pathophysiology. Currently, it is recognized that EPR is a very heterogeneous phenomenon as it depends on the type of tumor and can vary significantly within the same tumor type Ojha et al., 2017).",

            "text": "Employing nanoparticles for the delivery of cancer drugs is a fertile area of research. Low solubility, high toxicity, multi-drug resistance, poor selectivity, and low bioavailability often restrict the use of drugs in treatment or cause detrimental effects. Apart from cancer drug delivery, they are also used in the targeted delivery of anti-microbial and bactericidal compounds. \n\nDrug targeting conventionally has been based on passive targeting. Uncontrolled multiplication of cancerous cells causes nanometre-range lesions leading to a 'leaky' tumor. This gives rise to the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, where either cancer drugs such as doxorubicin and cisplatin, or cytotoxic nanoparticles, accumulate at the 'leak' and cause damage. The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect works as the foundation of anticancer nano-medicine and its design by using various drug formulations. Drug delivery based on the EPR effect is an effective strategy for most solid tumors [49]. The vascular mediators including prostaglandins, bradykinin, and nitric oxide play a vital role in facilitating and maintaining EPR effect dynamics. The advanced stage of cancers may induce activated blood coagulation cascades, which cause thrombus formation in tumor vasculature. The drug delivery, as well as the EPR effect, will be enhanced by restoring obstructed tumor blood flow and improving tumor vascular permeability through vascular mediators. Moreover, the efficiency of the EPR effect depends on the pathophysiological conditions of tumors, drug formulations, and other factors such as the tumor microenvironment. In the physiological location, research on magnetite nanoparticles coupled with lipids reveals a low selectivity for the targeted organ/tissue. However, accumulation in tumor tissues would result from passive targeting, which is facilitated by the ERP effect in tumors via fenestrated arteries (Figure 6) [50]. \n\nJ.

These changes are accompanied by an increase of permeability mediators such as bradykinin, nitric oxide and prostaglandins. A phenomenon observed to be universal in solid tumors is known as the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect for lipid and macromolecular agents. Its principal mechanism is to enhance vascular permeability to maintain adequate supply of nutrients and oxygen for tumor growth. This offers huge opportunities for more selective targeting of lipid-or polymer-conjugated anticancer drugs, such as SMANCS (a conjugate of neocarzinostatin and poly (styrene-co-maleic acid) and PK-1(PK1 is a synthetic N-(2-hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide copolymerdoxorubicin (dox) conjugate) to the tumor. 46,47 Its basic characteristic effects are in areas for the modulation and improvement of the delivery of macromolecular drugs to the tumor. 48,49 e \"EPR effect\" and passage of NPs to the tumor NPs selectively accumulate in tumor tissues by a purely physical phenomenon called EPR effect. At the early stages of tumor development, the lack of blood vessels results in the dependence of the growing tumor on its surrounding tissues for nutrients such as glucose and oxygen. Even then, the tumor core does not receive enough nutrients. This situation stimulates growth of new blood vessels that can carry the required oxygen and nutrients to the tumor for its rapid growth and replication. Because of the rapid growth of the blood capillaries, a process called angiogenesis, the new blood capillaries have a defective vasculature with large number of wide openings between the epithelial cells than healthy blood vessels and lack of the normal basement membrane. The gap size varies depending on the stage of development of the tumor and generally range from a few hundred nanometers to a few microns. In contrast, the pores of normal blood vessels are only 2-6 nm.",

            "text": "The concept for this chemotherapeutic project originated from researchers in the laboratory of the late Professor Alan C. Sartorelli in the Yale Medical School's Department of Pharmacology. Following Professor Sartorelli's death, his laboratory was closed, orphaning this promising project. \n\nThe EPR effect is a verified phenomenon exclusive to solid tumors that has great potential for therapeutic exploitation. The EPR effect arises from the unique architecture of solid tumor capillary networks. Solid tumors, unlike normal tissues, have large gaps between the capillary endothelial cells permitting large scale extravasation and retention of macromolecules (Figure 1), functioning in an analogous manner to a molecular fish trap. EPR effect-based targeting strategies are therefore not influenced by individual tumor cell genetic variability that may confer resistance to molecularly targeted agents. Treatment strategies that efficiently exploit the EPR effect would be of very wide utility, being applicable to most classes of solid tumors. For this approach to function, the cytotoxic activity, once delivered, must remain confined to the tumor. The very short tunable halflives of the 1,2-bis(sulfonyl)-1-alkylhydrazines (BSHs) accomplish this function. The EPR effect has successfully served as a means of improving the tumor selectivity of some clinically used antitumor agents by incorporating them into nanoparticle/macromolecule tumor delivery platforms [1][2][3]. However, the use of approved drugs is likely an extremely poor choice for maximizing tumor selectivity in most cases. This is because their success as 'free-agents' is due in part to pharmacokinetic properties favoring good distribution and tissue penetration, and these very same properties will also aid in the escape and redistribution of a formerly targeted agent. Thus, leakage and redistribution of tumor-targeted material to normal tissues is a major, and commonly occurring problem, with targeted drugs. Other major concerns include: the inefficient release of the targeted agent, inappropriate systemic activation, high sensitivity of normal tissues to the targeted agent, and non-benign delivery platform residual products.",

            "text": "Furthermore, angiogenesis and vascular remodeling in normal tissues follow the law of diameter reduction in smaller branches, which is not seen in solid tumors [39]. Therefore, the heterogeneity of solid tumor microvascular networks could result in alterations in vascular permeability and interstitial fluid flow, which act as key biological barriers to cancer drug delivery and efficacy in solid tumors. The overgrowth of solid tumors and a fibrotic response with increased ECM deposition lead to the introduction of mechanical barriers, resulting in altered interstitial fluid flows [40,41]. Heterogeneity of vascular fluid flow due to physical barriers due to increased cell proliferation in some solid tumor areas can reduce the efficiency of drug nanocarriers, especially in dimensions larger than 100 nm, intratumoral transport, and the EPR effect [20,41]. \n\nRegardless of the stages of vascular formation in solid tumors, which have been studied by Fang et al. [42], exploring the molecular characteristics of tumor vessels can provide a more accurate understanding of the active or inactive delivery of drug nanocarriers. Unlike normal vascular architecture with a homogeneous distribution of endothelial cells surrounded by pericytes, the heterogeneous vasculature of a solid tumor results in different permeability models [43]. This morphological abnormality not only provides greater vascular permeability in solid tumors but also leads to increased interstitial pressure in the tumor tissue, which generates multiple distribution patterns of drug nanocarriers [44]. It seems that determining the balance between vascular resistance and vascular leakage of solid tumors can be used as a basis for drug delivery mediated by the EPR effect to increase therapeutic efficacy in interstitial fluid. Basically, momentary changes in fluid flow with vascular resistance, and vascular leakage with vascular wall pore diameters ranging from 50-100 nm (tumor vessels with poor permeability) to 500-1000 nm (high permeability vessels) are explained. Overall, the EPR effect is expected to be more effective during the early phases of cancer growth or peritumors than late phases due to improved leakage behavior and the rate of fluid flow. This result could advance future therapeutics for solid tumors with a different approach.",

This is because, on the one hand, the vascular system of tumor tissues, compared to that of normal tissues, is structurally abnormal and more \"leaky, \" allowing these abnormal vessels to have larger gaps, which enables nanoscale drug delivery systems to pass through the vascular wall into tumor tissues more easily; on the other hand, compared to normal tissues, tumor tissues lack an effective lymphatic drainage system, meaning that once the drug delivery systems penetrate the vascular wall into the tumor tissues, they are more difficult to clear [142]. As a result, the concentration of these nanoscale drug delivery systems in tumor tissues increases, and their retention time prolongs, thereby enhancing the therapeutic effect of the drugs on tumor cells.",

A typical experimental result (Figure 3) showed a maximum enhancement in the T1w RARE MR signal of ~34%, which rose from zero at time zero and peaked at 6.36 min post-injection (n = 4 tumor-bearing mice per experiment). When the data (Figure 3 Perls' staining of control tumors removed prior to SPION injection (Figure 2A) showed an absence of widespread iron, while staining of tumors 24 h after SPION IV (5 mg/kg) administration (Figure 2B) showed significant iron uptake. Counts of Perls' positive cells (See Section 2) in the control tumors indicated that about 0.4% of the cells stained for iron, while in tumor tissue removed from mice post-ferumoxytol injection we found that ~25% of the cells were Fe+.

            "text": "Passive targeting therapeutic strategies rely heavily on EPR effects that describe the distribution and fate of delivered nanoparticles on major tumors (>1 cm 3 ) when associated with a circulatory system that is very porous or \"leaky\" [76]. Most current target treatments are passive [77]. Under EPR effects, the vascular endothelium is more permeable than in a healthy state, and hypoxia with mild acidity is characteristic of the TME. Due to their rapid expansion, tumors need to form new blood vessels to get nutrients and oxygen to ensure that the tumor grows exponentially. The tumor mesenchyme is selectively breached by improved penetration of macromolecules and NCs larger than 40 kDa, through the recently generated leaky capillaries. Consequently, nanoscale drug carriers tend to accumulate in the tumor and target site due to their reduced propensity to diffuse into healthy normal tissue, attributed to the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect and specific interactions with tumor cells. \n\nMany encouraging results have been seen using this therapeutic approach, including enhanced concentration of the medications at the target sites and less toxicity in healthy tissue. Numerous passive targeting NCs, including liposomes, micelles, albumin-coated nanoparticles, and polymeric nanoparticles, have been authorized for use in the treatment of various tumors over the past 20 years. However, reliance solely on the EPR effect limits the possible selectivity. Notably, recent studies have questioned the entry mechanism of NCs into solid tumors. Sindhwani et al. [78] explored NCs tumor penetration, finding evidence that transcytosis may be the main mechanism of NCs enrichment at tumor sites. The endothelial cell space, long considered a key factor in the EPR effect, was found to be less frequent. Among 313 blood vessels in all tumor models, only 26 gaps were detected, with a total gap coverage of 0.048 % of the vessel surface area and the number of interendothelial spaces 60 times less than the accumulated NCs. This partially supports the EPR effect but fails to fully explain the accumulation of NCs. In the past 30 years, NCs have multiplied and become more complex.",

            "text": "Targeting. The phenomenon of Enhanced Permeation and Retention (EPR) effect describes the property of malignant tissue to permit vesicles of proper size to traverse through their vessel walls and enter the tumoral site. Pathological tissues, such as inflammatory or solid tumour tissues, are described by an increased vascular permeability [30,42]. More particularly, solid tumours that undergo angiogenesis develop discontinuous endothelium. Onto it, large fenestrations allow molecules of up to approximately 4000 kDa or 500 nm to enter the interstitial space. SSLs fulfil the size requirements needed to permeate the tumor vessels and gather in the desired tissue. This phenomenon is called passive targeting and involves the extravasation of liposomes on account for their mechanical and physical properties. More importantly, once liposomes have entered the tumoral tissue, its malfunctioning lymphatic system is incapable of removing them, so they are accumulated in this area, granting time to the encapsulated liposomal load to exert its therapeutic effect [4].",

As a model, radioiodinated N\u2010(2\u2010hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (HPMA) copolymers of MW ranging from 4.5 K to 800 K were administered i.v. to mice bearing sarcoma 180 tumor. Within 10 min all HPMA copolymers accumulated effectively in the tumor regardless of MW (1.0\u20131.5% of injected dose per g of tumor). However, higher MW copolymers (>50 K) showed significantly increased tumor accumulation after 6 h, while the lower MW copolymers (<40 K) were cleared rapidly from tumor tissue due to rapid diffusion back into the bloodstream. Blood clearance was also MW\u2010dependent; the lower MW copolymers displayed rapid clearance, with kidney radioactivity of the copolymers of MW <20 K representing 24% of injected dose per g kidney at 1 min after i.v. administration. Within 10 min these copolymers passed through the kidney and were excreted in the urine. Higher MW copolymers consistently showed kidney levels of 3\u20135% dose per g kidney in the early phase with no time\u2010dependent accumulation in kidney. There was also no progressive accumulation in muscle or liver, regardless of polymer MW. These results suggest the \u201cEPR effect\u201d in solid tumor primarily arises from in the difference in clearance rate between the solid tumor and the normal tissues after initial penetration of the polymers into these tissues.",

            "text": "In contrast to most normal tissues, tumor tissues are rich in new capillaries, and the endothelial layer of the capillaries is fenestrated and leaky; thus, macromolecules and other nanoparticles can reach the malignant tissue. Tumor tissue generally has a defective lymphatic drainage system, resulting in the retention and subsequent accumulation of macromolecules in solid tumors. Due to the EPR effect, compared with HPT, dHPG-HPT can passively accumulate in SACC xenografts and is sustained for a long period of time, which significantly reduces the volume of lung metastases in nude mice and confers a better treatment effect. \n\nVEGF also plays an important role in angiogenesis (14-16) through the promotion of chemotaxis and mitosis of vascular endothelial cells via the targeting of the specific receptors VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, which promotes the growth of tumor tissues. In addition, VEGF enhances the vascular permeability of normal blood vessels and tumor vessels (17,18). Thus, VEGF is one of the critical factors that has an impact on the EPR effect. In the present study, the expression of VEGF in the control group was high, indicating that SACC xenografts were in a rapid growth phase; this potentially provides a good condition for the EPR effect. In the dHPG-HPT group, the expression of VEGF was low, and the tumor volumes were smaller than in the HPT group (Fig. 3), which suggests that the growth of SACC xenografts was inhibited in the dHPG-HPT group. Due to the EPR effect, dHPG-HPT has a passive targeting effect on tumor tissue and a better inhibitory effect on the growth of tumor tissue; thus, the expression of VEGF in the dHPG-HPT group was reduced. \n\nIn 1992, Weidner et al (9) reported on MVD, which was used to quantify the amount of new blood vessels in tumors.",

Fast-growing tumors develop poorly organized vasculature with large endothelial fenestrations that allows NPs to accumulate in the tumor interstitium. Tumors also have impaired lymphatic drainage that enhances NP retention in the tumor [88,89]. Although the EPR effect has served as the foundation for most cancer nanomedicines, there is heterogeneity in its presentation based on tumor type and patient population. Furthermore, the size of a tumor and the heterogeneous tumor microenvironment affect the EPR effect [90]. The existence of the EPR effect in metastasis is an unresolved question, with studies reporting that metastases exhibit the phenomenon [91], while others report otherwise, especially in early-stage metastasis [92]. \n\nTargeting of therapeutics to bone metastases or any other tissue can utilize the unique physical characteristics of the tissue (passive targeting) to improve drug delivery. In the bone, passive targeting takes advantage of the fenestrations in bone-marrow capillaries. Active targeting exploits specific receptors upregulated on bone-marrow endothelial cells or specific interactions with the bone matrix to improve drug delivery. In this section, we discuss the different methods of targeting, the ligands used, and the NPs utilized (Table 3).",

            "text": "Cancer remains one of the most devastating diseases, with 18.1 million new cases and 9.6 million deaths worldwide in 2018 alone [1]. Currently, first-line cancer treatment regimens include one or more modalities, such as surgery, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, and chemotherapy. Therefore, imaging/therapeutic/theranostic agent delivery remains an important issue in cancer management. Generally, these agents can be passively distributed to target cancer cells in tumors, and passive targeting relies mostly on the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect derived from the leaky nature of tumor vasculature [2]. The basic pathophysiological phenomenon of EPR is hyperpermeable tumor vasculature combined with impaired lymphatic drainage, resulting in enhanced permeability and retention of molecules [3,4]. Although the conventional EPR effect results in improved delivery to tumors compared with normal tissue, some tumors do not exhibit the EPR effect and the permeability of vessels may not be the same throughout a single tumor [5,6]. Moreover, the rapid proliferation of cancer cells around the vessels may impede therapeu-tic molecule penetration [7]. Therefore, the killing of perivascular cancer cells will help improve the EPR effect. Treatments that induce apoptosis or necrosis in perivascular tumor sheaths can enhance the delivery of therapeutic molecules to solid tumors [8]. Several approaches are being explored to enhance vascular permeability and augment drug delivery within tumors, such as radiotherapy [9,10], hyperthermia [11], and photoimmunotherapy (PIT) [12]. \n\nRecently, PIT using a photosensitizer-conjugated antibody against tumor-associated antigens accompanied with exposure to light of a specific wavelength has been attracting attention as a new type of therapeutic modality for cancer [12,13]. The photosensitizerantibody conjugates strongly bind to cells in the immediate perivascular space, and thus PIT rapidly induces necrotic cell death, especially in the perivascular space, leading to a dramatic increase in tumor vascular permeability.",

Taking advantage of the EPR effect, PLGA-PEG (si-cSERPINE2) NPs achieved high concentrations in breast cancer xenografts in vivo. Moreover, the results from breast orthotopic and lung metastatic models showed that this si-cSERPINE2-NPs system prominently reduced tumor burden and lung metastatic formation. Additionally, the results from H&E histopathological analysis and blood biochemical examination confirmed si-cSERPINE2-NPs had not significant toxic side effects.

            "text": "The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect is historically one of the most frequently cited advantages of nanoparticle cancer therapeutics [37]. As tumorigenesis occurs, the secretion of pro-angiogenic factors such as vascular epidermal growth factor (VEGF) induces the formation of a disordered, complex vascular network feeding tumor cells as they proliferate. High expression of VEGF in tumor tissue has been implicated in the formation of abnormal vascular wall morphology, where the endothelium lining the blood vessels contains large gaps-or \"leaky\" junctions-allowing for enhanced permeability of small particles and cells across the vascular wall. It is this enhanced permeability that is a double-edged sword for cancer: on the one hand, it is believed to enhance tumor metastasis by allowing the escape of tumor cells into the infiltrating vessels, which circulate them across the body to distant metastatic sites [38]; on the other hand, the leaky vasculature unique to the tumor microenvironment promotes the accumulation of systemically circulating nanoparticles at the tumor site, a phenomenon that should enhance the therapeutic efficacy of nanoparticle drugs against solid tumors. Despite the premise of the EPR effect to preferentially enhance the uptake of nanoparticles in tumors, the challenges we have outlined above clearly indicate there remains significant room for improving nanoparticle delivery. Uptake into tumor tissue via the Cellular internalization of nanoparticles is achieved either passively or actively, although the lines between these two methods of internalization have been somewhat blurred as researchers continue to develop new methods of characterizing and enhancing nanoparticle uptake by tumor cells. Santi\u00e0 et al. reviewed various methods of nanoparticle surface functionalization and found that methods such as PEGylation enhance the passive internalization of nanoparticles [36]. Analytical methods such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM) have been used to visualize accumulation of passively internalized nanoparticles in endosomes, and continued functionalization of nanoparticle coronas with ligands such as cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) have further enhanced nanoparticle uptake into tumor cells.",

            "text": "Solid tumors are characterized by highly selective permeability and the retention of macromolecular substances and lipid particles, and collectively, these outcomes are referred to as the EPR effect [56,57]. EPR is spontaneously derived through particular anatomical and pathophysiological characteristics of solid tumors, such as an immature and abnormal vascular structure, an impaired lymphatic function and abundant levels of vascular mediators, including bradykinin, nitric oxide, prostaglandins, proinflammatory cytokines, and interleukins [56]. Recently, several tactics have been applied to augment the EPR effect, and one of these strategies involves enhancing angiogenesis by administering angiogenic drugs [57]. Inspired by the strategy of vascular promotion, the induction of extensive angiogenesis after IRFA seems to be a suitable approach for promoting the EPR effect and nanodrug enrichment. To test our hypothesis, a unilateral IRFA tumor model was constructed, and we confirmed that ICG@ZIF-8 NPs were further enriched in residual cancer after IRFA (Fig. 5E, F). In addition to increasing angiogenesis, several other subtle IRFAinduced changes in the tumor microenvironment may facilitate the enrichment of nanocarriers in tumors. First, previous studies have shown that IRFA can increase the infiltration of leukocytes, which produce nitric oxide and thus subsequently increase vascular permeability [2,4]. Second, some proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and interleukins) and matrix metalloproteinases can be activated after IRFA and promote vascular permeability through direct or indirect pathways [2]. Third, the hyperthermia caused by RFA may damage the tumor lymphatic vessels, and this eventually results in the prolonged retention of NPs at tumor sites. Considering the results of these analyses, we propose that residual cancer after IRFA may provide a natural anatomical and pathophysiological basis for enhancing the EPR effect. \n\nEncouraged by the augmented EPR effect observed in residual tumors post IRFA, we prepared ATO-loaded ZIF-8 NPs and explored their biosafety and therapeutic outcomes.",

Therefore, nanoparticles can exit the circulation and penetrate the tumor interstitial space [3]. Furthermore, lymphatic filtration is poor within tumors, which facilitates drug accumulation [3]. Thus, the high permeability and increased retention processes lead to the accumulation of nanoparticles in solid tumors and to the release of therapeutic agents into malignant cells [3,7,8].

            "text": "Maeda and Matsumura reported that proteins and nanoparticles can accumulate in the tumor environment due to the leaky neovascular system and immature lymphatic system-the so-called enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect [60,61]. However, several barriers associated with the tumor microenvironment, including abnormal vasculature, high interstitial fluid pressure, tumor-cell density, and abnormal stromal matrix, limit the EPR effect and/or inhibit the permeability of nano-drugs in the cancer tissues [77,78]. Therefore, modulating the blood flow and vasculature at the tumor site is one of the key factors for the improvement of the EPR effect. As described above, the co-delivery of the NO donor with anticancer drugs significantly enhances the efficacy of cancer treatment via the MDR inhibitory effect of NO, including the inhibition of P-gp expression and HIF-1 activation. \n\nAnother important characteristic of the NO molecule is \"angiogenesis\", which increases the tumoral blood flow and vascular dilation as described above. NO-triggered improvement of the angiogenesis of the tumor environment was studied in order to enhance the EPR effect [79]. Maeda and co-workers reported that several NO generators-such as nitroglycerin, hydroxyurea, and L-Arg-significantly enhanced tumor accumulation of the tested nanomedicines in a mouse model of implanted colon cancer and sarcoma [80]. It is interesting to note that there was no increase in nanoparticle accumulation in the other normal tissues. This is probably due to the difference in vascular structures between intra-tumoral and normal tissue regions. Weidensteiner et al. applied the NO donor JS-K [O(2)-(2,4-dinitrophenyl) 1-[(4-ethoxycarbonyl)piperazin-1-yl]diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate] to a cerebral blood vessel.",

            "text": "Given the plasticity of the TME, it is advantageous to exploit EVs as a therapeutic approach to fight cancer. This can occur in a few different ways including using EVs as a drug delivery system to directly target tumors or as a method of remodeling the TME. This therapeutic avenue is largely attractive due to the biological nature of EVs, conferring stable bioavailability as well as distribution in vivo, and EVs can carry a diverse range of different cargo (Kang et al., 2021). In addition to this, solid cancers can exhibit a phenomenon known as the enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR), which describes increased accumulation of nanoparticles in tumors compared to regular tissues. As EVs are a type of nanoparticle, it is plausible that they may be subject to EPR (Phillips et al., 2021). EPR is observed in various solid tumors, and is characterized by abnormal tumor vasculature, tumor permeability, and a lack of effective lymphatic drainage (Wu, 2021). The leaky tumor vasculature allows for nanoparticles to extravasate through surrounding blood vessels (Maeda et al., 2013). Together, these function to help nanoparticles persist and accumulate in tumors, allowing for retention and direct delivery to the site of interest (Wu, 2021). These characteristics make EVs an attractive therapeutic avenue that can be adapted to different treatment approaches.",

However, only a small fraction of an intravenously administered anti\u2010cancer drug enters the lymphatic system to reach metastatic lymph nodes (LN). Here, we show that the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect is not induced during the early stages of LN metastasis. Luciferase\u2010expressing tumor cells were injected into the subiliac LN of the MXH10/Mo\u2010lpr/lpr mouse to induce metastasis to the proper axillary LN (PALN). In vivo biofluorescence imaging was used to confirm metastasis induction and to quantify the EPR effect, measured as PALN accumulation of intravenously injected indocyanine green (ICG) liposomes. PALN blood vessel volume changes were measured by contrast\u2010enhanced high\u2010frequency ultrasound imaging. The volume and density of blood vessels in the PALN increased until day 29 after inoculation, whereas the LN volume remained constant. ICG retention was first detected on day 29 post\u2010inoculation. While CD31\u2010positive cells increased up to day 29 post\u2010inoculation, \u03b1\u2010smooth muscle actin\u2010positive cells were detected on day 29 post\u2010inoculation for the first time. These results suggest that the EPR effect was not induced in the early stages of LN metastasis; therefore, systemic chemotherapy would likely not be beneficial during the early stages of LN metastasis. The development of an alternative drug delivery system, independent of the EPR effect, is required for the treatment of LN metastasis.",

            "text": "Enhanced permeability and Retention (EPR) effect, first introduced in 1986 by Matsumura and Maeda, has been increasingly studied over time. Pathophysiological characteristics of EPR vary substantially with tumorous and healthy tissues of a patient. It has been realized that the EPR effect is heterogeneous and changes with the progression of tumor (Golombek et al. 2018;Sindhwani et al. 2020). It has been recognized as an important platform for NP delivery to solid tumors. Low MW drugs are easily extravagant out of the blood vessels and accumulate in the healthy tissues, while, on the other hand, abnormal wide fenestrations in tumor results in retention of nanodrugs, up to several hundred nanometers in size, at the pathological sites. This, along with lack of lymphatic drainage, limits the accumulation of NPs in tumors (Fig. 3). As a consequence, clinical outcomes of nanoparticles fluctuate (Rosenblum et al. 2018;Sindhwani et al. 2020).\n\nTo translate the NPs from clinical research successfully to clinical application, and facilitate personalized cancer therapy, it is important that efficient passive targeting NPs should be designed, which can selectively target the tumor cells through EPR (Yao et al. 2020;Zhao et al. 2016). A combined effect of pharmacological and physical (hyperthermia and radiotherapy) approaches can be employed to enhance the accumulation of EPRbased nanocarriers in the tumor tissue, and thus increase the treatment efficacy. Researchers have attempted to combine the drug carriers with functionalized physical, biological or chemical ligands to improve passive and active targeting strategies (Nguyen et al. 2021). Daunoxome, Marqibo, Onivyde, Genexol-PM, CPX-1, AZD2811 and EndoTAG-1 are few examples of passively targeted NPs currently used clinically with a better pharmacokinetic profile (Wilhelm et al. 2016). Currently, a liposome encapsulated Doxorubicin (C225-ILS-DOX) was formulated (Table 2), where delivery efficacy was further increased by attaching antibody fragments to its surface.

            "text": "Drug targeting strives for selective and effective localization of the active drug at the specific target organ, tissue, or cell where a specific pharmacological impact is required while restricting its access to untargeted normal cells, thus minimizing toxic effects. The main mechanism of tumor targeting of anticancer nanomedicines is based on the Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) effect, first described by Matsumura and Maeda in 1986 [112] as a passive yet powerful targeting strategy. They showed that tumor tissues had defective blood vessels with aberrant branching and large openings between endothelial cells of around 400 nm due to their rapid proliferation and decreased number of pericytes. This unique characteristic helps macromolecules, such as nanocarriers, easily move into tumor tissues after crossing the endothelium barrier. Furthermore, solid tumors have a poor lymphatic drainage system, leading to extended retention times of nanocarriers in the tumor extracellular matrix. \n\nAlthough the EPR effect has allowed the successful development of some anticancer nanomedicines with a passive tumor-targeting mechanism [99], many well-designed drug delivery systems fail when tested in patients. Over the last years, the role of the EPR effect has been investigated, focusing on the influence of the TME, heterogeneity of human tumors, and differences between animal models and actual patients [104,113,114]. These factors may contribute to the observed limited penetration of nanomedicines in human tumors, highlighting the need for further refinement of passive targeting strategies.",

            "text": "The discovery of the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect has resulted in the development of nanomedicines, including liposome-based formulations of drugs, as cancer therapies. The use of liposomes has resulted in substantial increases in accumulation of drugs in solid tumors; yet, significant improvements in therapeutic efficacy have yet to be achieved. Imaging of the tumor accumulation of liposomes has revealed that this poor or variable performance is in part due to heterogeneous inter-subject and intra-tumoral liposome accumulation, which occurs as a result of an abnormal transport microenvironment. A mathematical model that relates liposome accumulation to the underlying transport properties in solid tumors could provide insight into inter and intra-tumoral variations in the EPR effect. In this paper, we present a theoretical framework to describe liposome transport in solid tumors. The mathematical model is based on biophysical transport equations that describe pressure driven fluid flow across blood vessels and through the tumor interstitium. The model was validated by direct comparison with computed tomography measurements of tumor accumulation of liposomes in three preclinical tumor models. The mathematical model was fit to liposome accumulation curves producing predictions of transport parameters that reflect the tumor microenvironment. Notably, all fits had a high coefficient of determination and predictions of interstitial fluid pressure agreed with previously published independent measurements made in the same tumor type. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the model attributed inter-subject heterogeneity in liposome accumulation to variations in peak interstitial fluid pressure. These findings highlight the relationship between transvascular and interstitial flow dynamics and variations in the EPR effect. In conclusion, we have presented a theoretical framework that predicts inter-subject and intra-tumoral variations in the EPR effect based on fundamental properties of the tumor microenvironment and forms the basis for transport modeling of liposome drug delivery.",

            "text": "Most solid tumors possess unique pathophysiological characteristics that are absent in normal tissues, such as extensive and unregulated angiogenesis, defective vascular architecture, enhanced vascular permeability, dysfunctional lymphatic drainage and increased production of a number of permeability mediators (Gabizon et al., 2006;Maeda et al., 2000).This enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR) inherent to solid tumors (Fig. 6) (Maeda et al., 2000;Drummond et al., 1999) has been described in several experimental tumors and depends mainly on tumor volume, vascularization and leakage from blood vessels (Gabizon et al., 2006;Yuan et al., 1995).Long-circulating liposomal drug formulations with size diameter within the range of 100-150 nm demonstrate preferential extravasation through leaky tumor vasculature and passively accumulate in the interstitial space due to the EPR effect.The release of drug molecules from liposomes into the tumor interstitium provides locally drug delivery at therapeutic dose levels (Abraham et al., 2005;Drummond et al., 1999;Gabizon & Papahadjopoulos, 1988).Interestingly, a particular study on tumor xenograft animal models reported that liposomes up to 400 nm can extravasate across tumor vessels and penetrate into tumor interstitium, suggesting that the threshold vesicle size of the pores is generally between 400 and 600 nm in diameter (Yuan et al., 1995).Nevertheless it is important to emphasize that the cut-off range mostly depends on tumor type.The extent of accumulation within the tumor is largely determined by the circulation lifetime of the liposomes (Song et al., 2006).Moreover, the impaired lymphatic drainage in the tumor interstitium favors the retention of liposomal formulations at the extravasation site, accentuating the passive targeting to solid tumors (Fig. 5) (Gabizon et al., 2006;Maeda et al., 2000;Drummond et al., 1999).\n\nFig. 6.Enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR).Liposomes are shown as representative nanoparticles.",

            "text": "Passive targeting (Figure 5) exploits the peculiar anatomical and pathological abnormalities of the tumor vasculature which promote the accumulation of polymeric nanoparticles in the perivascular tumor region by convection or passive diffusion (Bazak et al., 2014). Convection refers to the movement of large molecules across large pores. Contrarily, diffusion is defined as a process of molecular transport across the cell membrane along the concentration gradient without consumption of cellular energy and applies mostly to compounds with a low molecular weight. However, diffusion is a more important mechanism of drug accumulation in a tumor mass because convection through the interstitium is poor; the high interstitial pressure of a tumor microenvironment does not allow the convection of drugs. The excessive leakiness of tumor vasculature, characterized by large fenestrations with a mean diameter of 100-800 nm, promotes the localization of nanoparticles into the interstitial space as a consequence of the \"enhanced permeability\" effect. At the same time, inefficient drainage of the tumor tissue due to the absence or ineffectiveness of lymphatic vessels results in \"enhanced retention\" of nanoparticles. Together, these two phenomena are known as the \"Enhanced Permeability and Retention\" (EPR) effect. The EPR effect is the cornerstone in nanoparticle-mediated drug delivery in cancers, especially in solid tumors which are characterized by rapid growth, with the exception of hypovascular tumors such as prostate or pancreatic cancer (Danhier et al., 2012). The size of a nanoparticle impacts the overall manifestation of the EPR effect on nanoparticle accumulation in tumor tissue. Polymeric nanoparticles, micelles, liposomes, and dendrimers of 80-150 nm are retained in the solid tumor tissue, but smaller particles (<20-30 nm) can easily diffuse into other compartments. Therefore, small nanoparticles exhibit poor retention even when they have good permeability (Wang et al., 2010). \n\nThe anti-tumor efficacy of many clinically available nanoformulations (Doxil, Caelyx, and Abraxane) can be partially explained on the basis of the passive targeting of the EPR effect.",

The microvascular endothelium in normal tissues is dense and structurally intact such that macromolecules and lipid particles cannot easily penetrate the vessel wall, while solid tumor tissue has wide gaps in the blood vessel wall, incomplete structure, and lack of lymphatic re\ue104ux, resulting in selective high permeability and retention of macromolecular substances and lipid particles. The nanocarrier macromolecules were concentrated in the tumor region through the EPR effect in a passively dispersed manner, where they played a passive targeting role.\n\nIn addition, although the EPR takes effect relatively slowly, while nanocarriers enter the tumor site, it is rigorously maintained over time and regardless of concentration. 17 Under the dual targeting effects of magnetic attraction and EPR, the intracellular \ue104uorescence intensity of the magnetic targeting group was higher than that of the nonmagnetic targeting group. These results indicate that magnetic targeting is conducive to the accumulation of magnetic NPs in the direction of tumors, making them potential therapeutic reserve forces for prospective combination therapies of tumors.",

            "text": "The EPR mechanism was initially described for non-brain solid tumors in 1986 (142,143). This mechanism is based on four main components: (1) hypervascularization of the tumor, (2) enhanced permeability of tumor vasculature, (3) hampered absorption of macromolecules back into the vasculature, and (4) reduced drainage of molecules through the lymphatic system. Because the BBTB in high-grade gliomas is even more permeable than fenestrated non-brain capillaries, many optical guidance drugs reach the tumor via this mechanism. Furthermore, the lack of a lymphatic system in tumors prevents the clearance of large molecules and lipids from the interstitial space, greatly contributing to drug retention (142,143). It is worth noting that some tumors do not have increased vascularity, and therefore the EPR effect is not observed in them. For example, metastatic prostate and liver cancers have low vascular densities (144,145). This low vascular density potentially explains the lack of FLS-, ICG-, and 5-ALA-labeling of some brain metastases. \n\nIn order for the EPR effect to occur, the injected molecule should be biocompatible, have no clearance by the reticuloendothelial system, and be non-reactive to blood cells or the endothelium (142). The molecule should be large enough (>40 kDa) to avoid renal clearance through the pores in glomerular endothelium and have a weakly negative or neutral surface charge (142,146). With respect to the upper limit of size of a molecule for EPR, researchers have demonstrated that 1-\u00b5m diameter Lactobacilli can be selectively delivered into the tumor with additional dilation of the tumor endothelial cell junctions by an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (147). Many drugs, including polymer conjugates, bind to albumin (60 kDa), increasing their molecular weight, thus satisfying the criteria for EPR delivery.",

            "text": "One of the arguments for the EPR effect concerns the roles of interstitial fluid pressure [23,24] and solid stress [25] in solid tumor tissue.The interstitial fluid pressure and solid stress exist due to the expansion of the tumor mass against surrounding normal tissue.Different from interstitial fluid pressure, the solid stress in tumors is considered to be residual stress that compresses blood vessels in tumor tissues, causing hypoxia and impeding drug delivery [26].It is believed that interstitial fluid pressure and solid stress are the major obstacles preventing efficient delivery of macromolecules into tumor tissue [27].However, we have seen tremendous evidence that macromolecules do accumulate in both rodent and human solid tumor tissues in size-dependent and time-dependent manners.Interstitial fluid pressure or solid stress hinders drug penetration into the center of tumor tissue, but it does not prevent the macromolecular agents from extravasating and accumulating in the peripheral area of tumor tissue.The EPR effect occurs primarily in the peritumoral area [28].Interstitial fluid pressure and solid stress provide the mechanism for the retention effect because under such pressure or stress the formation of functional lymphatic vessels is prevented due to their collapse from the pressure [22].The interstitial fluid pressure and heterogeneous blood supply are both observed in rodent and human solid tumors; therefore, these are not valid reasons for rebuttals that assume the EPR effect won't function in human solid tumor tissue.\n\nIt is critical to understand and remember that the peripheral highly vascularized area is the most vigorously growing zone of tumors.The center of tumor tissues lacks blood flow and is necrotic or seminecrotic [28].When suppressing the growing activities in peritumoral zones, tumors are restricted or eliminated.It is not necessary for an anticancer drug to penetrate into the center of a solid tumor to execute anticancer activities.For example, trastuzumab (Herceptin) is an antibody that is successful in treating Her2 positive breast cancer growth, and penetrates only into the vascularized area [29].\n\nThere are limited examples of successful nanomedicine treatments in cancer therapy.",

The tumor environment is variable and certain characteristics may hinder the EPR effect, such as hypovascularity, fibrosis, and necrosis. 10 Furthermore, infiltrating cancer cells and small metastatic seeds may be protected by the BBB in surrounding intact tissue. 4 Even with the breakdown of the BBB in neuro-oncological disease, the fact remains that the tissue accumulation of chemotherapeutics for CNS metastases is 85% less intracranially compared with penetration and biodistribution for extracranial neoplasms. 9 The limited efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs has been attributed to an inability to achieve effective therapeutic concentrations of these drugs in the tumor due to the presence of the BBB. With limited penetrative treatments efficacious at targeting CNS tumors and the gravity of neuro-oncological disease, it is imperative to continue exploring promising advancements in treatment options. To improve their targeting and concentration in the CNS, chemotherapeutic drugs have to respect a list of specific criteria.

            "text": "Due to abnormal morphology and function of tumor neovascularization, that is, poor arrangement of endothelial cells, lack of smooth muscle layer, impaired angiotensin ii receptor function, and insufficient lymphatic drainage within the tumor, macromolecule drugs and nanoparticles will be retained in the tumor site once they enter. This phenomenon is called the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. Utilizing the EPR effect, targeted nanocarriers such as liposomes and nanoparticles are expected to deliver more drugs to tumors. However, the literature has revealed that only approximately .7% of nanomaterials reach solid tumors after systematic administration. Although the traditional EPR effect can increase the delivery of nanomedicine to the site of the tumor, it is far from achieving a tumor therapeutic effect. After intravenous administration of an antibody-photon absorber conjugate (APC), the antibody conjugate can bind to tumor cells in the perivascular space to the maximum extent. 47 xposure to NIR light induces toxic effects on these cells, resulting in sudden perivascular cell necrosis and loss of vascular integrity. Blood vessels dilate due to decreased interstitial hydraulic pressure, which leads to a sharp increase in permeability, resulting in rapid infiltration of nanoparticles into the perivascular space and eventual deposition in the entire tumor bed. 48 This phenomenon can be observed by fluorescently labeled nanoparticle imaging. Hanaoka et al 49 used IR700-YP7 bound to A431/G1 cells and induced rapid target-specific necrotic cell death by near-infrared light exposure in vitro. IR700-YP7 accumulated in A431/G1 tumors. As a result, tumor growth was inhibited by PIT compared with the nontreated control. Sano et al 48 took nude mice with A431 tumors as a model and administered panitumumab-IR700 (PAN-IR700) intravenously for 1 day; only the right tumor was treated with light. Pan-IR800 was injected at 1 hour, 6 hour, and 24 hour, and its distribution in tumors was observed.",

            "text": "Numerous nano drug delivery systems have been developed for preclinical cancer research in the past 15 years with the hope for a fundamental change in oncology. The robust nanotherapeutic research has yielded early-stage clinical products as exemplified by the FDA-approved nano formulations (Abraxane\u00ae for paclitaxel and Onyvide\u00ae for irinotecan) for the treatment of solid tumors, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). It is generally believed that enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) plays a key role in nanocarriers' accumulation in preclinical tumor models and is a clinically relevant phenomenon in certain cancer types. However, use of EPR effect as an across-the-board explanation for nanoparticle tumor access is likely over-simplified, particularly in the stroma rich solid tumors such as PDAC. Recently, ample evidences including our own data showed that it is possible to use transcytosis as a major mechanism for PDAC drug delivery. In this mini-review, we summarize the key studies that discuss how transcytosis can be employed to enhance EPR effect in PDAC, and potentially, other cancer malignancies. We also mentioned other vasculature engineering approaches that work beyond the classic EPR effect.",

            "text": "Abstract The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect controls passive nanodrug uptake in tumors and may provide a high tumor payload with prolonged retention for cancer treatment. However, EPR-mediated tumor uptake and distribution vary by cancer phenotype. Thus, we hypothesized that a companion PET imaging surrogate may benefit EPR-mediated therapeutic drug delivery. We developed two 89Zr-radiolabeled nanocarriers based on 4-armed starPEG40kDa with or without talazoparib (TLZ), a potent PARP inhibitor, as surrogates for the PEG-TLZ4 therapeutic scaffold. For PET imaging, PEG-DFB4 and PEG-DFB1-TLZ3 were radiolabeled with 89Zr by replacing one or all four copis of TLZ on PEG-TLZ4 with deferoxamine B (DFB). The radiolabeled nanodrugs [89Zr]PEG-DFB4 and [89Zr]PEG-DFB1-TLZ3 were tested in vivo in prostate cancer subcutaneous (s.c.) xenografts (22Rv1, LTL-545, and LTL-610) and 22Rv1 metastatic models. Their EPR-mediated tumoral uptake and penetration was compared with CT26, a known EPR-high cell line. MicroPET/CT images, organ biodistribution, and calculated kinetic parameters showed high uptake in CT26 and LTL-545 and moderate to low uptake in LTL-610 and 22Rv1. MicroPET/CT and high-resolution autoradiographic images showed nanocarrier penetration into highly permeable CT26, but heterogeneous peripheral accumulation was observed in LTL-545, LTL-610, and 22Rv1 s.c. xenografts and metastatic tumors. CD31 staining of tumor sections showed homogenous vascular development in CT26 tumors and heterogeneity in other xenografts. Both [89Zr]PEG-DFB4 and [89Zr]PEG-DFB1-TLZ3 showed similar accumulation and distribution in s.c. and meta",

            "text": "Wounding results in increased vascular permeability, a process that is markedly enhanced if a wound becomes infected. In response to infection, the mammalian host mobilizes an army of immunoglobulins, complement, white blood cells and cytokines. To allow this army to engage the enemy, the vascular system at the site of infection must open its gates. This process has been studied in detail and many of the biochemical mechanisms have been identified [1]. \n\nInterestingly, it has been said that tumors resemble \"unhealed wounds\" [2]. Accordingly, it is known that the vasculature of tumors is different from that of normal cells, and much effort has gone into exploiting this difference through therapeutic agents like Avastin [3][4][5]. A particularly important phenomenon related to this vascular distinction is referred to as Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) [6]. EPR has been identified in many experimental tumor systems and is believed to result from the aberrant tumor vasculature combined with a lack of functional lymphatics in solid tumors. Because of its selectivity for large molecules, EPR has been exploited for therapeutic purposes by using macromolecular drugs or nanoparticles within an appropriate size range [7][8][9][10]. One notable example is Doxil, a liposomal formulation of doxorubicin, which has been approved for the treatment of human cancers. We wondered whether generating an inflammatory environment within a tumor could enhance the EPR effect, just as infection within a wound dramatically enhances its vascular permeability. To test this approach, we determined whether inflammatory and vascular-active agents could improve selective nanoparticle accumulation within tumors and whether such accumulation would lead to improved therapeutic results in animal models.",

This effect enables the extravasation and retention of macromolecules in tumors, allowing nanocarriers with an appropriate particle size to enter the brain neoplasms via the endothelial gaps on the microvessels.",

            "text": "It is generally believed that the anatomy and pathophysiology of solid tumors differ from that of normal tissue. For example, solid tumors have a high blood vessel density to meet the nutrition and oxygen required by tumor cells growth. Furthermore, the tumor lacks functional lymphatic vessels and the gap between tumor endothelial cells is relatively large, which can extravasate or retain macromolecular drugs. The phenomenon that makes nanoparticles accumulate in tumor cells is called the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect [14][15][16]. \n\nThe discovery of this phenomenon has promoted the emergence of passive targeting nanoparticles, which can target tumors through the EPR effect. In research, oxaliplatin was encapsulated into N, O-carboxymethyl chitosan nanoparticles by ionic crosslinking, and resveratrol was encapsulated into them by emulsification crosslinking. The particle size of the former was about 190.0 nm and that of the latter was about 164.2 nm. The nanoparticles enhanced the solubility, stability, and EPR effect of oxaliplatin and resveratrol, showing stronger anti-CRC activity in subcutaneous tumor-bearing mice compared to the free drug [17]. \n\nHowever, according to research findings, nanoparticles smaller than 10 nm are filtered out by the kidneys, and particles larger than 100 nm are captured by the liver, so the ideal nanoparticles should be between 10 nm and 100 nm in size, which can circulate for a long time to increase the possibility of uptake by tumors [18]. Moreover, Anitha et al. [19] mentioned that the degree of vascularization in CRC is low. It can be seen that there are controversies about the EPR effect in CRC. In recent years, scientists have gradually realized that the tumor-targeting mediated by EPR is highly heterogeneous. Hence, it is necessary to enhance the targeting ability of nanoparticles based on EPR by combining them with other targeting mechanisms [20,21].",

Molecules under 200 nm [53,54], such as nanotherapeutics, can accumulate there and avoid healthy tissue distribution. Although techniques to implement the EPR effect on humans are challenging and time consuming [55], it is possible to observe a 25% greater intratumor exposure in patients for docetaxel nanoparticles [56]. However, a recent review declared that this improved accumulation was very heterogeneous and only represented 0.7% of the administered dose, leaving room for optimization [57]. The EPR effect is maximized when the extracellular matrix is low and there is a large amount of blood vessels [58]. Several techniques have, therefore, been studied to reshape tumor vascularization, such as antibodies that can increase tumor perfusion. Sorace et al. demonstrated in HER2+ breast cancer mice that trastuzumab-treated tumors versus control exhibited a significant increase in perfusion and vessel permeability (p = 0.035) [59]. Similar results were observed with trastuzumab engrafted on the liposomal surface, which turned poorly vascularized central tumors into highly vascularized ones when compared to ungrafted liposomes [60].",

            "text": "After administration, the targeting antibody/antibody fragments need to cross the vascular wall of the tumor blood vessels, in order to reach the tumor cells. Properties of both the targeting macromolecule (e.g., size, shape, and charge) and the vessel wall (e.g., pore size) can influence vascular permeability [reviewed in Ref. (13)]. Mathematical modeling, using a two-pore model of the capillary wall, clearly showed that there is an inverse correlation between the size of molecules (indicated by the molecular radius) and vascular permeability (14). Experimental data measuring the vascular permeability of molecules with different molecular weights in human colon adenocarcinoma xenografts are in agreement with this prediction (15). Tumor vasculature has significant differences to that of healthy tissues. Hypervascularization and increased vascular permeability, with vessels having abnormal architecture due to the higher cell proliferation rate, as well as wider fenestrations ( 16) are features that promote tumor accumulation of larger macromolecules. In addition to irregular blood vasculature, there is often a lack of a proper lymphatic network inside tumors. This results in inefficient lymphatic drainage allowing for better retention of macromolecules in tumors (17,18). This enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect is reported to occur in the majority of solid tumors (19). The EPR effect facilitates the accumulation of non-targeted macromolecules larger than ~40 kDa in tumors, giving an advantage to the use of larger molecules. This molecular size dependence of the EPR effect is directly linked to the systemic clearance (discussed in detail below) of the injected probes. Macromolecules larger than 40 kDa manage to circumvent renal excretion resulting in extended circulation time, increasing the chances of extravasation in the tumor interstitium (20,21). Despite this contribution to the targeting process, the EPR effect, when present, does not guarantee sufficient and specific tumor penetration that is crucial for therapeutic applications.",

            "text": "Over a period of decade, many types of cancers are being treated by conventional chemotherapy using small molecules. Lack of tumour selectivity results in developing severe adverse side effects; consequently drug doses need to be used in less volumes. Drug efficacy also remains suboptimal [81]. To improve the bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy of hydrophobic drugs, development of site specific tumour targeted chemotherapy is the most effective approach for treating different types of cancers most successfully with ease. Tumour specific targeting at vascular and tissue level can be achieved by the breakthrough discovery of enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect of solid tumours. Pathophysiological and anatomical features of tumor vessels are attributed to the rate and extent of EPR effect in most solid tumours. As a result, many researchers across the globe have been employing the concept of tumor targeting drug delivery following the concept of EPR effect to develop efficient and effective anticancer drugs [82]. \n\nTissues undergoing some pathological conditions result in diseases such as cancer or inflammation exhibits the characteristic abnormal vasculature, which enhances the permeability, retention, and extravasation of macromolecular drugs. Activation of vascular permeability factors as well as deregulated angiogenesis contributes to EPR effect of solid tumours. Important characteristic features of abnormal vasculature include formation of large fenestrations (300 nm to 4,700 nm in size) between the endothelial cells because of its discontinuous features. Activation of proangiogenic and antiangiogenic molecules and imbalance in their expression lead to the formation of large fenestration [83]. Abnormal porous vasculature, compression of the lymphatic vessels as a result of increase in number of cancer cells, and dysfunctional lymphangiogenesis, which causes lymphatic drainage impairment in tumor tissues, are also among other factors. \n\nInterstitial fluid of tumours, which constitutes any constructs or macromolecules including encapsulated drugs or antibodies, is retained for longer period than in normal tissues [84][85][86][87] (Figure 2).",

            "text": "The Active Nanotargeting of MBC 3.1. Why and How to Target Tumor Cells? Nanotechnological strategies have consistently improved the therapeutic index of anthracyclines and taxanes, mainly by ameliorating their toxicity profiles. However, improvements in clinical outcomes are controversial, and no substantial changes in overall survival have been observed compared to conventional chemotherapy in most cases. This piece of data probably reflects the fact that nanoparticles often accumulate into the tumor mass by enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, while hardly entering the tumor cells. The EPR effect allows proteins larger than 30 kDa to passively extravasate from the blood vessels into the tumor interstitial space, thanks to the increased vascular permeability in correspondence with the tumor endothelium. Indeed, during tumor growth, neoangiogenesis is promoted in order to satisfy the increasing oxygen demand and, at the same time, the endothelium of the new blood vessels is tortuous, poorly differentiated, and leaky, thus allowing molecules extravasation. Moreover, solid tumors lack functional lymphatics and are unable to eliminate extravasated nanomaterials, thus contributing to increasing nanoparticles accumulation and prolonged retention within the tumor [79,80]. Therefore, the EPR effect has become one of the most exploited biological phenomena for nanotherapeutic strategies. Nonetheless, it is a complex process depending on many factors such as tumor type, tumor microenvironment, and nanoparticle properties, and it does not ensure the intracellular delivery of the drug [79]. Certainly, the passive diffusion of nanoformulated drugs through leaky tumor vasculature may have a prominent role for the treatment of primary tumors with more than 100 mm 3 in volume; however, it remains less effective in a metastatic setting. Metastases are only poorly accessible to molecular or nanoparticle agents because of their small size, high dispersion to organs, and low vascularization if compared to primary tumors [12,81]. As a consequence, the EPR effect is not sufficient for proper drug nanodelivery to these sites, and the development of effective therapies toward metastases still remains a main challenge in cancer treatment.",

            "text": "The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect is responsible for the passive accumulation of nanomedicines into tumor tissue [12]. The effect is a result of the rapid and abnormal growth of tumor blood vessels, which leads to increased fenestrations between cells and poor lymphatic drainage. These circumstances enable nanomedicines to extravasate from the blood pool into the tumor tissue and being retained there (Fig. 1B) [13e15].\n\nOverall, prolonging circulation time in the blood increases the likelihood of tumor accumulation via the EPR effect, simply because more nanomedicines pass through the leaky tumor vasculature over time.\n\nTumor accumulation via EPR is, among other things, dependent on the physicochemical characteristics of the nanomedicine itself. In particular the size, surface properties, shape and charge can alter accumulation [5,16]. Besides matching the gap sizes of the leaky tumor vessels, the dimensions of the nanomedicine should also be such that early clearance from the blood is avoided [17,18]. To prevent renal excretion, nanomedicines should typically be larger than~6 nm. On the other hand, nanomedicines larger tha\u00f1 200 nm are rapidly recognized and sequestered by the reticuloendothelial system (RES) (mainly consisting of the liver and the spleen). Furthermore, the surface of the nanomedicine has also an influence on RES recognition. Neutrally charged nanomedicines tend to be better shielded from recognition and therefore have longer circulation times. A common strategy to prevent RES recognition of nanomedicines is shielding them from RESfacilitating proteins (opsonins) by decorating the surface with neutralizing molecules such as poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) [17].\n\nThe tumor microenvironment can also affect the accumulation of passively targeting nanomedicines [8,19]. For example, the vascular density is commonly unevenly distributed throughout solid tumors with the highest abundance in the periphery at the host interface and lowest in hypoxic and adjacent necrotic regions. Abnormal vessel structure causes irregular blood flow within tumors and impaired lymphatic drainage can lead to high interstitial pressure gradients in the tumor microenvir",

Tumor blood vessels are characterized by leaky vasculature, decreased lymphatic drainage. An effect indicating passive retention was identified by Maeda et al., which is called the 'Enhanced Permeation and Retention (EPR) effect'. 1] Accrediting their low molecular weight and nonspecific diffusion, free anticancer drugs tend to easily pass between the intercellular spaces. As a result, they remain in the bloodstream for a shorter time and the probability of reaching the drug to the tumor site decreases. Drugs anchored with nanocarriers bring larger sizes against intracellular spaces, they sustain in the circulation for a longer time. As the blood vessels surrounding tumor tissues are defective and porous, nanocarrier containing anti-cancer drugs can permeate through blood vessels towards tumorous tissues, wherein they accumulate and show the desired pharmacological effect. Thus, nanomedicines, on account of the EPR effect, extravasate into the tumor environment. 22 The EPR differs with types of tumor, their progression and location. Besides, the properties of the nanocarriers used, too affect the extravasation of nanomedicines.",

Meanwhile, tumors' inadequate lymphatic drainage enables them to congregate close to the cancer cells. Normal tissues do not experience an EPR effect. The EPR effect is primarily influenced by two factors: size and biocompatibility. It is necessary to have an extended circulation period in order to provide sufficient time for the EPR effect to distribute the drug. The majority of phytochemicals have low molecular weights, have a rapid clearance rate in living organisms, and are widely distributed throughout healthy tissues and organs [112]. Here, we have discussed a few of the extensively studied nanoformulated phytochemicals against CRC. exhibit improved solubility in addition to other benefits. The formation of nanoparticles alters the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of phytochemicals, increasing their therapeutic index by reducing toxicity and raising efficacy, as shown in Figure 4. For instance, creating antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) by combining phytochemicals and antibodies can deliver powerful cytotoxic phytochemicals to cancerous cells in a targeted manner. The diameters of these conjugates are in the nanometer range. High-potency cytotoxic phytochemicals have a wider treatment window because ADCs are more selective for tumors than other organs [63,85,111]. The main method used by nanovehicles to tumor targets is the superior permeability and retention (EPR) effect. Most solid tumors have insufficient lymphatic drainage and blood vessel architectural defects. The nanocarriers and macromolecules can leak preferentially from the blood arteries neighboring a tumor [55]. Meanwhile, tumors' inadequate lymphatic drainage enables them to congregate close to the cancer cells. Normal tissues do not experience an EPR effect. The EPR effect is primarily influenced by two factors: size and biocompatibility. It is necessary to have an extended circulation period in order to provide sufficient time for the EPR effect to distribute the drug.",

A relevant study by Black et al., demonstrated the effect of PDE5 inhibitors on enhancing tumor vascular permeability in the brain tumor model of 9L gliosarcoma-bearing in rats. Sildenafil administration increased the tumor capillary permeability in comparison to the normal brain capillaries that showed no significant increase in vascular permeability. Additionally, the study proved a synergistic effect of the use of anthracycline chemotherapy combined with the sildenafil and further improved the survival by nearly 2 folds longer than the group treated with the chemotherapeutic agent alone [71]. Another work by Zhang et al. provided a further direct evidence of the in vivo on the potential of PDE 5 inhibitors on augmenting EPR mediated anticancer chemotherapy. In their study the team employed a combined micelle incorporating both cisplatin and sildenafil. The team proposed that tumor acidity can preferentially release the PDE5 inhibitor from the micelle, further augmenting its concentration in tumor tissues. This strategy was proved effective in increasing both drug accumulation and anticancer activity in the tested cancer model of B16F10 melanoma in C57BL/6 mice. All together indicating a potential and promising rule for PDE5 inhibitors in augmenting EPR based anticancer drug delivery [72].",

            "text": "In 1986, Matsumura [193] proposed a phenomenon where nanoparticles with specific sizes displayed tumor accumulation properties. This tumoritropic performance was then recognized as enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect and played an indispensable role in nanoscale drug delivery therapy field (Fig. 9). With respect to tumorous tissues, the augmented angiogenesis is prone to accompany with wide inter-endothelial gap, poor vessel structural integrity and lymphatic reflux deficiency. These vascular alterations enable micromolecular substances (100 nm to 200 nm) to selectively permeate and retain in tumor surroundings [194]. The EPR effect endows drug delivery systems with passive targeting ability and contributes to increased therapeutic efficiency as well as reduced systemic side effects. However, controversy exists since the EPR effect tremendously varies intratumorally and intertumorally due to distinct tumor microenvironments and vascular densities [195,196]. Warrenet al. [197] demonstrated that rare nanoparticles could passively penetrate into the tumor vessels of ovarian cancer, breast cancer and GBM. Based on mouse models, human tumorous tissues and mathematical models, conclusion was made that 97% of nanoparticles were transported through active process instead of passive diffusion [197]. Ding et al. [198] held opposite opinion that 87% renal cancer exhibited significant EPR effect, despite considerable heterogeneity was also observed in tumors with different size and gender (male samples showed intensified EPR) [198]. The EPR effect  may eventually depend on the specific tumor pathophysiology, because differences were observed in the variety of tumor types. Although numerous EPR effect studies based on animal models achieved significant efficacy, the majority of which were failed to be translated into clinic [199]. Therefore, more intensive investigations should be conducted to fully illustrate the EPR effect behind nanoparticle drug delivery platforms. Conventional anti-GBM drug delivery is invariably accompanied by unsatisfactory bio-distribution and systemic side effects. Since plenty of therapeutic agents against GBM cells fail to reach the action site and function in vivo, novel nanoscale biomaterials have been developed as vehicle to escort them.",

There are plenty of systems that enhance the accumulation efficacy to tumor via EPR effect (Regehly et al., 2007;Lee et al., 2009). However, this targeting strategy may release a considerable quantity of drugs before substantial uptake by tumor cells. Moreover, recently the EPR effect is becoming a controversial topic as researchers found that human bodies do not have obvious leakage of tumor vasculature and EPR effect. Hence, the general applicability of this EPR effect is challenged and still an open question.",

            "text": "Early time post intravenous injection, elevated 18 F-NEB signal intensity in surgical hindlimb indicated improvement of blood reperfusion stimulated by VEGF, justifying the feasibility of 18 F-NEB serving as a blood-pool imaging agent. Late time post intravenous injection, higher 18 F-NEB uptake in ischemic tissue indicated vascular permeability enhancement, which is also closely related with VEGF-induced angiogenesis. Our data demonstrated that VEGF-induced enhancement of both blood perfusion and vascular permeability in ischemic tissues could be monitored by 18 F-NEB alone. Real-time and non-invasive evaluation of the treatment response will provide detailed information to predict drug delivery efficiency and guide the individualized therapeutic strategy during the development and treatment of HI. It is worth to notice that even in delayed 18 F-NEB PET imaging (2 h p.i.), the influence of blood perfusion exists. However, the tracer accumulation at this time is mainly resulted from albumin/NEB complex extravasation rather than that still in blood vessels. Thus, we believe delayed 18 F-NEB PET dominantly reflect vascular permeability. \n\nFor clinical application, apart from PAD, there are also some other factors that can alter the permeability of 18 F-NEB. Malignant tumors often show increased uptake and retention of high-molecular-weight non-targeted drugs and prodrugs, which is known as the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect (27). EPR in tumors has been attributed to vascular permeability enhancement and decreased efflux of macromolecules from the pathological locus. Several features of infection-induced inflammation resemble these processes. Therefore, enhanced permeability of 18 F-NEB can also occur in solid tumor, infective tissue or inflammatory lesion in patients.",

(99), who reported that there are other parameters that might contribute to the EPR effect on NP extravasation, which are not yet known.\n\nParadoxical to the EPR effect of tumors which can be exploited for passive targeting, tumors have higher interstitial fluid pressure.After extravasation, deep penetration of the NPs to the tumors can be deflected due to the resistance faced by higher interstitial fluid pressure.LoCastro et al. (100) concluded that computational fluid modeling based on dynamic contrastenhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) could allow DCE-MRI to be a feasible interstitial fluid pressure (and velocity) modeling apparatus in neck nodal metastases.It is important to explore this area, as this affects the dose of NPs required for optimal therapeutic efficacy against the tumor.\n\nAttributed to angiogenesis and invasive growth and/or migration of tumors, the neovasculature encapsulating tumors is spatially irregular, differing from the regular vascular network of a tumor-absent biological system.Angiogenesis leads to differential circulation of blood in different parts of the tumorigenic tissue.",

            "text": "PTs of specific sizes passively accumulate in tumors due to the EPR effect, which arises as a consequence of leaky tumor vasculature and poor lymphatic drainage. Many have sought to take advantage of the EPR effect instead of employing molecular targeting, by assuming that EPR represents a universal factor in solid cancers that would allow us to overcome tumor heterogeneity (e.g., related to mutation load). However, not all tumor types display EPR-mediated targeting and the process can be tumor-size dependent. The tumor vasculature is a dynamic, inflammatory environment with both vascular permeability and blood velocity complex and kinetically variable from segment to segment [81]. Recent studies employing intravital confocal laser scanning microscopy have described the transient and stochastic occurrence of 'dynamic vents' associated with leaky blood vessels, underscoring the heterogeneity and evolution of the vasculature and hence, altered targeting, by the EPR effect [82]. Furthermore, metastatic sites and the primary tumor will also differ with regard to their potential for passive targeting [83]. \n\nThe first evidence for heterogeneity of EPR-mediated targeting came over 20 years ago following administration of a 131 I-labelled HPMA-copolymer doxorubicin (Dox) [84] and several clinical studies (using liposomal formulations of chemotherapeutic agents) have suggested the value of stratifying subpopulations of cancer patients according to their likelihood of EPR-mediated targeting [85][86][87]. Other techniques used to assess EPR include tumor imaging using iodine-labeling [32,84,88], including the well-known contract agent Lipiodol [78], technetium-labeling [87] and more recently, copper-labeling [89], highlighting both the relative ease of assessing and the general importance of this biomarker.",

            "text": "Tumor cells are known to exhibit pathophysiological characteristics different from that of regular cells. Passive targeting capitalizes on these differences to target delivery of the drug to the site of interest through what is commonly referred to as the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect (Parveen et al., 2012). EPR is a phenomenon where molecules of certain sizes accumulate to a greater extent in tumor cells than normal cells. The accumulation is attributed to differences such as hypervasculature, lack of effective lymphatic drainage and increased production of permeability mediators (Maeda, Wu, & Sawa et al., 2000;Wakaskar, 2017c). Maeda et al. reported one of the first tumor targeted delivery of anticancer styrene-maleic acid copolymer-conjugated neocarzinostatin in 1979 (Maeda, Takeshita, & Kanamaru, 1979), eventually leading to the introduction of the phenomena of EPR in solid tumors in 1986 (Matsumura & Maeda, 1986). For a better understanding, we refer the audience to an excellent review by Maeda et al. describing the pathophysiological mechanisms of the EPR effect, anatomical differences of tumor blood vessel, various factors involved and artificial augmentation of EPR effect with respect to tumor-selective delivery, and the advantages and problems of macromolecular drugs (Maeda, Bharate, & Daruwalla, 2009;Wakaskar, 2017h). The discovery of EPR has proved to be a breakthrough in tumor-targeted drug delivery (Greish, 2007;Gullotti & Yeo, 2009;Maeda, 2001;Matsumura & Maeda, 1986) and has been exploited for delivering various therapeutics by researchers. Despite the potential that nanocarriers offer as therapeutic agents through EPR, it is critical to select those with apposite properties so as to enhance the period of circulation and prevent immune response. Toward this end, researchers have found that nanocarriers with a size range of 10-100 nm is ideal (Wakaskar, 2015).",

            "text": "Nanoparticle tumor targeting or delivery is based on the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect . EPR effect is a hallmark for targeted drug delivery of biocompatible nanomedicine or macromolecular drugs in tumor tissue [53,96,99,[103][104][105][106][107][108][109]. The effect can be observed in both primary and metastatic tumors. The EPR effect can be visualized in vivo tumor models or human tumors [99,108]. The EPR effect reflects pathophysiology of solid tumor including defective vascular architecture, upregulated neoangiogenesis and excessive production of various vascular mediators. It is noteworthy that these factors are common immune disruptors and contribute to the immune dysfunction. \n\nEvaluation of some drug encapsulated liposomes and micellar nanoparticles reveal another example of failed attempts in cancer chemotherapy. Nanotechnologybased nanomedicine has been the focus of great attention in the past couple of decades. Initially, liposome particles presented the poorest outcomes in the pharmacokinetics because of little considerations of the rapid clearance and removal of nanoparticles by phagocytic cells. However, current methods of attaching biocompatible polymers such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) to the surface of particles potentially protect them against this problem. However, in the in vivo setting, it is important that drugencapsulated liposomes or nanoparticles remain stable and intact enough to reach to the target tissues without disruption of particles or micelles on its way to reach cancer clumps. Otherwise, the active component of LMW drug would often leak out from such particles during circulation and subject to rapid clearance by urinary tract or lymphatic channels, as well as potential decomposition by the liver and the bile. The possibility that particles would burst before reaching the target make such drugs to lose effectiveness while producing adverse effects similar to the parental LMW drug given iv as shown in Fig. 2a, b.",

            "text": "Since Matsumura and Maeda [67] reported on the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect for the delivery of macromolecules in cancer therapy, there has been a prevailing philosophy to design nanomedicines for cancer imaging and treatment characterized by nanoparticles with a spherical shape, an average diameter of 100 nm, and a surface mostly decorated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains [67,68]. Particularly, Maeda et al. [69,70] observed in preclinical in vivo models that endothelial cells of tumor vessels are not tightly connected but they rather exhibit irregular fenestrations ranging in size from several tens up to a few hundreds of nanometers. This peculiar characteristic has stimulated scientists in developing a plethora of blood-borne spherical nanoparticles sufficiently small to pass through these fenestrations and be retained within the diseased tissue. This variety of nanoparticles relies on self-assembly and colloidal interactions and differ in their material compositions, sizes, and surface properties. Specifically, both organic (e.g., lipids, polymers, block copolymers), and nonorganic (e.g., iron oxide, gold, silver) materials have been employed [71][72][73]. Nanoparticle surfaces have been modified with different coatings, including lipids, stealth polymer chains that enhance particle blood longevity, and a variety of moieties for recognizing specific cancer cell molecules enabling what is known as active targeting [74][75][76][77][78].\n\nIndeed, the US food and Drug Administration approved the first EPR-dependent nano-drug, known as Doxil, in 1995, putting in the spotlight nanotechnology and its benefits in the fight against cancer [79]. However, the universal utility of the EPR effect in the fight against cancer has recently been re-scrutinized, and alternative delivery strategies are necessary to facilitate the delivery of therapeutics to tumors [80][81][82]. Particularly, recent studies have shown that the EPR effects might not be as clinically relevant as it is in mice, as the size of the irregular vascular fenestrations and their density depend on the type and the stage",

The tumor concentration of blue albumin was about 10 fold higher than that of blood at 145 hrs (Fig. 2A). This phenomenon was coined the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. We also confirmed the EPR effect by using radiolabeled serum proteins; IgG (170 kDa), transferrin (90 kDa), albumin (67 kDa), and ovalbumin (48 kDa). However, we did not observe the EPR effect with low molecular weight proteins such as ovomucoid (29 kDa) and neocarzinostatin (12 kDa). 27) o confirm the molecular weight dependency of the EPR effect, we used biocompatible synthetic copolymers of hydroxypropyl methacrylate (HPMA), which ranged in size from 4.5 to 800 kDa, 28)-31) that was kindly provided by Professors Karel Ulbrich and Ruth Duncan. We reconfirmed our earlier findings: most biocompatible plasma proteins and HPMA polymers between 4.5 and 800 kDa exhibited the EPR effect (Fig. 3A,B). 28)-33) A more detailed time course study showed that the tumor uptake of HPMA copolymers after intravenous injection was relatively rapid: some showed a marked tumor uptake within a few hours, while smaller HPMA copolymers, about 30 kDa or smaller, showed no EPR effect. Figure 3B illustrates the relationship among tumor uptake, plasma concentration, and renal clearance in terms of drug size (MW). A relatively long circulation time after intravenous injection was needed for the EPR effect to occur. For progressive drug accumulation to tumor, high drug concentrations in circulation is needed.",

            "text": "Over 20,000 Americans are diagnosed annually with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) [1]. Standard treatment usually consists of surgery, radiation therapy (RT), and temozolomide chemotherapy, but median survival is only about 14.6 months [2]. Given these unsatisfactory results, new therapeutic approaches are clearly needed. Although other chemotherapeutic drugs such as paclitaxel (Taxol) are even more effective against GBM cells in vitro than temozolomide [3], they have been found to be clinically ineffective against GBM [4]. The limited efficacy of such drugs has been attributed to an inability to achieve therapeutic concentrations of these drugs in the tumor due to the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB)specifically the BBB within the tumor. Modulation of both drug delivery and the integrity of the BBB thus represent promising strategies for enhancing treatment efficacy. \n\nSolid tumors often have vascular systems that are leaky and have impaired blood flow compared to the circulation through normal tissue. Structural characteristics of tumor vascularity such as increased tortuosity, irregular shape and dilation of blood vessels coupled with endothelial fenestrations result in leakage of blood plasma macromolecules and drugs into tumor tissue. The extravasation of these plasma macromolecules into tumors and their concentration and retention within the tumor is a phenomenon referred to as the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect [5,6]. The EPR effect is the basis, for example, of preferential uptake of gadolinium contrast agents into tumors compared to normal brain tissue, as observed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The anatomical and physiological factors promoting the EPR effect that lead to increased extravasation of drugs and macromolecules from the serum into tumors are not uniformly distributed throughout tumors [7,8]. The EPR effect is often maximal at core regions within a tumor, regions frequently characterized by necrosis, while the EPR effect is diminished at the peripheral zones of a tumor. These peripheral areas may contain many viable cancer cells and are also the regions where the tumor BBB is most likely to remain intact.",

As of now, a patient's prognosis hinges on the discovery of cancerous cells early enough and in a stage that is manageable for possible treatment. Newly developed nanotechnological techniques are bringing hope to the world of oncologic research. Currently, nanotechniques are being tested and used for the improvement of current technologies and for the development of new ones, in cancer detection, prevention, and treatment.\n\nIt is the innate qualities of nanoparticles that make them advantageous for use in cancer management. Nanoscale particles have a maximum surface to volume ratio making them perfect for surface functionalization and conjugation with therapeutic agents. Also, due to their size and malleable surface properties, nanoparticles can be synthesized to use passive or active targeting systems with superior tumor specificity than current drug methods (1,2).\n\nPassive targeting takes advantage of differences between cancer cells and healthy cells and tissues. Two of the differences include a leaky vasculature and an acidic tumor microenvironment (2). Cancer cells grow rapidly, which requires speedy vascularization leading to a defective vascular architecture that is more permeable to macromolecules than normal tissues. This increased permeability makes cancerous tissues easily accessible to chemotherapeutic drugs (Fig. 1), and with the lack of lymphatic drainage in the tumor bed, the result is an accumulation of the drug within cancer cells (2). This effect, called the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, also affects the ability of a cell to uptake vital nutrients and oxygen (3). It is a response to overcome limited cell respiration that results in nanoparticles having the ability to penetrate interstitial tumor vasculature with higher retention times than regular tissues (4,5). The EPR effect is important as it is observed in all nanoparticle categories (6).\n\nThe microenvironment of a tumor is another aid to passive targeting. Within cancer cells, the",

            "text": "Peroxynitrite (ONOO \u2010), which is generated from nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide anion (O2\u2010) under pathological conditions, plays an important role in pathophysiological processes. Activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) contributes to tumor angiogenesis and metastasis. NO mediates the enhanced vascular permeability and retention (EPR) effect in solid tumors, and ONOO\u2010 activates proMMP to MMP in vitro. In this study, we examined the role of ONOO\u2010 in the EPR effect in solid tumors and normal tissues as related to MMP activation. Authentic ONOO\u2010, at 50 nmol or higher concentrations, induced the enhanced vascular permeability in normal dorsal skin of mice. ONOO\u2010 scavengers ebselen and uric acid significantly suppressed the EPR effect in mouse sarcoma 180 (S\u2010180) tumors. Indirect evidence for formation of ONOO\u2010 in S\u2010180 and mouse colon adenocarcinoma (C\u201038) tumors included strong immunostaining for nitrotyrosine in the tumor tissue, predominantly surrounding the tumor vessels. MMP inhibitor BE16627B (66.6 mg/kg i.v., given 2 tunes) or SI\u201027 (10 mg/kg i.p., given 2 times) significantly suppressed the ONOO\u2010induced EPR effect in S\u2010180 tumors and in normal skin. Soybean trypsin inhibitor (Kunitz type), broad\u2010spectrum proteinase inhibitor ovomacroglobulin, and bradykinin receptor antagonist HOE 140 also significantly suppressed the ONOO\u2010induced EPR effect in normal skin tissues. These data suggest that ONOO\u2010 may be involved in and promote the EPR effect in tumors, which could be mediated partly through activation of MMPs and a subsequent proteinase cascade to generate potent vasoactive mediators such as bradykinin.",

            "text": "EPR-mediated drug systems have prodigious therapeutic potential. However, intraand inter-tumoral, inter-patient heterogeneity in EPR effect, and physiological barriers associated with it pose a big challenge in drug delivery. Actively targeted drug delivery systems are greatly beneficial for the treatment of hematological malignancies. For solid tumors, active targeting must rely on EPR-mediated accumulation in tumors. To assess the EPR effect, the development of fast, quantitative EPR-imaging technologies is necessary. Several strategies have also been proposed that bypass the EPR effect, including cell-mediated delivery of nanoparticles and immune-modulating payload release in tumors. Such approaches should be useful for the treatment of low-EPR tumors, hematological malignancies, and metastatic cancers. Besides, local delivery of drugs using nanoparticles, hydrogels, implants, etc., can bypass physiological barriers of EPR-targeted delivery [5,20,21]. Moreover, the CAST therapy might be another approach to compensate for the inadequate effect of the EPR targeting [14]. Recently, mAb-based therapies for solid tumors has been proposed to overcome tumor heterogeneity, efficient delivery to tumor, durable therapeutic and clinical outcome in a large subset of patients, and enhanced prognosis [18]. Table 3 shows some selected EPR-based drug delivery systems [173]. Development of more predictive animal models, including PDX and organoids, and EPR-imaging techniques and adoption of GLP, standardization guidelines, are necessary for translation of ERP-based therapies to the clinic. Development of PDX and organoid libraries to share information of the EPR patients, EPR tumors, and outcome of EPRmediated drug delivery research will be helpful to predict appropriate therapy for the patients more rapidly and accurately.

            "text": "Passive targeting is another important strategy that exploits the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, a phenomenon whereby nanoparticles preferentially accumulate in tumor tissues due to the leaky vasculature and poor lymphatic drainage that are characteristic of solid tumors. Although passive targeting does not involve specific ligand-receptor interactions, it allows for the preferential concentration of nanoparticles in the tumor microenvironment, thereby increasing the local concentration of the drug and enhancing its efficacy. \n\nWhile passive targeting is inherently less selective than active targeting, it plays a crucial role in delivering nanoparticles to solid tumors, including CRC. The EPR effect is particularly effective for larger nanoparticles, such as liposomes and polymeric nanoparticles, which can accumulate in tumor tissues more readily than smaller particles. However, the effectiveness of the EPR effect can vary significantly between patients and tumor types, leading to variability in therapeutic outcomes. For example, tumors with dense stromal tissue or poor vasculature may exhibit a reduced EPR effect, limiting the accumulation of nanoparticles. \n\nTo address these limitations, combining passive and active targeting strategies has been proposed as a synergistic approach that can enhance the specificity and efficacy of nanoparticlebased drug delivery systems. For instance, nanoparticles that initially accumulate in the tumor via the EPR effect can be further targeted to specific cancer cells using surface ligands, thus providing a dual-targeting approach that maximizes drug delivery and minimizes off-target effects. This dual-targeting strategy has been shown to improve therapeutic outcomes in preclinical models of CRC by ensuring that the drug is delivered directly to the tumor cells, even in heterogeneous tumor environments. \n\nOverall, the integration of active and passive targeting strategies represents a promising approach for improving the precision and effectiveness of nanoparticle-based therapies for CRC. As research continues to advance, the development of more sophisticated targeting mechanisms will likely lead to even greater improvements in the treatment of this challenging disease.",

            "text": "Nanoparticles have become a powerful tool in the clinical field, not only by their capacity to deliver drugs to diseased tissues in a controlled and selective manner [1], but also by their ability to simultaneously provide information about the stage of the disease progression [2]. Nanosystems endowed with these dual functions, drug delivery, and diagnosis, received the name of theranostic nanocarriers. Among the different clinical applications of these smart nanocarriers, antitumoral therapy have received the highest attention [3]. The origin of this interest began in 1986, when Maeda and Matsumura reported the passive tendency of intravenously injected nanometric agents to be accumulated within solid tumors [4]. The accelerated growth of solid tumors demands the rapid construction of tumoral blood vessels in order to provide the required nutrients to sustain them. These vessels are built in an uncontrollable manner presenting wide interendothelial junctions which create pores with diameters with up to a few hundreds of nanometers [5]. Thus, when nanoparticles that were injected in the blood stream reach the tumoral tissue, they can pass through these fenestrations being selectively accumulated there. Moreover, solid tumors usually present inefficient drainage system. This is a consequence of the compression of lymphatic vessels due the expansion of tumoral tissue, which enhances the retention time of the nanoparticles within the diseased tissue. The combination of these two characteristics, high permeability of tumoral blood vessels and inefficient drainage, constitutes to the gold standard of the use of nanoparticles in oncology and receives the name of enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) effect [6]. The discovery of EPR effect triggered the race to design nanocarriers capable to selectively deliver chemotherapeutic agents to tumoral tissue reducing the systemic toxicity caused by these drugs in healthy tissues. Thus, a vast number of different nanoparticles composed of both organic materials as polymers [7], lipids [8], and dendrimers [9] as well as by inorganic ones such as metals [10], ceramics [11], and carbon allotropes [12], among others have been reported exhibiting excellent drug delivery capacities.",

            "text": "conventional chemotherapy is currently still problematic because of the disproportional relationship between antitumor effects and adverse effects. Anticancer agents are easily distributed in the patient's body and indiscriminately reach not only tumors, but also normal organs and tissues. Therefore, the development of a suitable tumor-selective drug delivery system is needed to avoid the undesirable systemic side effects of anticancer agents. The most effective strategy is to exploit the anatomical and pathophysiological abnormalities of tumor tissue, particularly the tumor vasculature. 1) ][4] This characteristic is generally known as the \"enhanced permeability and retention (EPR)\" effect [5][6][7] (Fig. 1). \n\nTumor localization of nanocarriers after systemic administration is thought to involve three processes (Fig. 1A): distribution through the vascular compartment in solid tumors, transport across the angiogenic vascular wall (extravasation from tumor blood circulation), and diffusion within the tumor interstitium. Various nanocarriers for anticancer agents that benefit from the EPR effect have been developed as drug delivery carriers. However, in spite of some benefits in anticancer drug delivery, nanocarriers (of any design) have not always shown sufficient delivery of associated agents to tumors, and have resulted in insufficient therapeutic effects. The tumor microenvironment, for example, spatial heterogeneity of vascular permeability and/or hypovascularity, appears to become a barrier to extravasation of nanocarriers from tumor vasculature and their diffusion in the interstitium of solid tumors (Fig. 1B). In this article, we describe and discuss some trials that attempt to manipulate the barriers in the tumor microenvironment that hinder extravasation through the tumor vasculature and penetration of nanocarriers in solid tumors.",

            "text": "With the development of contrast agents such as micro/nanobubbles (MNBs) [23][24][25], magnetic nanoparticles [26,27], radionuclides, and fluorophores, the EPR effect can be accurately visualized and quantified [28][29][30][31]. \n\nNanomaterialbased EPR targeting strategies mainly focus on controlling the size of the drug or carrier and/or using ligands that bind to molecules that are related to the EPR effect. An appropriately sized material can pass through the permeable tumor vascular system and passively accumulate in the tumor tissue via passive targeting. The modification of the ligands on the surface leads to active targeting. The transport of the micro-materials and nanomaterials in tumor tissue is shown in Figure 2. Perfluorocarbon (PFC) nanodroplets can accumulate in the tumor tissue via passive targeting, and the targeted microbubbles and nanobubbles are used to realize active targeting. To enhance the efficacy of delivery, three approaches based on the EPR effect have been developed. The first approach involves exerting physical exogenous factors (light [32][33][34], heat [35][36][37], ultrasound [38][39][40][41], and radiation [42,43]) to promote the permeability of tumor blood vessels and tissues. The second is to develop tumor microenvironmenttargeted smart responsive nanomaterials to improve the permeability and retention of drugs at the tumor site [44][45][46][47][48]. The third is to combine the internal biochemical response with external regulatory factors. Some micro-nano materials have special properties because of which they can respond to internal and external triggers. Using a series of biological effects generated during such a response, the drug delivery efficiency at the tumor site can be further improved. In this review, we summarize the EPR effects based on ultrasound and MNBs and the enhancement of these effects. First, the physical effects of ultrasound on EPR are briefly introduced. The interaction between EPR-and MNB-assisted acoustic energy is highlighted.",

            "text": "There are two main strategies in terms of targeting the drugs to tumors; passive targeting and active targeting. As part of the passive targeting strategies, various nanocarrier agents have been used to promote their particular accumulation within tumors through the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect (Zhang et al., 2020). The EPR effect is a common concept for solid tumors associated with their pathophysiological and anatomical differences from normal tissues (Matsumura and Maeda, 1986). The EPR effect is manifested by enhanced accumulation of macromolecules (e.g. liposomes, drugs, and NPs) in tumor tissues in contrast to normal tissues. The mechanism underlying this effect is attributed to the leaky vessels around tumors as well as dysfunctional lymphatic system (Perrault and Chan, 2010;Maeda, 2013). The blood vessels with such leaky pores can augment the transport of circulating nanoparticles into the tumor. On the other hand, the transportation in nonmalignant tissues is hindered by the intact barrier of the vasculature. EPR effect has been proposed to be due to the rapid growth of tumor cells, which require surplus amounts of crucial nutrients; thus, inducing the dysregulated formation of blood vasculatures. The size of nanoparticles should be between 10 and 200 nm to achieve the passive targeting effect (Allison et al., 2008). The EPR effect is also dependent on other features of nanoparticles, such as the charge, the shape, circulation time in blood and hydrophilicity (Bertrand et al., 2014). Even though the EPR effect has been demonstrated to have promising results in preclinical in vitro studies, there still exist important issues that should be solved in order to translate this approach into the clinical setting (Fang et al., 2011). The passive targeting strategy may fail to achieve the desired favorable therapeutic effects in certain early stage tumors, because of the regular vasculature of such tissues. Furthermore, vessel leakiness and permeability may not be homogeneous in a tumor tissue. Thus, targeting via EPR might yield heterogeneous effects (Peer et al., 2007).",

            "text": "The term passive targeting can be defined as the accumulation of nanoparticles in solid tumors. The foundation of passive targeting was discovered by Matsumura and Meda around 1986. They found two key observations to passive targeting: (1) spontaneous accumulation of drug carrier in areas of solid tumors with leaky vascular and (2) retention of the carrier due to compromise lymphatic drainage. With these two observations, the concept of enhancing permeability and retention (EPR) effect was formed [128]. To further understand the basis of the EPR effect, we must first understand the pathophysiology of the tumor. Solid tumors grow at a rapid rate, and this comes with high nutrients and oxygen demand. Thus, new blood vessels and neovasculature were formed, and this is term as angiogenesis. These new blood vessels often exhibit disorganized course, irregular, discontinuous epithelium and structurally different from healthy vessels. Due to this, the nanoparticles can leak between the gaps and enter the tumor. This stage is referring to the enhanced permeability of the EPR effect. It should be noted that solid tumor has poor lymphatic drainage. Molecules smaller than 4 nm can diffuse back to the bloodstream, but the nanoparticles are impeded due to their larger particle size, thus retain in the solid tumor. This part refers to the retention of the EPR effect [128,129].\n\nFor MSNs to be used as a drug delivery agent through passive targeting, there are several parameters that must be controlled, which are the particle size, particle shape and surface properties. The particle size must be larger than the renal clearance level but small enough to be able to diffuse to the tumor cell through the leaky vessel, which is approximately between 50 nm to 300 nm. A previous study showed the non-spherical nanoparticles could reduce phagocytosis, which leads to longer circulation. However, it is difficult to conclude that particle size is the main variable as there are many techniques and materials used to produce MSNs. Therefore, particle size may not be the main parameters that need to be controlled to achieve a good EPR effect [129]. Surface properties of MSNs are the most important aspect for a good EPR effect. With surface modification, the MSNs",

            "text": "Tumors are heterogeneous by nature and various studies have shown that the EPR effect within tumors is also highly heterogeneous [11][12][13]. Heterogeneity is present among tumor models of different species, diverse tumor types of the same origin, tumors at different locations in the same patient, and even at different stages of the same tumor during its development [14][15][16]. Within a tumor, variations in the thickness and density of the extracellular matrix (ECM), uneven blood flow distribution, and disproportionate vessel permeability have been shown to affect the heterogeneity of the EPR effect [11,17]. These factors vary substantially among tumors and even within the same tumor over time. In addition, the physicochemical properties of a nanoscale drug carrier, such as size, shape, and elasticity, contribute to the heterogeneity of the EPR effect. Several studies have shown that the size, shape, and elasticity of nanomedicine carriers impacted extravasation from the vessel and retention in the tumor site, resulting in varied therapeutic efficacy [18][19][20]. However, it is critical to mention that our current understanding of the EPR effect is mostly based on animal data, especially from fast-growing xenograft models in mice, which have been used most to explain the EPR effect. Experimental data on EPR effectiveness in patients should be further accumulated for the successful clinical use of nanomedicine. \n\nConsequently, the delivery of an EPR-dependent nanomedicine can be further enhanced to maximize its therapeutic efficacy [21,22]. Although the benefits of nanomedicine in principle surpass the efficacy of standard therapeutics, its therapeutic efficacy is not always satisfactory because if it is largely influenced by the heterogeneity of the intensity of the EPR effect [23][24][25]. This unsatisfactory therapeutic outcome in mice and humans requires novel approaches to improve the EPR effect by additional different strategies (Figure 1).",

            "text": "An important observation leading to the EPR effect's characterization was that macromolecules and lipids selectively permeate the tumor vasculature, remaining in the tumor interstitium for a considerable time [45]. This fact is related to the enhanced vascular permeability of solid tumors, thus facilitating the transport of macromolecules [46]. The discovery of the EPR effect revolutionized the area of nanomedicine, and since the group of Maeda published the first anticancer nanomedicine based on the EPR concept [47,48], many researchers have proposed new EPR-based anticancer nanosized platforms [46,49,50]. The EPR effect is based on the molecular size, with particles larger than 40 kDa showing a prolonged circulatory half-life and a higher area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) [51]. Macromolecules larger than 40 kDa are above the renal filtration threshold, limiting clearance, and accumulating in tumor tissue for an extended period [52]. \n\nInterestingly, the size, shape, and surface characteristics are essential to alter particle biodistribution and tumor retention [53]. Furthermore, several other factors have been proposed to influence the EPR effect, which can be useful in clinics [46]. Although the EPR effect created new expectations for the development of selective anticancer agents, translation to clinics does not go at the same pace. Several factors contributed to the slow clinical application of nanomedicines, including the particle's physicochemical characteristics, which should consider the factors that would influence its intracellular internalization, its unspecific interaction with the ECM, its recognition by the reticuloendothelial system (RES), and its biocompatibility and release rate. Tumor tissues present significant heterogeneity, i.e., diverse tumor types of various sizes and with different vascular abnormalities [50,54], which contributes to affecting EPR effect-based nanomedicine efficiency.",

            "text": "Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) Effect: Tumor cells, in a frantic attempt to mitigate the circumstance of limited diffusion, which negatively influences nutrient supply, oxygen supply and waste removal, engage in neoangiogenesis to step up vasculature. In order to avoid the imminent consequences of hypoxia, ischemia and toxicity, this process seems to occur very quickly and as a result, the contributions of the angiogenic regulators are largely excluded. This gives rise to highly disorganized and fenestrated tumor vessels, with discontinued endothelial linings and undesirable permeability to particles of up to 700 nm in diameter [63,64]. This pathologically orchestrated phenomenon is referred to as enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect [65] (Figure 2). Maeda et al. conceptualized and clearly demonstrated how angiogenic flaws associated with rapid tumor growth promoted site-specific accumulation and retention of nanoparticle-drug conjugates at the tumor site [65,66]. Taking advantage of the pressure gradient and leaky vessels at the tumor site, the nanoparticle-based drug accumulates at the tumor site, extravasates into the tumor microenvironment, and prolongs the release of therapeutic agents within the tumor with a resultant improvement in the treatment outcome. This emerged a land slide achievement in the field of nanomedicine and widened the scope of nanoparticle-based drug delivery via passive targeting such that new nanodrug formulations received approval for the treatment of other disease conditions such as fungal infection, hepatitis A, multiple sclerosis and end stage renal disease [67]. However, in order to maximize the advantages offered by EPR in the passive delivery of drugs, the size and surface properties of the nanocarrier must be controlled to avoid uptake by the reticuloendothelial system (RES) as previously described. The ideal size range to benefit from the EPR effect is between 10 to 200 nm as particles that are too small would be cleared by the kidneys, preventing accumulation into the tumor site, and particles that are too large will not adequately penetrate the tumor vasculature and interstitial space.",

            "text": "Before permission for phase I clinical investigation is granted, detailed and accurate preclinical results on the efficacy and safety of advanced nanomedicine candidates are required. Unfortunately, despite the promising results obtained in preclinical experiments, most nanomedicine candidates always fail in the clinical trials and result in a low success rate, demonstrating a poor connection of preclinical studies to clinical outcomes. This is because the comprehension of nanoparticle behavior in vivo is based on the data on animal models in preclinical experiments [9]. However, any preclinical efficacy in animal models may not be consistent with the human outcome because of the differences of species-dependent physiological and scaling parameters, including plasma composition, osmotic pressure, blood supply, immune responses, etc., as well as the differentiation in pathological process on experimental animals. Therefore, it is essential to understand the missing relationship between preclinical and clinical models fully. For example, despite the extensive observation of the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect in the xenografted tumor on an animal model, its availability in human solid tumor remains to be unproven, which is widely suspected as the key cause of the failure of tumor-targeting nanomedicines in clinical translation. For this purpose, Ding et al. investigated the EPR effect in the human renal solid tumors using an ex vivo perfusion model via X-ray computed tomography [10]. They confirmed that 87.8% of the human renal tumor possessed a considerable EPR effect, which 1 Laboratory of Biomaterials and Translational Medicine, Center for Nanomedicine, The Third Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, 600 Tianhe Road, Guangzhou 510630, P. R. China was well correlated with that in rabbit xenografted tumor. Thus, this work closely connects the EPR effect between the human solid tumor and the animal model.\n\nThe development of animal-based disease models with more similarities to the human pathological mechanism is another solution to establish the correlation between human trials and preclinical investigations. To date, some preclinical models that more perfectly present cancer features, like a patient-derived orthotopic xenograft using cancer tissues and patient-derived three-dimensional organoids, are reported with",

Status of the 'EPR effect' and clinical relevance\n\nThe initial success in cancer nanomedicine was fueled by the concept of enhanced permeability and retention (EPR effect) observed in pre-clinical models. 14 EPR has been questioned and discussed critically 15 and this section will only highlight brie\ue104y some latest observations. A leaky vasculature due to neovascularization, wider fenestrated endothelium, poor perfusion and poor lymphatic drainage is thought to be the driver for enhanced extravasation and sequestration of NPs in the tumour architecture. 16,17 EPR has dominated the literature on cancer nanomedicine as the primary reason for the efficacy of NPs. However, blatant misuse of this concept to claim therapeutic superiority has been at the epicenter of the current debate surrounding the efficiency of nanomedicine. 7,18 The main criticism against the EPR effect is that the success of pre-clinical effects could not be translated into clinically signi\ue103cant efficacy. The lack of EPR effect has been attributed to a large inter-and intra-individual heterogeneity in the tumour vasculature which is highly variable at different stages of tumorogenesis and depends on the tumour type. 19 The difference in tumor vascular permeability which is related to poor diffusion and penetration of NPs between a xenogra\ue09d model and a clinical tumor has been claimed as the reason for poor clinical translation",

            "text": "Such physical characteristics are likely advantageous to the nanoparticles in exploiting the enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) effect associated with solid tumors. Passively targeted nanoparticles enter through leaky vasculature of the solid tumors and are retained in the tumor tissue for extended periods of time due to impaired lymphatic flow. This unique microphysiology of tumors is exploited by many FDA-approved nanoformulations such as Doxil and Abraxane. In solid tumors, such as lung cancer, the EPR effect plays an important role in determining the efficacy of the nanoparticle-based drug delivery system [72]. The presence of a highly fenestrated blood vasculature in the tumor facilitates the EPR effect allowing the enhanced entry of colloidal nanoparticles into the tumor (Figure 2). Additionally, the poor lymphatic flow in the tumor tissue adds to this effect and results in enhanced retention of nanoparticles within the tumor site. In contrast to tumor tissues, the blood vasculature in normal tissues is intact and less permeable attenuating the uptake of nanoparticles by normal tissues. Furthermore, the size, shape, and surface properties of nanoparticles are critically important for passive targeting of solid tumors. The EPR effect usually applies to particles that are less than 200 nm in size. However, particles less than 50 nm in size frequently undergo extravasation from the tumor through the fenestrations and are thus less likely to be retained in the tumor tissue for extended periods of time. Moreover, active targeting of nanoparticles is accomplished by decorating the surface of the nanoparticle with specific ligands to promote the binding and interaction with overexpressed protein receptors on cancer cell surfaces. This approach leads to preferential binding, uptake, and intracellular accumulation of the drug or gene in the targeted cells. However, the overall tumor accumulation and therapeutic effect of targeted nanoparticles may be principally controlled by the EPR effect [73]. \n\nFabrication of polymeric nanoparticles with uniform and sub-200 nm size requires critical control over each and every step in the synthesis procedure, which is always challenging.",

They are able to attract the blood vessels to provide nutrition and oxygen, which will boost angiogenesis. In addition, tumors have a poor lymphatic drainage system that leads to the variable retention rate produced by high interstitial pressure. Due to these merits, nanomedicines often easily leak out of the blood vessel and enter the actual tumor tissues 27 .

            "text": "A central paradigm behind intensive research on cancer nanomedicines has been the concept of preferential extravasation and the accumulation of nanoparticles within the tumor interstitium, a phenomenon described as the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect [78]. This concept is justified by the observation that the inter-endothelial gaps in the tumor blood vessels formed during disorganized angiogenesis have a range of up to 2000 nm [79]. In addition, the EPR effect also relates to the findings that solid tumours tend to have a deficient functional intratumoral lymphatic system to remove extravasated nanoparticles [80]. Therefore, scientists are exploiting the EPR effect in the design of nanoparticles to induce passive transport and the accumulation of drugs in the tumor. Studies have reported that up to 10-15% of injected nanoparticles accumulate at the tumor site in vivo, as compared to 0.1% of the injected free drug, which may be attributed to the EPR effect [81,82].\n\nHowever, this predominant concept is being increasingly challenged by the nanotechnology community recently due to the poor clinical translation of nanomedicines after three decades of research [83]. A recent study addressed this question by performing imaging techniques and computational analysis to study the transport mechanism of nanoparticles into solid tumors. The study found that the frequency of inter-endothelial gaps is far less abundant to account for the nanoparticle accumulation in the tumor. The study reported that nanoparticles enter tumors mainly through active transcytosis by endothelial cells [84]. Furthermore, a meta-analysis of preclinical studies published over the past ten years revealed that only a median of 0.7% of nanoparticles' injected dose (% ID) reaches the tumors in mice [82]. However, it is important to recognize the limitations of these studies and exercise caution in drawing general conclusions that de-emphasize the EPR effect, as the study by Sindhwani and colleagues only studied the extravasation of one type of nanoparticle at three sizes (15 nm, 50 nm and 100 nm of colloidal gold). Besides, Wilhelm and colleagues evaluated the effectiveness of nanomedicines based on",

            "text": "It is important for cancer cells to induce angiogenesis in terms of nutrient and oxygen supply, the elimination of waste products, invasion, and metastasis. However, since a vascularization suddenly advances at the cancer sites under a nonphysiological condition, it is well recognized that the blood vessels in the cancer environment are fragile and the wall is highly permeable. Enhanced permeation and retention effect (EPR effect) is a concept to symbolize this condition of cancer blood vessels [60]. Based on the EPR effect concept, a positive targeting of micelles containing anticancer drug to cancer has been reported [61,62]. Thus, there are some structural and functional differences between the cancer and normal blood vessels. To study cancer characteristics or therapeutic efficacy, the blood vessel properties and the cancer-endothelial cell interaction are important to consider. Some research has been reported to demonstrate that tumor endothelial cells (TEC) differ from normal endothelial cells in properties, such as the cell proliferation, the gene expression, the response to growth factors, or migration [63,64]. High metastatic tumor-derived TEC (HM-TEC) and low metastatic tumor-derived TEC (LM-TEC) can be isolated from mice. It is demonstrated that the secretion levels of VEGF, MMP-2, MMP-9, and SDF-1 from HM-TEC are higher than from that of LM-TEC [60,65]. It is reported that coculture with endothelial cells facilitates the in vitro culture of cancer cells [66].",

            "text": "The EPR Effect. Passive targeting is a drug delivery approach in which drugs are delivered to the targeted site by conjugating with polymer which releases the drug outside the targeted site due to altered environmental conditions (Figure 6(a)). Tumors and many inflamed areas of body have hyperpermeable vasculature and poor lymphatic drainage which passively provides increased retention of macromolecules into tumor and inflamed area of body [27][28][29][30]. This phenomenon is called enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect [27]. It constitutes one of the practical carrier-based anticancer drug delivery strategies. EPR effect is primarily utilized for passive targeting due to accumulation of prodrug into tumor or inflamed area. Low molecular drugs covalently coupled with high-molecular-weight carriers are inefficiently eliminated due to hampered lymphatic drainage and therefore accumulate in tumors. While EPR effect enhances the passive targeting ability due to higher accumulation rate of drug in tumor and subsequently due to accumulation, prodrug slowly releases drug molecules which provide high bioavailability and low systemic toxicity [30]. \n\nPassive accumulation of macromolecules such as PEG and other nanoparticles in solid tumors is a phenomenon which was probably overlooked for several years as a potential biological target for tumor-selective drug delivery. Ara-C) was covalently linked to varying molecular weight -OH terminal PEGs through an amino acid spacer in order to improve the in vivo stability and blood residence time (reproduced from [22]). \n\nThe existence of the EPR effect was experimentally confirmed by David et al., for macromolecular anticancer drug delivery systems [31]. Furthermore, passive targeting increases the concentration of the conjugate in the tumor environment and therefore \"passively\" forces the polymeric drug to enter the cells by means of the concentration gradient between the intracellular and extracellular spaces and therefore is not very efficient. The more efficient way to provide targeting is by \"active targeting\" [32].",

            "text": "Globally, cancer is the leading cause of death in advanced countries. Its incidence increases with the aging of the population, and it is considered the biggest limit to the expectancy of life duration in the 21st century, as globally, mortality rates determined by cancer are increasing [1]. \n\nSurgical treatment with tumor removal is the best approach, but its success depends on early diagnosis and the absence of metastases. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy represent further tools available against cancer. However, conventional chemotherapy has some limits, mainly represented by the lack of tumor selectivity. Therefore, there is the need to develop new tools able to target tumors with high selectivity, to improve early diagnostics and the efficacy of anticancer drugs and reduce drug toxicity [2]. \n\nIn 1986, Maeda and Matsumura discovered the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, and this was the starting point of many studies about the possible use of nanomedicines in cancer chemotherapy [3,4]. The EPR effect is a phenomenon observed in solid tumors determined by the peculiar anatomical and physio-pathological characteristics constituted by fenestrated tumor vasculature and reduced lymphatic recovery [5]. When nanomedicines are administered systemically, the hyperpermeable tumor vasculature determines their leaking from the tumor blood vessels into the tumor interstitium, a phenomenon that does not occur in healthy vessels, while poor tumor lymphatic drainage contributes to enhanced retention and accumulation of nanoparticles [6]. This phenomenon is classified as a form of passive targeting of nanoparticles into the tumor body [6,7] and it has been the starting point for the use of nanocarriers in EPR-based tumor targeting [8]. Over the years, research has been concentrated on the development of cancer nanomedicines, resulting in thousands of publications [9]. Different kinds of nanomedicines can be prepared, such as polymeric [7,[10][11][12][13][14][15] and dendrimeric [16,17] nanoparticles, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) [18][19][20], liposomes [20], and nanomicelles [21].",

            "text": "Relevant work had been pioneered by Maeda et al., in which they applied the nitric oxide donor Lipiodol \u00ae through the arterial catheter to the tumor feeding artery with reported success in the management of clinically advanced cases of primary and secondary liver tumors [70]. This early experience proved that in order to selectively utilize a vasodilating agent to improve the EPR effect, the vasodilation needs to be restricted to the blood supply in the close vicinity of the tumor tissues, otherwise widespread vasodilation can enhance the delivery of the nanoconstructs to other off-target tissues and induce systemic hypotension. Greish et al. demonstrated that using sildenafil in conjunction with DOX increased the concentration of the anticancer drug in tumor tissues by 2.7 folds, and eventually resulted in 4.7 folds improved anticancer activity against the 4T1 breast cancer in mice. This work suggests a positive effect of PDE5 inhibitors to further augment enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect on EPR effect [43]. A relevant study by Black et al. demonstrated the effect of PDE5 inhibitors on enhancing tumor vascular permeability in the brain tumor model of 9L gliosarcoma-bearing in rats. Sildenafil administration increased the tumor capillary permeability in comparison to the normal brain capillaries, which showed no significant increase in vascular permeability. Additionally, the study proved a synergistic effect of the use of anthracycline chemotherapy combined with the sildenafil and further improved the survival by nearly twofold longer than the group treated with the chemotherapeutic agent alone [71]. Another work by Zhang et al. provided further direct evidence of the potential of PDE 5 inhibitors in augmenting EPR-mediated anticancer chemotherapy in vivo. In their study, the team employed a combined micelle incorporating both cisplatin and sildenafil. The team proposed that tumor acidity can preferentially release the PDE5 inhibitor from the micelle, further augmenting its concentration in tumor tissues.",

            "text": "These irregularities contribute to an inadequate blood supply of the tumor, creating a hypoxic and acidic milieu. They also account for the enhanced permeability component of the EPR effect and allow extravasation of macromolecules and particles up to \u223c400 nm in size due to increased leakiness (Gerlowski and Jain, 1986;Yuan et al., 1995), but depending on the tumor type, this cutoff can be larger or smaller (Hobbs et al., 1998). \n\nThe second component, the enhanced retention, is a consequence of the aberrant lymphatic architecture (Stacker et al., 2014). Although metastatic spread frequently occurs by means of lymphatic dissemination, this appears to be mediated by lymphatic vessels in the periphery of the tumor mass, whereas internal vessels tend to collapse under the high tissue pressure (Leu et al., 2000;Padera et al., 2002). Consequently, tissue homeostasis within tumors is disrupted, and previously extravasated particles are not efficiently funneled back into the blood via lymphogenic transport through the ductus thoracicus (Noguchi et al., 1998). \n\nAlthough the effects mentioned above were initially described in a static context, the tumor vasculature and the EPR effect appear to be subject to dynamic changes, as vents within the vessels open transiently to allow efflux of fluid into the surrounding tissues (Matsumoto et al., 2016). For larger particles, these events, termed eruptions, may be the only chance to leave the vessel lumen, and therefore allow them fewer opportunities to re-enter the circulation the way they left it, resulting in their entrapment (Ngoune et al., 2016). \n\nIn sum, both aspects (enhanced permeability and enhanced retention) can result in accumulation of particles, given sufficiently long circulation times of the particles in question for this process to take place.",

            "text": "It is generally accepted that solid tumors are usually highly heterogeneous, with significant differences in the vascular system depending on tumor type and stage of growth (Pe'er et al., 2021). It is worth noting that tumor tissues generally lack functional lymphatic vessels and there is a large gap between endothelial cells, which leads to the easy exosmosis or retention of macromolecules. This unique pathophysiological property promotes the selective accumulation of nanoparticles in tumor tissues, a phenomenon defined as enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) (Maeda et al., 2000). The passive targeting strategy based on the EPR effect can significantly improve the specific distribution of drugs in tumor tissues and minimize the toxic effect on normal tissues through the rational design of nanocarriers (such as liposomes, polymer nanoparticles, etc.). \n\nYuan et al. adopted silk fibroin (SF) as the carrier material of the drug delivery system, and successfully constructed a dual-drug coloaded hydrogel system (Yuan et al., 2025). The team combined 5-FU in SF solution with curcumin dissolved in acetone solvent through precise process control to produce a nanoparticle drug delivery system with a particle size distribution ranging from 77.87 nm to 299.22 nm. It is worth noting that this composite nanosphere exhibits a significant EPR effect, which enables it to effectively enrich solid tumor tissue through a passive targeting mechanism, thus enhancing tumor therapy. \n\nIn view of the complex variability and potential toxicity of nanocarriers, Ji and other researchers have carried out innovative research based on natural small molecules (Ji et al., 2022) (Figure 3A). They found that honokiol (HK) can self-assemble through intermolecular hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions to form stable NPs. This self-assembled system based on natural ingredients exhibits unique tumor-targeting properties: First, HK NPs can selectively accumulate at the tumor site thanks to the EPR effect; Subsequently, they enter the cell through endocytosis of tumor cells.",

            "text": "A notable increase in the plasma half-life of doxorubicin was obtained by encapsulating the drug in liposomes (Caelyx \u00ae /Doxil \u00ae ) [53] and by modifying the surface with polyethylene glycol (PEG) to decrease aggregation and opsonization reducing mononuclear phagocyte system uptake (stealth liposomes) [54,55]. Extended systemic circulation allows for these nanomedicines to accumulate in the tumor site by passive targeting due to its pathophysiological characteristics. The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect observed in tumors versus healthy tissues and first described by Matsumura and Maeda in 1986 [56] is a result of leaky vasculature and poor vessel perfusion [57][58][59][60]. The extent of the EPR effect depends not only on the growth of a chaotic vasculature but also on the tumor microenvironment [59]. The low or absent functional lymphatic vessels that result in high interstitial fluid pressure, the presence of deregulated stromal cells, and abnormal and overexpressed extracellular matrix made of a cross-linked network of hyaluronic acid, elastin fibers, collagen, and proteoglycans can reduce the diffusion of the nanodrugs in the interstitium. All these factors affect the even distribution and accumulation of nanoparticles in the tumor, leading to a clinical outcome that is highly heterogeneous [61][62][63]. Despite the possibility of functionalizing the nanoparticles to target over-expressed receptors (e.g., VEGF, EGFR, and HER2) [64,65], it has been reported in a meta-analysis by Wilhelm et al. that only 0.7% of the administered therapeutics can be targeted to the solid tumor solely by the EPR effect [66,67].",

            "text": "Nanotechnology has been shown to circumvent many limitations of traditional chemotherapy to an extent and serves as a valuable tool for improving overall cancer treatment outcomes. Generally, drug molecules are dissolved, adsorbed, entrapped, encapsulated, or attached to nanomatrices. Due to their nanoscale dimensions (typically <500 nm) and large surface-area-to-volume ratios, nanocarriers can favorably influence the fundamental properties and biological activity of their payloads [5]. Additionally, nanoparticles can enhance the bioavailability of medication with poor aqueous solubility while offering tumor-selective accumulation of their payloads. Most importantly, nanoformulations promote preferential tumor accumulation of chemotherapeutic agents, enhancing therapeutic efficacy while reducing systemic toxicity. \n\nThe use of nanocarriers for cancer therapy primarily relies on enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effects first observed by Matsumura and Maeda in 1986 [6]. The EPR effects depend on high vascular permeability and reduced lymphatic outflow in solid tumors to enable passive targeting and long-term retention of nanoparticles at the tumor site (Figure 1A). Consequently, nanomedicines significantly improve therapeutic outcomes while minimizing the dose-dependent toxicity of chemotherapeutic agents. Over the years, EPR effects have become the backbone of nanocarrier-based cancer therapy and have led to the approval of several nanomedicines [7]. Many other nanocarrier-based therapies, such as ABI-009 (albumin-bound rapamycin nanoparticles) [8], CPX-351 (cytarabine and daunorubicin encapsulated liposomes) [9], and DoceAqualip (nanosomal docetaxel lipid suspension) [10], have shown promising anticancer efficacy in clinical trials. \n\nAlthough passive targeting-based nanomedicines have shown great enthusiasm in cancer therapy, the major disadvantages of EPR-based formulations include their nonspecific distribution, insufficient tumor accumulation, and intra-and inter-tumoral as well as inter-individual heterogeneity.",

            "text": "Simple Summary Electroporation-based therapies (reversible electroporation, irreversible electroporation, electrochemotherapy) are used for the selective treatment of deep-seated tumors. The combination of the structural modifications of the lipid bilayer of cell membranes, due to the application of electrical pulses in the targeted tissue, with the concomitant systemic (intravenous) administration of drugs can be considered as a sort of bridge between local-regional and systemic treatments. A possible further application of these techniques can be envisaged in their use as enhancers of the so-called \u201cenhanced permeability and retention\u201d effect. The intratumoral uptake of drug-loaded nanocarriers concomitant with the application of electric pulses in the target tumor is a new scenario worthy of attention and can represent a potential new frontier for drug delivery in oncology. Abstract Surgical resection is the gold standard for the treatment of many kinds of tumor, but its success depends on the early diagnosis and the absence of metastases. However, many deep-seated tumors (liver, pancreas, for example) are often unresectable at the time of diagnosis. Chemotherapies and radiotherapies are a second line for cancer treatment. The \u201cenhanced permeability and retention\u201d (EPR) effect is believed to play a fundamental role in the passive uptake of drug-loaded nanocarriers, for example polymeric nanoparticles, in deep-seated tumors. However, criticisms of the EPR effect were recently raised, particularly in advanced human cancers: obstructed blood vessels and suppressed blood flow determine a heterogeneity of the EPR effect, with negative consequences on nanocarrier accumulation, retention, and intratumoral distribution. Therefore, to improve the nanomedicine uptake, there is a strong need for \u201cEPR enhancers\u201d. Electrochemotherapy represents an important tool for the treatment of deep-seated tumors, usually combined with the systemic (intravenous) administration of anticancer drugs, such as bleomycin or cisplatin. A possible new strategy, worthy of investigation, could be the use of this technique as an \u201cEPR enhancer\u201d of a target tumor, combined",

            "text": "Alongside the MPS, both passive and active targeting play a key role in assisting NP delivery to tumor sites as depicted in Figure 2. Large fenestrae of 100-200 nm (increases to 400-600 nm in some liver diseases) and an absence of an organized basement membrane are features of the liver sinusoids (Aird, 2007). Hence they are able to facilitate passive liver targeting through the widely reported EPR effect. This effectively builds up a high local concentration of NPs in the perisinusoidal space of Disse, whereby diffusion towards the malignant tumor cells can occur. Since the EPR effect is evident within tumors, it results in the preferential uptake and retention of NPs (Maeda, Wu, Sawa, Matsumura, & Hori, 2000). Excessive proangiogenic signaling within the tumor microenvironment leads collectively to the production of immature blood vessels that are heterogeneous, poorly perfused and disorganized. Leakage results from large inter-endothelial cell junctions, favoring the retention of NPs. These mechanistic features underpin the EPR effect and have been greatly exploited as a strategy to passively deliver NPs into tumors. It was established that NK012, a polymeric micelle formulation of SN-38, enhances its antitumor activity through the EPR effect. By using a VEGF-secreting tumor model, significantly enhanced accumulation of NK012 within tumors was demonstrated, augmented by the hypervascularity and hyperpermeability induced by VEGF (Koizumi et al., 2006). Similarly, in a Phase II clinical trial the accumulation of the liposome, CPX-1, in CRC lesions was attributed to EPR-based accumulation (Batist et al., 2008;Goel et al., 2011;Golombek et al., 2018). Despite the benefits of passive targeting, major limitations still exist. Heterogeneity within tumors and between the primary and metastatic tumors, often causes the nonuniform delivery of NPs (Adua et al., 2017).",

The peculiar features of these tissues promote the high permeability of the blood vessels and the accumulation of the colloidal systems in the tumor by means of the so-called enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect [58,59] (Figure 2). Cancer treatment can follow two main targeting strategies, i.e., passive and active approaches [60]. The first represents the ability of particles characterized by suitable sizes to accumulate in the tumor tissues by way of the previously described EPR effect. This phenomenon is a non-selective process that occurs thanks to the aforementioned, peculiar morphology of the neo-vessels and endothelial tissues of the tumor combined with the reduced activity of the lymphatic system [61]. Active targeting is achieved by the linkage of specific molecules onto the surfaces of the nanosystems in order to promote their interaction with specific receptors that are over-expressed in the tumor tissue/cells (for example transferrin, folate, hormones, hyaluronic acid, etc.) [62,63].",

Interpersonal and intra-, as well as inter-tumoral heterogeneity, is a major difficulty in EPR drug delivery studies. Since drug accumulation through EPR effect in the tumor may not be enough to obtain therapeutic effect, penetration, internalization, effective drug delivery, and cytoplasmic release are crucial for improvements with anticancer therapy. Actively targeted drug delivery systems have been highly useful for the treatment of hematological malignancies, whereas, for solid tumors, active targeting must rely on EPR-mediated accumulation in tumors. Quantification of the EPR-effect is thus necessary. To assess the EPR effect, the development of fast, quantitative EPR-imaging Active targeting can also be used as a complementary approach to EPR-mediated tumor targeting to enhance drug delivery, accumulation, and retention in tumors [174]. Finally, pharmacological and physical co-treatments, nanoparticle-based combination therapies, bio-inspired design of nanoparticles allowing tumor-selective drug release, advanced imaging techniques coupled with HTP computing technologies, and development of 3D-models of cells, better animal models, and organoids are necessary to improve the application and efficacy of EPR-targeted drug delivery for cancer therapy in both clinical and pre-clinical settings.",

            "text": "The mechanism that drives the high tumor uptake of L-PEG 2000 -DBCO and how this is facilitated by the DBCO moiety is not fully understood. For example, conjugation of L-PEG 2000 -DBCO with DV1-N3 peptides leads to diminished tumor uptake, similar to L-PEG 2000 , underscoring the key role of the DBCO moiety in driving high tumor uptake 12 . It is likely that the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect contributes to enhanced tumor uptake. Long circulation times allow the liposome to penetrate preferentially into tumor tissue through permeable tumor vasculature and to remain in the tumor bed through impaired www.nature.com/scientificreports/ lymphatic drainage 25 . However, the EPR effect alone was reported to offer less than a twofold increase in nanodrug delivery 25,26 . Further studies of DBCO-labeled liposomes will be needed to help unravel the mechanism of high accumulation of L-PEG 2000 -DBCO in tumor tissues and low accumulation in non-target tissues that ordinarily mediate therapeutic toxicity. Enhanced chemical modifications of DBCO-labelled liposomes may lead to enhanced formulations with improved tumor specificity. These studies are ongoing in our laboratory and will be reported in future publications. In summary, the liposome surface may significantly influence in vitro cellular uptake and in vivo penetration into tumor tissues while minimizing penetration into off-target tissues. We are optimistic that our findings will pave the way for the design of next generation liposomes for efficient delivery of molecular imaging and imageguided probes as well as anti-cancer therapeutics.",

            "text": "Diseased tissues are frequently characterized by the gaps between endothelial cells. These gaps increase endothelial permittivity to large particles, such as NPs, while having no effect on the extravasation of small molecules [182]. Subsequent residence time of NPs within the diseased tissue is theoretically increased, as compared to the small molecules based on NP size. This phenomenon, referred to as the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, remains the driving force for a significant number of NP applications, since its discovery in the 1980s [183]. Passive targeting effectiveness is primarily influenced by MSN size, shape, and surface charge [184]. While preclinical evidence supporting the efficacy of the EPR effect is vast, clinical studies showed that passively targeted NPs are not more effective than lone molecules [185][186][187][188]. The differences in efficacy in preclinical animal models and human subjects are thought to be the results of innate differences in physiology and tumor features. Irregular or lack of blood flow in solid tumor bodies along with passive targeting inability to target metastatic tumor cells are additional sources of EPR ineffectiveness [188]. While MSNs did not undergo clinical trials to assess their passive targeting effectiveness in humans, current evidence from other NP formulations suggest that active targeting is a better strategy.",

            "text": "Cancer is a leading cause of mortality, with 606,520 cancer-related deaths projected to occur in the United States in 2020 [1]. Despite recent advances in the fields of cancer diagnosis and therapy, the path to curative therapies remains littered with significant hurdles that must be overcome. Current treatment options, including surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, are invasive, painful, and often ineffective and imprecise, which result in acute and chronic side effects that negatively impact the patient's overall well-being [2]. Since Paul Ehrlich promoted the concept of a \"magic bullet' in the early 1900s, researchers have attempted to develop targeted platforms that can distinguish between cancer cells and the trillions of healthy cells in the body, and deliver a therapeutic drug dose to cancer cells without harming healthy cells [3]. The integration of nanotechnology and targeted drug delivery has opened potential avenues to achieve this goal. With high surface area to volume ratios and unique physiochemical properties, the architecture of nanoparticles allows optimization for the delivery of various imaging and therapeutic agents [4]. \n\nTargeting of nanoparticles to tumor sites can be achieved by several general methods: passive, active, or through externally applied forces, as shown in Figure 1 [5]. In passive targeting, nanoparticles selectively accumulate at the tumor site via the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, a phenomenon utilized by several clinically-approved Ivyspring International Publisher drug nanoformulations including Doxil TM and Abraxane TM [6]. It has been suggested that the EPR effect arises due to a leaky vasculature (having pores of 100 nm to 2 \u00b5m in diameter) and poor lymphatic drainage in the tumor -two distinctive characteristics of some neoplastic tissues not present in normal tissues [7]. While numerous studies have attributed increased tumor accumulation to the EPR effect, it should be noted that less than 1% of administered nanoparticles accumulate in solid tumors [8], and the vast majority accumulate in other organs -primarily the liver, spleen, and lungs [9].",

            "text": "Although chemotherapy nano-encapsulation \n\noften reduces some of the side-effects observed with the un-encapsulated drug [3,7], the impact on efficacy has been less clear in some cases [8][9][10][11]. Impressive efficacy has been achieved in recent trials for blood cancers such as acute myeloid leukemia [12], but findings in solid tumors have been more heterogeneous when comparing un-encapsulated and encapsulated formulations. This is especially problematic considering most FDA-approved TNP are indicated for solid tumors, including breast, ovarian, pancreatic, lung, and liver cancers. A meta-analysis of 14 clinical trials compared liposomal and conventional chemotherapy efficacy across >2,500 patients, finding no substantial difference in objective response, overall survival, and progression-freesurvival [8]. This clinical experience contrasts with most studies using animal tumor models, where TNP superiority is typically reported [8,13]. Consequently, these results raise the questions: what is driving heterogeneous patient response to TNP in solid cancers, and how can TNP clinical efficacy be better predicted? Beyond merely improving drug safety, TNP are thought to improve efficacy through the enhanced delivery to solid tumors. Due to their size and other physicochemical properties, NP may passively accumulate in tumor tissue due to a variety of factors that are collectively known as the \"enhanced permeability and retention\" (EPR) effect [14,15] or \"tumor cell endocytosis\" in earlier literature [16,17]. In principle, disrupted and leaky tumor endothelium, high amounts of tumor-associated phagocytic immune cells, and dysfunctional lymphatic drainage all may contribute to the EPR effect that governs TNP delivery. Most data describing large EPR effects come from rapidly progressing mouse models of cancer, and particularly subcutaneous xenografts. Yet it is evident that many tumors in the clinic exhibit more complex tissue architecture and thus diverse EPR behavior.",

            "text": "Drug delivery for tumor theranostics involves the extensive use of the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. Previously, various types of nanomedicines have been demonstrated to accumulate in solid tumors via the EPR effect. However, EPR is a highly variable phenomenon because of tumor heterogeneity, resulting in low drug delivery efficacy in clinical trials. Because ultrasonication using micro/nanobubbles as contrast agents can disrupt blood vessels and enhance the specific delivery of drugs, it is an effective approach to improve the EPR effect for the passive targeting of tumors. In this review, the basic thermal effect, acoustic streaming, and cavitation mechanisms of ultrasound, which are characteristics that can be utilized to enhance the EPR effect, are briefly introduced. Second, micro/nanobubble-enhanced ultrasound imaging is discussed to understand the validity and variability of the EPR effect. Third, because the tumor microenvironment is complicated owing to elevated interstitial fluid pressure and the deregulated extracellular matrix components, which may be unfavorable for the EPR effect, few new trends in smart bubble drug delivery systems, which may improve the accuracy of EPR-mediated passive drug targeting, are summarized. Finally, the challenging and major concerns that should be considered in the next generation of micro/nanobubble-contrast-enhanced ultrasound theranostics for EPR-mediated passive drug targeting are also discussed.",

            "text": "In recent times, nanomedicine delivery to tumors has attracted extensive attention in the field of tumor treatment (Allen and Cullis, 2004;Peer et al., 2007). The advantage of nanomedicines over free drugs is based on the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect (Fang et al., 2011;Maeda, 2012). The fundamental characteristics of EPR physiology are highly permeable tumor vessels allowing the enhanced permeability (EP) of large particles including proteins, macromolecules, liposomes, micelles, and other particles large enough to avoid renal clearance, into the tumor interstitium combined with impaired lymphatic drainage limiting clearance and causing enhanced retention (ER) of those extravasated particles. Both features result from the rapid growth of a tumor and collapse of the existing blood and lymph vessels in the limited interstitial space (Leu et al., 2000;Dreher et al., 2006). With EPR effect as the main principle for passive targeting strategy, nanomedicine delivery to tumors has achieved success to varying degrees. However, the clinical benefits of the three EPR-based Food and Drug Administration (FAD)-approved nanomedicines including pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil/Caelyx), liposomal daunorubicin (DaunoXome), and nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (Abraxane) for the treatment of solid tumors were demonstrated to be only modest (O'Brien et al., 2004;Gradishar et al., 2005;Jain and Stylianopoulos, 2010), posing considerable challenges for the clinical translation of new nanomedicines. Accumulating evidence revealed that EPRdependent drug delivery was always compromised by the tumor microenvironment including irregular vascular distribution, elevated tumor interstitial fluid pressure (IFP), poor blood flow, rich extracellular matrix (ECM) and abundant tumor stroma cells (Nichols and Bae, 2014). Delivery barriers posed by the tumor microenvironment are the main reasons responsible for the modest survival benefits of FDA-approved nanomedicines (Jain and Stylianopoulos, 2010).",

            "text": "In a growing solid tumor, the combination of hypoxic environment and inflammatory response leads to the up-regulation of angiogenic factors and down-regulation of angiogenic inhibitors, promoting the formation of new vessels. This process involves local removal of smooth muscle cells and degradation of basement membrane and extracellular matrix (ECM) by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). At the same time, the proliferation of tumor cells causes expansion of the microenvironment and generates local compressive forces [1]. Expansion increases the average spacing between vessels, reducing the supply of nutrients, and creating hypoxic regions in the tumor. The compressive forces generated by tumor growth leads to contraction of blood vessels that contributes to increased resistance to flow. Compressive forces on lymphatic vessels lead to poor lymphatic drainage and increased interstitial fluid pressure. This combination of biochemical and mechanical factors leads to an irregular vascular architecture, increased resistance to blood flow, poor perfusion, and increased permeability. The leakiness of the tumor vasculature is key for systemic delivery of anticancer drugs to a solid tumor, and is known as the Enhanced Permeation and Retention (EPR) effect (Fig 1A) [2,3]. In animal models, the cut-off size for extravasation from the tumor vasculature varies from 200 nm to 1.2 \u03bcm depending on the tumor type [4][5][6]. A diameter of about 200 nm is often considered an upper limit for successful drug delivery [7,8]. \n\nDespite its critical importance in cancer therapy, surprisingly little is known about the kinetics of the EPR effect. Here we present a model for the pharmacokinetics of a chemotherapeutic drug or nanomedicine that takes into account extravasation from circulation at the tumor site by the EPR effect and intravasation back into circulation. We use data from clinical trials of Doxil and doxorubicin to quantitatively assess the influence of the EPR effect on tumor uptake.",

            "text": "While this may appear to be low, nanomedicines have demonstrated substantially higher delivery efficiencies than most conventional chemotherapeutic formulations in relative terms [7,8]. It has been reported that the dense extracellular matrix, high interstitial fluid pressure, and non-uniform blood perfusion limit nanoparticle accumulation in solid tumors [7,9]. The preferential accumulation of drug-loaded nanoparticles in neoplastic tissues is referred to as passive targeting [9,10]. Passive targeting is facilitated by the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect [11], i.e., the mechanism by which high molecular weight drug carriers accumulate in the tumor microenvironment (TME) due to increased vascular permeability and the nanometer size of nanoparticles [12]. The TME also possesses impaired lymphatic drainage that prevents the efficient removal of these macromolecules or nanoparticles, thus enhancing their retention within neoplastic tissues [13][14][15]. \n\nThe concept of EPR originated from a landmark study in 1986 by Matsumura and Maeda on the mechanisms of the tumoritropic accumulation of proteins and chemotherapeutic agents [16]. In this study, an increase in the accumulation and uptake of a derivatized styrene-maleic acid polymer loaded with neocarzinostatin (SMANCS) was observed in tumor cells relative to the native neocarzinostatin. SMANCS has a molecular size of 16 kDa and can bind serum albumin (67 kDa) to become a larger molecule [17]. The superior accumulation of SMANCS in tumor tissues offered prolonged duration of action and increased therapeutic efficacy. The authors opined that EPR is made possible by an increased vascular permeability, a dysfunctional lymphatic drainage system, and the relative size of nanoparticles. They showed that very small molecules will traverse biological barriers easily, while larger molecules like nanoparticles may be filtered through highly vascularized and permeable barriers.",

The endothelial cell layer, lining the blood vessels, is thought to present a barrier to macromolecular drugs (20). Transendothelial transport of macromolecular drugs involves a phenomenon known as the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect in solid tumors. The EPR effect is observed for intravenously administered macromolecular anti-cancer drugs that escape renal clearance, due to their large molecular size (10-500 nm). They are mostly unable to pass the tight endothelial junctions of normal blood vessels, but can extravasate and then become trapped in the tumor vicinity (65). Unlike normal tissues that feature an organized vascular network, the blood vessel system in solid tumors is rather chaotic. The endothelial cell layers are poorly aligned (66) and elevated levels of vascular permeability factors generate \"leaky\" capillaries (65). It is therefore thought that transendothelial transport is not a critical limiting obstacle for large sized drugs.",

A major advantage of nanoscale DDS in cancer therapy is the EPR effect, which facilitates selectively accumulation of nanoscale particles and vesicles in tumors owing to their enhanced permeability and prolonged retention in tumor vasculature leakage. 29 Through the EPR effect, Exos minimize non-specific binding to non-targeted sites while concentrating drugs at tumor sites.

            "text": "Passive targeting consists in the transport of nanocarriers through leaky tumor capillary endothelium into the tumor interstitial space [5]. The underlying mechanism, which makes passive targeting possible, is the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. \n\nIt was observed that certain circumstances, such as inflammation/hypoxia, tumors, or infarcts, can determine an enhanced permeability of the endothelial lining of the blood vessel wall compared with the normal state of the tissue [6]. When reaching a given size, a tumor can no longer rely on the normal vasculature present in its vicinity to provide all the oxygen supply needed for its further proliferation. Therefore, as oxygen-deprived cells start to die, they secrete growth factors that promote the formation of new blood vessels from the surrounding capillaries, process known as angiogenesis [7]. These newly formed irregular blood vessels lack the basal membrane of normal vascular structures, thus presenting a discontinuous epithelium, which allows particles, such as nanocarriers (in the size range of 20-200 nm), to extravasate and accumulate inside the interstitial space [8]. Following permeation into the tumor, the enhanced accumulation of nanocarriers in the tumor microenvironment is favored by the poor lymphatic drainage in the tissue. In tumors, the lymphatic function is defective, resulting in minimal uptake of the interstitial fluid. Therefore, nanocarriers that have reached the perivascular space are not cleared efficiently and accumulate in the tumor interstitium [7]. This spontaneous accumulation or \"passive\" targeting is currently known as the EPR effect [9]. Utilization of the EPR effect is therefore an effective strategy for targeting nanopreparations, such as liposomes, to the site of a tumor and has been extensively documented using various tumor types and animal models, since its early discovery in 1980s by Matsumura and Maeda [10,11].",

            "text": "It was discovered that HPMA-based copolymers (as well as other macromolecules) are preferentially accumulated in tumor tissue due to the leaky and permeable tumor vascular system. This phenomenon is known as the so-called Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) effect [10]. Preferably, the EPR effect in combination with efficient CPPs bound to the polymer chain could enhance internalization of some anti-tumor drugs into the malignant cells [11,12]. In some therapeutic applications, the internalization of the drug into the cancer cells is a prerequisite to its activity. e.g., in photodynamic therapy, the development of singlet oxygen inside the target cell is a crucial parameter for the high efficacy of tumor cell destruction [13]; therefore, a polymer carrier bearing both CPP and a photosensitizer could substantially improve the outcome of the therapy. \n\nIn this work, an HPMA-based copolymer was used as a carrier of both a fluorescent label and a CPP as a cell uptake enhancer. The presented system can be used either directly as a diagnostic probe for tumor imaging or even for fluorescence-guided surgery; eventually, upon replacement of the fluorophore by an anticancer drug it might be utilized as a polymer therapeutic system with enhanced accumulation in solid tumors and with improved penetration into the cancer cells.",

Here, we show that obstructive metastatic foci in lung arterioles decrease the pulmonary vascular network. To generate a mouse model of lung metastasis activation, luciferase-expressing tumor cells were inoculated into the subiliac lymph node (SiLN) of an MXH10/Mo-lpr/lpr mouse, and metastatic tumor cells in the lungs were activated by SiLN resection. Activation of metastases was monitored by in vivo bioluminescence imaging. Pulmonary blood vessel characteristics were analyzed using ex vivo micro-computed tomography. The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect in neovasculature after tumor cell activation was evaluated from the accumulation of intravenously injected indocyanine green (ICG) liposomes. Metastatic foci in lung arterioles were investigated histologically. Micro-computed tomography revealed decreases in pulmonary blood vessel length, volume and number of branching nodes during the early stage of metastasis caused by metastatic foci. ICG liposome accumulation by the EPR effect was not detected. Histology identified metastatic foci in lung arterioles. The lack of an EPR effect after the formation of metastatic foci in lung arterioles makes conventional systemic chemotherapy ineffective for lung metastasis. Thus, alternative therapeutic methods of drug delivery are needed.",

Some of these factors include CXCL12, IL3, IL6, IL8, lysyl oxidase, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, transforming growth factor \u03b2, among others [97]. TECs express receptors such as CXCR7, endoglin, integrins (e.g., \u03b1v integrins), and VEGFR2. Integrins, endoglin, and VEGFR2 have been used in antiangiogenic nanodrug therapies and are still in development [135]. Using these TEC-specific nanodrugs indicates a shift into a regime of antiangiogenic drugs with less off-target effects. \n\nThe enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect is a feature of tumors that allows the delivery and retention of macromolecular drugs due to the leakiness of blood vessels and the lack of adequate drainage through the lymphatics [136]. The contribution of the abnormal tumor vasculature to the EPR effect and its role in delivery of nanoparticles have been well documented. Reduced pericyte coverage that renders the interendothelial barriers accessible is one such feature of the abnormal vasculature that enhances the EPR effect. The tumor endothelium facilitates the detachment of pericytes by expressing angiopoietin 2 (Ang2); it has been reported that Ang2 antagonizes the binding of Ang1 to the Tie2 receptors on TECs [137]. TEC heterogeneity [97] is an unexplored feature of TECs that may contribute significantly to the EPR effect in tumors. TECs originating from highly metastatic tumors express high levels of VEGF and VEGFR2 [96], and these features can be advantageous to the EPR effect because they promote chaotic blood vessel formation. In addition, the hyperglycolytic metabolism of TECs has been shown to decrease the expression of VE-cadherin in vessels, leading to the formation of abnormal blood vessels.",

            "text": "Delivery of anticancer drugs to the target tissue is one of the main tasks to be solved. NPs loaded with the drug are transported in the body by two mechanisms: passive and active targeting. Passive targeting to solid tumors can be achieved through the enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR effect), as first described in the 1980s [13,14]. Pathological, pharmacological, and biochemical studies have shown that a solid tumor usually has such pathophysiological characteristics as hypervascularization, incomplete vascular architecture, and secretion of vascular permeability factors that stimulate extravasation and immaturity of lymphatic capillaries [15]. The tumor vasculature is characterized by a high proportion of proliferating endothelial cells, increased tortuosity, pericyte deficiency, and the formation of an atypical membrane. All this leads to rapid vascularization of the tumor, which is necessary to provide it with oxygen and nutrients and further proliferation. These characteristics make tumor blood vessels permeable to macromolecules. In addition, the lymphatic drainage system of the tumor functions ineffectively due to immature lymphatic capillaries; thus, nanocarriers are selectively preserved for a long period in the interstitial tissue of the tumor [15]. Numerous studies have shown that the EPR effect induces passive accumulation of macromolecules and micelles in solid tumors, enhancing the therapeutic effect while reducing side effects. It was also found that in most human tumors the effective pore size in the vasculature ranges from 200 to 600 nm in diameter, which allows passive targeting of tumors [16]. It was noted that the secretion of various factors such as nitric oxide, prostaglandins, bradykinin, and the main growth factor of fibroblasts in tumor tissues and overexpression of genes (such as vascular permeability factor or vascular endothelial growth factor) cause hyperpermeability of tumor microvessels. However, let us note that vascular permeability in the tumor changes with its progression and depends on the type of tumor and its anatomical location.",

            "text": "The passive targeting essentially depends on the size of nanoparticles and on the intact fenestration of the endothelia. The enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR) is a phenomenon discovered by Maeda et al. [23] that allows a more specific drug accumulation in solid tumors and in infection sites [24]. \n\nOn the one hand, tumor blood vessels and inflamed tissues have an impaired lymphatic drainage system and leaky vasculature systems with pore sizes that vary from 200 nm to about 800 nm, depending on the cell type or the condition of the tissues. This is mainly due to a defective vascular architecture and widespread and rapid angiogenesis. On the other hand, normal tissues have a vasculature system with pore sizes that do not allow the nanoparticles to pass. For this reason, nanodrugs that fulfill the dimensions reported above can passively arrive at the impaired site and release the drug, having a more specific and effective therapeutic action, with a massive reduction of the needed dosage and consequently reduced onset side effects [25]. \n\nGreish et al. utilized styrene-co-maleic acid (SMA) as a micellar nano-carrier, for many anticancer agents. In a study utilizing SMA-doxorubicin, the group demonstrated the preferential accumulation of SMA-doxorubicin 13-fold higher in tumor tissues compared to equivalent doses of free doxorubicin. Similarly, the group utilized the same micellar system to deliver nano micelles containing dasatinib and targeting PDGF, KIT, and ABl [26,27]. \n\nAt the same time, it is possible to say that the EPR effect could have some limitations. Indeed, non-solid tumors such as leukemia cannot benefit from the EPR effect. Moreover, different tumor types could have different pore sizes, and the nanodrug may be able to target only some areas of the tumor, giving an unpredictable and maybe inefficient therapeutic outcome [28].",

            "text": "However, it is only when PRRXTF is silenced that the tumor cells revert to an epithelial phenotype and gain the ability to colonize at a distance. This study suggests that, if EMT inducers are used correctly, the inhibitory effect of them on tumors can be achieved to some extent. 128 At present, nanodrugs have been developed to inhibit tumor cell EMT. For example, Wang et al. developed an etoposide loaded layered double hydroxide nanocomposite, which can significantly reduce the stemness of tumorigenic glioma stem cells (GSC) and reverse its EMT process, allowing it to restore the epithelial cell morphology, thereby overcoming drug resistance and inhibiting GSC metastasis. 129 However, there is no related research on using nanomaterials to make tumor cells stay in the late EMT state to inhibit tumor metastasis. 130 Therefore, based on summarized studies on the induction of tumor cell EMT by nanomaterials to promote tumor metastasis, we propose that it may be possible to further design nanomaterials to fix tumor cells in a late EMT state and inhibit tumor metastasis, turning the promotion effect of nanomaterials on tumor metastasis into an inhibitory effect and further expanding the application scope of nanomaterials in the field of tumor therapy. \n\nIn the field of nanomedicine, the abnormal vascular system formed by the tumor derived enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect in solid tumors shows a leaky characteristic, which is the mainly regarded method for many powerful nano-anticancer drugs to enter the tumor through the vasculature of the tumor site. Although the EPR effect has been used as the \"gold standard\" for the design of most cancertargeted drugs, there are still many controversies and deficiencies. A study by Chan et al. showed that up to 97% of nanoparticles are not passively transported through the leaky endothelium into the tumor site by paracellular transport but are transported by an active process through endothelial cells. This calls into question the true role of the EPR effect in nanodrug delivery. 131",

[3][4][5] Cancer treatment stands to benefit from targeted drug delivery, as tumor cells express many molecules on their surface that distinguish them from normal cells. 6 Although there are expectations of improved efficacy of targeted NPs derived from specific cellular-level interactions, there are conflicting literature reports on tumor accumulation of targeted NPs: previous reports suggest that a tumor-targeting ligand does not increase NP accumulation in tumors, but the targeting antibody may increase tumor cell internalization. 3,7 The results of these studies suggest that the tumor localization of NPs is independent of the ligand and primarily relies on the EPR effect. 8 These reports are in contrast, however, to others, which suggest that the attachment of tumor-targeting antibody on NPs enhances total accumulation in solid tumor. [9][10][11] One difference might be the presence or absence of polyethylene glycol (PEG) in the complex and its impact on the EPR effect. 12 In fact, the increased circulation time Dovepress Dovepress 4100 capolla et al and tumor retention time of the PEGylated complexes could result in the enhanced tumor accumulation of both targeted and untargeted complexes, thereby masking any effect of the ligand in the process. EPR is a highly variable phenomenon, characterized by large inter-and intraindividual differences. In light of this, a significant number of tumor-targeting studies have focused on the evaluation of parameters affecting the EPR effect, 13,14 and additional studies are clearly needed to understand the influence of NPs' modification on tumor localization and uptake. 3,7,[9][10][11] Currently, several nanotechnology-enabled diagnostic and therapeutic agents for cancer are in clinical trials. 15 Indeed, multifunctionality is the key feature of NP-based",

            "text": "Passive targeting consists of the systemic injection of the nanocarriers that will accumulate preferentially at the site of interest due to the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect (Figure 4) [11]. It depends on the size of the nanocarriers, and if they are small enough, usually less than 100 nm, their circulation is extravagated through vascular defects typically present at the tumor sites due to accelerated angiogenesis. They should reach hepatic and spleen macrophages [68,70]. This passive targeting effect is also dependent on the degree of vascularization of the tumor, the porosity of the vessels, and the sizes of the pores on the vessels (which vary with the type and stage of the tumor). Solid tumors frequently have leaky vasculature in relation to normal tissues. There is also abnormal lymphatic drainage around these tumors. All these factors promote increased EPR by passive nanocarriers [72,73]. Thus, passive targeting depends on the anatomophysiological conditions of the target. The high production of blood vessels that occurs in tumoral tissues to promote their rapid growth allows carriers such as nanoparticles to be easily retained and accumulated in the tumor tissues [17]. \n\nThe EPR effect can be influenced by a complex set of tumor microenvironment (TME) factors, including tumor characteristics, stage, vasculature, stroma, macrophages, lymphatics, and interstitial fluid pressure, and is therefore difficult to predict [17,74]. Concerning the EPR effect, there are still often some discrepancies between the experiences in animal models used for in vivo assays and human clinical treatments. There are significant size differences between mice and humans, and consequently, the pharmacokinetic profiles and the pharmacodynamic properties of the drugs in the tumors also differ. In this respect, larger animal models may be better benchmarks for estimating the EPR effects of targeted delivery of anti-cancer drugs in humans. Furthermore, in animal models, namely, xenograft mouse models, the effect of EPR may vary between formed and spontaneously implanted tumors.",

            "text": "Specific accumulation of drugs in tumors could be achieved by in situ antitumor injections in the specific areas where the tumor develops. However, in addition to being a more complicated treatment, it is not always possible due to the difficulty of identifying cancerous masses [32]. To overcome this difficulty, some delivery systems, in particular SLNs, allow the targeting of tumor tissues by taking advantage of the characteristics of the tumor microenvironment, due to the so-called enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR) ( Figure 5) [2]. This effect is mainly based in the fast angiogenesis carried out by solid tumors to maintain enough supplies of oxygen and nutrients [31].  The angiogenesis process in tumor regions promotes the development of irregular blood vessels with discontinuous epithelium. These discontinuities between epithelial cells, with a size of 100 to 800 nm, allow nanoparticles of certain sizes to move through the interstitial space, being that the base of the increased permeability. In addition, tumor tissues are characterized by a dysfunctional lymphatic system, which implies insufficient lymphatic drainage, leading to the accumulation of nanoparticles in the tumor tissue. This is the basis of increased retention [31,49].\n\nBesides, molecule distribution according to the EPR effect is variable and is determined by three interrelated processes: the extravasation of nanoparticles from the blood vessels, the diffusion of nanoparticles through the tumor tissue, and the interaction with intra-or extracellular targets in the microenvironment of the tumor [49].\n\nAlthough the EPR effect is presented as a beneficial mechanism to improve the selective delivery of drugs, in recent years it has been shown that the clinical results have not reached the expected potential. This effect presents a high heterogeneity and depends on many factors, such as the type and size of the tumor. Tumors where the greatest accumulation of nanomedicines has been found in relation to the EPR effect are the pancreatic, colon, breast, and stomach tumors [50]. Therefore, when exploiting this phenomenon for a specific delivery with SLNs, it could be necessary to take into account the specific characteristics of the tumor.",

            "text": "Nanomaterials possess an exceptional advantage of the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, which is related to anatomical and pathophysiological differences between the tumor tissue and normal tissue. Crucially, the solid tumors are highly vascularized and have large gaps between the endothelial cells in tumor vessels; as a result, macromolecular drugs are selectively extravasated and retained by the tumor tissues (Fang et al., 2011). Nevertheless, the EPR effect can be influenced by the systolic blood pressure and is negligible in advanced cancers (Maeda 2015;Golombek et al., 2018;Shan et al., 2020). In addition to the EPR effect, several strategies were taken into advantage by the researchers, such as modifying targeting molecules, remodeling the tumor microenvironment (TME), and enabling tumor stimuli-responsive properties (Shi et al., 2017;Youn and Bae, 2018;Park et al., 2019). Thus, nanomaterials can be used as delivery agents for anticancer drugs, but they can also be used to convert energy to kill cancer cells, such as light, ultrasound (US), electricity, and magnetothermal energy (Fei et al., 2020a). As a result, in the last few years, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a large number of anticancer nanomaterials, demonstrating the huge potential of nanomaterials for the precision and personalized cancer therapies in future. \n\nFerroptosis, as a novel RCD, has become a popular area of cancer research, and, thus, numerous nanomaterials that induce ferroptosis have been developed for cancer therapy because of their potential antitumor properties. In this review, we try to summarize and discuss the multifunctional ferroptosis-based nanomaterials on the recent advances and breakthroughs in cancer therapies.",

But the formation mechanism of the EPR effect may be different because the microenvironment of tumor and infection is different.

            "text": "Solid tumors are characterized by a heterogeneous vasculature for size and distribution, constituted by a central avascular/necrotic region and a vascularized peripheral region, with discontinuous endothelium in the micro-vessels. In fact, depending on the anatomic region of a tumor, the pore size of the endothelial junctions varies from 100 to 780 nm with a mean of approximately 400 nm (while normal vasculature is characterized by pores smaller than 10 nm), characterizing the leaky microvasculature of tumors; it is also characterized by a disrupted basement membrane, abnormal branching, and enlarged inter-endothelial gaps, with an associated breakdown of tight junctions between endothelial cells. Moreover, tumor vasculature lacks lymphatic drainage and is rich in fenestrations and poor in pericyte coverage. All these features contribute to the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, firstly described by Maeda and co-workers [95]; the tumor vasculature architecture allows extravasation and selective accumulation of nanodrugs in the tumor interstice via a passive targeting mechanism [25,96,97]. Thanks to their size, small molecules diffuse freely in and out of tumor blood vessels and thus do not accumulate in tumors as much as macromolecules do over time. These large gaps between endothelial cells facilitate the extravasation of particulate material from the surrounding vessels into a tumor (Figure 6), but EPR-dependent drug delivery is always compromised by regional blood flow rates, molecular size, polarity, and complexation to serum proteins, which are all factors that reduce the capability of bypassing the membranes of the endothelium. \n\nHowever, some stimulators result in enhanced vascular permeability and extravasation of macromolecules and thus increase the EPR effect. EPR augmenting factors include vasoconstrictors to raise systemic blood pressure, free radicals that affect the integrity of vascular endothelium, and vascular permeability promoters [98]. Therefore, it is clear that the EPR effect is a very heterogeneous phenomenon, varying dramatically from tumor to tumor and from patient to patient.",

            "text": "The passive targeting strategy rest on preferential drug accumulation in tumor cells achieving trough enhanced vascular permeability and retention effect (EPR). The concept of this phenomena and its impact on transport of nano-drugs into cancer tissues was formulated for the first time in 1986 [35]. This theory is based on the fact, that tumor vasculature is characterized by discontinuous epithelium, impaired lymphatic drainage and reduced uptake of the interstitial fluid in contrast to normal blood vessels with firmly sealed endothelium. Subsequent accumulation of macromolecules provides the environment supporting the passive transport of nanotherapeutics to the target site [36]. High heterogeneity of EPR effect cause a significant limitation of this strategy, not only among different patients, but also in the case of the same subject, which whom a varied distribution of pore sizes and consequently, diverse drug delivery might be observed [37]. A precise impact of EPR effect on nanoparticles accumulation in tumor tissues is also difficult to determine, since a variety of nanoparticle properties, including shape, size, zeta potential, presence of homing ligands is involved in this process [38]. Previously, some drug delivery systems using this strategy were introduced to clinical trials. Such agent was SP1049Cpluronic polymeric micelle-based nanoparticles caring doxorubicin tested for advanced adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction treatment and murine leukemia. It was reported that SP1049C decline tumorigenicity and aggressiveness of cancer in vivo and diminishes BCRP (breast cancer resistant protein) overexpression. It also modifies DNA methylation profiles, which results in sensitization of MDR cancer cells to antineoplastic treatment [39,40]. In 2005 and 2008, SP1049C has received an orphan drug designation from FDA for the treatment of esophageal carcinoma and gastrointestinal cancer, respectively. Other nanoformulation, tested in clinical trials, was NK911-micelle encapsulated doxorubicin proposed for the treatment of various solid tumors.",

Therefore molecules or particles of certain sizes tend to gather in tumor tissues more than in normal tissue, 63 as shown in Fig. 2A. This phenomenon is called the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, which is considered to be the mechanism of completing passive targeted therapy of tumor tissues. 64 In preclinical trials, drugs or gene delivery-targeted systems based on EPR have shown signi\ue103cant progress in anticancer efficacy compared with traditional chemotherapy. 65 A variety of nanomaterials based on the EPR effect have been applied in the past few years, where the sizes of the nanobubbles at the nanoscale can be transformed on account of the sizes of the pores in tumor vessels. Given that different gap sizes exist in endothelial cells for different categories of tumors, a suitable size nanomaterial must be established based on the category of the tumor. Also, the obstruction generated by biological barriers when nanoparticles reach the blood circulation system requires high attention. 66 Thus, considering these challenges, to better take advantage of the EPR effect in nanomaterial delivery, various means of treatment have been designed. EPR-based nanoparticle-targeting strategies are primarily committed to adjusting the size of drugs or vectors and/or utilizing ligands that link molecules involving the EPR effect. 67",

            "text": "Solid tumors are the major cause of death worldwide and their treatment remains a challenge [1][2][3]. Chemotherapy is one of the few treatment options available for metastasized tumors which cannot be removed surgically; however, the effectiveness of this therapeutic modality is not yet satisfactory [4]. This problem mainly stems from the lack of tumor selectivity by these agents; hence, the occurrence of severe adverse effects limits the usage of chemotherapy [5]. Nanomedicines have been designed to guide drugs more precisely to tumor cells and away from sites of toxicity. These agents have numerous theoretical advantages over low-molecular-weight drugs, including high drug loading, specific targeting, and the ability to protect the payload from degradation and release the drug in a controlled or sustained manner [6]. Theoretically, nanomedicines with larger particle size leak more slowly from blood vessels compared with most chemotherapy drugs. Fortunately, vascular leakage is a major feature of the vasculature of solid tumors. Specifically, tumor neovasculature has larger lumens and wider fenestrations (200 nm to 1.2 \u00b5m in diameter) due to its lack of a smooth muscle layer and pericytes [7]. When injected intravenously, nanomedicines ranging in size from 10 to 500 nm tend to circulate for a long time and can preferentially access the tumor tissue through the leaky tumor vasculature; subsequently, they are retained in the tumor bed due to reduced lymphatic drainage [8][9][10][11][12]. This pathophysiological phenomenon based on abnormal tumor angiogenesis to increase the delivery of nanomedicines in tumors is known as \"the enhanced permeability and retention\" (EPR) effect [10][11][12][13]. Matsumura and Maeda first reported the EPR effect in 1986 [11]. Follow-up studies rigorously verified that the EPR effect can be observed using macromolecules with an apparent molecular size >45 kDa (the threshold for renal clearance) and a longer plasma half-life.",

The phenomenon of EPR stems from the structural characteristics of the vascular system in solid tumors. Nanoparticles increase the ability to exude through less tight endothelial connections. Once in the tumor microenvironment, the retention of nanoparticles increases due to inadequate lymphatic drainage.

In vivo, MPS is a part of the immune system, which is built by immune and architectural cells and is located in organs such as the liver and spleen. The MPS can remove foreign materials from the bloodstream. Some substances can pass through the MPS and reach to the tumor site, but because of the MPS, the substances' velocity reduces 1000-fold as they enter and traverse the liver. 45 hen HPTTG enters and traverses to the liver, it is retained by the liver because of MPS. Given time, HPTTG can pass through the MPS and circulate in the body. When HPTTG reaches the tumor site, it converts to hydrogel because of the acidic microenvironment and remains at the tumor site; this may be due to the strong hydrophilicity of HPTTG, and it may help it to pass through the MPS. \n\nMoreover, an increment in the vascular permeability and tumor accumulation is termed as the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, which is a main mechanism for passive tumor targeting. 46 The EPR effect is a unique phenomenon of solid tumors. While a large number of substances exploit the EPR effect for tumor uptake, the EPR effect is a molecularweight-dependent phenomenon. 47,48 For the EPR effect, the size of the macromolecule is a crucial factor with respect to uptake by the tumor; this is observed for macromolecules with molecular weights greater than 20 kDa. 49 The accumulation of HPTTG at the tumor site may be caused by the EPR effect instead of being pH-responsive. To investigate whether the accumulation of the HPTTG was indeed due to the tumor acidic microenvironment response rather than the EPR effect, subcutaneous tumor models of mice were used.

[26] These particles can be modified with various types of materials including biomolecules. Altering the organizations of atoms can modify the properties of nanoparticles, such as elasticity, plasticity, strength, and conductivity. \n\nNanoparticle systems have unique properties that allow for both passive and active targeting of tumors. [27] umor neovasculature has abnormal architecture and vessels are highly permeable. The tumor mass has also poor lymphatic drainage, allowing for accumulation of macromolecules greater than approximately 40 kDa within its microenvironment. Nanoparticles utilize this feature, known as the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, to target solid tumors. The ideal size range to benefit from the EPR effect is between 10 and 200 nm. Outside this range, smaller particles will be cleared by the kidney, preventing accumulation within the tumor site, while larger particles will not adequately penetrate the tumor vasculature and interstitial space. However, some clinical trials have not shown the efficacy of the EPR effect. [28] One possible cause of EPR effect failure could be increased interstitial pressure in the tumor microenvironment. It has also been assumed that the EPR effect cannot be employed after an operation. Attempts have been made to increase the efficiency of the EPR effect by induction of hypertension, by repairing the abnormal vasculature, or by targeting of perivascular cells. [28]",

Among others, the most prominent pathophysiological factors contributing to EPR-targeted passive tumor targeting include active transcytosis across the blood vessel wall for NPs extravasation and phagocytic uptake by TAMs as a mechanism of NPs retention [2]. \n\nIn EPR-based passive targeting, TME plays a vital role. One of the crucial metabolic features of fast-proliferating tumor cells is glycolysis, which is the key energy source of cell division and transforms the neighboring milieu into an acidic. This decreased pH of TME can be utilized to deliver pH-responsive NPs to release drugs at a low pH [1,5,6]. \n\nThe EPR effect is dynamic and a phenomenon of tumor blood vessels, which is mostly dependent on blood flow. Animal models of solid tumors rich in blood flow demonstrated enhanced EPR effects. However, many clinical cancers such as late-stage tumors and refractory tumors are associated with poor blood flow due to the coagulation and thrombi formation exhibiting poor EPR effect [7][8][9][10][11][12]. For such tumors, the improvement of EPR-based drug delivery is necessary by modifying tumor blood vessels, angiogenesis, a vascular edifice, blood flow, etc. The EPR effect can be enhanced by modifying vascular intermediaries such as angiotensin II, nitroglycerin or NO, CO, and enzyme inhibitors [7][8][9][10]. An integration of vascular mediators with a nanodrug may be an important strategy for an enhanced EPR effect. Further, targeting tumor stroma and extracellular matrix, and controlling tumor vessels, may improve EPR-targeted drug delivery to tumors [4]. \n\nTumor blood flow and vascular permeability fluctuate significantly, and blood flow is commonly blocked as the tumor size rises.",

            "text": "Cancer has emerged as one of the main causes of death in the world and poses a serious threat to human health. Although conventional therapies, including surgery and radiation, remain as the standard treatment for cancer, the limitations of these treatment options are becoming increasingly apparent [1]. Surgery is an effective treatment method for tumors, but postoperative metastasis and recurrence renders tumor treatment more difficult. The therapeutic effect of radiotherapy is limited by the hypoxic and necrotic region of the tumor. On the other hand, many promising therapeutic methods such as drug therapy, photothermal therapy, photodynamic therapy and immunotherapy are developing rapidly. All of these treatments rely on therapeutic agent such as chemotherapeutic agents, photosensitizers, and immunoadjuvants to reach the tumor region and kill tumor cells through cytotoxicity or immune activation. However, the acidic, hypoxic and hypo-vascular tumor microenvironment affects the delivery of various therapeutic agents, resulting in treatment resistance of tumor cells. Systemic injection of therapeutic agents cannot specifically act on tumor cells and may cause toxic effects on normal tissues. Therefore, many studies focus to improve the targeted delivery of therapeutic agents in order to enhance the tumor therapeutic effect and reduce toxic effects. \n\nIn the past decade, the rapid development of nanomaterials has become a powerful thrust for the advancement of tumor treatment. Nanomaterials such as liposomes, metal particles, polymers and micelles are widely used as targeted delivery carriers of therapeutic agents and play important roles in the treatment of tumors. Tumors are more permeable to nanoparticles (NPs) than normal tissue due to the sifted vascular structure [2]. NPs can enter and remain in tumor tissue through leaky tumor blood vessels to exert therapeutic roles. This phenomenon is called the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, which is the basic mechanism by which NPs deliver drugs to solid tumors [3]. Various nanomaterial-based treatments, including chemotherapy, photothermal therapy (PTT), photodynamic therapy (PDT) and immunotherapy, have been proven to have good tumoral inhibitory effects in preclinical studies.",

            "text": "One of nanomedicine's primary contributions to cancer research is its illustration of the power of intentional agent design as a tool for enhancing drug delivery. This philosophy has spurred decades of research into nanoparticle formulations and functionalization of existing drugs, pushing forward the concept of personalizing medical treatment by tailoring drug design for specific applications. The coming years hold the potential to revolutionize treatment options for a variety of ailments, chief among them being solid tumor cancers.\n\nIn the wake of the massive intellectual and financial investment in nanomedicine design, scrutiny of the founding principles and assumptions upon which the discipline has been built is warranted. Few would argue that that the most prevalent nanomedicine designs principle in cancer treatment is the idea of the Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) effect. First introduced by Matsumura and Maeda in the 1980's [1], the EPR effect describes the phenomenon of high molecular weight drug and nanomedicine accumulation preferentially inside solid tumor models versus healthy tissue counterparts. This was primarily attributed to two tumor characteristics: a) a leaky tumor vasculature as a result of the accelerated angiogenesis that is a hallmark of cancer and b) impaired lymphatic drainage, another result of the disorganized growth of tumors. These original studies showed dramatic uptake in tumor tissue, displaying elevated drug Ivyspring International Publisher concentrations that increased up to 72 hours after injection with minimal accumulation in healthy tissue. The theory did face some criticism, most prominently via work by Jain et al. in their discovery that elevated interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) and heterogeneous blood supply limited macromolecular delivery to tumors [2,3]. Nevertheless, its basis and implications remain largely unchanged more than three decades later.\n\nThe observation of the EPR effect provided a clear design philosophy for cancer therapy development -increase drug concentration at the site of interest relative to healthy tissue as a means of alleviating treatment side effects. This was explored mainly through optimizing formulations for increased blood circulation time, such as encapsulation of agents within liposomes and surface chemistry modification using PEG chains. These changes led to longer exposure of the tumor site to circulating nanoparticles, increasing relative accumulation. Time-dependent optimization was coupled with careful size selection",

These approaches intend to increase the EPR effect  inherent to solid tumors; for instance, application of a single 15 Gy-radiation dose in a syngeneic mouse breast tumor model doubled the accumulation of iron oxide nanoparticles in tumor tissue [40]. This effect is associated with decreased interstitial pressure and the subsequent increase in vascular permeability and thus provides a new tool to improve drug delivery into the tumor. \n\nVarious strategies have been studied to endow nanosystems with stealth (Figure 2). For instance, when the proportion of hydrophilic and hydrophobic polymers is changed with negligible variation in particle size, the charges and core composition of spontaneously self-assembled micelles hindered their elimination by RES [41]. When tracked in vivo, some of these micelles accumulated less in liver, while they were more concentrated in blood at 1 h after intravenous injection, as compared with PEGylated micelles.",

Such nanocarriers mainly include liposome, polymeric micelle, nanoconjugate, gold nanoparticle, carbon nanotube, dendrimer, and phagebased nanoplatforms [10]. Among these nanoplatforms, polymeric nanoparticles, a kind of colloidal particle that consists of natural or synthetic polymers, have received the majority of attention due to their excellent stability and the ease of surface modification [11]. Besides, the particles, which are approximately 100 nm in size, are characterized by low clearance during circulation and a high enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect in solid tumor [12]. EPR effects, a phenomenon resulting from the defective architecture of tumor blood vessels and various vascular permeability factors, have a pivotal effect on the distribution and intratumoral penetration of nanoparticles [13]. It has been demonstrated that the microvascular pore size of a glioma is 7 to 100 nm; thus, the particles that are approximately 100 nm in diameter tend to be appropriate vehicles for penetration into the tumor interior through the large gaps between endothelial cells [14,15]. \n\nAlthough EPR effect of tumor could facilitate the accumulation of chemotherapeutics-loaded nanoparticles into tumor parenchyma, using passive targeting seems inadequate, as splenic filtration and phagocytes in the liver may decrease the accumulation of nanoparticles in tumors [12]. Besides, the EPR effect of brain tumor was much weaker than that of peripheral tumors, indicating that BBB is still a main obstacle for brain tumor drug delivery [16,17]. In this case, drug delivery system which could simultaneously targeted the BBB and brain tumor might facilitate drug penetrated from vascular and selectively accumulated in tumor cells [16,17]. Advances in the analysis of tumor cell proteins have expanded the use of dual-targeted drug delivery. Among these, various receptors expressed on the surface of or inside tumor cells allow for active targeting delivery of agents into tumor tissues [18].",

However, the delivery of nano-sized agents into cancer tissue is problematic because it mostly relies on the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect that depends on the leaky nature of the tumor vasculature and the prolonged circulation of nano-sized agents, allowing slow but uneven accumulation in the tumor bed. Delivery of nano-sized agents is dependent on several factors that influence the EPR effect; 1. Regional blood flow to the tumor, 2. Permeability of the tumor vasculature, 3. Structural barriers imposed by perivascular tumor cells and extracellular matrix, 4. Intratumoral pressure. In this review, these factors will be described and methods to enhance nano-agent delivery will be reviewed.",

            "text": "Of importance in this regard is that the tumor accumulation behavior of nanoparticles is significantly affected by the pathophysiology of tumor tissues [10]. In 11 canine cancer patients with spontaneous solid tumors, 110nm-sized nanoparticle displayed high uptake levels in six of seven carcinomas, whereas the same nanoparticle accumulated only one of four sarcomas [11]. Highly permeable tumor models, such as the colon adenocarcinoma LS174T model, are reported to allow significant accumulation of nanoparticles that are even 400nm in diameter [12]. On the other hand, subcutaneous pancreatic BxPC3 tumors are reported to have thick fibrotic stroma and hypo vascularity, hampering the tumor accumulation of N50nm-sized nanoparticles, but not 30 nm-sized ones. Eventually, only 30nmsized nanoparticles accomplished significant antitumor activity in the pancreatic tumor model [13]. These facts have encouraged researchers to engineer smaller delivery vehicles with a size of less than 50nm for enhanced accumulation in heterogeneous tumor tissues. Meanwhile, the EPR effect in human patients has been observed in a handful of examples and is noteworthy [14,15]. A polymer-drug conjugate with a molecular weight of approximately 15kDa, termed SMANCS, which is able to bind to blood albumin and thereby shows significantly increased blood circulation, was found to accumulate in clinical hepatocellular and renal cell carcinomas with a high vascular density through arterial infusion [16]. With a diameter of approximately 90 nm, PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin or Doxil\u00ae has a circulation half-life of 21-90h [17][18][19][20], exhibiting a 10-fold greater selective accumulation in metastatic breast carcinoma tissue compared to tumor-free skeletal muscle in two patients [21]. The EPR effect observed in animal models needs to be carefully interpreted for the translation to clinical settings as described in other reviews [22][23][24].",

However, the efficiency of EPR-targeted nanodrugs is not always pleasing as it is strongly prejudiced by the heterogeneity of the enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR). Targeting the dynamics of the EPR effect and improvement of the therapeutic effects of nanotherapeutics by using EPR enhancers is a vital approach to developing cancer therapy. Inadequate data on the efficacy of EPR in humans hampers the clinical translation of cancer drugs. Molecular targeting, physical amendment, or physiological renovation of the tumor microenvironment (TME) are crucial approaches for improving the EPR effect. Advanced imaging technologies for the visualization of EPR-induced nanomedicine distribution in tumors, and the use of better animal models, are necessary to enhance the EPR effect. This review discusses strategies to enhance EPR effect-based drug delivery approaches for cancer therapy and imaging technologies for the diagnosis of EPR effects. The effort of studying the EPR effect is beneficial, as some of the advanced nanomedicine-based EPR-enhancing approaches are currently undergoing clinical trials, which may be helpful to improve EPR-induced drug delivery and translation to clinics.",

This prolongs median survival from 6.7 months (for gemcitabine alone) to 8.5 months. 2 The basic assumption behind nab-paclitaxel is the EPR effect, first proposed in 1986. 3 The EPR hypothesis suggests that tumor neovasculature is immature with underdeveloped lymphatic drainage. This leads to increased leakage of macromolecules from blood vessels (enhanced permeability) and accumulation of leaked macromolecules (enhanced retention). \n\nThe EPR effect is the theoretical basis of cancer nanomedicine 4 and its application to diagnosis and/or treatment. However, nanomedicine has yet to reach its full potential. It is becoming increasingly clear that a major hurdle is the existence of a heterogeneous TME 5,6 in which there exists complex tumor-stromal crosstalk. 7,8 We therefore aim to provide Abbreviations: ABC, accelerated blood clearance; CAST, cancer stroma targeting therapy; EPR, enhanced permeability and retention; GEMM, genetically engineered murine model; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; PDX, patient-derived xenograft; PSC, pancreatic stellate cell; TGF-b, transforming growth factor-b; TME, tumor microenvironment.",

The fenestrations in the vascular system allow the drug carriers accumulation in TME where enable prolonged, selective drug release [11,14]. However, the passive targeted accumulation of nanoparticles at TME is often insufficient to exert a drug effect [15]. For this reason, the translation of nanoparticle research into the clinic has been relatively slow and rather disappointing [16]. Studies over the last decade that used the nanoparticles showed that only approximately 0.7% of the administered nanomedicine dose reached the tumor [17]. The active targeting strategies are being proposed to challenge the limitations of passively-targeted nanoparticles [12].

            "text": "Imaging tracers smaller than 60 kDa are preferably excreted via the renal system and are not metabolized or retained by the liver. However, compared to full-size antibodies, smaller molecules may have poorer affinities and lower overall tumor uptake 24 . \n\nAutoradiography of the negative and positive tumors revealed an accumulation of tracers in the narrow periphery of blood vessels and at the edge around the tumor, a phenomenon that also deserves further investigation in follow-up studies. While mAbs have the ability to bind specifically to tumor cells, their initial diffusion from the vasculature into tumor tissue is similar to that of non-targeting molecules and relies on the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, a unique property of tumors that affects diffusion of macromolecules through leaky blood vessels in the tumor area 25,26 . Due to the rapid growth of tumors, the surrounding blood vessels can have a defective architecture, which is exacerbated by the production of various permeability factors. Molecules larger than 40 kDa benefit from the EPR effect, promoting the accumulation in the tumor. However, the efficacy varies and is influenced by multiple factors including vascular permeability, endothelial receptors, vascular maturation, extracellular matrix, hypoxia, interstitial fluid pressure, and tumor cell density 26 . Strategies that promote EPR and release mAbs accumulated at the periphery of blood vessels could improve the access and availability of the mAb to the target. In agreement with this, we hypothesize that the uptake observed in the p53 negative tumors is due to the EPR effect may be reduced by using molecules smaller than 40 kDa. Here, for example, the use of Fab fragments could potentially achieve even better contrast between positive and negative tumors and could instead be better suited for diagnostic imaging. \n\nWhile our study highlights the R175H mutation linked to LFS, we recognize that antibodies may not be suitable for treating LFS patients due to the presence of mutant p53 in healthy tissues. Our preliminary optical imaging results in R172H mutant mice using the CF750-conjugated 4H5 mAb showed greater uptake in spontaneous tumors, but also some uptake was also observed in normal organs (carrying the R172H mutation).",

The imbalance of angiogenic regulators create an abnormal vascular network of tumor tissue that is highly disorganized and characterized by dilated, leaky blood vessels and exhibiting poor lymphatic drainage [30].

For example, PEGylated liposomes were leaked and retained specifically into tumor tissues rather than normal ones. Consequently, reduced drug toxicity is expected when using PEGylated liposomes containing anticancer drugs. This process is known as enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR) and is extensively exploited to achieve passive targeting of chemotherapeutic agents [30,41,42]. EPR was described for the first time by Maeda and co-workers [43]. Also, it is demonstrated that EPR effect is the major mechanism for the selective accumulation of nanotherapeutics in tumors [44]. Nanocarrier therapies such as PEGylated liposomes have been extensively utilized as drug delivery system to achieve tumor tissues targeting via EPR effect. Surface modification with PEG was found to dramatically decrease the uptake of liposomes by MPS, extend liposomes half-life and increase tumor accumulation of PEGylated liposomes. It was clear that PEGylated liposomes do not distribute uniformly in solid tumors after passive accumulation because of the broad heterogeneity of EPR effects within tumor tissues [30]. \n\nOn the other hand , tumor properties like tumor size, type of cancer and extent of tumor vasculature have a great effect on the extent of extravasation and tumor accumulation of PEGylated liposomes [45]. An ideal example is Doxil \u00ae , PEGylated doxorubicin liposomes, which has shown stealth properties and was demonstrated to increase the serum half-life of their loaded active. It was found that doxorubicin was released only in the tumor ' s interstitial fluid because of the considerable raised level of ammonia concentration which produced in tumor tissues due to the glutaminolysis (special metabolic pathway of tumor cells).",

            "text": "The tumor vasculature provides gas exchange and molecular transport to influence the tumor microenvironment. Excessive angiogenesis causes distorted and leaky tumor vessels that reduce the efficiency of blood perfusion. Due to the porous vessel wall, intravascular plasma, molecular, and nano-sized particles passively penetrate into tumor tissue and are retained due to the dysfunctional lymphatic system, called the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect [32]. Although the EPR effect can increase the nanodrug accumulation within tumors, the elevated interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) restricts the penetration distance of nanodrugs, resulting in non-uniform drug distribution [33]. Tumor VN can remodel abnormal tumor vessels into normal and mature phenotypes under anti-angiogenic status [6]. The normalized tumor vasculature has a mature morphology to enhance blood perfusion through repair of vessel function, reduction of IFP by vessel pore shrinking, and prevention of hypoxia by promoting oxygenation, which improves the malignant tumor microenvironment and treatment outcome [34]. Chauhan et al. proved that the intratumoral penetration was enhanced for the 12 nm nanoparticles after VN, but showed no improvement for the 60 and 125 nm nanoparticles [35]. Although tumor VN might decrease the EPR effect by shrinking the vascular pore size, the decreased IFP could enhance the penetration of small-nanosized or molecular drugs to improve therapeutic efficacy [7,28]. The balance between tumor VN and the EPR effect was mainly associated with the size of drugs in drug penetration. Thus, we used small molecular drug DOX to exclude the interference of drug sizes and demonstrated the enhancement of drug penetration after tumor VN in the present study. Besides, the efficiency of tumor VN induced by O 2 -MBs treatment was associated with the initial tumor size. The initial tumor diameter of 8 mm reduced perfusion intensity over time after O 2 -MBs treatment, but tumor necrosis occurred according to the histological images staining by H&E (data was not shown).",

            "text": "For example, the EPR effect varies between different solid tumors and even different regions within the same tumor.The EPR effect performs poorly in PC due to the dense extracellular matrix (ECM) and abnormal vascular structures within the tumor microenvironment (TME).This variability in the EPR effect is further exemplified by significant differences between a patient's primary and metastatic tumors [24].Typically, the EPR effect is predominantly observed in larger and mature tumors, while it is less effective in newly formed, smaller tumors [25].Moreover, events such as thrombosis, which decrease blood perfusion, can further modify the EPR effect [26].In addition to this heterogeneity, design deficiencies in nanoparticles can lead to ineffective EPR outcomes.According to Dr. Maeda, unlike passive targeting, the EPR effect's tumor targeting is distinct, as evidenced by differing accumulation times within tumor tissues [27].The half-life of nanoparticles also plays a crucial role.A short half-life means that after conversion to free low molecular weight drugs, they are unable to target and accumulate in tumors for prolonged periods using the EPR effect.Conversely, a long half-life can result in slow drug release, which may consequently lead to poor therapeutic outcomes.Moreover, factors such as the size, shape, surface charge, and surface modifications of nanoparticles significantly influence the efficacy of the EPR effect.\n\nIn light of these findings, many studies have devised strategies to augment the EPR effect.These strategies encompass nanoparticle modification and both physical and pharmacological treatments to modify the TME [24,28].Appropriate design regarding size, shape, half-life, charge, surface characteristics, and biocompatibility of nanoparticles can enhance their EPR effect [29].Generally, nanoparticles ranging from a few to approximately 100 nanometers in size are seen as more effective at utilizing the EPR effect to target tumors, with effectiveness varying by the tumor type and nanoparticle variety [28].This size range is crucial for optimizing the EPR effect in targeting tumors, although the ideal size may differ based on the type of tumor and nanoparticle [28].",

            "text": "This observed toxic effects of AgNPs are in agreement with that of many previous reports (Hajipour et al. 2020;Elsharawy et al. 2020). \n\nIn the present study, the efficacy of the prepared nanocomposite was assessed in vivo by following up the change in the intraperitoneal Ehrlich ascites (fluid) tumor volume and cellular viability after intraperitoneal treatment with the nanocomposite, and a marked inhibition in Ehrlich tumor growth was demonstrated. This marked decrease in Ehrlich tumor volume upon treatment can be explained by the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. The EPR effect is based on the hyperpermeability of the tumor vessels due to the large holes between endothelial cells of the tumor vessel wall, and the absence of lymphatics, allowing therapeutic particles to enter the tumor and stay there (Jain and Stylianopoulos 2010). In our case, both tumor and the therapeutic nanocomposite were present together in the peritoneal cavity and retained there for the entire treatment period. These are ideal conditions for the EPR effect. However, this fluid Ehrlich tumor model cannot answer the question about the delivery of our rGO flakes that exceed 300 nm to solid tumors, where the effect of the nanoparticle size must be considered for optimal drug delivery and therapeutic outcome. Nevertheless, it is known that the holes in the solid tumor vessel wall range from 200 nm to 2 \u03bcm with an average of about 400 nm (Gao et al. 2012), compared to holes of the normal vessel wall with size of less than 10 nm. In this context, our prepared nanocomposite would be advantageous since it could selectively pass through the holes of the solid tumor vessels but will not be able to extravasate to normal tissues, reducing the adverse toxic effects. Also, the negative charge of this nanocomposite may prevent from being recognized and prolonged their circulation time in blood, which in turn enhanced the EPR effect (Pei et al. 2020). Therefore, in this study, the size and charge of rGO/AgNC were suitable for the EPR effect in the studied model and can be advantageous for application in treatment of solid tumors.",

            "text": "Most solid tumors have blood vessels with a defective architecture, such as large gaps between endothelial cells and lack of smooth muscle layers, so that macromolecules such as liposomes will have the opportunity to escape from tumor blood vessels and accumulate selectively in tumor tissues (enhanced permeability and retention [EPR] effect). Therefore, utilization of the EPR effect is an effective strategy for delivery of liposomes to the site of a tumor. However, tumor microenvironments including vascularity, permeability, or blood flow are different among different types of tumors [10]. First, we investigated the morphological differences among subcutaneously implanted Colon 26, LLC, M109, Neuro2a, and S180 tumors. Major morphological differences were found between the different tumor models at macroscopic levels. M109 and Neuro2a tumors showed an intense red color and blood-filled areas, indicating well developed vascularization (Figure 1(a)). In contrast, the macroscopic view of dissected LLC, Colon 26, and S180 tumors showed a white or pale color, indicating poor vascularization. \n\nNext, we characterized the vascular structure of tumors by immunohistochemical analysis. Examination of Neuro 2a and S180 tumor sections showed that large open vessels were well covered with \u03b1-SMA-positive pericytes, but narrow vessels were not (Figure 1(b)), indicating that the vasculature of Neuro 2a and S180 tumors might be relatively stable and non-leaky. In contrast, most of the CD31-positive endothelial cells were not covered with \u03b1-SMA-positive pericytes in Colon 26, LLC and M109 tumors, suggested that the vasculature of these tumors might be leaky.",

[96,97]The permeability and retention (EPR) effect is the most widely utilized principle for capturing and accumulating therapeutic nanoparticles at tumor sites. [98,99]his effect is enhanced by the presence of incomplete and underdeveloped vasculatures in and around metastatic sites.The passive targeting of nanoparticles could be improved via modification with tumor-sensitive ligands. [100,101]Specific responsive agents can be conjugated to nanoparticles to act as a switch that is activated by unique stimuli such as hypoxia, [102,103] pH, [104][105][106] enzymes, [107,108] temperature, [109] magnetic fields, [110] ultrasound, [111] and their combinations, thus improving the accuracy and efficacy of nanomedicine for targeting treatment of tumors.114] Although the nanomedicine approach for treating cancer metastasis has attracted great attention in recent decades, obstacles such as a weaker EPR effect, the BBB, and the BTB, especially at the early stage of brain metastases, remain to be overcome. [3,5,115]It is challenging to treat metastatic tumors by nanomedicine through either passive or active targeting.However, novel nanomedicinal approaches for treating antimetastatic tumors have been recently developed, and their treatment efficacies and effects are quite promising and encouraging.Nanotechniques and nanoparticles for capture of circulating tumor cells and chemotherapy have been well detailed in a recent review article, and some of the results may be useful in the clinical setting.

            "text": "Although the use of nanoparticles has shown several advantages [15], their site-specific delivery is still a problem for which passive and active-targeting approaches are necessary [16,17]. \n\nThe passive targeting approach utilizes the exploitation of the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. In many disease conditions, including lung cancers, the endothelial lining of the blood vessels exhibits higher permeability than in normal conditions [17,18]. The presence of this leaky vasculature allows the higher permeation of the nanoparticles into the target site [19]. Moreover, the lack of a normal lymphatic drainage system in the tumor site contributes to higher levels of retention of the nanoparticles. However, this idiosyncratic property cannot be applied to low molecular weight drugs which have a small residence time and rapid excretion from the tumorous cells. Low molecular weight drugs can be encapsulated in unionized drug carriers to improve their pharmacokinetics (elongated systematic circulation), increasing tumor selectivity and lowering side effects. This phenomenon of tumor-targeting is called \"passive\" and depends upon the properties of the carrier molecule (its molecular weight and residence time) and the tumor anatomy (vascularity, porosity, etc.), but does not have any ligands for specific cells' binding sites. The EPR effect provides a 20-30% higher concentration of the drug targeted delivery of the tumorous site compared to normal body tissues [20,21]. \n\nEPR effect is extremely dependent on the intrinsic pathways of tumor cells' growth and it is controlled specifically by the rate of angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, the rate of perivascular tumor development, stromal thickness response and the intratumor pressure. All these elements, along with the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles, can influence the efficiency of the drug's targeted delivery [22]. However, the extrusion properties of the newly formed tumor's blood vessels have an impact on the nanomedicine impregnation; it causes an increase in the interstitial pressure, which may hinder the retention of the drug carriers in the tumor tissues.",

Alternatively, liposomes are taken up by the cell, their phospholipids are incorporated into the cell membrane, and the drug trapped inside is then released [12]. Common liposomes, though, were in the body for only a short duration, and many were phagocytized by the reticuloendothelial system (RES). However, the 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[maleimide(polyethylene glycol)-2000] (DSPE-PEG2000) modification to the surface of a liposome potentially prevents interactions in-vivo, thus extending the circulation lifetime of the liposome [13][14][15]. In tumor tissue, because tumor cells grow so quickly, newly formed tumor vessels are comprised of poorly-aligned and defective endothelial cells with wide fenestrations that lack a smooth muscle layer and innervation with the wider lumen. Furthermore, tumor tissues usually lack effective lymphatic drainage [16]. Tumor microvessel permeability is 400~600 nm with permeability for macromolecules having a molecular weight of 2.5 \u00d7 10 4~1 6 \u00d7 10 4 Da [17]. These factors lead to abnormal molecular and fluid transport dynamics. Therefore, enhancement of the extravasation of certain sizes of molecules, such as macromolecular drugs or liposomes, leads to a much greater accumulation in tumour tissue versus normal tissue. Due to the tumor selective enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR), this results in extensive extravasation of the liposomes [16,18]. In solid tumours, the EPR effect is a universal phenomenon in which liposomes are passively targeted to tumour tissue, ultimately leading to enhanced accumulation of the liposomes in the tumor interstitium [19].\n\nRecently, FAD of USA approved a few liposomal products, such as Evacet, AM Bison, and doxorubicin in a long-circulating PEG-coated liposome.

Passive targeting is generally delivered through nanoparticle systems, which contains liposomes, micelles, polydopamine, inorganic nanomaterials, etc (87). The mechanism is mainly to enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect by adjusting the size of nanoparticles and modifying the surface chemistry. In solid tumor tissue, there are abundant blood vessels, wide vascular wall space, poor structural integrity, and lack of lymphatic return, resulting in selective high permeability and retention of macromolecules and nanoparticles (88). Duchi et al. developed 80 nm shell-core fluorescent nanoparticles (FNP), the shell was made of polymethylmethacrylate, and loaded with the PS tetrasulfonated aluminum phthalocyanine (Ptl). Ptl@FNP were concentrated on prostate cancer cells through EPR effect (60). However, the EPR effect is controversial. In 2020, a study was reported by Chan et al. that up to 97% of nanoparticles enter the tumor through active processes of endothelial cells (89). The results may influence the development of nanoparticles of PS in the future. \n\nActive targeting to improve tumor selectivity typically through binding or adhering to specific receptors overexpressed on cancer cell surface, including proteins (e.g. antibodies), peptides (e.g. arginine-glycine-aspartate peptide and epidermal growth factor), aptamers, vitamins (e.g. folic acid and biotin) (90) and carbohydrates (91). Compared to antibody or antibody fragments, peptides and aptamers are rapidly cleared from the body due to their small size.",

            "text": "Passive targeting is mainly based on the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. \n\nIn 1986, Maeda and co-workers named EPR effect to the mechanism in which macromolecules with a high molecular weight, 15000 to 70000 daltons, such as polymers and proteins precipitate and accumulate effectively in tumor tissues [45]. Such high accumulation usually last more than 24 hours [45]. This phenomenon was attributed to the hypervasculature and enhanced vascular permeability in solid tumors, which is due to the overproduction of vascular mediators including bradykinin, nitric oxide (NO), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and carbon monoxide (CO) [46]. Moreover, solid tumors have defective blood vessels with large gaps, up to 1.0 \u03bcm between endothelial cells, whereby macromolecules pass to the tumor [14]. Since solid tumors lack adequate lymphatic drainage, there is therefore a poor circulatory recovery of the extravasated macromolecules, resulting in their accumulation in the tumor microenvironment for long periods [14]. This phenomenon was not observed in healthy blood vessels [45]; hence, it constituted a promising strategy to treat selectively cancer solid tumors using nanocarriers like polymer-coated liposomes [47]. Prolonged blood circulation may allow a longer interaction time between liposomes and the target. The incorporation of soluble, hydrophilic, flexible and biocompatible polymers such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) or its derivatives within the bilayer of conventional liposomes leads to the formation of a protective and hydrophilic layer on their surface. This prevents the recognition of liposomes by opsonins and reduces their clearance by the reticuloendothelial system (RES) and consequently extends the liposomal half-life [48]. Other prominent synthetic polymers with stealth properties are poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) and poly(acryl amide) (PAA) [11]. \n\nLiposomes size is another parameter with high impact on the passive targeting through the EPR effect.",

Once metastatic growths break through the serous membrane, cancer cells can spread into various pelvic organs. Endothelial cells become gradually more essential to vascularize the tissue, when tumor metastases grow larger than approximately 2 mm 3 , at a threshold where cells in newly forming tumor cores will reach a state of hypoxia. Solid tumors are generally associated with compromised vascular integrity and impaired lymphatic drainage; culminating in a phenomenon termed the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect [48]. The EPR effect is a passive mechanism and leads to NP accumulation in solid tumor tissue, as further discussed in Section 3.2 of this review. However, at this stage of cancer progression, peritoneally delivered NPs will reach target cells in the ascites through convection, and advanced metastases through the EPR effect. Hence, it can be speculated that the suggested route will be sufficient without the need for systemic IV administration.",

            "text": "Nanomaterials can reach and accumulate in tumors via passive and active targeting. While active targeting depends on specific interactions between nanomaterials and tumors (see Section 1.3.3), passive tumor targeting by nanomaterials precedes the active targeting and is essential to create an opportunity for the occurrence of specific interactions. Indeed, passive and preferential targeting of the tumors by both NPs and NCs have been observed, and this phenomenon has been named the enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR) [132,134]. EPR can be explained by the presence of pores with sizes of up to 2000 nm within tumors [135]. These pores represent inter-endothelial gaps formed during angiogenesis in the tumors, and they allow NPs to accumulate in cancer tissues at higher concentrations than in normal tissues. Thus, this passive accumulation of NPs in tumors takes advantage of the pathophysiological properties of the tumor tissue. Despite being the foundation of tumor-targeted drug delivery and the NP accumulation principle, the EPR effect in patients has been recently questioned [136,137]; the mechanism of entry of NPs into solid tumors appears to be more intricate than considered earlier [138]. Either way, passive tumor targeting by nanomaterials has certain disadvantages, such as arbitrary targeting, inefficient dispersion of the NPs, and variability among different tumor types and different patients [137]. Interestingly, the EPR effect is generally more pronounced in animal models than in cancer patients, which hampers understanding of the NC biodistribution and translation to clinic of the results obtained in animal studies. \n\nThe biodistribution of NPs and NCs is affected by their interaction with the environment, and this interaction differs for NPs and NCs. Upon administration, NPs are rapidly exposed to protein-rich biological fluids. These proteins interact with the NPs and form a protein corona on their surface [139]. Such protein coronas affect the size and charge of the NPs [140] as well as their stability, dispersibility, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity profiles [141]. Ultimately, the biodistribution of decorated NPs is altered, and they may even get recognized by the immune system (RES).",

            "text": "any research studies that focus on directing chemotherapeutics to solid tumors using nanocarriers rely on a long-standing passive targeting approach called 'enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect' . 7 The endothelial linings of the blood vessels in normal tissues would inhibit the diffusion of nanoparticles (NPs). On the other hand, an actively growing tumor involves rapid neovascularization, resulting in a tissue architecture that distinctively differ from its normal counterpart, which is characterized by 1) faulty endothelial linings with gaps and; 2) lack of lymphatic drainage. 7,8 The EPR effect suggests that macromolecular drug carriers can, in theory, accumulate in a solid tumor tissue passively based on such pathologic characteristics, and may serve as a tentative model for reduced toxicity via such passive targeting of cytotoxic agents. \n\nHowever, this approach has been less effective in practice than in theory due to the fact that some tumors have well-developed lymphatic drainage. 8,9 1][12] Therefore, high levels of therapeutics may fail to retain sufficiently in tumor sites, reducing the reliability of the EPR effect. Specific targeting of tumor cells may help to retain NPs in the tumor site and avoid their rapid removal by the brain lymphatic drainage. The delivery process of carrying the chemotherapeutic agent across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and then homing onto the tumor site, is called \"dual-targeting\". Dual-targeting systems are intended to increase the efficiency of the drug, and also to significantly reduce systemic side effects.

            "text": "Unlike conventional contrast agent, which has rapid wash-in/wash-out tumor kinetics, liposomes gradually extravasate, through the permeable tumor vasculature, and accumulate in tumors, a phenomenon known as enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) [22]. Intratumoral transport of liposomes primarily occurs by a restricted convective process and further hindered by high interstitial fluid pressures [23,24]. The signal enhancement patterns of tumor lesions varied depending on their location and size. In the liver, large primary tumors appeared hypo-enhanced compared to normal liver parenchyma during early-phase imaging. In delayed-phase scans, the lesions were visible due to heterogeneous signal enhancement pattern within the tumor; on the contrary, normal liver was homogenously opacified. Since Liposomal-I is primarily distributed in the blood compartment, the heterogeneous pattern of signal enhancement in the post-15 min scan infers to spatial variability in the tumor perfusion. During delayed-phase imaging, the heterogeneous enhancement pattern is likely a consequence of regional variation in tumor vessel permeability. Furthermore, intra-tumoral signal enhancement appeared more intense in post-24 h images than in post-15 min images, a  characteristic that can be attributed to the extravasation and intra-tumoral retention of liposomal particles. Small malignant lesions (< 1 cm) appeared hypo-enhanced during early-phase imaging, likely due to perfusion differences between tumor tissue and normal parenchyma. These lesions remained hypo-enhanced in the delayed-phase imaging; however, lesion conspicuity was improved due to increased contrast between normal parenchyma and tumor tissue. Although the small lesion size precluded intra-tumoral assessment of signal enhancement, retention of liposomal contrast agent within the metastatic lesion cannot be ruled out [25,26]. Evaluation of lesion visibility could not be studied beyond 24 hours due to protocol constraints; however, the lesions are likely going to be visible for several days due to the slow clearance of Liposomal-I from tumors and RES organs.",

            "text": "Despite recent advances in the translation of therapeutic nanoparticles (TNPs) into the clinic, the field continues to face challenges in predictably and selectively delivering nanomaterials for the treatment of solid cancers. The concept of enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) has been coined as a convenient but simplistic descriptor of high TNP accumulation in some tumors. However, in practice EPR represents a number of physiological variables rather than a single one (including dysfunctional vasculature, compromised lymphatics and recruited host cells, among other aspects of the tumor microenvironment) \u2014 each of which can be highly heterogenous within a given tumor, patient and across patients. Therefore, a clear need exists to dissect the specific biophysical factors underlying the EPR effect, to formulate better TNP designs, and to identify patients with high-EPR tumors who are likely to respond to TNP. The overall pharmacology of TNP is governed by an interconnected set of spatially defined and dynamic processes that benefit from a systems-level quantitative approach, and insights into the physiology have profited from the marriage between in vivo imaging and quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) methodologies. In this article, we review recent developments pertinent to image-guided systems pharmacology of nanomedicines in oncology. We first discuss recent developments of quantitative imaging technologies that enable analysis of nanomaterial pharmacology at multiple spatiotemporal scales, and then examine reports that have adopted these imaging technologies to guide QSP approaches. In particular, we focus on studies that have integrated multi-scale imaging with computational modeling to derive insights about the EPR effect, as well as studies that have used modeling to guide the manipulation of the EPR effect and other aspects of the tumor microenvironment for improving TNP action. We anticipate that the synergistic combination of imaging with systems-level computational methods for effective clinical translation of TNPs will only grow in relevance as technologies increase in resolution, multiplexing capability, and in the ability to examine heterogeneous behaviors at the single-cell level.",

SaNPs are administered IV to the patient and accumulate in tumors through the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. The patient then undergoes regional AMF application (300kHz) that is converted to thermal energy, inducing sub-ablative hyperthermic cancer cell death. Based on extensive pre-clinical testing, treatment was proven safe and biocompatible in animal models without any associated toxicities. Efficacy studies in a murine metastatic cancer model, demonstrated the ability to reduce the number and size of metastatic lesions.\n Methods: A First-in-Human open label dose escalation study was designed to evaluate the feasibility and safety of treatment in patients (n=18) with advanced metastatic solid tumors. A secondary objective was to evaluate initial efficacy signs. Eligibility criteria included patients with a life expectancy of at least 30 days with measurable disease according to RECIST 1.1. The patients underwent toxicity analysis and MRI scans without contrast media before (baseline), after treatment, and at the end of the follow-up period of 1 month. Vital signs were monitored before, during, and after treatment. Measurements included ECG, oral and body surface temperatures, blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation.\n Results: 3 patients were enrolled in the first cohort that received a single SaNP injection of 10% (first dose level) without AMF. No systemic toxicity was observed. 7 patients were then enrolled and SaNP was administered at the same dose followed by AMF irradiation (first dose level of 40%) of the torso area, conducted for two intervals of 5 min. each. SaNP administration procedures were successful in all cases whereas, 3 patients succeeded to complete the full treatment in accordance to the study protocol. During AMF exposure, the patients were covered with a cooling blanket and temperatures were monitored using fiber-optic sensors. There were no significant temperature deviations beside one patient, where a rise in oral temperature was noted due to the presence of dental implants which heated up. In all patients there were no significant differences in any of the vital signs post-injection nor before or after AMF except for one patient, for whom increased heart rate was observed during irradiation, returning to baseline thereafter. No treatment-related abnormal clinical pathology or urinalysis results were identified. Some fluctuations were observed, attributed to the disease stage. Although tumor response was not expected at the first dose levels, MRI and CT results for one patient showed a reduction in a breast tumor and in another patient, stable disease was reported.\n Conclusion: SaNP administration either alone or followed by AMF application was not associated with any significant adverse reactions, and no clinical or humoral toxicity was observed at initial doses of 10% SaNP and 40% AMF.\n Citation Format: Sarah Kraus, Cheri Tal, Boaz Shalev, Moshe Eltanani, Pazit Rukenstein, Shir Arbib, Michal Eck, Raz Khandadash, Shaul Atar, Arnoldo Cyjon, Ofer Shalev.

Also, we visualize the heterogeneity of tumor tissues, achieving oxygen saturation distribution images.

The field has been devoted to treatment of cancer by exploiting EPR-based accumulation of nanocarriers in solid tumors, which for many years was considered to be a ubiquitous phenomenon. However, the understanding of differences in the EPR-effect between tumor types, heterogeneities within each patient group, and dependency on tumor development stage in humans is sparse. It is therefore important to enhance our understanding of the EPR-effect in large animals and humans with spontaneously developed cancer. In the present paper, we describe a novel loading method of copper-64 into PEGylated liposomes and use these liposomes to evaluate the EPR-effect in 11 canine cancer patients with spontaneous solid tumors by PET/CT imaging. We thereby provide the first high-resolution analysis of EPR-based tumor accumulation in large animals. We find that the EPR-effect is strong in some tumor types but cannot be considered a general feature of solid malignant tumors since we observed a high degree of accumulation heterogeneity between tumors. Six of seven included carcinomas displayed high uptake levels of liposomes, whereas one of four sarcomas displayed signs of liposome retention. We conclude that nanocarrier-radiotracers could be important in identifying cancer patients that will benefit from nanocarrier-based therapeutics in clinical practice.",

            "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Intracranial meningiomas are the most common considered benign tumors of the central nervous system with clinically aggressive behavior. Meningiomas account for up to 36% of all brain tumors. Metastases, are highly malignant brain lesions with an undetermined incidence of World Health Organization. It is believed that up to 30% of adult patients with cancer of\u00a0one localization or another suffer from secondary tumors of the brain. The vast majority of meningiomas originate from the coverings of the brain, and more than 90% are solitary. Intracranial meningeal metastases occur in 8\u20139%, and in 10% the brain is the only secondary tumor site, and in 50% of cases metastases are solitary. Usually, the task of distinguishing between meningioma and a dural metastasis does not cause difficulties. In some cases differential diagnosis between these tumors is ambiguous, since meningiomas and dural solitary metastases (dMTS) may have similar characteristics: a cavityless solid appearance, restricted diffusion of water molecules, presence of extensive peritumoral edema, and an identical contrast enhancement pattern.OBJECTIVE: To determine the significance of multiparametric mapping (MR-perfusion and apparent diffusion coefficient) for the differential diagnosis of meningioma and solitary dural metastasis.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 100 patients with newly diagnosed CNS tumors, who subsequently underwent examination at the Meditsinskii gorod (Tyumen, Russia) with histological verification in the period from 2017 to 2022. The mean age of the patients was 54 years, the median was 58 years. Depending on the histological data, 2 groups of patients were distinguished: 1\u201350 cases with meningiomas, 2\u201350 cases with solitary meningeal metastatic lesions. The examination was performed with a General Electric Signa Voyager 1.5\u0422 MRI machine before and after contrast enhancement.Statistics. Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS (version 24.0). Gender, age, presence of dislocation of midline structures, bone invasion, and severity of perifocal edema were compared for both groups of patients using Pearson\u2019s Chi-square test. ADC, CBV, rCBV, CBF, rCBF, MTT values were compared for both groups of patients using the Mann-Whitney U test. The optimal cut-off value for sensitivity and specificity was determined by analysis of ROC curves. For all tests, the alpha level was set to p*\u22640.05, p**\u22640.01, p***\u22640.001.RESULTS: In the meningioma group, the mean ADC was 912.14\u00d710\u22126 mm2/s (SD: \u00b1102.7\u00d710\u22126 mm2/s). Median CBV was 19.25 ml/100g (CI: 18.08\u201328.96 ml/100g), median increase in rCBV was 4.1-fold (SD: 4.09\u20135.46). Median CBF was 155 ml/100g/min (SD: 157.48\u2013206.65 ml/100g/min), median increase in rCBF was 3.85-fold (SD: 3.98\u20135.28). Median MTT was 11 seconds (SD: 10.18\u201311.29 seconds). In the metastasis group, the mean ADC was 867.67\u00d710\u22126 mm2/s (SD: \u00b1138.6\u00d710\u22126 mm2/s). Median CBV was 39.85 ml/100g SDI: 36.50\u201346.83 ml/100g), median increase in rCBV was 7.15-fold (SD: 6.64\u20137.80). Median CBF was 293 ml/100g/min SDI: 261.65\u2013306.12 ml/100g/min), median increase in rCBF was 6.7-fold (SD: 5.97\u20136.93). Median MTT is 10.85 seconds (SD: 10.15\u201310.86 seconds).The cut-off value for CBV was 28.25 ml/100g. The sensitivity and specificity of the method are 76.5% and 78%, respectively. The cut-off value for rCBV was 5.4. The sensitivity and specificity of the method are 74.5% and 82%, respectively.The threshold value of the CBF was 217.9 ml/100g/min. The sensitivity and specificity of the method are 80.4% and 86%, respectively.The cut-off value for rCBF was 5.6. The sensitivity and specificity of the method are 82.4% and 76%, respectively.DISCUSSION: Based on the results of the study, it was found that the use of mpMRI in the differential diagnosis of meningiomas and dural SMTS is limited by the similarity of the apparent diffusion coefficient values. The assumption, previously put forward in the literature, about the presence of a statistically significant difference in ADC values that allow to differentiate these tumors, was not confirmed. When analyzing perfusion data, dural SMTS showed higher CBF values compared to meningiomas (p<0.001). A threshold value of the CBF was determined, which amounted to 217.9 ml/100 g/min, above which it is possible to predict dural SMTS with a sensitivity and specificity of 80 and 86%.CONCLUSION: Diffusion-weighted images are not reliable criteria for differentiating meningiomas from dural SMTS and should not influence the diagnosis suggested by imaging. The meningeal lesion perfusion technique predicts metastasis with a sensitivity and specificity close to 80\u201390% and deserves attention in making a diagnosis. Since dural MTS differ from meningiomas in the severity of neoangiogenesis and, accordingly, in greater vascular permeability, the technique for assessing vascular permeability (the wash-in parameter with dynamic contrast enhancement) can potentially be a clarifying criterion for distinguishing between dural lesions.\u00a0",

A threshold value of the CBF was determined, which amounted to 217.9 ml/100 g/min, above which it is possible to predict dural SMTS with a sensitivity and specificity of 80 and 86%.CONCLUSION: Diffusion-weighted images are not reliable criteria for differentiating meningiomas from dural SMTS and should not influence the diagnosis suggested by imaging. The meningeal lesion perfusion technique predicts metastasis with a sensitivity and specificity close to 80\u201390% and deserves attention in making a diagnosis. Since dural MTS differ from meningiomas in the severity of neoangiogenesis and, accordingly, in greater vascular permeability, the technique for assessing vascular permeability (the wash-in parameter with dynamic contrast enhancement) can potentially be a clarifying criterion for distinguishing between dural lesions.\u00a0",

This feature is exploited in cancer therapy to enhance tumor accumulation of macromolecules. The molecules first pass the endothelial barrier followed by movement through the tumor interstitium and extracellular matrix before they reach the tumor cells. Generally, compounds greater than 40 kDa benefit from the EPR effect and can accumulate at the tumor site. An additional benefit of these macromolecules is their prolonged circulation time compared to smaller molecules that are rapidly cleared by the liver and kidneys [49]. While targeted molecules have tumor targeting abilities, their initial diffusion from the vasculature into the tumor tissue relies on the EPR effect like untargeted molecules. Due to the inter-and intra-patient heterogeneity of the EPR effect, treatment efficacy varies between patients, leading to dissimilar outcomes in clinical trials. The EPR effect is so heterologous because multiple vascular as well as micro-environmental factors contribute to the EPR. At the vascular level, main contributors are vascular permeability, expression of endothelial receptors and the degree of vascular maturation (as tumors rapidly enhance angiogenesis the maturation state is significantly different from healthy tissues). Micro-environmental contributors include the extracellular matrix, presence of hypoxia, interstitial fluid pressure and tumor cell density [90]. When taking into account all these different contributors, one can imagine the complexity and understand the heterogeneous nature. Because of this EPR heterogeneity, antibodies provide an opportunity for active targeting that can enhance the passive targeting of the EPR effect.",

Given reported recurrence rates, improvements are clearly still necessary. A major factor limiting the efficacy of antibody-targeted cancer therapies may be the incomplete penetration of the antibody or antibody\u2013drug conjugate into the tumor. Incomplete tumor penetration also affects the outcome of molecular imaging, when using such targeting agents. From the injection site until they arrive inside the tumor, targeting molecules are faced with several barriers that impact intratumoral distribution. The primary means of antibody transport inside tumors is based on diffusion. The diffusive penetration inside the tumor is influenced by both antibody properties, such as size and binding affinity, as well as tumor properties, such as microenvironment, vascularization, and targeted antigen availability. Engineering smaller antibody fragments has shown to improve the rate of tumor uptake and intratumoral distribution. However, it is often accompanied by more rapid clearance from the body and in several cases also by inherent destabilization and reduction of the binding affinity of the antibody. In this perspective, we discuss different cancer targeting approaches based on antibodies or their fragments. We carefully consider how their size and binding properties influence their intratumoral uptake and distribution, and how this may affect cancer imaging and therapy of solid tumors."

These materials have evolved from their earlier use as biodegradable products such as resorbable sutures, orthopaedic implants, macroscale and microscale drug delivery systems such as microparticles and wafers used as controlled drug release depots, to multifunctional nanoparticles (NPs) capable of targeting, and controlled release of therapeutic and diagnostic agents. These newer generations of targeted and controlled release polymeric NPs are now engineered to navigate the complex in vivo environment, and incorporate functionalities for achieving target specificity, control of drug concentration and exposure kinetics at the tissue, cell, and subcellular levels. Indeed this optimization of drug pharmacology as aided by careful design of multifunctional NPs can lead to improved drug safety and efficacy, and may be complimentary to drug enhancements that are traditionally achieved by medicinal chemistry. In this regard, polymeric NPs have the potential to result in a highly differentiated new class of therapeutics, distinct from the original active drugs used in their composition, and distinct from first generation NPs that largely facilitated drug formulation. A greater flexibility in the design of drug molecules themselves may also be facilitated following their incorporation into NPs, as drug properties (solubility, metabolism, plasma binding, biodistribution, target tissue accumulation) will no longer be constrained to the same extent by drug chemical composition, but also become in-part the function of the physicochemical properties of the NP. The combination of optimally designed drugs with optimally engineered polymeric NPs opens up the possibility of improved clinical outcomes that may not be achievable with the administration of drugs in their conventional form. In this critical review, we aim to provide insights into the design and development of targeted polymeric NPs and to highlight the challenges associated with the engineering of this novel class of therapeutics, including considerations of NP design optimization, development and biophysicochemical properties. Additionally, we highlight some recent examples from the literature, which demonstrate current trends and novel concepts in both the design and utility of targeted polymeric NPs (444 references)."

However, despite the sound pharmacologic basis, many liposomal as well as other nanoparticle-based drug formulations have failed to meet regulatory criteria for approval. The question that arises is whether we have missed key liposome\u2013host interactions that can account for the gap between the major pharmacologic advantages in preclinical studies and the modest impact of the clinical effects in humans. We will discuss here the nanoparticle\u2013immune system interactions that may undermine the antitumor effect of the nanodrug formulations and contribute to this gap. To overcome this challenge and increase clinical translation, new preclinical models need to be adopted along with comprehensive immunopharmacologic studies and strategies for patient selection in the clinical phase."

Thus, there are some structural and functional differences between the cancer and normal blood vessels. To study cancer characteristics or therapeutic efficacy, the blood vessel properties and the cancer-endothelial cell interaction are important to consider.

High metastatic tumor-derived TEC (HM-TEC) and low metastatic tumor-derived TEC (LM-TEC) can be isolated from mice.

The expression and activity of EGF receptors in endothelial cells are less well characterized. Analysis of tumor-derived endothelial cells showed that they express EGFR, ErbB2, and ErbB4, whereas their normal counterparts express ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4. The gain in expression of EGFR and the loss of ErbB3 expression in tumor vasculature was also observed in vivo. As a consequence of their expressing EGFR, tumor endothelial cells responded to EGF and other EGF family members by activating both EGFR and ErbB2, by activating the downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, and by enhanced proliferation. On the other hand, normal endothelial cells did not respond to EGF but instead were responsive to neuregulin (NRG), a ligand for ErbB3 and ErbB4. NRG activated ErbB3 in normal endothelial cells and inhibited growth of these cells. In contrast, tumor endothelial cells, which do not express ErbB3, were not growth inhibited by NRG. Furthermore, due to their expression of EGFR, tumor endothelial cells, unlike normal endothelial cells, are direct targets for EGFR kinase inhibitors. These low-molecular-weight compounds block EGF-induced EGFR activation and proliferation of tumor endothelial cells. These results suggest that a gain of EGF-induced endothelial cell proliferation, and loss of NRG-induced growth inhibition in tumor endothelial cells constitutes a switch that promotes tumor angiogenesis. In addition, these results suggest that EGFR kinase inhibitors may be effective for antiangiogenesis therapy by specifically targeting the tumor, but not the normal, vasculature.",

Yet, chromosomal aberration in human tumor-associated ECs (hTECs) in carcinoma has not yet been investigated. Here we isolated TECs from 20 human renal cell carcinomas and analyzed their cytogenetic abnormalities. The degree of aneuploidy was analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization using chromosome 7 and chromosome 8 DNA probes in isolated hTECs. In human renal cell carcinomas, 22-58% (median, 33%) of uncultured hTECs were aneuploid, whereas normal ECs were diploid. The mechanisms governing TEC aneuploidy were then studied using mouse TECs (mTECs) isolated from xenografts of human epithelial tumors. To investigate the contribution of progenitor cells to aneuploidy in mTECs, CD133(+) and CD133(-) mTECs were compared for aneuploidy. CD133(+) mTECs showed aneuploidy more frequently than CD133(-) mTECs. This is the first report showing cytogenetic abnormality of hTECs in carcinoma, contrary to traditional belief. Cytogenetic alterations in tumor vessels of carcinoma therefore can occur and may play a significant role in modifying tumor- stromal interactions.",

We have shown that tumour endothelial cells (TECs) isolated from tumour tissues are also abnormal. Furthermore, we found that mRNAs of vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) were upregulated in TECs. Vascular endothelial growth factor-A and COX-2 are angiogenic factors and their mRNAs contain an AU-rich element (ARE). AU-rich element-containing mRNAs are reportedly stabilised by Hu antigen R (HuR), which is exported to the cytoplasm.Methods:Normal endothelial cell (NEC) and two types of TECs were isolated. We evaluated the correlation of HuR and accumulation of VEGF-A and COX-2 mRNAs in TECs and effects of HuR on biological phenotypes of TECs.Results:The HuR protein was accumulated in the cytoplasm of TECs, but not in NECs. Vascular endothelial growth factor-A and COX-2 mRNA levels decreased due to HuR knockdown and it was shown that these ARE-mRNA were bound to HuR in TECs. Furthermore, HuR knockdown inhibited cell survival, random motility, tube formation, and Akt phosphorylation in TECs.Conclusion:Hu antigen R is associated with the upregulation of VEGF-A and COX-2 mRNA in TECs, and has an important role in keeping an angiogenic switch on, through activating angiogenic phenotype in tumour endothelium."

However, growing evidence suggests that it is over-represented in preclinical models, and agents designed solely using its principle of passive accumulation can only be applied to a narrow subset of clinical tumors. For this reason, strategies that can improve upon the EPR effect to facilitate nanomedicine delivery to otherwise non-responsive tumors are required for broad clinical translation. EPR-adaptive nanomedicine delivery comprises a class of chemical and physical techniques that modify tumor accessibility in an effort to increase agent delivery and therapeutic effect. In the present review, we overview the primary benefits and limitations of radiation, ultrasound, hyperthermia, and photodynamic therapy as physical strategies for EPR-adaptive delivery to EPR-insensitive tumor phenotypes, and we reflect upon changes in the preclinical research pathway that should be implemented in order to optimally validate and develop these delivery strategies."

In order to avoid the imminent consequences of hypoxia, ischemia and toxicity, this process seems to occur very quickly and as a result, the contributions of the angiogenic regulators are largely excluded. This gives rise to highly disorganized and fenestrated tumor vessels, with discontinued endothelial linings and undesirable permeability to particles of up to 700 nm in diameter (Moghimi et al., 2018)(Fang et al., 2011). This pathologically orchestrated phenomenon is referred to as enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect (Matsumura et al., 1986) (Figure 2). Maeda et al. conceptualized and clearly demonstrated how angiogenic flaws associated with rapid tumor growth promoted site-specific accumulation and retention of nanoparticle-drug conjugates at the tumor site (Matsumura et al., 1986)(Maeda, 2012). Taking advantage of the pressure gradient and leaky vessels at the tumor site, the nanoparticle-based drug accumulates at the tumor site, extravasates into the tumor microenvironment, and prolongs the release of therapeutic agents within the tumor with a resultant improvement in the treatment outcome.",

In order to avoid the imminent consequences of hypoxia, ischemia and toxicity, this process seems to occur very quickly and as a result, the contributions of the angiogenic regulators are largely excluded. This gives rise to highly disorganized and fenestrated tumor vessels, with discontinued endothelial linings and undesirable permeability to particles of up to 700 nm in diameter (Moghimi et al., 2018)(Fang et al., 2011). This pathologically orchestrated phenomenon is referred to as enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect (Matsumura et al., 1986) (Figure 2). Maeda et al. conceptualized and clearly demonstrated how angiogenic flaws associated with rapid tumor growth promoted site-specific accumulation and retention of nanoparticle-drug conjugates at the tumor site (Matsumura et al., 1986)(Maeda, 2012). Taking advantage of the pressure gradient and leaky vessels at the tumor site, the nanoparticle-based drug accumulates at the tumor site, extravasates into the tumor microenvironment, and prolongs the release of therapeutic agents within the tumor with a resultant improvement in the treatment outcome."

Pathological, pharmacological, and biochemical studies have shown that a solid tumor usually has such pathophysiological characteristics as hypervascularization, incomplete vascular architecture, and secretion of vascular permeability factors that stimulate extravasation and immaturity of lymphatic capillaries [15]. The tumor vasculature is characterized by a high proportion of proliferating endothelial cells, increased tortuosity, pericyte deficiency, and the formation of an atypical membrane. All this leads to rapid vascularization of the tumor, which is necessary to provide it with oxygen and nutrients and further proliferation. These characteristics make tumor blood vessels permeable to macromolecules. In addition, the lymphatic drainage system of the tumor functions ineffectively due to immature lymphatic capillaries; thus, nanocarriers are selectively preserved for a long period in the interstitial tissue of the tumor [15]. Numerous studies have shown that the EPR effect induces passive accumulation of macromolecules and micelles in solid tumors, enhancing the therapeutic effect while reducing side effects. It was also found that in most human tumors the effective pore size in the vasculature ranges from 200 to 600 nm in diameter, which allows passive targeting of tumors [16]. It was noted that the secretion of various factors such as nitric oxide, prostaglandins, bradykinin, and the main growth factor of fibroblasts in tumor tissues and overexpression of genes (such as vascular permeability factor or vascular endothelial growth factor) cause hyperpermeability of tumor microvessels. However, let us note that vascular permeability in the tumor changes with its progression and depends on the type of tumor and its anatomical location.",

Due to their unique features, including a large surface area, structural properties, and a long circulation time in blood compared with small molecules, a plethora of nanomaterials has been developed, with the potential to revolutionize the diagnosis and treatment of several diseases, in particular by improving the sensitivity and recognition ability of imaging contrast agents and by selectively directing bioactive agents to biological targets. Focusing on cancer, promising nanoprototypes have been designed to overcome the lack of specificity of conventional chemotherapeutic agents, as well as for early detection of precancerous and malignant lesions. However, several obstacles, including difficulty in achieving the optimal combination of physicochemical parameters for tumor targeting, evading particle clearance mechanisms, and controlling drug release, prevent the translation of nanomedicines into therapy. In spite of this, recent efforts have been focused on developing functionalized nanoparticles for delivery of therapeutic agents to specific molecular targets overexpressed on different cancer cells. In particular, the combination of targeted and controlled-release polymer nanotechnologies has resulted in a new programmable nanotherapeutic formulation of docetaxel, namely BIND-014, which recently entered Phase II clinical testing for patients with solid tumors. BIND-014 has been developed to overcome the limitations facing delivery of nanoparticles to many neoplasms, and represents a validated example of targeted nanosystems with the optimal biophysicochemical properties needed for successful tumor eradication.",

We show that blood vessels in both a xenografted tumor and primary human tumors contain a sizable fraction of immature blood vessels that have not yet recruited periendothelial cells. These immature vessels are selectively obliterated as a consequence of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) withdrawal. In a xenografted glioma, the selective vulnerability of immature vessels to VEGF loss was demonstrated by downregulating VEGF transgene expression using a tetracycline-regulated expression system. In human prostate cancer, the constitutive production of VEGF by the glandular epithelium was suppressed as a consequence of androgen-ablation therapy. VEGF loss led, in turn, to selective apoptosis of endothelial cells in vessels devoid of periendothelial cells. These results suggest that the unique dependence on VEGF of blood vessels lacking periendothelial cells can be exploited to reduce an existing tumor vasculature."

As EVs are a type of nanoparticle, it is plausible that they may be subject to EPR (Phillips et al., 2021). EPR is observed in various solid tumors, and is characterized by abnormal tumor vasculature, tumor permeability, and a lack of effective lymphatic drainage (Wu, 2021). The leaky tumor vasculature allows for nanoparticles to extravasate through surrounding blood vessels (Maeda et al., 2013). Together, these function to help nanoparticles persist and accumulate in tumors, allowing for retention and direct delivery to the site of interest (Wu, 2021)."

Over the past several decades, remarkable progress has been made in the development and application of engineered nanoparticles to treat cancer more effectively. For example, therapeutic agents have been integrated with nanoparticles engineered with optimal sizes, shapes, and surface properties to increase their solubility, prolong their circulation half-life, improve their biodistribution, and reduce their immunogenicity. Nanoparticles and their payloads have also been favorably delivered into tumors by taking advantage of the pathophysiological conditions, such as the enhanced permeability and retention effect, and the spatial variations in the pH\u2005value. Additionally, targeting ligands (e.g., small organic molecules, peptides, antibodies, and nucleic acids) have been added to the surface of nanoparticles to specifically target cancerous cells through selective binding to the receptors overexpressed on their surface. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that multiple types of therapeutic drugs and/or diagnostic agents (e.g., contrast agents) could be delivered through the same carrier to enable combination therapy with a potential to overcome multidrug resistance, and real-time readout on the treatment efficacy. It is anticipated that precisely engineered nanoparticles will emerge as the next-generation platform for cancer therapy and many other biomedical applications."

Nanosized drugs have a large loading capacity, the ability to protect the payload from degradation, a large surface on which to conjugate targeting ligands, and controlled or sustained release. Nanosized drugs also leak preferentially into tumor tissue through permeable tumor vessels and are then retained in the tumor bed due to reduced lymphatic drainage. This process is known as the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. However, while the EPR effect is widely held to improve delivery of nanodrugs to tumors, it in fact offers less than a 2-fold increase in nanodrug delivery compared with critical normal organs, resulting in drug concentrations that are not sufficient for curing most cancers. In this Review, we first overview various barriers for nanosized drug delivery with an emphasis on the capillary wall's resistance, the main obstacle to delivering drugs. Then, we discuss current regulatory issues facing nanomedicine. Finally, we discuss how to make the delivery of nanosized drugs to tumors more effective by building on the EPR effect.",

They showed that tumor tissues had defective blood vessels with aberrant branching and large openings between endothelial cells of around 400 nm due to their rapid proliferation and decreased number of pericytes. This unique characteristic helps macromolecules, such as nanocarriers, easily move into tumor tissues after crossing the endothelium barrier. Furthermore, solid tumors have a poor lymphatic drainage system, leading to extended retention times of nanocarriers in the tumor extracellular matrix."

However, only a small fraction of an intravenously administered anti\u2010cancer drug enters the lymphatic system to reach metastatic lymph nodes (LN). Here, we show that the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect is not induced during the early stages of LN metastasis. Luciferase\u2010expressing tumor cells were injected into the subiliac LN of the MXH10/Mo\u2010lpr/lpr mouse to induce metastasis to the proper axillary LN (PALN). In vivo biofluorescence imaging was used to confirm metastasis induction and to quantify the EPR effect, measured as PALN accumulation of intravenously injected indocyanine green (ICG) liposomes. PALN blood vessel volume changes were measured by contrast\u2010enhanced high\u2010frequency ultrasound imaging. The volume and density of blood vessels in the PALN increased until day 29 after inoculation, whereas the LN volume remained constant. ICG retention was first detected on day 29 post\u2010inoculation. While CD31\u2010positive cells increased up to day 29 post\u2010inoculation, \u03b1\u2010smooth muscle actin\u2010positive cells were detected on day 29 post\u2010inoculation for the first time. These results suggest that the EPR effect was not induced in the early stages of LN metastasis; therefore, systemic chemotherapy would likely not be beneficial during the early stages of LN metastasis. The development of an alternative drug delivery system, independent of the EPR effect, is required for the treatment of LN metastasis.",

The field has been devoted to treatment of cancer by exploiting EPR-based accumulation of nanocarriers in solid tumors, which for many years was considered to be a ubiquitous phenomenon. However, the understanding of differences in the EPR-effect between tumor types, heterogeneities within each patient group, and dependency on tumor development stage in humans is sparse. It is therefore important to enhance our understanding of the EPR-effect in large animals and humans with spontaneously developed cancer. In the present paper, we describe a novel loading method of copper-64 into PEGylated liposomes and use these liposomes to evaluate the EPR-effect in 11 canine cancer patients with spontaneous solid tumors by PET/CT imaging. We thereby provide the first high-resolution analysis of EPR-based tumor accumulation in large animals. We find that the EPR-effect is strong in some tumor types but cannot be considered a general feature of solid malignant tumors since we observed a high degree of accumulation heterogeneity between tumors. Six of seven included carcinomas displayed high uptake levels of liposomes, whereas one of four sarcomas displayed signs of liposome retention. We conclude that nanocarrier-radiotracers could be important in identifying cancer patients that will benefit from nanocarrier-based therapeutics in clinical practice."

Nanosized drugs have a large loading capacity, the ability to protect the payload from degradation, a large surface on which to conjugate targeting ligands, and controlled or sustained release. Nanosized drugs also leak preferentially into tumor tissue through permeable tumor vessels and are then retained in the tumor bed due to reduced lymphatic drainage. This process is known as the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. However, while the EPR effect is widely held to improve delivery of nanodrugs to tumors, it in fact offers less than a 2-fold increase in nanodrug delivery compared with critical normal organs, resulting in drug concentrations that are not sufficient for curing most cancers. In this Review, we first overview various barriers for nanosized drug delivery with an emphasis on the capillary wall's resistance, the main obstacle to delivering drugs. Then, we discuss current regulatory issues facing nanomedicine. Finally, we discuss how to make the delivery of nanosized drugs to tumors more effective by building on the EPR effect."

A deficiency of the lymphatic system leads to the retention of the nanoparticles in the tumor. This retention is known as the enhanced retention effect. Both the phenomena are collectively known as the EPR effect (Nakamura et al., 2016). Using this EPR effect, the concentration of anti-cancer drugs in the tumor could be increased many times compared to the healthy tissue of the body."

This will provide necessary context for understanding the rest of the answer.\n\n2.

EPR Effect in Benign vs. Malignant Tumors - This should be a synthesis paragraph comparing how the EPR effect differs between benign and malignant tumors, and the implications for metastasis.\n\n5. EPR Effect and Metastasis - This should be a synthesis paragraph focusing specifically on the relationship between the EPR effect and the metastatic process, including evidence from the quotes that directly addresses this relationship.\n\n6. Heterogeneity and Limitations of the EPR Effect - This should be a synthesis paragraph discussing the variability of the EPR effect across different tumor types, stages, and locations, which impacts its influence on metastatic potential.\n\n7. Implications for Cancer Treatment - This should be a synthesis paragraph discussing how understanding the EPR effect in relation to metastasis impacts cancer treatment strategies.\n\nLet me now assign quotes to each dimension:\n\nIntroduction/Background on EPR Effect:\nQuotes [0], [7], [13], [15], [22] provide good background information on the EPR effect, its discovery by Matsumura and Maeda, and its basic definition.\n\nMechanism of the EPR Effect:\nQuotes [1], [2], [3], [5], [6], [11], [14], [20], [25] explain the mechanisms behind the EPR effect, including details about angiogenesis, vascular permeability, and lymphatic drainage.\n\nEPR Effect in Malignant Solid Tumors:\nQuotes [0], [9], [10], [12], [16], [17], [29], [33], [35] discuss how the EPR effect manifests in malignant tumors.\n\nEPR Effect in Benign vs. Malignant Tumors:\nI don't see quotes directly comparing benign and malignant tumors in terms of the EPR effect.

This effect stems from the unique characteristics of solid tumors, which exhibit angiogenesis, rapid growth, and metastatic potential <Paper corpusId=\"13707720\" paperTitle=\"(Wu et al., 2001)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe EPR effect is primarily driven by two key mechanisms. First, tumor blood vessels develop with structural abnormalities, including deficient basement membranes and fenestrated endothelial tubes, which increase vascular permeability and allow macromolecules to leak from the bloodstream into tumor tissues <Paper corpusId=\"256595759\" paperTitle=\"(Abballe et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"3163532\" paperTitle=\"(Benjamin et al., 1999)\" isShortName></Paper>. Second, solid tumors typically lack efficient lymphatic drainage systems, resulting in the prolonged retention of these macromolecules within the tumor microenvironment <Paper corpusId=\"235200480\" paperTitle=\"(Matsumura, 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThese pathophysiological properties allow macromolecular substances that normally cannot pass through healthy blood vessels to easily penetrate tumor vasculature. Additionally, once these substances enter the tumor tissue, they remain there for extended periods due to insufficient lymphatic clearance <Paper corpusId=\"235200480\" paperTitle=\"(Matsumura, 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. Consequently, large molecules and nanoparticles (typically above 40 kDa) can progressively accumulate in vascularized tumor areas, providing a mechanism for passive targeting of anticancer compounds <Paper corpusId=\"237330183\" paperTitle=\"(Wu, 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe EPR effect has become a fundamental principle in the design of nanomedicines for cancer treatment, as it enables selective drug delivery to tumor tissues through passive accumulation without affecting normal tissues <Paper corpusId=\"221166257\" paperTitle=\"(Gerosa et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. However, it is important to note that the strength of the EPR effect varies considerably depending on tumor type, location, blood perfusion status, and the physicochemical properties of the macromolecular agents <Paper corpusId=\"237330183\" paperTitle=\"(Wu, 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. Additionally, some tumors exhibit an EPR-insensitive phenotype characterized by smaller endothelial fenestrations, heterogeneous pericyte coverage, more developed vasculature, denser extracellular matrix, and more developed immune profiles, which can limit the effectiveness of EPR-based drug delivery strategies <Paper corpusId=\"232775475\" paperTitle=\"(Kim et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"204826101\" paperTitle=\"(Dhaliwal et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>.",

They named this the EPR effect (enhanced permeability and retention), the mechanism by which large molecules accumulate in tumors. Based on the EPR effect, pharmaceutical nanoparticles with a higher circulation time in the blood are collected in tumor tissues with enhanced vascular permeability, and this tool is commonly used for selective drug delivery into tumors through passive accumulation. In fact, EPR drug delivery does not work on normal tissues (Torchilin, 2011)."

EPR effect is usually induced by a leaky tumor vasculature by the accelerated angiogenesis and impaired lymphatic drainage by the disorganized growth of tumors (Greish, 2010)(Dhaliwal et al., 2019). In details, NPs with appropriate sizes can evade the tumor capillaries and be retained in the tumor tissues for days due to the lack of lymphatic drainage. Additionally, particles with high positive charges can bind non-specifically to the negatively charged luminal surface due to the presence of sulfate and carboxylate sugar moieties [106]",
                            "Furthermore, a key challenge is the promotion of the EPR effect in patients with EPR-insensitive tumor phenotypes since the EPR-insensitive phenotype is known to have smaller endothelial fenestrations, heterogeneously high or low pericyte coverage, more developed and branched vasculatures, a relatively dense ECR, and more developed immune profiles compared to EPR sensitive phenotypes (Dhaliwal et al., 2019)."

We show that blood vessels in both a xenografted tumor and primary human tumors contain a sizable fraction of immature blood vessels that have not yet recruited periendothelial cells. These immature vessels are selectively obliterated as a consequence of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) withdrawal. In a xenografted glioma, the selective vulnerability of immature vessels to VEGF loss was demonstrated by downregulating VEGF transgene expression using a tetracycline-regulated expression system. In human prostate cancer, the constitutive production of VEGF by the glandular epithelium was suppressed as a consequence of androgen-ablation therapy. VEGF loss led, in turn, to selective apoptosis of endothelial cells in vessels devoid of periendothelial cells. These results suggest that the unique dependence on VEGF of blood vessels lacking periendothelial cells can be exploited to reduce an existing tumor vasculature."

As a result, highly stable macromolecular substances that are not captured by the reticuloendothelial systems in the body and are not filtered from the renal glomerulus can accumulate selectively in cancer tissue.

                            "Chemotherapy for human solid tumors in clinical practice is far from satisfactory. Despite the discovery and synthesis of hundreds of thousands of anticancer compounds targeting various crucial units in cancer cell proliferation and metabolism, the fundamental problem is the lack of targeting delivery of these compounds selectively into solid tumor tissue to maintain an effective concentration level for a certain length of time for drug-tumor interaction to execute anticancer activities. The enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR effect) describes a universal pathophysiological phenomenon and mechanism in which macromolecular compounds such as albumin and other polymer-conjugated drugs beyond certain sizes (above 40 kDa) can progressively accumulate in the tumor vascularized area and thus achieve targeting delivery and retention of anticancer compounds into solid tumor tissue. Targeting therapy via the EPR effect in clinical practice is not always successful since the strength of the EPR effect varies depending on the type and location of tumors, status of blood perfusion in tumors, and the physical-chemical properties of macromolecular anticancer agents. This review highlights the significance of the concept and mechanism of the EPR effect and discusses methods for better utilizing the EPR effect in developing smarter macromolecular nanomedicine to achieve a satisfactory outcome in clinical applications."

However, growing evidence suggests that it is over-represented in preclinical models, and agents designed solely using its principle of passive accumulation can only be applied to a narrow subset of clinical tumors. For this reason, strategies that can improve upon the EPR effect to facilitate nanomedicine delivery to otherwise non-responsive tumors are required for broad clinical translation. EPR-adaptive nanomedicine delivery comprises a class of chemical and physical techniques that modify tumor accessibility in an effort to increase agent delivery and therapeutic effect. In the present review, we overview the primary benefits and limitations of radiation, ultrasound, hyperthermia, and photodynamic therapy as physical strategies for EPR-adaptive delivery to EPR-insensitive tumor phenotypes, and we reflect upon changes in the preclinical research pathway that should be implemented in order to optimally validate and develop these delivery strategies."

                            "The underlying mechanism, which makes passive targeting possible, is the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. \n\nIt was observed that certain circumstances, such as inflammation/hypoxia, tumors, or infarcts, can determine an enhanced permeability of the endothelial lining of the blood vessel wall compared with the normal state of the tissue (Shaji et al., 2013). When reaching a given size, a tumor can no longer rely on the normal vasculature present in its vicinity to provide all the oxygen supply needed for its further proliferation. Therefore, as oxygen-deprived cells start to die, they secrete growth factors that promote the formation of new blood vessels from the surrounding capillaries, process known as angiogenesis (Bertrand et al., 2014). These newly formed irregular blood vessels lack the basal membrane of normal vascular structures, thus presenting a discontinuous epithelium, which allows particles, such as nanocarriers (in the size range of 20-200 nm), to extravasate and accumulate inside the interstitial space (Jain et al., 2010). Following permeation into the tumor, the enhanced accumulation of nanocarriers in the tumor microenvironment is favored by the poor lymphatic drainage in the tissue. In tumors, the lymphatic function is defective, resulting in minimal uptake of the interstitial fluid. Therefore, nanocarriers that have reached the perivascular space are not cleared efficiently and accumulate in the tumor interstitium (Bertrand et al., 2014)."

In order to avoid the imminent consequences of hypoxia, ischemia and toxicity, this process seems to occur very quickly and as a result, the contributions of the angiogenic regulators are largely excluded. This gives rise to highly disorganized and fenestrated tumor vessels, with discontinued endothelial linings and undesirable permeability to particles of up to 700 nm in diameter (Moghimi et al., 2018)(Fang et al., 2011). This pathologically orchestrated phenomenon is referred to as enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect (Matsumura et al., 1986) (Figure 2). Maeda et al. conceptualized and clearly demonstrated how angiogenic flaws associated with rapid tumor growth promoted site-specific accumulation and retention of nanoparticle-drug conjugates at the tumor site (Matsumura et al., 1986)(Maeda, 2012). Taking advantage of the pressure gradient and leaky vessels at the tumor site, the nanoparticle-based drug accumulates at the tumor site, extravasates into the tumor microenvironment, and prolongs the release of therapeutic agents within the tumor with a resultant improvement in the treatment outcome."

This basic principle of enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effects to achieve passive targeting of nanoparticles to solid tumors. Because of the tight junctions in the normal endothelial cell gap, it prevents particles larger than 2 nm from passing. However, the tight junctions of the tumor vasculature and the basement membrane are disordered, allowing 10 to 500 nm NP to exude and accumulate in tumor matrix (Bertrand et al., 2014). The lymphatic system of the tumor is also damaged; further intercepting macromolecular particles and delaying their outflow (Maeda et al., 2013). So, the EPR effect allows tumors to retain more polymer NPs, proteins, liposomes and micelles than other tissues (Kamaly et al., 2012)."

In fact, depending on the anatomic region of a tumor, the pore size of the endothelial junctions varies from 100 to 780 nm with a mean of approximately 400 nm (while normal vasculature is characterized by pores smaller than 10 nm), characterizing the leaky microvasculature of tumors; it is also characterized by a disrupted basement membrane, abnormal branching, and enlarged inter-endothelial gaps, with an associated breakdown of tight junctions between endothelial cells. Moreover, tumor vasculature lacks lymphatic drainage and is rich in fenestrations and poor in pericyte coverage. All these features contribute to the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, firstly described by Maeda and co-workers (Maeda et al., 2013); the tumor vasculature architecture allows extravasation and selective accumulation of nanodrugs in the tumor interstice via a passive targeting mechanism (Sanna et al., 2014)(Bertrand et al., 2014)(Aghebati-Maleki et al., 2019)."

Due to this, the nanoparticles can leak between the gaps and enter the tumor. This stage is referring to the enhanced permeability of the EPR effect. It should be noted that solid tumor has poor lymphatic drainage. Molecules smaller than 4 nm can diffuse back to the bloodstream, but the nanoparticles are impeded due to their larger particle size, thus retain in the solid tumor.

                            "Neovascularization is essential for tumor progression, to ensure an adequate supply of oxygen and nutrients which support their growth. The imbalance of angiogenic regulators create an abnormal vascular network of tumor tissue that is highly disorganized and characterized by dilated, leaky blood vessels and exhibiting poor lymphatic drainage (Nakamura et al., 2014). Such unique pathophysiologic properties of tumor vasculature provide nanosized drug carriers with long circulation time. For example, PEGylated liposomes were leaked and retained specifically into tumor tissues rather than normal ones. Consequently, reduced drug toxicity is expected when using PEGylated liposomes containing anticancer drugs. This process is known as enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR) and is extensively exploited to achieve passive targeting of chemotherapeutic agents (Nakamura et al., 2014)(Andriyanov et al., 2017)(Buyens et al., 2012). EPR was described for the first time by Maeda and co-workers (Blanco et al., 2015). Also, it is demonstrated that EPR effect is the major mechanism for the selective accumulation of nanotherapeutics in tumors (La\u2010Beck et al., 2017)",
                            "On the other hand, tumor properties like tumor size, type of cancer and extent of tumor vasculature have a great effect on the extent of extravasation and tumor accumulation of PEGylated liposomes [45]."

                            "Due to the rapid growth of tumors, the surrounding blood vessels have a defective architecture and in some cases produce various permeability factors to ensure sufficient influx of oxygen and nutrients [89]. This feature is exploited in cancer therapy to enhance tumor accumulation of macromolecules. The molecules first pass the endothelial barrier followed by movement through the tumor interstitium and extracellular matrix before they reach the tumor cells. Generally, compounds greater than 40 kDa benefit from the EPR effect and can accumulate at the tumor site. An additional benefit of these macromolecules is their prolonged circulation time compared to smaller molecules that are rapidly cleared by the liver and kidneys [49]. While targeted molecules have tumor targeting abilities, their initial diffusion from the vasculature into the tumor tissue relies on the EPR effect like untargeted molecules. Due to the inter-and intra-patient heterogeneity of the EPR effect, treatment efficacy varies between patients, leading to dissimilar outcomes in clinical trials. The EPR effect is so heterologous because multiple vascular as well as micro-environmental factors contribute to the EPR. At the vascular level, main contributors are vascular permeability, expression of endothelial receptors and the degree of vascular maturation (as tumors rapidly enhance angiogenesis the maturation state is significantly different from healthy tissues). Micro-environmental contributors include the extracellular matrix, presence of hypoxia, interstitial fluid pressure and tumor cell density [90]. When taking into account all these different contributors, one can imagine the complexity and understand the heterogeneous nature. Because of this EPR heterogeneity, antibodies provide an opportunity for active targeting that can enhance the passive targeting of the EPR effect."

However, although it sounds somewhat simplistic at first, EPR is a very complex process that can be influenced by several biological actions made by the systematic distribution of nanoparticles. Interactions between proteins and nanoparticles, blood flow, and the tumor microenvironment are all factors that can influence EPR. The EPR effect can also be manipulated by the nanoparticles' features, such as their dimensions, shape, surface properties, porosity, and structure (Shi et al., 2016)."

Over the past several decades, remarkable progress has been made in the development and application of engineered nanoparticles to treat cancer more effectively. For example, therapeutic agents have been integrated with nanoparticles engineered with optimal sizes, shapes, and surface properties to increase their solubility, prolong their circulation half-life, improve their biodistribution, and reduce their immunogenicity. Nanoparticles and their payloads have also been favorably delivered into tumors by taking advantage of the pathophysiological conditions, such as the enhanced permeability and retention effect, and the spatial variations in the pH\u2005value. Additionally, targeting ligands (e.g., small organic molecules, peptides, antibodies, and nucleic acids) have been added to the surface of nanoparticles to specifically target cancerous cells through selective binding to the receptors overexpressed on their surface. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that multiple types of therapeutic drugs and/or diagnostic agents (e.g., contrast agents) could be delivered through the same carrier to enable combination therapy with a potential to overcome multidrug resistance, and real-time readout on the treatment efficacy. It is anticipated that precisely engineered nanoparticles will emerge as the next-generation platform for cancer therapy and many other biomedical applications."

However, the EPR effect varies significantly across tumor types, stages, and locations, with some tumors like pancreatic cancer showing limited EPR-based accumulation due to dense extracellular matrix. (9 sources)",
                "text": "\nSolid tumors exhibit unique pathophysiological characteristics that facilitate the EPR effect, including angiogenesis, rapid growth, and metastasis. The enhanced permeability of tumor blood vessels is not merely a side effect but actually a prerequisite for rapid tumor growth, as it allows tumors to meet their substantial demands for nutrients and oxygen <Paper corpusId=\"13707720\" paperTitle=\"(Wu et al., 2001)\" isShortName></Paper>. This enhanced permeability stems from the abnormal development of tumor vasculature, which grows rapidly to support the expanding tumor mass.\n\nThe vasculature in malignant tumors is structurally distinct from normal blood vessels. Tumor blood vessels are characterized by excessive leakiness with large fenestrations measuring 100-800 nm in diameter <Paper corpusId=\"231776619\" paperTitle=\"(Gagliardi et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. Additionally, these vessels exhibit discontinuous epithelium, increased tortuosity, pericyte deficiency, and atypical membrane formation <Paper corpusId=\"237459096\" paperTitle=\"(Sedush et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. The aberrant branching and large openings between endothelial cells are consequences of rapid proliferation and decreased pericyte coverage <Paper corpusId=\"267086100\" paperTitle=\"(Garcia-Dominguez et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. These structural abnormalities allow macromolecules and nanoparticles to more easily penetrate tumor tissues than normal tissues, where the vasculature remains intact and less permeable <Paper corpusId=\"55688965\" paperTitle=\"(Babu et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nSeveral molecular mechanisms contribute to the hyperpermeability of tumor blood vessels. Tumors secrete various factors such as nitric oxide, prostaglandins, bradykinin, and fibroblast growth factors. Additionally, they overexpress genes related to vascular permeability factor and vascular endothelial growth factor, all of which promote the hyperpermeability of tumor microvessels <Paper corpusId=\"237459096\" paperTitle=\"(Sedush et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. This enhanced vascular permeability, coupled with dysfunctional lymphatic drainage, creates an environment where nanoparticles can accumulate at levels 10-200 times higher than in normal tissues <Paper corpusId=\"227260630\" paperTitle=\"(Fu et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nWhile the EPR effect provides a foundation for passive targeting of nanomedicines to solid tumors, it is important to recognize that its effectiveness varies considerably across different tumor types. For instance, hypovascular tumors such as prostate or pancreatic cancers show limited EPR-based accumulation <Paper corpusId=\"231776619\" paperTitle=\"(Gagliardi et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. Pancreatic ductal carcinoma, in particular, is characterized by a very dense extracellular matrix that restricts the EPR effect <Paper corpusId=\"226219426\" paperTitle=\"(Gaspar et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. Analysis of 200 different patient tumors across eight cancer types revealed marked differences in tumor vasculature and morphology not only between tumor types but also between tumors of the same type and even within individual tumors <Paper corpusId=\"226219426\" paperTitle=\"(Gaspar et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nFurthermore, the EPR effect depends on the stage of tumor development. Very early-stage tumors, small metastasized cancers, and blood cancers typically exhibit insignificant or no EPR effect <Paper corpusId=\"227260630\" paperTitle=\"(Fu et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. Early-stage tumors often have more regular vasculature that prevents effective passive targeting <Paper corpusId=\"235383131\" paperTitle=\"(Gunaydin et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. Additionally, vascular permeability changes as tumors progress and varies depending on the tumor's anatomical location <Paper corpusId=\"237459096\" paperTitle=\"(Sedush et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nIn solid tumors such as lung cancer, the presence of highly fenestrated blood vessels facilitates the enhanced entry of colloidal nanoparticles, while the poor lymphatic flow contributes to their retention within the tumor site <Paper corpusId=\"55688965\" paperTitle=\"(Babu et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper>. The high vascular density resulting from angiogenesis in solid tumors, combined with the large gaps between endothelial cells, enables selective extravasation and retention of macromolecular drugs <Paper corpusId=\"62886804\" paperTitle=\"(Gajbhiye et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>.",

                            "Passive targeting to solid tumors can be achieved through the enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR effect), as first described in the 1980s [13,14]. Pathological, pharmacological, and biochemical studies have shown that a solid tumor usually has such pathophysiological characteristics as hypervascularization, incomplete vascular architecture, and secretion of vascular permeability factors that stimulate extravasation and immaturity of lymphatic capillaries [15]. The tumor vasculature is characterized by a high proportion of proliferating endothelial cells, increased tortuosity, pericyte deficiency, and the formation of an atypical membrane. All this leads to rapid vascularization of the tumor, which is necessary to provide it with oxygen and nutrients and further proliferation. These characteristics make tumor blood vessels permeable to macromolecules. In addition, the lymphatic drainage system of the tumor functions ineffectively due to immature lymphatic capillaries; thus, nanocarriers are selectively preserved for a long period in the interstitial tissue of the tumor [15]. Numerous studies have shown that the EPR effect induces passive accumulation of macromolecules and micelles in solid tumors, enhancing the therapeutic effect while reducing side effects. It was also found that in most human tumors the effective pore size in the vasculature ranges from 200 to 600 nm in diameter, which allows passive targeting of tumors [16]. It was noted that the secretion of various factors such as nitric oxide, prostaglandins, bradykinin, and the main growth factor of fibroblasts in tumor tissues and overexpression of genes (such as vascular permeability factor or vascular endothelial growth factor) cause hyperpermeability of tumor microvessels. However, let us note that vascular permeability in the tumor changes with its progression and depends on the type of tumor and its anatomical location."

They showed that tumor tissues had defective blood vessels with aberrant branching and large openings between endothelial cells of around 400 nm due to their rapid proliferation and decreased number of pericytes. This unique characteristic helps macromolecules, such as nanocarriers, easily move into tumor tissues after crossing the endothelium barrier. Furthermore, solid tumors have a poor lymphatic drainage system, leading to extended retention times of nanocarriers in the tumor extracellular matrix."

                            "The Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) effect is a phenomenon that leads to the enhanced accumulation and retention of macromolecules and nanoparticles in solid tumors compared to normal tissues (Bertrand et al., 2014)(Lammers et al., 2012). This improved accumulation results from the tumor vasculature that grows abnormally in order to feed the rapidly growing tumor. This results in leaks in the vasculature, from which nanomedicines can penetrate the tumor. However, the EPR effect is not a universal property of all solid tumors and care should be taken when exploring this route of passive tumor targeting (Lammers et al., 2012). Some tumors have a very dense extracellular matrix with very limited EPR-based accumulation (e.g., pancreatic ductal carcinoma). In addition, analysis from 200 different patient tumors across eight different cancer types have revealed marked differences in the tumor vasculature and morphology, observed between tumor types, between tumors of the same type, and even within the same tumor (Golombek et al., 2018)(Lammers et al., 2012)."

The EPR effect is manifested by enhanced accumulation of macromolecules (e.g. liposomes, drugs, and NPs) in tumor tissues in contrast to normal tissues. The mechanism underlying this effect is attributed to the leaky vessels around tumors as well as dysfunctional lymphatic system (Perrault et al., 2010)(Maeda, 2013). The blood vessels with such leaky pores can augment the transport of circulating nanoparticles into the tumor. On the other hand, the transportation in nonmalignant tissues is hindered by the intact barrier of the vasculature. EPR effect has been proposed to be due to the rapid growth of tumor cells, which require surplus amounts of crucial nutrients; thus, inducing the dysregulated formation of blood vasculatures",

This spatial heterogeneity of lymphatic function within tumors creates a complex environment that simultaneously promotes nanoparticle retention and enables cancer cell dissemination.\n\nEndothelial cells in tumor vasculature exhibit distinct characteristics that influence both the EPR effect and metastatic potential.

These molecular differences contribute to the hyperpermeability of vessels in metastatic tumors and potentially facilitate both the EPR effect and metastatic progression.\n\nThe presence of the EPR effect in metastatic lesions remains a subject of ongoing investigation, with somewhat conflicting findings.

For instance, in a study of lymph node metastasis, the EPR effect was not detected until day 29 post-inoculation, suggesting that systemic nanoparticle-based chemotherapy might not be effective during early metastatic stages <Paper corpusId=\"13578458\" paperTitle=\"(Mikada et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe heterogeneity of the EPR effect across different tumor types and stages has significant implications for the treatment of metastatic disease <Paper corpusId=\"53104302\" paperTitle=\"(Adjei et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"4784007\" paperTitle=\"(Hansen et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>. As metastatic lesions develop and establish their own vasculature, they may exhibit varying degrees of vascular permeability and lymphatic dysfunction, resulting in different levels of nanoparticle accumulation.

Based on the EPR effect concept, a positive targeting of micelles containing anticancer drug to cancer has been reported (Cabral et al., 2014)(Matsumura et al., 2009). Thus, there are some structural and functional differences between the cancer and normal blood vessels. To study cancer characteristics or therapeutic efficacy, the blood vessel properties and the cancer-endothelial cell interaction are important to consider. Some research has been reported to demonstrate that tumor endothelial cells (TEC) differ from normal endothelial cells in properties, such as the cell proliferation, the gene expression, the response to growth factors, or migration (Akino et al., 2009)(Amin et al., 2006). High metastatic tumor-derived TEC (HM-TEC) and low metastatic tumor-derived TEC (LM-TEC) can be isolated from mice. It is demonstrated that the secretion levels of VEGF, MMP-2, MMP-9, and SDF-1 from HM-TEC are higher than from that of LM-TEC (Hida et al., 2013)(Kurosu et al., 2011)."

                            "Epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor family members are expressed by tumor cells and contribute to tumor progression. The expression and activity of EGF receptors in endothelial cells are less well characterized. Analysis of tumor-derived endothelial cells showed that they express EGFR, ErbB2, and ErbB4, whereas their normal counterparts express ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4. The gain in expression of EGFR and the loss of ErbB3 expression in tumor vasculature was also observed in vivo. As a consequence of their expressing EGFR, tumor endothelial cells responded to EGF and other EGF family members by activating both EGFR and ErbB2, by activating the downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, and by enhanced proliferation. On the other hand, normal endothelial cells did not respond to EGF but instead were responsive to neuregulin (NRG), a ligand for ErbB3 and ErbB4. NRG activated ErbB3 in normal endothelial cells and inhibited growth of these cells. In contrast, tumor endothelial cells, which do not express ErbB3, were not growth inhibited by NRG. Furthermore, due to their expression of EGFR, tumor endothelial cells, unlike normal endothelial cells, are direct targets for EGFR kinase inhibitors. These low-molecular-weight compounds block EGF-induced EGFR activation and proliferation of tumor endothelial cells. These results suggest that a gain of EGF-induced endothelial cell proliferation, and loss of NRG-induced growth inhibition in tumor endothelial cells constitutes a switch that promotes tumor angiogenesis. In addition, these results suggest that EGFR kinase inhibitors may be effective for antiangiogenesis therapy by specifically targeting the tumor, but not the normal, vasculature."

                            "Background:Tumour stromal cells differ from its normal counterpart. We have shown that tumour endothelial cells (TECs) isolated from tumour tissues are also abnormal. Furthermore, we found that mRNAs of vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) were upregulated in TECs. Vascular endothelial growth factor-A and COX-2 are angiogenic factors and their mRNAs contain an AU-rich element (ARE). AU-rich element-containing mRNAs are reportedly stabilised by Hu antigen R (HuR), which is exported to the cytoplasm.Methods:Normal endothelial cell (NEC) and two types of TECs were isolated. We evaluated the correlation of HuR and accumulation of VEGF-A and COX-2 mRNAs in TECs and effects of HuR on biological phenotypes of TECs.Results:The HuR protein was accumulated in the cytoplasm of TECs, but not in NECs. Vascular endothelial growth factor-A and COX-2 mRNA levels decreased due to HuR knockdown and it was shown that these ARE-mRNA were bound to HuR in TECs. Furthermore, HuR knockdown inhibited cell survival, random motility, tube formation, and Akt phosphorylation in TECs.Conclusion:Hu antigen R is associated with the upregulation of VEGF-A and COX-2 mRNA in TECs, and has an important role in keeping an angiogenic switch on, through activating angiogenic phenotype in tumour endothelium."

                            "The effectiveness of NPs is dependent on their accumulation in vascularized solid tumors via the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. Fast-growing tumors develop poorly organized vasculature with large endothelial fenestrations that allows NPs to accumulate in the tumor interstitium. Tumors also have impaired lymphatic drainage that enhances NP retention in the tumor (Fang et al., 2011)(Nichols et al., 2014). Although the EPR effect has served as the foundation for most cancer nanomedicines, there is heterogeneity in its presentation based on tumor type and patient population. Furthermore, the size of a tumor and the heterogeneous tumor microenvironment affect the EPR effect (Hansen et al., 2015). The existence of the EPR effect in metastasis is an unresolved question, with studies reporting that metastases exhibit the phenomenon (Maeda, 2015), while others report otherwise, especially in early-stage metastasis (Mikada et al., 2017)."

                            "Most solid cancers spread to new sites via the lymphatics before hematogenous dissemination. However, only a small fraction of an intravenously administered anti\u2010cancer drug enters the lymphatic system to reach metastatic lymph nodes (LN). Here, we show that the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect is not induced during the early stages of LN metastasis. Luciferase\u2010expressing tumor cells were injected into the subiliac LN of the MXH10/Mo\u2010lpr/lpr mouse to induce metastasis to the proper axillary LN (PALN). In vivo biofluorescence imaging was used to confirm metastasis induction and to quantify the EPR effect, measured as PALN accumulation of intravenously injected indocyanine green (ICG) liposomes. PALN blood vessel volume changes were measured by contrast\u2010enhanced high\u2010frequency ultrasound imaging. The volume and density of blood vessels in the PALN increased until day 29 after inoculation, whereas the LN volume remained constant. ICG retention was first detected on day 29 post\u2010inoculation. While CD31\u2010positive cells increased up to day 29 post\u2010inoculation, \u03b1\u2010smooth muscle actin\u2010positive cells were detected on day 29 post\u2010inoculation for the first time. These results suggest that the EPR effect was not induced in the early stages of LN metastasis; therefore, systemic chemotherapy would likely not be beneficial during the early stages of LN metastasis. The development of an alternative drug delivery system, independent of the EPR effect, is required for the treatment of LN metastasis."

                            "Since the first report of the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, the research in nanocarrier based antitumor drugs has been intense. The field has been devoted to treatment of cancer by exploiting EPR-based accumulation of nanocarriers in solid tumors, which for many years was considered to be a ubiquitous phenomenon. However, the understanding of differences in the EPR-effect between tumor types, heterogeneities within each patient group, and dependency on tumor development stage in humans is sparse. It is therefore important to enhance our understanding of the EPR-effect in large animals and humans with spontaneously developed cancer. In the present paper, we describe a novel loading method of copper-64 into PEGylated liposomes and use these liposomes to evaluate the EPR-effect in 11 canine cancer patients with spontaneous solid tumors by PET/CT imaging. We thereby provide the first high-resolution analysis of EPR-based tumor accumulation in large animals. We find that the EPR-effect is strong in some tumor types but cannot be considered a general feature of solid malignant tumors since we observed a high degree of accumulation heterogeneity between tumors. Six of seven included carcinomas displayed high uptake levels of liposomes, whereas one of four sarcomas displayed signs of liposome retention. We conclude that nanocarrier-radiotracers could be important in identifying cancer patients that will benefit from nanocarrier-based therapeutics in clinical practice."

                "text": "\nDespite its fundamental role in nanomedicine development, the EPR effect exhibits significant heterogeneity that limits its universal application across all cancers.

Analysis of 200 different patient tumors across eight cancer types revealed marked differences in tumor vasculature and morphology, highlighting the variable nature of the EPR effect <Paper corpusId=\"226219426\" paperTitle=\"(Gaspar et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. These variations stem from multiple factors operating at both vascular and microenvironmental levels.\n\nAt the vascular level, key contributors to EPR heterogeneity include differences in vascular permeability, expression of endothelial receptors, and varying degrees of vascular maturation. Microenvironmental factors further complicating the EPR effect include extracellular matrix composition, presence of hypoxia, interstitial fluid pressure, and tumor cell density <Paper corpusId=\"208331092\" paperTitle=\"(Dammes et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. This complex interplay of factors results in unpredictable drug accumulation patterns and variable treatment outcomes between patients.\n\nThe EPR effect is notably absent or insignificant in several important clinical scenarios. Blood cancers, very early-stage tumors, and small metastasized cancers typically exhibit minimal or no EPR effect <Paper corpusId=\"227260630\" paperTitle=\"(Fu et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. Early-stage tumors often have more organized vasculature that lacks the leakiness characteristic of more advanced tumors, limiting passive targeting opportunities <Paper corpusId=\"53104302\" paperTitle=\"(Adjei et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>. Additionally, the EPR effect in metastatic lesions remains controversial, with some studies reporting its presence in metastases while others indicate its absence, particularly in early-stage metastatic disease <Paper corpusId=\"53104302\" paperTitle=\"(Adjei et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"13578458\" paperTitle=\"(Mikada et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nCertain tumor types present significant barriers to EPR-based drug delivery due to their specific structural characteristics. Pancreatic ductal carcinoma, for example, is characterized by a very dense extracellular matrix that severely restricts nanoparticle penetration and accumulation <Paper corpusId=\"226219426\" paperTitle=\"(Gaspar et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. This limitation highlights how tumor-specific barriers can override the potential benefits of leaky vasculature.\n\nVascular permeability in tumors changes as they progress and varies depending on anatomical location <Paper corpusId=\"237459096\" paperTitle=\"(Sedush et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"265650171\" paperTitle=\"(Chalodiya et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.

In addition, while the tumor vasculature may be hyperpermeable, the high density of stromal cells and matrix proteins, combined with elevated interstitial fluid pressure, creates barriers limiting drug delivery to the tumor core <Paper corpusId=\"267639255\" paperTitle=\"(Haze et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nResearch has identified specific phenotypic characteristics of EPR-insensitive tumors, including smaller endothelial fenestrations, heterogeneous pericyte coverage, more developed and branched vasculature, relatively dense extracellular matrix, and more developed immune profiles compared to EPR-sensitive tumors <Paper corpusId=\"232775475\" paperTitle=\"(Kim et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"204826101\" paperTitle=\"(Dhaliwal et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. These characteristics make certain tumors inherently resistant to passive targeting strategies.\n\nRecent studies have questioned the fundamental mechanisms of the EPR effect. Work by Chan and colleagues suggests that up to 97% of nanoparticles may not enter tumors through passive paracellular transport (the traditional explanation of the EPR effect) but rather through active transcellular processes involving endothelial cells <Paper corpusId=\"265146916\" paperTitle=\"(Wang et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This challenges the long-held view of the EPR effect as simply a passive phenomenon and suggests more complex mechanisms are involved in nanoparticle accumulation in tumors.\n\nGiven these significant limitations and heterogeneity, there is growing recognition that the EPR effect cannot be relied upon as the sole mechanism for tumor-targeted drug delivery across all cancer types and stages. Alternative targeting strategies that can function independently of the EPR effect, or approaches that can enhance the EPR effect in otherwise insensitive tumors, are needed to expand the clinical applicability of nanomedicine-based cancer therapies <Paper corpusId=\"204826101\" paperTitle=\"(Dhaliwal et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>.",

This improved accumulation results from the tumor vasculature that grows abnormally in order to feed the rapidly growing tumor. This results in leaks in the vasculature, from which nanomedicines can penetrate the tumor. However, the EPR effect is not a universal property of all solid tumors and care should be taken when exploring this route of passive tumor targeting (Lammers et al., 2012). Some tumors have a very dense extracellular matrix with very limited EPR-based accumulation (e.g., pancreatic ductal carcinoma). In addition, analysis from 200 different patient tumors across eight different cancer types have revealed marked differences in the tumor vasculature and morphology, observed between tumor types, between tumors of the same type, and even within the same tumor (Golombek et al., 2018)(Lammers et al., 2012)."

                            "Due to the rapid growth of tumors, the surrounding blood vessels have a defective architecture and in some cases produce various permeability factors to ensure sufficient influx of oxygen and nutrients [89]. This feature is exploited in cancer therapy to enhance tumor accumulation of macromolecules. The molecules first pass the endothelial barrier followed by movement through the tumor interstitium and extracellular matrix before they reach the tumor cells. Generally, compounds greater than 40 kDa benefit from the EPR effect and can accumulate at the tumor site. An additional benefit of these macromolecules is their prolonged circulation time compared to smaller molecules that are rapidly cleared by the liver and kidneys [49]. While targeted molecules have tumor targeting abilities, their initial diffusion from the vasculature into the tumor tissue relies on the EPR effect like untargeted molecules. Due to the inter-and intra-patient heterogeneity of the EPR effect, treatment efficacy varies between patients, leading to dissimilar outcomes in clinical trials. The EPR effect is so heterologous because multiple vascular as well as micro-environmental factors contribute to the EPR. At the vascular level, main contributors are vascular permeability, expression of endothelial receptors and the degree of vascular maturation (as tumors rapidly enhance angiogenesis the maturation state is significantly different from healthy tissues). Micro-environmental contributors include the extracellular matrix, presence of hypoxia, interstitial fluid pressure and tumor cell density [90]. When taking into account all these different contributors, one can imagine the complexity and understand the heterogeneous nature. Because of this EPR heterogeneity, antibodies provide an opportunity for active targeting that can enhance the passive targeting of the EPR effect."

                            "The effectiveness of NPs is dependent on their accumulation in vascularized solid tumors via the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. Fast-growing tumors develop poorly organized vasculature with large endothelial fenestrations that allows NPs to accumulate in the tumor interstitium. Tumors also have impaired lymphatic drainage that enhances NP retention in the tumor (Fang et al., 2011)(Nichols et al., 2014). Although the EPR effect has served as the foundation for most cancer nanomedicines, there is heterogeneity in its presentation based on tumor type and patient population. Furthermore, the size of a tumor and the heterogeneous tumor microenvironment affect the EPR effect (Hansen et al., 2015). The existence of the EPR effect in metastasis is an unresolved question, with studies reporting that metastases exhibit the phenomenon (Maeda, 2015), while others report otherwise, especially in early-stage metastasis (Mikada et al., 2017)."

                            "Most solid cancers spread to new sites via the lymphatics before hematogenous dissemination. However, only a small fraction of an intravenously administered anti\u2010cancer drug enters the lymphatic system to reach metastatic lymph nodes (LN). Here, we show that the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect is not induced during the early stages of LN metastasis. Luciferase\u2010expressing tumor cells were injected into the subiliac LN of the MXH10/Mo\u2010lpr/lpr mouse to induce metastasis to the proper axillary LN (PALN). In vivo biofluorescence imaging was used to confirm metastasis induction and to quantify the EPR effect, measured as PALN accumulation of intravenously injected indocyanine green (ICG) liposomes. PALN blood vessel volume changes were measured by contrast\u2010enhanced high\u2010frequency ultrasound imaging. The volume and density of blood vessels in the PALN increased until day 29 after inoculation, whereas the LN volume remained constant. ICG retention was first detected on day 29 post\u2010inoculation. While CD31\u2010positive cells increased up to day 29 post\u2010inoculation, \u03b1\u2010smooth muscle actin\u2010positive cells were detected on day 29 post\u2010inoculation for the first time. These results suggest that the EPR effect was not induced in the early stages of LN metastasis; therefore, systemic chemotherapy would likely not be beneficial during the early stages of LN metastasis. The development of an alternative drug delivery system, independent of the EPR effect, is required for the treatment of LN metastasis."

                            "Passive targeting to solid tumors can be achieved through the enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR effect), as first described in the 1980s [13,14]. Pathological, pharmacological, and biochemical studies have shown that a solid tumor usually has such pathophysiological characteristics as hypervascularization, incomplete vascular architecture, and secretion of vascular permeability factors that stimulate extravasation and immaturity of lymphatic capillaries [15]. The tumor vasculature is characterized by a high proportion of proliferating endothelial cells, increased tortuosity, pericyte deficiency, and the formation of an atypical membrane. All this leads to rapid vascularization of the tumor, which is necessary to provide it with oxygen and nutrients and further proliferation. These characteristics make tumor blood vessels permeable to macromolecules. In addition, the lymphatic drainage system of the tumor functions ineffectively due to immature lymphatic capillaries; thus, nanocarriers are selectively preserved for a long period in the interstitial tissue of the tumor [15]. Numerous studies have shown that the EPR effect induces passive accumulation of macromolecules and micelles in solid tumors, enhancing the therapeutic effect while reducing side effects. It was also found that in most human tumors the effective pore size in the vasculature ranges from 200 to 600 nm in diameter, which allows passive targeting of tumors [16]. It was noted that the secretion of various factors such as nitric oxide, prostaglandins, bradykinin, and the main growth factor of fibroblasts in tumor tissues and overexpression of genes (such as vascular permeability factor or vascular endothelial growth factor) cause hyperpermeability of tumor microvessels. However, let us note that vascular permeability in the tumor changes with its progression and depends on the type of tumor and its anatomical location."

                            "Since the first report of the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, the research in nanocarrier based antitumor drugs has been intense. The field has been devoted to treatment of cancer by exploiting EPR-based accumulation of nanocarriers in solid tumors, which for many years was considered to be a ubiquitous phenomenon. However, the understanding of differences in the EPR-effect between tumor types, heterogeneities within each patient group, and dependency on tumor development stage in humans is sparse. It is therefore important to enhance our understanding of the EPR-effect in large animals and humans with spontaneously developed cancer. In the present paper, we describe a novel loading method of copper-64 into PEGylated liposomes and use these liposomes to evaluate the EPR-effect in 11 canine cancer patients with spontaneous solid tumors by PET/CT imaging. We thereby provide the first high-resolution analysis of EPR-based tumor accumulation in large animals. We find that the EPR-effect is strong in some tumor types but cannot be considered a general feature of solid malignant tumors since we observed a high degree of accumulation heterogeneity between tumors. Six of seven included carcinomas displayed high uptake levels of liposomes, whereas one of four sarcomas displayed signs of liposome retention. We conclude that nanocarrier-radiotracers could be important in identifying cancer patients that will benefit from nanocarrier-based therapeutics in clinical practice."

EPR effect is usually induced by a leaky tumor vasculature by the accelerated angiogenesis and impaired lymphatic drainage by the disorganized growth of tumors (Greish, 2010)(Dhaliwal et al., 2019). In details, NPs with appropriate sizes can evade the tumor capillaries and be retained in the tumor tissues for days due to the lack of lymphatic drainage. Additionally, particles with high positive charges can bind non-specifically to the negatively charged luminal surface due to the presence of sulfate and carboxylate sugar moieties [106]",

                            "The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect has underlain the predominant nanomedicine design philosophy for the past three decades. However, growing evidence suggests that it is over-represented in preclinical models, and agents designed solely using its principle of passive accumulation can only be applied to a narrow subset of clinical tumors. For this reason, strategies that can improve upon the EPR effect to facilitate nanomedicine delivery to otherwise non-responsive tumors are required for broad clinical translation. EPR-adaptive nanomedicine delivery comprises a class of chemical and physical techniques that modify tumor accessibility in an effort to increase agent delivery and therapeutic effect. In the present review, we overview the primary benefits and limitations of radiation, ultrasound, hyperthermia, and photodynamic therapy as physical strategies for EPR-adaptive delivery to EPR-insensitive tumor phenotypes, and we reflect upon changes in the preclinical research pathway that should be implemented in order to optimally validate and develop these delivery strategies."

Although the EPR effect has been used as the \"gold standard\" for the design of most cancertargeted drugs, there are still many controversies and deficiencies. A study by Chan et al. showed that up to 97% of nanoparticles are not passively transported through the leaky endothelium into the tumor site by paracellular transport but are transported by an active process through endothelial cells. This calls into question the true role of the EPR effect in nanodrug delivery. 131"

                            "Passive targeting of tumor cells can be accomplished through the exploitation of the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, which is characteristic of tumor tissues. This effect arises due to the presence of leaky endothelium in tumor vasculature, resulting in a higher accumulation rate of drug-loaded nanocarriers within the tumor compared to healthy tissues. Additionally, the compromised lymphatic system in tumors contributes to the retention of nanoparticles, and both these phenomena collectively define the EPR effect (Nakamura et al., 2016). Passive targeting offers a significant improvement in specificity, around 20-30%, when compared to healthy organs. The effectiveness of EPR-based passive targeting relies on various factors related to nanocarrier properties, such as size, charge, and surface chemistry, as well as the challenges associated with achieving precise cell targeting within malignant tumors (Albanese et al., 2012)(Attia et al., 2019)."

As EVs are a type of nanoparticle, it is plausible that they may be subject to EPR (Phillips et al., 2021). EPR is observed in various solid tumors, and is characterized by abnormal tumor vasculature, tumor permeability, and a lack of effective lymphatic drainage (Wu, 2021). The leaky tumor vasculature allows for nanoparticles to extravasate through surrounding blood vessels (Maeda et al., 2013). Together, these function to help nanoparticles persist and accumulate in tumors, allowing for retention and direct delivery to the site of interest (Wu, 2021)."

                            "Chemotherapy for human solid tumors in clinical practice is far from satisfactory. Despite the discovery and synthesis of hundreds of thousands of anticancer compounds targeting various crucial units in cancer cell proliferation and metabolism, the fundamental problem is the lack of targeting delivery of these compounds selectively into solid tumor tissue to maintain an effective concentration level for a certain length of time for drug-tumor interaction to execute anticancer activities. The enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR effect) describes a universal pathophysiological phenomenon and mechanism in which macromolecular compounds such as albumin and other polymer-conjugated drugs beyond certain sizes (above 40 kDa) can progressively accumulate in the tumor vascularized area and thus achieve targeting delivery and retention of anticancer compounds into solid tumor tissue. Targeting therapy via the EPR effect in clinical practice is not always successful since the strength of the EPR effect varies depending on the type and location of tumors, status of blood perfusion in tumors, and the physical-chemical properties of macromolecular anticancer agents. This review highlights the significance of the concept and mechanism of the EPR effect and discusses methods for better utilizing the EPR effect in developing smarter macromolecular nanomedicine to achieve a satisfactory outcome in clinical applications."

                            "Nanotechnology offers several attractive design features that have prompted its exploration for cancer diagnosis and treatment. Nanosized drugs have a large loading capacity, the ability to protect the payload from degradation, a large surface on which to conjugate targeting ligands, and controlled or sustained release. Nanosized drugs also leak preferentially into tumor tissue through permeable tumor vessels and are then retained in the tumor bed due to reduced lymphatic drainage. This process is known as the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. However, while the EPR effect is widely held to improve delivery of nanodrugs to tumors, it in fact offers less than a 2-fold increase in nanodrug delivery compared with critical normal organs, resulting in drug concentrations that are not sufficient for curing most cancers. In this Review, we first overview various barriers for nanosized drug delivery with an emphasis on the capillary wall's resistance, the main obstacle to delivering drugs. Then, we discuss current regulatory issues facing nanomedicine. Finally, we discuss how to make the delivery of nanosized drugs to tumors more effective by building on the EPR effect."

                            "Passive targeting is mainly based on the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect.\n\nIn 1986, Maeda and co-workers named EPR effect to the mechanism in which macromolecules with a high molecular weight, 15000 to 70000 daltons, such as polymers and proteins precipitate and accumulate effectively in tumor tissues [45]. Such high accumulation usually last more than 24 hours [45]. This phenomenon was attributed to the hypervasculature and enhanced vascular permeability in solid tumors, which is due to the overproduction of vascular mediators including bradykinin, nitric oxide (NO), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and carbon monoxide (CO) [46]. Moreover, solid tumors have defective blood vessels with large gaps, up to 1.0 \u03bcm between endothelial cells, whereby macromolecules pass to the tumor [14]. Since solid tumors lack adequate lymphatic drainage, there is therefore a poor circulatory recovery of the extravasated macromolecules, resulting in their accumulation in the tumor microenvironment for long periods [14]. This phenomenon was not observed in healthy blood vessels [45]; hence, it constituted a promising strategy to treat selectively cancer solid tumors using nanocarriers like polymer-coated liposomes [47]."

                            "The use of liposomes for drug delivery began early in the history of pharmaceutical nanocarriers. These nanosized, lipid bilayered vesicles have become popular as drug delivery systems owing to their efficiency, biocompatibility, nonimmunogenicity, enhanced solubility of chemotherapeutic agents and their ability to encapsulate a wide array of drugs. Passive and ligand-mediated active targeting promote tumor specificity with diminished adverse off-target effects. The current field of liposomes focuses on both clinical and diagnostic applications. Recent efforts have concentrated on the development of multifunctional liposomes that target cells and cellular organelles with a single delivery system. This review discusses the recent advances in liposome research in tumor targeting."
